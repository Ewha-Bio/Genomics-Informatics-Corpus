No Evidence of Association of Interleukin 1A (-889) Genetic Polymorphism with Alzheimer’s Disease in Koreans
To examine whether the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism associates with a risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and acts interactively with the apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 in the development of AD, we performed genotype analyses of the IL-1A and the APOE of the 102 Korean AD patients and 200 Korean non-demented controls. We failed to detect a significant difference in genotypic and allelic frequencies of IL-1A between the AD group and control group. No overexpression of the IL-1A C/T genotype and IL-1A T allele was found when we analyzed the late-onset and early-onset patients, separately. There was no significant genetic interaction between IL-1A polymorphism and the APOE polymorphism. In conclusion, the IL-1A polymorphism did not contribute to the development of AD independently or interactively with the APOE ε4 allele in Koreans. lnterleukin-1 (IL-1), a potent acute phase proinflammatory cytokine, is known to play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It was reported to regulate amyloid beta protein (Aβ) production and increase the phosphorylation of tau protein (Sheng et al., 1996, 2000). Its level was elevated in cerebral cortex and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and activated IL-1 immunoreactive microglia were also proliferated significantly in the cerebral cortex of AD patients (Griffin et al., 1989; Cacabelos et al., 1991).
In 2000, Grimaldi and his colleagues reported that the genetic polymorphism in the promoter region of IL-1A (-889) was significantly associated with the risk of AD. In their population, the IL-1A T allele conferred the risk of AD in dose-dependent manner. The odds ratios for AD in the IL-1A T-heterozygous subjects were 1.84 and those of IL-1A T-homozygous subjects were 6.33. The association of AD with IL-1A polymorphism was also replicated in several other populations (Du et al., 2000; Nicoll et al., 2000; Rebeck, 2000; Combarros et al., 2002; Hedley et al., 2002). Moreover, this polymorphism might be functional. The IL-1A TT genotype significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the IL-1 alpha gene with respect to the CC genotype (Dominici et al., 2002).
However, there was substantial ethnic difference in the allelic frequency of the IL-1A (-889) T and IL-1A T-conferred AD risk. While the frequency of the IL-1A T was 17.8%-33% in Caucasians (Du et al., 2000; Grimaldi et al., 2000; Minster et al., 2000; Nicoll et al., 2000; Rebeck, 2000; Kolsch et al., 2001; Combarros et al., 2002; Fidani et al., 2002; Green et al., 2002; Hedley et al., 2002; Pirskanen et al., 2002), it was less than 11.3% in East Asians (Ki et al., 2001; Kuo et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2003) and the IL-1A T-AD association was not significant in Asians (Ki et al., 2001; Kuo et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2003).
Therefore we investigated the association of AD with the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism and examined its interaction with APOE polymorphism in the development of AD in Koreans.
The AD patients were selected from the patients who had visited the dementia clinic at Seoul National University Hospital and from the community-dwelling elderly individuals in three districts of Seoul (Kwanak-gu, Seocho-gu, Nowon-gu). All the non-demented normal control subjects were community-dwelling elderly individuals randomly selected from those three districts. We administered the Korean version of the CERAD assessment packet (Lee et al., 2002) and Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score (MHIS) (Rosen et al., 1980) to all the subjects. Following this evaluation, a diagnosis for each subject was made at a consensus meeting; diagnoses for dementia were made according to DSM-IV criteria (APA, 1994) and diagnoses for probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria (McKhann et al., 1984). The subjects who were diagnosed as cognitively normal and got less than 3 of MHIS were included in the normal control group. Age-at-onset was defined as the age at which the patient or his family first noticed the symptoms required for the diagnosis. The cut-off between late-onset AD and early-onset AD was 65 years of age. The control subjects were also divided into the young controls aged 64 years or less and the old controls aged 65 years or over. The subjects with cerebrovascular disorders, neurologic disorders, and psychiatric disorders including depression were excluded from the patient group as well as the control group. The Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital, Korea, approved the study protocol and informed consent was obtained from all participants or their guardians.
Genomic DNA for genotyping was extracted from peripheral venous blood. IL-1A (-889) polymorphism was determined using a dynamic allele specific hybridization method (DASH) (Howell et al., 1999). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (forward, 5'-TTTTTACATAT GAGCCTTCAAT-3'; biotinylated reverse, 5'-TTAATAATAG TAACCAGGCAAC-3') and the two fluorescent labeled probes (5'-AGGCAACATCAT TGAAG-3' and 5-AGGCA ACACCATTGAAG-3'), complementary to the both allelic sequences of the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism, were added to a 96-well microtiter plate, and PCR was then performed. After PCR, the plate was placed in a DASH instrument (Hybaid ltd.) and heated from 35°C to 85°C at a rate of 0.3°C/sec. Probe-duplex denaturation was determined by the decrease in fluorescence. The IL-1A (-889) genotypes were determined from the fluorescence curves as previously described (Howell et al., 1999). APOE genotyping was performed using a slight modification of the method reported by Wenham et al. (1991).
The differences in both allele and genotype frequency between the AD patients and the control subjects were compared using either a Fisher's exact test or Pearson Chi square test when appropriate. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age (age at onset for AD), gender and APOE genotype were performed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) associated with the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism on the risk for AD. And the age at onset between groups was compared using Student T test. SPSS version 10.0 for Windows was used for these statistical analyses.
A total of 102 sporadic AD patients and 200 controls were enrolled in this study. Among the 102 AD patients, 34 subjects were early-onset AD patients (age at onset = 58.8+3.7 years, age -62.8+3.6 years, range = 54-71 years, 58.3% female) and 68 subjects were late-onset AD patients (age at onset = 75.3±35.9 years, age = 78.3±5.8 years, range -67-97 years, 67.6% female). The 200 control subjects were also stratified by age into 38 young controls (age = 60.8±3.0 years, range = 53-64 years, 89.5% female) and 162 old controls (age = 72.6±5.7 years, range = 65-88 years, 72.8% female). There were no significant differences in the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the IL-1A polymorphism between the AD patients and control subjects (Table 1). The distributions of the IL-1A (-889) and APOE genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both the AD patients and controls. The frequency of the T allele was 7.5% in our normal elderly controls, and the IL-1A T-homozygous subject was not observed in both the patient group and control group, which was quite consistent with the previously reported results in Koreans (Ki et al., 2001).
As expected, the APOE e4 was more prevalent in the AD patients than in the controls (p<0.00001). However, the IL-1A T allele was not overrepresented in the AD group compared with the control group (P>0.1). The IL-1A T-AD association was not significant either after stratifying the subjects by the type of AD (Table 1) or the presence of APOE ε4 allele (Table 2). The age-and gender-adjusted odds ratio for AD conferred to the IL-1A T was 0.61 (95% C.I. = 0.27-1.37), and the interaction term between the IL-1A T and the APOE ε4 was not significant in logistic regression analysis.
The age-at-onset was not influenced by the IL-1A polymorphism. The mean age-at-onset of the AD patients with the IL-1A C/C genotype (69.9±9.4 years) was not different from that of the AD patients with IL-1A C/T genotype (69.0±9.4 years).
In this study, we did not find a significant association between the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism and AD risk in Koreans, which is consistent with the three previous studies on Asians (Ki et al., 2001; Kuo et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2003). However, the absence of association between the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism and AD in the present study is not merely attributed to the ethnic difference. Five out of the 11 previous studies on Caucasians could not find any significant association either (Minster et al., 2000; Kolsch et al., 2001; Fidani et al., 2002; Green et al., 2002; Pirskanen et al., 2002). Therefore, another factors including lack of power and linkage disequilibrium of IL-1A (-889) polymorphism with other nearby responsible gene on chromosome 2 could be the sources of the conflicting results.
The frequency of the IL-1A T allele in our controls, 7.5%, was much lower than those of Caucasians which were reported to be 17.8%-33% (Du et al., 2000; Grimaldi et al., 2000; Minster et al., 2000; Nicoll et al., 2000; Rebeck, 2000; Kolsch et al., 2001; Combarros et al., 2002; Fidani et al., 2002; Green et al., 2002; Hedley et al., 2002; Pirskanen et al., 2002), but it was similar to thoseof East Asians (7.1%-11.3%; Ki et al., 2001; Kuo et al., 2003; Tsai et al., 2003). Therefore, in East Asians, much larger sample size may be required for verifying the same odds ratio for AD conferred to the IL-1A T compared with Caucasians. Because of this lowT allele frequency as well as the insufficient sample size, the power of the present study was 65% if we considered that the odds of the IL-1A (-889) T allele for AD were 2.
Moreover, there was no IL-1A T homozygous subject in our sample. Among the six previous positive studies (Du et al., 2000; Grimaldi et al., 2000; Nicoll et al., 2000; Rebeck, 2000; Combarros et al., 2002; Hedley et al., 2002), three studies found that only T/T genotype was significantly associated with AD risk (Nicoll et al., 2000; Rebeck, 2000; Hedley et al., 2002). Therefore the association between AD and IL-1A T/T in Korean was not examined in the present study, and waits for further investigation in an extended sample. In other three studies that the dose-dependent AD risk conferred to IL-1A T allele was confirmed (Du et al., 2000; Grimaldi et al., 2000; Combarros et al., 2002), the AD risks conferred to IL-1 A (-889) C/T genotype were less than 2 (1.39 -1.84). This modest contribution of IL-1A T allele may further complicate the power of present study.
Age-at-onset was also suggested to be a confounding factor to influence on the association of IL-1A (-889) polymorphism with AD. While the association of AD with IL-1A (-889) polymorphism was significant only in early-onset cases in Glimaldi et al. (2000) and Rebeck (2000), it was significant only in late-onset cases in Hedley et al. (2002). Therefore, the limited association of IL-1A (-889) polymorphism with AD according to age at onset is still controversial. In the present study, the association of IL-1A (-889) was not found either in the early onset AD patients or in the late-onset AD patients.
Combarros et al. (2002) reported that in the presence of the APOE e4 allele the relative risk of IL-1A (-889) T allele carriers was approximately double the risk of IL-1A (-889) T allele non-carriers. However, in the present study, the association of AD with the IL-1A (-889) T was not significant regardless of the presence or absence of the APOE e4 allele. Thus the absence of the AD-IL-1A (-889) T association in our sample was not a biased result confounded by the APOE polymorphism.
In conclusion, we failed to find any evidence supporting an association between the IL-1A (-889) genetic polymorphism and AD in Koreans. We also did not find any significant association after the stratification according to age at onset or APOE genotype.
