Identification of Genetic Variations in CBL, SORBS1, CRK, and RHOQ, Key Modulators in the CAP/TC10 Pathway of Insulin Signal Transduction, and Their Association with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the Korean Population.

 Recent evidence has strongly suggested that the CAP/TC10 pathway is involved in the trafficking, docking, and fusion of vesicles containing the insulin-responsive glucose transporter Glut4 to the plasma membrane. However, little is known about how the genes employed in the CAP/TC10 pathway are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we sequenced 4 genes of the CAP/TC10 pathway [SORBS1, CBL, CRK, and RHOQ] in 24 individuals to identify genetic variations in these loci. A total of 48 sequence variants were identified, including 23 novel variations. To investigate the possible association with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms from SORBS1, 3 from CBL, and 4 from RHOQ were genotyped in 1122 Korean type 2 diabetic patients and 1138 nondiabetic controls. Using logistic regression analysis, 1 significant association between SNP rs1376405 in RHOQ and type 2 diabetes mellitus [OR = 8.714 (C. I. 1.714-44.29), p = 0.009] was found in the recessive model. Our data demonstrate a positive association of the RHOQ gene in the CAP/TC10 pathway with T2DM in the Korean population. During recent years, major advances have been made in our understanding of insulin actions. In the cell, the recognition of insulin by insulin receptor instigates phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, such as the insulin receptor substrates (IRS14) (White and Yenush, 1998), calcineurin Blike protein 1 (Cbl1) (Ribon and Saltiel, 1997), Src homology 2 domaincontaining transforming protein (Shc) (Sasaoka et al., 1994), SH2B adaptor protein 2 (SH2B2) (Liu et al., 2002), and p60DOK (Noguchi et al., 1999). Defects in genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway are linked to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Zierath and WallbergHenriksson, 2002). In the CAP/TC10 pathway, the insulin receptor recruits and phosphorylates Cbl proteins through an intermediary adaptor protein called SH2B2 (Liu, et al., 2002). Binding of the SH2 domain of SH2B2 to the phosphorylated insulin receptor facilitates phosphorylation of SH2B2, which then serves as a docking site for Cbl (Hu and Hubbard, 2005). Another adaptor protein, termed sorbin, and SH2 domaincontaining 1 (SORBS1), which is a human homolog of Cblassociated protein (CAP), are involved in the targeting of Cbl to lipid raft microdomains (Ribon et al., 1998). Upon phosphorylation of Cbl, the Cbl/CAP complex provides docking sites for the recruitment of the adaptor protein CRKII and the guanyl nucleotide exchange factor C3G (Baumann et al., 2000; Ribon et al., 1996). Recruitment of C3G results in the activation of the small GTPbinding TC10 (protein product of the RHOQ gene). Activation of TC10 results in cytoskeletal rearrangements that are needed to facilitate Glut4 translocation upon insulin signaling as well as insulinstimulated glucose uptake (Chiang et al., 2001). A recent study of streptozotocininduced diabetic animals showed that Cbl and SORBS1 gene expression was significantly reduced and that the activation of TC10 was also abridged (Gupte and Mora, 2006). In spite of the pivotal role of the CAP/TC10 pathway in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, the association of effector genes with T2DM has not been elucidated well. In the present report, we investigated the genetic var iations of 4 genes encoding major components of the CAP/TC10 pathway-SORBS1, CBL, CRK, and RHOQ and analyzed the association of their genetic variations with T2DM. We studied 1,122 type 2 diabetic cases (586 men and 536 women; age 56.2±8.80 years (mean±SD), BMI 25.4±3.31 kg/m2) and 1,138 nondiabetic controls (516 men and 622 women; age 64.2±2.87 years, BMI 23.7 ±3.7 kg/m2). Diabetic patients were recruited from a Korean prospective community cohort study (Ansung Ansan) according to WHO criteria. Nondiabetic controls had no history of diabetes and had fasting plasma glucose levels less than 6.1 mmol/L and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels less than 5.8%. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Korean National Institute of Health. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The clinical characteristics of subjects are shown in Table 1. We sequenced all exons, including exonintron boundaries, and the promoter region (approximately 1.5 kb) to discover single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 Korean DNA samples using the ABI PRISM 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Twentyeight primer sets for the amplification and sequencing analysis were designed based on sequence information from GenBank. Detailed description about primers is available in Supplementary Table 1. Individual sequence variants were verified on chromatograms. The 10 SNPs were selected for genotyping based on haplotype tagging and minor allele frequency (＞0.5%). SNPs were genotyped using amplifying primers and probes designed for TaqMan (Livak, 1999). The Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) program was used to design both the PCR primers and the MGB TaqMan probes. Information regarding primers and probes is available in Supplementary Table 2. The detailed experimental procedures can be found in Park et al. (2006). To determine whether each individual variant was in equilibrium at each locus in the population (Hardy Weinberg equilibrium), χ2 tests were applied. We examined the linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficient, γ2, between all pairs of biallelic loci (Hedrick and Kumar, 2001). Genotype frequencies were compared between patients and controls in 3 different modes (codominant, dominant, and recessive) by using logistic regression while controlling for age, sex, and BMI. Genotypes were given codes of 0, 1, and 2; 0, 1, and 1; and 0, 0, and 1 in the codominant, dominant, and recessive models, respectively. The SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) was used to perform general statistical analyses. Statistical significance was determined by a two-tailed value of p＜0.05 for logistic regression. To discover genetic variations in the tested genes, we sequenced all exons and their boundaries, including 1.5 kb upstream of the SORBS1, CBL, CRK, and TC10 genes, in the DNA samples of 24 unrelated Koreans. We identified 48 sequence variants (including 23 novel polymorphisms): 15 SNPs in the promoter region (1 SNP in CRK, 8 SNPs in SORBS1, and 6 SNPs in RHOQ), 1 SNP in the 5’ UTR of CBL, 2 synonymous SNPs in coding sequences (1 SNP in CBL and 1 SNP in RHOQ), 23 SNPs in introns (8 SNPs in CBL, 12 SNPs in SORBS1, and 3 SNPs in RHOQ), and 7 SNPs in the 3’ UTR (3 SNPs in CRK and 4 SNPs in SORBS1) (see Supplementary Table 3). The locations of these polymorphisms in relation to the genomic structures of each participant in the CAP/TC10 pathway are described in Supplementary Fig. 1. Next, we selected 10 SNPs for largerscale genotyping based on LDs, position, and frequencies (＞0.05). The SNP positions (marked with asterisks in Supplementary Fig. 1) from the translation start site are 19147C＞T (rs3806202) in the promoter region of SORBS1; 18485G＞T (rs4077664) in intron 1 of SORBS1; +12922C＞A (novel) in SORBS1 exon 13 of the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR); +69002C＞T (rs3794073) in intron 5 of CBL; +71446T＞G (rs2510152) in intron 7 of CBL; +79066C＞T (rs227988) in exon 11 of CBL; 1617C>A (rs1376405), 1601G＞A (rs1868844), and 1510T＞C (rs3754554) in the promoter region of RHOQ; and +751G＞A (novel) in exon 2. No deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium was observed in the genotype frequencies of the 10 SNPs in the 1138 nondiabetic controls. Associations of the 10 SNPs with the risk of T2DM were analyzed using logistic regression, with adjustments for age, sex, and BMI as covariates. The results of the logistic regression analysis are described in Table 2. rs1376405, located in the promoter region of the RHOQ gene, had a risk for diabetes in the recessive mode, with an odds ratio of 8.714 (C. I. 1.714∼44.29) and a pvalue=0.009 in the comparison between nondiabetic controls and cases. Overexpression of the RHOQ gene has been shown to inhibit insulinstimulated GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes (Hou and Pessin, 2007). One hypothesis is that the genetic variation, rs1376405 in the promoter region of RHOQ, affects the expression level of TC10 protein, which in turn influences Glut4 translocation to the plas ma membrane upon the insulin stimulus. As a result, the genetic variation of the RHOQ gene could lead to the increased susceptibility to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Korean population. With further functional studies in row, the rs1376405 SNP in the RHOQ locus could be exploited for the prediction of T2DM in the Korean population.
