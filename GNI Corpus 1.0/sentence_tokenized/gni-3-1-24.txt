Cloning of Xenopus /aev7sTRPV2 by Gene Prediction.

TRPV2    is    a    non-specific    cation    channel    expressed    in

sensory     neurons,     and     activated     by     noxious     heat.

Particularly, TRPV2 has six transmembrane domains and three ankyrin repeats.

TRPV2 has been cloned from

various    species    such    as    human,    rat,    and    mouse.

Oocytes of Xenopus laevis - an African clawed frog - have been widely used for decades in characterization of various receptors and ion channels.

The functional property of rat TRPV2 was also identified by this oocyte expression    system.

However,    no    TRPV2    orthologue    of Xenopus    laevis    has    been    reported    so    far.

Hence,    we have focused to clone a TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus laevis with the aid of bioinformatic tools.

Because the genome sequence of Xenopus laevis is not available until now, a genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis - a close relative species of Xenopus laevis - was used.

After a number of bioinformatic searches in silico, a predicted    full-length    sequence    of    TRPV2    orthologue    of Xenopus tropicalis was found.

Based on this predicted sequence, various approaches such as RT-PCR and 5’-RACE technique were applied to clone a full length of Xenopus laevis TRV2.

Consequently, a full-length Xenopus /aews TRPV2 was cloned from heart cDNA.

Among    the    plethora    of    ion    channels,    transient    receptor potential (TRP) channel family has gained its popularity, as a large amount of TRP channels are involved in physiological     sensory     responses     such     as     thermal, mechanical and chemical sensations (Harteneck eta/., 2000; Koltzenburg, 2004; Montell eta/., 2002a; Montell

et    al.,    2002b).

TRP    channel    was    first    discovered    in Drosophila    melanogaster    (Montell,    1989;    Montell    and Rubin, 1989).

Since its first identification, at least 22 genes were discovered as a member of TRP ion channel family (Clapham eta/., 2003).

TRP family can be divided into a number of sub-families, such as TRPC, TRPM and TRPV.

Among them,    TRPM    sub-family    plays    various    roles    in    cell division,    cell migration, calcium    signaling and    even thermal    sensing (TRPM8) (Fleig    and Penner,    2004; Peier et al., 2002).

TRPV families are relatively well-characterized ion channels in terms of thermosensation.

TRPV1 through TRPV4 channels are known to respond to change in temperature, serving as molecular sensors of heat sensations (Gunthorpe etal., 2002).

TRPV2 (formerly known as VRL1) was cloned from rat dorsal root ganglia (Caterina etal., 1999).

TRPV2 is a non-selective cation channel activated by noxious heat (> 52°C).

Like other TRPV channels, TRPV2 contains six transmembrane domains with a putative pore-loop region between fifth and sixth transmembrane domains and holds three ankyrin repeats at the cytoplasmic amino    terminus,    where    protein-protein    interactions    are supposed to occur (Ferrer-Montiel etal., 2004).

Up until now, a number of TRPV2 orthologues have been cloned from various species such as human, rat, mouse and cow.

An African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, has been the choice of the heterologous expression system for testing cloned ion channels because of the ease of mRNA injection into oocytes.

Still, genetic approach to this frog is not possible to date.

However, the genome project of Xenopus tropicalis, a close relative frog of Xenopus laevis, is under way.

One main reason for the lack of the genome seqeunce of Xenopus laevis is because Xenopus laevis     has     some     drawbacks     compared     to     Xenopus tropicalis-.

Xenopus    laevis    takes    1~2    years    to    reach sexually maturity, whereas Xenopus tropicalis takes 3 or 4 months (Ishii et al., 2004).

Moreover, Xenopus tropicalis has a smaller diploid genome (20 chromosomes) than that of Xenopus laevis (36 chromosomes).

BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of the most widely used similarity search tools in data analysis, which is based on a heuristic method to find the optimal alignments between genes from the highest scoring (Korf, 2003).

BLAST algorithm depends on the


statistics     of     ungapped     sequence     alignment     called maximal    segment    pair    (MSP).

The    mathematical    results of MSP scores generate the statistical    significance    of alignment between selected sequences.

Here in this study, we focused to clone a TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus laevisw\tt\ the aid of bioinformatics tools such as BLAST based on the genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis.

A    Xenopus    tropicalis    protein    sequence    file    (Xenopus

trcp(^/sgenomeassembly2.0, ‘Xerx3pus.040430.proteins.gz’’) was downloaded from Xenbase web site (http;//www.

xenbase.org/ ).

The sequence file was composed of total 116058     computer-predicted     protein sequences.

BLAST program    was downloaded    from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast ) and installed on Linux-based computer.

All sequence data    were    converted    to    support    BLAST    format.

During the BLAST search, default parameters were used.

A human TRPV2 protein sequence is obtained from NCBI Genbank (gi: 8394534).

First-strand cDNA was synthesized from Xenopus laevis heart, brain and oocytes and reverse-transcribed    with SuperScriptTM (Life Technology, Inc.) following     the manufacturer’s protocol.

Based on the predicted Xenopus tropicalis TRPV2 sequence (xtTRPV), primer was designed manually for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

The forward primer was 5’-ATGTCG GGTACAGACTCAGA     TG-3’     (Primer     1)     and     reverse primer was 5’-CTACACCGCTGGGCTGCTT-3’ (Primer 2).

Using these primers, RT-PCR was carried out under following conditions: 94°C X 5 min, 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C X 30 sec, 72°C X 2 min at 30 cycles/ 72°C X 10 min using PCR thermal cycler (TAKARA).

RT-PCR primers of highly-conserved    region    between TRPV2    orthologues    were    designed    as    following:    The forward      primer was      5’-CTACTACCGAGGCCAGAC-3’ (Primer    3) and reverse    primer was 5’-CAGCAGGAGGA TGTAGGTC-3’    (Primer 4).

RT-PCR    was    carried    out    as following conditions: 94°C X 5 min, 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C X 30 sec, 72°C X 1 min 30 sec at 30 cycles/ 72°C X 10 min using PCR thermal cycler (TAKARA).

Based on the conserved 3’-region of Xenopus laevis EST (expressed sequence tag) fragments, a new reverse primer (Primer 5) was designed as 5’-CTACA

CGTCCGGAGTGCT-3’.

These three EST fragments were acquired from NCBI (gi: 14185141,33627140 and 34884469).

RT-PCR    was    performed    under    the    same previous conditions.

First-strand    cDNA    for    5’-RACE    (Rapid-Amplification    of cDNA Ends) of xlTRPV2 was synthesized from Xenopus laevis    heart    with    TAKARA    5’-Full    RACE    Core    set following manufacturer’s protocol (Takara, Osaka, Japan).

In    briefly,    first-strand    cDNA    was    amplified    by    PCR (polymerase chain reaction) in a volume of 15 pH using total RNA 5 //g, 10x RT Buffer, RNase Inhibitor (40units/ pH), AMV Reverse Transcriptase and 5’ end-phosphorylated RT-Primer      5’-ATGCTGCATCCA-3’.

The      amplification program was 30°C X 10 min / 50°C X 60 min / 80°C X 2 min using a thermal cycler (TAKARA).

PCR product was stored at 4°C.

Hybrid RNA from the synthesized first-strand cDNA was selectively degraded by RNase H. 5X Hybrid RNA Degradation     Buffer     and     RNase     H     was     added     in first-strand cDNA, and then incubated at 30 °C for 1 hour.

Following step for ligation reaction (circularization    of single-stranded     cDNA,     or     formation     of     concatemers) was performed by adding the reagents in volume of 40/z£ using 5x RNA (ssDNA) Ligation Buffer, 40% PEG #6000, 1/z£ single-stranded cDNA collected by ethanol precipitation, and 1 pA of T4 RNA Ligase and incubating at 15°C for overnight.

Then, this product was used as a template for 5’RACE PCR and stored at -20°C.

5’RACE PCR was done by 2 step PCR reactions.

Primers were prepared for 1 st PCR reaction.

1 st PCR S1 Primer     was     5’-GACATGTCTGCTGAAGGC-3’     and     1 st PCR A1 Primer was 5’-CTGGTTGCTTTCCATTGCC-3’.

5’RACE template was amplified by PCR using TAKARA LA Tag™ .

The 5’RACE 1 st PCR condition was 94°CX 3 min

/ 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C X 30 sec, 72°C X 2 min at 25 cycles.

The 2 nd PCR template was obtained from product of 1 st PCR.

To assure a clear PCR product, 2 nd PCR templates were prepared by 3 dilutions (no dilution, 10 fold, and 100 fold) of the 1 s ’ PCR product.

The 2 nd PCR primers were also ready for experiment.

2 nd PCR S2 Primer was 5’-CCGATACTGCTGGAAGCT-3’ and 2 nd PCR A2 Primer was 5-CAGGTGAGTAGTCGTCACT-3’.

The 2 nd 5'RACE PCR was also amplified by using

TAKARA LA Taq™.

The 5’RACE 2 nd PCR amplification program was 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C X 30 sec, 72°C X 2 min at 25 cycles.

ClustalW was downloaded from European Bioinformatics


Institute (EMBL-EBI, ftp.ebi.ac.uk/software ) and installed locally on the Linux-based operating system.

Default parameters were used during the process.

Phylogenic tree was made by TreeView 1.6.6 ( http://taxonomy.zoology .

gla.

ac.

u k/rod/treeview.html).

BLASTP search was done to identify a TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus tropicalis among its computer-predicted

116,058 protein sequences.

As a result, the most probable TRPV2 orthologue sequence was found and named as xtTRPV2.

In order to make clear that this xtTRPV2    sequence    was    a    real    orthologue    of    TRPV2, additional BLASTP search was done with xtTRPV2 as a query sequence against NCBI non-redundant (nr) database.

Indeed,    the search result clarified that the xtTRPV2 was a    true TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus tropicalis.

With this predicted full-length xtTRPV2 sequence, custom primers were designed.

RT-PCR was carried out over Xenopus laevis heart, brain and oocyte cDNA.

As shown in Fig.

1, size of the RT-PCR product with Primer 1 and Primer 2 should be around 2,100 base pair long.

However, no PCR product was obtained (Fig.

1A).

Although various temperature conditions of PCR program were attempted    (45,    50, 55 and 60* C as annealing temperatures),     no     apparent bands were detected.

These    results    indicate    that    TRPV2    orthologue of Xenopus laevis is not identical to that of xtTRPV2.

We thus searched a highly-conserved region in Xenopus laevis TRPV2.

To confirm this, new primer pairs     (Primer     3     and     Primer     4)     that     match     to highly-conserved    region    were    constructed    using    multiple alignments    with    xtTRPV2    and    other    TRPV2    orthologs.

RT-PCR with Primer 3 and Primer 4 pairs should amplify the product within a range of 1,100bp through 1,400bp.

Indeed, as depicted in Fig.

1B, a strong PCR band was found in Xenopus laevis heart cDNA.

However, any PCR product was found in the brain and oocytes.

These results show that TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus laevis is present in the heart, but rarely in the brain and oocytes.

We then swapped primers alternatively as shown in Fig.

1.

RT-PCR with Primer 1 and Primer 4 detected a PCR product within a range of 1,700 ~ 2,000 bp (Fig.

1C).

However, RT-PCR with Primer 3 and Primer 2 detected a dim and weak band (Fig.

1D).

These data indicate that Primer 1, not Primer 2, matches to TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus laevis.

Thus, it was concluded that a new 3’ reverse primer is required to clone a full-length TRPV2 orthologue from Xenopus laevis.

Fortunately, 3’-EST fragments of     Xenopus laevis (Genbank Index number 14185141,     33627140 and 34884469) were found    in    BLAST, which facilitated    the designing of a new    3’    reverse primer (Primer    5).

However, this new reverse primer (Primer 5) has a few different    bases    compared    to    Primer    2.

RT-PCR    with Primer 1 and Primer 5 was done against Xenopus laevis heart, brain, and oocytes.

We then found a PCR product with expected size of 2.1 Kb in the heart, but not in the brain and oocytes (Fig.

1E).

After confirmation by sequencing analysis, it was found that this product is conisted of total 2319 nucleotides.

In order to confirm the sequence in the 5’ region, 5’-RACE was carried out as shown in Fig.

2A.

As a result, we confirmed the full length of TRPV2 orthologue from Xenopus    laevis.

As    shown    in    Fig.

2B,    there    were    3 mismatches in the    5’    start    region.

We    named    it    as ‘xlTRPV2’ hereafter.

As represented in Fig.

3, xlTRPV2 sequence was aligned with xtTRPV2.

xtTRPV2 was 2142 base pair long, whereas xlTRPV2 was 2319 base pair long.

Similarity between xlTRPV2 and xtTRPV2 was very high (about     90%),     although     two     regions     were     notably different.

Based on the x!TRPV2 DNA sequence,    xlTRPV2 protein sequence was obtained by translation    in silico (Fig.

4).

It is composed of 773 amino acids and holds six transmembrane domains and three ankyrin    repeats    at N-terminal.

This indicates that xlTRPV2     shares     a common characteristic of    other    TRPV2    in    terms    of predicted protein topologies.

To compare the similarity between xlTRPV2 and other TRPV2 orthologues, multiple alignment was done by ClustalW (Fig.

5A) (Li, 2003).

xlTRPV2 has 50%


homology with human TRPV2.

Using the result obtained from multiple alignments, phylogenetic tree was made by TreeView program (Fig.

5B) (Page, 1996).

TRPV2 is heat-sensitive, non-selective cation channel found in various species including mammals.

Even though mammalian TRPV2 is known, the presence of a TRPV2 orthologue in Xenopus laevis is not known even though frequent use of the amphibian oocytes as heterologous expression system.

We thus cloned and identified a full length of TRPV2 orthologue in Xenopus laevis.

\Ne initially tried to clone xlTRPV2 using the sequence of xtTRPV2.

But, RT-PCR with Primer 1-2 pairs that were based on the orthologue of Xenopus tropicalis was unable to detect any product from selected tissues under various PCR conditions.

This result was rather anticipated because there was a species difference between the predicted sequence which was xtTRPV2 and the source of PCR template DNA (Xenopus laevis).

In addition, the reason for the RT-PCR failure would stem from an imperfect prediction of the full genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis, which is often the case in prediction of exons in sitico.

In summary, a full sequence of TRPV2 orthologue of

Xenopus    laevis    was    identified.

Yet,    further    experiments are required to characterize the function of x!TRPV2.
