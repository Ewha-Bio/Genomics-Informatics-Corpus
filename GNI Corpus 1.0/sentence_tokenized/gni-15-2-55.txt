Title: Editor's Introduction to This Issue (G&I 15:2, 2017)

In this issue, Dr. Jong-Il Kim's group (Seoul National University, Korea) reports gene expression profile data in human dermal fibroblasts treated with COX inhibitors.

Some COX2-selective inhibitors inhibit cellular senescence, but other COX2-selective inhibitors and COX2 nonselective inhibitors accelerate senescence and aging.

The authors tried to figure out the underlying mechanisms by which COX inhibitors modulate senescence in the skin.

Dr. Yeun-Jun Chung's group (The Catholic University of Korea) suggests that a variant in RUNX3 is associated with the risk of ankylosing spondylitis in Koreans.

Dr. Mana Oloomi's group (Pasteur Institute of Iran) demonstrates a sporadic phylogenic pattern in cytolethal distending toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains.
