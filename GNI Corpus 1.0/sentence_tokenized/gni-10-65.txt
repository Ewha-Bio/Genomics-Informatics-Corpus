To explore the details of the variants easily in related stud-ies, we built a database, cataloging the CNVs and re-lated information. This system helps researchers brows-ing these variants with gene and structure variant annotations. Users can easily find specific regions with search options and verify them from system-integrated genome browsers with annotations.Keywords: copy number variation, database, genome browserAvailability: The East Asian CNV database (EACDB) can be accessed at www.ircgp.com/EACNVDB.html.

IntroductionCopy number variation (CNV) is a common type of structural variation in the human genome. They have been suggested to be related to disease susceptibility or human phenotype diversity [1-3]. Current genome-wide association studies of CNVs are attempting to find how they are related to disease susceptibility or pheno-typic diversity. Due to the fact that frequencies of CNVs show ethnic differences [4-7], a finding of disease or phenotype association of a specific CNV in one pop-ulation is hard to generalize to other populations. How-ever, by comparing the frequencies of target CNVs among different ethnic groups, we could assume the population-specific disease susceptibility or phenotype difference.   In this regard, CNV frequency information of various populations has become a major concern of population or disease association studies.   With increasing interest in CNVs, many CNV projects have been announced recently. Many of them have al-ready established large databases of CNVs from many different ethnic groups (Database of Genomic Variants [DGV], http://projects.tcag.ca; The Copy Number Vari-ants Projects, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/areas/ humangenetics/cnv/) [8]. There are also several data-bases for supporting population-specific studies, includ-ing the CNV Control Database for Japanese (http:// gwas.lifesciencedb.jp), the Singapore Human Mutation and Polymorphism Database (shmed.bii.a-star.edu.sg) [9], and the Thailand Mutation and Variation Database (www4a.biotec.or.th) [10]. The accumulation of CNV in-formation seems promising, in that we can gradually ex-tend the knowledge of CNVs everywhere in the world. However, it will take a long time to fill the gap of CNV databases covering the whole population.      As a step to fill this gap, we discovered a Korean CNV with Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a previous study [11]. In this study, we built a Korean database based on the findings of 4,003 copy number variation regions (CNVRs). To build a tool that is easily accessible via the web for Korean-specific CNV studies, we built a viewer for browsing these CNVs. Features and Results
