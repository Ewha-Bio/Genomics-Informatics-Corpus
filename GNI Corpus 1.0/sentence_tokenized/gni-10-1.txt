The application to genome study has been particularly developed with the introduction of the next- generation DNA sequencer (NGS) Roche/454 and Illumina/ Solexa systems, along with bioinformation analysis tech-nologies of whole-genome de novo assembly, expression profiling, DNA variation discovery, and genotyping. Both massive whole-genome shotgun paired-end sequencing and mate paired-end sequencing data are important steps for constructing de novo assembly of novel ge-nome sequencing data. It is necessary to have DNA se-quence information from a multiplatform NGS with at least 2× and 30× depth sequence of genome coverage using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, for effective an way of de novo assembly. Massive short- length reading data from the Illumina/Solexa system is enough to discover DNA variation, resulting in reducing the cost of DNA sequencing. Whole-genome expression profile data are useful to approach genome system bio-logy with quantification of expressed RNAs from a whole- genome transcriptome, depending on the tissue sam-ples. The hybrid mRNA sequences from Rohce/454 and Illumina/Solexa are more powerful to find novel genes through de novo assembly in any whole-genome se-quenced species. The 20× and 50× coverage of the estimated transcriptome sequences using Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa, respectively, is effective to create novel expressed reference sequences. However, only an average 30× coverage of a transcriptome with short read sequences of Illumina/Solexa is enough to check expression quantification, compared to the reference ex-pressed sequence tag sequence.

Also, scientists hope to dramati-cally reduce the cost of reading genomic DNA and to obtain the high-throughput DNA sequence information. Since the automated DNA sequencers were developed with fluorescent dyes of different colors, laser, and com-puter technology in the 1980s, the human genome proj-ect (HGP) was begun in 1990, and the human genome was completely released in 2003, while further analysis is still being published. A total of about 3 billion dollars was invested to the project. In 1991, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) funds were geared toward lowering the cost of DNA sequencing. Some of technologies invested improved the DNA sequencing. To date, the Applied Biosystems, Roche/454, and Illumina/ Solexa have successfully developed their technology and applied DNA sequencing in the world during the re-cent 6 years. Most of the newest technologies currently in use generate sequences from 36 to 1,000 base pairs, which requires special software for different applications, including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptome ana-lysis, and regulatory gene analysis. In particular, in silico method development using bioinformation software for next-generation sequence assembly would be alert for many genome projects and more applications in genome biology. Particularly, many biologists and geneticists us-ing massive DNA and RNA sequences have used the sequencing applications focused on the variable research fields in medicine, such as improved diagnosis of dis-ease; gene therapy; control systems for drugs, including
