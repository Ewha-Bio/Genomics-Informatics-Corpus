WinBioDBs: A Windows-based Integrated Program for Manipulating Major Biological Databases.

We have developed WinBioDBs with Windows interfaces, which include importing modules and searching interfaces for 10 major public databases such as GenBank, PIR, SwissProt, Pathway, EPD, ENZYME, REBASE, Prosite, Blocks, and Pfam.

User databases can be constructed with searching results of queries and their entries can be edited.

The program is a stand-alone database searching program on Windows PC.

Database update features are supported by importing raw database files and indexing after downloading them.

Users can adjust their own searching environments and report format and construct their own projects consisting of a combination of a local databases.

WinBioDBs are implemented with VC++ and its database is based on MySQL.

Many biological databases are supported in commercial softwares or via web interfaces.

Entrez and SRS, which are provided with web interfaces, are known as the most popular and powerful programs for this purpose.

While users usually need to save searched results, most programs do not support the features.

We have developed a Windows program, WinBioDBs, which provides searching 10 major databases, GenBank (Benson, 2004), PIR (Barker, 2000), SwissProt (Bairoch, 2004), KEGG Pathway (Kanehisa, 2002), EPD (Schmid, 2006), Enzyme (Bairch, 2000), REBASE (Roberts, 2007), Prosite (Hulo, 2004), BLOCKS (Henikoff, 2000), Pfam (Bateman, 2004) and supports local database features for saving and searching the searched results.

Users can import and update the major databases with Windows interfaces and can manipulate their own local databases with searched results.

The detailed features of WinBioDBs are as follows.

ㆍWindows program   ㆍsupporting the search of 10 major biological databases (Table 1) including large databases like GenBank  ㆍsearching and formatting the results  ㆍlocal databases for the searched results  ㆍediting and searching local databases  ㆍcustomization of search conditions for each database  ㆍcustomization of output fields for each database  ㆍproject features  multiple local databases  ㆍupdating public DB  ㆍbackup of local databases  The database schema of WinBioDBs is a little complicated (Fig.

1) to support the complicated features (Fig.

2).

Database information table is a meta table and each of 10 major public databases constructs a public DB table and a private DB table.

WinBioDB is a Windows program with diverse and      unique features as a PC-based program.

With more practical requirements through user tests, it will be upgraded to a more useful database program.

It could include more public databases and could be integrated with analysis programs.

As WinBioDBs use MySQL as its database engine, the server version programs can be easily constructed by just changing the database server while using its Windows interfaces.,
