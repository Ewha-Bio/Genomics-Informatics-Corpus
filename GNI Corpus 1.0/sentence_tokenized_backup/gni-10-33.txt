The main hurdle in cancer genomics is to identify the real causative mutations or genes out of many candidates from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis. One useful approach is to refer to known can-cer genes and associated information. The list of known cancer genes can be used to determine candidates of cancer driver mutations, while cancer gene-related in-formation, including gene expression, protein-protein in-teraction, and pathways, can be useful for scoring novel candidates. Some cancer gene or mutation databases exist for this purpose, but few specialized tools exist for an automated analysis of a long gene list from an HGT-based cancer genomic analysis. This report pres-ents a new web-accessible bioinformatic tool, called CaGe, a cancer genome annotation system for the as-sessment of candidates of cancer genes from HGT- based cancer genomics. The tool provides users with information on cancer-related genes, mutations, path-ways, and associated annotations through annotation and browsing functions. With this tool, researchers can classify their candidate genes from cancer genome studies into either previously reported or novel catego-ries of cancer genes and gain insight into underlying carcinogenic mechanisms through a pathway analysis. We show the usefulness of CaGe by assessing its per-formance in annotating somatic mutations from a pub-lished small cell lung cancer study.

Especially, the applications of NGS include whole-genome, exome, and transcriptome approaches for searching for a wide range of cancer-specific geno-mic alterations, such as point mutations, insertions, and deletions; copy number changes; and rearrangements, leading to the development of cancer [1].   One of the hurdles in HGT-based cancer genomics is to identify causative mutations or genes out of many candidates from the analysis. A useful approach is to refer to known cancer genes and associated information [2]. The list of known cancer genes can be used to de-termine candidates of cancer driver mutations, while cancer gene-related information, such as gene expres-sion, protein-protein interaction, and pathway informa-tion, can be useful for scoring novel candidates.   Some useful cancer genomic databases for this pur-pose exist, including Cancer Gene Census (CGC) [3] and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) [4], which have been constructed and managed by the Cancer Genome Project of the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute; and Cancer Gene Index (CGI, http://ncicb.nci. nih.gov/NCICB/projects/cgdcp), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov), and Cancer Ge-nome Anatomy Project (CGAP, http://cgap.nci.nih.gov), which are maintained by the National Cancer Institute of the U. S. National Institute of Health and National Hu-man Genome Research Institute. Among them, COSMIC and CGC are the two most commonly used resources among researchers when checking reported cancer driv-er mutations. The COSMIC database stores information on somatic mutations and associated information ex-tracted from the scientific literature, while the CGC da
