The Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPgen) and Cohorts for Heart and Aging Re-search in Genome Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortiums identified 14 loci that govern blood pressure on a ge-nomewide significance level, one of which is CASZ1 confirmed in both Europeans and Asians. CASZ1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that controls apoptosis and cell fate and suppresses neuroblastoma tumor growth by reprogramming gene expression, like a tumor suppressor. To validate the function of CASZ1 in blood pressure, we decreased Casz1 mRNA levels in mice by siRNA. Casz1 siRNA reduced mRNA levels by 59% in a mouse cell line. A polyethylenimine-mixed siRNA com-plex was injected into mouse tail veins, reducing Casz1 mRNA expression to 45% in the kidney. However, blood pressure in the treated mice was unaffected, despite a 55% reduction in Casz1 mRNA levels in the kidney on multiple siRNA injections daily. Even though Casz1 siRNA-treated mice did not experience any significant change in blood pressure, our study demonstrates the value of in vivo siRNA injection in analyzing the function of candidate genes identified by genomewide associa-tion studies.Keywords: association analysis, blood pressure, CASZ1, expressionIntroductionCASZ1 gene is a zinc finger transcription factor that controls cell fate, although little is known about its func-tion [1]. CASZ1 is also known as a survival-related gene  that has 2 isoforms. It encodes a putative protein of 172 amino acids that localizes predominantly in the peri-nuclear region, as predicted for transcription factors. CASZ1 is highly expressed in many human cancer cell lines, although its expression is low in most tissues, im-plicating it in tumor growth [2].  These findings indicate that CASZ1 is important for cell proliferation, development, and differentiation, as well as carcinogenesis. However, CASZ1 has recently been reported to be significantly associated with blood pressure and hypertension in genomewide association studies (GWASs) [3]. Blood pressure GWASs by the Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPgen) [4] and the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genome Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium [5] have identified 14 independent loci that govern blood pressure or hy-pertension at a genomewide significance level, 7 of which were replicated in the Japanese population (CASZ1, MTHFR, ITGA9, FGF5, CYP17A1-CNNM2, ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3) [6].   Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs880315, which lies in an intron of CASZ1, was one of the 7 repli-cate loci (p = 2.2 × 10-8, p = 4.9 × 10-12, and p = 3.0 × 10-7 for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pres-sure, and hypertension, respectively). CASZ1 was also linked to blood pressure in the Women’s Genome Health Study (rs880315; p = 5.2 × 10-9 for systolic blood pressure) [7]. Recently, the CASZ1 locus was identified in 19,608 subjects of east Asian ancestry by the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network Blood Pressure (AGEN-BP) consortium [8].  Although these blood pressure GWASs have sug-gested that these loci control blood pressure, their func-tion in blood pressure has not been examined. Tradi-tionally, knockout or transgenic mice have been used to reveal gene function and can be good approaches for examining candidate genes that lie near the GWAS loci [9]. However, this process is expensive and time-con-suming [10], requiring technical advances to determine their function in vivo.  Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is an alternative ap-proach that has the potential to become the preferred tool for that purpose [11]. In vivo injection of siRNA re-duces gene expression by 70% to 80% in certain tis-sues in mice, demonstrating its efficacy [12].  However, specific tissues can not be targeted by in vivo injection of siRNA, and the injected siRNA is un-stable in blood serum, limiting their use in delivering siRNA in vivo. It also has certain disadvantages, such
