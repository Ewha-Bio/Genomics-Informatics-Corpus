Most studies include insufficient samples to apply statistical methods for detecting significant gene sets. This study combined two small microarray datasets from a public database and identified significant genes associated with the progress of oral squamous cell carcinoma. There were different expression scales between the two datasets, even though these datasets were generated under the same platforms - Affymetrix U133A gene chips. We discretized gene expressions of the two data-sets by adjusting the differences between the datasets for detecting the more reliable information. From the combination of the two datasets, we detected 51 signifi-cant genes that were upregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Most of them were published in previous studies as cancer-related genes. From these selected genes, significant genetic pathways associated with ex-pression changes were identified. By combining several datasets from the public database, sufficient samples can be obtained for detecting reliable information. Most of the selected genes were known as cancer-related genes, including oral squamous cell carcinoma. Several unknown genes can be biologically evaluated in further studies.Keywords: combined dataset, genetic pathway, oral squamous cell carcinoma, public microarray database, significant geneIntroductionDespite recent advances in surgical, radiation, and che-motherapeutic treatment protocols, the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains mournful, with an approximate 50% 5-year mortality rate from disease or associated complications [1]. Therefore, the identi-fication of biological markers is essential to make prog-ress in detecting malignancy at an early stage and de-veloping novel therapies [2].  Microarray datasets that are created for the same re-search purposes in different laboratories have accumu-lated rapidly. The results from different datasets are of-ten inconsistent due to the utilization of different plat-forms, sample preparations, or various technical varia-tions. If we could combine such datasets by adjusting for systematic biases that exist among different datasets derived from different experimental conditions, the pow-er of statistical tests would be improved by the increase in sample size [3].   In OSCC, although lots of microarray-based studies have been conducted to provide insights into gene ex-pression changes, most of these studies have contained insufficient samples for detecting reliable information us-ing statistical analysis [4, 5]. Therefore, this study at-tempted to combine several datasets in the public data-base for detecting significant genes.  We used two small microarray datasets of OSCC for this study, which were based on the same platform but had different expression scales. These two datasets were combined after discretization, because a previous study showed that classification could be improved us-ing combined datasets after discretization [3]. After combining datasets, we used chi-square test for identi-fying the significant genes. Chi-square test has been used commonly to detect differentially expressed genes after discretization of expression intensities in the micro-array experiment.  In this study, gene expression ratios of two datasets were transformed with their ranks for each dataset. Next, the transformed datasets were combined, and a nonparametric statistical method was applied to the combined dataset to detect informative genes. Finally, we showed that most of the selected genes were known to be involved in various cancers, including OSCC
