Using two model plant (rice and Arabidopsis) genomes, we compared two well-known intron prediction tools: the Blast-Like Align-ment Tool (BLAT) and Sim4cc. The results showed that each of the tools had its own advantages and disadvan-tages. BLAT predicted more than 99% introns of whole genomic introns with a small number of false-positive introns. Sim4cc was successful at finding the correct in-trons with a false-negative rate of 1.02% to 4.85%, and it needed a longer run time than BLAT. Further, we evaluated the intron information of 10 complete plant genomes. As non-coding sequences, intron lengths are not limited by a triplet codon frame; so, intron lengths have three phases: a multiple of three bases (3n), a multiple of three bases plus one (3n + 1), and a multiple of three bases plus two (3n + 2). It was widely accepted that the percentages of the 3n, 3n + 1, and 3n + 2 in-trons were quite similar in genomes. Our studies showed that 80% (8/10) of species were similar in terms of the number of three phases. The percentages of 3n introns in Ostreococcus lucimarinus was excessive (47.7%), while in Ostreococcus tauri, it was deficient (29.1%). This discrepancy could have been the result of errors in intron prediction. It is suggested that a three-phase evaluation is a fast and effective method of detecting in-tron annotation problems.Keywords: intron length distributions, intron prediction, plant, three phasesIntroductionWith more and more species’ genomes completely se-quenced, noncoding sequences have become a focus of researchers’ attention, especially for the study of introns. In order to facilitate further research, a number of intron databases have been developed (Table 1). The number of plant intron databases is much smaller than that in mammals and only in several model plants (such as Arabidopsis and rice). Using known genome sequences and coding sequences (expressed sequence tags [ESTs] or cDNA), introns can be detected by aligning coding sequences with genome sequences. Many tools were developed to detect introns in eukaryotes (Table 2) [1-16]. These tools used different algorithms and com-puter languages (such as Java, C++, and Python) to predict introns.   Therefore, the question is: there are many intron data-bases, algorithms, and detection methods for the study of eukaryotes, but which among them are the most suit-able for the detection of plant introns? Among these tools, the Blast-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) and Sim4cc are the most commonly used tools. BLAT applies in ge-nomewide alignment [11]. Sim4cc is a tool for aligning cDNA and genomic sequences between species at vari-ous evolutionary distances [2]. Rice and Arabidopsis, as monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous model plants, are widespread with regard to in-depth research. Their ge-nome sequences have been annotated in detail, includ-ing their gene sequences, complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences, coding DNA sequence (CDS) sequences, exon sequences, intron sequences, and intergene sequences. Therefore, it is possible to use this model plant infor-mation to test these intron prediction tools.  Genome annotation is a difficult and accurate project- even the best-annotated or most carefully studied ge-nomes are continually re-released; e.g., release 7 of the Rice Genome Annotation Project was available on Octo-ber 31, 2011 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/). But, de-termining the accuracy and detecting the inherent errors of the genome annotation is a problem. Since introns are removed from protein-coding transcripts, intron lengths are not expected to respect coding frames across the genome [17]. Using intron length distributions, Roy and Penny [18] point out a rapid and simple method for de
