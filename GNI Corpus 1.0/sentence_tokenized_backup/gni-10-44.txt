So far, in most approaches, the number of occurrences is a major measure of determining whether a pattern is interesting or not. In computational biology, however, a pattern that is not frequent may still be considered very informative if its actual support frequency exceeds the prior expect-ation by a large margin. In this paper, we propose a new interesting measure that can provide meaningful bi-ological information. We also propose an efficient in-dex-based method for mining such interesting patterns. Experimental results show that our approach can find interesting patterns within an acceptable computation time.Keywords: DNA sequence, index-based method, in-formation gain, pattern miningIntroductionBiological sequences, such as DNA sequences, have a great number of contiguous patterns consisting of fre-quent items. Which patterns are interesting to biolo-gists? Is a pattern that occurs more frequently more in-teresting? So far, in most approaches, the number of occurrences has been a major measure of determining an interesting pattern. This measure, however, is not enough to discriminate a pattern from the background noise and may induce much time to spend for checking patterns of no biological meaning. Researchers are more interested in contiguous patterns that are statistically significant than those simply occurring frequently. The aim of mining interesting patterns is to analyze the im-portant biological functions hidden in the extremely large amounts of genomic sequences. In this work, we aimed to discover surprising contiguous patterns that occur at a frequency higher than their expected fre-quencies. To find such surprising patterns with con-fidence, we chose to use a more suitable measure, in-formation [1], which is widely studied and used in the field of communication. In information theory, if a pat-tern is expected to occur frequently based on some pri-or knowledge or by chance, then an occurrence of that pattern carries less information. Thus, we can use in-formation to test the surprise of an occurrence of a pattern. The information gain is introduced to denote the accumulated information of a pattern in a DNA se-quence and is used to exhibit the degree of surprise of the pattern.  Many works for sequential pattern mining take an a priori approach, such as Agrawal and Srikant [2], who used downward closure property to prune infrequent patterns, which says that if a pattern is infrequent, all of its superpatterns must be infrequent. It suffers from the level-wise difficulty for candidate generation-and-test and needs several database scans for sequential pattern mining. A typical Apriori-like approach such as Genera-lized Sequential Patterns (GSP) [3] is a good example of this category. An efficient algorithm, PrefixSpan [4], has been proposed, representing projection-based sequential pattern mining. This approach examines only the prefix subsequences and projects only their corresponding postfix subsequences into the databases. Sequential patterns are grown by exploring  length-1 frequent pat-terns in each projected database. Using the projected database, however, every expansion of sequential pat-terns needs a recursive process, which is not effective for DNA sequence mining. The problem of finding the frequent maximal contiguous pattern from sequences more than two has been introduced in [5-8]. In addition, Yang et al. [9] have proposed an interesting technique to find periodic patterns in a sequence of events. Lu et al. [10] have proposed a pattern discovery algorithm that can identify over-represented patterns inside DNA sequences by introducing a new measurement system.  Another efficient algorithm, MacosVSpan [11], has been proposed, which gets the maximal subsequence of each data item by fixed-length spanning and finally looks for frequent maximal contiguous patterns using a
