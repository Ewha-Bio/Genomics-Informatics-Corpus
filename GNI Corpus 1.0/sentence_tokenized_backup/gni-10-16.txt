The proteins encoded by the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, mutations in which account for nearly all cases of ADPKD, may help guard against cystogenesis. Previously developed mouse models of PKD1 and PKD2 demon-strated an embryonic lethal phenotype and massive cyst formation in the kidney, indicating that PKD1 and PKD2 probably play important roles during normal renal tubu-lar development. However, their precise role in develop-ment and the cellular mechanisms of cyst formation in-duced by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations are not fully under-stood. To address this question, we presently created Pkd2 knockout and PKD2 transgenic mouse embryo fibroblasts. We used a mouse oligonucleotide microarray to identify messenger RNAs whose expression was al-tered by the overexpression of the PKD2 or knockout of the Pkd2. The majority of identified mutations was in-volved in critical biological processes, such as metabo-lism, transcription, cell adhesion, cell cycle, and signal transduction. Herein, we confirmed differential expres-sions of several genes including aquaporin-1, according to different PKD2 expression levels in ADPKD mouse models, through microarray analysis. These data may be helpful in PKD2-related mechanisms of ADPKD patho-genesis. Keywords: cystogenesis, MEF cells, microarray, PKD2, polycystic kidney disease IntroductionAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenetic disorder, affecting as many as 1 in 500 people in the general population. The dis-ease is characterized by the formation of multiple flu-id-filled renal cysts that expand over time and destroy the architecture of the kidney. Five percent of all cases of chronic renal failure are due to ADPKD, and approx-imately 50% of ADPKD patients will develop end-stage renal disease by the time they are 60 years of age [1].  In the early stages of ADPKD, numerous cysts begin to enlarge from many segments of the kidney. Later, the enlarged regions disassociate from the original nephron to form the actual cysts, which continue to enlarge due to proliferation of epithelial cells and fluid secretion into the cyst lumen. Progressive renal cyst formation and en-largement result in a loss of renal function and hyper-tension and culminate in renal failure. It is generally be-lieved that cysts enlarge by means of abnormal cell growth, forming what is essentially a fluid-filled tumor that fills by transepithelial fluid secretion. Cyst enlarge-ment may then lead to extracellular matrix remodeling, interstitial fibrosis, a general inflammatory response, and disruption of the normal renal parenchyma, which then interfere with glomerular filtration and vascular blood flow, giving rise to cell death by apoptosis and ulti-mately renal failure [2].  Many studies have indicated that most cases of ADPKD are accounted for by mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, encoding the transmembrane protein polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. Mice with targeted mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes develop cystic kidneys during embryogenesis, and ADPKD in humans is associated with mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes [3, 4]. In addition, the product of the PKD1 gene, PC1, has been implicated in a variety of pathways tied to proliferation, including G-protein sig-naling and the Wnt, activator protein 1 (AP-1), and Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of tran-scription cascades [5, 6]. Moreover, depletion of PC1 has been shown to increase cell growth, whereas its overexpression slows cell growth, indicating that PC1 may negatively regulate cell proliferation [7, 8]. PC2, the protein product of PKD2, has also been implicated in cell cycle regulation via its calcium channel activity and stimulation of AP-1 [9, 10]; however, there has been lit-tle direct evidence tying PC2 to this process
