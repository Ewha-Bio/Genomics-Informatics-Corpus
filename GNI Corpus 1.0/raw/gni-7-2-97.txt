High-concentration Epigallocatechin Gallate Treatment Causes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-mediated Cell Death in HepG2 Cells.

  Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a wellknown antioxidant molecule, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity when used in excess.  However, the mechanism underlying EGCG-induced hepatotoxicity is still unclear.  To better understand the mode of action of EGCG-induced hepatotoxicity, we examined the effect of EGCG on human hepatic gene expression in HepG2 cells using microarrays.  Analyses of microarray data revealed more than 1300 differentially expressed genes with a variety of biological processes.  Upregulated genes showed a primary involvement with proteinrelated biological processes, such as protein synthesis, protein modification, and protein trafficking, while downregulated genes demonstrated a strong association with lipid transport.  Genes involved in cellular stress responses were highly upregulated by EGCG treatment, in particular genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, such as GADD153, GADD34, and ATF3.  In addition, changes in genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis and lipid transport were also observed, which explains the high accumulation of EGCGinduced lipids.  We also identified other regulatory genes that might aid in clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying EGCG-induced hepatotoxicity.        Green tea is a traditional Asian beverage made from the leaves of Camellia sinensis and contains several polyphenolic components, such as catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG).   In addition to its prominent role as a common beverage, green tea has demonstrated profound biochemical and pharmacological activities, including antioxidative activities and antiinflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties (Isbrucker et al., 2006).  The beneficial effects of green tea on health have been backed by multiple scientific reports, which have proposed the involvement of green tea in various biological processes, such as inhibition of: telomerase, mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), activator protein1, nuclear factor (NF)kB, binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptor, angiogenesis, and activation of apoptosis (Vittal et al., 2004).   However, it is becoming more apparent that green tea compounds might also cause deleterious effects at pharmacological concentrations in certain cases (Lambert et al., 2007).  For example, in France and Spain, cases of hepatic attack have been reported after the use of hydroalcoholic extracts of green tea as a complement of diets.  These observations have led to the suspension of marketing authorization of these products in both countries.  In animal models, EGCG causes a high mortality rate in adult female Swiss Webster mice and hepatotoxicity in immature C57BL/6 female mice (Galati et al., 2006; Goodin and Rosengren, 2003).  Additionally, recent studies have shown that several phenolic antioxidant food additives can accelerate oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and carbohydrates, despite their antioxidative action.  The molecular mechanism of prooxidative action and hepatotoxicity that are induced by EGCG remains poorly understood.  Galati et al.  (2006) reported that cell death induced by EGCG was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and catecholomethyltransferase (COMT).  The mechanism of EGCGinduced cell death was suggested in previous reports, which implicated the apoptosis pathway (Schmidt et al.  2005) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stressrelated pathway (Dodo et al., 2008).    To gain insight into the molecular mechanism underlying EGCGinduced cytotoxicity, we used a microarray approach, which allowed us to observe the global effects of EGCG on hepatic gene expression.  Time course   observations of the gene expression profile were made.  We propose in the present study that hepatic cell death resulting from high-concentration EGCG treatment is mainly caused by ER stress. EGCG was purchased from Sigma (St.  Louis, MO, USA).  DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, TRIzol, and DEPC-treated water were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The HepG2 cell line was cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in a monolayer culture at 37oC in an incubator of humidified air with 5% CO2.  Subconfluent cells (80%) were passaged with a solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. HepG2 cells were treated with test substances dissolved in 10% DMSO for 24 h.  After the treatment, cell viability was assessed using the resazurin assay (CellTiter BlueⓇ, Promega, Madison, WI, USA).  Cells were incubated with medium containing resazurin.  A kinetic assay of resorufin, produced from resazurin by vital cells, was performed by measuring its absorbance (570 nm) in a SpectraMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).  The absorbance at 600 nm was used as reference. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol at each time point in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedures.  RNA quantification and purity (260/280 ratio) were determined with a UV/VIS spectrophotometer (ND-1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA).   The Applied Biosystems Human Genome Survey Arrays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), which contain 60-mer oligonucleotide probes representing a set of 32,878 individual mouse genes and more than 250 control probes, were used for differential gene expression profiles.  Microarray experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Digoxigenin (DIG)-UTP-labeled cRNA was generated from 5 μg of total RNA and amplified using a chemiluminescent reverse transcription (RT) in vitro transcription labeling kit (Applied Biosystems).  Briefly, each microarray was prehybridized in hybridization buffer with blocking reagent at 55oC for 1 h.  DIGlabeled cRNA targets (10μg) were fragmented to 100?400 bp and hybridized with each prehybridized microarray at 55oC for 16 h.  The arrays were washed with hybridization wash buffer and then with chemiluminescence rinse buffer.  Chemiluminescent signals were generated by incubating the arrays with antiDIGalkaline phosphatase and chemiluminescence substrate.  Images were collected for each microarray using the 1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).  Microarray images were autogridded, and the chemiluminescent signals were quantified, corrected for background, spatially normalized, and exported for a quality report.  Microarray data with quality reports above the manufacturer's threshold were used for further analysis. Signal intensities were imported into GenPlex software (Istech Inc, Korea), where interarray quantile normalization was performed in order to minimize the effect of external variables introduced into the data.  Quality filtering of unreliable spots (flag value＜100 and S/N＜3) was performed before normalization.  Then, the expression intensities were log2transformed.  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected by oneway ANOVA, and correction for multiple testing was then performed using BenjaminiHochberg multiple testing to derive a false discovery rate estimate from the raw pvalues.  A false discovery rate of 1% was used as a cutoff for statistical significance.  We took the average value from the gene expression ratio obtained in 3 or more biological replicates.   For further analysis, DEGs were divided into gene clusters according to expression level at each time point.  Hierarchical clustering was applied to genes using Euclidean distance as a similarity measurement, as implemented in the Genesis software program (http:// genome. tugraz. at).  Additionally, DEGs were divided into categories according to biological process using the PANTHER (Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) Protein Classification System (Applied Biosystems, https://panther. appliedbiosystems. com). For semiquantitative and realtime quantitative RTPCR, glyceraldehydes3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control with the 5’ ccatcatgaagtgtgacgttg 3’ and 5’ gtgctaggagccagagcagta 3’   primer set.  For each sample, the same total RNA used for microarray hybridization was reversetranscribed using 1μM oligo (dT) primer with Superscript Ⅲ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).  The thermal profiles consisted of 94oC for 5 min for initial denaturing, followed by 25∼35 cycles of 94oC for 30 s, 55∼65oC for 30 s, and 72oC for 30 s to 1 min.  All RT-PCR reactions were repeated at least 3 times.  Triplicate real-time RTPCR experiments were performed using the MiniOpticon system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and the DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).  A melting curve was obtained for each PCR product after each run to confirm that the signal corresponded to a unique amplicon of the product size.  The primers were 5’ gaa gtg agt gct tct gcc atc -3’ and 5’- act ttc cag ctt ctc cga ctc-3’ for activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3); 5’- ttt cca gac tga tcc aac tgc -3’ and 5’ acc act ctg ttt ccg ttt cct g -3’ for DNA damage-inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3/GADD153/CHOP); 5’- gat gaa gag gag ggt gag gtc -3’ and 5’- aca cct gta gca gga gtg gaa g 3’ for protein phosphatase, regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A/GADD34); 5’- cca tac gga gaa acc aga aca -3’ and 5’- ggt ggc ctt cgt act tct ctt g 3’ for seven in absentia homolog 2 (SIAH2); 5’- gct ggt acc cag ctc ctc tac -3’ and 5’- gtt ctc cag cac cag ctt ctt c 3’ for tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3); 5’- tca gtc acg ggt gag cag tat g -3’ and 5’- caa agt ctc tgc caa gag tgg 3’ for stromal cell-derived factor 2-like 1 (SDF2L1); 5’ cct tgt tcc aga gca gat gtc -3’ and 5’- att cca cca aaa act gca cac 3’ for choroideremialike (CHML); and 5’ tca gct ttt tcc aga gat cca g 3’ and 5’ cta tcc tgt cga ctt gct tgg 3’ for YKT6 vSNARE homolog (YKT6).   All experiments were carried out 3 times.  Results are presented as mean values±SE.  The effect of EGCG on HepG2 viability was monitored by resazurin assay, which measures the reducing capacity of mitochondria in cells.  Based on the cell viability assay results, it seemed that the treatment of EGCG at low concentrations (10-100 uM) increased the viability of the cells but not at higher concentrations (10003500 uM).  At higher concentrations, rather, EGCG caused a significant decrease in cell viability (Fig.  1).  The lethal concentration 30 (LC30) of EGCG against HepG2 cells was determined as 850 uM, according to nonlinear regression analysis.  EGCC at 850 uM was used for the following experiments. Gene expression profiling was performed to examine the temporal changes of gene expression in EGCGtreated HepG2 cells.  Total RNA was prepared from the cells treated with 850 uM of EGCG for 6, 12, 24 h, and 0 h   (the control).  The cRNAs were subsequently synthesized and hybridized.  Analyses revealed that EGCG treatment significantly (p＜0.01) altered the expression of 1343 genes (http://kotis. nifds. go. kr).  Interestingly, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and Nmyc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) showed marked overexpression (more than 5-fold), while inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) revealed a drastic downregulation (more than 10-fold) by EGCG treatment at all 3 time points.  To characterize patterns of transcript expression during the time course, hierarchical clustering was performed on the 1343 genes, and these genes were classified into 4 clusters (Fig.  2A).  The temporal cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters of transcripts that were either downregulated (cluster 1; 407 genes and cluster 2; 336 genes) or upregulated (cluster 3; 358 genes and cluster 4; 242 genes).  Genes in cluster 1 showed a trend of expression that decreased up to 12 h and increased slightly at 24 h.  Genes in cluster 2 showed a gradual decrease up to 24 h.  On the contrary, genes in cluster 3 showed overexpression up to 12 h and slight underexpression at 24 h.  Cluster 4 contained genes with gradually increasing expression up to 24 h.   To understand the effect of EGCG treatment on HepG2 cells, overrepresented biological processes of each cluster were identified using the PANTHER gene expression data analysis tool (Fig.  2B).  According to the analyses, biological processes, such as cell cycle, transcription, nucleic acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, oncogenesis, protein targeting/localization, and cell proliferation/differentiation, showed significant enrichment in cluster 1, and signal transduction, cell communication, lipid/fatty acid transport, cell structure and motility, vitamin/cofactor transport, mRNA splicing, protein phosphorylation, and purine metabolism were in cluster 2.    Clusters 3 and 4 also revealed enrichment of certain biological processes, such as protein biosynthesis, protein metabolism and modification, and B cell immunity for cluster 3 and intracellular protein traffic, vesicle transport, and amino acid metabolism for cluster 4. Treatment with EGCG led to elevated expression of genes associated with protein biosynthesis and protein modification (Table 1), including eukaryotic translation   initiation factors (EIFs), mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPLs), ribosomal proteins (RPLs), dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), peptidylprolyl isomerase H (PPIH), protein phosphatase 2A, regulatory subunit B(PPP2R4), and protease, serine, 21(PRSS21).  Many of these transcripts showed significant elevation in expression (more than 2-fold) at 12 h.  Many genes related to protein trafficking were upregulated by EGCG treatment (Table 2).  Transcripts in this biological process showed a peculiar increase in expression at 24 h.  In particular, genes like choroideremia-like (CHML), N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein gamma (NAPG), and WD repeat domain 24 (WDR24) showed overexpression, greater than 4-fold, at 24 h.  EGCG treatment turned out to cause underexpression of many genes related to lipid metabolism (Table 3).  The expression of genes involved in lipid transport, including caveolin 1 (CAV1), niemannpick disease, type C1 (NPC1), oxysterolbinding proteinlike 1A (OSBPL1A), and clusterin (CLU), were downregulated, as shown by PANTHER gene expression data analysis (Table 1).  In particular, NPC1 has been reported to be involved in the intracellular trafficking of cholesterol (Pacheco and Lieberman, 2008).  On the other hand, the expression of genes related to the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, including isopentenyldiphosphate delta isomerase 1 (IDI1), farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1), 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzymeA reductase (HMGCR), and HMGcoenzyme A synthase 1 (HMGCS1), was upregulated at 24 h after EGCG treatment.  These observations indicate that treatment with EGCG induces the synthesis and accumulation of cholesterol in HepG2 cells.   Treatment with EGCG resulted in elevated expression of cellular stress markers, such as transcription factors, markers of DNA damage, cell cycle/apoptosis, and genes associated with redox status (Table 4).  Of particular note, 3 genes-activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), gamma (CEBPG)-are known to be associated with ER stress.  The involvement of ER stress in EGCG-induced cytotoxicity was further monitored by real-time RTPCR of differentially expressed marker genes (Fig.  3).  The results showed that ATF3, which is a member of the ATF/CREB subfamily of the basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) family, was increased by more than 8-fold in 6htreated cells.  In addition, members of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors, such as the apoptosisinducing proteins GADD153 (CHOP) and GADD34, were also upregulated in 6htreated cells.  The expression of GADD153 and GADD34 was increased more than 2fold at all time points.  Prolonged ER stress can perturb mitochondria, triggering oxidative stress.  Ca2＋induced oxidative stress can cause both cell death and activation of NFкB signaling (Ji and Kaplowitz, 2006).  In this study, NFKBIE was differentially expressed at 6 h (2.6fold) and 12 h (2.2fold), but at 24 h it was not significantly expressed (1.1fold).  NFKBIE is known as a member of the family of NFκB inhibitory proteins (IκBs) that interact with NFκB in unstimulated cells (Komissarova et al., 2008), To verify the gene expression profiles from the oligonucleotide microarray, 6 genes that showed significant up  regulation were selected and subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis.  The expression pattern observed by PCR showed a concordance with the pattern assayed by microarray (Fig.  3). The objective of this study was to determine the effects of EGCG on hepatic gene expression and to understand the underlying mechanism of hepatotoxicity for this polyphenol in vitro.  Our study revealed that high concentrations of EGCG affected the expression of a large number of genes in various cellular pathways (1343 genes).  The functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes provided new insight into the molecular mechanism of EGCG for its undesirable effect.    We showed that high concentrations of EGCG activate the unfolded protein response (UPR), resulting in increased expression of ER stress response genes in cultured human HepG2 cells.  ER not only is the place of protein synthesis and package; it also plays a central role in various signaling pathways.  Dysfunction of the ER can be induced by various biological disturbances, so-called ER stress.  UPR is one of the wellknown ER stresses, and it may be associated with cellular apoptosis in HepG2 cells.  The UPR is reported to be required for safe-guarding protein synthesis, posttranslational modifications, folding and secretion, calcium storage, and calcium signaling in the normal physiological state.   In our study, EGCG exposure to HepG2 cell cultures resulted in a marked increase in the mRNA level of genes associated with protein synthesis and modification.  This is not surprising, because repairing hepatic damage requires the massive production of new proteins and modification of proteins.  EGCG treatment also revealed upregulation of many genes involved in protein secretion, including intracellular protein trafficking.  These expression patterns were consistent with those of pyrazole, a known inducer of ER stress (Nichols and Kirby, 2008).   EGCGinduced upregulation of GADD34, GADD153, and ATF3 provides genetic evidence for the presence of EGCGcaused ER stress.  Even though GADD153, a member of the C/EBP gene family of transcription factors, has already been reported to be induced by growth arrest, DNA damage, or UV irradiation, recent studies have demonstrated that the gene also has great responsivity to ER stress (Outinen et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1996).  In addition, it has previously been shown that GADD153 induces cell death by promoting protein synthesis and oxidation in the stressed endoplasmic reticulum (Marciniak et al., 2004).  The transcription of ATF3 usually increases within 2 h from stress exposure, and ATF3 protein can function as a homodimer or as a member of the complex of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factor, such as GADD153.  Jiang et al.  (2003) also found that ATF3 is induced in response to ER stress.  GADD34 encodes a regulatory subunit of an eIF2αdirectedphosphatase complex that promotes the recovery of protein synthesis in cells exposed to ER stress, causing more ER stress (Lai et al., 2007).    In addition to genes related to ER stress, apoptosisrelated genes, like BNIP3 and BNIP3L, were also upregulated around 2fold after 12 h and around 4fold after 24 h of EGCG treatment in HepG2 cells.  According to a previous report, induction of BNIP3 localized itself to mitochondria and triggered a loss of membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen species production, which often lead to cell death (Burton and Gibson, 2009).  These results imply that EGCG exposure to HepG2 cells induces BNIPmediated apoptosis through disturbances of ER functions.    There have been various studies to elucidate the molecular mechanism of EGCG activity.  Although some EGCGinteracting molecules have been identified, the molecular mechanism of its cytotoxic activity is not yet fully clarified.  Recently, Kuzuhara et al.  (2006) reported that EGCG and its related derivatives that have a galloyl group interacted with DNA and RNA directly, while catechin and its related derivatives, lacking a galloyl group,   did not interact with DNA or RNA.  On the other hand, Ermakova et al.  (2006) reported that glucoseregulating protein 78 (GRP78), a molecular chaperone in the ER, is an EGCG-binding protein.  In the report, EGCG and catechins, containing a galloyl group, showed stronger inhibition of GRP78 than EC, EGC, and catechins that lacked a galloyl group.  This observation strongly supports the existence of an interaction between the galloyl group and GRP78.    ER stress contributes to intracellular lipid accumulation, which is mediated by ER-associated transmembrane sterol response element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), an ER membrane-bound transcription factor.  SREBP1 activates genes encoding enzymes in the cholesterol/triglyceride biosynthesis and uptake pathway (Ji and Kaplowitz, 2006).  The present study showed that EGCG-induced ER stress increased the expression of genes responsible for cholesterol/triglyceride biosynthesis, including HMGCR and HMGCS1, and decreased the expression of genes responsible for lipid transport, including CAV1, NPC1, OSBPL1A, and CLU.  Interestingly, clusterin (CLU), a multifunctional heterodimeric glycoprotein, is known for its implication in a wide range of physiological functions, such as lipid transport, tissue repair and remodeling, membrane protection, and promotion of cell interaction.  It has been reported that induction of clusterin may represent a protective response against oxidative stress (Shannan et al., 2006).  More recently, clusterin has been proposed as a candidate biomarker for kidney injury (Sieber et al., 2009).    Based on the analyses of the presented microarray data, it seems clear that high concentrations of EGCG cause cell death, probably via the apoptosis pathway, by inducing ER stress and the expression of ER stress response genes (GADD153, GADD34, and ATF3).  The presented results strongly suggest that high concentrations of EGCG might cause fatty liver through ER stress-induced accumulation of lipids in living subjects.  The identification of other regulatory genes may also aid in clarifying the molecular mechanism underlying EGCG-induced hepatotoxicity.
