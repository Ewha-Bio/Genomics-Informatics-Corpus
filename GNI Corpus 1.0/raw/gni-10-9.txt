Cryptosporidium par-vum is a parasitic protozoan that causes an infectious disease. Its genome sequencing reported 14 bac-teria-like proteins in the nuclear genome. Among them, cgd2_1810, which has been annotated as CysQ, a sul-fite synthesis pathway protein, is listed as one of the candidates of genes horizontally transferred from bacte-rial origin. In this report, we examined this issue using phylogenetic analysis. Our BLAST search showed that C. parvum CysQ protein had the highest similarity with that of proteobacteria. Analysis with NCBI’s Conserved Domain Tree showed phylogenetic incongruence, in that C. parvum CysQ protein was located within a branch of proteobacteria in the cd01638 domain, a bacterial mem-ber of the inositol monophosphatase family. According to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, the sulfate assimilation pathway, where CysQ plays an important role, is well conserved in most eu-karyotes as well as prokaryotes. However, the Apicom-plexa, including C. parvum, largely lack orthologous genes of the pathway, suggesting its loss in those pro-tozoan lineages. Therefore, we conclude that C. parvum regained cysQ from proteobacteria by HGT, although its functional role is elusive.Keywords: conserved domain, Cryptosporidium parvum, CysQ, horizontal gene transfer, phylogenetic tree, sulfur assimilationIntroductionHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is the movement of ge-netic material between different species of interkingdom, and lateral gene transfer is for intrakingdom movement [1]. The concept for gene transfer was first mentioned for an acquisition of virulence between bacterial strains [2], and then, transfers of multiple drug resistance be-tween Shigellae and Escherichia coli strains were re-ported in Japan [3].   It is important to note that HGT not only affects cor-rect reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree but also helps to understand reasons of its occurrence. In bacteria, it is widely known that genetic material of antibiotic resist-ance is transferred in the gastrointestinal tract [4], and in the case of unicellular eukaryotes, such as Giardia lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Entamoeba histo-lytica, the organisms that use fermentation or anaerobic metabolism in the low-oxygen environment overcame the environmental stress by taking genes from bacteria [5]. Moreover, the transferred gene plays a positive role in adaptation to a pathogenic way of life [6]. On the other hand, HGT has been criticized, in that its bio-logical significance is overemphasized. If a gene has an essential role and participates in many interactions, its transfer might be less likely to occur than that of others or would be detrimental to the recipient. Thus, some transferred genes are considered nonfunctional [7-9].  Cryptosporidium is a parasitic protozoan of the phy-lum Apicomplexa. Among Cryptosporidium, C. parvum causes an infectious disease in humans and animals with diarrhea, called cryptosporidiosis. Although the dis-ease is prevalent where water quality is poorly man-aged, there is no satisfactory treatment until now [10, 11].   Genome sequencing of C. parvum was completed in 2004, identifying major metabolic pathways through com-parison with other parasites and also reporting those enzymes with high similarities to bacterial and plantal counterparts [12]. In some crucial biosynthesis path-ways, C. parvum has enzymes that originated from vari-ous organisms, such as bacteria, plants, and algae. Phylogenomic analyses predicted a set of genes trans-ferred from algae and eubacteria [13] and promising drug targets in nucleotide biosynthesis [14]. However, among 14 bacterial-like enzymes that were reported by Abrahamsen et al., only two enzymes received follow-up attention [15, 16].   CysQ, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase, also known as 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 3'- phosphatase, or 3'(2'), 5'-bisphosphate nucleotidase, was among the 14 bacterial-like enzymes initially re-ported by the genome analysis. It has been thought that
