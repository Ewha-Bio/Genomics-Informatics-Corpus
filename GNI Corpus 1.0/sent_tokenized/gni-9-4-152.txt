Genome-wide Survey of Copy Number Variants Associated with Blood Pressure and Body Mass Index in a Korean Population.

Hypertension is the major factor of most death and high blood pressure (BP) can lead to stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiac failure.

Moreover, hypertension is strongly correlated with body mass index (BMI).

Although the exact causes of hypertension are still unclear, some of genetic loci were discovered from genome-wide association study (GWAS).

Therefore, it is essential to study genetic variation for finding more genetic factor affecting hypertension.

The purpose of our study is to conduct a CNV association study for hypertension-related traits, BP and BMI, in Korean individuals.

We identified 2,206 CNV regions from 3,274 community-based Korean participants using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform and performed a logistic regression analysis of CNVs with two hypertension-related traits, BP and BMI.

Moreover, the 4,692 participants in an independent cohort were selected for respective replication analyses.

GWAS of CNV identified two loci encompassing previously known hypertension-related genes: LPA (lipoprotein) on 6q26, and JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) on 9p24, with suggestive pvalues (0.0334 for LPA and 0.0305 for JAK2).

These two positive findings, however, were not evaluated in the replication stage.

Our result confirmed the conclusion of CNV study from the WTCCC suggesting weak association with common diseases.

This is the first study of CNV association study with BP and BMI in Korean population and it provides a state of CNV association study with common human diseases using SNP array.

Keywords: copy number variation, hypertensionrelated traits, BMI, blood pressure, genomewide association studyCopy number variation (CNV) is defined as a loss or gain of long segments of DNA, and it is relatively common in the human genome (Freeman et al., 2006; McCarroll et al., 2008; Redon et al., 2006).

Because some chromosomal duplications and deletions are known to be associated with disease susceptibility and gene dosage, CNVs are considered major sources of genomic variation along with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Freeman et al., 2006; McCarroll et al., 2008).

A CNV study has reported populationdependent CNVs that inconsistently occur between ethnic groups (Redon et al., 2006).

To date, a number of genomic variants associating SNP loci with susceptibility to common complex human diseases have been identified through genomewide association studies (GWASs) (The WTCCC, 2007; Estivill and Armengol, 2007; Hong et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2009).

Although some CNV studies have also reported associations with several complex disorders, the corresponding CNV data are scarce compared with SNP data.

Moreover, previous GWASs reported associations of SNPs with anthropometric traits including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index (BMI) in the Korean population (Hong et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2009), but no CNV association studies with these traits have been reported.

The aims of our current study were as follows: 1) discover Korean CNV regions (CNVRs) in largescale cohort samples; 2) examine additional loci that may be associated with hypertensionrelated traits; 3) compare association results of CNVs with those of previously known risk loci.

Toward these goals, we performed a three stage analysis.

In the first stage, we conducted a genomewide survey of CNVs in 3,274 healthy Korean participants as part of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES) using the Affymetrix GenomeWide Human SNP Array 6.0 platform.

Using stringent quality control, we ascertained 2,206 CNVRs.

In the second stage, we carried out a logistic regression analysis of CNVs with two hypertensionrelated traits, BP and BMI.

Of the 3,274 participants in this study, 1,725 (602 cases, 1,123 controls) were selected for association analysis with BP; for BMI, 3,212 participants (1,112 cases, 2,100 controls) were similarly selected.

In the third stage, of the 4,692 participants genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 platform in an independent cohort, we selected 3,507 (1,561 cases, 1,946 controls) and 4,592 (2,095 cases, 2,497 controls) participants for inclusion in the respective replication analysis datasets for these two CNVRs.

In conclusion, our result is consistent with that of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) CNV study (2010).

Thus, our result confirmed the conclusion of WTCCC CNV study suggesting weak association with complex traits.

Although we also found no Asianspecific CNVs associated with hypertension-related traits, our study is the first to examine the contribution of CNVs to common complex diseases in a Korean population and will provide new insight into the genetics associated with complex traits having underlying CNVs in the Korean population.

Study participants were enrolled from a population based cohort called the Health Examinee (HEXA) cohort, which is a part of KoGES.

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood with informed consent.

Through each step of SNP quality control procedures (sample call rate ≥95%, gender inconsistency check, exclusion of cancer patients, population stratification check, etc.

), the 3,703 healthy individuals (aged between 40 and 70 years) were genotyped on the Affymetrix Human GenomeWide SNP array 6.0.

This dataset was composed of 44.6% male and 55.4% female samples.

Files with raw signal intensity (CEL files) from the 3,703 samples were converted to normalized log R intensity ratios.

Pooled referenceFor the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0, pre-processing procedures (background subtraction, normalization, summarization of probe set) were performed with the apt-probeset-summarize application (Affymetrix Power Tools; http://www.

affymetrix.

com/partners_programs/programs/developer/tools/powertools.

affx).

After pre-processing procedures, the signal intensity ratio between the test and the reference sample of each probe was transformed to log2 scale with the chromosomal coordinate of the probes (UCSC version hg18/ NCBI Build 36).

The technical artifact, spatial autocorrelation or ‘wave’, which occurs in a large dataset used to determine the location of CNV across the genome, were removed by WaveNorm software (Marioni et al., 2007).

DNA from a single individual such as NA10851 or NA15510 was used for CNV discovery in some reported CNV analyses (Redon et al., 2006; Komura et al., 2006; Olsen and Venkatraman, 2004).

However, the probability that the reference CNV region was homozygously deleted may lead to detection of falsepositive CNVs (Marioni et al., 2007; Komura et al., 2006).

Therefore, we assumed that the reference effect of a homozygously deleted CNV region could be minimized by using the pooled reference signal intensity.

Finally, we used the average intensity of 100 samples that were randomly selected from among 3,703 cohort participants rather than a single individual’s intensity (Fig.

1).

CNV detectionTo increase the robustness of CNV detection, two different algorithms, DNAcopy (Olsen and Venkatraman, 2004) and the Genome Alteration Detection Analysis (GADA) (PiqueRegi et al., 2008), were used.

To define the threshold, different threshold Ts were tested from 3 to 4.5.

Finally, we ran DNAcopy by default and the GADA R package with T=4.5, α=0.2, and MinSegLen=6 on the 3,603 individuals (excluding 100 samples for pooled reference).

In addition, the average log2 ratio for defining CNV segments was set to±0.3.

Eventually, we chose 3,274 samples with both a median of the absolute value of all pairwise differences (MAPD) of ＜0.3 and the number of CNV segments within the outlier detection limits (Q1−1.5×IQR∼Q3+1.5×IQR) (see supplementary methods: participant pruning; supplementary Fig.

S2).

After subsequent stringent qualitycontrol processes, 2,206 CNVRs were used for further studies (see supplementary methods: CNV segment selection and CNVR; supplementary Fig.

S1; supplementary Fig.

S3).

Disease association stage The basic characteristics of the participants are listed in Table 1.

In this study, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were taken from the averages of three recumbent measurements.

The 602 cases were defined as having SBP≥140 mmHg or DBP ≥90 mmHg.

The 1,123 controls were defined as having SBP＜120 mmHg and DBP＜80 mmHg.

Average SBP and DBP of study participants were 119.15±18.25 and 75.85±12.70 mmHg, respectively (Table 1).

In addition, we defined BMI as the individual’s weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared, according to the World Health Organization BMI thresholds.

The   1,112 cases were defined as having a BMI≥25 kg/m2, and the 2,100 controls were defined having 18.5≤BMI＜25 kg/m2.

The average BMI of all study participants was 24.08±2.76 (Table 1).

For the regression analysis, copy number deletion, normal and duplication were encoded to −1, 0 and +1, respectively.

Logistic regression analyses were conducted by SAS software, and all models were adjusted for gender and age.

Replication stageTwo positive CNV loci were evaluated in an independent cohort.

For replication analysis, we used 4,692 participants from the AnsungAnsan cohort, which is also a part of KoGES.

These participants were genotyped with the Affymetrix GenomeWide Human SNP Array 5.0 and passed each step of the SNP quality control procedures (sample call rate ≥96%, heterozygosity ≥30%, gender inconsistency check, exclusion of patients with tumors,  and population stratification check).

Using the same definition as for the association stage, we selected 3,507 (1,561 cases, 1,946 controls) and 4,592 (2,095 cases, 2,497 controls) individuals for BP and BMI, respectively.

The DNAcopy was used for CNV detection.

Logistic regression analyses were also conducted.

As mentioned above, 145,689 of 163,829 CNV segments were selected for further study.

These segments consisted of 53,817 gains and 91,872 losses.

Finally, 2,206 CNVRs were defined from among these CNV segments.

Of these CNVRs, 69.2% (1,527 of 2,206) overlapped by ≥1 bp with 14,411 CNVRs in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGVs; http://projects.

tcag.

ca/variation/).

Conversely, 10.7% (1,538 of 15,411) of CNVRs in DGV matched with our results (see supplementary Fig.

S4).

The average and median length of all CNVRs was 72.1 kb and 23.0 kb, respectively (see supplementary Table 1).

Moreover, an average of 44.5 CNV segments was found in each individual (see supplementary Fig.

S5).

We examined the distribution of the 2,206 CNVRs by frequency of occurrence.

Fig.

2A and Fig.

2B show the distribution of CNVRs with a frequency of more than 1% and less than 1%, respectively.

Among the CNVRs with a frequency of ＞1%, most of the detected CNVRs had a frequency of 1∼5% (Fig.

2A).

On the other hand, because we excluded all singleton CNV segments as well as some of the doubletons and tripletons according to the stringent rule (see supplementary methods: CNV region), most CNVRs with a frequency of ＜1% were included in a frequency range of 0.1∼0.5% (Fig.

2B).

The                      number of CNVRs with a frequency of ＜1% was approximately four times as many as the number with a frequency of ＞1% (Fig.

2C).

We surveyed RefSeq genes partially or entirely harboring 2,206 CNVRs and found 1,556 genes.

The PANTHER classification system (Thomas et al., 2003) was used to assess the functional implications of these CNVRs.

PANTHER results showed genes involved in metabolic processes, cellular processes and communication, immune system processes, etc (see supplementary Table 2).

We tested the association between CNVs and two kinds of applicable anthropometry traits, BP and BMI.

In all, 14 CNVRs that overlapped by ≥1 bp with 18 genes were significantly associated with BP and hypertension with pvalue＜0.05.

Regarding an association between BMI and CNV, 14 CNVRs that overlapped by ≥1 bp with 13 genes showed association, with pvalue＜0.05 (Table 2).

To compare all 31 genes with previously reported genetic associations, we used Genopedia in HuGE Navigator (Yu et al., 2008).

Two CNVRs encompassing known hypertensionrelated genes, LPA and JAK2, were observed with suggestive pvalues (0.0334 for LPA and 0.0305 for JAK2).

CNV loci overlapping LPA were registered in DGV.

These two CNVRs were selected for further replication studies.

For the replication stage, CNV loci overlapping LPA and JAK2 were observed with nonsignificant pvalues of 0.8687 (odds ratio: 1.041, 95% confidence interval: 0.644∼1.684) and 0.2782 (odds ratio: 0.775, 95% confidence interval: 0.489∼1.229), respectively (Fig.

3).

Hypertension refers to a clinically significant increase in BP, and it is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease; further, excess body weight is a major risk factor for hypertension (The WTCCC, 2007).

Development of hypertension, however, hypertension has a multifactorial etiology, including both genetic and environmental factors.

Therefore, the distinctive causes and factors of hypertension are still not fully understood.

In this study, we found that two CNVRs overlapped with previously known risk loci, namely LPA on 6q26 and JAK2 on 9p24.

Some association studies have been reported regarding these loci.

For example, common variants in LPA are associated with myocardial infarction (Deo et al., 2011).

In particular, higher copy numbers of the kringle (IV) domain in this protein are associated with lower lipoprotein levels (van der Hoek et al., 1993).

Moreover, Wong et al.

(2007) conducted a CNV analysis using a whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).

Among the detected CNVs, they found CNV loci overlapping LPA.

Association of BP with JAK2 has also been reported.

Guilluy et al.

(2010) showed that inhibition of JAK2 prevents angiotensin II-mediated hypertension in wild-type mice.

In contrast with the results of the association stage, the two positive findings were not confirmed in the replication stage.

CNV loci overlapping LPA and JAK2 were observed with nonsignificant p-values.

In the association stage, other well-established risk loci such as ATP2B1, FTO, MC4R, PPYR1, ST7L-CAPZA1, FIGNGRB14, ENPEP, NPR3, and TBX3 that were observed in previous GWAS or CNV studies (Sha et al., 2009; Levy et al., 2009; Newton-Cheh et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2011; Frayling et al., 2007; Loos et al., 2008; Glessner et al., 2010; Dorajoo et al., 2011) were not observed in our current study.

There are some potential reasons for why these loci were not significantly observed in our study.

First, risk loci affecting hypertension may differ when studying CNVs and SNPs.

Alternatively, rare CNV variants may affect the etiology of hypertension, or hypertension may have few common risk alleles that each has a relatively large effect.

Finally, some of the controls may have been misclassified as cases owing to limitations of current CNV genotyping technology.

Similar results supporting our study have been reported.

The WTCCC performed an association study of common CNVs with eight common diseases including hypertension using the original WTCCC study samples (WTCCC, 2010) and identified three CNV loci that were associated with common diseases.

They concluded, however, that none of the three loci was believed to be a functional variant and that common CNVs may not play a major role in the genetic basis of common diseases (WTCCC, 2010).

Similar to the conclusion of WTCCC, few association studies of complex diseases with CNVs as newly discovered genetic markers have been reported.

For example, Charchar et al.

(2010) conducted a genomewide survey of CNVs in the spontaneously hypertensive rat; they identified and validated 16 CNVs associated with the spontaneously hypertensive phenotype.

In contrast with the association in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, Johnson et al.

(2009) found no association of CNVs in BMPR2 with pulmonary arterial hypertension in human.

Our data are consistent with those of the WTCCC CNV study, which suggests that functional variants and common CNVs may not play a major role in the genetic basis of common diseases (WTCCC, 2010).

Moreover, the absence of a positive result in the rep  lication stage of our study may be due to the frequency of occurrence.

That is, because recurrence rates of uncommon (or less common) CNV loci with frequencies of 1∼5% may vary between populations, our two positive findings (2.9% for LPA and 1.9% for JAK2) may not be replicated in the association stage.

Alternatively, similar to the association stage, the limitation of platform resolution may lead to replication failure.

Consequently, to resolve obstacles underlying a CNV association study such as the complexity of the genetic architecture for hypertension and the limitation of the current CNV genotyping techniques, a more comprehensive study with a higher-resolution platform will be necessary to identify genetic variants that affect hypertension.

There are some limitations associated with our approach.

As we used the Affymetrix 5.0 for the replication stage, we could not address whether two signals were not replicated or were false positive signals.

Therefore, validation experiment such as quantitative PCR (qPCR) is needed for the accurate analysis.

In conclusion, our result is consistent with that of the WTCCC CNV study.

Thus, our study confirmed the conclusion of WTCCC CNV study suggesting no association with complex traits.

In addition, this is the first CNV association to examine the contribution of CNVs to hypertension in a Korean population.

Therefore, our study will also provide new insight into the genetics associated with complex traits having CNVs in the Korean population.
