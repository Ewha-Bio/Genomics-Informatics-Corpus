Genome-wide Association Study Identified TIMP2 Genetic Variant with Susceptibility to Osteoarthritis.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disorder in the elderly population.  To identify OA-associated genetic variants and candidate genes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS).  A total 3,793 samples (476 cases: wrist ＋ knee and 3317 controls) from a community-based epidemiological study were genotyped using the Affymetrix SNP 5.0.  An intronic SNP (rs4789934) in the TIMP2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2) showed the most significance with OA (odd ratio [OR] = 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-2.81, p = 4.01 × 10－6).  Furthermore, a polymorphism (rs1352677) in the NKAIN2 (Na＋/K＋ transporting ATPase interacting 2) was suggestively associated with OA (OR = 1.43, CI = 1.22-1.66, p = 7.01 × 10－6).  The present study provides new insights into the identification of genetic predisposing factors for OA. Keywords: genome-wide association study, osteoarthritis, polymorphism, TIMP2Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder characterized by progressive cartilage loss, and consequently increases serious social/economic problems in the elderly population worldwide (Du et al., 2005; Ikegawa, 2007).  As with any joint affected by osteoarthritis, the primary symptom for wrist and knee OA as predominant weightbearing joints is intractable pain with increased stiffness.  Specifically, wrist OA can occurs secondary to an intraarticular fracture of the distal radius or an extraarticular fracture resulting in malunion (Weiss and Rodner, 2007).  Several risk factors such as age, gender, obesity, and trauma have been confirmed as environmental confounding factors (Haq et al., 2003).   So far, genetic factors contribute to the risk of OA have been identified through candidate gene approaches (Loughlin, 2002; MacGregor and Spector, 1999).  However, candidate genebased studies (Miyamoto et al., 2007; Mototani et al., 2005; RodriguezLopez et al., 2008) have only a small fraction of genetic interactions involved in the pathogenesis, and thereby provide little chance of discovering novel candidate genes.   As a solution to the problem, OA susceptibility genes by recent GWAS have been reported across different groups (Abel et al., 2006; Dai and Ikegawa, 2010; Loughlin, 2002; Spector et al., 2006).  However, most of the previously reported findings have produced conflicting results with differential genetic effects and limited replication between ethnic populations.  (Jiang et al., 2008; Kerkhof et al., 2008; Shi et al., 2008; Snelling et al., 2007; Valdes et al., 2007).  The ethnicspecific variants remain to be identified in East Asian population to overcome ethnic difference and population structure.  We therefore undertook a genomewide association study to identify genetic polymorphisms influencing OA. The study samples were drawn from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) which is an ongoing prospective communitybased epidemiological study in the communities of Ansung (rural) and Ansan (urban) (Table 1).  Details of the KoGES and the methods are described in our previous report (Cho et al., 2006; Cho et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2006).  In brief, eligible subjects (age 4069 years) were examined in 20012002 for demography and epidemiology and then follow up biannually.  A total of 3,588 men and    3,927 women agreed to participate in a baseline examination which included an interview, blood tests, Xrays, and measurement of the body.  Informed consents were obtained from all of the participants, and Declaration of Helsinki for biomedical research involving human subjects was also followed.  The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. X-rays of both wrists and knees of subjects were taken.  Radiographic OA was assessed using the Kellgren/ Lawrence (K/L) grading system (Kellgren and Lawrence, 1957).  Patients with K/L grades of 2 or higher in wrists or knees were diagnosed with OA.  Among the 7,515 subjects of the study, 3,793 subjects consented to the X-ray examination.  Of these, 476 patients were diagnosed with OA (387 women, 89 men, median age = 68 years [range 44-74]), and 3,317 subjects were classified as normal controls (women=1,773, men=1,544, median age = 57 years [range 43-74]). Genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells was used for this study.  We performed a pilot GWAS, typing cases and controls on a single platform using the Affymetrix GenomeWide Human SNP 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA).  Genotype calls were determined by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance algorithm (Rabbee and Speed, 2006).  Details of the genotyping process are presented in our previous report (Cho et al., 2009).  Of the SNPs assayed on the chip, 179,626 SNPs were excluded because they showed: 1) a call rate lower than 96.0% in cases or controls; or 2) a minor allele frequency (MAF) ＜ 1% in the population; or 3) a significant distortion from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (p ＜ 0.05).  A total of 320,942 SNPs passed all the quality control filters (mean call rate 98.0%).  To identify the effect of population stratification, the genomic inflation factor (λ) (Clayton et al., 2005) was calculated for all individuals.  The two study cohorts (Ansung and Ansan) have shown very   similar MAFs for the SNPs on the array, and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) analysis for the comparison of genotype frequencies in both cohorts confirmed the genetic homogeneity of these two components of the KoGES study population (Cho et al., 2009). The allele frequencies in OA cases were compared to those in controls using the Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis.  The associations between the case control status and each individual SNP were measured by the odds ratio (OR).  Covariates used for multivariable-adjustment were age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), because these variables were significantly associated with OA in our cohort.    Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the polymorphisms was determined by the expectation maximization algorithm.  When determining LD between SNPs, we used either of two measures of LD: an r2 value ≥ 0.8 or a disequilibrium coefficient (D’) ≥ 0.95.  PLINK software program (http://pngu. mgh. harvard. edu/ ~purcell/plink/), Haploview program (http://www. broad.  mit. edu/mpg/haploview), and SAS program (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) were used for statistical analysis.  The Q-Q plot indicated lack of inflation due to stratification, and no differences between case and control populations were detected.  The estimated genomic control inflation factor (λ) was 1.009, indicating limited evidence of population stratification in the KARE study samples - are described in Fig.  1.  Table 2 lists the most significant genetic variants from GWAS analysis.  We identified two intronic SNPs with Pvalues ＜ 1×10－5.  A SNP (rs4789934) in the TIMP2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase2) gene showed the most significant association with OA.  The adjusted ORs were 2.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.522.81), and the adjusted Pvalues were 4.01×10－6.  In addition, our study also identified suggestive association in the NKAIN2 (Na＋/K＋ transporting ATPase interacting 2) (OR = 1.43, CI = 1.221.66, p = 7.01×10－6).    To support the biological relevance in silico, we provide graphically summarized information on preliminary association by confidence values of textual evidence (Fig.  1.  D).  Nodes represent biological entities with different colors for different classes.  Edges represent strong associations between two entities (i. e., TIMP2 effects to tissue inhibition, and functional interactions with TIMP4). In this study, we identified two novel polymorphisms associated with OA.  Intronic SNPs, rs4789934 in TIMP2 and rs1352677 in NKAIN2, showed significant associations with OA.  To date, OA susceptibility genes from genomewide association studies have been reported primarily in samples of European descent.    The function of TIMP2 is inhibition of MMP.  Osteoarthritic cartilage is characterized by the imbalance between MMPs and TIMPs.  The level of lytic enzymes such as MMP1, MMP3, and MMP13 was increased, and the level of TIMP1 was decreased in OA cartilage (Krane and Inada, 2008; MartelPelletier et al., 1994).  With the decreasing level of TIMP, MMP activity increases and leads to further destruction of cartilage, the key process in OA (Cawston, 1998; Krane and Inada, 2008).  Estrogen may regulate the balance between MMP and TIMP activity (Lee et al., 2003), which would explain the gender and menopausal correlations with OA.  Although prior reports focused primarily on TIMP1, levels of TIMP2, a member of the same gene family, have also been shown to increase in osteoarthritic cartilage (MartelPelletier et al., 1994).  Lee et al. .  reported that TIMP4 polymorphism (rs17035945) was associated with the risk of OA in the Korean population as a result   of altering the folding of the mRNA (Lee et al., 2008).   The Na＋/K＋ ATPase is an important regulator of ion homeostasis in many cell types (Mobasheri et al., 2000), but its role in OA is not clear.  In osteoblasts, which synthesize collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components, the Na＋/K＋ ATPase appears to maintain the transmembrane gradient of Na＋ that drives intracellular calcium homeostasis and ECM calcification (Francis et al., 2002).  Hence, the role of NKAIN2 in the pathogenesis of OA may be related to control of mineralization and maintenance of the ECM.  However, the Na＋/ K＋ ATPase is expressed in diverse cell types in the human body and is not specific to OA.  The detailed contributions of the Na＋/K＋ ATPase to the pathogenesis of OA should be clarified in further investigations.    The genetic susceptibility to OA is likely to vary for different joint sites (Peach et al., 2005).  The criteria used to diagnose OA also differ among studies and may explain conflicting information.  Some studies used clinical diagnosis while other studies using X-ray and K/L grades (Kerkhof et al., 2008; Miyamoto et al., 2007; Spector et al., 2006).   The present study contains some limitations.  No SNPs met conventional genome-wide significance level of ＜ 5 × 10－8, and no replication.  However it would be interesting to use the data available to perform meta-analysis or SNP lookup from a large international consortium in future studies to evaluate the significance of our results.   In an attempt to address function prediction of SNP allele, we conducted in silico functional investigation to an uncharacterized sequence variant (Yuan et al., 2006).  The lead SNP (rs4789934) was a predicted functional cofactor, affecting transcription factor binding sites in the intronic enhancer region.  This result was further associated with functional connectivity derived from bioinformative approaches (Lee and Shatkay, 2009; Szklarczyk et al. ).  Therefore, this concordance of the functional evidence with the previous studies suggests an encouraging sign of the results in our GWAS.  However, the biological relevance of literature-derived targets needs to be fully validated with experimental tests.   In conclusion, we suggest that a novel polymorphism (rs4789934) in TIMP2 was associated with OA.  Follow up studies performed with multiple ethnic populations or larger sample are needed before the effect of the variant can be fully and accurately evaluated.  We anticipate that identification of the causal variants through deep sequencing and their functional consequences will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of OA.
