Chromosomal Information of 1,144 Korean BAC Clones

We sequenced 1,841 BAC clones by terminal sequencing, and 1,830 of these clones were characterized with regard to their human chromosomal location and gene content using    Korean    BAC    library    constructed    at    the    Korean Science (KCGS). Sequence analyses of the 1,830 BAC clones     was     performed     for     chromosomal     assignment: 1,144 clones were assigned to a single chromosome, 190 clones apparently assigned to more than one chromosome, and 496 clones to no chromosome. Evaluating gene content of the 1,144 BAC clones, we found that 706 clones represented 1,069 genes of which 415 genes existed in the BAC clones covering the full sequence of the gene, 180 genes covering a 50%~99%, and 474 genes covering less than 50% of the gene coverage. The estimated covering size of the KBAC clones was 73,379 kilobases (kb), in total corresponding to 2.3% of haploid human genome sequence. The identified BAC clones will be a public genomic resource for mapped clones for diagnostic and functional studies by Korean scientists and investigators worldwide.

The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium published the first draft of the human genome in Nature in

February 2001 (Lander et al., 2001), and later published the sequence of the entire genome (International Hunam genome    Sequencing    Consortium,    2004).    These    Reports suggested    that    the    number    of    human    genes    may    be -34,000,    significantly    fewer    than    previous    estimates    that ranged from 50,000-140,000 (Roest Crollius eta/., 2000). Complete analyses of chromosomes 6, 7,14, and 20-22 have already been published. In October 2003, complete data for chromosome 6 were published online in Nature, and complete data for chromosomes 7,14,20, 21 and 22 were published in July 2003 (Hillier eta/., 2003), February 2003 (Heilig etal., 2003), December2001 (Deloukas eta/., 2001), May 2000 (Hattori eta/., 2000) and December 1999 (Dunham eta/., 1999), respectively.

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) use F-factor- based vectors and are suitable for propagation of DNA segments up to 300 kb in Escherichia coli (Shizuya et a/., 1992). Their stability over hundreds of generations, capacity to hold genomic inserts of large size, and ease of manipulation have established BACs as invaluable tools for a variety of applications in human genetics, most importantly for the mapping and sequencing of the human genome (McPherson eta/., 2001; Lander eta/., 2001 ).As a result of the Human Genome Project, the majority of human genes are available in a characterized and sequenced BAC format. BACs have many advantages for the cloning of large-insert genomic DNAs of a species and have been used for a variety of genetic applications, including physical mapping    of chromosomes and large-scale sequencing of genomes.

A BAC clone containing an entire specific gene locus was used to study gene regulation in a mode! tissue culture-based system. Also, a BAC that lacked a putative negatively regulating promoter sequence was constructed and used to transfect cell lines (Bochukova et al., 2003). These experimental systems illustrate the potential of BAC clones in large-scale gene expression studies, new gene therapy strategies, and validation of potential molecular targets for drug discovery (Bochukova et al., 2003). Several very efficient methods have been developed for manipulating BAC clones by retrofitting constructs with marker and selection genes (Mejia etal., 1997; Kim etal., 1998; Wang etal., 2001). Both nonviral (Hart et al., 1998) and infectious (Wade-Martins et al., 2001) novel gene transfer approaches have been developed and used for genomic clone delivery. A BAC library has been constructed to provide reliable and efficient materials for constructing

sequence-ready maps (Kim etal., 1996). Also, BAC clones have been used to identify SNPs for specific genes or regions in the human genome and for physical mapping studies. Map-based cloning and genome projects have identified many individual genes, and these genes will be useful for other applications in biotechnology, diagnostics and gene therapy. In particular, identified genes can be used in transcienic-based approaches for further functional analysis. Therefore, 1,841 BAC    clones    were randomly selected from the Korean BAC    library,    and BAC end sequences were determined. We obtained the information on the chromosomal locations of specific genes should be useful for studies of gene function and genomic analysis.

A total of 100,224 clones for the Korean BAC library were prepared from male donor DNA, and a 2.9-fold redundant KBAC library was constructed (Park et al., 2006). 100,224 BAC clones were placed in both of 1,044 96-well plates and 261 384-well plates. And four superpooled KBAC libraries were constructed to quickly isolate desired BAC clones by colony PCR.

A single BAC colony was picked and inoculated into 2 ml 2xYT medium containing chloramphenicol (6.25 p.g/ml) and incubated with shaking for 16 h at 37°C. BAC DNA was isolated by the standard alkaline lysis method (Sambrook etal. 1989). After incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm in swing bucket Qiagen 09366Ffor 10 min, and plasmids were purified with a plasmid purification kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The supercoiled BAC DNA was isolated and digested with the restriction enzymes HindWl or Not\ to identify DNA inserts from the BAC plasmids.

BAC    ends    were    sequenced    using    BigDye    Terminators (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) with an ABI3100 and ABI3730 automated sequencer. The BAC end sequences were     determined     using     M13     oligonucleotide     primers: forward     (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3')     and     reverse (5‘-CGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3’). Reaction mixturess contained 0.5pg of DNA, 2pl of BigDye terminator mix, 50of universal and reverse primers consisting of 13 oligonucleotides in a total volume of 20pl. This mix was denatured at 95°C for 5followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 45sec, 55°C for 30sec, and 60°C for 4min. Excess BigDye terminators were removed using the Montage SEQ Cleanup kit (Millipore).

As a part of sequence analysis, computational KBAC clone system and a few database systems on analysis information of Korean BAC clones have been constructed to provide information of sequences homology and genes in the BAC clones and their lengths and chromosomal locations, and to    manage    BLAST    search    processes    and    results.    This system was consists of process manager and map viewer. Submitted forward and reverse sequences (the FASTA format) of BAC clones on this system analyzed using BLAST with an E-value better than 1e‘ 10 to human genomes. Human genomes data was used NCBI data ( ftp://ftp.ncbi . nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/ , build number: 35, version: 1). The BLAST results were parsed by process manager, and the parsed data-set systematically stored in database system. Finally, process manager perform a database search to find the involved complete genes in the KBAC clones.

A total of 1,841 Korean BAC(KBAC) clones were randomly selected from a KBAC library containing 100,224 clones and were sequenced by BAC-end sequencing, which was performed and preserved by the KCGS. Of these, 11 clones have not been sequenced at the first step, but 1,830 clones were characterized and localized to specific chromosomes by BLAST search. BLAST analysis localized 1,144 BAC clones to chromosomes totaling 73.4 Mb, which corresponds to about 2.3% of the human haploid genome (Table 1). A

total of 686 BAC clones were not located by BLAST, including 190 BAC clones were too much matched on chromosomes and 496 clones that did not localize to any chromosome. Of the 1,144 BAC clones, 438 clones did not encode a gene; 706 clones, however, were found to encode partial or full sequences of 1,069 genes that were eliminated duplicated genes in the genome (Fig. 1). The 706 clones included 415 genes covering 100% of the whole gene sequence, 180 genes covering >50%, and 474 genes covering <50% (Table 2). The 415 fully covered genes may be used directly or indirectly to study gene function. The KBAC sequence information also will be useful for the unambiguous identification of genomic regions, for obtaining information on full-length genes, and for

producing clones for functional studies. The 1,069 genes were     evenly     distributed     among     chromosomes     using sequence-based maps (Fig. 2).

To evaluate the importance of individual BAC clones identified in this study, we performed sequence comparisons using the CancerGenetics and Cancer500 databases, which    contain    1,584    candidate    cancer    genes.    Of    these

cancer genes, 45 genes were partially included in our BAC clones while12 genes, 2,970 bp, AXL(42,848 bp), CXCL9 (6,018    bp),    CXCL10(2,377    bp),    EWSR1    (32,234    bp), HFE(9,611     bp),     SLC2A4(5,292     bp),     TERC(450     bp), TGM4(39,966 bp), THBS1 (16,388 bp), TIMP1 (3,380 bp), and TRIM29(26,868 bp) were completely included in the KBAC clones (Table 3). Those clones could provide

genome sequences to isolate the whole gene and other applications (e.g., promoter analysis).

Our BAC library of Korean is constructed for several purposes,    for    example    to    compare    nucleotide    diversity among ethnic groups. This KBAC library will be a useful reference, especially for comparing the levels of nucleotide diversity in genome-wide regions. In addition, the KBAC clones were also intended to be used for BAC-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analyses. Comparative genomic studies with vertebrate    genomes will lead to a better understanding of the    molecular mechanisms     responsible     for     vertebrate     novelties     and provide insight into the origins of modern species. Our KBAC library will benefit both biomedical and biological communitiesfor     these     genomic     applications.     Recently, BAC-based CGH showed a significant impact in the field of cancer cytogenetics as a powerful tool for the detection of    aberrations    in    chromosome    copy    numbers,    even    in epithelial solid tumors, in which tumor-specific genomic alterations are difficult to detect using conventional cytogenetics (Veltman etal., 2002; Albertson and Pinkel, 2003; Mantripragada et al., 2004). Finally, BAC end sequencing was introduced as a tool for virtual library screening to search for BACs overlapping with large sequence contigs and to establish a baseline from which to expand contiguous sequences. KBAC sequence information also will be useful for the unambiguous identification of genomic regions, for obtaining information on full-length genes, and for producing clones for functional studies.

The immediate goal of this study was to obtain sequences of the KBAC clones. These sequences will be useful for a variety of genetic applications, including physical mapping of chromosomes and sequencing of large parts of the genome. The mapped BAC clones will serve as a valuable resource for reference sequences in highly variable regions, for promoter analysis and for comparative genomics studies.
