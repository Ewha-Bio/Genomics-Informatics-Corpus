Abstract.
During the last decade, large community cohorts have been established by the Korea National Institutes of Health (KNIH), and enormous epidemiological and clinical data have been accumulated. Using these information and samples in the cohorts, KNIH set out to do a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2007, and the Korea Association REsource (KARE) consortium was launched to analyze the data to identify the underlying genetic risk factors of diseases and diverse health indexes, such as blood pressure, obesity, bone density, and blood biochemical traits. The consortium consisted of 6 research divisions, formed by 25 principal investigators in 19 organizations, including 18 universities, 2 institutes, and 1 company. Each division focused on one of the following subjects: the identification of genetic factors, the statistical analysis of gene-gene interactions, the genetic epidemiology of gene-environment interactions, copy number variation, the bioinformatics related to a GWAS, and a GWAS of nutrigenomics. In this special issue, the study results of the KARE consortium are provided as 9 articles. We hope that this special issue might encourage the genomics community to share data and scientists, including clinicians, to analyze the valuable Korean data of KARE.MMain Text.
Most common diseases are influenced by multiple genetic factors as well as environmental factors. However, each single genetic effect might contribute a small part to the phenotype. Therefore, large sample sizes and genome-wide analysis are necessary to identify multiple genetic factors. Since 2001, the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) has established cohorts nationwide and accumulated epidemiological and clinical information on a large scale, up to 300,000 subjects. Using these samples, KNIH set to produce genotype data in 2007 and proceeded to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In order to make the most of the massive phenotype and genotype data set, the extramural research consortium was organized to host scientists interested in these data. The Korea Association REsource (KARE) consortium consists of 6 research divisions, formed by 25 principal investigators in 19 organizations, including 18 universities, 2 institutes, and 1 company. Each division focused on one of following subjects: the identification of genetic factors, the statistical analysis of gene-gene interactions, the genetic epidemiology of gene-environment interactions, copy number variation, bioinformatics related to GWAS, and a GWAS of nutrigenomics.  In this issue, 9 papers were selected from the consortium. Hong et al. (2010) investigated the feasibility of using imputed SNPs for a GWAS with blood pressure traits to determine whether they could improve the previous results that were analyzed without imputation (Cho et al., 2009). Park et al. (2010) performed a GWAS for blood pressure with 3 different phenotype models: young hypertensive cases versus elderly normotensive controls, the upper 25% versus the lower 25% of SBP distribution, and SBP and DBP as continuous traits. Kim et al. (2010c) conducted a GWAS for hematological parameters using copy number variations. Kwon and Kim (2010) analyzed a GWAS for 3 erythrocyte traits, such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells. Doo and Kim (2010) conducted an association study between an ADIPOQ gene SNP (rs182052) and obesity in Korean women. Kim et al. (2010b) compared the Affymetrix SNP array 5.0 and oligoarray platforms for defining copy number variation. Oh et al. (2010) applied a joint identification approach to large-scale GWA data in order to identify genetic variants of obesity for the Korean population. Kim et al. (2010a) applied a structural equation model to a GWAS for the following two purposes: to model a complex relationship between a genetic network and traits as risk factors and to achieve a better understanding of the biological mechanism through not only a single gene but also many genes involved in the pathway of the trait. Kim et al. (2010d) conducted targeted resequencing of loci identified by the KARE GWAS to detect potential casual and/or rare variants for complex traits, such as type 2 diabetes and triglycerides.  During the last 2 years of the consortium, there have been more than 15 meetings and gatherings to present and discuss results of the KARE data analysis. Up to 100 participants were involved in the discussions, establishing a new paradigm of science in genomics in Korea. The events would not have been possible had KNIH decided not to make the valuable data open to the consortium. As members of the consortium, we appreciate the members of the Center for Genome Science in KNIH, the Ansung and Ansan epidemiological cohorts, and DNALink for producing and managing such enormous and valuable resources. Lastly, we hope to apply these investigations to better serve the health of the participants in the cohorts.(p0.05). These results suggest that the imputation method can facilitate the discovery of novel SNPs as well as enhance the fine structure of the association peak in the loci.IIntroduction.
The human genome contains ~10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but only a small fraction of them has been assayed using current high-density microarrays, such as Illumina and Affymetrix platforms. To enhance an original association study, the genotypes of untyped SNPs can be imputed based on nearby markers and can be tested for association with phenotypes of interest. This strategy enables researchers to easily replicate and compare previous findings across array types and enables them to test a large number of SNPs to reveal the fine structure of the association peak, facilitating interpretation of the results and the location of causal polymorphisms (Hao et al., 2009). By using the imputed SNPs, Tobin and colleagues identified a significant association of the WNT1 gene with diastolic blood pressure, and Knouff and colleagues identified a significant association between the CETP gene and diastolic blood pressure (Knouff et al., 2008; Tobin et al., 2008).The first genomewide association study for large cohorts in Korea was conducted by the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH) and reported associations with 8 quantitative traits, including blood pressure (Cho et al., 2009). The Korean GWAS suggested a total of 14 loci for blood pressure, 2 (ATP2B1 and 10 p15.1) of which were significant association loci (p-value10Methods.
Subjects and their genotypes were reported in a previous genomewide association study (Cho et al., 2009). Briefly, subjects came from 2 community-based cohorts, the rural community Ansung and the urban community Ansan, in KyungGi-Do province, near Seoul, Korea. Most DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of participants and genotyped using the Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). After the quality control steps, we finally used estyle factors that are known to cause hypertension include sedentary lifestyle, high stress, high salt intake, and alcohol consumption (Kyrou et al., 2006). Both blood pressure and hypertension are traditional examples of complex traits controlled by the complex interplay of genes and environmental factors (Pickering et al., 1959). The heritability of blood pressure ranges from 31% to 68%, depending on studies based on different measurements of SBP and DBP (Pilia et al., 2006; Tobin et al., 2005).Ehret (2010) summarized the 12 genomewide association studies (GWASs) on blood pressure and hyper-to 59 years who participated in the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES). The KoGES were performed as cohorts for chronic disease (diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, obesity and metabolic syndrome) in adults aged between 40-69, who were recruited from two community-based epidemiology studies in the rural Ansung and urban Ansan commun-lation. We carried out GWAS of CNV for the chosen traits and identified several loci associated with these traits. The loci identified in our study are different from than those reported in a previous GWAS of SNP.Methods.
We collected data from 10,004 individuals in two populations from rural Ansung and urban Ansan cohorts as me Analyzer (GA), Roche/454 FLX system, and ABI SOLiD system, recently have significantly improved throughput and reduced the cost remarkably as compared to capillary-based electrophoresis systems (Shendure et al., 2004). For example, in a single experiment using the Roche/454 FLX, the sequences of approximately 100 million reads of up to 350 bases in length can be determined (Rothberg et al., r detecting CNVs (Baumbusch, 2008; Curtis and Lynch, 2010; Hester et al., 2009), but there has been no report that validated the accuracy and reproducibility of CNVs identified by Affymetrix SNP array 5.0. In this study, we compared the characteristics of CNVs from the same set of genomic DNAs detected by three different array platforms; Affymetrix SNP array 5.0, Agilent 2X244K CNV array and NimbleGen 2.1M CNV array. h substantial changes in three obesity-related phenotypes (Scuteri et al., 2007). Feitosa et al. used BMI and performed a linkage study from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study. They found significant signals near the leptin gene (chromosome 7q32.3) and chromosome 13q14 (Feitosa et al., 2002). Liu et al. identified the CTNNBL1 gene for obesity from US Caucasian and French replication case-control samples. They also confirmed the previously identified associations between obesity and INSIG2 and PFKP (Liu et al., 2008).   Loos et al. performed association studies in chromosomal region 18q21 and reported that common variants near the MC4R gene influence fat mass, weight, and obesity risk (Loos et al., 2008). Thorleifsson et al. con-om complex interactions among multiple genetic factors and environmental factors.   In this study, we applied Structural Equation Models (SEMs) in order to model complex relationships between genetic networks and traits as risk factors (Bollen, 1989). The SEM was originally developed in the field of social science to fit a model with unobserved variables. It is well known that the main advantage of the SEM approach is that it allows us to compare several candidate models. Our application of the SEM to a GWAS enables us to investigate how each risk factor affects a targeted trait directly or through other variables, and SEM is used to represent the relationship among multiple phenotypes. In order to choose the components
