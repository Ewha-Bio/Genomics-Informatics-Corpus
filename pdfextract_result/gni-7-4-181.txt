Abstract.
Since its first release in 2007, the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS) has provided pharmacogenomic and comparative information specific to Koreans to allow regulatory reviewers and researchers to adapt their working practices to pharmacogenomics. The highlights of this years additions include "Drug Information", "Gene Information" and "Pharmacogenomic information in the drug labels" sections. These new additions provide information on 737 genes, 719 drugs and pharmacogenomic data of the labels or relabels of 253 approved drugs as of November 2008. The latest version of the Korean Pharmacogenomic Database (KPD, release 2.0) has expanded significantly since its previous release. More SNP and haplotype information has been added to the database with the latest version of the KPD containing approximately four times as many SNPs and haplotypes than the previous version (719 vs. 152, and 30 vs. 7 respectively). Through the "SNP" and "Haplotype" sections, the KPD provides unique Korean SNP and haplotype information as well as comparative information of other populations (Japanese, Chinese, European, African) to offer a range of pharmacogenomic data that can help reviewers and the public understand pharmacogenomic information. The quality and quantity of information in the KPD has also been improved considerably. This data can be found at: http://www.nitr.go.kr/nitr/contents/m134700/view.do/.IIntroduction.
The Internet is an ideal platform for storing, providing and exchanging large-scale genetic information, and there are a large number of web-based bioinformatics sites worldwide. These databases are operated by many organizations for a variety of purposes, and offer huge volumes of information online for public access (Chang Kug Kim 2009; Hongseok Tae 2009; Innocenti 2005; Werner Kalow 2002).  The most well-known pharmacogenomic information database is the Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB, www.pharmGKB. org), which is the most comprehensive pharmacogenomic information database in the world. The PharmGKB provides information on genotypes, molecular and functional assays, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes to those involved in pharmacogenomic research (Innocenti 2005).   However, this database contains a wide range of information, and beginners can find it difficult to obtain the required data from this information labyrinth. First-time visiting researchers find it extremely difficult to locate the desired information on the PharmGKB. There are no databases that provide unique Korean information on the SNP and Haplotypes in drug-metabolism-related genes. In addition, there is no information on the relationships between particular SNPs and the drug metabolism, which can be used to identify candidate genes affecting disease progression or drug reactions.  The Korean Pharmacogenomic database (KPD) was developed to allow easier searches for Korean Pharmacogenomic information (Tae Sun Kang et al., 2008), and is located at the National Institute of Food and Drug Safety Evaluation (NIFDS) homepage. When the KPD was first released in 2007, it offered the selected and specialized data (mainly SNP and haplotype information in liver metabolizing enzymes, trasporters and receptors). For the convenience of the public, researchers and scientific reviewer, link functions to major intermational databases (NCBI, dbSNP database, and PharmGKB) were established in the KPD.  Since its first release, the KPD has been used in a wide range of applications including drug evaluations, selection of SNPs in Koreans and general pharmacogenomic education. The KPD is being updated con-tinuously to provide more practical pharmacogenomic information for drug evaluations. This paper reports these developments as well as the many additions and improvements appearing in the latest version of the KPD (release 2.0)Methods.
Oracle 10g was used for database management system and the interface between database and web was implemented on JAVA/JSP. Details related to the genotype information, linkage disequilibrium blocks, haplotype structures and database organization on the KPD have been described previously (Tae Sun Kang et al., 2008). Drug and pharmacogenomic information in drug label were obtained from the Physicians Desk Reference (2007) for the U.S.A, the National Health Service homepage (http://emc.medicines.org.uk/) for the U.K, Drugs in Japan (2007) for Japan and DIMS and EZDRUG for Korea respectively.For completeness of the database, each data used in the KPD is entered or prepared by one menber of the clinical research division in NIFDS and separately validated by second member of the clinical research division. Additional spot checks are routinely performed on each entry by senior members of the review group, including two phamacists, a statistician and a PhD-level genetist.Results.
The KPD was developed to collect genetic information unique to the Korean population, and to allow easy information searches within the numerous databases available. It is also expected to act as a bridge that facilitates easier information gathering through links to larger databases that provide more precise information. With the increasing need to provide more practical information to evaluate drugs as well as educate scientific reviewers and the public, three new data field additions have been added and database size and coverage has been expanded.As shown in Table 1, the KPD has three new additions. Gene Information sectionThe Gene information section was established to provide information on genes, such as those encoding the major drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and receptors, which can affect the drug response (adverse effects and efficacy), based on the SNPs provided in the "SNP information" section. A total of 737 genes are arranged in alphabetical order to allow easy access, and the number of relevant genes is recorded next to each entry. This section also offers detailed information on the summary, key pathways, drug and substrates, important variants and important haplotypes of each gene (Fig. 1). For those who require more specialized information on each gene, quality information is provided by links to the PharmGKB database (www.pharmGKB. org), the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (http://genome. ucsc.edu) and the OMIM at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=omim) sites.Drug Information sectionThe "Drug Information" section was established to provide drug information, based on the drugs provided in the "Pharmacogenomic Information in the drug labels" section. A total of 592 drugs have been arranged in alphabetical order to allow easy access, and the number of relevant drugs is recorded next to each entry. This section also offers detailed information on the molecular weight, indications, mechanisms of action, absorption data, distribution data, protein binding data, biotransformation data, half life, elimination data, adverse effects and interactions of each drug (Fig. 1). Those requiring more specialized information on each drug can obtain it via links to the PharmGKB database (www. pharmGKB.org/) site.Pharmacogenomic Information in the drug labels sectionThe "Pharmacogenomic Information in the drug labels" section was established to provide information on the use of pharmacogenomic data in drug labels and relabels in Korea and foreign countries. A total of 253 approved drugs have been arranged in alphabetical order to allow easy access, and the number of relevant drugs is recorded next to each entry. This section allows detailed use of the pharmacogenomic data listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference. Through Valid Biomarker (V.B.) information, pharmacogenomic data in the drug labels and relabels in Korea can be compared with those of other regulations (the U.S.A, the U.K and Japan) (Fig. 1).Table 1 shows a detailed comparison of KPD release 1.0 with KPD release 2.0. The latest release of the KPD has detailed information on the SNPs of a total of 719 genes. Comparisons of the SNP frequencies in the Korean population with those of other races registered in the International HapMap database (Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and African) are also provided.   The "haplotype information" section has been also updated to provide information on 10 unique Korean haplotypes. Korean linkage disequilibrium block data for the genes encoding the major metabolic-enzymes is included. The blocks comprise the SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) values 5% using the Gabriel method in the Haploview 3.32 program (Ardlie, Kruglyak and Seielstad 2002; Barrett, Fry, Maller and Daly 2005). The haplotype frequencies of the major liver metabolic-enzymes for the Korean population can be compared with those of other races registered in the International HapMap (Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, and African). In addition, the latest version contains approximately four times as much pharmacogenomic information as the previous release (30 versus 7) through the "Pharmacogenomic Information and Education" facility within the KPD.Discussion.
NIFDS has been operating the KPD with the main aim of offering users a “bridging” function to simplify the search for useful information. The KPD has systematically collected and maintained unique Korean pharmacogenomic information from literatures and other databases and provided scientic reviewers and researchers with the selected data. Since its first release, the KPD has provided data on Korean single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes. It also allows a comparison of the Korean SNP and haplotype frequencies with those of the other ethnic groups registered in the International HapMap (Thorisson, Smith, Krishnan and Stein 2005). The KPD is focused primarily on providing the detailed pharmacogenomic data needed to facilitate drug evaluation. Therefore, in the latest version, three new additions ("Gene Information" section, "Drug Information" section and "Pharmacogenomic information in the drug labels" section) were established, and the data coverage and database linkages were expanded to provide more practical pharmacogenomic information for drug evaluations. These new additions provide scientific reviewers and the general public with the concise information needed to understand ethnic differences and evaluate bridging studies. It is also expected to be useful for finding unique Korean Pharmacogenomic data without the need to search other databases. The KPD contains extensive links to almost all major bioinformatics and pharmacogenomic databases (the dbSNP and OMIM at NCBI, PharmGKB and UCSC sites) (Karolchik et al., 2008; Kuhn et al., 2007; Kuhn et al., 2009; Wheeler et al., 2008). Through these links, the KPD provides convenient search functions to obtain more precise information with just a single mouse click.What is the most important thing is to update the database with the lastst pharcogenomic data on a constant basis in order to maintain the KPD effectively. Local expert organizations and networks are needed to guarantee the reliability of the pharmacogenomic information contained in the database. In order to ensure that the KPD is used effectively by scientific reviewers and the general public, the types of visitors to the site must be assessed and the database must be upgraded periodically to reflect the demands of the major visiting population. Overall, it is expected that the KPD will serve as a useful resource to both scientific reviewers and the general public.system or the source code for possible collaboration.OOverview of the System.
CAD (Computer-Aided Design) has been traditionally used to assist in modeling in various fields, and advances in the biological community have created new uses for CAD with many novel biomedical applications (Demir et al., 2002; Holford et al., 2005; Sorokin et al., 2006; Sun, 2005). Especially, CAD can be a visualization gateway to gather numerous biological pathway resources, not only from biological pathway databases but also from static images and research articles.  The PPE (Pyrus Pathway Editor) system, a Java- based visual tool for drawing and annotating biological pathways, is described in this paper. It is a graphical editor for biological pathways, and it integrates the pathway image and XML file source. Fig. 1 shows a snapshot of the PPE system.  The PPE window contains a menu bar, tool bar, status bar, and a progress bar at the top of the screen. Windows can be dragged around the screen and resized. The tool bar contains tools for making selections, for zooming and scrolling images, and for changing the drawing color. The status bar, when the cursor is over an image, displays pixel coordinates and values. The progress bar shows the progress of time- consuming operations. PPE provides several common visual notations but also allows the user to define his own notations. The shape menu in the left window, in Fig. 1, can be used to select the shapes of the biological nodes. Users can annotate map elements with biological information or link them to external databases. The File/Import submenu provides access to plug-ins for reading XML files and for loading images. Thus, maps can be drawn in several modes.  First, they can be imported from external XML file sources and laid out in the editor window, as in Fig. 1. In the case that layout information is not provided in the XML file, an automatic layout module will be applied to display biological pathways.  Second, it allows a user to import external image sources, process the image, convert the processed image into an XML format, and finally generate maps in the editor window. The File/Open command opens TIFF, GIF, and JPEG images. There are some excellent image sources, ranging from image pathway databases, such as KEGG (http://www.kegg.org/) and BioCARTA (http:// www.biocarta.com), to images in numerous biological textbooks, research papers, and websites. These external images are initially displayed in additional windows below the main editing window, as in Fig. 2a. They will be semiautomatically processed, converted into an XML format, and displayed in the main editing window, as in Fig. 2b. Each node and edge in the original image has to be confirmed by a user, one by one; double-clicking on any line or image nodes in the bottom window will result in the Object in the editor window. By selecting an appropriate node type from the pop-up window, the user can create a new object in the main window. The types and shapes of nodes are predefined. The node types include protein-node, chemical compound-node, DNA-node, RNA-node, enzyme- node, and others. In addition, users can define their own node type. By selecting the exact concept from the pop-up menu, the user can specify an  appropriate edge type, too.Discussion and Future Direction.
KEGG and BioCARTA visualize pathways in a static way. Pathway diagrams are manually drawn and stored as bitmap image files. While this visualization style offers good pathway representation, it does not provide the facilities to create and visualize dynamic pathways. Fortunately, KEGG also provides XML files. In the case that layout information is not provided in the XML file, an automatic layout module will be applied to display biological pathways. However, there are cases in which XML files are not provided in many other databases. In this case, we have to convert an image file directly to an XML file.  In this paper, a computer-aided approach to modify biological pathways, both in image and XML file format, is presented. To the best of our knowledge, we have not found any attempt to process biological pathway images within the CAD environment. However, there are some thorny issues that need to be solved to fully automate this process. Especially, an optical character recognition module should be added in the future to recognize characters in the image. Currently, the characters in the original images are filtered out, and the names and types of each node are manually annotated by humans in a later process, as in Fig. 3. Once the characters can be recognized, the naming process of each node, by human intervention, can be fully automated in the majority of cases.References.
The pathway editor: a tool for managing complex biological networks. IBM J. Res. Dev. 50, 561-573. 3D space offers less constraints on the topology and helps to avoid such unaesthetic graph elements as line crossing. The extra dimension gives greater flexibility for placing nodes and edges in the network.   Despite all these merits, only a few tools offer three-dimensional visualizations. The problem is that, the resultant 3D images of computer graphics are rendered in a 2D media. Therefore, making use of higher dimensions is rather difficult for users generally viewing the network on a two-dimensional screen.  An alternative approach to three-dimensional graph visualization would be to present only interesting subtrees in different layers, originated from the basic 2D graph visualization. This scheme helps when there is a possibility to group multiple nodes to a hyper-node to reduce complexity as well as to hide nodes that are not of interest.   This paper presents a visual Java-based tool for drawing and annotating biological pathways in two- and-a-half-dimensions (2.5D) as an alternative to the existing two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) presentations, where two and a half dimension is an informal term used to describe visual phenomena which is actually 2D with 3D looking graphics (Baur et al., 2004; Song et al., 2009). Such visualization allows user to see a detailed view of an objects in focus and its place in the context of the whole system.J2.5dPathway Browser Architecture.
The J2.5DPathway Browser Tool is a tool that hierarchically lists the pathways and super nodes. The system provides a visual interface to biomedical pathways. It is basically a graph visualization tool. An XML-format input data may come from web services (e.g., KEGG: http:// www.genome.jp/kegg/soap/) after the user chooses to view the selected pathway from the J2.5DPathway, or it may come from other file formats, which were locally saved.   J2.5DPathway consists of four major modules: (1) graphical user interface (GUI), (2) two-dimensional representation, (3) two-and-a-half dimensional representation, and (4) layout optimizer. The layout optimizer module permits user to optimize the appearance of a graph. Implemented data structures are based on an ontology model designed specifically for metabolic pathways.  The GUI module comprises of a set of tools for facilitating interaction between the system and the user (see Fig. 2). The screen of J2.5dPathway system consists of Views. The tool-bar menu at the top lists various tool icons. Most of the functions of the tool icons are self-explanatory. For example, clicking the Magnifying Glass tool manipulates the View to zoom in or out. Pathways will be initially displayed in the main window in the middle. Below the main window, a table lists all the nodes in the pathways. The interested nodes can be selected, by clicking the elements in the table. To allow user to view several different groups of nodes, selected nodes will be displayed in different parallel planes, however with interdependent layouts. In the case user wants to create a new plane, he or she may set the plane number to a value greater than one.  Alternatively, a feature of selecting nodes of interest is also available by clicking and dragging a rectangular or circular area on the 2D plane. This is possible because J2.5dPathway is an extended version of J2dPathway (Song et al., 2008).  J2dPathway has a feature to select arbitrary nodes and abstracts them into a single node. One can select several nodes by dragging the mouse and turn them into a single super node. These abstracted nodes are displayed in a different plane, in a consequent process.   For example, the selected nodes (the red nodes) in Fig. 3 are abstracted into a single super node (Song et al., 2008) in J2dPathway environment. However, the selected nodes in the original 2D visualization are displayed in a different plane in J2.5dPathway environment. The transformed two-and-a-half dimensional representation and the original two dimensional representations are basically consistent with each other.Implementation.
Our application was developed based on Java 3D classes and methods, importing from javax.media.j3d (see Fig. 4). It is implemented based on Java 3D API (http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/java3d/) and OpenGL (http://www.opengl.org/about/overview/) technologies, the premier environment for developing portable, interactive 3D graphics applications. To run the J2.5dPathway system, the graph library yFiles should be also installed on user’s local computer (Wiese et al., 2000). local database features for saving and searching the searched results. Users can import and update the major databases with Windows interfaces and can manipulate their own local databases with searched results.Features and Results.
The detailed features of WinBioDBs are as follows.  Windows program   supporting the search of 10 major biological databases (Table 1) including large databases like GenBank  searching and formatting the results  local databases for the searched results  editing and searching local databases  customization of search conditions for each database  customization of output fields for each database  project features - multiple local databases  updating public DB  backup of local databases  The database schema of WinBioDBs is a little complicated (Fig. 1) to support the complicated features (Fig. 2). Database information table is a meta table and each of 10 major public databases constructs a public DB table and a private DB table.Discussion.
WinBioDB is a Windows program with diverse and unique features as a PC-based program. With more practical requirements through user tests, it will be upgraded to a more useful database program. It could include more public databases and could be integrated with analysis programs.  As WinBioDBs use MySQL as its database engine, the server version programs can be easily constructed by just changing the database server while using its Windows interfaces.References.

Some programs such as PCR Suite (van Baren, 2004) and BatchPrimer3 (You, 2004) provide user-friendly Primer3 interfaces including web-based environment. Some programs have been developed for designing very specific primers (Moro, 2009). iCODEHOP (Boyce, 2009) uses multialignment result from ClustalW. Genomemasker (Andreson, 2006) and UniPrime (Boutros, 2009) treat genome sequences for primer design.  We have developed COCAW (Comparative Observer for Conserved Areas among Whole genomes), which has web interfaces for the input of multiple genomes and the output of graphical display of detected conserved regions.Overview of the System.
Fig.1 shows the general algorithm of COCAW. Common k-mer patterns are detected in genomes as seed patterns for finding out the candidates of conserved pair regions. To select comparison regions instead of com-paring whole genomes, the information entropy for each k-mer is calculated against whole genomes. After selecting the regions to be compared based on the information entropy, local alignment is calculated to detect final conserved pair regions.  Fig. 2 shows the main web interface of COCAW. Inputs are (a)(d) including a reference genome, compared genomes, the comparison range of the reference genome, and tolerance value of the information entropy comparison. And the detected conserved regions are displayed at (e)(f). The right shot shows an example of the summary of the searched result, where one genome has a similar region with the reference genome and no similar regions are found between the reference genome and other genomes.  Fig. 3 shows the running time analysis of COCAW. X-axis indicates the number of genomes and Y-axis indicates the running time. And multiple plots for error cutoffs of information entropy are displayed. While the running time increases rapidly by the number of compared genomes, it is still very practical for conserved region analysis of species and genus.Discussion.
COCAW is a tool for scanning multiple genomes for conserved regions and it could be useful for genome-wide detection of the patterns as probes among a group of genomes. Currently it shows the detected conserved regions with a little graphical interface, and it will be upgraded for more practical and informational interface especially for multiple genome processing.  COCAW finds out conserved regions among multiple genomes. As a group-specific pattern is an exclusively conserved region, it is not only conserved in the group but also should not be in other genomes. So for detecting very strict group specific patterns, more complicated and time-consuming processes are additionally required.  More practical algorithms should be developed for massive number of genomes with practical user interfaces for diverse applications.References.

The number of repeats is in the range of 5-35 in the normal population, and DM alleles harbor more than 50 and up to several thousand repeats in DM1 patients. The pathogenesis of DM1 is directly mediated by a toxic mDMPK RNA that is entrapped in the affected cell nucleus. A number of pieces of evidence suggest that pleiotropic effects of aberrant interactions between the mDMPK transcripts that are retained in the nucleus and RNA- binding proteins, such as muscleblind-like 1, change the metabolism of target mRNAs, including splicing (Wheeler, 2008). Additively, decreased DMPK protein levels in DM1 patients due to loss of cytoplasm-localized mRNA for translation could cause physiological and functional alterations in phosphorylation of target proteins, including CUG-binding protein 1, and hence has been suggested as a contributor to the pathology of the disease (Kaliman and Llagostera, 2008).   There is no cure for DM yet. However, several approaches to reduce the mutant RNA-mediated toxicity through elimination of nucleus-trapped toxic mDMPK transcripts have been proposed as specific therapies for reversal of the disease phenotype. They include approaches with antisense, small catalytic RNA, or siRNA, which can reduce the level of mDMPK RNA by directly targeting the expanded CUG repeats of the mDMPK transcript (Furling et al., 2003; Krol et al., 2007; Langlois et al., 2003; Mahadevan et al., 2006). However, high specificity for degradation of the mutant alleles, nontoxicity, and lack of off-target effects will be required to minimize nonspecific reduction of the normal allele and cellular toxicity. RNA repair or RNA replacement has been described as a new approach to human gene therapy against genetic disorders, which relies on the Tetrahymena group I-based trans-splicing ribozyme (Sullenger and Gilboa, 2002). This ribozyme could cleave a target 5-exon RNA and trans-ligate an exon that is tagged at its 3-end onto the cleaved target RNA both in vitro and in bacteria and mammalian cells (Been and Cech, 1986; Sullenger and Cech, 1994; Jones et al., 2006). Therefore, the trans-splicing ribozyme can reduce the level of a specific target RNA and simultaneously induce transgene activity specifically in the target RNA- expressing cells. Indeed, trans-splicing ribozymes have been successfully developed to replace mutant transcripts that are associated with several human genetically inherited diseases, including DM1 (Lan et al., 1998; Phylactou et al. 1998; Rogers et al., 2002). Moreover, we have shown that trans-splicing ribozyme targeting and replacing the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) RNA could specifically and efficiently regress human tumors not only in cell cultures but also in animals without any toxicity in normal tissues or any off-target splicing effects (Hong et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2008; Kwon et al., 2005; Song and Lee, 2008; Song et al., 2009). Thus, a trans-splicing ribozyme that can repair toxic mDMPK RNA with the wild-type one or replace the nucleus-entrapped mutant transcripts with RNA that can be released into the cytoplasm would be a potential tool for DM1 treatment. To this end, we have developed mDMPK 3-UTR-specific trans-splicing ribozymes by utilizing an RNA mapping procedure that identifies the most accessible ribozyme sites.  Any uridine (U) residue in a target RNA can be targeted for splicing by the trans-splicing ribozyme through alteration of the internal guide sequence (IGS), which is the 5-exon binding site of the ribozyme, to make it complementary to the target sequence (Long et al., 2003; Sullenger, 1995). However, the ribozyme can actually access only a limited number of uridines on the target RNA due to complicated tertiary structure formation of the substrate RNA (Lan et al., 2000). To develop most potential mDMPK 3-UTR-specific ribozymes, therefore, identification of the regions of the target transcript that are accessible to ribozymes should be performed first. To this end, we employed an RNA mapping strategy based on RNA tagging (Jones et al.,1996) and a trans- splicing ribozyme library, which has been described in detail elsewhere (Fig. 1) (Lan et al., 1998; Lan et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 2005; Ryu et al., 2003; Song and Lee, 2007).  We constructed the GN5 ribozyme library, which is based on the Tetrahymena group I intron and contains a randomized IGS. Ribozymes in the GN5 library can bind to the substrate RNA, cleave at any accessible U residue, and transfer a 3-exon that is tagged onto the ribozyme to the end of the cleaved 5-target product. We used a portion of the lacZ gene as a 3-exon molecular tag in the GN5 library. mDMPK 3-UTR RNA was synthesized using in vitro transcription of PCR-amplified vector encoding the mDMPK 3-UTR gene with 200 CTG repeats (kindly supplied by Dr. Leonidas Phylactou at the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics). In order to map the mDMPK 3-UTR RNA, GN5 library RNA (10 nM) was incubated at 37C for 3 hrs under splicing conditions (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl) in the presence of guanosine (200 M) and in vitro-generated target RNA (100 nM). The trans-splicing reaction products were then reverse-transcribed at 37C for 30 min in the presence of argininamide (10 mM) with a 3primer that was specific for the ribozymes 3-exon lacZ sequence (5-ATGTGCTGCAAG GCGATT-3) (Jones et al. 1996). Produced cDNAs were amplified by PCR for 30 cycles using the same 3primer and a 5primer that was specific for the 5-end of the target RNA (5-ACCCTAGAACTGTCTTCGACTCC-3) or downstream region of the expanded CTG sequence (5-GGAATTCGGGGGATCACAGACCAT-3). The amplified trans- splicing products were then cloned into the pUC19 vector, and sequences of several clones were determined.’  When we analyzed sequences of the splicing junction sites of the trans-spliced products amplified with the 5-end of the target RNA as the 5 primer, several uridines, only in the upstream of the expanded trinucleotide repeat sequence, appeared to be particularly accessible (Fig. 2). Long hairpin structures of the expanded trinucleotide repeat might hamper PCR amplification of trans-spliced products that result from the splicing reaction with U residues downstream of the trinucleotide repeat sequence. To identify accessible U residues in the target RNA that were present downstream of the trinucleotide repeat, we also amplified trans-splicing products with the 5primer that was specific for right downstream part of the trinucleotide repeat sequence. Then, several uridines downstream of the expanded CUG repeat sequence were also shown to be particularly accessible. In conclusion, the most accessible site upstream of the CUG repeat sequence was located in the uridine at position 99 of the mDMPK 3-UTR RNA. In addition, the uridine at position 854 of the target RNA was the most accessible site that was present downstream of the CUG repeat. Interestingly, most of the accessible sites, including positions 99 and 854, which were identified using this mapping method, were generally present in the loop or bulge region of the RNAs secondary structure, as predicted by a computer program (Fig. 2). In contrast, no accessible sites were found in the long hairpin-formed CUG repeat region. In previous studies, we showed that the relative trans-splicing reaction efficacy at different sites in a target RNA in cells and in vitro was closely associated with the predicted accessibility determined by mapping results (Ryu et al., 2003; Ryu and Lee, 2004; Kwon et al., 2005). Therefore, the ribozymes that target the ac-
