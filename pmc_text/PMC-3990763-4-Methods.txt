Interactive visualization
The microarray automated data analysis produced a similarity space of the patients based on their genetic properties. A mapping table of 250 GOI is also created during this process. In order to present these results in a form suitable for visual analysis by medical experts, we have created interactive visualizations that operate with the treated data. The interactive visualization is applied to 1) present a flexible, changeable, and meaningful display of the patient cohort; 2) filter, explore, and manipulate the information; and 3) interactively provide the details of both the original and processed data on demand. Details of the interactive visualization components are presented as follows.
