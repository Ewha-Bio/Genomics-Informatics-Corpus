Data description
For GWAS, we used Ansan-Anseong cohort data. These were for a study of a chronic diseases within Ansan city and Anseong rural areas in Korea. The dataset comprised men (8,842 people) between 40–69 years of age who had been residents of the region for at least 6 months [12,13]. Our study was from the 3rd Ansan-Anseong cohort dataset version 2.1. The analyzed phenotypes were BF% unit and the covariates were set to be area, age and sex. The SNP dataset was implemented using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mean call rate was 99.01%. The total number of SNPs was 352,228 and after quality control (minor allele frequency < 0.05, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-value < 0.0001 and missing genotype rate > 0.05), 308,003 SNPs were left.
For transcript reads, we used transcript reads per million (TPM) data at the following website (http://www.proteinatlas.org). The Human Protein Atlas was released with protein profile data covering 48 different human tissues and organs, including adipocytes, the kidney and the liver [14,15]. Among these organs, we used adipocyte’s transcript reads data. The TPM data of the Human Protein atlas is based on the reads per gene. Thus the gene length was pre-considered for the accurate reads estimation per gene.
