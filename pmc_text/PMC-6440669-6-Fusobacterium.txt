Fusobacterium was found to be abundant in both healthy and metritic cows by metagenomic analysis [10, 22, 23]. Nonetheless, it showed the correlation with uterine discharge score and interaction with abundance of Bacteroides [23], which implies that Fusobacterium is involved in development of metritis. Particularly, Fusobacterium necrophorum is a well-known pathogen related to uterine disease in dairy cows, as has been ascertained in culture-[45], PCR-[33], and sequencing-based studies (Table 1). The key virulence factor of F. necrophorum includes leukotoxin that is cytotoxic to immune cells specifically in cattle and sheep, and protects them against phagocytosis by neutrophils [46, 47]; despite F. necrophorum being well-studied, pathogenicity of bovine uterine isolates has not yet been investigated. F. necrophorum appeared to be present with other pathogens such as T. pyogenes and P. levii, suggesting a synergistic role of causing uterine disease [44, 45]. Similarly, the coexistence of Fusobacterium with Bacteroides and Porphyromonas was observed in the blood and uterus of dairy cows by network analysis [34]. Therefore, pathogenicity of F. necrophorum in the uterus may be attributed to interactions with other bacteria.
