Limit of mutation detection
To verify the limit of detection, we used the Quantitative Multiplex Reference Standard DNA (Horizon Discovery) sample, which contains 11 variants with variant allele frequencies (VAFs) ranging from 1% to 24.5%. We diluted the reference DNA from 100% to 10% and sequenced it with OncoChase-AS. The limit of detection and correlation between the expected and observed VAFs were calculated as described [14]. Correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis was performed using R.
