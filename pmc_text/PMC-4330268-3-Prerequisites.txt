Mutation calling files from Genome Analysis ToolKit [11] can be used directly as input files for 'Sample Descriptor.' Alternatively, manually prepared standard Variant Call Format [13] is also available. Annotation information files, such as ANNOVAR outputs, can be used as input files for Sample Descriptor. GSF is a comma-separated values text file that describes the input files, such as GATK output files and ANNOVAR output files, and phenotype information. MAP imports this Sample Descriptor file as the input file. Details are available in the user manual.
