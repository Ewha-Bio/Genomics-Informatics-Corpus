Correlation between protein compositional features and the expression levels
Our data indicated that different amino acids including Arg, Asp, Lys, Glu, Gln, Ser, and Ile have significant correlations with the expression level of genes in 15, 14, 12, 11, 11, 9, and 8 tissues respectively (Supplementary Table 5). Among these notable amino acids, Asp and Lys have the most significant positive correlation coefficients. So, a bar plot was drawn by R software for these amino acids in order to identify the tissues in which both Asp and Lys have significant correlation coefficients with gene expression level (Fig. 3).
