Genetic value prediction and SNP-GBLUP
The result of the genetic value prediction is shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 1A, G-BLUP; Fig. 1B, SNP-BLUP; Fig. 1C, SNP-GBLUP). These results show the genetic value variances are nearly identical between G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP. However, SNP-BLUP is very disparate from the other two BLUPs. Fig. 2 shows the histogram of SNP random effects (Fig. 2A, SNP-BLUP; Fig. 2B, SNP-GBLUP). Both cases indicate that the SNP effects in both BLUPs are distributed normally and that they suit the normal assumption of SNP effects. However, the result of the genetic values was very different in both cases, as shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1. Supplementary Table 1 shows the height phenotype and the genetic value prediction of the three BLUPs. G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP showed identical results. The estimated residual error variance was 21.39 in the three BLUP cases. The fixed effect was 166.6 (men) and 153.3 (women) in both G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP and 167.4 (men) and 154.1 (women) in SNP-BLUP.
