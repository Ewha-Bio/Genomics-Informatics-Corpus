Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)
Gene accession numbers, fold-changes of each treatment, and p-value were loaded into the IPA5.0 software (http://www.ingenuity.com). The genes were grouped with their molecular functions and depicted as a network picture, with their direct and indirect relationships represented with the gene ontology by the canonical pathway analysis. All these annotations used Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway maps, and the most significant genes were summarized in the network and as a graph.
