Systemic sclerosis
In a recent miRNA study [9], serum samples of systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients (n = 26) were screened for 758 miRNAs, of which 30 miRNAs were identified as differentially upregulated miRNAs. Among these 30 miRNAs, miR-483-5p showed higher expression level in an independent SSc cohort, especially in early stages of SSc. The miRNA was also up-regulated in localized scleroderma, but not in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or primary SjS (pSjS), indicating that this miRNA possibly contributes to the development of skin fibrosis. Furthermore, functional assays involving miR-483-5p overexpression in fibroblasts and endothelial cells revealed altered expression of fibrosis-related genes. This provides strong evidence that the serum miRNA miR-483-5p may function as a potential regulator of fibrosis in SSc.
