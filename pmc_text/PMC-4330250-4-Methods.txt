NGS data analysis
We downloaded previously published whole-genome NGS data from the TIARA database, sequenced at Seoul National University College of Medicine (TIARA; http://tiara.gmi.ac.kr) [14]. The short reads from seven samples (AK3, AK4, AK5, AK6, AK7, AK14, and AK20) were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) using the alignment algorithm in Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program (GSNAP) [15]. From the resulting BAM file, we selected the mapped reads within the LD blocks that encompassed the significant SNPs from the BMI GWA result using the Samtools view function [16], creating a separate BAM file for each LD block.
