Logistic regression
The strength of the association between dose-related CNS ADR patients and the presence of the G allele at the g.-1774 region was evaluated as the odds ratio (OR) obtained with logistic regression analysis (SPSS version 11.5). ORs were adjusted for gender, age, HS, use of AEDs (larmotrigene, CBZ, PHT, and topiramate), and the presence of the G allele at the g.-1774 promoter region.
