Our ultimate goal of sharing the dataset is to offer a shared task of rice gene/protein NER, through the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST) framework, to facilitate open comparison and evaluation of various approaches to the task. Toward the goal, we will further upload remaining annotation data, while keeping some portion of it hidden for test dataset.
