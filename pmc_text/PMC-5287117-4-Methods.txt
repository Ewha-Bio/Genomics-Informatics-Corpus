Statistical analysis
For the joint identification of disease susceptibility variants among a large number of SNPs, we extracted SNPs having a strong correlation with T2D via logistic regression for single-variant analysis and collected the list of reported SNPs from a GWAS catalog [34]. Then, we implemented a 3-stage procedure as follows: the first stage was variable selection using SLR, LASSO, and EN. The second stage was the construction of risk prediction models. The third stage was evaluation of the risk prediction models through both internal validation and external validation.
