Effective population size (Ne) is the theoretically useful population size of an ideal population, in which the influence of random genetic drift is identical to that of the actual population [1]. Therefore, the effective population size is a good representative of the genetic potential of the actual population; yet, it is easier to handle population genetic problems. There are several kinds of effective population size, depending on the focus of measurement [2, 3, 4, 5], and the most representative ones are the inbreeding effective population size, the variance effective population size, and the eigenvalue effective population size. The variance effective population is easy conceptually, and it can be estimated based on the gene (or allele) frequencies [6, 7] or heterozygote excess [8]. In addition, the estimation can be based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) [9], and advanced related methods based on LD have been applied to human genome data to infer the past population history of human populations [10, 11, 12].
Recently, new methods have been developed to estimate the current Ne and recent changes in Ne [13, 14]. In studies, the effective population size of the current generation was estimated based on deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and an effective population size of recent generations was estimated using the linkage equilibrium (LE) between variants in different chromosomes [13]. The past population changes can be inferred from the LD decay, depending on recombination rate [14]. Different from previous methods using regressive methods [10, 11, 12], the relationship between the effective population size of the previous generation and that of the current generation [14] was presented by improving a recurrence formula of previous studies [15, 16]. The applications of these studies to human genome data showed excellent agreement with the actual recent changes of various human populations [13, 14].
HapMap Phase III data were used for studies to infer the past population histories of various human populations. There were similar data for Korean populations (the Korean HapMap data) [17, 18]; however, for the continuity of the results, the data were not included for the analyses in previous studies [13, 14]. In 2007, right after the Korean HapMap data, the Korea Association Resource (KARE) was initiated to enable genomewide analyses for 8,842 individuals from the population-based cohorts [19]. The effort was successful in revealing new and population-specific genetic factors of various traits [19, 20, 21, 22]. The KARE data were also provided to many other researchers, which yielded many novel findings [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]. In the current study, the current and recent effective population sizes of Koreans were estimated, and the past changes in effective population sizes were studied using the KARE data. Different from the HapMap data, the KARE data contain many more individuals with their age information. In addition to the analyses of the total population, region-specific and age-specific analyses were conducted in the current study.
