Protein structure prediction
(PS)2 (pronounced PS square) was used for the prediction of the tertiary structures of HPs (http://www.ps2.life.nctu.edu.tw/). This method combined PSI-BLAST [22,23], IMPALA [24], and T-Coffee [25] by using an effective accord strategy in both target-template selection and target-template alignment. Three dimensional structures were constructed further using the modeling package MODELLER [26,27,28]. The predicted structures obtained from the PS square were saved in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) formats.
