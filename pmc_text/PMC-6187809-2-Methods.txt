Primary and matched PDX tumor samples
CRC tissues and matched normal samples were collected from three CRC patients at Seoul St. Maryâ€™s Hospital (Seoul, Korea) with the approval of the institutional review board. Corresponding PDX tissues of the xenograft mouse models from the same cases were obtained with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Catholic University of Korea (Seoul, Korea). General information on the three CRC cases (normal, primary tumor, and PDX tissue sets) is available in Supplementary Table 1. Primary tumor samples were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The H&E-stained slides were reviewed by a pathologist to mark tumor cell-rich areas and used as a guide for the microdissections. DNA was extracted from the microdissected tissue and matched blood using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA was quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit on a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
