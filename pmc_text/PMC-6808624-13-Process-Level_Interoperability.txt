PubAnnotation ↔ LAPPS Grid
Documents from PubAnnotation are made available in the LAPPS Grid as data sources, that is, services that provide documents for processing by other services. Documents are retrieved from PubAnnotation using their PubMed ID number. Currently, the LAPPS Grid does not provide any search or query mechanisms for PubAnnotation, and therefore users must determine document ID numbers via other means–for example, by using the PubAnnotation search facility (http://pubannotation.org/search) or the LAPPS Grid AskMe service (https://services.lappsgrid.org/eager/ask). The documents may be downloaded from PubAnnotation as text documents with no annotations or with annotations from PubAnnotation projects included (if available). Annotated documents can also be sent back to the PubAnnotation platform for publication and alignment with the canonical text, so that the annotations are available along with all other published annotations of the same text for others to use.
Several LAPPS Grid services are also made available as annotators on the PubAnnotation platform, so that documents may be annotated directly on the PubAnnotation web site. The tools specifically tuned to biomedical data that are currently available from the LAPPS Grid include:
• Abner biomedical named entity recognizer
• PennBio gene tagger
• TimeML time and event annotator
• Tokenizer and part of speech tagger from Stanford CoreNLP
