A list of somatic mutations
After removal of SNPs and indels from dbSNP137 [6] and an in-house Korean database, 27 somatic mutations (NS/SS/I) were discovered from 8 samples. Among them, NPM1 showed a TCTG internal tandem insertion. NPM1-ITD is known to be major driver gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 7). NPM1-ITD and GATA2 were recurrently found in two samples. We had removed all variants from dbSNP and an in-house Korean database that showed polymorphisms or normal variants, because they can be putatively functionally neutral, even if they are discovered as somatic mutations.
We had downloaded the COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) database and compared with our somatic mutations. We found the same highly recurrent somatic mutation variants in four genes: NPM1, IDH2, CEBPA, and GATA2.
In 26 genes, we can easily see the NPM1, IDH2, GATA2, CEBPA genes-known to be highly mutated in AML [3]. Based on the recent somatic mutation profiles from exome sequencing, one can see the following trends of them. In solid tumors, somatic mutation in TP53 is high. But in melanoma, BRAF mutation is high. In hepatocellular carcinoma, CTNNB1 mutation is high. It means that somatic mutations can play a different role, depending on cancer. In AML, other than the well-known TP53 mutation, genes, such as FLT3, TET2, and NPM1, show somatic mutations and are the driver genes [7].
