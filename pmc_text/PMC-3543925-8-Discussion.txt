Oxidative stress due to excess production of ROS is one of the reasons for the development of hypertension [4]. To identify genetic risk factors that induce hypertension through ROS, this study extracted ROS-hypertension-related genes using text-mining tools and investigated the association of genes with hypertension in 6,419 unrelated Koreans. MAPK8, PROM1, and KDR had strong association signals with hypertension (p < 4 × 10-4). Especially, MAPK8 was published 13 times in ROS-hypertension articles, while most genes strongly associated with hypertension (p < 0.01) were published an average of 6.29 times.
MAPK8, known as JNK1, included 19 SNPs in the KARE genotype data, and 14 SNPs among the 19 SNPs were significantly associated with hypertension, ranging in p-value from 2.7 × 10-5 to 1.3 × 10-3-moderate in comparison with a genome-wide association study (GWAS)-significant p-value (5.0 × 10-8); thus MAPK8 was not considered as the candidate gene of hypertension in previous GWAS studies [15, 16]. MAPK8 plays a key role in T cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation through the studies of Jnk1-deficient mice [17, 18]. MAPK8 was included on HumanCVD Beadchip, a customized cardiovascular disease (CVD) SNP chip containing more than 2,100 CVD candidate genes [19]. However, previous cardiovascular disease GWASs regarding high-density lipoprotein particle features, lipids, and apolipoproteins did not report the association of the MAPK8 gene [20, 21]. Therefore, it needs replication to make it sure whether MAPK8 is indeed involved in the development of hypertension through ROS.
Using the text-mining tool, we found 237 ROS-hypertension-related genes. The most frequent gene was AGT (angiotensinogen [serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 8]), which was reported on 320 ROS-hypertension articles, but it was not associated with hypertension in this study or our previous report [22]. Most of the genes that were published in more than 40 articles were not associated with hypertension or showed weak associations; 6 of 17 genes were significant, and the lowest p-value was 0.014 (nitric oxide synthase 1 [neuronal], NOS1). The average number of articles for genes with strong signals (p < 0.01) was 6.29 articles, and that for those with moderate signals (0.01 ≤ p < 0.05) was 18.90 articles.
Two large GWASs, the International Consortium for Blood Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies (IC-BPGWAS) [23] and Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network Blood Pressure (AGEN-BP) [16], reported 33 blood pressure candidate loci in 2011. Among 66 genes within the 33 blood pressure candidate loci, 6 genes were included in the ROS-hypertension gene set as follows: NPPA, NPPB, PTPN11, CYP1A1, GNAS, and EDN3. We examined their association with hypertension by case control study, and NPPA, NPPB, and CYP1A1 were associated with hypertension with p < 0.05. The weakly associated SNP rs1023252 (p = 0.047) overlapped with NPPA and NPPB, and rs2472299 within the CYP1A1 locus was previously mentioned for the oxidative stress pathway from WikiPathway (http://www.wikipathways.org).
In conclusion, we listed ROS-hypertension genes that were extracted by a text-mining approach and tested their association with hypertension in Korean population. Several genes, including the MAPK8 gene, were identified as potential genes causing hypertension through ROS. This study demonstrates that a text-mining approach combined with association analysis may be useful to identify candidate genes that cause hypertension through ROS or oxidative stress.
