Gene set analyses
We performed GSA using the Gene Ontology (GO) databases, where only gene sets having 10-200 members (2,476 biological process GO terms) were used. We applied the Z-statistic method, as implemented in GSA-SNP [10], with the default options. Briefly, those SNPs residing inside or within 20 kb of the boundary of each gene were compiled, and the second best p-value was assigned to the gene. See Kwon et al. [11] for the rationale of using the second best p-value instead of the best p-value. The gene score was defined as the -log of the p-value assigned to the gene. The Z-statistic was then calculated for each gene set [10]. The p-values for each gene set were computed under the assumption of a normal distribution of the Z-statistic, followed by multiple testing correction using the false discovery rate method. When the member genes of a gene set overlapped in their genomic loci or were located in tandem within a short block of strong linkage disequilibrium, the p-values assigned to them might have been highly correlated. In such cases, only one of them was included to calculate the gene set score.
