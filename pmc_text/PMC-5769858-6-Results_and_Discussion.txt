We predicted the 3D structures of 13 artificial models of proinsulin using I-TASSER (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, different leader peptides affected the overall structure of proinsulin. Especially, although the sequences of models 1 and 2 had only a 1-residue difference, the predicted positions of the leader peptides were quite different.
To refine the predicted structures, we observed the changes in structures by MD simulation at 3 ns to minimize energy. The structures after the MD simulation were superimposed onto the original structures by I-TASSER (Fig. 2). All potential energies of models were kept relatively stable (Fig. 3). The predicted structures were little refined; thus, they were naturally favorable. The total energy and potential energy of models 3 and 8 were the lowest. Among the models tested before (Table 1), no correlation between refolding yields and energies was observed.
Preproinsulin should be refolded and cleaved to become mature insulin. A previous work showed that trypsin could be used as an efficient protease in the maturation of insulin [7]. To investigate how the leader peptide affects the binding mode between proinsulin and trypsin, in silico docking was carried out by InterEVDock [19].
Interestingly, in the docked structure (Fig. 4), the active sites (histidine 57, aspartate 102, and serine 195) of trypsin were located near lysine 64 and arginine 65 of proinsulin, which is the exact position where the first cleavage of proinsulin occurs to release chain A. Binding affinities were also predicted by InterEVDock (Table 2). Among all docked structures, models 1 and 2 were predicted to have the strongest binding affinities.
Because multiple steps of cleavage are needed for maturation, we performed additional protein docking of trypsin to model structures whose C-terminal chain after residue 64 (A chain) was cleaved out. As a result of this step, the preferable position for the active sites of trypsin were located near arginine 31 and arginine 32, which are known to form a cleavage site between the B and C chains. The binding affinities of the models were predicted to be strong (in descending order): model 2, 3, and 1. The two docking steps for artificial proinsulin models into trypsin revealed leader peptides that did not affect the order of cleavage sites, and models 1 and 2 are likely to be best accessed by trypsin in producing mature insulin. This coincides with previously tested refolding yields [7].
In summary, using 13 artificial models of leader peptides of proinsulin, we predicted the structures of fused proinsulins, the structures were refined by MD simulation, and protein-protein docking revealed binding modes between the artificial models and trypsin. The energies of the predicted structures of the models were not related to refolding yields, but the docking energies between the protease and the models showed some relation. We expect these analyses to provide basic information in a structural context for more effective production of insulin.
