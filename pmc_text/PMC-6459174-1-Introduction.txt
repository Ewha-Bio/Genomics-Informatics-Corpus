Athletic performance is a complex multifactorial trait affected by genetic and environmental factors [1]. Genetic factors are particularly known to contribute to strength, endurance, power, and aerobic capacity [2]. A twin study reported the heritability of an athlete status as 70% [3]. To date, at least 155 genetic markers are known to be related to the athlete status [2]. ACE gene is the first reported genetic marker associated with athletic performance and known to regulate vasoconstriction [4]. Previous studies reported an association between ACE enzyme activity and endurance performance [5, 6]. ACTN3 is the most studied genetic marker; the XX genotype of ACTN3 R577X polymorphism has a complete deficiency of Î±-actinin-3 [7]. Several studies reported the association of the RR genotype of ACTN3 with sprint performance, whereas the XX genotype reportedly contributed to endurance performance [7-10]. However, despite several genetic approaches, the effect of genetic markers on athletic performance has not yet been fully understood [2].
Aerobic capacity reportedly plays an important role in endurance performance [11]. Additionally, aerobic capacity has been shown to be inherited maternally rather than paternally [12]. Mitochondria are subcellular organelles that generate 36 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), whereas two ATP molecules are produced through glycolysis [13]. Mitochondria have their own maternally inherited circular DNA (mtDNA), which is approximately 16,569 bp in size. It encodes 13 OXPHOS, two rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes [14]. Because mtDNA is haploid, it does not undergo recombination [15]. Therefore, the human population can be defined as a pool of various haplogroups based on accumulated specific mtDNA polymorphisms, with the polymorphism frequencies differing between populations [16, 17]. Several studies have been conducted in various populations to identify the role of population-specific mtDNA haplogroups on the expression of phenotypes including diseases and longevity [11, 18, 19].
The sprint and endurance ability of athletes is determined by different genetic factors [20]. Aerobic capacity is necessary for endurance performance and is regulated by mitochondrial OXPHOS. Thus, it is believed that mitochondria play an important role in endurance performance [21, 22]. Initial studies used familial studies to report on associations between mtDNA and exercise phenotype [23, 24]. A number of genetic studies have been performed using the mtDNA haplogroup for athlete status and physical performances. The haplogroup H has been reportedly related to higher oxygen consumption and has been associated with athlete status in Finnish and Polish populations [20, 25]. Scott et al. (2009) [26] reported that haplogroup L0 (African specific haplogroup) contributes to physical performance in Kenyan population. Furthermore, the association of haplogroups G1 and F with athlete status in Japanese population has also been reported [27]. Haplogroups M and N9 are involved with athlete status in Korean population [17]. Together, these results suggest that mtDNA haplogroups may play an important factor in athlete status and/or physical performance.
The frequency of mtDNA haplogroups vary among ethnic groups, mainly to differing different genetic backgrounds and environmental factors [12]. This suggests that multiple replication studies are necessary to clarify the role of mtDNA haplogroup in athlete status among independent ethnic groups. Therefore, from Korean population, we recruited a total of 256 college-level subjects (111 athletes and 145 controls) and analyzed the genetic association between 20 mtDNA haplogroups and athlete status as well as physical performance.
