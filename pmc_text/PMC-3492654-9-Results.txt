Association between folate pathway genes and obese gastric cancer patients
Further, the association between the 17 SNPs of folate pathway genes and gastric cancer risk was analyzed and stratified by obesity categories (BMI, <25 vs. â‰¥25) (Table 4).
Interestingly, the risk of rs1801394 was dramatically increased for the codominant model (OR, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 94.59; p < 0.05) only among obese subjects. For the dominant model, the OR was also increased with statistical significance (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.49; p < 0.05). Also, the recessive model showed significantly higher risk (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 0.92 to 16.59). Additionally, we analyzed the correlation among family history, H. pylori infection, and folate gene SNPs but did not find any significant association (data not shown).
