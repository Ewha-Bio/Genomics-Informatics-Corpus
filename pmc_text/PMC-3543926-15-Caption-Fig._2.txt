DNA gel pictures. (A) Genomic DNA amplification by rolling-circle amplification for Prebiocide and Tank A drinking water samples. Lane M, 5 kb DNA ladder; lane 1, Prebiocide DNA product; lane 2, negative control (no Φ29 DNA polymerase); lane 3, Tank A DNA product; lane 4, positive control (lambda DNA 10 ng); lane 5, control (DNase-free water). Amplification conditions: 6 h, 30℃. The amplified DNA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 150 V. (B) Restriction digestion of the amplified genomic DNAs by using HindIII enzyme. Lanes are same as in (A). Lane M2, 1 kb DNA ladder. The digested samples were analyzed by performing routine 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer at 150 V.
