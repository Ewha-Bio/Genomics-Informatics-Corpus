Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has resulted in an exponential growth in data in the past decade, primarily fueled by the general interest of the scientific community in functionally annotating the human genome. The power of high-throughput parallel sequencing was deployed to characterize human genetic variation, in an international effort launched in 2008, called the 1000 Genomes Project, with the hope that such a large-scale endeavor would help in identifying all the underlying genetic differences that lead to disease resistance/susceptibility [1].
In the meantime, based on numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it was realized that 93% of the trait-associated polymorphisms within the human population were located in non-coding regions, potentially within cis-regulatory elements [2]. In fact, in the mid-1970s, King and Wilson [3] pointed out the importance of mapping regulatory events and hinted that a small difference in the time/level of activation of a single gene could influence overall systemic development. They estimated the genetic distance between human and chimpanzee to be much smaller than the corresponding genetic distance between the sibling species of Drosophila, thereby underscoring the need to explore regulatory/expression differences at different times as a basis to explain the evolutionary differences at the organismal level [3].
