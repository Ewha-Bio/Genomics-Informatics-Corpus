Features of the TC calculation in our study
Unlike previous studies that calculate the protein activity, TC calculation is a high-throughput analysis. Vermeirssen et al.[20] used a quantitative in silico analysis to calculate the inhibitory activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). They used an in vivo analysis to calculate ACE activity, also. Our study to calculate TC is theoretically novel. Additionally, it is feasible not only to calculate TC, but also to calculate other annotated ones including transcription factor whose activity cannot be easily measured experimentally.
