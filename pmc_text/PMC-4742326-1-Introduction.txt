Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells contain important gene-regulating elements, located within promoter regions [12]. It is known that promoter sequences possess special signatures to distinguish them from the rest of the genome sequences. A few core promoter elements have been detected, of which the most common elements are the CpG island, TATA box, initiator (Inr), downstream promoter element (DPE), and TFIIB recognition element (BRE) [2], but these promoter elements may not be universal.
Recently, a group from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project published chromatic maps to mark histone modifications within nine cells of different types from the human genome, drawn from the results from chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of these same cells [12]. From each of these nine cells, Ernst et al. [34] published 15 chromatin states of the human genome. Among them, the first three states represent promoter regions: state 1 (Active_Promoter), state 2 (Weak_Promoter), and state 3 (Poised_Promoter). The information gained from the exploration of promoter elements and transcription starting sites will enable researchers to produce more accurate promoter prediction algorithms, which in turn will yield deeper insight into the process of transcription initiation and gene functions.
Here, we publish frequency profiles of the ChromHMM promoter states of the human genome, at 200bp intervals, paying particular attention to the existence of promoter elements, such as CpG islands, TATA boxes, Inr, DPE, and recognition elements from the transcription factors that bind with polymerase II (BRE) (signal features), together with transcription starting sites, in terms of size, overlapping patterns, and locations.
