Mutant genes dependent on metastasis
We found that there was no difference in the overall frequency of metastatic and non-metastatic samples (Fig. 2). The nine mutant genes found in non-metastatic samples were all included in the major mutant genes in the overall samples (Fig. 3B). The lineage-dependent frequency in non-metastatic samples was also similar with the overall pattern in Fig. 3A. However, half of the 15 major mutant genes from metastatic samples were different from the mutant genes in non-metastatic or overall samples (Fig. 3C). The mutations of FAM182B, LOC653544, PLEC, STAG2, PTPRT, CSMD3, and LRP1B represented unique frequencies in metastatic samples. Especially, PTPRT is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. The deletion of PTPRD, included in the same PTP family, is frequently seen in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [17]. Further studies are required for other major metastasis-associated mutant genes. In conclusion, the diversity of major mutant genes in metastatic samples is quite different from those in non-metastatic tumors, although the overall mutation frequency is similar between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. The present study provides a useful resource for understanding the varied frequency of diverse mutations in patients' tumor samples.
