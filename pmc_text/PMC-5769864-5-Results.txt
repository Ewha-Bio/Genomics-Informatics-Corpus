Regulation of RNA secondary structure
The secondary structure of mRNA is important for controlling translational speed and timing, on which synonymous codon mutations might have crucial effects. For instance, removing rare synonymous codons from an expression construct decreases the enzyme activity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [15], which is due to alteration of the mRNA secondary structure by the removal of rare codons. The secondary structure of mRNA is also known to be associated with ribosome pausing, which is important for the formation of correct protein folding for insertion into the lipid bilayer in yeast [39].
The same observation has also been made in Escherichia coli, such that the translational rate is influenced by the protein folding efficiency and that the folding efficiency is associated with an abundance of codons with a low concentration of cognate tRNAs. Consistently, Zhou et al. [40] found that optimal codons for high efficiency of expression are located in structurally sensitive sites in proteins. Zhang et al. [41] also demonstrated that synonymous codon mutations significantly perturb folding efficiency. Saunders and Deane [42] observed that synonymous codon usage is related to the secondary structure of local mRNA. All of these studies consistently suggest that synonymous codons might be involved in the formation of mRNA secondary structures that, ultimately, control translational speed and timing.
