Combined effect of bone mineral density (BMD)-decreasing alleles in Korea Association REsource (KARE) data. The genetic score of each individual was computed on the basis of the weighted model proposed in a previous study [18]. Effects are shown for BMD levels measured at the distal radius (BMD-RT) (A) and BMD levels measured at the midshaft tibia (BMD-TT) (B). Histograms represent the numbers of individuals with each genetic score area (left y-axis). Round spots (right y-axis) show mean BMD-RT standardized values in A and mean BMD-TT standardized values in panel (B). Vertical lines represent 95% confidence limits.
