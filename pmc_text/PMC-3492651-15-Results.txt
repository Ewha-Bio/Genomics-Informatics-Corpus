KDO enhances IFN-β signaling
KDO enhanced IFN-β-dependent signaling pathways in a time-dependent manner. Since TLR4 activation can also produce IFN-β, the KDO-mediated enhancement suggested cooperation between exogenously applied and endogenously produced IFN-β (Supplementary Table 4). Several IFN-β and KDO primary responsive genes were upregulated, including genes that activate the immune system. In some cases, the IFN-β gene signature dominated over the KDO gene signature. For example, IFN-β inhibited two KDO primary responsive genes, Il-1ra and Nfκbζ, but KDO did not change the expression of any of the interferon-responsive primary genes. The expression levels of select genes were validated by using QRT-PCR (Fig. 4).
Cytokine assays, conducted following a combination of LPS and IFN-β treatment, also demonstrated non-additive enhancement of Il-6, Il-10, RANTES, and TNF protein levels (Fig. 5A). This increase could be due to synergistic production of transcription factors in response to these ligands, apart from their classical transcription factors. It is likely that the rapid, greater-than-2-fold increase in Socs1 and Cish production may have contributed to the attenuated expression of the KDO secondary responsive genes [29, 30]. Il-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine regulated through the PI3K-AKT-GSK-CREB pathway [31, 32], and we noted its expression after 120 min of stimulation, suggesting that the PI3K pathway may have been activated after 60 min of stimulation.
KDO- and IFN-β-treated cells exhibited upregulation of many interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs), including Irf1, Irf4, and Irf8. Irf4 inhibits the expression of MyD88-dependent IRF genes by competing with IRF5 for binding to the same region of MyD88 [33]. Combined KDO and IFN treatment also upregulated genes with IRF3 binding sites in their promoters; i.e., Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, Isg15, and Gbp1. Our gene profiling results suggested that IRF3 is sufficient to induce antiviral responses at the initial activation time point, consistent with an earlier report that demonstrated a role for IRF3-dependent genes in establishing antiviral responses in Jurkat cells [34].
