Measurement of MRP2 promoter activity
VPA stimulated MRP2 promoter activity about 10-fold. The epileptic patients with ADRs of the CNS had less haplotype 1 (containing g.-1774del) than the epileptic patients with no ADRs. By inference, the g.-1774G allele, a major allele of the MRP2 promoter sequence, was associated with ADRs of the CNS in patients treated with VPA. Epileptic patients with g.-1774del instead of g.-1774G were more likely to be resistant to VPA-related ADRs, probably because the g.-1774del allele produced higher MRP2 promoter activity than g.-1774G, leading to more MRP2 proteins in the brain tissue after VPA treatment. The presence of more MRP2 affected the distribution of AEDs (especially VPA) from the blood to the brain, resulting in the appearance of VPA-related ADRs in patients with g.-1774G rather than g.-1774del. Our luciferase assay data supported this hypothesis. There was no difference in luciferase activity between g.-1774del and the others (g.-1774G, g.-24C>T, g.-1549G > A) with non-VPA treatment. Luciferase activity was different, however, following 3 mM VPA treatment; g.-1774del promoter (haplotype 1) activity was 134% higher than g.-1774G promoter (haplotype 2) activity (n = 5; p < 0.05 by t-test). Further, the g.-1774del MRP2 promoter increased 1,014% with 3 mM VPA treatment compared to non-VPA treatment. However, the g.-1774G MRP2 promoter also increased 816% with 3 mM VPA treatment compared to non-VPA treatment. The change of g.-1774G â†’ del increased the expression of MRP2 in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells treated with 3 mM VPA (Fig. 1).
