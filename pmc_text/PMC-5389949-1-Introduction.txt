High-throughput mRNA sequencing technology has developed at great pace in recent years [1]. Data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments across many species and tissue types are available for free access through public repositories. While RNA-Seq data have a wide range of applications, such as alternative splicing research, fusion gene finding, novel transcript discovery, etc., the most important and widely considered application is the quantification of gene expression profiles and the assessment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [2].
Evaluating differential expression in conditions by RNA-Seq is a multi-step process [3]. R/bioconductor [4] has been used to develop tools for the statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data. Some packages stem from classical methods for microarray data analysis, like the t test. Others, like edgeR [5], DESeq [6], DEGSeq [7], and baySeq [8], have recently been developed to the characteristics of RNA-Seq data. However, different packages partially support varying steps of the multi-step process in a very inconsistent manner. Moreover, no R packages support data filtering steps to improve the statistical power and control outliers that might have an undesirable influence on further analysis [9].
This study proposes TRAPR (Total RNA-Seq Analysis Package for R, http://www.snubi.org/software/trapr), an integrated pipeline for the analysis of RNA-Seq gene expression data. TRAPR uses gene expression tables to perform all RNA-Seq analyses, including data preprocessing, filtering, normalization, and statistical tests. TRAPR also provides visualization functions for data exploration and results' summarization. TRAPR provides a unique way of combining state-of-the-art analysis methods in an integrated pipeline for comprehensive RNA-Seq data analysis. For instance, upper-quartile normalization followed by zero-value filtering, variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) [10], and edgeR statistical testing with proper data visualization can easily be streamlined. These combinations have considerable potential to improve the accuracy and statistical power [11] of the analysis of RNA-Seq gene expression data.
