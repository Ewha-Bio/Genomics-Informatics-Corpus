Clinical characteristics of 62 children according to genotype of rs3782933
The p-values for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and minor allele frequency of KLF rs3782933 were 0.8286 and 0.3333, respectively. The SNP of KLF5 showed significant differences with several clinical factors, such as BMR, muscle, LDL-C, insulin, and C-peptide (Table 2). Children with the TT genotype had significantly higher BMR than those with the wild-type (CC genotype) (p = 0.030). The highly correlated factors with BMR, such as height and muscle composition, were also higher in children with the TT genotype than those with the CC genotype (p = 0.032). The diabetic factors, such as insulin and C-peptide, were also higher in the children with the TT genotype than those with the CC genotype (p =0.029 vs. p = 0.004, respectively) (Table 2). On the other hand, the alleles of the KLF5 gene showed a divergent trend when compared with the genotype. For example, the children with the T allele had significantly lower TC and LDL-C than those with the C allele, regardless of BMR (Table 3).
