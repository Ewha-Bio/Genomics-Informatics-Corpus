Insights of window-bsed mechanism approach to visualize composite bioData point in feature spaces
In this paper, we propose a window-based mechanism visualization approach as an alternative way to measure the seriousness of the difference among data-insights extracted from a composite biodata point. The approach is based on two components: undirected graph and Mosaab-metric space. The significant application of this approach is to visualize the segmented genome of a virus. We use Influenza and Ebola viruses as examples to demonstrate the robustness of this approach and to conduct comparisons. This approach can provide researchers with deep insights about information structures extracted from a segmented genome as a composite biodata point, and consequently, to capture the segmented genetic variations and diversity (variants) in composite data points.
