Increased migration and MMP2 and MMP9 activity in H460R cells
Since spindle-like morphology and an increase in cell scattering were found in H460R cells (Fig. 1A), a small number of cells were seeded and cultured for 8 days; colonies were stained with crystal violet. We observed scattered morphology of colonies in radioresistant H460R cells compared with parental cells. To test the possibility of increased metastasis in H460R cells, we measured migration and representative MMP activities, including MMP2 and MMP9, using a wound healing assay (Fig. 2B and 2C) and gelatin zymography (Fig. 2D), respectively. We confirmed significantly increased migration as well as MMP2 and MMP9 activities in H460R cells. Since E-cadherin and N-cadherin are known as important marker proteins for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, expression levels of these proteins were determined via Western blot analysis. E-Cadherin was not detected (data not shown), and no difference was observed in the expression of N-cadherin protein between H460 and H460R cells. However, Î²-catenin protein levels increased in radioresistant H460R cells (Fig. 2D).
