Porphyromonas has recently been considered a uterine pathogen in metagenomic studies [10, 23â€“25, 29]. Within the genus Porphyromonas, Porphyromonas levii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, and Porphyromonas somerae were the most abundant species in the uterus of dairy cows [39]. Among these species, only P. levii was determined to be a uterine pathogen by the quantitative PCR analysis [33]. P. levii were also known as a pathogen causing bovine foot rot [40] and necrotic vulvovaginitis [41, 42]. It has been demonstrated that P. levii has the ability to avoid phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils through production of immunoglobulin protease [43]. This may enable them to invade the endometrium during infection [44].
