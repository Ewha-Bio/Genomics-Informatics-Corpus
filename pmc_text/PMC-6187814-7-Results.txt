GO analysis
A GO analysis was performed in Landrace and Yorkshire pigs in Korea. Table 3 shows the GO terms with a p-value < 0.05. The major GO terms were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization and reorganization. Neuronal genes were reported to be related to subcutaneous fat thickness in human and pig [4]. However, the neuronal genes mentioned above did not match any genes in our neuron-related genes. The neuronal genes were ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. We considered the association between fat accumulation and these neuronal genes to be novel. The cell morphogenesis genes were NOX4, MKLN1, ZNF280D, BAIAP2, DNAAF1, LRTM2, PCDH15, NGFR, RBPJ, MYH9, APBB2, DTNBP1, TRIM62, and SLIT2. In addition, the actin cytoskeleton organization and reorganization genes were MKLN1, BAIAP2, PCDH15, BCAS3, MYH9, DTNBP1, ABL2, ADD2, and SLIT2. Among these genes, PCDH15 is related to individual noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) susceptibility. NIHL is a commonly recorded disorder, accounting for 7% to 21% of hearing loss [9]. NGFR is the nerve growth factor receptor [10] and dystrobrevin-binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) is an NMDA-receptor mediated signaling gene. NMDA is N-methyl-D-aspartate and DTNBP1 has the ability to modulate synaptic plasticity and glutamatergic transmission through NMDA receptors [11]. BAIAP2 is the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 associated protein gene [12].
