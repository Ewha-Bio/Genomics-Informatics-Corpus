The following features have been added to both the neural network and the dataset parser of NeuroNER:
‒ POS features: with our modification, PharmacoNER tagger can parse annotations (both in BRAT or CONLL formats) of POS tags, encode them with a one-hot encoding for each token and include this in the token embedding layer of the network.
‒ Gazetteer features: our modified version of NeuroNER is able to parse a text file with terms related to the target entities, build a dictionary and assign a positive value for the words that are found in this dictionary. This feature is then concatenated with the character-enhanced token embedding layer. A file with the dictionary has to be supplied by the user.
‒ Affixes features: PharmacoNER tagger can use information regarding affixes in a similar manner as the gazetteer features, but using regular expressions to detect whether a particular word has an affix related to the target entities. A file of affixes shall be supplied by the user.
Notice that the aforementioned features are domain and language independent. The final software can be found in Github (https://github.com/PlanTL-SANIDAD/PharmacoNER), with information about installation and samples. In Fig. 2, the adaptation of the neural network is also depicted, showing the differences from Fig. 1.
