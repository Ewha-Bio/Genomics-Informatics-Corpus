Phylogenetic heat-plot overview of multiple-genome alignments. A heat plot based on a 200/100 BLASTN fragmented alignment was performed with Gegenees software. Six distinct genomic groups (T1â€“T6) recognized in cytolethal distending toxin (CDT)+ strains were observed sporadically among the strains that were studied, revealing the heterogeneous genomic nature of CDT-producing Escherichia coli.
