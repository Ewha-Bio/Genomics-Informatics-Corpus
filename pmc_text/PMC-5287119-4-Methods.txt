Notations
We assume that there are L SNPs and n subjects. Genotypes at SNP l are denoted by Xl, where l = 1, â€¦, L, and Y indicates the disease status: 1 for case and 2 for control. We assume that SNPs are bi-allelic, and capital and lowercase letters always indicate the major and minor alleles, respectively. For instance, AA indicates a homozygous reference genotype, Aa indicates the heterozygous genotype, and aa indicates the homozygous variant genotype. For simplicity, we denote the homozygous reference genotype, heterozygous genotype, and homozygous variant genotype as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
