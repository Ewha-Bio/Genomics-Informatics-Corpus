Neuropeptides are important signaling molecules that are involved in many kinds of physiological processes, including addiction, depression, mood regulation, and circadian rhythms. Because of their biological significance, neuropeptides have become key targets in drug discovery. While immunological techniques, such as RIA and IHC, require a priori knowledge of neuropeptides and only detect peptide sequences with known structures, MS enables one to detect and identify the precise forms of neuropeptides without a priori knowledge of peptide identity, resulting in the identification of previously unknown neuropeptides. In addition, MS-based quantitative analyses of neuropeptides based on either stable isotope labeling or label-free methods provide information on the relative levels of neuropeptides in different physiological conditions, which can be helpful in understanding the function of the neuropeptides. Continuous efforts to implement current MS-based peptidomics techniques for neuropeptide identification and quantitation are expected to provide more profound insights into the neurochemical communication of neurons in various physiological processes.
