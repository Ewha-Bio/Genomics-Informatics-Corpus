Inverted repeats involved in CNV instability
Genomic repeats, especially inverted repeats (IRs), can cause DNA replication error and induce CNV formation. IRs, sharing high sequence similarity in adjacent loci, are found to align or crossover with each other and form specific DNA secondary structures, such as cruciform structures, during DNA replication [58]. Formation of such secondary structures can cause DNA replication fork stalling, and later, jumping into the wrong locus to continue replicating (Fig. 2). This mechanism of triggering replication errors subsequently results in genomic rearrangements and CNV mutations [24].
