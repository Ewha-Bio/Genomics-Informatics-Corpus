Since the expression of ORs in mammalian germ cells was reported [7], OR expression in various organs and tissues in animals has been observed. The brain and the heart are the fundamental organs that form the basis of animal life. For example, controlling the fluctuation of blood pressure and pulse of an animal is accomplished by endocrine action through autonomic reflex and peptide hormone secretion. Brain and heart are closely connected to each other by various mechanisms, including the nervous system.For the first time, prostate-specific G protein-coupled receptors (PSGRs), also known as RA1c, were reported to be expressed in the brain of rat [13] and mouse [14] and the heart of rat and mouse [15]. It was not expected to be expressed in human tissues other than prostate.
