The presence of cis-acting eQTLs for a gene implies that these alleles have different transcription levels or allelespecific expression. The typical microarray chips designed for expression measurement do not usually distinguish minute sequence differences of the SNP alleles residing within a transcript. One can infer the allele-specific expression using statistical tests that model the expression levels of a gene with the number of minor alleles at each locus. On the other hand, by hybridizing the transcripts onto SNP chips or directly sequencing the transcripts, one can validate the allele-specific expression. Ge et al. [20] used Illumina Human 1M Beadchips to measure allele-specific expression in 53 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from European descendants. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, RNA-seq has become popular and has been applied to detecting allele-specific expression. Pickrell et al. [21] sequenced RNA from 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated African individuals who participated in the International HapMap Project, discovering a number of eQTLs involved in allele-specific expression or allele-specific splicing.
