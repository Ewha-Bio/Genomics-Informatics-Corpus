Construction of regulatory network using Genomica
We tried to explain the expression variations of target genes with those of TFs identified by iRegulon. Firstly, we checked correlation between expression of YY1, which is a predicted TF by iRegulon and known for an insulin signaling gene, and mean of those of target genes. However, the correlation coefficient is rather low (Fig. 3). This prompted us to construct the TF network module to explain the expression variations of target genes using Genomica (Fig. 4). We found most TFs participated in regulatory network constructed by Genomica have been known to have relationships with insulin from previous studies [1516171819]. While iRegulon provides a list of potential regulatory TFs ignorant of their expression conditions, Genomica has the power to filter the list by constructing conditional hierarchical regulatory network where the expression variations of the target genes are explained by the expression conditions of the filtered TFs. We describe a more reliable regulatory network controlling insulin-responsive genes by integrating completely different methods for constructing regulatory network.
