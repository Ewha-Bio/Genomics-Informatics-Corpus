Patient's positions
The patient's positions are mapped into the 2D space according to his genetic property. This property reflects the genetic similarity of the patients. Two patients are close together if their genes are similar, and conversely, they are located far from each other if their genetic properties are different. For example, Fig. 2 clearly illustrates two distinctive groups of patients, marked by the dash-line ovals. The small group contains mostly deceased patients, while the other contains patients that responded well to the treatment and survived the disease. The fact that the deceased patients are located close to each other in the gene space may support the hypothesis that genetic properties are essential to determine whether a patient is likely to respond well in the context of the clinical treatment.
