Permutation test
Permutation test is a nonparametric statistical test used when an underlying distribution of genetic data is not need to be assumed. If the derivation of a theoretical distribution of a test statistic is challenging, permutation test can be employed to compute an empirical p-value of the test statistic. For genomic data with a group structure, we first compute an individual p-value of a phenotypic association test for each genetic site. We then combine K p-values such that –∑i=1Klogpi, where pi is the p-value of the the i-th genetic site, and K is the total number of genetic sites in the gene or genetic region. Next, we repeatedly permute case-control labels and compute –∑i=1Klogpi for each permutation set. After we obtain the empirical distribution of –∑i=1Klogpi, we can easily calculate the empirical p-value from the original case and control set. This permutation based test for genomic data with a group structure has been demonstrated to be very efficient and powerful when we need to aggregate the information of multiple genetic sites [15].
