Fulminant type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a distinct subtype of T1DM that is characterized by rapid onset of hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis with absolute deficiency in insulin secretion, and near normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level at initial presentation [1]. It was first described in 2000 by Imagawa et al. [2], and was defined as diabetes with remarkably rapid onset (within a few days) and absolute destruction of pancreatic β-cells. The prevalence of fulminant T1DM is not uncommon and it is estimated to account for 7.1% of all newly diagnosed T1DM cases in Korea [3].
The detailed pathogenesis of fulminant T1DM is not fully understood. Both genetic and environmental factors, and their interaction contribute to the development of fulminant T1DM. Regarding genetic factors, it has been reported that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype and the HLADR4─HLA-DQ4 haplotype play a crucial role in the predisposition to fulminant T1DM. Specifically, the HLA-DRB1*04:05─HLA-DQB1*04:01 haplotype was associated with fulminant T1DM by an odds ratio (OR) of 2.9 in Japanese cases (n = 207) and controls (n = 325) [4]. In addition, the HLA-DRB1*09:01─HLA-DQB1*03:03 haplotype was also associated with fulminant T1DM by an OR of 2.1 [4]. However, these findings have not been replicated in other populations. Recently, three amino acid positions (HLA-DRβ1 position 13, position 71, and HLA-DQβ1 position 57) in the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules were shown to be significantly associated with T1DM in Europeans [5]. They explained 90% of the phenotypic variance in the HLA-DRB1─HLA-DQA1─HLA-DQB1 locus.
In this study, we investigated the HLA-DRB1─HLADQB1 haplotype and amino acid residues at HLA-DRβ1 position 13 and position 71, and HLA-DQβ1 position 57 in 11 Korean fulminant T1DM cases and compared their frequencies with that of the Korean Reference Panel obtained from 413 participants in the general population [6].
