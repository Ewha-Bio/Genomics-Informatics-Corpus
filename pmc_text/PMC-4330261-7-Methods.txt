Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Double-stranded oligonucleotides composed of the following sequences were used for human GLUT2 promoter probes: 5'-AAG ACC TCA GTA AAG ATT AAC CAT CAT TA-3'; 1 µg of up and down sequences of single-stranded oligomer were hybridized within PE buffer (20 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 nM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) by incubating them at 72℃ for 10 min and then at room temperature for 15 min. The probe was labeled with [α-32P] dATP by Klenow DNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and the labeled probe (25,000 cpm) was incubated with nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells that were transfected with pcDNA, wild-type HNF1B, and H153N and P159L HNF1B in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL poly(dIdC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography.
