Unsupervised clustering
Hierarchical clustering for both gene expression and DNA methylation was carried out using the R package. Euclidean distance was used as a distance metric, and single-linkage clustering was adopted. For gene expression profiles, highly variable genes were selected using the mean absolute deviation, and clustering analyses were conducted using these 1,000 selected genes.
