Annotation of the outputs of genomewide association studies
A large number of polymorphisms associated with increased risks of certain diseases or particular quantitative traits have been discovered by genomewide association studies. The identified genetic markers or risk variants, mostly composed of single nucleotide polymorphisms, were enriched within the genomic regions that were previously thought to be 'junk DNA' [11, 16, 17, 24-28]. The results of the ENCODE project have demonstrated that variants that fall in regulatory regions could indirectly influence coding genes linked to diseases or clinical traits. With the DHS map in hand, a research group studied more than 5,500 genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The result of their research revealed that approximately 75% of GWAS diseases- and trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). are concentrated in or near DNase I hypersensitive sites [29]. Together, they give new insights to the researchers who are carrying out GWASs.
