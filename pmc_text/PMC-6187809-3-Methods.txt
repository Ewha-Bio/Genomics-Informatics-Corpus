Library preparation and Ion S5 sequencing
We used a custom NGS panel, OncoChase-AS01 (ConnectaGen, Seoul, Korea), targeting 95 cancer-related genes (Supplementary Fig. 1) [10]. Ten nanograms of DNA was amplified, digested, and barcoded using the Ion Ampliseq Library kit 2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Ion Xpress barcode adapter kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amplified libraries were quantified using a Qubit fluorometer, the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit, and the Ion Library TaqMan Quantitation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The libraries were then templated on an Ion Chef System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Ion 520 and Ion 530 Chef Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The prepared libraries were sequenced on an Ion S5 Sequencer using an Ion 530 chip and Ion S5 Sequencing Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
