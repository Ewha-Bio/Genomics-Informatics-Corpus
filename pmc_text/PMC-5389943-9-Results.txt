Quality check (step 5)
The next step after sequence alignment is the QC of the aligned reads. The QC is performed by the ‘qQCReport’ function of the qAlign package. It samples a random subset of sequences and alignments from each sample or an input file and generates a series of diagnostic plots for estimating data quality by various methods. The output consists of seven plots. The main plot is shown in Fig. 2, and the other six plots are shown in Supplementary Files (Fig. 2, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).
