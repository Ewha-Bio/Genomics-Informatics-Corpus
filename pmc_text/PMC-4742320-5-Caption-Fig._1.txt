Classification of trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (TASs) across genic regions. (A) A pie chart showing the proportion of each type of genetic variant obtained from GWASdb [68]; nearGene-3, SNPs within 500 bps from 3' downstream of a transcript; nearGene-5, SNPs within 2,000 bps from 5' upstream of a transcript. (B) The proportions of intronic TASs and all intronic SNPs after subtracting TASs were compared. The '-' in 'all SNPs â€“ TASs' means 'subtraction of'. The statistical significance was analyzed by chi-squared test.
