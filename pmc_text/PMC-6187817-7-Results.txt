In the slow metabolizer subjects, homozygous deletion of the glutathione-S-transferase M1 gene (GSTM1 null), which leads to loss of enzyme function, was identified from the DMET Plus microarray. The systemic exposure to drug X, which is represented by the Cmax and the AUClast, was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects in every dose group (Table 1, Fig. 2). The apparent drug clearance (CL/F) was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001) (Table 1). The GSTM1 deletion polymorphism was confirmed using real-time PCR, and subjects with two functional GSTM1 alleles showed similar drug exposure to subjects with one functional GSTM1 allele (Fig. 3).
