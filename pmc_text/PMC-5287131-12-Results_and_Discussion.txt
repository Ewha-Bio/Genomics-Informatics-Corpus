Identification of potent drug target and domain prediction
Further, template structure identification for lpxD and lpxC proteins were undergone through similarity search against PDB. The template protein structure (PDB ID: 3PMO) from P. aeruginosa was selected for the drug target lpxD of B. petrii with 91% query coverage and 49% of identity where as template structure (PDB ID: 4FW3) from P. aeruginosa for lpxC protein of B. petrii with 88% query coverage and 56% of identity (Table 3). Though, it has been already established that lpxC catalyzes initially during the biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide and may be a potent drug target to block the lipopolysaccharide pathway of pathogens [47], the current investigation suggested, the status of lpxC protein B. petrii as un reviewed (Table 3) and have shown less number of interaction with other drug targets in comparison to lpxD (Table 2). Again, as per literature report, lpxD has a key role in biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide, and its inhibitors are also potentially attractive as antibacterial agents, as there is no close similarity found with human proteins [48]. Also, lpxD has a vital role in bio film formation which is causing nosocomial infection [16] and the status obtained from UniProt web server as reviewed (Table 3). This seems lpxD could be a potential drug target against B. petrii infection. Therefore, lpxD was proposed as a potent drug target subjected for further in silico study. Through BLAST search and inspection in CDD database, the conserved amino acid resides within the left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) domain of lpxD were identified (Fig. 5A), containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X).
