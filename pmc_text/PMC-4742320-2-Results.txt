Direct roles of introns
Regulation of alternative splicing
Introns are crucial because the protein repertoire or variety is greatly enhanced by alternative splicing in which introns take partly important roles. Alternative splicing is a controlled molecular mechanism producing multiple variant proteins from a single gene in a eukaryotic cell. One of the remarkable examples of the increasing protein repertoire by alternative splicing is the Drosophila Dscam gene, of which over 38000 isoforms can potentially be produced by alternative splicing. Pan et al. [27] have provided experimental evidence suggesting that approximately 95% of multiexon genes in the human genome may undergo alternative splicing. Furthermore, very short introns are selected against because a minimal length of intron is required for the splicing reaction [28].
It has been noticed that the length of conservations in flanking introns of conserved alternative exons, i.e., exons that are alternative in several species, is greater than the length of conservations in flanking introns of conserved constitutive exons, i.e., exons that are constitutive in several species [26], suggesting that introns carry cis-acting elements that regulate alternative splicing. In fact, short cis-acting motifs that are necessary for binding splicing factors have been recognized and named intronic splicing silencers and intronic splicing enhancers.
Positive regulation of gene expression
The expression enhancing effect of introns was first recognized in the experiment using simian virus 40 constructs with or without introns, showing that their protein products were significantly diminished without their introns [15]. Subsequently, Buchman and Berg [48] showed that, in a certain condition, constructs with introns were expressed up to 400 times higher than constructs without introns, suggesting that introns can strongly enhance gene expression. In fact, some introns are designed to be included to construct expression vectors for guaranteeing a higher level of expression [49]. A large-scale analysis performed in yeast also confirmed that genes with introns tend to have a higher level of gene expression compared to genes without introns [50]. A similar observation was made in mammals, as well [51].
Classically, enhancers mediate either direction of expression, up- and down-regulation of genes, and involve both spatial and temporal control of gene expression in a specific cell independent of genomic location [52]. On the contrary, intron-mediated enhancers (IMEs) mainly identified in plant generally act in the expression enhancement of genes and are primarily located in the first ordinary intron position within a gene. In fact, in experiments performed in Arabidopsis, rice, and even mammals, the expression level of a gene with IMEs was increased up to 100-fold [29]. Genomic location and distance from transcription start site can influence the IME activity unlike the mode of expression regulation performed by the classical enhancers [53].
Transcription initiation and termination processes are cellular processes that involve introns, as well, which need some sequence elements in introns to be correctly completed. For instance, some studies showed that specific sequence elements in introns, such as enhancers and silencers, regulate transcription initiation through modulating the function of the promoters of genes [3054].
Regulation of nonsense-mediated decay
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) was originally known as a surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes that selectively removes mRNAs containing erroneously generated premature termination codons (PTCs). However, several recent studies have suggested that NMD may be another normal mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression regulation [343555]. Consistently, a recent study has shown that the levels of the expressions of genes important for plant development are regulated by NMD [36]. The question is how NMD recognizes the PTC-containing transcripts, i.e., what the molecular characteristics of the NMD target transcripts are. Generally, NMD recognizes the transcript on which an exon-exon junction complex (EJC) resides more than 50~55 base-pairs downstream of an authentic termination codon as the premature transcripts, i.e., its target mRNAs, implicating that introns somehow play a role in recognizing the premature mRNA targets. Kalyna et al. [36] have shown that introns located in 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) play important roles in controlling NMD-sensitivity of transcripts.
Introns may be associated with mRNA transport or chromatin assembly
It has been reported that spliced transcripts are exported faster from the nucleus to cytoplasm than their unspliced counterparts [5657] indicating the association between splicing machineries and nuclear export, although there are some contradictory studies [5859]. In fact, nuclear transport to the cytoplasm of transcripts containing introns in their 5' UTRs was known to be regulated by the transcription export complex and the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, whereas the transport of transcripts lacking introns in their 5' UTRs was regulated by signal sequences located in the open reading frames (ORFs) of those genes [60]. A recent experiment using fluorescence in situ hybridization has investigated how intron-bearing and intronless constructs are distributed differently across the nucleus and cytoplasm and showed that intron-bearing transcripts are preferentially located in the cytoplasm [31].
There are some studies suggesting that introns may have a role in chromatin assembly as well. Recent genome-wide mapping analyses of nucleosome positions have shown that nucleosomes are relatively depleted in intron regions compared to exonic regions [3233]. Schwartz et al. [32] have suggested that sequence elements of intron ends may be responsible for nucleosome depletion in introns by pushing the nucleosomes away toward exons.
