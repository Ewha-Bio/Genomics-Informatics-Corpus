Drug-related knowledge discovery is the process of discovering novel drug targets, drug-side effects, drug-drug interactions (DDIs), drug-disease or drug-indications interactions. The novel knowledge discovery has mainly led to better understanding of the molecular bases of drug efficacy, and with focus on the application scenario of new drug discovery, drug development or drug repurposing [1], i.e., search and replacement of compounds developed for specific diseases [2]. Drug discovery is usually initiated by an experimental method or computational method. Experimental methods, either in vivo or in vitro, are more acceptable by the clinical community. However, the disadvantages of these methods, such as cost and time-consumption, are also obvious. The computational way, also known as in silico method, is mainly to perform the knowledge discovery under data mining instead of experimental (“wet lab”) manipulations. Early in 2009, a review in Nature [3] claimed that in silico predictions for drug discovery has come of age, and so far, PubMed has collected over 41 thousand papers about in silico drug knowledge discovery.
