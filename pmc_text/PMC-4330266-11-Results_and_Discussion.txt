Docking analysis of rpoB and RIF
On the basis of the modeled structure of rpoB (Fig. 4A), three-dimensional structures of the two mutants were obtained. The protein (rpoBs)-ligand (RIF) analysis was performed using AutoDock4.2 software [25]. Out of the 10 poses obtained, the best ligand pose was selected based on the lowest binding energy confirmation. As the amino acid (serine at 450 and histidine at 445) position of rpoB was reported to undergo mutation in most of the RIF resistance strains, the docking of RIF was performed around these amino acid positions. Upon docking, RIF interacts with the wild-type rpoB protein (Fig. 4B) with a binding energy of -4.96 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 231.21 ÂµM, whereas in the case of the rpoB (S450L) and rpoB (H445Y) mutants, the binding energies were found to be 8.38 kcal/mol and 3.91 kcal/mol, respectively, with no inhibition constants predicted, which revealed RIF resistance in the mutant proteins.
