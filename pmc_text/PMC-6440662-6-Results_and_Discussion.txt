Sequence analysis
Sequences of all the 674 HPs were analyzed for identification of the functional domains using five bioinformatics tools namely CDD-BLAST, Pfam, HmmScan, SMART, and SCANPROSITE. If the given five tools indicated the same domains for a protein, we considered it as 100% confidence level. In our study, all the five tools mentioned above revealed 39 such proteins and hence were grouped together. Only these HPs having 100% confidence level were considered for further analyses and termed as highly confident (Hconf) proteins. From the rest of the 635 proteins, no specific conserved domains were found for a total of 257 proteins. For other HPs (n = 378), specific domains were identified using several of these tools. To know accurate function of these proteins further studies are required.
The function of each of these 39 Hconf were successfully assigned by using different online tools, listed in Table 1. All sequence analyses were compiled and categorized into various functional classes constituting 9 enzymes, 10 binding proteins, 4 transporters, 4 lipoproteins, 6 which are involved in various cellular processes, while 6 proteins were predicted to exhibit miscellaneous functions (Fig. 3). Various functional classes of these classified Hconf proteins are described below.
