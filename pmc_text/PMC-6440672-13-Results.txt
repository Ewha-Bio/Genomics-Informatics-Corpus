Prediction model results
Two measures of assessment were considered. One was Harrellâ€™s concordance index, and the other was the 2-year time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) [21, 22]. For purposes of comparison, we considered three models: a multiple Cox model with only clinical variables (M1), penalized Cox regression (M2), and our proposed method (M3). Table 4 shows the C-index and time-dependent AUC of each model. Among the three models, penalized Cox regression M2 showed even worse results than M1 alone with the clinical variables, whereas our method, M3, showed the best performance.
The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves for the training sets and test sets are shown in Fig. 2. In most of the range of Fig. 2, the curve of M3 is higher than the other curves on in the upper left corner, showing better performance with regard to prognostic prediction.
