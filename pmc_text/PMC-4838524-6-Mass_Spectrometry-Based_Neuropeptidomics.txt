Sample Preparation for Peptidomics Experiment
Although MS allows the identification of a large number of neuropeptides in a high-throughput manner, sample preparation prior to MS is a critical step that affects peptide identification coverage in peptidomics experiments. When the animal is sacrificed and the brain tissue of interest is obtained, proteases rapidly degrade larger proteins into smaller peptides that fall into the mass range of neuropeptides. The presence of degraded products derived from highly abundant proteins often complicates the MS analysis and interferes with the identification of less abundant neuropeptides. Different techniques, including focused microwave irradiation before decapitation, microwave irradiation after decapitation, and boiling the tissue immediately after decapitation, have been used in order to inactivate the proteases responsible for the high background of protein degradation fragments [323435363738]. In addition to the procedures of protease deactivation, peptide extraction and subsequent treatment are other steps that affect the number of identified neuropeptides. The use of different solvents and procedures can affect the peptide profiles detectable in brain tissue. Che et al. [31] compared different extraction conditions for the recovery of neuropeptides from mouse hypothalamus. They found that sonication and heating in water (70â„ƒ for 20 min), followed by cold acid and centrifugation, enabled the efficient extraction of many neuropeptides without the formation of the protein degradation fragments seen with hot acid extractions. Bora et al. [39] and Lee et al. [37] also showed that multiple stages of peptide extraction, including boiling water, acidified acetone, and acetic acid, were able to maximize the number of identified neuropeptides from their respective analyses of supraoptic nucleus and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) samples in the rat brain.
