Protein phosphorylation
Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed to resolve a mixture of proteins by size. The resolved proteins were transferred from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) via electroelution. The blot was processed for detection of specific phosphoproteins with a mixture of antibodies. All of the incubations and washes were conducted at room temperature with gentle shaking using an oscillating platform shaker. A Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 gel and a blot analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) were used.
