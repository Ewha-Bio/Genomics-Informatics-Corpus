NotI restriction enzyme digestion. A combination of NotI restriction enzyme digestion of fosmid DNA isolated from randomly chosen clones from the Prebiocide, Tank A, and control (DNase free water) libraries and ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel electrophoresis verifies the presence of a >40-kb insert. Lane M, DNA ladder; lanes 1-10 show NotI-digested fosmid DNA selected from the Prebiocide, Tank A, and control libraries. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis conditions: 4.5 V/cm, 1-7 s, 13 h, 1× TBE buffer at 14℃.
