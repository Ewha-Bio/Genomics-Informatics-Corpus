Genotype estimation
CNV genotypes consist of zero copies, one copy, and two copies. To do this, we used an R package, named ‘CNVtools,’ with default parameters to estimate CNV genotypes [23]. CNVtools is a mixture model for one-dimensional CNV data summary that can separate samples into each CNV genotype. To estimate genotype, we employed the linear discrimination function, which uses a raw signal and pca signal calculated from the average log2 ratio of all individuals using CNVtools. CNV genotypes consist of three genotype groups: “single-class,” “multiple-class,” and “ambiguous” (Supplementary Fig. 1) [2425]. We performed an association study with only well-clustered “multiple-class” CNV regions.
