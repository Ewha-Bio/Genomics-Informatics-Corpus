Bacteroides was the most abundant genus in the uterus of metritic cows and the only genus that was significantly more prevalent in metritic cows than in healthy cows [23]. Also, the relative abundance of Bacteroides was shown to be associated with uterine discharge [23], suggesting that Bacteroides is the main pathogen causing metritis. In the genus of Bacteroides, B. heparinolyticus was the most abundant species in the uterus of cows with metritis [23]. However, absolute quantification of this bacterium was not significantly different between healthy and metritic cows [33]. B. heparinolyticus was found in the blood and feces of dairy cows, but it was more likely to colonize the uterus [34]. Considering the large proportion of B. heparinolyticus in the uterus of healthy and metritic cows, the role of B. heparinolyticus in uterine health is warranted. B. pyogenes was the second most abundant Bacteroides species in the uterus of cows with metritis [23], and it was recently recognized as a uterine pathogen in dairy cows associated with a fever [10]. B. pyogenes was first identified in abscesses and feces of pigs [35], and it has been identified in infected wounds after cat bites in humans [36]. Relatedness of B. pyogenes strains isolated from other hosts needs to be investigated to explore the origin and pathogenicity of B. pyogenes in the uterus of dairy cows. Bacteroides species are capable of causing diseases through a polysaccharide capsule, release of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharides), evasion of the host immune response, production of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., hyaluronidase and chondroitin sulfatase), production of hemolysins, release of enterotoxin (fragolysin), and aerotolerance [37]. Particularly, Bacteroides species are known to be resistant to several antibiotics including ceftiofur, which is a widely used antibiotic for treating metritis in dairy cows in the United States and Europe [24, 38].
