A total of 41 clinically relevant CNVs were detected in 28 (66.7%) patients: three (10.7%) of those presenting with MCAs, 23 (82.1%) with a variable degree of DD or ID, and two (7.1%) with varying degrees of ID and ASDs; 10 (35.7%) patients had multiple rearrangements.
Among 28 pathogenic cases, nine were diagnosed with microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, including 1p36 deletion syndrome, 5q14.3 deletion syndrome, 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, 16p11.2 duplication syndrome, 19p duplication syndrome, 9p duplication syndrome, 19p13.2 deletion syndrome, and 22q11.2 duplication syndrome.
In this study, more pathogenic duplications were observed than deletions (22 vs. 19). Also, 12 cases (28.6%) were VUS, and two cases (4.8%) were benign CNVs (Table 1).
