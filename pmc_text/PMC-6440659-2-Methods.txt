We used two sets of species (148 in total); 96 species in set A were chosen from stAIcalc [17], and 55 species in set B were chosen from Ensembl [18]. Three species (S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster) were included in both sets. Protein-coding sequences (CDS) for set A and set B were retrieved from NCBI GenBank [19] and Ensembl, respectively. Weight values for each tRNA of set A and set B were obtained from stAIcalc and the genomic tRNA database (GtRNAdb) [20]. According to NCBI taxonomy [21], overall, 148 species were classified into five kingdoms.
The values of stAI for the two sets were calculated in different ways. For each species in set A, species-specific relative adaptiveness values (wi) of 61 codons were obtained by the value provided by stAIcalc; then, the stAI of a gene (g) was calculated by obtaining the geometric mean of relative adaptiveness values of codons in the gene as follows:
s t A I g = ( ‚àè k = 1 l g w i k g ) 1 / l g ,
where ikg is the codon defined by the kth triplet in gene g and lg is the length of the gene in codons (except the stop codons). For set B, the values were calculated by stand-alone software provided by stAIcalc with inputs of CDS and tRNA copy numbers obtained from GtRNAdb.
