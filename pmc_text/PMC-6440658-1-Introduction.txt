Viruses mutate faster than other microorganisms, and such mutations often lead to malignant infections in humans, animals, and plants. Therefore, it can be useful to develop methods to rapidly identify mutant viruses on the basis of International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) taxonomy [1]. The function of a protein depends on its tertiary structure and alterations in protein tertiary structure leads to changes in protein function. Protein tertiary structure is determined by protein primary structure, which is comprised of the combination of amino acids. Therefore, from the genetic point of view, alterations in protein tertiary structure imply changes of the protein sequence in the coding region in the exons of the genome sequence. Thus, genetic mutations can alter the function and structure of protein and lead to disease. Therefore, in order to quickly detect the similarity of function at the emergence of new viruses, the final purpose is to analyze conserved domains, which can identify specific protein sequences for each virus. As the first application of this approach, we focused on norovirus, a positive single-strained RNA virus in Caliciviridae [2]. We extracted coding region (CDS) sequences in viral RefSeq GenBank and then apply the CDS protein sequences to the conserved domain database (CDD) (Table 1) [3]. Thereby, we assigned the meaningful annotation and selected specific protein sequences from domain tables generated by executing RPS-BLAST with the query of complete genome for each virus in Caliciviridae.
