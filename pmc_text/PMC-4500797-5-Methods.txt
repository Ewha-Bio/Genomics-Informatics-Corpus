Processing of yeast data
Genotype and gene expression microarray data [10] used in previous expression QTL studies [129] for >100 segregants from a cross between two parental strains of yeast (BY4716 and RM11-1a) were obtained. As previously suggested [22], adjacent genetic markers with less than three genotypic mismatches across the yeast strains were merged into the average genotype profile, resulting in 1,533 unique markers. We employed the microarray dataset of normalized expression levels of 5,352 genes as previously used [10]. FAIRE experiments were performed based on the published protocol [23]. The FAIRE-seq data for the 96 yeast strains from our previous work [12] is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE33466. Briefly, we identified open chromatin regions in 96 yeast segregants by means of F-Seq [17]. The overlapping peaks across the 96 strains were merged into a single peak by using BEDTools [18], resulting in a total of 7,527 accessible chromatin regions. For each sample, the number of the FAIRE-seq reads mapped to each region was counted and the read count was normalized as previously suggested [1920] to obtain normalized chromatin accessibility, which was then further normalized to zero mean and unit variance across the 96 segregants.
