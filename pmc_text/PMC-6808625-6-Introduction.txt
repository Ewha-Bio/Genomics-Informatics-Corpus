Our proposal
Our proposal involves the adaption of a state-of-the-art NER (i.e., NeuroNER) based on deep learning to the particular domain of the Spanish medical texts in order to identify identities as proteins or other components. Remarkably, the system we base our work on has a CRF layer apart from deep learning components. The original system takes tokens as its input, while our proposal involves using additional features in the neural network.
