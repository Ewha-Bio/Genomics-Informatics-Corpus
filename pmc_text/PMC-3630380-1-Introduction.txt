Between 350 and 400 million people worldwide are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2]. In most HBV-infected patients, spontaneous recovery (SR) by the host immune system is common. However, 5% to 10% of patients fail to recover and remain as HBV-induced chronic liver disease (CLD) patients [3]. CLD, including HBV-induced chronic hepatitis B (HEP) and HBV-induced cirrhosis (CIR), is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, which can lead to liver-related death [4]. The high mortality of CLD is a major problem in HBV-endemic countries [5]. In Korea, which is an HBV endemic area, more than 70% of CLD patients are infected by HBV [6, 7].
CD8+ T cells are key factors involved in the chronicity of CLD. The major roles of CD8+ T cells in HBV clearance are the production of interferon (IFN)-γ, which inhibits HBV gene expression and the assembly of HBV RNA-containing capsids, and the induction of apoptosis of virus-infected hepatocytes, which requires physical contact with CD8+ T cells [8-11]. However, the CD8+ T cells of CLD patients undergo activation-induced apoptosis instead of proliferation in the presence of antigen-presenting cells [12, 13]. Apoptosis of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in CLD patients and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected type I IFN receptor-null mice is mediated by B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 [12, 14-16], indicating that type I IFN is critical to the survival of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells during the transition from acute to chronic HBV infection. Kolumam et al. [16] reported that type I IFN acts directly on CD8+ T cells to allow clonal expansion and memory formation in response to LCMV infection. Type I IFN receptor-null CD8+ T cells neither produce antiviral molecules, including IFN-γ, granzyme B, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α nor show reduced survival after antigen-induced stimulation [16].
Type I IFN on CD8+ T cells is critical for survival, proliferation, and antiviral functions [16]. IFNs are a well-known family of cytokines with antiviral effects [17, 18]. IFNs modulate cellular proliferation and stimulate immune responses through several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [19]. IFN-α-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) is a type I ISG [20-22] that maps to chromosome 1p35 [23] and is regulated by the Janus tyrosine kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway [24]. IFI6 is a mitochondria-targeted protein; it inhibits the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and delays the apoptotic process initiated and transduced by the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand/caspase 8 pathway [25]. The role of IFI6 is strongly associated with the immune system, but its antiviral effects are not well known [26].
In the present study, we hypothesized that IFI6 may be a survival-promoting factor for CD8+ T cells and therefore a determinant of the chronicity of HEP. The frequencies of IFI6 polymorphisms in CLD patients and SR controls were compared using logistic regression.
