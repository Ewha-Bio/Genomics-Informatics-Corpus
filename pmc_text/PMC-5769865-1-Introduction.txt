Amino acids play a central role in the building block of protein. The primary structure of the protein is determined by the arrangement of 20 naturally occurring amino acids. The function of a protein is determined from their amino acids and also they depend upon interaction with cofactors, binding with metal ions and interaction with other proteins. The proteome of all the organism share significant metal ions and metal binding cofactors to carry out its essential function. It has been estimated that approximately 30% of all proteins contain at least one metal. The proteins play a vital role in biological processes and in the stability of the protein by binding with metal ions or metal containing-cofactors [1]. The proteins bind with major metal ions like transition metals, alkali, and alkaline metals. The frequent metal ions that bind with proteins are sodium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, and zinc ions respectively. In in-vitro condition, the unfolded polypeptide may are observed to interact with metal ions that direct the polypeptide folding process [2]. Identification of metal binding through experimental procedures like the use of metal ion affinity column chromatography [3, 4], electrophoretic mobility shift assay [5, 6], absorbance spectroscopy [7], gel electrophoresis [8], nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [9â€“11], and mass spectrometry [3, 12] require tedious steps and specific instruments, making them expensive and may be unsuitable for unknown targets. In this aspect, there is a need for computational predictors of protein binding metal ion in order to reduce time and cost. For example, predictions of protein metal binding ions are useful in structural genomics, to select proper growth medium for overexpression studies and for the easy interpretation of electron density maps. But fortunately, metal-binding ability are encoded in the amino acidic sequences and these primary sequences help in protein structure formation. Through genomic projects various organism genomic sequences have been annotated somehow along with metalloproteins contained in them [1]. Bioinformatics has been extensively used to predict metal-binding ability from amino acid sequences. Various computational methods like artificial neural networks [13], support vector machines [14], decision tree algorithm [15], graph theory [16], FoldX force field [17], CHED [18, 19], and geometry algorithm methods [16]. These methods depend upon either only sequence information or the use of both sequence and structure information. However, most of the available prediction methods are either based on the knowledge of the apoprotein structure or restricted to few specific cases, like the metal binding of histidines/cysteines. Most of these methods have been implemented as standalone software or web servers to the research community [15, 20].
Due to the availability of cheap and advancement of sequencing instruments, the sequence of proteins has increased rapidly over when compared to protein structure data. This due to the fact that experimental determining the three-dimensional of protein is difficult and expensive. Through various theoretical and experimental studies, it is proved that minimal set of the amino acid is sufficient for protein folding [21]. The minimal set of representative residues with similar features can be achieved by grouping together the 20 amino acids by clustering. This method is called as reduced or simplified amino acid alphabet. Several simplified amino acid alphabets have been proposed, which have been applied to pattern recognition method in the prediction of protein structure [22], for generation of consensus sequences from multiple alignments, and for protein folding prediction [23]. Various computational predictor has used simplified amino acids to predict the solubility on overexpression, remote homology detection [19], and identify the defensin peptide family [24], effects of cofactors on conformation transition [25], DNA-binding proteins [26], heat shock protein families [27], inter-residue interaction [28], protein adaptation to mutation [29], and protein disorder [30]. In the present study, a random forest algorithm has been deployed to predict metal ion binding protein based on the simplified amino acids proposed by Murphy et al. [21].
