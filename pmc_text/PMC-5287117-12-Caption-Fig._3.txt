Internal validation shows the AUC values for each combination of variable selection and prediction methods. Each bar represents one of five SNP data sets. AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; ALL, SNPs only reported in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog; ASIAN, SNPs only reported in the GWAS catalog with an Asian population; KARE, Korean Association Resource; ALL + KARE, combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog and KARE cohort; ASIAN + KARE, combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog with an Asian population and the KARE cohort; SLR, stepwise logistic regression; LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; EN, Elastic-Net.
