(A–F) LD heatmaps and haplotype block partition results of an example region of chromosome 22: 37,908,435– 37,972,438 bp. Only non-singleton blocks found by each method are marked in orange colored rectangles. Two blue colored arrows in each of LD heatmaps are pointing the locations of 37,935,945 bp and 37,960,051 bp. LD, linkage disequilibrium; CI, confidence interval; FGT, four gamete test; SS, solid spine.
