We developed a rule-based protocol to detect msDNA in a given genomic DNA sequence. The rule is based on the presence of a 5â€“10-bp-long palindrome motif in the precursor transcript that is less than 2 kb upstream of a retron-type reverse transcriptase gene. The rule is augmented by enforcing a sequence similarity with known msDNA sequences. This step is implemented with an HMM profile search method. While this was a powerful filtration step, reducing the hits by about 1/20, it would inevitably miss some true msDNA sequences that are distantly related to the prototypes given in Table 1. As more distinct msDNA sequences are discovered, the panel of the seed sequences must be updated.
The list of potential candidate msDNA sequences was filtered by conformation to the known topology of the RNA secondary structure. The RNA secondary structure prediction programs usually output the result in terms of Vienna dot bracket notation [9]. As the manipulation of the string is not straightforward, some manual curation was involved. In the future, we will explore the possibility of automatic implementation, which is critical for web-based service of the prediction tool. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale annotation of msDNA in all publically available bacterial genome sequences. As our work is computational in nature, the list we compiled can include some false positives. Its authenticity should be validated experimentally. Nevertheless, our list of msDNA sequences and their species distribution profile constitute a useful resource for the future study of msDNA, as its biological role is still elusive.
