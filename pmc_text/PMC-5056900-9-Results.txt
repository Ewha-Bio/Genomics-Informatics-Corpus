Sequencing data and mapping statistics
Supplementary Table 4 summarizes the sequencing data and mapping statistics. The length of the target regions (base pairs, bp) corresponding to the 409 genes was 1,688,650 bp. The total number of mapped reads was 23,172,100, and the average depth of coverage was 1,432Ã—.
Variant types, regions, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant forms of each sample are shown in Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. A total of 7,314 variants were detected in the five samples, and the number of variants identified in each sample ranged from 881 to 4,099. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, most of the SNPs were transition-type (6,344 out of a total of 7,314 variants).
As a result of the filtering steps described above, 22 variants in 25 loci were detected (Table 1). All cases showed one (case No. 3) to 14 variants (case No. 2). The lysine [K]-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) gene showed the identical SNP variant (missense mutation) in four samples (cases Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5). Two different variants for the MYH9 gene were identified in one sample (case No. 2). Most of the variants were missense mutations, except for two stop gained variants for ATR and MBD1 and one frameshift variant for FLT4.
