Differential gene expression analysis
The filtered raw reads were mapped to the C. japonicum contigs that were determined by the de novo assembly and annotation using HISAT2. The expression values in RNA-Seq were calculated based on the read count, and the expression levels were analysed using the counts (number of fragments) and FPKM (Fragments per Kilobase of transcript per Million fragments mapped reads). The differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis among the leaf, flower and root tissues was carried out using the edgeR package [18]. The significantly DEGs were screened at a threshold false discovery rate < 0.05 and an absolute log2-fold change value > 1. Subsequently, GO functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the DEGs were performed.
