A schematic depicting the context of several epigenetic marks on chromatin; ranging from DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning patterns affecting the size and distribution of DNase I hypersensitive sites, transcriptional activity at non-coding sites leading to the production of small and long RNA, chemical modifications of histone moieties (e.g., mono-, di- and tri-methylation of the 4th lysine of the H3 subunit), and chromatin folding to form localized structures in 3D nuclear space (anticlockwise).
