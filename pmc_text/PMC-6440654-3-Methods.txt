RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the peripheral blood of the patients by Ficoll according to the protocol. Total RNA was isolated from PBMC samples using RNX-plus reagent (Cinnagen, Tehran, Iran) following the manufacturer’s RNA isolation protocol. The total RNA yield was determined by gel electrophoresis and spectro-photometry. RNAs were treated with DNase (SinaClone, Tehran, Iran) in order to eliminate any DNA contamination. For real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by using the reverse transcriptase enzyme. cDNA was synthesized by oligo dT and random hexamer primer in 10 μL reaction from 5 μg RNA based on manufacturer’s instructions.
