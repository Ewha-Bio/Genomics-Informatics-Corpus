Effect of the interaction of rs271, which was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs263 (r2 = 0.99), with daily fat intake on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) levels (p = 9.6 × 10-4). Subjects were divided into daily fat intake ≤ 20 g (TT or TC, 774; CC, 1,314), 21-30 g (TT or TC, 695; CC, 1,183), 31-40 g (TT or TC, 547; CC, 934), and ≥ 41 g (TT or TC, 702; CC, 1,144). Interaction p-value was calculated by linear regression analysis, which includes main and interaction effects, adjusted for residence area, age, gender, and body mass index.
