Hotelling's T2 test
Hotelling's T2 test is one of the representative multivariate tests used when significant differences between the mean vectors of two multivariate data sets are tested. It is known as a powerful multivariate test as long as data satisfies necessary assumptions such as random samples, multivariate normality and equivalent variance and covariance matrices between two groups. In genetic association studies with microarray data, the Hotelling's T2 test is often applied to find differentially expressed genes [1314]. We also applied the Hotelling's T2 test for each gene or genetic region to test a significant difference between cases and controls. We employed an R package ‘Hotelling’ for simulation studies and real data analysis.
