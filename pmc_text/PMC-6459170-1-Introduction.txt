Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and it is estimated that over 508,000 women have died due to breast cancer [1]. Five main intrinsic or molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been proposed: luminal A, luminal B, triple-negative (TNBC)/basal-like, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched (HER2+), and normal-like [2, 3]. These breast cancer molecular subtypes have different gene expression patterns, clinical features, treatments, and prognoses.
Chung et al. [4] proposed a single-cell-level breast cancer transcriptome and identified a clinically important subpopulation. To understand intratumor heterogeneity expression patterns in breast cancer, a breast cancer cell population from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) data was analyzed from a public database.
The HER2+-like TNBC subtype from GSE75688 was identified. ERBB2 expression in a BC07 triple-negative patient was not significantly different in bulk-RNA and scRNA data. PIK3CB and RAF1 were highly expressed in the cell population in the BC07 patient. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.
