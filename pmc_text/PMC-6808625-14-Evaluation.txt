Gazetteer
The gazetteer dictionary was built with a pharmaceutical “nomenclator” maintained by the Spanish government (https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/nomenclator.do), which consists of drug names and active components of medicines. For instance, indomethacin is listed as an active ingredient, and therefore the appearances of this particular word are marked as belonging to the dictionary.
