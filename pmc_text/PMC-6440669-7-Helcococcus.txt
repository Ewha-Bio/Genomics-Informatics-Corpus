Gram-positive facultative anaerobic Helcococcus ovis and Helcococcus kunzii were isolated from the uterus of dairy cows with metritis [48, 49]; but their involvement in metritis was not evident. Later metagenomic studies found that Helcococcus was associated with metritis [23] and endometritis [20], suggesting it to be a potential uterine pathogen. This is supported in a study by Cunha et al. [33] in which H. ovis was significantly prevalent in metritic cows than in healthy cows. Because of its presence together with E. coli and T. pyogenes [48], interaction with other uterine pathogens is likely during metritis development. H. ovis was also detected in sheep with subclinical mastitis [50], horses with pulmonary abscess [51] and cattle with valvular endocarditis [52, 53]. However, virulence factors of H. ovis remain to be elucidated.
