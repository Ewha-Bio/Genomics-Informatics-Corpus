Cysticercosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with the larval stage of the cyclophyllidean tapeworm Taenia solium. The T. solium metacestode (TsM) preferentially lodges in subcutaneous tissues and muscles, but often invades the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC, which is a leading cause of adult-onset seizure disorder, is a major global public health concern in several endemic areas [1]. Annually, NC causes approximately 28,000 deaths and more than three million people are at risk [2]. In endemic areas of Latin America and Africa, NC accounts for 10%–12% of all hospital admissions to neurological departments [3]. NC is becoming an emerging or a re-emerging disease in industrialized countries, due to the high frequency of immigration from endemic areas. Moreover, NC is now regarded as one of the most important food-borne zoonotic helminthiases [4].
Historically, taeniasis and cysticercosis have posed formidable public health problems in Korea. In the 1970s, the prevalence of taeniasis was 0.3%–12.7% according to stool examinations and 4.5%–38.0% by questionnaire surveys [5]. However, the prevalence is currently below 0.02%, and most affected patients are elderly and originate from remote islands [6]. From 1987 to 1990, a survey investigated the seroprevalence of NC in mixed epilepsy patients in Korea. A total of 2667 serum samples, randomly selected from 27 different localities, were tested for their specific antibody levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The positivity rate was 4.0% in the patient group (standardized positivity rate, 3.1%) and 2.1% in persons without mixed epilepsy (standardized rate: 1.8%). Geographically, the rate was the highest in patients living in Jeju Province (8.4%). Patients aged 50–59 years showed the highest positivity rates [7]. Another study of surgical specimens revealed that 149 of 80,947 cases (0.18%) were of parasitic origin. Of these, 112 cases were cysticercosis involving several organs, most commonly subcutaneous tissues and muscles [8]. From 1993 to 2006, a total of 74,448 serum samples obtained from patients with neurological manifestations and liver diseases were tested by ELISA. The percentage of samples showing high antibody titers against TsM cyst fluid (CF) antigen decreased from 8.3% to 2.2% [9], which indicated that cysticercosis, including NC, has continued to occur in Korea, although its incidence has substantially decreased.
The symptoms of NC vary depending on the number, location, and size of the infected worm(s); the duration of infection; the evolutionary stage of lesions; and the presence or absence of acephalic budding cysticercus [10,11]. Major symptoms include headache, seizure, paresis, and focal neurologic deficits. More importantly, NC is a leading cause of adult-onset seizure in areas where the disease is endemic [1,12].
The accurate diagnosis of NC is important for effectively controlling the disease. The key to the diagnosis of NC is interpreting the patient’s manifestations together with data provided by radiological findings and immunological tests, since the parasite’s eggs are not present in the patients’ stool. Neuroimaging diagnosis depends largely on computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because a definitive histological diagnosis is neither possible nor feasible in many cases [13,14]. However, these methods have limitations due to the highly pleomorphic presentation of NC, overlapping with that of other intracranial space-occupying lesions [14,15]. Tests to detect specific antibodies in the patient’s serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been applied to provide additional evidence. Immunodiagnosis might support other diagnostic procedures for NC in neurological patients [16,17].
Many cases of active-stage NC can be treated with specific chemotherapeutics. However, chronic NC and acephalic cysticercosis in the ventricles are not susceptible to anthelminthics, but should instead receive surgical or symptomatic treatment, such as worm removal surgery, anticonvulsants, analgesics, or shunt operations to relieve the increased intracranial pressure or to control intractable seizures [18]. Specific treatment can shorten and diminish the symptoms caused by inflammation associated with active NC, and such treatment appears to reduce the risk of headache and late-recurring refractory seizure [1,18].
In Korea, the mid-1980s brought dramatic advances in the management of NC. Emerging neuroimaging techniques greatly improved the capability to diagnose organic brain diseases [13,19]. The concomitant application of serological diagnoses [20,21] provided further evidence for the presence of the worm in the brain. Safe and effective chemotherapeutics for the medical treatment of NC were successfully launched [22,23]. Several molecular and cell biological studies have elucidated bioactive molecules of TsM that are crucially involved in the regulation of homeostatic functions [24,25] and the symbiotic protein interactome network of the worm [26]. These efforts have made the disease controllable and manageable. However, unsolved problems remain for the more effective management of the disease, such as control of intractable seizures, especially after medical treatment; the diagnosis of acephalic cysticercosis in the ventricles; and the serological diagnosis of early infections and patients who are infected with relatively few worms in the CNS and other areas. In this article, we briefly overview the advances and current status of the immunodiagnosis of NC in Korea.
