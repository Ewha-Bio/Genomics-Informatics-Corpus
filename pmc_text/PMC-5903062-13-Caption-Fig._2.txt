Density plot of substitution rates. It indicates that diving region exists in both Hanwoo (A) and Holstein (B). The protected region (low substitution rates) and the unprotected region (high substitution rates) can be differentiated by the diving region. The dividing region’s substitution rate (blue vertical line) was 7 × 10-11 and 6.5 × 10-11 in Hanwoo and Holstein, respectively.
