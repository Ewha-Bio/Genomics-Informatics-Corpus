The main element of a microbiome study is the microbiome abundance table, a matrix of counts, X, with n rows (samples) and k columns (taxa) where each entry xij provides the number of sequences (reads) corresponding to taxon j in sample i. Sometimes abundance tables are transposed, rows are taxa and columns are samples. Apart from the abundance table, other elements that may be available for microbiome analysis are the sample data, the taxonomy table, and the phylogenetic tree. Several R and Bioconductor packages, such as phyloseq, are designed to facilitate the integration of all these elements in a microbiome analysis [13].
