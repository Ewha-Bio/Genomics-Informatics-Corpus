The measurement of pulse rate
Pulse rate is the frequency of the heart beat (BPM). Pulse rate of KARE was measured 3 times while the participant was lying down, and the average value was used for the analysis (before the first measurement, participants rested for 5 min, and 3 measurements were taken at least 30 s apart). In HEXA-shared cohorts, the first measurement of the participants, who rested for 5 min, was used.
