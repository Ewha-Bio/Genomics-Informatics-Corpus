Selection of HOXA9 gene as a target in AML
The leukemia gene database (http://www.bioinformatics.org/legend/leuk_db.htm) documented the AF10, NUP98, CBFB, NUP214, HOXA9, CREBBP, ARHGEF12, CDX2, LCP1, CEBPA, DEK, FUS, and RUNX1 genes to be involved in AML. Among them, the HOXA9 gene is reported to have major relevance to their regulatory functions and aberrant expression in both mice and humans [1415]. Furthermore, identification of miRNAs that target the HOXA9 gene would help us to understand its interaction at the molecular level in AML conditions.
