Real-time quantitative PCR analysis
The enriched samples were analyzed with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and DNA quantification to evaluate enrichment bias and specificity. PCR primers were placed randomly in the targeted regions and quality controlled using standard genomic DNA. The qPCR results were used to estimate how much target DNA was present in the amplification products, and then, the specificity (proportion target material) was estimated by measuring the amount of DNA in the reactions.
The enriched and pre-enriched control DNAs were diluted (final dilution 1:3,600) in a PCR mix containing 1× PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 unit Platinum Taq, 0.2 mM dNTP (10297-018; Invitrogen), 1× SYBR Green I, 10% DMSO, and 0.16 µM of either on-target primer or off-target primer to a total volume of 30 µL. The genomic reference DNA was 10 ng of template in the same PCR mixture as described above. The qPCR was performed using an LC480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche), and the conditions were as follows: 95℃ for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of (95℃ 15 s, 56℃ 30 s), with end-point measurement of the fluorescence after each completed cycle.
