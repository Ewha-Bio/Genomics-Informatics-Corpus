Definition of T2D
An individual was coded as a T2D patient if the condition satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) diabetes diagnostic criteria: fasting plasma glucose (glu0) ≥ 126 mg/dL, plasma glucose (glu120) ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after an oral dose, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%. A total of 1,169 subjects were diagnosed as cases, and the other individuals were considered controls.
