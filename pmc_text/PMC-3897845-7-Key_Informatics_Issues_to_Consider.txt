Standardization
The lack of standardized vocabularies for clinical informatics has hampered the development of automated clinical decision support systems. Finding the laboratory term representing the same meaning of serum sodium for different database systems is troublesome in multi-center data integration. The National Library of Medicine has developed the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to enable these different vocabularies to be interoperable by developing a vocabulary at least at a basic level [24]. The same problems are known in bioinformatics. DNA sequences have different names and are joined in some databases only with varying levels of confidence. Codification of molecular diagnostic or cytogenetic results using existing medical vocabularies will have difficulties due to a lack of sufficient terms for molecular findings. For example, the Systematic Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) has minimal codes related to the description of molecular diagnostic findings. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) vocabulary has recently added a significant number of molecular pathology terms; however, it lacks the rich context-defining relationships provided by ontology [24]. The Clinical Bioinformatics Ontology (CBO) addresses this gap by providing uniquely identified concepts related to clinically significant molecular findings. The CBO consists of nearly 7,000 concepts, each of which is associated with a global unique identifier, and is associated with more than 15,500 relationships [25-27]. As the efforts to integrate two different domains are increased, vocabulary issues will be essential.
