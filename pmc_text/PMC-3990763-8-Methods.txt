Probe set analysis
The system also provides a capability to show and compare the property of a particular probe set across the patient's population. This property allows the analysts to have a comparative view of how a probe set in a gene behaves across the population. Fig. 5 shows an example of the visualization of the population that is colored by the value of the probe set "212022_s_at" at the gene "MKI67." The figure clearly indicates the significant difference of patients in the bottom-left cluster, which are mostly painted with "greenish" colors, corresponding to the high values, in comparison to reddish colors, corresponding to low values. It raises a new hypothesis that the probe set "212022_s_at" (or the gene) might play an important role in specifying the similarity space.
