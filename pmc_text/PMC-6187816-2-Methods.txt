When making 15-state ChromHMM BED files, the ENCODE consortium uses a core set of 9 chromatin markers [1]. We investigated whether some subsets of the annotated ENCODE 15-state model can be predicted by simply creating n-gram models of DNA sequences, in reverse [9]. To achieve this, ChromHMM blocks of human genome were initially dissected into a nucleosome resolution of 200-bp units and, by analyzing the 9 BED files of ChromHMM, each individual unit was assigned one dominant chromatin state. The process is explained in detail in the following sections: combining 9 BED files into a single file, filtering out highly variable 200-bp units, and finally building 5th order Markov Models.
