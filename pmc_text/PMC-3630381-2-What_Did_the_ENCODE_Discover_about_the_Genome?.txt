Accessible (open) chromatin
Until recently, it was generally believed that 80% of human genome was noncoding or junk DNA [10] and regulatory regions located in close proximity of genes to be expressed. The ENCODE project estimated that 2.94% of the whole human genome was protein coding, while 80.4% of sequences governed how those genes are regulated [11]. Open chromatin regions (nucleosome-depleted regions that are sensitive to cleavage by the DNase I enzyme) have been widely used to identify active DNA regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions [12, 13]. Open chromatin has been mapped by two approaches. A total of 2.89 million DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) mapped by DNase I digestion, followed by next-generation sequencing in 125 cell types and 4.8 million sites across 25 cell types that exhibited reduced nucleosomal crosslinking, were mapped based on formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements assay [11]. On average, approximately 200,000 DHSs were found to be active in any one cell [14]. Open chromatin regions have different proportions, based on their genomic location, and they cover approximately 2% of the genome [15]. Open chromatin regions are enriched for regulatory information and located at or near transcription start sites [6].
