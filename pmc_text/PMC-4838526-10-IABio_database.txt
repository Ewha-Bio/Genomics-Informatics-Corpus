Security evaluation
OAuth 2.0 has a weakness for vulnerable replay attacks. In this study, a replay attack can solve problems by using the 2-step access authorization. Replay attack and defense scenarios are shown in Fig. 6.
An attacker is disguised as a client to obtain an EC1 key (with access token) when passed during the communication between the authorization server and client. The attacker, disguised as a client, attempts to perform a replay attack obtained using the access token. In this case, the attacker has access to the web portal using the EC1 key (with access token) shared with the authentication server. However, the EC2 key is needed to access IABio database. An attacker who does not have the EC2 key can not access the data, because the attacker can not analyze contents in the access token of EC2. Thus, an attacker can not access the IABio database, because the attacker does not have the EC2 key. EC1 and EC2 can be obtained only from the pre-consultation process.
