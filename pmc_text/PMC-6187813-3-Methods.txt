Whole-genome sequencing library construction and sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and the sequencing library was constructed using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Library Prep Kit (San Diego, CA, USA). Next, paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq X Ten sequencing instrument, yielding ~ 150-bp short sequencing reads.
