Elevated serum uric acid levels are associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including gout, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases [1]. Several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genes that may be causally associated with uric acid levels, including the ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, member 2 (ABCG2) gene (MIM 603756) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Replication studies of ABCG2 variants have been performed in Western and Asian countries [8, 9]. Okada et al. [4] identified a significant association between the rs2725220 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 4q22 and uric acid levels.
The ABCG2 protein is a high-capacity transporter for uric acid excretion in the kidney, liver, and gut [10, 11]. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between uric acid levels and the ABCG2 SNP rs2725220 using a group of volunteers from the Korean Metabolic Syndrome Research Initiative Study in Seoul. We also analyzed the association of the ABCG2 SNP with body mass index and waist circumference levels.
