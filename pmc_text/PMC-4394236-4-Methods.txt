Model validation
The validations of structural geometric properties, like backbone conformation, and of the compatibility of residue interactions were performed using the Structural Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES; http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES). The Ramachandran plot statistics determined by the PROCHECK program (analyzing the phi [Φ] and psi [ψ] torsion angles) were used to verify the backbone conformation and overall stereochemical quality of the protein structures. The non-bonded atomic interactions of refined structures were analyzed using the ERRAT program [19]. Based on the inferences from the Ramachandran plot and ERRAT predictions, further refinement of side chain and backbone atoms was performed using MODREFINER [20] and was subsequently loop-refined using MODELLER 9v7 scripts. Additionally, these models were again refined using the WHATIF program [21] to remove atomic clashes (bumps) by rotating the side chain torsion angles (chi1, chi 2, and chi 3). Finally, the quality and plausibility of the predicted 3D structures were validated using ProQ, a model quality assessment program developed by Wallner and Elofsson [22].
