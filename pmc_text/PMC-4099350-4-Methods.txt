Protein structure prediction and validation of drug target
For modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the E6 protein, Phyre 2 server [20] was used. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted model were carried out using the YASARA Energy Minimization Server [21]. The refined model reliability was assessed through Procheck [22], ProSA-web [23], ProQ [24], and Verify-3D [25]. The refined model was further verified by the ERRAT server [26].
