Docking analysis of HPV-16 E6 with natural ligands
As all natural ligands (inhibitors) were found to be docked in various conformations and with varying binding energies, the lowest energy conformation was selected. Upon docking, the high-ranked binding energies of modeled structures of E6 oncoprotein with natural ligands were obtained (Table 1). HPV E6 degrades the p53 tumor suppressor protein. To accomplish the process of degradation, E6 proteins bind and modify the target specificity of the ubiquitin ligase E6AP. Based on the resolved structure of HPV-16 E6 by Zanier et al. [29], Cherry et al. [30] revealed in their docking analysis study that few flavonoid compounds bind in the hydrophobic pocket of the E6 and E6AP interface and mimic the leucines in the conserved α-helical motif of E6AP. Another study also showed that the biological activities of E6 are mediated by the interaction of E6 with the LXXLL motif of E6AP [31]. In our study, the E6 protein of HPV-16 showed one LXXLL motif (103LCDLL107). Out of six natural compounds included in our study, three (carrageenan, EGCG, and I3C) were found to interact with the LXXLL motif of HPV-16 E6 by forming a hydrogen bond with Leu106. According to Crook et al. [32], the p53-binding site is around amino acid residues 113-122 (CQKPLCPEEK) of HPV-16 E6 protein. The active site of the model was then analyzed based on the docking interaction of E6 with the p53-binding site with all 6 natural ligands.
Fig. 3 shows a docked pose of six ligand molecules with E6 protein, which showed almost similar docking results. The detailed interactions are given in Table 1. Each ligand interacts with the receptor at the p53-binding site. Among the 6 different ligands, carrageenan showed the lowest binding energy (-13.95 kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (0.059 µM) for the protein-ligand complex. Carrageenan was found to interact with the E6 residues Ala53, Phe54, Leu106, Ile108, Leu117, and Lys122 by forming hydrogen bonds. As mentioned in the introduction, carrageenan blocks HPV infection [10]; from our docking study, it might be revealed that the block of HPV infection might be due the high binding affinity of carrageenan towards the p53-binding site of E6 protein.
WA showed the second lowest binding energy of -7.58 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 2.77 µM. During docking with the receptor hydrogen bond, interactions were found with three residues (Ala53, Leu117, and Lys122) of E6.The other three compounds-EGCG, I3C and jaceosidin-were also found to interact with E6 protein with binding energies of -4.13, -4.06, and -4.01 kcal/mol, respectively. Leu106, Ile108, and Leu117 were the interacting residues of the receptor proteins with EGCG, whereas I3C interacted with Leu106, Pro116, and Lys122; Jaceosidin interacted with Phe54, Pro116, Leu117, and Lys122.
Curcumin was found to interact with E6 protein with less affinity (binding energy of -3.09 kcal/mol). All natural ligands were reported to inhibit HPV infection; our docking study also revealed the in silico validation of the inhibition. HPV-16 is known for causing high-risk cervical cancer. All ligands were found to interact with E6 oncoprotein of HPV-16 with significant binding energy and with amino acid residues known for p53 binding. This interaction might prevent E6 protein from interacting with host p53 protein, which may correlate with why these natural compounds are used to treat HPV infections.
