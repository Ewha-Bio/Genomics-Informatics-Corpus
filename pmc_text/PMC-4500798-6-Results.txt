Duplex interaction between miRNAs and mRNA of the HOXA9 gene
The leukemia gene database search result, supported by literature evidence [1415], signifies that HOXA9 (NCBI accession No. NM_152739.3) has aberrant expression at the molecular level and was therefore selected as a target gene in AML. Four miRNAs-namely, mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b (Supplementary Table 2)-were taken from the literature, and their target sites in the HOXA9 gene were verified through the miRTarBase web server. The predicted binding regions in the HOXA9 gene (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3) for the miRNAs above were supported by good MFE scores calculated for the miRNAs and mRNA duplex (Supplementary Table 4) using the mfold web server, which implicates a strong affinity between them at the molecular level. Three-dimensional binding modes of all miRNAs and mRNA duplexes (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) were constructed and deciphered (Fig. 1A-1E) using the Discovery Studio 3.5 suite.
