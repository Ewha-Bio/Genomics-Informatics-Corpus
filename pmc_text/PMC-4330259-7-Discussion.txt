In a cohort study of 991 subjects, an ABCG2 gene SNP was associated with increased uric acid, consistent with previous studies. Several GWASs have reported that ABCG2 exerts a major influence on uric acid levels [2, 3, 6, 7]. Dehghan et al. [6] conducted a genomewide study in which an SNP in the ABCG2 gene, rs2231142, displayed strong evidence of an association with uric acid levels (p < 10-60). Another GWAS also reported that rs2231142 showed a strong association with uric acid levels (p = 5.1 × 10-6) [2]. More recently, a GWAS in European-American obesity cases and controls reported significant genome-wide association of two SNPs with uric acid levels: rs2622605 and rs1481017 [3]. Another recent GWAS also reported a strong association between rs2231142 and uric acid levels (p = 3.34.1 × 10-42) [7].
In the present study, rs2725220 was found to have a strong association with uric acid levels. In agreement with these findings, a recent study reported that rs2725220 was strongly associated with uric acid levels (effect per allele -0.135 mg/dL, p = 4.2 × 10-30) [4]. Several recent studies reported that the association between serum uric acid and the allelic effects of SNPs in ABCG2 was sex-specific [8, 9]. In a recent study of 4 US populations, the association between rs2231142 and serum uric acid was significantly stronger in men and postmenopausal women compared to their premenopausal counterparts [9]. In the present study, the association of the ABCG2 gene SNP with uric acid was stronger in men than in women.
Associations between genotypes and phenotypes can be modified by gene-environment interactions. A modification of the effect of the associations between ABCG2 SNPs and serum uric acid concentrations by interactions with obesity has been reported [3, 9]. In a recent study of 4 US populations, the association between rs2231142 and serum uric acid was stronger in normal-weight subjects than in obese subjects [9]. In the present study, we also examined the association of the ABCG2 SNP with uric acid levels according to BMI level and waist circumference. The association was stronger in subjects with a high BMI and high WC levels than in subjects with a low BMI and low WC levels.
The ABCG2 gene encodes a membrane transporter belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of membrane transporters, a group involved in the trafficking of biological molecules across cell membranes. The ABCG2 gene contains 16 exons and spans over 66 kb [15]. Allikmets et al. [16] mapped the ABCG2 gene to human chromosome 4q22 using radiation hybrid analysis.
Candidate gene analysis suffers from population substructure. We estimated the identity by state over all SNPs, and only four individuals were shown to be biological relatives. Genetic studies in Asian populations may not identify the same set of genes as those in European populations [17]. Nevertheless, the Seoul City cohort study in Korean populations indicates that the ABCG2 gene on chromosome 4 is associated with serum uric acid levels, as is the case in several other populations.
