Epistasis detection using GPU-based Boolean Operation-based Screening and Testing
We applied GPU-based Boolean Operation-based Screening and Testing (GBOOST) to analyze epistatic interaction effects from the genomewide SNP data [6]. Stage I: screening-in the screening stage, BOOST evaluated all pairwise interactions using the Kirkwood superposition approximation. Stage 2: testing-pairs of epistatic loci with PBOOST ≤ 4.89e-06 were further evaluated by a logistic regression model to compute interaction effects [7]. After that, GBOOST conducted a χ2 test with four degrees of freedom (df = 4) and calculated p-values to determine whether the interaction effect was significant. The numbers of interactions tested were 226,507, 251,344, and 151,090 in DM, HT, and CAD, respectively; thus, the genome-wide significance levels were 4.41e-08, 3.98e-08, and 6.62e-08 using Bonferroni correction.
