The examples shown above point to the efficacy of our web service. However, a more thorough evaluation, while useful, is difficult. This is mainly due to the fact that manual creation of parsing annotations is prohibitively expensive, and the fact that existing annotated corpora are annotated in various incompatible formats. For example, depending on the annotation schema, conjunctions can be represented in various ways, or relationships may be either undirected or have opposite directionality. Even though there are efforts to homogenize annotation schemes, such as Universal Dependencies [16], they are not yet widely adopted. This makes automatic comparison of results very difficult. However, since dependency parsing is not usually a goal in itself, but a component used for downstream tasks, an extrinsic evaluation could be carried out on such a downstream task such as relation extraction.
