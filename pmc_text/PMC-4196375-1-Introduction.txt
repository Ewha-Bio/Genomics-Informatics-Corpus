In an aging society, osteoporosis is a major health problem. It is characterized by systemic impairment of bone mass, strength, and microarchitecture, leading to increased risk of fragility fractures, particularly hip fracture [1]. In the United States, the cost of incident fractures due to osteoporosis and low bone mass was $17 billion in 2006. It is expected to rise to around $25.3 billion by the year 2025 [2]. Likewise, the burden for them is prevalent in Asia. The annual incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures increased to 1,661, 1,646, 1,623, and 1,614 per 100,000 persons from 2005 to 2008 in Korea [3]. Osteoporosis is defined by the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), which is so far the best single predictor [4, 5].
BMD is a genetic component, with estimates of heritability ranging from 0.46 to 0.84 at all skeletal sites [6]. In recent years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have enhanced the understanding of the genetic architecture underlying quantitative traits and common, complex diseases [7]. These studies provide key insights into the variation of quantitative traits and prospects for designing specifically effective strategies for diseases [8]. There have been many GWASs to identify genetic loci that influence BMD, and dozens of candidates have been presented [9,10,11,12,13]. However, only several loci have been consistently identified in a few replication studies [14,15,16], suggesting that BMD is a complex trait affected by multiple components [17].
Recently, a meta-analysis of 17 studies for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine was performed for the first time in order to identify consensus BMD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout races [18]. It included 32,951 individuals across North America, Europe, East Asia, and Australia. The meta-analysis offered 56 associated loci that were highly significant in both the discovery stage and replication stage. This also proposed a model of BMD loci and successfully validated it with an independent population.
Here, we investigate those 56 BMD loci in a Korean population called Korea Association REsource (KARE) [19]. The analysis showed that BMD variation is a polygenic and complex trait, and it could be even different, depending on sex and the skeletal site. The finding that some crucial loci are still significant in KARE supports the validity of BMD loci. This study may contribute to the importance of a replication study in GWASs to understand the common mechanism underlying BMD.
