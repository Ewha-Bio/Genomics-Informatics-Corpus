The current effective population size was 100,778 using the total population. The estimate was much larger than the estimates using the HapMap data. The largest Ne in the populations of the HapMap data was 10,437 using CEUp (the parents of Utah, USA residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe). The estimate of the Korean population was approximately 10 times larger than the largest estimates using the HapMap data. From the definition, the effective population size is influenced by many factors, such as mating structure, migration, and admixture [1]. No big difference is expected in the mating structure between KARE and HapMap. Because Korean populations were relatively rarely admixed, the inflation of Ne due to admixture could be excluded. The effects of migration on Ne estimates were studied previously [35, 36]. The Ne, based on LD, which is more robust than the joint estimation of Ne and migration rate, could be overestimated to be close to the global (metapopulation) Ne when the migration rate is high [35].
After the Korean War, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) experienced severe urbanization and extreme population concentration in a metropolitan area [37]. The percentage of the population in an urban area was more than 70% of the total population in the late 1980s [37]. A high population density due to migration introduces good opportunities to meet a diverse partner within the population, which increases Ne. The population density of the Republic of Korea is among the highest among nations, ranking 20th among a total of 265 countries or areas (https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A14). Due to the Korean War and urbanization, the Gyeonggi province, located in the middle of the Korean peninsula, has experienced severe migration. Because the capital, Seoul, is located in the middle of Gyeonggi province, the region has also experienced a severe concentration of the population. These factors might explain the large effective population size.
Fig. 1 shows the LD status of the total population, the population of the urban area, and the population of the rural area, depending on recombination rates. In the previous study, the r2 decay plots of chromosome 14, depending on recombination rates, were prominently higher than the plots of other chromosomes [14]; however, in the current study, none of the Korean populations showed increases in the r2 estimates of chromosome 14 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1 for the age groups). However, when the region from 65,700 kb to 6,800 kb, which is responsible for the increases in the r2 estimates in the previous study, was examined, similar allele frequency spectra were seen (Fig. 2A). The frequency spectra show significant concentrations of specific minor allele frequencies (higher than 0.4), indicating selection pressures in the region. Other populations in the HapMap data showed similar trends of selection pressures, but the concentrated frequencies usually were less than 0.4 [14].
The most similar spectra among the HapMap data were JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) and CHB (Han Chinese in Beijing, China), and the frequency spectrum of KARE looked like a mixture of the spectra of JPT and CHB. In a previous study [14], CHD (Chinese in metropolitan Denver, CO, USA) was almost the same as CHB. Although the distributions were more dispersed, ASW (African ancestry in southwest USA) and MEX (Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, CA, USA) were similar to CHB. The genotype data were generated using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 [19]; however, the genotype data of the HapMap project were generated using two platforms of the Illumina Human 1M and the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 [38]. Because of the difference in the platforms used, the current study showed a smaller number of SNPs in the region (Fig. 2A). If the same platforms were used for genotyping, similar increases in the r2 estimates of chromosome 14 to JPT and CHB might be observed in Fig. 1 [14]. The region contains the complete gephyrin gene (GPHN). In Fig. 2B, a huge LD block of the region was observed using Haploview [39], similar to a previous study [14].
The past population history of the total population is shown in Fig. 1. Excluding the influence of current effective population size, the past population history of Koreans was similar to the CHB of the HapMap data. The results looked reasonable, considering the similarity of the modern histories between Korea and China, which include the resistance to Western civilizations and the short period of colonization. However, there is a huge difference between the current Ne of Korean populations and the current Ne of CHB. The current Ne of CHB was 2,926 [14]. The Chinese government has enforced a one-child policy since 1978; however, the Korean government encouraged a two-child policy without any forcible action [40]. These differences in policy might have resulted in significant differences in the current Ne sizes of the Korean and Chinese populations. The populations of both the urban and rural areas showed similar past population histories as that of the total population (Fig. 1).
Fig. 3 shows the estimates of the current and recent effective population sizes of various age groups. Because the initial sample collection was conducted from 2001 to 2003, the year of birth for individuals aged 69 to 40 would be 1933 to 1962, respectively, if the baseline year of collection were assumed to be 2002. Therefore, there could be inaccuracies of 1 or 2 years in assigning the year of birth. The recent Ne involves recent changes in the effective population sizes, usually within a few generations. Therefore, the recent effective population sizes were larger than the current effective population sizes in Fig. 3, because the current Ne of individuals born in a certain year merely represents the effective population size of the population born in a certain year. However, the recent Ne represents the effective population sizes of several previous generations. The current effective population sizes were mostly between 5,000 and 30,000, and the recent effective population sizes were usually higher than the current Ne and increased as the year of birth increased.
The current and recent Ne of samples with age 69 or older (born in 1933) was 9,457 and 20,165, respectively. For comparison, the maximum estimate of the current Ne of the HapMap data was 10,437. The current Ne of Koreans born in 1933 was already large, probably because of the high population density in Korea. The recent Ne, which is double the current Ne, indicates that the population growth of Korea lasted long before the colonial domination by Japan in 1910. There were two age groups of 58 and 63, for which the current Ne estimates were less than 5,000. The corresponding years are 1944 and 1939, respectively. World War II began in 1939 and ended in 1945, and comparatively fewer births would be expected during the period. However, there was a large increase of the current Ne in 1943, presenting a nettlesome question. There were several large increases of the current Ne in 1943, 1947, 1952, and 1958. The increases in 1947 and 1958 could be explained by the baby boom right after the wars; however, 1943 and 1952 were the 2 years and 1 year, respectively, before the end of the wars, which lasted for 6 and 3 years, respectively. The current and recent Ne estimates were compared to the number of the total population and to the rates of population growth recorded in the Korean Statistical Almanac of the Korean Statistical Information Service (http://kosis.kr). The rates of population growth fit with the increased current Ne in 1943 if the 1-year inaccuracies in assigning the year of birth are considered. The increments of the current Ne in 1943 and 1952 could be due to the decreased crude death rate and increased migration rates [37].
