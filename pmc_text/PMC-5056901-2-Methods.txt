Study subjects
All participants were of Korean ancestry. For the replication study, 656 SLE patients (males, 11; females, 645; age [mean ± SD], 33.7 ± 12.1 years) were recruited from the Rheumatology Center at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, South Korea. All patients had been diagnosed as having SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology-revised criteria for SLE [1718]. In addition, the allele frequencies for healthy Korean population as control were derived from the Korea Reference Genome Database (n=622). This study was performed under the approval of our institutional review board (MC12TIMI0026).
