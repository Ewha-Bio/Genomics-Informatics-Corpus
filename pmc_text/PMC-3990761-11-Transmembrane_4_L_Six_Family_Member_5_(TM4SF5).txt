TM4SF5-mediated gene regulation
Comparison of protein expression patterns between TM4SF5-null and -expressing cells shows a negative correlation between TM4SF5 and cell-cell adhesion-related molecules of epithelial markers, including E-cadherin [74], and a positive correlation between TM4SF5 and mesenchymal markers, including Slug [79], supporting TM4SF5-mediated EMT. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of show that TM4SF5-mediated regulation of their expressions occurs at the transcriptional level (Lee JW, unpublished observation). However, the signaling pathways underlying this regulation have not been determined yet.
In addition, TM4SF5 expression also correlates with cytosolic p27Kip1 [74]. Although p27Kip1 in the nucleus is inhibitory to cyclin-dependent kinases, suppressing the cell cycle and proliferation, its localization in the cytosol can lead to tumorigenic functions [85]. Cytosolic p27Kip1 has been reported in different clinical reports, where different cancer types show enriched cytosolic localization of p27Kip1 [86, 87, 88], suggesting that cytosolic p27Kip1 can be tumorigenic [89]. p27Kip1 can be phosphorylated by Akt, KIS, or JNK [90, 91, 92], resulting in translocalization and stabilization in the cytosol, where it binds to and inactivates RhoA GTPase, leading to alterations in actin organization and motility regulation [93]. TM4SF5 expression also causes overexpression of p27Kip1, although how it occurs is unknown; TM4SF5 causes Akt-mediated Ser10 phosphorylation of p27Kip1, leading to its stabilization, RhoA activity changes, and eventually morphological elongation for the EMT and contact inhibition loss [74]. JNK-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation in a TM4SF5-dependent manner also results in localization of p27Kip1 at cell-cell contacts [91], possibly leading to altered actin organization at cell-cell contacts. In addition, inhibition of the proteasome in terms of activity and subunit expression also depends on TM4SF5 expression, resulting in morphological changes and the EMT, suggesting another novel mechanism for TM4SF5-mediated EMT [79].
Meanwhile, TM4SF5 causes activation of the FAK/c-Src signaling pathways, leading to STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 for the induction and secretion of VEGF, which can stimulate neighboring endothelial cells for enhanced (tumor) angiogenesis [72]. During modeling of the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells overexpressing TM4SF5 appear to negatively regulate expression of the cytokine IL6, and exogenous IL6 treatment leads to less STAT3 signaling activation in TM4SF5-positive cancer cells (Ryu J and Lee JW, in revision); thus, TM4SF5-dependent suppression of IL6 can be a strategy for TM4SF5-positive tumor cells to avoid pro-immunological actions by IL6 secreted by neighboring immune cells. As for invasion, TM4SF5 expression also increases the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2, in addition to its activity [77].
Therefore, TM4SF5 expression correlates with or plays important roles in tumorigenesis in different mechanisms, including induction of the EMT and gene regulation (Fig. 2).
