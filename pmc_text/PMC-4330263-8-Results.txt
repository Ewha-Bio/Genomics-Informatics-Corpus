Estimated heritability
We estimated the narrow-sense heritability (h2) using simple regression between the genetic values and the height phenotypic values. The heritability was 0.24 in G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP and 0.20 in SNP-BLUP. According to Yang et al.'s article [2], only 45% of variance can be explained by total SNPs. Therefore, our estimated heritability was not poor, and of the generally accepted narrow-sense heritability of 0.8, we explained 33% in G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP. We explained 53% of the heritability when using total SNPs. Also, we found the method that is widely applicable, SNP-GBLUP, because it can predict the SNP effects. It is impossible in G-BLUP, and Gu matrix components can be used widely, such as in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), because they can be interpreted as representing the interaction terms between SNPs.
