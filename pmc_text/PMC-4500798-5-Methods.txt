Molecular interaction between miRNAs and AGO protein
To illustrate the assistance of catalytic AGO protein for the binding of miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) with the HOXA9 gene, docking between AGO protein and miRNA-mRNA duplexes was performed in the PachDock online server [16]. The PachDock algorithm ranked the docked complexes on the basis of geometrical shape complementary scores. Close amino acid residue interactions and participating atoms in hydrogen bonding were inspected and analyzed in the Discovery Studio 3.5 suite (http://accelrys.com/products/discovery-studio/visualization-download.php).
