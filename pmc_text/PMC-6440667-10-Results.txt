Overall comparison of the various machine learning tools
We used six machine learning methods, namely, MLP, NB, RF, decision tree classification, and SVM. Table 3 summarizes the performance of each model obtained with the various machine learning tools in the training and test sets. The purpose of generating our models is to provide a warning for a nonobese person who has an increased risk for metabolic syndrome. Therefore, we evaluated the sensitivity of the designed model. NB showed the best sensitivity, 0.38 for model A and 0.42 for model B. The specificity of NB was 0.79 for model A and 0.80 for model B.
