Neuropeptides, which signal between neurons, are known to be involved in a variety of physiological processes, including addiction, depression, hunger, pain, fear, anxiety, and circadian rhythms [12]. Neuropeptides are 3â€“100 amino acid residues long and up to 50 times larger than classic neurotransmitters [3]. The term "neuropeptides" was first introduced by De Wied [4] in 1971 to describe an endogenous peptide synthesized in nerve cells. While peptide hormones are also considered important intercellular signaling molecules, there are differences between neuropeptides and peptide hormones. That is, neuropeptides are secreted from neuronal cells (primarily neurons but also glia for some peptides) and signal to neighboring cells (primarily neurons), whereas peptide hormones are secreted from neuroendocrine cells and act on distant tissues by traveling through the blood [25]. Approximately 100 different neuropeptides are currently known to function in cell-to-cell signaling (http://www.neuropeptides.nl). Neuropeptides bind to post-synaptic receptors and elicit cellular responses like classical neurotransmitters.
