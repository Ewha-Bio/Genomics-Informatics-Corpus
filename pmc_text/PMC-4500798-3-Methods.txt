Selection of miRNAs targeting the HOXA9 gene
Firstly, from the literature, the miRNAs with affinity for the HOXA9 gene were identified [1213], which was further verified by prediction of miRNA target sites in the HOXA9 gene using the miRTarBase web server (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/). The search showed four miRNAs-namely, mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b-that have target sites within HOXA9 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Two different binding sites were identified for mir-196b in the HOXA9 gene, denoted mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2, respectively.
