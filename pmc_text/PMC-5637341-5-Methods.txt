Interpretation
CNVs were categorized as pathogenic, benign, and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) by considering gene content, size, inheritance pattern, and previously reported microdeletion or microduplication regions. University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser was employed to check all of the information relevant to the locations of the CNVs. dbVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar) and the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/) were consulted to check clinically relevant structural variations and determine whether the observed CNVs were of clinical significance. We considered CNVs to be causative if the variant was responsible for a known syndrome; encompassed a gene(s) of known function; or occurred de novo or, if inherited, the parent was variably affected or if the involved gene(s) had been reported to be associated with ID/DD/ASDs in public databases and the scientific literature. The term VUS was used if the variants affected a gene(s) of unknown clinical significance and if, at same time, the size was substantially less than 100 kb (the average resolution of the probes used) and when the family studies were inconclusive or unavailable [9].
