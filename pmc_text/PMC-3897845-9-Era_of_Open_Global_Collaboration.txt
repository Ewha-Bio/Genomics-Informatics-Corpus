One major difference between the EMR community and BI community is the degree of multidisciplinary open collaboration. In EMRs, multidisciplinary collaborative efforts have been limited. Most of the EMR systems in use today are based on proprietary software that hampers data exchange with other systems. In the BI community, global collaboration, aided by wide use of open source software and development methodologies, has been a key success factor. The BI community has been global in scope from the beginning, and information sharing and free exchange of software tools have ushered in the era of open source software in health informatics. There is a great need for the EMR community to adopt more open source software methodologies that would allow rapid global collaboration (http://www.osehra.org).
