Evolutionary conservation of the Peg3 imprinted domain. The 500-kb genomic interval of the Peg3 domain is shown using the mouse genomic region as a representative locus, along with its relative position in mouse chromosome 7 (Mmu7). The paternally expressed and maternally expressed genes are indicated with blue and red arrows, respectively. The three differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are indicated with grey boxes. The 20 evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) are shown with vertical blue lines, except ECR18 in red. The graph in the middle represents the sequence conservation levels of the Peg3 domain among placental mammals. The table below summarizes the evolutionary conservation of gene content and their open reading frames (ORFs) with different colors: black for conserved and green for non-conserved. The first two exons of mouse Usp29 were previously named ossification center-associated transcript (Ocat), while those in humans and cow are named MER1 repeat-containing imprinted transcript 1 (MIMT1). aThe ORF indicates the loss of the USP29 ORF in one human population.
