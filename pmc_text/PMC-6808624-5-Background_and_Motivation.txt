The LAPPS Grid
The LAPPS Grid [3] provides a large collection of NLP tools exposed as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) web services, together with a variety of resources commonly used in the domain. The services are made available to users via a web-based workflow development engine (https://galaxy.lappsgrid.org), directly via SOAP calls, and programmatically through Java and Python interfaces. All tools and resources in the LAPPS Grid are rendered mutually interoperable via transduction to the JSON-LD LAPPS Grid Interchange Format (LIF [11]) and the Web Service Exchange Vocabulary (WSEV [12]), both designed to capture fundamental properties of existing annotation models in order to serve as a common pivot among them. The basic annotation model underlying the LIF format includes document-level metadata, text, and a set of views, where a view consists of an ID, a list of annotations, and view-specific metadata. LIF documents are meant to be passed along a pipeline of NLP components, where each component creates a new view and adds its annotations to it. Existing views cannot be modified, but their annotations may be copied to a new view if necessary to add or modify names and/or attribute values.
