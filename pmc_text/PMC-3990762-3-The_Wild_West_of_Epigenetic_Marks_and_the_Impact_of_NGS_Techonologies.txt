The will of the global scientific community to sequence the human genome spurred advances in sequencing technologies that led to what is now known as NGS. The improvement in cost and speed of sequencing in the last decade has significantly surpassed the analogous improvement in computer technologies as predicted by Moore's law [12]. Well beyond the initial goal of sequencing complete genomes of several species, NGS is now routinely used as a tool to investigate the diverse array of cellular events involving DNA or RNA, such as the identification of genomic loci bound by a specific protein, the detection of pairs of spatially proximal or interacting chromosomal loci, etc. Broad availability of NGS technologies has led to a paradigm shift in molecular biology research; from probing singular cellular events to an unbiased genome-scale mapping of such events, and has enabled genome-wide elucidation of the epigenomic landscapes in hundreds of cell types, across developmental times, in human, as well as other species [13].As mentioned earlier, it is the locus-specific "epigenetic code" (a specific signature or combination of several epigenetic modifications) that helps define a cell's expression program and identity [14], thereby distinguishing it from other cell types. Unlike the largely static genome of an individual, the epigenome is highly variable and dynamic; yet, many of these marks can be passed down a cell's lineage, or from one generation to the next. In this section, we describe several well-studied epigenomic marks and outline what is known about their role in gene expression modulation. We will also outline various NGS-based assays that are used in comprehensively mapping each of the epigenetic marks (Table 1) [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34].
