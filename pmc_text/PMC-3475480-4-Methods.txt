Delivery methods
The transfection agent was in vivo-jetPEI™ (Polyplus, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France). Per the manufacturer, 25 µg siRNA and 6.5 µL vivo-jetPEI™ (N/P charge ratio of 6) were diluted with 50 µL 10% glucose solution and 50 µL sterile H2O. The solution was vortexed gently and left for 15 min at RT. The mixture was injected into the tail veins of 7- to 9-week-old mice, and the treated mice were measured for blood pressure or sacrificed for RNA extraction.
