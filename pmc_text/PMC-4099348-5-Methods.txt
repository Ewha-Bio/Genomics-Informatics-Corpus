Multiple displacement amplification
Genomic fragments were circularized by incubating the beads with 1× Ampligase reaction buffer, 0.25 U/µL Ampligase (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), and 0.1 µg/µL BSA in a total volume of 50 µL at 55℃ for 10 min. The circularized molecules were separated from the beads by incubation with 5 µL sample buffer at 95℃ for 10 min and collected with a ring magnet rack. The supernatant was incubated with 5 µL reaction buffer and 0.2 µL enzyme mix (Templiphi; GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 30℃ for 4 h, followed by inactivation at 65℃ for 10 min.
