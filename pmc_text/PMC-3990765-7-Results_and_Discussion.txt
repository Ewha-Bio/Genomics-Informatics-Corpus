Genotype features
We obtained 58,960 Pan-Asian SNPs from 72 Pan-Asian populations listed in the supplementary documents (Supplementary Table 1). The SNP dataset shows the spectrum of genetic and phenotypic diversity in Asian populations and allows us determine the ethnic specificity of Asian populations based on ESNP and CNP makers.
We devised an approach to identify ethnic differences from the genotype profiles of the populations. Pan-Asian SNPs were filtered using several steps, as described in Materials and Methods. With the filtered SNPs, we examined the inter-SNP distances, the allele frequency, and the heterozygosity distribution to identify the genotypic features of each ethnic group. The average inter-SNP distance was 52 kb. More than 41% of SNPs fell below 10 kb, and 14% was over 100 kb (Supplementary Fig. 3). The inter-SNP distance distribution within 10 kb of one another was similar to the distribution observed in the HapMap data.
We investigated minor allele frequency and heterozygosity across the ethnic groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). We compared SNP genotypes in the ethnic groups with those identified by the HapMap [17] consortium. The proportion of Pan-Asian SNPs in each minor allele frequency and heterozygosity range was similar to those of the 4 HapMap ethnic groups. In particular, the SNP proportions for CN-UG, Proto-Austroloids (IN-DR), and Singapore Indian (SG-ID) were almost the same as those of the 4 HapMap ethnic groups. We found that 5 ethnic groups (America Melanesians [AX-ME], Thailand Mlabri [TH-MA], Indonesia Mentawai [ID-MT], CN-UG, and SG-ID) had minor allele frequency and heterozygosity distributions that were significantly different from those of other ethnic groups. Approximately 40% of the SNPs in the AX-ME, TH-MA, and ID-MT populations fell into the <0.05 range. The proportion of SNPs with heterozygosity <0.05 was lowest in the CN-UG and SG-ID groups, whereas the proportion of SNPs with heterozygosity <0.10 was highest in the TH-MA and AX-ME groups.
