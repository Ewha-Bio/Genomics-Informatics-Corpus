Library preparation and Ion Proton sequencing
Targeted gene sequencing was performed as previously described [11]. Ten nanograms of the DNA preparations was used as a template for multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a 409-gene panel covering coding regions (Ion AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA).
Fragment libraries were constructed by DNA fragmentation, barcode and adaptor ligation, and library amplification using the Ion DNA Barcoding kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The size distribution of the DNA fragments was analyzed using a bioanalyzer and the High Sensitivity kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Using the Ion Xpress Template kit (Life Technologies), we performed template preparation, emulsion PCR, and Ion Sphere Particle (ISP) enrichment according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ISPs were loaded onto a P1 chip and sequenced using an Ion P1 sequencing kit (Life Technologies).
