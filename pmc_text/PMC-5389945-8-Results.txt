Selection of highly polymorphic autosomal and mitochondrial SNPs as donor-specific DNA markers
Several studies have used genetic signature detection of transplanted organs based on SNPs [8101516]. However, it is still not clear how many SNPs should be genotyped for accurate detection of donor-specific DNA in transplant patients. In this study, we tested the ability of 27 highly polymorphic SNPs used for human identification to distinguish donor-specific DNA from paired transplant patient DNA. To determine the appropriate number of SNPs for donor-specific DNA detection, we screened the genotypes of the 27 SNPs, and the genotypes of two additional sex-specific SNPs used for sex determination (AMEL-1 & ZF-1). The genomic DNA of three kidney donor and recipient pairs was analyzed by capillary sequencing (Table 1). In the case of a transplant between unrelated individuals (patient 1, wife to husband), among 27 markers, 11 donor-specific SNPs (five homozygous and six heterozygous alleles; 40.7%) were identified. However, in case of transplants between related individuals (patient 2 and patient 3, both cases are transplants from mother to daughter), seven and six heterozygous SNPs (25.9% and 22.2% of alleles tested) were detected as donor-specific markers, respectively (Table 1). These data indicate that using approximately 24% of the highly polymorphic SNPs used to identify individuals would be sufficient to detect donor-specific DNA in transplant monitoring, even in transplants between related individuals.
The detection of nuclear DNA is not easy due to limited amounts of donor DNA in plasma or urine cfDNA samples. However, high copy numbers of the mitochondrial genome are usually present in cfDNA samples. In order to identify candidate mtDNA variants as donor-specific DNA markers, we selected 19 highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs with high minor allele frequency (MAF > 0.20) at mtDB (http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se/) and one in-house mtDNA variant data with MAF > 0.30 (n = 24 Korean DNA samples). For the detection of donor-specific DNA in plasma or urine cfDNA samples after transplantation, a total of seven highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs were finally selected based on having high MAFs (> 0.2) in additional Korean DNA samples (n = 38), and following exclusion of three tightly linked variants (linkage with r2 = 1) (Table 2).
