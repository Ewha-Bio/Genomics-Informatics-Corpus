Gene filtration
Gene filtration for low expression is important because it can reduce false positives [12]. Sampling noise that is added during the sequencing process can also be removed by gene filtration. In this study, a 20% zero proportion threshold was selected, as this value is commonly chosen in previous studies [13]. Gene filtration was performed only on the training set.
