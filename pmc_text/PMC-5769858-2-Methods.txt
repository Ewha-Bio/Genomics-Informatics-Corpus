Selection of artificial leader peptides
In previous work (patent WO 2004/044206 A1), a formula for constructing a leader peptide was proposed as follows: Met-Thr-Met-Ile-Thr···Lys(Arg). We selected 13 models, as shown in Table 1. Out of these 13 models, 5 have been used to generate experimental results in a previous work [7], and 7 are being introduced in this work.
