Sequence source
Cryptosporidium parvum strain Iowa type II (NCBI taxonomy accession 353152) was chosen for this study. One of its genes, cgd2_1810, encodes CysQ, a sulfite synthesis pathway protein (accession no. XP_001388206) [12]. The protein sequence was retrieved from the NCBI Protein Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein).
