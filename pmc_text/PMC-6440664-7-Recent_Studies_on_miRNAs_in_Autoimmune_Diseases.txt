Early rheumatoid arthritis
Whole sera in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) patients (n = 34) were compared with established RA (n = 28) and HC (n = 16) in an analysis of miR-146a, miR-155, miR-223, miR-16, miR-203, miR-132 and miR-124a expression by TaqMan qRT-PCR [13]. The levels of circulating miR-146a, miR-155 and miR-16 were decreased in the sera of ERA patients in comparison with established RA. Levels of circulating miR-223 in treatment naive ERA patients correlated with disease activity. However, neither miR-16 nor miR-223 could distinguish ERA from HC. The authors concluded that circulating miR-146a, miR-155, and miR-16 in the sera of ERA could indicate an early stage of the disease.
