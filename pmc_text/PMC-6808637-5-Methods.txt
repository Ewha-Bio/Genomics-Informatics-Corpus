Gene ontology analysis
The gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) [17]. The gene catalogue was retrieved from Ensembl DB (http://www.ensembl.org). We selected the genes with the highest and lowest TC (top and bottom 5% in TC values) for the GO analysis.
