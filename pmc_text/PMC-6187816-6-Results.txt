As a means to proving Markov property, we directly investigated whether our sequence-based Markov chain models for each chromatin state have the discriminating power necessary to identify different chromatin states.
The samples were stratified according to chromosomes into strictly non-overlapping training and testing sets. A total of 6,334,977 200-bp units were trained, and 703,886 200-bp units were tested for prediction accuracy. At this time, reverse complements of sequences were not considered when building the Markov models, since the backward Markov chain could show similar properties for solutions.
Table 2 shows the result: 52.86% precision for Promoter states, 37.95% precision for Transcribed states, and 59.82% for Enhancer states. These percentages were obtained by adding all units that were predicted correctly as a dominant state in each of the 200-bp units divided by the number of all testing units in the same broad group.
By estimating the prediction accuracy of chromatin states, we infer that the Promoter states showed reasonable Markov property, the Repressed state did not seem to display Markov property, and those units related to the Enhancer states (4, 5, 6, and 7 states) were the most tissue specific, whereas those related to the Transcription states (9, 10, and 11 states) were highly constitutive.
