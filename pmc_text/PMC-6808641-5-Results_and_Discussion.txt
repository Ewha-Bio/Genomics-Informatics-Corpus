Concordance between the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000
We checked the concordance of the RNA-seq data produced by the two platforms using two methods: principal component analysis (PCA) of the eight samples, and pairwise correlation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). When we performed PCA of the eight samples, we found that the four pairs of samples were located close to each other, showing that no significant biases existed between the two sequencing platforms (Fig. 1). Then, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of the four pairs and found that all four pairs of samples showed high correlation coefficients, ranging from 0.98 to 0.99 (Fig. 2). Thus, we found that the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000 produced highly reproducible data from the same samples without significant platform-specific biases.
