Functional classification of KEGG pathways
For the KEGG analysis, 17,583 annotated transcripts were mapped to identify the active pathways in C. japonicum at a cut-off E-value < 0.00001. Of these transcripts, 9,418 transcripts had significant matches in the database and were assigned to 137 KEGG pathways. Metabolism had the most unigenes; amino acid metabolism had the highest number of annotated unigenes, followed by carbohydrate metabolism, xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism, lipid metabolism, biosynthesis of antibiotics, etc. (Table 3). These annotations provide insight into the transcriptome by enhancing our understanding of the specific functions and pathways in C. japonicum.
