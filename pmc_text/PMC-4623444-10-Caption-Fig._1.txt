The volcano plot showing the transcriptional changes between before and after insulin treatment. The -log10(p-value) of paired t test and log2 gene expression fold changes between before and after the treatment in insulin sensitive individuals were plotted on the x- and y-axis, respectively. The genes colored by cyan are selected using the threshold of t test -log10(p-value) and log2(FC) of fold change [-log10(p-value) < 2 (corresponding to FDR19 â‰¤ 0.05) and log2(FC) > 0.2630344]. FC, fold change.
