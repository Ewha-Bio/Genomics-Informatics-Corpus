Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
The beta version of GSEA software and MSigDB 5.2 were downloaded from the Broad Institute (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). GSEA was carried out as described previously [9]. Enrichment of gene sets was considered statistically significant if the normalized p-value was < 0.01 and the false discovery rate (FDR) was < 0.20.
