Homology modeling of ER and KR domains
The pairwise sequence alignments between the template and the targets (human ER and KR) were built using MODELLER 9v7 [17, 18]. Further, the aligned target-template file was used to generate homology models. A total of 100 initial models were generated for both the ER and KR domains. The qualities of these models were ranked based on discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) score generated by MODELER 9v7 [17]. The models showing the lowest DOPE score was chosen as the best model. Further, these best models of the ER and KR domains were processed using the 'Protein Preparation Wizard' module of Schrodinger Suite (Schr√∂dinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA) to correct the structural defects, to add and optimize hydrogen atoms, to assign bond orders, and also to selectively assign tautomerization and ionization states.
