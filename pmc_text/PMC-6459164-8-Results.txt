Reduction of heterogeneity of COPD samples
A workflow, including the prediction of estimates and the deconvolution process, was set up to resolve the issue of complexity (Fig. 2A). The critical steps in the pipeline were the prediction of estimates and deconvolution. The deconvolution process was originally designed to estimate the proportions of known sample types in a mixture of multiple samples. By assuming the RNA-seq data of our 98 COPD and 91 normal samples to be a mixture, the deconvolution process was applied to extract the unique profile of COPD samples. Having many samples was helpful to increase the accuracy. Then, integrative statistical test was performed to identify confident DEGs. p-values from the three tests were combined by POINTILLIST [16].
In order to confirm the effect of the deconvolution, expression levels of known marker genes were re-evaluated (Fig. 2B). The p-values of gene expression differences in the FGA, FGG, IL6, and CXCL8 genes were not changed. Immune receptors associated with smoking kept their higher expression levels in COPD versus normal tissue. However, in contrast to Fig. 1B, C-reactive protein (CRP) and Î²-fibrinogen (FGB) were now up-regulated in COPD. SFTPD was significantly down-regulated in COPD. The expression levels of TNF and CSF2 were not significantly different between COPD and normal tissue. These results suggest that the gene expression profiles of heterogeneous samples can be normalized in good agreement with known patterns through the deconvolution process.
