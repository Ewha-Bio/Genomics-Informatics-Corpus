Our data showed that NS-398 treatment up-regulated the gene set involved in the TNFR2 pathway (Table 2, Fig. 2A, Supplementary Table 1). This pathway is well known to activate the NF-κB signaling that mediates cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, inflammation, differentiation, or development (Supplementary Fig. 1) [13]. NF-κB, a transcription factor, has been reported to regulate cellular senescence though its role in the senescence is controversial. Overexpression of c-Rel resulted in premature senescence in normal human keratinocytes [14]. On the contrary, mouse embryonic fibroblasts from NF-κB1 knockout mice showed enhanced cellular senescence [15]. In addition, siRNA against NF-κB2 or RelB induced premature senescence in HDFs in a p53-dependent manner [16]. These studies suggest that the anti-senescent effect of NS-398 might be attributable to a regulation of NF-κB signaling.
NS-398 treatment also up-regulated the gene set involved in the fructose and mannose metabolism (Table 2, Supplementary Table 2). This metabolic pathway leads to enhanced glycolysis and N-glycan biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 2). Alterations of glucose metabolism have been reported in cellular senescence though the data is conflicting. In human mammary epithelial cells, B-Raf–induced premature senescence was associated with a reduction of glucose uptake, and overexpression of hexokinase 2 prevented the oncogene-induced senescence [17]. On the contrary, glucose consumption and hexokinase activity were increased in senescent HDFs as compared to young HDFs [18]. These studies suggest that NS-398 might delay cellular senescence via regulation of glycolysis.
It is intriguing that the gene set involved in protein secretion is down-regulated by NS-398 treatment but is up-regulated by aspirin treatment (Tables 3 and 6, Figs. 2B and 4A, Supplementary Tables 4 and 12). It has been reported that cellular senescence is accompanied by an increase in the secretion of intercellular signaling molecules including interleukins, chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and extracellular matrix proteins [1920]. For example, production of interleukin-1, -6, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -12, -13, -16, -20, -26, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -8, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, connective tissue growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, matrix metalloproteinase-1, -3, -10, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, or fibronectin increased in senescent HDFs as compared to in young HDFs [21]. Ectopic expression of chemokine receptors such as CXCR1 or CXCR2 induced premature senescence in HDFs [22]. Extracellular matrix from young HDFs restored senescent HDFs to an apparently youthful state [23]. In addition, there is a report that p16-induced senescence is accompanied by an increase in the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in mouse and human pancreatic beta cells [24]. These studies suggest that regulation of protein secretion might be an important common mechanism by which NS-398 delays but aspirin accelerates cellular senescence.
In addition to the up-regulation of protein secretion, aspirin down-regulated gene sets involved in DNA-dependent RNA transcription (Table 7, FDR, 0.062 and 0.088; Table 8, FDR, 0.061 and 0.197; Fig. 4B). Compatible with these results, a cDNA microarray study reported that genes involved in transcription were down-regulated specifically during senescence in HDFs [25]. In addition, there is a report that RNA transcription was decreased in aged rat brain as compared to in young rat brain [26]. Therefore, aspirin might accelerate cellular senescence by downregulation of DNA-dependent RNA transcription.
It is well known that aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation and thereby thrombus formation [27]. Consistent with this, our data showed that the gene set involved in platelet aggregation was down-regulated by aspirin treatment (Table 8, FDR, 0.179).
Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are categorized into two families, that is, the Ink4 family including p15, p16, p18, and p19, and the Cip/Kip family including p21, p27, and p57. It has been reported that these CKIs are actively involved in cellular senescence. For example, ectopic expression of p15, p16, p19, p21, or p27 was reported to induce premature senescence in HDFs [2829]. According to our data, celecoxib treatment up-regulated gene sets relating G2M checkpoint and E2F targets (Table 4, Fig. 3A). In addition, CDKN1B encoding p27 and CDKN2C encoding p18 were enriched in both gene sets (Supplementary Table 7, Running enrichment score [ES], 0.410 and 0.274; Supplementary Table 8, Running ES, 0.299 and 0.193). These data suggest that celecoxib might accelerate cellular senescence through up-regulation of CKIs.
Collectively, our results suggest that COX inhibitors modulate cellular senescence by different mechanisms though they have the anti-catalytic activity commonly. We believe that our study will provide useful information to understand senescence-modulating mechanisms of COX inhibitors.
