Identification of gender-discordant samples from the analysis of gender-specific gene expression
To see if the same problem occurs in other types of data (e.g., gene expression), we collected gene expression microarray data from the NCBI GEO database using a similar strategy for methylation microarray data (Fig. 4). By applying the same criteria as with the DNA methylation data, we collected a total of 1,683 samples from 4 datasets produced using the Affymetrix U133Plus2 array platform (Table 2).
We analyzed the 1,683 samples using several gender-specific genes (X (inactive)-specific transcript [XIST], eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, Y-linked [EIF1AY], and DEAD [Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp] box polypeptide 3, Y-linked [DDDX3Y]) [10] and found that 40 samples (2.3%) from 3 datasets were erroneously described (Fig. 5). In the case of Y chromosome markers, some discordant male samples showed overlapping distribution of methylation levels compared with normal male samples. Those samples needed to be compared samples with male sex abnormality syndromes (e.g., Klinefelter syndrome), but unfortunately, we could not find datasets with male sex abnormality syndromes produced using the same platform. However, as these samples showed the opposite pattern in X chromosome markers, we considered them to be putative discordant samples. But, further validation will be needed to confirm these samples.
Unlike the previous methylation data, some of the collected gene expression datasets contained technical replicates of the same samples (Table 2). Surprisingly, discordant gender-specific expression patterns were even observed from some of the technically replicated samples (Supplementary Fig. 6).
