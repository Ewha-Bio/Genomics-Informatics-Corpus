Computational algorithm used for annotating function of 39 hypothetical proteins (HPs) from Shigella flexneri. The framework has been divided into three phases: PHASE I, sequence retrieval from online databases; PHASE II, the extensive analysis of sub-cellular localization, physicochemical parameters, virulence, function and domain present in HPs; PHASE III, assessment of the predicted functions using the protein with known function from S. flexneri and reliable prediction of possible functions of HPs.
