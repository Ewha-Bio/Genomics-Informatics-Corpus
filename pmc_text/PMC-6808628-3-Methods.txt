In order to link the OHDSI vocabulary with UMLS, we will leverage Ananke [10], a resource built for the mapping of UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) into OHDSI concept_id’s, which are the unique identifiers assigned to all concepts in the vocabulary. This will allow us to use BioPortals URI’s for the CUIs and make the necessary connections when using their SPARQL endpoints for federated queries. All other Python 2.7 code just iterates through the vocabulary concepts, find proper UMLS matches and writes out each entry using a predefined schema. The conversion process assumes the OHDSI vocabulary files are in the same folder, as well as the Ananke mappings. If the researcher does not have a full copy of the OHDSI vocabulary, we provide an already built RDF graph for Vocabulary version v5.0 11-FEB-19.
