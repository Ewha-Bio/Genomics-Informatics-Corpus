TC calculation and GO analysis
Table 1 shows the summary statistics (minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation) of GWAS beta effect, TPM and TC. Table 2. shows the gene information with the lowest p-values (<0.0001) and the estimated TC. The TC was simply calculated using Eq. (2). Table 3 illustrates genes’ TC information of the highest p-values (top 5% genes in TC value). The neuronal genes including neuronal-activity regulated genes have important functions in dendrites and synapses and are likely to regulate circuit connectivity directly. Thus for the easy regulation of circuit connectivity, they might have the strategy through possessing low transcript reads and high TC [18]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; TC, 1.88 BF%) encodes a neurotrophin that is secreted at the synapse. The induction of BDNF promotes both synapse maturation and dendritic growth. BDNF had high TC and its mutation can cause neurological and psychiatric disorders [18]. Table 4 shows the GO with the lowest TC (bottom 5% genes). It shows that the lowest TC’s major GO terms were endoderm formation, wound healing and embryo development. The von Willebrand factor (VWF) is not an enzyme and thus, has no catalytic activity (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Willebrand_factor). In our analysis, the VWF had high transcript reads and low TC (TPM, 155.1; TC, 0.002 BF%).
