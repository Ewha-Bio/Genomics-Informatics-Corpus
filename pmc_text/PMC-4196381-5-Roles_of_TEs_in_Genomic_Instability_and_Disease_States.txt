TEs can cause genomic instability either by insertions or by rearrangements in the genome. Notably, structural variations in the human genome are the primary cause of inter-individual variability. Structural variations include insertion, deletion, inversion, duplication, and translocation. The characteristics of TEs, such as abundance in the genome, high sequence identity, and ability to move, make them major contributors to genomic instability [5, 27, 43]. Recent studies have revealed the implications of TEs in genomic instability and human genome evolution [44]. Mutations associated with TE insertions are well studied, and approximately 0.3% of all mutations are caused by retrotransposon insertions [27]. Such insertions can be deleterious by disrupting the regulatory sequences of a gene. When a TE inserts within an exon, it may change the ORF, such that it codes for an aberrant peptide, or it may even cause missense or nonsense mutations. On the other hand, if it is inserted into an intronic region, it may cause an alternative splicing event by introducing novel splice sites, disrupting the canonical splice site, or introducing a polyadenylation signal [8, 9, 10, 11, 42, 43]. In some instances, TE insertion into intronic regions can cause mRNA destabilization, thereby reducing gene expression [45]. Similarly, some studies have suggested that TE insertion into the 5' or 3' region of a gene may alter its expression [46, 47, 48]. Thus, such a change in gene expression may, in turn, change the equilibrium of regulatory networks and result in disease conditions (reviewed in Konkel and Batzer [43]).
The currently active non-LTR transposons, L1, SVA, and Alu, are reported to be the causative factors of many genetic disorders, such as hemophilia, Apert syndrome, familial hypercholesterolemia, and colon and breast cancer (Table 1) [8, 10, 11, 27]. Among the reported TE-mediated genetic disorders, X-linked diseases are more abundant than autosomal diseases [11, 27, 45], most of which are caused by L1 insertions. However, the phenomenon behind L1 and X-linked genetic disorders has not yet been revealed. The breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene, associated with breast and ovarian cancers, has been reported to be disrupted by multiple non-LTR TE insertions [9, 18, 49]. There are some reports that the same location of a gene may undergo multiple insertions (e.g., Alu and L1 insertions in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene) (Table 1).
It has also been proposed that inverted repeats are likely to be hotspots of genomic instability [50]. Closely occurring Alu repeats form hairpin structures that are prone to double-strand breaks (DSBs) and excision [50, 51]. In addition, de novo Alu insertions may create new inverted repeats that result in rearrangements in future generations [43]. Due to the abundance of TEs in the human genome, the probability of TE-mediated NAHR translocations is high. Kolomietz et al. [52] reported that Alu elements are often found in and around the breakage points of translocations and result in diseases [53]. Some studies have analyzed the human genome using the chimpanzee reference genome and found that deletions that are caused by Alu-mediated NAHRs are 9 times more frequent than L1-mediated NAHRs in the human genome [54, 55]. Alu-mediated NAHRs are known to be associated with various genetic disorders and cancer (Table 1) [8, 10]. L1 endonuclease creates abundant DSBs that are required for retrotransposition in mammalian cells and eventually contribute to genomic instability [56]. However, it has been difficult to define this in an experimental condition, as physiological conditions cannot be simulated in vitro. Moreover, it is also difficult to distinguish DSBs caused by L1 from DSBs caused by other mechanisms in vivo [44, 56].
From recent studies, it is apparent that the methylation state of DNA is associated with cancer [57]. TEs-in particular, the promoters of L1 elements-are reported to be demethylated in cancer cells [58, 59]. On the other hand, the methylation of retrotransposons is supposed to be a defense mechanism against retrotransposition in somatic cells [60]. It has also been reported by some studies that the L1 transcription rate is increased in hypomethylated cancer cells [58, 61]. Demethylation of TE promoters may result in their activation, which in turn could modify the TF level in the cell. It is possible that such changes in TF levels lead to alterations in global gene expression [57]. In addition, demethylation may result in the activation of the L1 antisense promoter, which may eventually produce cancerassociated chimeric transcripts [62, 63].
