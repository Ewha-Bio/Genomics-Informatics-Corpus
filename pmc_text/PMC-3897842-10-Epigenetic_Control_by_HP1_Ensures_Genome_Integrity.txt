Pleiotropic functions of HP1
Besides heterochromatin formation and the maintenance functions of HP1, this protein also recruits the cohesin complex to pericentromeric heterochromatin for centromeric sister chromatid cohesion. Recent studies have shown that HP1 does not always act in the context of heterochromatin and functions in gene activation and telomere maintenance [38]. Furthermore, HP1 interacts with many different proteins, including transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and DNA replication and repair factors, as well as components of the nuclear envelope [54], and functions via collaboration with its interacting proteins in diverse cellular processes, including mitosis progression [55, 56], DNA damage repair [57-59], transcription [60-62], and chromatin remodeling (Figs. 4 and 5) [63, 64].
