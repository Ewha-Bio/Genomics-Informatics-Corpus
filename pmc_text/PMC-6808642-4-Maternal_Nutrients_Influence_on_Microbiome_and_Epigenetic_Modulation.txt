As mentioned above, early environmental factors such as nutrition may have interacted with gut microbiome. Also, the microbial metabolites such as B vitamins, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), polyphenols (ellagic acid, urolithin, equol, isothiocyanate), and omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) are reported to influence epigenetic mechanisms [49,50]. Maternal gut microbe metabolites can change the host cellular levels of important epigenetic modifiers like histone acetyl transferases (HATs), histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and DNA demethylases [51].
A number of the vitamins cannot be synthesized by the human body, therefore must be obtained by the diet. The gut microbiome is one of the important sources of B vitamins for the host [52]. Vitamins B2, B6, B9, and B12 are important cofactors for the enzymes in the folate cycle where the conversion from homocysteine to methionine is required for the availability of SAM. Therefore, these vitamins could affect histone methyl transferasess and DNMTs for histone and DNA methylation. The other gut microbial metabolites such as vitamins B3, B5, and SCFAs are sources of acetyl-CoA or NAD, which affect histone acetylation via sirtuin inhibition or HAT activation [51].
The microbial SCFAs from the fermentation of dietary fiber were shown to maintain the nervous and immune systems through epigenetic modification [17,53]. The SCFA acetate and butyrate are the most abundant in the intestinal tract and can be produced with acetyl-CoA which is universal acetyl group donor for histone acetylation. Maternal acetate suppressed asthma by Treg and Foxp3 through HDAC9 inhibition [54]. Besides, the SCFA butyrate induced global histone acetylation and activation in FOXO3A and MT2 by inhibiting HDAC1 and HDAC2 [55]. The SCFA pentanoate produced by gut microbiota such as Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus affects the use of the acetyl-CoA pool for histone acetylation [56] that inhibits HDAC1 and HDAC8 in CD4+ T cell, thereby reduce interleukin (IL)-17A production and enhance IL-10 production [56].
Polyphenols have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory effects. Maternal supplementation of polyphenols improved the early development of the risk of intrauterine growth restriction [57]. Urolithins are microbial metabolites from ellagic acid (one of the polyphenols) that are reported to have a protective effect on chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome [58] and decrease triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes [14]. Ellagic acid was reported to inhibit reduction of HDAC activity and urolithins prevented HAT activity [15]. Recent studies were shown that urolithin bacteria are Bifidobacterium, pseudocatenulatum, Lactobacilli, and Coriobacteriaceae (Gordonibacter) [59] and Eggerthellaceae family [60]. Equol produced by the intestinal bacterium Lactococcus reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and arterial stiffness [61].
Omega-3 PUFAs are also obtained by the diet and have been interacted with gut microbiota. Maternal omega-3 PUFAs are a key role in the immune system of the infant through the epigenetic mechanism for DNA and histone methylation [11,62]. For the epigenetic mechanism, it was reported that maternal omega-3 PUFA induced changing of methylation level in differentially methylated regions [12] and the promoter methylation level of Interferon γ and IL13 [62]. Maternal omega-3 PUFAs regulated offspring obesity through recomposition of the gut microbiota, Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Clostridia [63]. High- fat diet promotes intestinal epithelial HDAC3 level and SCFA butylate supplementation reduced HDAC3 activity [64]. Similarly, maternal high fat diet decreased fecal SCFA propionate and butylate level and increased Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, Akkermansia, and Verrucomicrobia in the offsprings related to blood pressure [65].
Maternal over-nutrition and undernutrition have shown to increase predisposition to obesity and epigenetic changes in offspring [2,66]. Such maternal malnutrition disrupted the stable microbial community, and less bacterial richness and diversity, which is linked to increased risk of inflammatory diseases and obesity [67-70]. The maternal high fat diet was associated with alterations in the gut microbiome profiles of offspring for Coprococcus, Coriobacteriacae, Helicobacterioceae, and Allobaculum [71], the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes [72] in mice, Campylobacter in Macaca fuscata [13] and Bacteroides in humans [73]. For the epigenetic mechanism, it was reported that the high-fat diet affected HNF4ɑ binding sites at acetylated histone H3K27 in colon epithelium [10] and decreased Bifidobacteriaceae [74]. Similarly, over-weighted woman during pregnancy had higher Bacteroids and lower Phascolarctobacterium than a normal-weighted woman during pregnancy [75]. Under-nutrition group in school-age children had a higher level of the Firmicutes and Lachnospiraceae [76]. Besides, maternal supplementation of probiotics with Lactobacillus rhamnousus or Bifidobacterium lactis induced interferon-gamma production on cord blood compared to controls [77].
