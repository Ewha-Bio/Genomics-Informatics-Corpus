Previously, we developed multiplex qRT-PCR probes that used one specific mRNA marker for each body fluid [16]. In that work, blood was perfectly identified using a single marker, PPBP. However, for other body fluids, such as vaginal secretion and saliva, it was difficult to find out markers that perfectly discriminated them from other body fluids. For example, as saliva and vaginal secretion showed similar expression patterns, many selected body fluid-specific markers were expressed in both body fluids. This problem led us to consider a combination of multiple markers for perfect identification.
A limit in the number of markers that can be assessed in a reaction was the biggest problem when we considered the use of multiple markers for each body fluid. As the number of different fluorescent dyes available in a qRT-PCR reaction is limited (i.e., five), we considered a new method that can measure at least 10 RNAs at once. Fortunately, the recently developed NanoString nCounter allowed us to measure hundreds of probes in a single reaction; so, we adopted the NanoString platform in our body fluid identification project.
Measuring the expression of multiple makers per body fluid has a big advantage. As we have shown, by using two markers for each body fluid, we could identify saliva and vaginal secretions that were not identified perfectly by a single marker. As we could identify blood and semen perfectly using only one marker per body fluid, we conclude that a total of 10 markers is enough to identify four different body fluids in one reaction. In this regard, the NanoString nCounter is a promising platform that allows us to identify each body fluid in one reaction with high accuracy.
