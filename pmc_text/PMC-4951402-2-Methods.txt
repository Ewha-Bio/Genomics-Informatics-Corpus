Study populations
We selected non-osteoporotic participants who were tested via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention of Seoul National University Hospital and the Gangnam Center for Health Promotion. The subjects underwent regular health check-ups from May 2009 to December 2013. Our sample consisted exclusively of Korean men aged between 20 and 60 years. This initial step of the procedure was performed to detect genetic defects associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome [1819]. Those with conditions that could affect body weight were excluded from the study. We also excluded individuals who had taken any medication that might influence BMD, such as bisphosphonate, within the last 3 months or had a history of surgery or foreign body insertion at the spine or femur. After applying the above criteria, 1,192 subjects were selected. After excluding 16 participants who were related to each other, our final sample consisted of 1,176 individuals.
