HP1-mediated transcriptional regulation in response to DDR
Recently, we proposed a mechanism in which HP1 could recover transcription in response to DNA damage signals [60]. HP1 accumulates at the promoter before DNA damage, but BRCA1 is recruited to the promoter after the damage while promoter-resident HP1 is disassembled. Importantly, HP1 assembly is recovered post release from the damage in a BRCA1-HP1 interaction-dependent manner and simultaneously targets SUV39H1 to chromatin. HP1/SUV39H1 restoration at the promoter results in BRCA1 disassembly and histone methylation. In the aftermath, transcriptional repression resumes. This report provides a partial explanation for the targeting of HP1 to a variety of chromatin structures and its functions in constructing de novo heterochromatin from euchromatin or facultative heterochromatin, in addition to maintaining previously existing heterochromatin. In addition, a role in the DDR for HP1, previously implicated in heterochromatin and silencing, reveals new connections between tumor-suppressive processes that maintain genome integrity.
