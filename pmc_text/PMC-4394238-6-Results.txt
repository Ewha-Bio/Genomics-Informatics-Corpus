One of the advantages of a GIS application in the genomic area is that users can easily query and analyze genome-related data. In addition, the users are able to select locations on a genome map and display their records in the attribute table. GIS has a special functionality to support users with simple and complex queries for the data represented in each layer. As shown in Fig. 6, complicated queries were made based on the attributes of genomic data and a given gene location. Fig. 6 presents two query examples: one is for a special gene product (phosphoglucosamine mutase) in the annotated genome of Streptococcus bovis, and another is a query based on a specific accession number belonging to the gene (genes). The results of both query examples are presented on the genome, such that they are highlighted with a red rectangle on the genome layer. ArcGIS allows one to use "Identify tool." Applying this tool allows users to be able to have information about a gene displayed in ArcMap. It has been used as the fastest way to find out the characteristics of a location on a map. On the gene event layer, users are able to identify genes by clicking on a particular location (Fig. 7). This will present the attribute data of the selected location.
The genome ontology of ruminal microbes was developed using OWL/RDF language in the Protégé environment. Fig. 8 shows a screenshot of Protégé's class tab, indicated by a red rectangle. Via this tab, classes, along with their subclasses for the ontology, are displayed in the blue rectangle, and all instances and their attributes are shown in yellow and green rectangles, respectively. Additional tabs for object properties and data type properties are available in the editor, which has the same view as the class tab.
In conclusion, the proposed application provides users with the ability to manage genomic data related to the microbial community of the rumen. This application will be particularly helpful to researchers and experts who are working in fields, such as biology, animal sciences, and genomics. Two central aspects of designing and using such an interactive application are data querying and data sharing. The application allows users (1) to access, visualize, store, query, and analyze the genomic data and (2) to share such data among biology users and applications by providing a semantic structure of data. The data stored in the ontology is machine-processable and can be shared and reused by biology applications.
