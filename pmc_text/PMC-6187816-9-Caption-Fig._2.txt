Combining the 9 Browser Extensible Data (BED) files into an integrated single file: the annotations are contained in nine separate BED files: embryonic stem cells (H1hesc. bed), erythrocytic leukaemia cells (K562.bed), B-lymphoblastoid cells (Gm12878.bed), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hepg2.bed), umbilical vein endothelial cells (Huvec.bed), skeletal muscle myoblasts (Hsmm.bed), normal lung fibroblasts (Nhlf.bed), normal epidermal keratinocytes (Nhlf. bed), and mammary epithelial cells (Hmec.bed) [1, 2].
