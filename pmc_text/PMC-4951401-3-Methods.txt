Protein preparation
As an initial step, the crystal coordinates of AMA1 in complex with a surface-exposed region of RON2 (PDB ID: 2Y8T) was pre-processed using Protein Preparation Wizard of the Schrödinger (New York, NY, USA) suite towards optimizing the stereochemistry by assigning proper bond order, removing steric clashes, adding hydrogen atoms, fixing the disulfide bonds and missing residues and loops. Furthermore, optimization of the protein structure was also performed by adjusting the terminal chi rotation of asparagine, glutamine, and histidine residues. Optimal protonation states for histidine residues were also assigned, followed by the removal of unwanted hetero groups. Finally, energy minimization was performed with OPLS_2005 (Schrödinger) to obtain the optimal geometry.
