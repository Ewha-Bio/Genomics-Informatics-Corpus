Numbers of called functional single nucleotide polymorphisms of human genes according to sequencing depths. (A) Numbers of called coding (blue) and total single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (red) with different sequencing depths: dashed lines are trend lines of means and their error ranges are represented. Solid lines in the inner chart represents how numbers of SNPs are significantly different from each own preceding. (B) The bar chart illustrates the numbers of called silent (blue), nonsense (orange), and missense (red) SNPs. (C) The bar chart illustrates the numbers of called tolerated (blue) and deleterious (red) SNPs in the SIFT database. (B) and (C) represent median values of the ten samples.
