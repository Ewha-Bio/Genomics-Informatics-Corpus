Analysis of the KLF5 SNP
The polymorphisms for the KLF5 (rs3782933) gene were analyzed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/). For each sample, the genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the supplier's instructions. PCR was performed using the Takara DNA Polymerase Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan). All the primers for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing were designed using the Primer3 software (http://Frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3); the sequences are available upon request. PCR reactions were carried out in a final volume of 25 µL containing 10× buffer, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 µmol/L dNTP, 0.5 µmol/L of each primer, 10 ng of genomic DNA as template, and 0.5 U polymerase. Each PCR product was purified and subjected to DNA sequencing by using the QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and the ABI Prism genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) after confirming the purity and mobility of each PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each sample was sequenced for both strands to confirm results.
