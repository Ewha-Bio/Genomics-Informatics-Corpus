Protein-protein interaction networking
Protein cooperates with other proteins to perform accurate functions. To identify protein-protein interactions, STRING was used. STRING is a biological database that is used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for different known and predicted interactions. At present, the database covers up to 5,214,234 proteins from 1,133 organisms [12].
