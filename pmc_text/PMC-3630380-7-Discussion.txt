The rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs are located in the 5' flanking region and the first intron of the IFI6 gene, respectively. These SNPs by themselves are known to regulate gene expression by causing alternative splicing or by changing the binding to a transcription factor or microRNA [21]. The presence of the rs2808426 SNP in the promoter region of IFI6 led us to screen for transcription factors with binding sites near or on rs2808426 (C > T). The binding of several transcription factors, including isoforms of the glucocorticoid receptor Î±, STAT4, v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1), and ETS2, to the protective allele (C) was predicted by ALLGEN PROMO (version 3.0.2; http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3) [27].
Interestingly, the binding of ETS1 to the region containing rs2808426 T was not predicted. Differential binding of ETS1 according to the genotype of rs2808426 may affect the expression of IFI6. IFI6 expression by type I IFNs triggers the formation of IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complexes containing activated STAT1/STAT2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 and their translocation into the nucleus, where they bind to the tandem IFN-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) in the promoter of IFI6 [21, 28-31]. Tandem binding of ISGF3 to the ISRE is required for maximum expression of IFI6 [32], and the promoter region, including rs2808426, enhances IFI6 expression more than the ISRE region alone [21]. The ISGF3-binding site for the ISRE is separated from the ETS1-binding site by about 1.35 kb. The transcription factor ETS1 may regulate the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by protein-protein interaction with STAT1, which is a component of ISGF3 [33]. Overexpression of ETS1 in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line enhances the expression of IFI6 up to 18.4-fold [34]. These data led us to speculate that the interaction between ETS1 and STAT1 in the ISGF3 complex may increase the expression of IFI6.
The present study investigated the association between the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms of the IFI6 gene and the clearance of HBV in the Korean population by multistage comparison between the SR and CLD groups, including the HEP and CIR groups.
In the first stage of the analysis, significant associations between the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphism genotypes and diplotypes were detected. A risk that was associated with the TT genotype in rs2808426 and rs10902662 was detected in the comparison between the SR and the CLD and HEP groups. Strong LD was found between the SNPs rs2808426 and rs10902662, containing most of the promoter region. In addition, diplotype analysis showed that the C-C HT was associated with a higher chance of SR than the T-T/T-T diplotype and that the C-C HT had a protective effect. The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that rs2808426 and rs10902662 may serve as candidate genetic screening markers for HBV clearance or that causative variants that are responsible for HBV clearance may be present in this LD block.
The association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV-induced chronic disease suggest that these polymorphisms might change the expression level of IFI6 according to transcription factor binding. Therefore, an increase in IFI6 expression that is associated with polymorphisms of the gene could inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and block the transmission of the apoptosis signals through Bim in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. HBV-specific CD8+ T cells would thus escape from antigen-induced apoptosis, proliferate, and then differentiate into activated CD8+ T cells to eliminate HBV from the host.
The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that IFI6 polymorphisms play a significant role. In previous studies, CD8+ T cell-related gene polymorphisms, such as those of secreted phosphoprotein 1, interleukin-18, and cyclin D2, were reported to affect the natural course of chronic HBV infections in the Korean population, but the effect of their genetic association is minor (OR, 0.69 to 1.44) [35, 36]. Furthermore, genomewide association studies of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region polymorphisms, including HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQ, demonstrated their association with the chronicity of HBV [37-43]. In our first-stage analysis, the protective effect of the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms was stronger than that reported previously in studies addressing the association with HBV (OR, 6.60). The genotype and diplotype distribution in both groups remained significant after multiple testing by Bonferroni's correction and permutation test. These results might support that genetic variation in IFI6 affects the clearance of HBV.
A second set of samples was used to replicate the results of the first-stage analysis. However, in the second association analysis, the comparison of the SR and the HEP and CIR groups did not yield significant results, even when merging the first- and second-stage samples in a meta-analysis. This could have been due to variation in the sampling cohort, environmental interactions, inadequate statistical power, or gene interactions [1, 44-49]. Furthermore, information on factors important for the progression of liver disease was lacking in the samples analyzed, such as data on alcohol consumption [50].
Although our data could not be reproduced, the results showing an association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV chronicity are significant. Our study is the first study to investigate the association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV clearance as an ISG. In addition, SR patients were used as controls instead of normal healthy subjects to show the effect of genomic background on the chronicity of HBV infection. Normal controls that never contracted HBV are not suitable to show the genetic effects.
Future studies should include a larger sample size and additional information in the replication study to validate the significance of the results through epistasis and environmental interactions. In addition, IFI6 promoter variations should be characterized using next-generation sequencing techniques, causal variants should be identified, and mechanisms underlying the effect of IFI6 on HBV clearance that is mediated by HBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell survival need to be investigated.
In the present study, an initial discovery stage showed that the rs2808426 and rs10902662 genotypes and the corresponding diplotype were associated with a higher probability of HBV clearance in a Korean population. However, the results could not be replicated in a second stage with a different patient sample. Further studies should be aimed at showing how IFI6 affects HBV clearance by promoting HBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cell survival. Moreover, identification of causal variants in the IFI6 by including a large number of samples may help clarify the role of IFI6 on HBV clearance.
