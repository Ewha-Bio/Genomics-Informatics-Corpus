Effect of the interaction between polymorphisms located in the LPL gene and lifestyle on lipid concentration
We tested LPL SNPs and HTs from stage 1. All significant associations were found in the results of the dominant model for the minor allele. The association of minor alleles for 3 SNPs (rs263, rs271, rs328) with higher HDLC levels also depended on energy intake (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of these, the minor alleles of 2 SNPs (rs263, rs271) were associated with lower TG levels, also depending on energy intake. The association of the minor alleles of two SNPs (rs263, rs271) with higher HDLC levels also depended on fat intake (Fig. 1). The minor alleles of 2 SNPs (rs263, rs271) were also associated with higher HDLC levels and lower TG levels through an interaction with cigarette smoking and with lower TG levels through an interaction with alcohol consumption (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 4). Interaction effects of HT1 and 2 in block 1, which were formed by two SNP (rs271, rs263) in strong LD (r2 = 0.99), with lifestyle factors on HDLC and TG levels were found to be almost same with those of rs271 and rs263 (data not shown). In block 2, HT3 was associated with higher HDLC levels and lower TG levels and depended on an interaction with energy intake (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). HT4 in block 2 was associated with lower TG levels through an interaction with cigarette smoking (Supplementary Fig. 4). For the interaction between LPL polymorphisms and physical activity, there was no significant association with any lipid levels.
