Chromosomal microarray
CMA tests were performed with Affymetrix CytoScan 750K arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a GeneChip GCS3000dx V2 scanner (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The array had 750,436 markers (550,000 non-polymorphic markers and 200,436 single nucleotide polymorphism markers), based on genome build hg19. The results were analyzed with Chromosome Analysis Suite ver. 3.2.0.1252 (Affymetrix).
