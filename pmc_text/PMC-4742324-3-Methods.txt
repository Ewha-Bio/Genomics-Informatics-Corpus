Detection of selective sweep
To detect selective sweep, we implemented two between-populations methods (XPEHH and XPCLR) between each pairwise breed contrast. These statistics used the phased data based on the SNP genotypes obtained from the wholegenome resequencing. For each contrast, XPEHH and XPCLR were implemented across all SNPs between the three pig breeds to identify potential positive selection. We used a p-value of <0.01 for XPEHH and the top 1,000 genes in XPCLR as the cutoff criteria. These tests revealed that some SNPs might have been under positive selection in the Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc breeds, respectively.
