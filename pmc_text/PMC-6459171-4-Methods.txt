Microarray data analysis
Scanned images were analyzed with Affymetrix microarray analysis suite 6.0 gene expression software. The gene list was selected based on the signal intensity of >700 arbitrary units and consistency of the signal intensity across the four chips. The signal intensity was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) levels. Functional organization of the transcriptome was established using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) bioinformatics [28]. Affymetrix identifiers (ID) of transcription factors were analyzed in the functional annotation tool of the DAVID 6.8 website (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov). The software generated annotated chart with biological terms and p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg corrected for false discovery rate) associated with the transcriptional factors. Selected examples were shown. Expression profiling of a variety of mouse tissues has been described previously [29]. Tissue-specific gene expression dataset from multiple mouse tissues was downloaded from the website (http://www.biogps.org). Mouse lung type II data were normalized to 4 Gapdh levels and resulting data were analyzed by linkage across arrays and genes by using CLUSTER software [30].
Transcription factor interactions were visualized using protein-protein interactions databases (https://openwetware.org/wiki). Microarray datasets for mouse developmental stage E12.5 and adult CDH+, CDH–; EpCAM+, EpCAM– Sox9+ lung stem cells as well as in vitro differentiated E12.5 stage Sox9+ cells at passage 2 and 10 (P2, P10) were previously reported [22]. Mouse lung developmental gene expression dataset was downloaded from Jackson Lab website (http://www.jax.org) and analyzed using software from the website (http://www.heatmapper.ca).
