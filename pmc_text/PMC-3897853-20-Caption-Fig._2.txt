Migration and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and MMP9 activities increased in H460R cells. (A) Comparison of colony morphology between H460 and H460R cells. (B, C) Wound healing assay. (D) Zymography (upper) and expression of representative proteins (lower) related to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition between H460 and H460R cells. **p < 0.01 vs. H460 (n = 3).
