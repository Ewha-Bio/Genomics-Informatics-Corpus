Web-based bioinformatics tool
A platform to simply search and estimate statistical significance of molecules across various cancer types accessible to investigators without bioinformatics or statistics expertise are available at the KCGD website (Fig. 1). It supports dataset search, in which a user explores cancer genomics or epigenomics datasets in Korean stored in the database, and gene search, which determines statistical difference between cancer known subtypes or prognostic value of a molecule in which users are interested.
When accessing the gene search module, a number of accession identifiers including gene symbol, RefSeq (NM_* or XM_*), Entrez and protein accession number (NP_* or XP_*) can be selected, then the user input keyword(s) for search and click the search button. Although the search criteria were arranged using small number of identifiers, most known molecule identifiers were incorporated in the database by full text indexing method, indicating any molecule identifiers were allowed to search by clicking "anything..." category. Clicking the search button, the measurement data of expression or methylation are sought by the keyword and matched list with molecule information and thumb nail image of measurement intensities across cancers are displayed. Next, by clicking a thumb nail image, the system try to estimate the significance of a molecule using the log-rank test with Kaplan-Meier curves and display bar plots to illustrate the landscape of intensities among patients and box plots with a p-value obtained from a two sample t test or ANOVA test (Fig. 1). With p-values by log-rank test or significance test with t test or ANOVA, the prognostic value of a molecule or its difference between cancer subtypes may be determined, respectively. The entire analysis procedures of the system were described in Supplementary Fig. 2.
