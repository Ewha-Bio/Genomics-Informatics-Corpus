IA is a kind of illness in which the occurrence increases along with the development of IT technology. Although it is urgent to have an analysis database of IA, it is not sufficient now. Because the database needed to analyze medical information handles very sensitive personal data, security is very important. Our study proposed the IABio platform service using OAuth in a medical information standardbased environment. The proposed IABio uses IUA as a medical standard guideline and complies with medical information standards. Also, it uses OAuth 2.0, which is an access control technology. To realize IABio, it is necessary to analyze the complicated requirements of a medical information system and to design the system from the perspective of security. In addition, our study developed a prototype IABio system and tested if it could be applied with a security system. As a result, it was found that each user had a different environment in which the researcher needed to access a database. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed IABio can be actively used for studies of IA.
As follow-up research, solutions to phishing scams and re-use attack, to which OAuth 2.0 is vulnerable, will be examined. Also, an index searching method will be studied to quickly search genome information related to IA.
