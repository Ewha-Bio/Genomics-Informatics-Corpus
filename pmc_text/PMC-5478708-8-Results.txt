NS-398 versus DMSO
The analysis of NS-398 versus DMSO showed that two gene sets are enriched in NS-398–treated HDFs as compared with DMSO-treated HDFs. These gene sets consist of genes regulating the tumor necrosis factor beta receptor (TNFR2) pathway and the fructose and mannose metabolism (Table 2, Fig. 2A). Enriched genes in each pathway were shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.
On the other hand, four gene sets were enriched in DMSO-treated HDFs as compared with NS-398–treated HDFs: genes down-regulated in response to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and genes regulating the protein secretion, the trefoil factor pathway and the receptor-regulated Smads (R-SMAD) binding (Table 3, Fig. 2B). Enriched genes in each gene set were shown in Supplementary Tables 3, 4, 5, 6.
