Preprocessing for data structure modeling of graph database: (1) data set download using CSV or TSV format; (2) standardized representation of each node: gene, protein, disease, etc; (3) integration of node-node (e.g., gene-protein, gene-disease, drug-disease, etc.) associations from multiple data sources; and (4) filtering of unconnected and redundant entities. The final graph database contains 114,550 nodes and 82,674,321 relationships.
