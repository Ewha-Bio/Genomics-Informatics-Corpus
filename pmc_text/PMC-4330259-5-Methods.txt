Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). Most statistical analyses were performed using PLINK and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The ABCG2 gene SNP rs2725220 was selected using the Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP Array 5.0.
Each SNP was tested for possible effects on uric acid levels under an additive model. The multivariate linear regression models used in the study incorporated covariates (age and sex). Multiple logistic regression analysis was also performed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to examine the association of the ABCG2 SNP with abnormal uric acid levels (≥7 mg/dL for men and ≥6 mg/dL for women). All statistical tests were two-sided, and the statistical significance was determined as p < 0.05.
