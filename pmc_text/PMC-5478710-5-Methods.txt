Multiple genome alignments
In this study, Gegenees software (version 2.2.1) was used for multiple-genome alignments. The software is written in JAVA, and making it compatible with several platforms. Limitations were not observed in the speed calculation, number and memory of the genomes that could be aligned. Gegenees software is also capable of performing fragmented alignments [4]. Multiple alignments of E. coli genomes were created using a fragment size of 200 nucleotides, a step size of 100 parameters, and BLASTN, which was optimized for highly similar sequences.
