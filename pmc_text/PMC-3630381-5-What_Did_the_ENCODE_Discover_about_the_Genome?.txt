Transcription factors
Transcription factors can bind to DNA and alter the expression of genes [23]. The ENCODE Consortium has detected 45 million different events where transcription factors occupy DNA across 41 diverse cell types [16]. For this, high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology was applied to create occupancy maps for binding sites for a variety of DNA binding factors [5]. The architecture of the network of human transcription factors was found to be quite complex [24].
