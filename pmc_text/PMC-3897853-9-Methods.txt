Wound healing assay
Cells were seeded on a 24-well plate, and a wound was generated using a 200-ÂµL tip; medium containing 10% FBS was added. Wound healing was observed under a microscope after 0, 16, 24, and 48 h. Images were captured and analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
