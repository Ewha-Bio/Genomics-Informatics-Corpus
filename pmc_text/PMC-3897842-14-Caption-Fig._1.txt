On the road to cancer: genomic instability. Failure of DNA damage responses that conduct surveillance and checkpoints to guard genome causes genomic instability, the most common characteristic of human cancers. It has therefore been proposed that genomic instability contributes to and drives tumor initiation and development. Defects in the DNA damage responses generate genomic instability and facilitate tumorigenesis.
