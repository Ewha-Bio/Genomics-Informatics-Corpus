MS Analysis
After sample processing, the extracted peptides are subjected to MS analysis. A mass spectrometer consists of an ionization source, a mass analyzer separating the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and a detector recording the number of ions at each m/z value. Two commonly used types of ionization are electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). While each approach has its own advantages, MALDI is more tolerant to the presence of salts. Thus, MALDI is often applied to direct tissue profiling or molecular ion imaging from tissue sections. Direct tissue sample analysis by MALDI-based MS is usually performed by a simple sequence of steps, which include placing the tissue of interest on the MALDI plate, applying a droplet of matrix, and irradiating the co-crystallized tissue to cause desorption/ionization of the peptides [30]. MALDI imaging provides valuable information pertaining to the spatial localization of neuropeptides [40]. Although MALDI-MS can be interfaced with separation strategies, such as liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis, ESI-MS can be coupled more easily with the separation methods, because the ions are produced as an aerosol from the liquid phase with a high voltage in ESI. The introduction of a nano-electrospray, based on capillary LC, coupled to MS, significantly increases the sensitivity in LC-ESI-MS, and furthermore, the preferred formation of multiple-charge states in ESI allows for more comprehensive MS/MS fragmentation data.
