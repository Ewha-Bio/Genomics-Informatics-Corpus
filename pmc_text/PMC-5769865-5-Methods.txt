Measurement of classifier’s performance
When the predictor was focused on the problem of distinguishing proteins containing a certain type of metal ion from proteins that do not contain any type of metal, it is important that both sets contain the same number of proteins; otherwise, several figures of merit that are commonly used to monitor the prediction reliability would be seriously biased. The reliability of the predictions was monitored with the following quantities. If a protein of type 1 must be distinguished from a protein of type 2, a prediction was considered to be a true-positive if type 1 was correctly predicted; it was considered to be a true-negative if type 2 was correctly predicted; it was considered to be a false-negative if a type 1 protein was predicted to be a type 2 protein; and it was considered to be a false-positive if a type 2 protein was predicted to be a type 1 protein. Consequently, the following figures of merit, the sensitivity, the specificity, the accuracy, the Mathews correlation are computed [41] as shown in the Eq. (1) below.
