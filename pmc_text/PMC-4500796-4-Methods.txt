Annotation of genetic variants
We annotated variants using diverse tools and databases. The region information of variants (such as coding or intron regions and splice sites) was annotated using SnpEff [20]. Further, we predicted the functional effects of variations on genes (such as silent, nonsense, or missense SNPs) using SnpEff [20]. We also predicted whether an amino acid substitution significantly affects protein function (such as deleterious or tolerated SNPs) using SIFT [21]. In addition, we checked previously known SNPs using the dbSNP database [22]. We also checked clinical SNPs using the ClinVar database [23].
