Linkage disequilibrium (LD) means non-random association of alleles between different loci in a population [1]. Genetic variants in close proximity tend to be inherited together as a single haplotype and low frequency of recombination between them resulting in association between alleles of these variants in the population data [12]. Therefore, information of LD can provide evidences to support a hypothesis about population history and help to reveal genetic etiology [34]. Many researchers have studied the structure of LD patterns by observing population data and have found that one of the most obvious characteristics of the structure of LD is that the human genome can be divided into non-overlapping block partitions in which only a small number of haplotypes are observed [5]. These blocks are called haplotype blocks or LD blocks [678910]. The variants within a same block tend to be in strong LD with each other whereas the variants across different blocks are mostly in weak LD or in linkage equilibrium [8].
The location and distribution of haplotype blocks can be seen as a population characteristic that is influenced by evolutionary phenomenon such as selection, mutation rate, recombination rate and population structure [11]. Especially, strong agreement between recombination hotspots and the haplotype block boundaries has been reported through comparisons of the block locations with the experimentally obtained locations of recombination hotpots [6]. In the other hand, an investigation on haplotype blocks using simulated data revealed that haplotype blocks can be formed without recombination hotspots [9]. However, their investigation in [9] used an operational definition for haplotype block in which all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are in strong LD with each other resulting in producing many short length blocks.
Several different methods for haplotype block partitioning have been developed and implemented in distributable software. Among them, Haploview carries three different methods for haplotype block partitioning each of which adopts a different operational definition for haplotype blocks: confidence interval (CI) method by Gabriel et al. [8], four gamete test (FGT) by Wang et al. [9], and solid spine (SS) method [10]. More recently, following the haplotype block definition of Gabriel et al. [8], some computationally efficient algorithms have been also released and these include MIG++ [12] and S-MIG++ [13]. MIG++ is also implemented in PLINK 1.9 with additional modification for computational efficiency [14].
Haplotype blocks can be directly obtained from the individual genetic association study data of SNP markers. Also, in many cases, they are identified using reference panel data such as HapMap or 1000 Genomes Project. These databases or study-specific data have different SNP marker sets with different density. If haplotype blocks are related to the biological causes such as recombination hotspots or population history, the location of blocks- the block boundaries—should be marker—independent and the most accurate estimation of haplotype block locations should be obtained from DNA sequencing data where every polymorphism is identified in the data. Therefore, to apply the haplotype block information obtained from the genotype data of a subset of polymorphisms in that region to the population genetic research or discovery of disease susceptibility variants, the effects of marker density on the haplotype block partition results should be carefully considered.
In this paper, we describe how the density of SNP markers affects haplotype blocks partitions by comparing the block partition results obtained from the experimental datasets sampled from the reference panel using several certain sampling ratio conditions. We also investigate how these effects of the marker density work differently for different haplotype block partitioning methods. The haplotype block partition methods we investigate include three methods implemented in Haploview (CI, FGT, and SS) [10], MIG++ implemented in PLINK version 1.9 [1214], and S-MIG++ [13]. For reference panel to construct experimental datasets we use the 1000 Genomes Projects phase 1 release 3 dataset [15] and HapMap phase III dataset [16]. From our investigation, we found that low sampling ratio under 50% cannot guarantee marker-independent haplotype partition results for all methods and the haplotype blocks constructed from full density data tend to be divided into small length blocks compared to the results from low density data.
