Step 2. Combining SNP data
In this step, we combine the SNP data of the two panels. First, we select overlapping SNPs that exist in both panels. An alternative approach would be to keep all SNPs as partially missing data. However, in this alternative approach, the missing values in this step will be automatically imputed in step 4 and will be used as reference data in the imputation. Because using imputed data as reference data can degrade the performance, we avoided this alternative approach. Second, we check and correct the strand flips of the SNPs between the two panels. For A/T and G/C SNPs with strand flips that are difficult to detect, we use frequency information.
