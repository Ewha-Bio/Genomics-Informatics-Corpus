Study subjects and genotypes
The subjects and their genotypes in the original study have been reported [7]. The initial subjects were obtained from a subset of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study cohort (KoGES), known as Korean Association Resource (KARE, n = 8,842) [7]. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and this project was approved by the institutional review board at Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH).
