Filtering out highly variable 200-bp units
After integrating the BED files, we defined the variability count of the chromatin states of a given 200-bp unit as the number of states where counts of occurrences were non-zeroes, to define and compare the observed consistency of each chromatin state at any given genomic position across all 9 epigenomes. For example, the chromatin state variability count of the chr1: 12,800–13,000 block in Fig. 2 would be four, as there are four non-zero states (i.e., 7, 9, 10, and 11), whereas the chromatin state variability count of the chr1: 10,200–10,400 block in Fig. 2 would be one, as there is only one non-zero state.
We could then use variability count statistics and maximum likelihood decision rule to create an optimal classification Markov model, as uniform priors can be assumed if 200-bp units with stable chromatin state are used. In this way, the highly variable 200-bp units, with which different chromatin states were frequently switched to other states across different tissues and cell types, could be eliminated in the training Markov transition tables. Our rationale behind this was that, compared to the highly variable 200-bp units, the 200-bp units that are less frequently changed would show a strong Markov property.
When the human genome was dissected into a 200-bp unit, there were originally 14,148,124 units (see Table 1). Among these units, all of the variability counts of the chromatin states of 5,721,116 units were one, indicating that all 9 cell lines were annotated with the same state in these 200-bp units, and the variability counts of the chromatin states of 4,557,108 units were two. It also indicates that all of the 9 cell lines were annotated as either of the two states in these 200-bp units.
This means that most of these 200-bp units have strong preferences for certain dominant chromatin state, where a dominant state of a 200-bp unit is the most frequently annotated chromatin state among the 15 chromatin states. This provided good heuristic insight for designing new Markov models for our study. Thus, it was possible to assign only one or two dominant chromatin states for most of the 200-bp units of the entire human genome.
