Nimbolide shows an important role in cancer prevention via inhibition of cell survival, cell cycle progression, invasion, migration and induction of apoptosis. The diverse molecular targets influenced by nimbolide include the growth factors and their receptor, signaling molecules, transcription factors, protein kinases, enzymes and genes regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Red down arrow indicates that these molecules are down-regulated by nimbolide, whereas, green up arrow indicate that these molecules are up-regulated by nimbolide.
