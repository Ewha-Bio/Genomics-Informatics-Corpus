Heterochromatin protein 1
HP1 was originally identified in Drosophila, functioning in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Three different paralogs of HP1 are found in Drosophila melanogaster: HP1a, HP1b, and HP1c. Subsequently, orthologs of HP1 were also discovered in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Swi6), xenopus (Xhp1α and Xhp1γ), chicken (CHCB1, CHCB2, and CHCB3), and mammals (HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ) (Fig. 4) [33, 34]. HP1 binds directly to the methylated K9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9me), a surrogate marker for transcriptionally repressive heterochromatin, and is critical for its maintenance [35-37]. Therefore, its canonical functions include maintaining heterochromatin integrity as a fundamental unit of heterochromatin, silencing by heterochromatin formation, and gene repression by heterochromatization of euchromatin. HP1 proteins are characterized by two conserved domains: the chromodomain (CD) in its N-terminus and the chromo shadow domain (CSD) in the C-terminus (Fig. 4). The CD has been shown to directly bind H3K9me, while the CSD is implicated in interacting with a partner protein and its homo- and hetero-dimerization. Two CD and CSD domains are separated by a hinge domain that is involved in DNA and RNA binding (Figs. 4 and 5) [38, 39]. HP1 interacts with numerous epigenomic modifiers with different cellular functions in different organisms (Fig. 5). Some of these HP1-interacting partners are histone methyltransferse, DNMT, and methyl CpG-binding protein MeCP2 (Fig. 5), supporting its role in epigenomic modification.
