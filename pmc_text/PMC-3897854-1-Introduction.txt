Various forms of epilepsy are among the most common serious brain disorders and present through convulsion, autonomic movement, impaired consciousness, and more [1]. These neurological disorders affect an estimated 42 million people of all ages worldwide [2]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) has challenged the treatment of epilepsy, since many antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are not effectively distributed to the vascular endothelium or, accordingly, to their targets in brain [3, 4]. The BBB, thought to be the first-line barrier to the disposition of drug from the blood to the brain [5], consists of the interplay of three major microvascular components. Tight junctions between the endothelial cells constitute the major permeability barrier. The overall biology of the barrier is shaped by the interactions between the endothelium and the pericytes/smooth muscle cells and the astrocyte foot processes that cover most of the abluminal surface of the microvasculature [6].
Drug pharmacokinetics is controlled by drug transporters, which regulate drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. Drug transporters are considered a second-line barrier for limiting drug disposition from the blood to the brain [7]. In brain capillary endothelial cells, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1); multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), MRP2, MRP4, and MRP5; and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are among the many drug transporters that might be expressed at the luminal side of the membrane [5, 8, 9]. MRP2, in particular, is over-expressed (about 225% greater) in drug-refractory temporal lobe epileptic patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) [5, 10-12]. Drug reactions can be different between individuals with the same AED blood concentrations and therapeutic levels, because drug distribution is influenced by variable levels of drug transporters. MRP2 is thought to play a more important role in the distribution of AEDs than other transporters in the epileptic brain [13]. MRP2 has been demonstrated to transport many AEDs, including valproate (VPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), and more [9, 14-17]. Valproic acid has become established as one of the most widely used AEDs in the treatment of both generalized and partial seizures in adults and children and is considered to be a substrate of MRP2 [9, 14-17]. Probenecid, an inhibitor of MRPs, has been shown to increase the concentration of valproic acid in the brain [18]. In animal models, TR- rats (MRP2 knockout) have lower VPA and VPA-glucuronide in their bile than control Wistar rats (which intrinsically express MRP2) [19].
Functional polymorphisms in genes encoding drug transporters can alter AED uptake, cerebral distribution, and efflux, resulting in individual differences in AED concentration and effectiveness and/or the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Many functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported. For example, mRNA expression of the c.1446CG MRP2 genotype was recently revealed to be higher than the c.1446CC genotype in the liver [20]. In addition, the c.2302C > T (exon 18, Arg768Trp) mutation is responsible for Dubin-Johnson syndrome [21, 22]. The c.2302C > T and c.4348G > A genotypes correlate with significantly lower MRP2 protein expression levels compared to wild-type and V417I [21]. The c.1249G > A mutation significantly reduces the amount of MRP2 mRNA in human preterm placentas [23]. The g.-1774delG polymorphism has been linked with toxic hepatitis by our group [24]. In the present study, we investigated the association between the g.-1774delG MRP2 genotype and ADRs of the central nervous system (CNS) in VPA treatment groups.
