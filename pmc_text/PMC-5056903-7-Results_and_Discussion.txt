Docking analysis of H1N1 NA with natural ligands
Few earlier in silico docking studies conducted against NA protein with zanamivir, oseltamivir and some natural ligands to recommend NA as a suitable drug target as well as the importance of natural inhibitors [3233]. In this study, we have predicted the structure of NA for docking analysis and found that all natural ligands (inhibitors) were docked in various conformations and with varying binding energies, the lowest energy conformation was selected. Upon docking, the high-ranked binding energies of modeled structures of NA (Table 2) proteins with natural ligands were obtained. All the 13 active natural compounds were found to interact with the receptor at the sialic acid site (Fig. 3A–M). In our docking study, among the 13 different ligands, theaflavin showed the lowest binding energy (–5.21 kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (150.69 µM) for the protein (H1N1 NA)-ligand complex. Theaflavin was found to interact with the amino acid residues like Arg118, Asp151, Asp 152, Arg193, Asp199, Asn344, and Arg430 of NA by forming hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A). Theaflavin and catechins are two active polyphenolic compounds found in green tea and reported to have pronounced antiviral activity [718]. Due to its ability to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immunity, green tea is very useful for preventing influenza by inhibiting flu replication. Further, ursolic acid showed the second lowest binding energy of –4.97 kcal/mol and an inhibition constant of 228.26 µM. During docking with the receptor it formed two hydrogen bond with Asn146 and Lys150 of NA (Fig. 3B). Ursolic acid is the active component of O. sanctum (tulsi) which has great ayurvedic treatment option for swine flu and due to its antimicrobial properties it useful for the prevention of novel H1N1 flu [17]. The principal components of the oil of M. piperita are menthol (29%), menthone (20% to 30%), and menthyl acetate (3% to 10%). Menthol has antimicrobial and antiviral activity and also observed to have virucidal against influenza, herpes, and other viruses in vitro [11]. In our docking study, the interaction binding energy of menthol and NA was observed to be –4.89 kcal/mol with inhibition constant of 259.37 µM. Further, it formed four hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues (Ile436, Ile149, Thr148, and Gly147) of NA (Fig. 3C).
Further, other natural compounds like curcumin, reported to have strong antioxidant with anti-inflammatory, anti-viral properties [15]; carvacrol, the active constituent of the essential oil from the fruit of Trachyspermum ammi [8] which is used for the treatment of colds, coughs, influenza, and asthma [10]; allicin (active compounds present in ginger) has been reported to have anti-influenza cytokine [13]; ajoene present in garlic and the garlic has been used for hundreds of years to treat fungal, parasitic, and viral infections, and has anti-inflammatory properties and it is reported to kill influenza virus in vitro [14]. Further, curcumin, tinosporon, eugenol, catechin, baicalin, and andrographolide were also found to inhibit H1N1 NA with significant binding energy of in the range of –4.89 to –4.0 kcal/mol (Table 2). The current in silico docking study, also observed all these natural ligands inhibits H1N1 NA with significant binding energy (Table 2).
All natural ligands were reported to block influenza infection; our docking study also revealed the in silico validation for the possible mechanism of blocking. Most of the natural ligands were found to interact with H1N1 NA protein with effective binding energy and with amino acid residues known for sialic acid binding. This interaction might prevent NA glycoprotein from interacting with host sialic acid, which may correlate with why these natural compounds are used to prevent or treat against influenza without any adverse effect.

In conclusion, different natural/herbal products with antiviral activity have been traditionally used to prevent or reduce the effects of the viral infection. Most of literature has given stress on using natural products of plant origin. It is the time for in silico validation of those plant products against viral proteins before in vitro and in vivo study. The major antigenic determinants of H1N1 virus is NA which is a surface glycoprotein and is a suitable target for H1N1. Thus, in order to prevent or cure viral infection, there is need to identify new inhibitors against NA. The in silico docking approaches used in this study revealed the molecular interaction of natural ligands against NA protein which may be of interest in designing new drugs from natural sources against H1N1. Out of all the inhibitors molecules, Theaflavin has been docked with minimum binding energy of –5.21 kcal/mol by forming hydrogen bonding with amino acid residue of the receptor can be consider for in vitro and in vivo validation.
