Regulatory chromatin marks
Regulatory signals, such as DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs), CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites, transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and other regulatory chromatin marks including H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 were downloaded from the ENCODE browser (https://www.encodeproject.org), with the search limited to ENCODE Tier-1 cell lines, including GM12878, H1-hESC, and K562 cells. The site information about all these regulatory signals was mapped onto the intron sequences and the 2-kb upstream sequences, as described above.
