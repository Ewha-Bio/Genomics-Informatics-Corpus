Analysis of radioresistant H460R cells under physiologically normal conditions. (A) Morphology changes and increased vacuoles in H460R cells. Arrow points to a vesicular organelle (left). Flow cytometry after acridine orange staining (right). (B) MTT activity. (C) Cell cycle and (D) reactive oxygen species levels between H460 and H460R cells from flow cytometric analysis. Not significant (ns); p > 0.05 vs. H460 (n = 3). MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
