CTCF and transcription factor binding sites are overlapped with CpGIs and TSSs
GTEx RNA-seq strategy indicates that HOTAIR has variable expression in different tissues and its most expression level is in the artery-tibial tissue (data not shown). We found two putative regions for CTCF binding sites in the HOTAIR locus by ENCODE with factorbook motifs, one of which is located within CpG1437 (bona fide CpGIs) and mostly overlaps with CpG165 (Table 2, Fig. 3). This track determines regions of transcription factor binding sites taken from a comprehensive chip-seq experiments identified by ENCODE and factorbook pool (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). We predicted sequences of motifs and positions of these motifs in the HOTAIR locus by using MEME and MAST programs (Supplementary Table 3). MEME program searches the motifs from downloaded sequences through using complementary strengths of probabilistic and discrete models (http://MEME-Suite.org/) [35, 36]. The program was run with default parameters and normal mode of motif discovery. Mast program searches specific sequences based on predicted motifs by MEME program and exactly matches these sequences with the motifs sequences (http://MEME-Suite.org/) [37].
We found nine sequences of modules depending on their transcription factor binding sites in the HOTAIR locus by PReMode program [38, 39]. We observed some of these elements overlapped with the predicted CpGIs and TSSs (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). In addition, we determined that some of these modules have common transcription factors (data not shown).
