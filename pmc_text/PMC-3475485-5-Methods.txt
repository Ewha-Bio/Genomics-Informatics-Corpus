Clustering algorithm
The normalized log ratio corresponding to each time point was exported to the software for clustering algorithm. Acuity version 3.1 (Molecular Devices) was used for the 'gene shaving' algorithm. To estimate the number of clusters in a dataset, the 'Gap Statistics' attribute of the Acuity software package was used. The cluster number, estimated by gap statistics, was used for an input parameter in gene shaving. After gene shaving, a single linkage was used for hierarchical clustering.
