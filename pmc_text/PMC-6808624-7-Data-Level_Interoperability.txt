At the data level, we investigate to which degree information is preserved or lost when converting data from one format to another or when mapping data from one schema to another. By “annotation model” (short: model), we refer to the basic building blocks (e.g., spans, relations, attributes) which are largely independent of the domain in which the annotation takes place. By “annotation schema,” we refer to domain-specific categories ranging from linguistic categories such as part-of-speech, named entities, and dependency relations, to domain-specific categories such as proteins or habitats.Table 1 shows a point-by-point comparison of the annotation formats of the three platforms. Fig. 1 shows a coreference annotation example represented in the original formats of the three platforms, illustrating their difference.
