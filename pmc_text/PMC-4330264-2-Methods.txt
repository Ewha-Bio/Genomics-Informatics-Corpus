Computational analysis
We used miRNAs annotated as small non-coding RNA genes defined by the GENCODE database, v.19 (http://www.gencodegenes.org) [21]. RepeatMasker outputs (hg19 assembly, RM v.330, repbase libraries 20120124) were obtained from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/, hg19). To analyze the intersection between miRNA and REs, we used the intersectBed command (with options -wa and -wb) in BEDTools [22].
