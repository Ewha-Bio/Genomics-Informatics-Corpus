Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses
Quantified RNA samples were used for miR-21-3p expression and its target gene; HOXC9 3´ UTR expression analysis. HB miR Multi Assay Kit System I (Heim Biotek, Seongnam, Korea) was used to miRNA analysis that miR-21-3p reverse transcription (RT) and real-time PCR. First, 500 ng RNA reaction volume per each tissue need to 11 μL containing RNase free water. Then for synthesis of cDNA—HB_I RT Reaction Kit and its reagents was used in compliance with manufacturer’s instructions and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification was performed in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) on terms of 37℃ for 60 min followed by incubation at 95℃ for 5 min for one cycle and then held at 4℃. Synthesized cDNA samples in various tissues olive flounder were stored at ‒20℃. Second, HB_I Real-time PCR Master Mix Kit from the HB miR Multi Assay Kit System I was followed by manufacturer’s protocols. All cDNA samples were amplified in triplicate to ensure reproducibility with a Rotor-Gene Q system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time PCR was initial denaturation for 15 min at 95℃, 45 thermal cycles of 95℃ for 10 s and 60℃ for 40 s and standard melting conditions of ramp ranging from 55℃ to 99℃ with 1℃ rise on each step. As a standard control, miRNA U6 was used as reference. Relative expression ratio of the target miR-21-3p (5’-CGACAACAGUCUGAAGGCUGUC-3’) to miRNA U6 were analyzed the comparative threshold method (2-ΔΔ Ct).
In case of target gene expression analysis, 7 μL of ddH2O, 10 μL of QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), 1 μL of each forward (5´-TCGTGCA-TCTACCTCGACAG-3´) and reverse (5´-CCTCCTCCT-CCTTGGTTTTC-3´) primers and 1 μL of cDNA template. Real-time RT-PCR amplification for target gene and housekeeping gene were carried out 45 cycles of 94℃ for 10 s, 60℃ for 15 s, and 72℃ for 15 s. Melting curve was progressed for 30 s at 55‒99℃. All samples were amplified in triplicate and housekeeping gene was used universal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) of sense primer (5´-GAAATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGG-3´) and antisense primer (5´-GAGCCCCAGCCTTCTCCATG-3´). For statistical analysis, the expression data were measured as the mean ± standard deviation. Significant differences among various tissue samples were determined by the unpaired Student’s t test. The value of p ＜ 0.05 was accepted as an indication of statistical significance. Differences less than p ＜ 0.05 were considered.
