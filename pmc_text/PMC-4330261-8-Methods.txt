RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Mutant or wild-type HNF1B was overexpressed in the mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare cDNA, 6 µL of reaction buffer (Invitrogen), 3 µL of 100 mM DTT, 1.5 µL of 10 mM dNTP, 0.6 µL of random primer, 0.3 µL of RNase inhibitor, 1.0 µL of RTase, and 1 µg of RNA were mixed, and RNase-free water was added up to 30 µL. The mixture was incubated 37℃ for 1 h and 72℃ for 10 min using a PCR system. Expression levels of genes were determined by using SYBR Master Mix (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and an AB 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The primer sequences for the PCR were as follows: 5'-GGC TAA TTT CAG GAC TGG TT-3' and 5'-TTT CTT TGC CCT GAC TTC CT-3' for GLUT2 and 5'-CTC GGC TCA CCG TTT CCT T-3' and 5'-CGC GCT TGC TAA TAG TGC AG-3' for INS. Samples were prepared repetitively, and each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Expression levels of each gene were measured relative to 18S and normalized to the expression levels in total RNA with the ΔΔCT method.
