More specifically, this study adopts the functionality of linear referencing (LR) for representing genome-annotated data in a GIS environment. Our application uses ontology to semantically organize and reason the data in a semantic and machine-understandable framework. In this application, we defined a measurement unit for genomes, so that one meter was assigned per nucleotide. The users have the flexibility to interact with the genome as a layer or with different genomes as a collection of layers. The ArcGIS platform of the application supports users with interactive genomic maps and implementation of special queries.
