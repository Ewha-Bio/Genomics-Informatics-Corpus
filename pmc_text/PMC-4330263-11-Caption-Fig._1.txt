The histogram of genetic value variances of G-BLUP (A), SNP-BLUP (B), and SNP-GBLUP (C). The shapes of the histograms of G-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP were nearly identical. However, the shape of the histogram of SNP-BLUP was disparate from the other two BLUPs. G-BLUP, genomic relationship matrix-based best linear unbiased prediction; SNP-BLUP, single nuleotide polymorphism (SNP)-best linear unbiased predictor; SNP-GBLUP, SNP-genomic linear unbiased prediction.
