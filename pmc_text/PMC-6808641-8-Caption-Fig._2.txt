Scatter plots of gene expression values of the four pairs of samples produced using the HiSeq 4000 and MGISEQ-2000 sequencers. Gene expression values are represented as the base 2 logarithm of counts per million (cpm). The Pearson correlation coefficients of the four samples were between 0.98 and 0.99.
