Data analysis
Frequency of minor allele frequency (MAF), distribution, and deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were estimated using Golden Helix SNP Variation Suite version 7 (Golden Helix, Inc.). The SAS GLM package version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) procedure was used to test the effect of breed on MAF variation. Observed and expected heterozygosities and hierarchical F-statistics were estimated using GENALEX software [11].
