Compilation of candidate retron sequences from known genome sequences
Historically, msDNA has been discovered exclusively in bacteria. A keyword search of NCBI RefSeq bacterial genomes with "reverse transcriptase" returned 34,637 hits, as of September 2, 2015. Following the gene prediction of these genomes using GeneMark, a protein domain search for "Retron-type reverse transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, transposons)" using RPS-BLAST resulted in 16,844 candidate retron sequences.
Alternatively, filtering out nonretron-type reverse transcriptase sequences can be also achieved by extracting protein sequences from the RefSeq annotation, followed by the domain search. Instead, we chose to predict genes from the genome sequences using GeneMark, followed by the domain search. Our approach does not rely on annotation information and has the potential to be applied to newly sequenced genomes as an independent tool.
