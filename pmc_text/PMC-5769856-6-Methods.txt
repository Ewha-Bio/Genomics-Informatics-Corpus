Reproducibility of mutation detection
To check the repeatability and reproducibility of the detection of mutations, especially mutations with a low VAF, we prepared mixtures of the DNAs extracted from four cell lines (H1975, HCT116, HT29, and SW620). NGS experiments were performed in duplicate by different researchers independently.
