Improving spaCy dependency annotation and PoS tagging web service using independent NER services
Dependency parsing is often used as a component in many text analysis pipelines. However, performance, especially in specialized domains, suffers from the presence of complex terminology. Our hypothesis is that including named entity annotations can improve the speed and quality of dependency parses. As part of BLAH5, we built a web service delivering improved dependency parses by taking into account named entity annotations obtained by third party services. Our evaluation shows improved results and better speed.
