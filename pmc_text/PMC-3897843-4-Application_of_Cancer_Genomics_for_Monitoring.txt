He got 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and then followed up regularly with a physical examination, blood test, CT scan, and/or PET scan. At 6 months since the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, he presented with right-side chest pain, and his CT scan showed tumor relapse in the right lung and pleura. He planned systemic anticancer treatment for life prolongation and palliation of symptom, not curative.
The role of CT scan and/or PET scan is not defined [24], but many clinicians use this high-cost image for monitoring relapse. The reason for the popular use of this high-cost image is that there is no other alternative of monitoring cancer status. Recent studies showed the possibility of circulating tumor cell and cell-free DNA as a tool for monitoring tumor status [18, 25]. Cancer genomics enables circulating tumor cell or cell-free DNA to detect relapse earlier than image findings or tumor markers. The delicate delineation of circulating DNA with NGS technologies is an essential part of this success story. No tool is available with a definite clinical benefit for the monitoring of cancer; therefore, we absolutely need new, non-invasive tools for it. Because it takes at least several years to prove the benefit of monitoring, we should start a well-designed prospective study using cancer genomics to prove it as soon as possible.
