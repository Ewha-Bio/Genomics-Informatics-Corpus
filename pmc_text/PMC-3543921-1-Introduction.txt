We are in the genome sequence era. Now, we can all read our genome sequences if we have a bit of time and money. We can know our own program of life given by our fathers and mothers, which consists of 3,000,000,000 bp Ã— 2 of DNA sequence. This knowledge (knowing ourselves) is revolutionizing medicine. The information gives us endless possibilities and a huge number of applications in research and clinical practice of medicine. Preventive medicine, personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacogenetics-these were just dreams on the desk or in the brain of medical scientists and doctors a few years ago but are all achievable at the bedside today.
The best application of the information obtained by genome sequences is an attempt to conquer common diseases or lifestyle-associated diseases. Common diseases are our common problem. It is a serious medical, social, and economical problem all over the world. It's a problem of the present and the future world. The study of our genome has given us a tool to tackle it-the genome-wide association study (GWAS), which is now in full bloom. As we all know, GWASs have succeeded in the identification of susceptibility genes of many common diseases [1].
For more than 15 years, I have been working on genomic studies and committed to the GWAS from its dawn. In this paper, I briefly review a history of human genome research by focusing on GWASs related to my work.
