Substitutions and indels
Green et al. [27] inferred that 10,535,445 substitutions and 479,863 indels have occurred in the modern human genome after the divergence from chimps. The vast majority of these occurred before Neanderthals and modern humans diverged. However, 78 non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions that are fixed for a derived state in modern humans are different in the Neanderthal counterpart, as Neanderthals carry the ancestral state of these polymorphic nucleotides. Only five genes were identified that have more than one fixed substitution in their coding regions, and one of them has an altered start or stop codon. It is particularly interesting that three of these genes are expressed in skin, including RPTN, which encodes the protein repetin, and TRPMI, which encodes melastatin. This might be indicative of a change in selection of skin physiology in the modern human lineage. When looking into differences in regulatory elements, a total of 132 substitutions and 36 indels were identified in the untranslated regions. One microRNA of unknown function, hsa-mir-1304, which was identified by parallel sequencing of human embryonic stem cells [51], was found to have one fixed substitution and one single nucleotide insertion. Since the substitution occurs in the seed region, it is not unlikely that this microRNA has different targets between these two species.
