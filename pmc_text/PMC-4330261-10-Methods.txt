Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean Â± standard error (SE). The non-parametric t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to compare the mean values between the groups with GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All individual experiments were performed at least in duplicate and were repeated five times on separate occasions.
