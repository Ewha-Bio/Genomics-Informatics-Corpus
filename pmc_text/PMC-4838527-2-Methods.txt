Prototype msDNA sequences and their features
We used one of the published Escherichia coli msDNA sequences (GenBank accession No. U02551) [2] as the query in a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) search of NCBI GenBank High Throughput Genomic Sequence (HTGS) division. From the BLASTN hits, we manually curated seven other known msDNA sequences (Table 1). By visual inspection of these prototype msDNA sequences, several common features were recognized: (1) the length of palindrome between the 5' and 3' ends ranged from 5 bp to 10 bp; (2) the distance between both ends ranged from 140 bp to 200 bp; (3) the residues flanking the palindrome were conserved G residues in both strands; and (4) the distance between msr/msd and ret was less than 2 kb.
We developed a local python script that enforces these rules in the candidate retron sequences.
