Study subjects
Subjects from the KARE GWAS have been described [19]. Since it launched in 2001, the total of 10,038 participants have been recruited from the Anseong and Ansan cohorts in the Republic of Korea. Both cohorts were designed to view a variety of quantitative traits from a long-term perspective. Besides, clinical surveys have been performed through epidemiological surveys and physical examinations. Participants have been examined every 2 years, with a third follow-up study in 2008. The analysis of KARE data has been approved by the Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy (KONIBP), Republic of Korea (P01-201311-RS-02-01).
