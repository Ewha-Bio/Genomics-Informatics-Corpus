Substitution diving region
The gene ontology (GO terms) analysis for genes with the lowest substitution rates in Hanwoo and Holstein showed that regulatory genes belong to the low substitution rate gene set. Regulatory genes might be protected genes. The existence of boundaries between the highest and lowest substitution rates showed that there were gaps in substitution rate between protected genes (lowest substitution rates) and unprotected genes (highest substitution rates). Such diving regions might not be the special case in Hanwoo or Holstein. This could provide evidence of differentiation between protected genes and unprotected genes.
