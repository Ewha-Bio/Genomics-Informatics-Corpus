Cell culture
SH-SY5Y (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), a human brain neuronal cell line originated from a neuroblastoma, was a gift from Dr. In Suk Kim, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. SH-SY5Y cells were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% PS (100 units penicillin, 100 µg streptomycin, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, YSA) and were cultured under preconfluent monolayer conditions in 100-mm-diameter polyd-lysine-coated culture dishes at 37℃ with 5% humidified CO2.
