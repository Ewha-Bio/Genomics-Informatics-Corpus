MD simulation of homology models
MD simulations for the modeled proteins were carried out using the Desmond program, an explicit solvent MD package (version 3.1, Desmond Molecular Dynamics System; D. E. Shaw Research, New York, NY, USA and version 3.1, Maestro-Desmond Interoperability Tools; Schrödinger) with inbuilt optimized potentials for liquid simulation (OPLS 2005) force field [23]. The correctness of the chemical structures provided to Desmond was ensured using Protein Preparation Wizard (macro models), Ligprep (chemical molecules), and Epik (ligand protonation states). The system was set up for simulation using a predefined water model (simple point charge, SPC) as solvent in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions specifying the shape and size of box as 10 Å × 10 Å × 10 Å distance. The desirable electrically neutral system for simulation was built with 0.15 M NaCl (physiological concentration of monovalent ions) in 10 Å buffer using the system-built option. The relaxation of the system was achieved by implementing Steepest Descent and the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithms in a hybrid manner. The simulation was performed under NPT ensemble for 5 ns implementing the Berendsen thermostat and barostat methods. A constant temperature of 300 K was maintained throughout the simulation using the Nose-Hoover thermostat algorithm [24] and Martyna-Tobias-Klein Barostat algorithm [25] to maintain 1 atm of pressure, respectively. The short-range coulombic interactions were analyzed using a cut-off value of 9.0 Å using the short-range method. The smooth particle mesh ewald method [26] was used for handling long-range coulombic interactions. Tolerance value usually affects the accuracy of long-range interactions; therefore, a smaller value of 1e-9 is set for accurate computations implemented by the SHAKE algorithm. The final production run was carried out for 5 ns, and the trajectory sampling was done at an interval of 1.0 ps [23].
