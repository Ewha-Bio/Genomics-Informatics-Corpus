When users load the input file, MAP software displays the sample set information and filter options in the 'Source' tab. If any file is not prepared properly, MAP software informs the user in the 'Sample Set Files' tab. After data are loaded, the user can filter the data using the 'Analysis Option' tab based on annotation information. MAP software supports eight filter options for exonic function. By using the mutation calls of each sample, MAP generates the summary metrics (Fig. 2A). Based on user-selected filters in the 'Analysis Options' tab, summary metrics represent additional annotation information, such as gene name, function, known variant, and amino acid change. The additional annotations can be hidden using the SNP filter option in the 'Analysis Option' tab. These mutation metrics are exported into a comma-separated values text file for further investigation.
