Evolutionary conservation of miR-21-3p in various species
To identify miR-21-3p mature sequences in various vertebrate species, miRBase v19.0 (http://www.mirbase.org) was used to analyze. The miR-21-3p structure identification was performed by the mfold Web Server (http://mfold.albany.edu). The evolutionary conservation pattern of various species was examined by Evolutionary Conservation of Genomes (ECR browser; https://ecrbrowser.dcode.org/) in zebrafish, fugu, Tetraodon, chicken, opossum, rat, mouse, cow, dog, and chimpanzee.
