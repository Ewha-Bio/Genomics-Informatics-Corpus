DNA sequencing
Each colony from the different libraries was picked and then inoculated in Luria Broth media containing chloramphenicol and glycerol (10%, final concentration) in a 384-well plate. The cells were cultured at 37℃ for 1 day and stored at -80℃. DNA was isolated using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Initially, 100 clones from each library were selected for the sequencing reaction (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). BLAST sequence homology searches were conducted against the GenBank database after subtracting the vector sequence. Subsequently, 1,260 colonies from the Prebiocide library and 2,600 colonies from the Tank A library were sequenced. The major sequences encoding specific genes were identified from both Prebiocide and Tank A samples on the basis of protein sequences (with more than 75 amino acid residues) from GenBank.
