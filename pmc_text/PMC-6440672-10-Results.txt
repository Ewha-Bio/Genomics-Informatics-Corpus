Clinical results
Descriptive statistics of the clinical information are summarized in Table 1. First, all categorical variables were represented by dummy variables. Note that each variable has less than 30% of observations missing. When we put all variables together, however, they made up more than 40.55% of observations with at least one variable missing. To include cases with missing variables, imputation was performed using the “mice” package.
Variable selection of clinical variables was performed for Cox regression by using stepwise selection procedures. The results are summarized in Table 2. A total of 6 clinical variables were chosen out of 26 variables. Among the 6 variables, platinum status and primal therapy outcome were significant for prognosis at a 5% significance level.
