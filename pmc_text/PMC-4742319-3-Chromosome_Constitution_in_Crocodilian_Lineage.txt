Diploid chromosome numbers in crocodilians range from 30 to 42; most are 32 (Fig. 1) [1920]. Most karyotypes in crocodilians contain 4~5 large bi-armed chromosomes, 20~22 small bi-armed chromosomes, and 4~8 uni-armed chromosomes. However, genome rearrangements among members in the order rarely occurred, giving all crocodilians a fundamental number of 56~60, which suggested that the ancestral crocodilian karyotype was highly conserved [192021222326]. The chromosome number in Alligatoridae (Alligator 2n = 32, and Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus 2n = 42) is more varied than in Crocodylidae (Gavialis and Tomistoma 2n = 32, Mecistops 2n = 30, Osteolaemus 2n = 38, Crocodylus 2n = 30~34). Karyotypes of Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus show a large number of chromosome arms (NF = 60) [1920], suggesting that multiple centric fissions occurred after they diverged from Alligator. However, the largest chromosome variation is found in Crocodylus. The diploid chromosome number of 4 from 12 species (C. porosus, C. siamensis, Crocodylus palustris, and Crocodylus rhombifer) differs from 32, despite having the same fundamental number (58) (Fig. 1). This suggests that centric fusion/fission played a crucial role in the process of chromosomal rearrangements, leading to the formation of ordinal radiation in the lineage of crocodilians.
