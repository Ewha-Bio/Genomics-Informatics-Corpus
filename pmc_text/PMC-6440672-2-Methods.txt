The data used in this study were clinical information and RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov). The National Institutes of Health (NIH)â€™s TCGA webpage provides clinical information, biomedical slide images, molecular information, CpG methylation information, DNA copy number, mRNA expression, and miRNA expression. RNA-Seq data were used, because large amounts of gene expression could be explored collectively from samples in the study. We downloaded genomic alteration data and expression data in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the corresponding clinicopathological profiles from the Genomic Data Commons (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov), Firebrowse (http://firebrowse.org), and cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (http://www.cbioportal.org) web portals. This study complied with TCGA publication guidelines and policies (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/publications/publicationguidelines). The Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital ruled that no formal ethical approval was required in this study.Survival time refers to the period from the diagnosis of HGSC in patients to death. Clinical variables were selected, based on their influence on the outcome. Among 365 HGSC cases, the median survival time for the samples was 43.9 months, and the censoring proportion of the data was 55%.
