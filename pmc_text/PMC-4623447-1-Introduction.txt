The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines biodiversity as "the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns" [12]. CBD has underlined the importance of abundant biodiversity in the sustainable use of natural resources [3]. Moreover, maintaining biological coexistence for all organisms on earth, including animals, plants, and microbes, is imperative for human welfare and quality of life [4]. Thus, many researchers use quantitative measures of biodiversity in an attempt to sustain and restore ecosystems [5].
Biodiversity is generally measured by statistical indices based on the emergence and/or existence of various organisms such as plants, animals, and microbes; these indices can provide quantitative criteria with increased confidence for biodiversity [67]. Of the statistical indices, Shannon-Wiener index [8], species richness, and evenness [9] have been widely used as the gold standards, in spite of traditional methods. The Shannon-Wiener index is based on information theory and is measured using the concept of entropy, and it is applied to estimate the degree of species diversity in a region [10]. Species richness and evenness measure the number of different species per sample and the relative abundance of the different species, respectively [11].
For measuring biodiversity, there are a few non-commercial tools, such as the Vegan package in R [12], EstimateS [13], and the web-based Shannon Entropy Calculator (http:// www.changbioscience.com/genetics/shannon.html). Although they are highly useful, some of them are difficult and complicated for biologists to use, especially some programs involving R package. While the web-based tools are easy to use, they are not suitable for personal and/or big data sets. Furthermore, some programs do not serve any function for long-term investigations of data sets using time-series analyses for biodiversity.
We developed the VBioindex tool to aid scientists in evaluating the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and evenness. Additionally, this program depicts relative dominance for each species. As VBioindex supports biodiversity analyses for a given period (e.g., for a month, quarter, or year), users can easily analyze a variety of biodiversity data while applying a time-series analysis.
