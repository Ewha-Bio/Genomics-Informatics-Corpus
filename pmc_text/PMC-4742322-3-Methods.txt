Whole exome sequencing
Whole exome capture was performed with the SureSelect Human All Exon Kit V4+UTRs (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and massive parallel sequencing was performed with the HiSeq 2000 Sequencing System (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The sequence reads were mapped and aligned to a human reference genome using Burrow-Wheeler Alignment software version 0.7.12 [7]. The Genome Analysis Toolkit 3.0 HaplotypeCaller was used to identify single nucleotide variations, insertions, and deletions by multi-sample calling method [8].
