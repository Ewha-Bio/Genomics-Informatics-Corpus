Within-block relationship
If we looked at each block’s variable plot, we can also understand how each variable in the block affects the canonical variable. The variable plot demonstrates how the variables are positioned within block; therefore, the goal is figuring out the internal relationship between variables. The x-axis is how much each variable influences the first canonical variable, and the y-axis is how much each variable influences the second canonical variable. In Fig. 4, there exist four variable plots, each representing how the variable in each block composes its block. The variables of the SNP block were represented as black points, which were categorized into seven different groups, based on where it is related the most.
We can interpret variable plots through making criteria for the x-axis and y-axis. If a variable exists farther away from the origin, the influence would be greater. We will illustrate group 1’s case in particular, while the interpretation of the other groups could be made, in addition to the first group’s interpretation. In group 1’s variable plot in Fig. 4, compared with the SNP variables, phenotype and disease variables showed more distinguishable features. The 35 SNP variables, which were presented as seven symbols according to their category in the graph, had a similar influence on SNP blocks. In the phenotype block, the variable waist-hip ratio and BMI had almost the same angle from the origin, whereas suprailiac skinfold (Sup) was almost in the opposite location in terms of the second components of the phenotype blocks. This means that waist-hip ratio and BMI gave similar traits compared with other phenotypes. When we considered the first-dimension axis, we could observe that subscapular skinfold (Sub) had a different trait from the other phenotype variables. In terms of disease blocks, we could separate people with disease and people without disease in terms of the x-axis, and hypertension and diabetes were also distinguishable with the y-axis criteria.
It is interesting for us to compare how the variable plot in each group was different. In terms of the SNP variable block, the rs527248 SNP variable had a triangular shape, which means the SNP is related to BMI the most compared with the association with other phenotype variables. Among SNP variables, rs527248, a point located outside of small gray circle in the first quadrant, had the most powerful influence on its canonical variable in all groups. In group 2, the influence of the rs527248 variable was more powerful on the first axis, whereas for groups 1, 3, and 4, there was much influence of the variable on the y-axis.
There are different aspects of the phenotype block’s variables from each group. In group 4, there existed extreme difference between the phenotype variables waist-hip ratio and waist. Whereas the waist-hip ratio variable was more than 1 on the y-axis, the waist variable was near −1, which is exactly the opposite location. If we look at the specific coordinates of the waist-hip ratio and waist variables, the influence of waist-hip ratio on the y-axis was 1.038, but the influence on the x-axis was 0.4966. In contrast, the waist variable in group 3 had a stronger influence on the y-axis than on the x-axis.
From our simple logistic regression, we had information that the SNP variable rs4472504 was related to hypertension disease, which had a p-value of 0.031. In our variable plot, the coordinates of rs4472504 were (−0.2113, −0.082), (−0.0987, 0.3589), (−0.028, 0.1049), and (−0.0995, −0.1101) in each group, respectively, whereas the coordinates of hypertension were (0.4645, 0.1513), (0.364, 0.1043), (0.4955, 0.0146), and (0.5504, −0.0219). Therefore, we cannot conclude that the relationship between a single SNP and a disease cannot be identical to the power of its influence on each axis.
