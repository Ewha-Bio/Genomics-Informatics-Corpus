Exome capture sequencing (simply referred to as "exome sequencing") is a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based technique which targets the genomic sequences of protein-coding regions ("exomes") of a species [1]. Although protein-coding regions constitute only 1% of the human genome, they harbor 85% of the mutations that have significant effects on disease-related traits [2]. Therefore, exome sequencing is a potential contributor to the understanding of diverse human diseases [2].
With a dramatic decrease in the cost and time required for the generation of sequences with high accuracy [3], exome sequencing is now widely used to understand many genetic diseases. For example, in the Netherlands, exome sequencing of ten blood samples from patients with severe intellectual disabilities allowed the identification of five new candidate genes associated with such disabilities [4]. Further, Ng et al. [1] sequenced the exomes of twelve human samples with or without Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS), which is a rare dominantly inherited disorder, and observed an association between the MYH3 gene was responsible for FSS. Furthermore, Huh et al. [5] used exome sequencing to show that the c.234 G > A and c.1150C > T mutations in exon 18 of the HGSNAT gene were common in mucopolysaccharide patients. Exome sequencing techniques have also been used to understand the risks of various cancers, including those of the breast [67], prostate [8], pancreas [9], and others [101112]. Therefore, exome sequencing techniques have become a new primary paradigm for research on genetic diseases and cancers.
One important issue that needs to be addressed for the clinical utilization of NGS-based sequencing data is the adequate depth of sequencing. Sequencing depth is directly related to the cost and time required for the generation, processing, and maintenance of sequencing data [13]. In this vein, several studies have been performed to investigate the impact of sequencing depth on NGS data intended to identify genomic variants. For example, Hou et al. [14] investigated the discovery rates of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants in healthy samples using whole genome sequencing (WGS) at an average sequencing depth of 180×. They observed that most of the variations were identified at an average depth of 100×. Meanwhile, Ajay et al. [15] calculated the genome coverage and discovery rates of variants in healthy samples using WGS data at 100× average mapped depth. The callable portion of the genome was 90% at a depth of 40×, and that of the protein-coding exome region was about 88% at a depth of 100×. However, these studies analyzed sequencing data derived from healthy individuals; the adequate depth required to discover clinically significant variations still needs to be addressed.
In this study, we investigated for the first time the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of genomic variations for clinical use. Toward this, we performed exome sequencing in ten germ-line blood samples from breast cancer patients using the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high depth of ~200×. We also checked the discovery rates of diverse variations as a function of the sequencing depth, using total and diagnostic gene sets.
