Plasma miR-27a expression levels in the validation cohort. (A) Box plot of plasma miR-27a expression level. (B) MiR-27a expression by TNM stage. (C) Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the plasma miR-27a expression level. The plasma miR-27a marker yielded an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.70 with 75% sensitivity and 56% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer.
