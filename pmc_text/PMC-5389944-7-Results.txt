Comparison of Neo4j after optimization
We tested how the optimization of the Neo4j system improved its performance. We compared two servers: optimized versus non-optimized servers. The non-optimized servers had default settings for OS memory and environment. The optimized server had several modified settings in (1) page cache sizing, (2) OS memory, (3) heap memory of the JVM, and (4) the number of open file limits.
We performed the same query on each server to compare the query performance of non-optimized and optimized servers. We measured the time to return results by performing a query to retrieve all data that traverse the relationships among genes, drugs, and diseases that increased the expression of the BRCA1 gene (Supplementary Fig. 1). When the two servers were queried using the same search term, the optimized server returned results in 138 ms, while the non-optimized server returned results in 316 ms for the same query (Fig. 6).
