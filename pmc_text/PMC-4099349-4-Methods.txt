Statistics
We applied a widely used measure of linkage disequilibrium to all pairs of biallelic loci: Lewontin's D' (|D'|) [13] and r2. Haplotypes of each individual were inferred using the PHASE algorithm (ver. 2.0), developed by Stephens et al. [14]. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine the differences in the rates of decline in FEV1 following aspirin challenge among the genotypes and major haplotypes. The data were managed and analyzed using Statistical Analysis System, version 9.2 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Associations for AERD under the logistic model were adjusted by smoking status, atopy, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex (male = 0, female = 1). Significant associations are shown in boldface (p < 0.05).
