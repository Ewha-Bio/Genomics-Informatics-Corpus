Schematic diagram of multicopy single-stranded DNA synthesis. (A) A precursor RNA molecule with the characteristic palindrome (green). "G" residues in a circle or box (red) are conserved. (B) Reverse transcription yielding cDNA (black). (C) The final msDNA chimera. Adapted from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicopy_single-stranded_DNA).
