Assembling signature fragments
Several overlapping fragments were obtained, based on the sequences of each reference strain. To facilitate subsequent analysis steps, the overlapping fragments were assembled using DNA Dragon software, version 1.6.0 (http://www.dna-dragon.com/).
The settings were designed with minimum overlaps (100 bases) along the diagonal length, a minimum %-identity of complete overlapping fragments, and 100% full-search parameters.
