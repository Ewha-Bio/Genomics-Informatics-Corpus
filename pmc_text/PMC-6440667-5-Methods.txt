Genotyping and quality control
Genomic DNA was separated from venous blood samples, and 200 ng was genotyped using a Hybridization on Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.0-96 Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PLINK program version 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) was used for the quality control process for the raw genotype data, resulting in a total of 586,730 SNPs to be used. SNPs with case and control minor allele frequencies less than 1%, case or control call rates less than 95% or a significant deviation from Hardyâ€“Weinberg equilibrium in the controls (p < 0.0001) were excluded.
