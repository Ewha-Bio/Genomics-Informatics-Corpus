Protein structure modeling
Before the structural modeling, the protein features related to the somatic mutations were found by BLAST on UniProt (10 most similar proteins, expectation value = 1e-30) and residue mapping. Homology modeling was performed using MODELLER (http://salilab.org/modeller) with the templates 1LWD for IDH2, 3KSY for RASGEF1B, and 2O8B for MSH4. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed with GROMACS (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct700301q). The structural images were drawn using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).
