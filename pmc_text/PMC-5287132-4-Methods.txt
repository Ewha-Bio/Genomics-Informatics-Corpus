CD-HIT analysis
The proteins were subjected to Cluster Database at High Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) analysis (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi) [17]. The program takes a FASTA format sequence database as input and produces a set of non-redundant, representative sequences as output. The process was carried out with a sequence identity cutoff of 0.6, thus eliminating redundant sequences with more than 60% identity [181920]. The resultant proteins were grouped as Set1 proteome.
