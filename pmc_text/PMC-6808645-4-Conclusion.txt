Improvement of neoantigen prediction from patient samples is an important issue for developing effective immunotherapy. Current approaches to neoantigen prediction have focused on somatic mutations, even though genetic changes affecting protein production can occur at many different levels. Most computational tools developed so far have aimed to evaluate the effect of non-synonymous DNA variants on producing mutated peptides. Representative analysis pipelines such as pVAC-Seq [38] and Neopepsee [39] have been established for somatic mutation analysis.
The recent studies described herein suggest that alternative splicing and RNA editing can serve as important sources of neoantigens. The challenge in utilizing RNA-derived neoantigens is the development of bioinformatics methods with increased accuracy and performance. RNA-Seq is now a popular technique, and data on RNA-Seq have been accumulating on a daily basis. However, many researchers feel that it is not easy to detect posttranscriptional modifications, such as alternative splicing and RNA editing. Therefore, improvement of the analysis pipeline will be required to make the RNA-derived neoantigen prediction more reliable.
