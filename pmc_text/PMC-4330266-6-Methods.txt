Protein-ligand docking
Protein-ligand docking studies were performed using the AutoDock 4.2 program [25]. It is one of the most widely used methods for protein-ligand docking. All pre-processing steps for the ligand and protein files were performed using the AutoDock Tools 1.5.4 program (ADT), which has been released as an extension suite to Python Molecular Viewer [25]. The ADT program was used to prepare the receptor molecule (rpoB) by adding all hydrogen atoms to the receptor, and Kollman charges were also assigned. For docked ligands, non-polar hydrogens were also added. Gasteiger charges were assigned, and torsional degrees of freedom were allocated by the ADT program.
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was applied to model the interaction pattern between the receptor and ligand. The grid maps representing the receptor proteins in the docking process were calculated using AutoGrid (part of the AutoDock package). A grid of 50, 50, and 50 points in the x, y, and z directions was centered on the known active site residues of rpoB protein. For all docking procedures, 10 independent genetic algorithm runs with a population size of 150 were considered for each molecule under study. A maximum number of 25 Ã— 105 energy evaluations; 27,000 maximum generations; a gene mutation rate of 0.02, and a crossover rate of 0.8 were used for the LGA. The AutoDock program was run in order to prepare the corresponding docking log (DLG) file for further analysis.
