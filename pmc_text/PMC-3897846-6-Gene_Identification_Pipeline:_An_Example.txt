To help readers who have limited experience with NGS data to understand the workflow, in this section we will show a real example of a pipeline that was used to process whole-exome sequencing data from raw sequences to a ranked candidate gene list (Fig. 1). The pipeline is constructed, based on the three-phase organization, as described in the previous sections. We start from raw sequence FASTQ files and assume no quality control has been performed or reported. Please note that each tool is likely to require dependent files, such as the reference genome, the 1000 Genome variants, dbSNP variants, and the genome feature file in GFF3 format, etc.
