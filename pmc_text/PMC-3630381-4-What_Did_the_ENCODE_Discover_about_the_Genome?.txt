Nucleosome positioning
In contrast to histone modifications, which are identified by ChIP-seq, nucleosome positioning data were generated without immunoprecipitation by using micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by sequencing [19-21]. The method that distinguishes nucleosome positioning is based on the ability of nucleosomes to protect related DNA from digestion by enzyme [22]. Protected fragments are sequenced to produce genomewide maps of nucleosome localization. By using a new tool, the ENCODE project has identified the differences in patterns of nucleosome positioning around the majority of transcription factor binding sites [8]. These data have tremendous value for analyzing the relationship between transcription factor binding, histone modifications, and gene expression regulation.
