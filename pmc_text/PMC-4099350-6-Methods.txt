Protein-ligand docking
Protein-ligand docking studies were performed using the AutoDock 4.2 program [28]. It is one of the most widely used methods for protein-ligand docking. All the pre-processing steps for ligand and protein files were performed using AutoDock Tools 1.5.4 (ADT), which has been released as an extension suite to the Python Molecular Viewer [28]. ADT was used to prepare the receptor molecule (HPV-16 E6) by adding all hydrogen atoms into carbon atoms of the receptor, and Kollman charges were also assigned. For docked ligands, non-polar hydrogens were also added. Gasteiger charges were assigned and torsions degrees of freedom were allocated by ADT.
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was applied to model the interaction pattern between the E6 oncogenic protein and selected inhibitors. The grid maps representing the receptor proteins in the docking process were calculated using AutoGrid (part of the AutoDock package). A grid of 50, 50, and 50 points in the x, y, and z directions was centered on the p53-binding sites of E6 proteins. For all docking procedures, 10 independent genetic algorithm runs with a population size of 150 were considered for each molecule under study. A maximum number of 25 Ã— 105 energy evaluations, 27,000 maximum generations, a gene mutation rate of 0.02, and a crossover rate of 0.8 were used for the LGA. Autodock was run in order to prepare corresponding docking log file (DLG) files for further analysis.
