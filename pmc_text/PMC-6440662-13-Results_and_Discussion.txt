Virulent proteins
Gram-negative bacteria undergo frequent genomic alterations and consequent evolutions thus increasing their virulence inside the host environment [89]. We have found 2 HPs that showed positive virulence scores servers among the Hconf proteins. These have been listed in Supplementary Table 8. It had already been hypothesized that targeting VF provides a better therapeutic intervention strategy against bacterial pathogenesis [89]. Predicted HPs having virulent characteristics thus provide powerful target-based therapies for the mitigation of an existing infection and are further considered as an adjunct therapy to existing antibiotics, or potentiators of the host immune response [90].
