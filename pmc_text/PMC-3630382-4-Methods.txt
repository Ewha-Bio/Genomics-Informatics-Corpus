Identification of somatic mutations
We had developed a bioinformatics pipeline for this award program (Fig. 1). VarScan [2] was used to identify somatic mutations. The output of VarScan was filtered as follows: somatic p-value ≤ 0.05, normal allele depth ≤ 1, tumor allele depth ≥ 5, tumor total depth ≥ 10. The mutation set was annotated using a custom-made script with refSeq, SIFT (http://sift.jcvi.org/), MutationAssessor, phyloP46way (vertebrate), dbSNP 137 [3], in-house Korean variation database, etc. We selected the driver mutations that were not in dbSNP 137, excluding clinically associated variants (Flagged track in University of California Santa Cruz [UCSC] Genome Browser) and an in-house Korean variation database, and were deleterious missense, nonsense, read-through, splicesite, or coding indel mutations (NS/SS/I). The deleterious missense mutations were determined if at least 2 out of the following 3 were true: PhyloP score > 1.5, SIFT prediction = deleterious, MutationAssessor Func. Impact = high or medium.
The total numbers of candidates for each filtering step are summarized in Fig. 1. We found somatic mutations in samples G10, G08, and G09, but they were not NS/SS/I.
