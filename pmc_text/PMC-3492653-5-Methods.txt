SNP selection and GRS calculation
In the association of SNPs with CRC, the SNPs with p < 10-5 in Korean men were: rs17391002 (CXCL12), rs9549448 (SOX1), rs254833 (MYO10), rs2553614 (TMEM71), rs13153032 (NSUN2), rs2288073 (FLJ30851), rs9604214 (SOX1), rs9865670 (OPA1), rs17186320 (KIAA1009), rs1509497 (RFX8), rs235428 (PHF20L1), rs9845920 (OPA1), rs9846212 (OPA1), rs6763744 (OPA1), rs4128317 (ALK), rs7646304 (OPA1), rs17047306 (SPATA17), rs1490338 (SPATA17), rs902351 (SPATA17), and rs2543662 (ITSN2) (Supplementary Table 1). The SNPs with p < 10-5 in Korean women in the association between SNPs and CRC were: rs10083736 (GOT2), rs16987827 (DHX35), rs8046516 (GOT2), rs9926182 (GOT2), rs17523778 (FAM174B), rs4974411 (TPRA1), rs1834902 (H2AFY), rs16895308 (MAST4), rs8032832 (FAM174B), rs6901560 (PD6), rs11025480 (PRMT3), rs3814110 (BNC2), rs16895307 (MAST4), rs7089063 (MARCH8), rs16893688 (IBTK), rs6861487 (MAST4), rs9613463 (MN1), rs11242237 (H2AFY), rs11150094 (WWOX), and rs9625253 (MN1) (Supplementary Table 2). Each SNP in this study was assumed to be associated with risk according to an additive genetic model, which performs well, even when the true genetic model may not be known or may be incorrectly specified [30].
A GRS was calculated on the basis of reproducible tagging of SNP-associated loci reaching genomewide levels of significance. In this study, the GRS was calculated with the 3 SNPs in Korean men and 5 SNPs in Korean women showing the strongest association with CRC (p < 10-6). The GRS was created by two methods: a simple count method (count GRS) and a weighted method (weighted GRS) [31, 32]. Both methods anticipated each SNP to be independently associated with risk. We assumed an additive genetic model for each SNP, applying a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 to genotypes containing 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles, respectively. This model is known to perform well, even when the true genetic model is unknown or wrongly specified [30]. The count model assumes that each SNP in the panel contributes equally to the risk for CRC and was calculated by summing the values for each of the SNPs. The weighted GRS was calculated by multiplying each beta-coefficient by the number of corresponding risk alleles (0, 1, 2).
