Identification of LEF1 as a KD susceptibility gene specifically associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age.
To identify the genetic variants affecting two extreme age subgroups of KD patients (younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age), we performed an age-stratified GWAS using 19 KD cases younger than 6 months or 45 KD cases older than 5 years of age, respectively, compared to 1,000 controls. A total of 12 SNPs for patients younger than 6 months and 14 SNPs for those older than 5 years of age were chosen for the replication study on the basis of our arbitrary threshold (p ＜ 1×10-4 and genes related to immune functions) for each subgroup. Among 26 candidate SNPs tested in the replication study (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), only a nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the LEF1 gene was validated in Korean KD patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 5.92; p = 0.000268 in GWAS and OR, 2.60; p = 0.00126 in the replication study) (Table 1). The combined analysis of the Korean GWAS and replication for LEF1 SNP (rs4365796) showed very significant association with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (118 cases vs. 4,553 controls; OR, 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 3). To further validate our findings in another population, we also performed a replication study in the Japanese cohort comprised of 1,306 KD cases and 6,893 controls. The SNP rs4365796 in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was statistically not significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397) (Table 1). In a meta-analysis of Korean and Japanese data, a significant association was observed in KD patients younger than 6 months of age (OR, 2.50; p = 5.01 × 10-5), whereas no association was detected in KD patients older than 6 months of age (OR, 1.10; p = 0.342) (Table 1). This result indicates that the LEF1 gene is a novel susceptibility gene specifically affecting KD patients younger than 6 months of age.
To determine the effect of the LEF1 risk allele on clinical features of KD patients, we examined the clinical data classified by the LEF1 genotypes (rs4365796, risk allele: T) in 1,656 Korean KD patients (number of genotype: CC = 1,559, CT/TT = 96/1). When we investigated the effect of genotype of the LEF1 risk allele in two KD subgroups (younger than 6 months and older than 6 months of age), the risk allele did not show any significant effect on any clinical variables in KD patients with one exception; the risk genotypes (either CT or TT) of the LEF1 gene (rs4365796) had slightly increased CRP levels (median, 8.48 mg/L; p = 0.032) in KD patients older than 6 months of age compared to the non-risk genotype (CC) of the LEF1 gene (median, 6.50 mg/L) (Supplementary Table 4).
