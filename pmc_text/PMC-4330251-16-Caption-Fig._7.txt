Methylation heat map of four SFRP1 probes. SFRP1 is marked by a vertical red line in the ideogram of chromosome 8, while tracks of CpG islands and exon-intron structures are shown. The heat map in methylation profile track shows the methylation beta-values of the four probes (cg06166767, cg13398291, cg15839448, and cg22418909 from left to right). Each row of the heat map represents one of the samples, which are ordered as shown by the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) sample codes. The last two digits of the TCGA sample codes represent sample types: "01" for tumor sample and "11" for matched normal.
