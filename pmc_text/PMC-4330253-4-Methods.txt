Study genotypes
The genotyping of the cohort population was previously described for the KARE study [16]. Most DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of participants and genotyped using Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The quality control steps of the genotypes have been described elsewhere [13]. Briefly, the calling of the genotyping was determined by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance genotyping algorithm [17]. Consequently, 352,227 SNPs had a missing genotype call rate below 0.1, a minor allele frequency greater than 0.01, and no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 1 Ã— 10-6). Additionally, the previous GWAS reported no population stratification between the Anseong and Ansan cohorts [13].
