SNPs associated with medication adherence
The GWAS for medication adherence in 1,067 medication adherents and 235 medication non-adherents showed multiple SNPs with a suggestive association (Fig. 2). The QQ plot showed that most of the observed associations lay close to the expected distribution, conforming to the null hypothesis of no association. The genomic inflation factor was 1.00, indicating no evidence of inflation in the test statistics due to population stratification or other sources. SNPs with a suggestive genome-wide association (p < 1 × 10-5) are shown in Table 2. Although no SNP met the criteria of genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8), four loci (rs6978712, rs10487488, rs7690819, rs11973012) with suggestive significance were identified. The most significant SNP was rs6978712 (p = 4.87 × 10-7), which is located proximal to the GCC1 gene, which was previously implicated in decision-making capability in drug abusers [15]. Three SNPs on chromosome 7 were in close proximity, and Fig. 3 shows a regional association for these SNPs proximal to the GCC1 gene.
