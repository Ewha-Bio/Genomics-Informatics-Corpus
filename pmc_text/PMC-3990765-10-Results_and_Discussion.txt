Conclusion
Our analysis was able to identify ethnically variable SNPs associated with phenotypic changes. We selected 9,306 ESNPs and 5,167 ECNPs in 72 Pan-Asian populations. We found that representative ethnic groups with specific ESNPs are recently branched-out subpopulations, whereas representative ethnic groups with ethnic specific CNPs are early fixed subpopulations, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. This likely occurred due to accelerated and accumulated genetic drifts or selective pressure. This shows that ESNPs may participate in the ongoing creation of genetic variation through selective pressure or selective sweep. These ethnically specific variations are associated with 156 ESNP-related genes and 52 ECNP-related genes. Ethnically specific genetic variations may affect phenotype variation and disease susceptibility. Although it is not enough information to compare ECNP distribution and ESNP distribution directly, significant gene sets having ESNPs or ECNPs can be useful to study disease risk and drug susceptibility.
