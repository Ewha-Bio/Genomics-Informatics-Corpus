Polymorphism location in promoter region and linkage disequilibrium (LD). Coding exons are marked by black blocks, and untranslated regions are marked by white blocks. The first base of the translational site is denoted as nucleotide +1. (A) AKT2 location of promoter polymorphisms and LD block. (B) AKT3 location of promoter polymorphisms. The LD of AKT3 polymorphisms was not identified. aFurther analyses polymorphism sites.
