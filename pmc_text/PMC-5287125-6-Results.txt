IL10 polymorphisms and survival
Genotype frequencies of four SNPs in the IL10 gene are listed in Tables 3 and 4. The MAF of rs1800872 was the highest among the four SNPs.
Of the four polymorphisms, rs1800871 and rs1800872 of the IL10 gene represented a marginal association with both OS (p = 0.094 and p = 0.058) and PFS (p = 0.051 and p = 0.077) (Tables 3 and 4) in B-cell lymphoma patients treated by R-CHOP, based on additive models. Using an additive model for the reference allele, the HR for rs1800871 was 0.64 times for OS (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.08) and 0.60 times for PFS (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) as one minor allele increases in B-cell lymphoma patients treated with an R-CHOP regimen (Tables 3 and 4).
