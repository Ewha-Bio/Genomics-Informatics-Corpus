The overview of our analysis. The RNA-seq raw reads were filtered by a quality score, and then, the filtered reads were mapped to a reference genome using SHRiMP2. After mapping, filtration with mapping quality was carried out using Samtools. The filtered mapped reads and genotype data were analyzed by IVAS in order to obtain the candidate splicing quantitative trait loci.
