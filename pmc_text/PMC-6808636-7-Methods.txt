Imputation of HLA alleles
We used SNP2HLA [5] to impute HLA information for the 58C and UKBS cohorts, where the HLA information was generated as binary markers for (1) HLA alleles, (2) amino acid residues, and (3) intragenic SNPs. For the reference panel for imputation, we employed the Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium dataset, which consists of 5,225 individuals of European ancestry [9]. The genomic region was restricted to the MHC complex region (chr6:29-34Mb, hg18) on chromosome 6 before imputation. As a result, we obtained the imputed genotypes of 8,961 binary markers, which were composed of 424 markers for HLA alleles (e.g., HLA_A_0101; the presence of HLA-A*01:01 allele in the HLA-A gene), 1,276 markers for amino acid residues (e.g., AA_A_245_30020064_V; the presence of valine at the 245th amino acid position of the HLA-A gene), 1,390 markers for intragenic SNPs (e.g., SNP_A_30020064; the intragenic SNP at base position of 30020064 in the HLA-A gene), and 5,871 markers for genomic variants (e.g., rs969931).
