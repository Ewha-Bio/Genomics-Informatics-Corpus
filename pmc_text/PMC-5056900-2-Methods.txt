Clinical information
Samples from tumors diagnosed between 2011 and 2014 were collected from Dankook University Hospital (Cheonan) in South Korea. Five formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from NKTCL were analyzed. NKTCL was diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Organization classification [10]. In all cases, immunohistochemical studies for CD3, CD56, and granzyme B, as well as EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization, were carried out with the FFPE tissues. All immunohistochemical results were positive for the markers, but one case was negative for EBV (Supplementary Fig. 2). Patient ages ranged from 46 to 80 years. One case was from the submandibular region. The remainder was from the nasal cavity. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the information of the enrolled subjects.
