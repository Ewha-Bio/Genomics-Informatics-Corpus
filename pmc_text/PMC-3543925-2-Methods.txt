Study participants and genotyping
The Korea Association Resource (KARE) study recruited 10,038 participants aged 40 years to 69 years from the rural Ansung and urban Ansan cohorts and has been previously described in detail [6]; 1,196 subjects were excluded due to poor genotyping data, and we also excluded subjects with prehypertensive status (120 mm Hg < SBP < 140 mm Hg and/or 80 mm Hg < DBP < 90 mm Hg). In total, 6,420 participants-1,968 hypertensive cases with hypertensive therapy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and 4,452 controls with SBP ≤ 120 mm Hg and DBP ≤ 80 mm Hg-were examined for a hypertension case control study.
The Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to genotype KARE study individuals. The accuracy of the genotyping was examined by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis distance (BRLMM) genotyping algorithm [7]. The sample and SNP quality control criteria have been described [6]. In brief, samples with accuracies that were lower than 98%, high missing genotype call rates (≥4%), high heterozygosity (>30%), or gender biases were excluded. SNPs were excluded according to filter criteria as follows: SNP call rate > 5%, minor allele frequency < 0.01, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p < 1 × 10-6. After quality control, 8,842 individuals and 352,228 markers remained.
