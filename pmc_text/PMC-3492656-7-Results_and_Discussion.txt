Genetic diversity among Ethiopian cattle populations
An examination of the variability within breeds was carried out to compare the level of hererozygosity between the populations, and the results are presented in Table 4. Across the sampled Ethiopian cattle populations, the mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.314 ± 0.001 and 0.313 ± 0.001, respectively. The mean values were lower than the values reported from a microsatellite markers analysis [1]. However, they were in concurrence with the values reported using SNPs for the Angus breed (0.332) [14] and for sheep breeds [5].
The overall estimated F-statistics were FIS = -0.003 (within-population inbreeding estimates) and FIT = 0.016 (total inbreeding). Among the Ethiopian cattle populations, genetic differentiation (FST) was estimated at 0.019. Genetic characterization of Ethiopian cattle breeds using microsatellites reported within-population inbreeding of 0.071, total inbreeding of 0.083, and genetic differentiation of 0.013 [1]. The FST for Ethiopian cattle populations was low, which could be due to their common ancestral origin.
There were loci significantly deviating from HWE. Overall, significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (p < 0.05) was observed for 405 markers in Ethiopian cattle populations (Ambo, 441; Arsi, 475; Borana, 314; Danakil, 314; and Horro, 481) and in 549 of the markers in Hanwoo. The highest number of SNPs that departed from HWE was observed in Hanwoo cattle, whereas within the Ethiopia cattle populations, Borana displayed lower proportions of markers (SNPs) deviating from HWE. The variation in proportion of SNPs displaying deviation from HWE among the sampled populations could be explained by selection pressure and population structure (stratification, admixture).
In conclusion, a significant difference was detected for the rate of polymorphisms and MAFs between the Hanwoo and the Ethiopian cattle populations. The level of variation identified in this particular study highlights that these markers can be potentially used for genetic studies in African cattle populations. The high within-breed diversity observed in Ethiopian indigenous cattle populations could be an opportunity and allow improvements through within-population selection schemes.
