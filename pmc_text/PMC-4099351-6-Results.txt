The presence of Gm18 modification bases were analyzed in total tRNAs of M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL1, N. hamburgensis, N. winogradskyi, and N. oceani. These organisms' tRNA contains a G residue at the 18th position adjacent to the anticodon loop, except tRNAMet, tRNAPro, and tRNAVal (Table 1). Furthermore, the 18th position of tRNAs in M. aquaeolei (51 tRNAs) and M. MWYL1 (83 tRNAs) contain thymine (T), cytosine (C), or adenine (A) instead of G residue. M. aquaeolei's tRNAMetCAT (two copies), tRNAProCGG, tRNAProCGG, and tRNAProTGG have T instead of G residues. M. MWYL1 contains 9 copies of tRNAMetCAT; of these, six tRNAs have a T residue at the 18th position and three contain a G residue at the 18th position. Only three proline-specific tRNAs are formed in M. MWYL1, and all of them show a T base at the 18th position instead of G. The organism N. hamburgensis comprises 50 tRNA subsets; among these, eight tRNAs showed no G residue at the 18th position, and the rest of the 42 had a G residue. Thus, the tRNAs without G residues are tRNAMetCAT, tRNAProCGG (three copies), tRNAProGGG, tRNAProTGG, and tRNAValGAC. Therefore, eight tRNAs at the 18th position show T, C, or A. Besides tRNAMetCAT, tRNAProCGG and tRNAProGGG show a C residue, and tRNAProCGG and tRNAProTGG hold a T residue at the 18th position. Nevertheless, tRNAValGAC confirmed an A residue at the 18th position. Among six proline-specific tRNAs (tRNAProCGG), only one showed a G residue at the 18th position. Furthermore, N. winogradskyi and N. oceani revealed 47 and 45 tRNAs, respectively. These two organisms hold similar properties-i.e., tRNA subsets, like tRNAMetCAT, tRNAProCGG, tRNAProGGG, and tRNAProTGG, containing a T residue at the 18th position as a substitute for the G residue.
