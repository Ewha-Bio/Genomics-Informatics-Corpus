StringTie is software used for transcriptome reconstruction and abundance estimation. Similarly to other tools, including Cufflinks, spliced aligners such as TopHat2 [37] or GSNAP [19] are used to directly align RNA-seq reads or subsequent alignment after generating pre-assembled contigs from the reads using a de novo assembler such as MaSurCa [38]. StringTie can perform transcriptome reconstruction and abundance estimation simultaneously by building a flow network for the path of the heaviest coverage and computing the maximum flow to estimate abundance. StringTie reports estimated abundance in FPKM for paired-end and RPKM for single-end.
