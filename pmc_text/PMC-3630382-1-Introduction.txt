Thanks to the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, genomics research area has been developed dramatically in recent years. Since 2008, many efforts have been made to find somatic mutations in cancer genomes; hundreds of samples by exome sequencing have been used to develop diagnosis and prognosis markers in various cancers in recent researches. Cheaper price has enabled us to get more exome sequencing data from hundreds of samples, even thousands of genomes.
By applying exome sequencing to cancer genomes, we can discover somatic mutations and somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) on a massive and genome-wide scale. Traditionally, array-based comparative genomic hybridization has been used to discover SCNA, but exome sequencing has many advantages, in that one can derive various results, such as somatic mutations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), and SCNA. It is still under debate because bioinformatics methods could give different results depending on their parameters and software, but major driver genes of somatic mutations show a similar consensus.
We had used an in-house bioinformatics pipeline and databases for this research, especially "somatic copy-number and heterozygosity alteration estimation" (SCHALE) to find LOH and SCNA. Furthermore, driver genes were also inferred from network and pathway analyses. Protein structure prediction was used to predict putative structural changes by somatic mutations and also possibly their functional changes.
