Network representations have been used to describe interactions between entities of interest in various areas. In particular, network representations are useful to analyze and visualize complex biological activities. Global patterns in a large-scale complex system can be shown by representing the entities and their interactions with nodes and edges, respectively. For instance, Schwikowski et al. [1] created protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to predict novel protein functions in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using the network representations, it was found that 2,358 among 2,709 total interactions compose a single large network. Also, biological pathway databases, such as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) [2] and Reactome [3], provide numerous pathways that are represented by networks with nodes of molecules and directed edges of their actions. In addition, various mathematical properties and models of a network have been developed in graph theory. Several reviews [4-6] have illustrated the mathematical properties and topological characteristics of a network with biological systems.
The advance of high-throughput technologies, including DNA microarray [7], next-generation sequencing [8], and the two-hybrid screening system [9], has led to the large-scale datasets in genomics and proteomics, which are referred to as 'omics' data. These omics data have been collected and organized to identify biological functions. This paper focuses on biological network analysis related to omics data, such as gene expression levels and PPIs. We first report several major public interaction databases for the omics data and then introduce two major topics in network biology: reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and network-based applications, including protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and network-based genome-wide association study.
