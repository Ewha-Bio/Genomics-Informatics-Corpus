In this section, we shall present the implementation of the proposed approach using real data. Meanwhile, we shall discuss the practical outputs and implementations in details. We will use the segmented genomes of flu virus, and segments of Ebola virus as composite data points.
One of the highly mutable viruses is the flu virus, and it has serious negative impacts on various populations (e.g., human population). The genome of influenza virus has eight segments, and each segment can be encoded into either 1 or 2 proteins. The virus is classified under the family Orthomyxoviridae [10-12]. The eleven RNA-proteins of influenza virus genome are: PB1 (polymerase protein), PB2 (polymerase protein), PA (polymerase protein), HA (haemagglutinin protein), NP (nucleoprotein), NA (neuraminidase), M1 (matrix protein), M2 (matrix protein), NS1 (non-structural protein), and NS2 (non-structural protein). The variability of the influenza virus is embedded in the genetic text of the two surface proteins: (1) HA and NA [13, 14]. The identification of influenza sub-type can be accomplished using the variability of HA and NA proteins.
The other composite data point that we shall consider in this paper is Ebola virus. The Ebola virus is a negative-sense RNA virus, and it is classified under the family Filoviridae [15]. The genome of Ebola has seven segments. The seven RNA proteins of Ebola virus genome are follows: nucleoprotein (NP), nucleocapsid protein (VP35), matrix protein (VP40), glycoprotein (GP), nucleocapsid protein (VP30), nucleocapsid protein (VP24), and polymerase protein (L).
To proceed further, we downloaded a few composite data points from on-line databases. The composite data points represent the segmented genomes of influenza virus type A, influenza virus type B, and Ebola virus. Consequently, we compose a family of variance-covariance matrices for the composite data point: influenza virus type A, which it has 4 instances: the first instance: α = 1, L = 50, and n = 1; the second instance: α = 1, L = 50, and n = 2; the third instance: α = 1, L = 50, and n = 3; and the forth instance: α = 1, L = 50, and n = 4. Each instance represents an information structure of the composite data point, and each undirected graph represents an insight of the information structure. To measure the seriousness of difference in a family of variance-covariance matrices, we depict those instances in Figs. 3–6. From those figures we can conclude the seriousness of the difference caused by considering different feature vectors. Fig. 3 has the highest variability (spread) compared with Figs. 4–6. In other words, in the graph, the distances among nodes can be used as an indicator about the seriousness of the difference caused by biodiversity and/or variability to detect new variants.
In the second part of this experiment, we compare three composite data points. Each composite data point is a segmented genome. Those composite data points are follows: (1) influenza virus type A, (2) influenza virus type B, and (3) Ebola virus. We compose a family of variance-covariance matrices with three instances using the following parameters: α = 1, L = 80, and n = 1. Figs. 7–9 depict those instances respectively. It is clear that the insights of inner information structure of those composite data points are different in terms of distance-variability and inner information structure, and this variability reflects the genetic diversity in the segmented genomes of the considered viruses.
Another comparison can be conducted between the two instances of variance-covariance matrices given in Figs. 3 and 7, and it is clear that the seriousness of the difference occurs between the two instances due to the window-size.
Based on these results, we should shift the purpose of this approach to the level of a tool. This tool can help researchers and users in the field of computational biology to understand and evaluate the mechanisms of window-based approaches, and to understand the segmented genetic variation of a composite data point through depicting the seriousness of the difference among information structures extracted from a given composite data point using window-based mechanism. In addition, the tool can be used to visualize the genetic diversity of composite data points.
We presented experiments and results, and in the next section, we shall present conclusions and future work.
In this paper, we have analyzed window-based mechanism approach as a sequence analysis approach. We introduced the terminology: the seriousness of the difference, composite data point, data insight, and information structure. There is a difficulty in measuring the seriousness of the difference among the existing insights of information structure in a composite data point. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: we proposed the concept of a family of variance-covariance matrices, where each instance of this family is a set of variance-covariance matrices, which represents a data-insight about the information structure of a composite data point. We proposed an alternative approach to measure the seriousness of the difference among data-insights extracted from a composite data point by using undirected graph and Mosaab-metric space to visualize the differences caused by estimates of the parameters: (1) window-length or size (L), (2) shifting distance (α), and (3) random feature vector (Xn). This approach can be used to evaluate window-based sequence analysis algorithms, and to capture segmented genetic variation and diversity in composite data points. The approach can be used to answer critical biological questions: for example, are the corresponding segments of influenza A and B similar in distance? Can we capture the rates of change in those segments? Which may be interesting to epidemiologists. Finally, as future work, we can use this approach as an integrated tool to visualize the diversity and variability of outliers (variants) in a dataset of composite data points.
