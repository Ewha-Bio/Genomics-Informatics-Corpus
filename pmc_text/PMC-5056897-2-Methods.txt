Data abstraction
In this study, the primary source of genome data is National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome database. We extracted preliminary information using "Helicobacter pylori" string that redirects to the genomewide project report of H. pylori genome. We selected H. pylori 26695 strain from the database with the Accession Code RefSeq NC_000915.1. The genome contains 1,555 genes coding for 1,445 proteins. We then extracted the hypothetical proteins from the pool of 1,445 proteins. We used Uniprot for retrieving Uniprot IDs and fasta sequences of the HPs using their Protein Product IDs (e.g., NP_206816.1). Fasta sequences of the HPs retrieved from Uniprot were used for further analysis.
