miR-27a expression level in paired gastric cancer tissues. (A) Box plot of miR-27a expression level (n= 73). (B) MiR-27a expression level by TNM stage. (C) The receiver-operator characteristic curve and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) value were estimated using R software. The miR-27a expression level was normalized to U6snRNA. (D) Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient survival based on miR-27a expression in gastric tumors. The log-rank test was used to compare survival between the low- and high- miR-27a expression groups of patients on the basis of average miR-27a expression.
