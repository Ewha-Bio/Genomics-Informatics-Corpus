DNA preparation
FFPE tissue samples were deparaffinized in xylene, and 3-to 5-mm thick sections were extracted from the samples. Using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), we isolated genomic DNA from the samples following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality control results of the DNA preparations are illustrated in Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3.
