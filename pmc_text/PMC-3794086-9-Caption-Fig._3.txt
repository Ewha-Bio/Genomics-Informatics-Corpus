Interaction network between traits based on biological process Gene Ontology semantic similarity. Pairs of traits having the semantic similarity greater than 0.75 are connected. On the other hand, the edge color represents the direction of phenotypic correlations (red and green for positive and negative correlations, respectively), and the brightness of the line represents the level of correlation (the brighter the higher correlation, and the darker the lower correlation).
