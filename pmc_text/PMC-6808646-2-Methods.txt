Oligonucleotides, medium, and DNA samples
All the synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Yeast cells were cultivated in YES medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, and appropriate amino acid supplements) at 30℃ unless otherwise stated, following the manufacturer’s instructions [11]. Genomic DNA from the fission yeast gene deletion library was extracted using the Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial kit (catalog #D6005, Zymo Research Co., Irvine, CA, USA).
