Lipoprotein
Bacterial lipoproteins are a set of membrane proteins with many different functions. Due to this broad-ranging functionality, these proteins have a considerable significance in many phenomena, from cellular physiology through cell division and virulence [82]. Lipoprotein of gram-negative bacteria is essential for growth and division [83]. In our analysis, we report a total of 4 lipoproteins from the group of HPs predicted in this study. It has been also revealed that lipoproteins may function as vaccines [82]. The knowledge of these facts may be utilized for the generation of novel countermeasures to bacterial diseases [82].
