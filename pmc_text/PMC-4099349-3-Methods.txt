SNP selection and genotyping
To investigate the associations between TEC polymorphisms and the risk of AERD, we selected candidate SNPs based on allele frequencies in the Asian population, linkage disequilibrium (LD) status, and National Center for Biotechnology information. The data for selection were obtained from the International HapMap database (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Genotyping of 38 TEC polymorphisms was performed in a total of 592 subjects, including 163 AERD cases and 429 ATA controls. Genotyping was carried out with 20 ng of genomic DNA by TaqMan assay using ABI prism 7900HT sequence detection system software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) in all subjects. Assay IDs of all SNPs used in TaqMan assay are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
