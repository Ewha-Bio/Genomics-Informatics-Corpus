Analysis of metabolic pathways
The pathway analysis was conducted to screen out the putative drug targets and their involvement in important and unique pathways of the pathogen B. petrii which are essential for the survival of the pathogen. The preliminary search in KEGG database suggested for involvement of 22 proteins in different important pathways of B. petrii, and therefore the dataset of putative drug target reduced from 26 to 22. Further, exploration of all available pathways for both human and pathogen was conducted and compared, resulted 38 unique pathways present in B. petrii but absent in human. Furthermore, the comparison was made between the identified important pathways of B. petrii for 22 drug targets and 38 unique pathways identified in B. petrii, resulted 12 putative drug targets (Table 1) contributing towards the 3 common and unique pathways of B. petrii namely, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, two component system, and bacterial chemotaxis. As per literature suggest, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis is an essential pathway [44] for the survival of B. petrii, a major component of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and referred as endotoxin. It is comprised of a hydrophilic polysaccharide and a hydrophobic component referred as lipid A which is responsible for major bio reactivity of endotoxin [44], also serves as a physical barrier providing protection towards bacteria from its surroundings [45]. Intense inspection on lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 3) suggested, out of 12 selected putative drug targets (Table 1) only eight numbers (lpxH, kdsB, lpxK, lpxD, lpxB, kdsA, lpxC, and Bpet0453) were as key regulatory proteins [46]. Again, involvement of two components namely, amino acid and sugar metabolism and pentose phosphate pathway were found as regulating the complete pathway. lpxC, lpxD, lpxH, lpxB, and lpxK proteins are involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism, and among them lpxH was discarded as the synthesis of lpxB could alternatively possible by lpxD. Further, lpxB and lpxK were also rejected as potential drug target as the regulation of kdtA and waaA through lpxB and lpxK were otherwise possible by the proteins involved in pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, Bpet0453 (5.3.1.13), kdsA (2.5.1.55), and kdsB (2.7.7.38) proteins were found as key proteins of pentose phosphate metabolism components (Fig. 3), and regulating synthesis of kdtA and waaA, but the synthesis of same proteins was also control by proteins involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism to carried out the whole lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. So the key proteins kdsA, kdsB, and Bpet0453 of pentose phosphate pathway were discarded. Finally, two proteins namely lpxD and lpxC were selected on the basis of their highly involvement in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathway than any other proteins (Figs. 2B and 3).
