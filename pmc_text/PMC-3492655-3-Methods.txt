Pre-processing SNP array data
Before CNV calling procedures, all required pre-processing procedures, including allele correction, summarization, and background correction, were performed as described previously by using the software provided by Affymetrix [5]. In brief, background-corrected data were normalized using quantile normalization and summarized by median polish.
