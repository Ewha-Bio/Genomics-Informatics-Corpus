Both knockdown of nc886 and introduction of dsRNA activate PKR (Fig. 3). nc886 silencing does occur during tumorigenesis and dsRNA is generated during viral infection. The significance of PKR in viral infection is to sense viruses and remove them by inducing apoptosis through eIF2α phosphorylation. We implanted this scenario in cancer and proposed a tumor surveillance model. In this model, nc886 silencing in pre-malignant cells is sensed by PKR, which eliminates them through eIF2α phosphorylation. Another important point in this model is the escape of viruses or cancer cells from the PKR:eIF2α cell death pathway. Viruses have various strategies to bypass or disarm PKR. Likewise, some potential cancer cells can survive the PKR surveillance through genetic or epigenetic alterations. For an elaborate description on the tumor surveillance model, please read this review [25].
