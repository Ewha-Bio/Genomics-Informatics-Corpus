Power test of IVW, SZ_SE, and SZ_N. Total 100,000 simulated meta-analysis data sets of five studies were generated, each with 500 case and 500 control. (A) We assumed the same MAFs of 0.3 for five studies. (B) We assumed varying MAFs of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 for five studies. IVW, inverse variance-weighted average method; SZ_SE, weighted SZ whose weights are given as inverse standard error; SZ_N, SZ whose weights are given as the square root of sample size; MAF, minor allele frequency.
