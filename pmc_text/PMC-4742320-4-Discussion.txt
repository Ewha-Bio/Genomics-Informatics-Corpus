The existence of introns in genome is a real mystery, given the expensive energy cost for a cell to pay for copying the entire length of several introns in a gene and excising them at the exact position, controlled by big RNA and protein complexes after transcription. Nevertheless, most completely genomes of eukaryotic cells so far carry introns in their genomes [6970], and some studies even showed that introns had been propagated during eukaryotic lineage evolution [39717273]. The origin of spliceosomal introns in eukaryotic lineage has been attempted to be explained by the massive invasion of group II self-splicing introns from bacteria to eukaryotes [35]. It is very hard to understand how and why introns propagate in eukaryotic lineages and what the beneficial effect of introns on cell survival is.
We reviewed here putative functional roles of introns in various cellular processes such as splicing, mRNA transport, NMD, and expression regulation. Besides, introns may give some advantages as a mutational buffer in eukaryotic genomes protecting coding sequences from being affected by randomly occurring deleterious mutations. Introns occupy about 40% on average of the total length of genes, which means that most randomly occurring mutations will fall into intron regions, and do not affect protein sequences and functions. However, it is not clear how extensively and strongly this buffering effect of intron regions might have evolutionary advantages for intron retention against the pressure of removing cellular burdens.
Taken together, introns are clearly not junk, and they provide selective advantages to cells to be evolutionarily maintained, nevertheless, it has expensive energetic costs. New advanced molecular biology techniques will lead to the functional territories of introns in a more detailed scale in the near future.
