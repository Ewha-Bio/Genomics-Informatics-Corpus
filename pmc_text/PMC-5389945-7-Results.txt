Evaluation of SNP detection in genomic DNA by three dPCR instruments
Prior to using dPCR to detect donor DNA in transplant patient cfDNA samples, we tested the performance of three different dPCR instruments (Bio-Rad QX200, RainDance RainDrop, and Life Technologies QuantStudio 3D) using control genomic DNA samples with three different genotypes of a SNP (rs543840) (sample 1, AA; sample 2, AG; sample 3, GG) (Fig. 1). The Bio-Rad QX200 system had the highest counts and best genotype clustering in all samples. The RainDrop system had a high false-positive rate in the homozygous samples (sample 1, 1.19%; sample 3, 17.75%), and an unequal allelic ratio (A:G = 1:3) in the heterozygous sample (sample 2). The QuantStudio 3D system gave clear clustering in the heterozygous sample (sample 2) but gave weak clustering (sample 1) and high false positive counts (sample 3) in the homozygous samples. Therefore, among the three dPCR systems tested in this study, the Bio-Rad QX200 system had the best performance in detecting SNPs in control genomic DNA samples. The Bio-Rad QX200 dPCR system was thus chosen for dPCR screening of transplant patient cfDNA samples.
