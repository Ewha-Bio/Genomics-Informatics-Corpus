Genotyped and imputed data
The genomic DNAs were isolated from snivel by using the nasal collection kit and were genotyped with 54,609 SNPs on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. We excluded the SNPs with a missingness rate of 0.05, minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.01, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test p-value 10-6 using PLINK [8]. Then, we removed SNPs on the sex chromosome and retained 41,099 autosomal SNPs for further analysis. After this quality control, 462 Holstein genomic data had been imputed using BEAGLE [9].
