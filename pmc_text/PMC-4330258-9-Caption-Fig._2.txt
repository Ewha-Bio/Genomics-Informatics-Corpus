Chromosome plot for platelet counts. Genome-wide association study for log-transformed platelet count on a population-based sample of 8,842 individuals from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) study. The x axis represents the genomic position (in Gb) of 352,225 single nucleotide polymorphisms; they show -log10(p-value). Single nucleotide polymorphisms with a p-value < 1 Ã— 10-4 are highlighted in red.
