Collection of datasets
We have collected and generated genomics data obtained from 1,304 Korean cancer patients collaborating with a number of hospitals in Korea, such as Seoul National University Hospital (liver), Chungbuk National University Hospital (bladder), Chonbuk National University Hospital (liver, bile duct, and colon), Yonsei University Severance Hospital (breast), Korea University Medical Center (stomach), and Kosin University Gospel Hospital (stomach). The data were partially deposited to and freely available from the Gene Expression Omnibus of National Center for Biotechnology Information. All datasets stored in the database were normalized using quantile normalization. Detailed repository status was illustrated in Supplementary Table 1.
