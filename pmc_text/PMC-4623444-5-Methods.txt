Construction of regulatory networks based on expression value
With TFs searched by iRegulon, we tried to construct regulatory network modules which can explain situation of expressions of target genes based on expression level. This construction was carried out using Genomica [12], which is an analysis and visualization tool for genomic data. Among functions of Genomica, we used the "Create a Module Network." It identifies regulatory network modules from gene expression data based on probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian networks. The options "Max number of modules" and "Min experiments per context" were set at 4.
