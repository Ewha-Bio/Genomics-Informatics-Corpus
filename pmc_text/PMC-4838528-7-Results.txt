Analysis of markers of chromosome abnormality syndromes
We next analyzed whether the observed discrepancy between methylation patterns of gender-specific genes and the given clinical information could be explained by rare sex chromosome abnormality syndromes, such as Turner and Klinefelter syndromes.
While a normal male inherits an X chromosome and a Y chromosome and a normal female inherits two X chromosomes, several abnormalities in the number of sex chromosomes occur gender-specifically. For females, abnormalities are a result of variations in the number of X chromosomes. For males, abnormalities are due to irregular numbers of the X or Y chromosome or both. The most frequent sex chromosome abnormalities in females are Turner (one X; 1:2,000) and triple X (XXX; 1:1,000), while those in males are Klinefelter (XXY; 1:500) and XYY (1:1,000) syndromes [12131415].
For comparison, we collected Infinium 450K Human-Methylation array data of one Turner syndrome patient and five Klinefelter syndrome patients. The characteristic methylation pattern of Turner syndrome (one X) is the hypomethylation of both X- and Y-specific markers (Fig. 3A). However, we found that most discordant-female samples in our dataset showed hypermethylation patterns in Y-specific markers, suggesting that they had XY chromosomes (a normal male) but not X (Turner syndrome) chromosome (Fig. 3A). Only one discordant-female sample (green circle in Fig. 2A) showed a pattern similar to Turner syndrome. For Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), the expected methylation patterns are the hypermethylation of both male- and female-specific markers. We observed one discordant-male sample in which both male- and female-specific markers were hypermethylated (red circles in Figs. 2B and 3A). However, a close examination of three Klinefelter syndrome-specific markers revealed that the one discordant-male sample did not show the patterns of a Klinefelter syndrome patient (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 4) [16]. In conclusion, only one sample showed a methylation pattern associated with sex chromosome abnormalities.
