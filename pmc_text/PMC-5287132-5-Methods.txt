Elimination of human homologous proteins of F. nucleatum
Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTP) analysis (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was carried out for the Set1 proteome against the proteome of Homo sapiens. Proteins with an E-value (expectation value) 10â€“4 were eliminated; assuming that they have a certain level of homology with the host genome [21]. The resultant data set (Set2 proteome) of F. nucleatum had no homology with the human proteome.
