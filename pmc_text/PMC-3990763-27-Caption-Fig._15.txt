The genetic property of high-risk patients. For the very high-risk patients, the genetic property of patient ALL302 (the only survivor at the bottom-right) is significantly different from the others (at the top-left). Further examination using the 250 genes of interest confirms this hypothesis for the expression values, especially for the genes ABHD10, LEPREL1, CNOT4, CHD9, EPOR, RASAL2, ZNF141, and SLC25A31.
