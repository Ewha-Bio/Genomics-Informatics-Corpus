ppub of RefSeq viral genomes
First, RefSeq raw data was collected from GenBank database in NCBI. As we know very well, NCBI provides GenBank files which include meta information and gene sequence information for each organism. However, the general GenBank files have problems that the information is duplicated because the same sequence information is submitted to NCBI by several institutes. This causes the increase of computation consumption. Thus, NCBI provides RefSeq GenBank files that minimized the sequence redundancy [4]. Thus, RefSeq data is appropriable to be used by reference sequences or standard sequences at executing a sequence alignment. In this study, the viruses data that are named by ICTV are only extracted from RefSeq genome sequences in NCBI database and then utilized in this study. The viral RefSeq sequences were parsed by the accession number starting with “NC_” notification implying the complete genome sequence. The information of viral RefSeq sequences can obtain from “viral 1.1” and “viral 2.1” (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/). There are norovirus species of 6 types: GI (NC_001959.2), GII (NC_029646.1), GIII (NC_029645.1), GIV (NC_0296471), GV (NC_008311.1), and primate norovirus (NC_031324.1).
