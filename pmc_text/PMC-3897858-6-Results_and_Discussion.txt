As shown in Fig. 1, adenosine and caffeine, a typical agonist and antagonist of AdoRs, respectively, share the structure of purine. However, the Tanimoto coefficient between the two ligands is not high. The Tanimoto coefficient of some agonists to adenosine was lower than 0.3, though they did not take a large share. Moreover, the lowest Tanimoto coefficient of the agonists was 0.12766 (capadenoson) and is a lower value as an antagonist.
The results of hierarchical clustering of the similarity matrices from the MACCS keys, PubChem, and Klekota-Roth fingerprints; EVA; and CIMVF are shown in Fig. 2.
The dendrograms obtained from MACCS keys and PubChem fingerprint were shown to be similar to the Tanimoto coefficient pattern. The result of the Klekota-Roth fingerprint analysis showed a somewhat different pattern to the fingerprint-based one, as only two antagonists were located in the cluster of agonists. However, the three fingerprint-based results did not match the known facts of AdoR agonism.
In the case of EVA, Takane and Mitchell [27] reported a structure-odor relationship using the EVA descriptor and hierarchical clustering. The authors reported that the dendrograms that were produced by the EVA method outperformed those from UNITY 2D in a classification of odorant molecules. However, the EVA analysis in the current study was positive but not perfect for the molecular property-activity relationship in AdoR agonism. The larger Ïƒ got, the more the clusters in the dendrogram got entangled (data not shown). It might come from the Gaussian function that smeared out the vibrational frequencies, such that vibrations of similar frequency overlapped together. The dendrogram obtained from the EVA descriptor showed an eligible tree for the agonism of AdoRs on the whole (Fig. 2D). One exception in which an antagonist (ZM241385) was clustered in a subtree of agonists might have resulted from smoothing by the Gaussian convolution of molecular vibration data.
All antagonists were clustered into a subtree in the dendrogram obtained from CIMVF analysis, as shown in Fig. 2E. We can tell the regional difference between agonists and antagonists in the dendrogram and also find that the information from the CIMVF analysis can play a role in the discrimination of agonists from antagonists in AdoR agonism. The discreteness of CIMVF data seems to facilitate the performance of the binary classification of AdoR ligands.
To find the topological difference between dendrograms, similarity scores between every two dendrograms were shown in Table 2. The similarity between two dendrograms was represented as a percentage. For example, the score of topological similarity between the two dendrograms of CIMVF and EVA analyses is 59.6%. The value has the highest similarity among all comparisons. A distance meta-tree build from five dendrograms of 46 AdoR ligands was illustrated in Fig. 3. As shown in the tree, the resulting dendrogram produced from the CIMVF data analysis has the nearest position to that produced from the EVA data analysis and is located the farthest from the dendrogram produced from the analysis of MACCS keys.
It is generally known that structurally similar molecules have similar properties or functions; however, a small change in molecular structure can fairly affect its vibrational frequencies. The structural variety of AdoR ligands was shown in Fig. 4. The Tanimoto coefficients of LUF5835, BAY60-6583, and capadenoson to adenosine were smaller than 0.18, and the ligands share a hydroxyphenyl pyridine dicarbonitrile backbone (Fig. 4A). They seem to be dissimilar to other agonists that share the structure of purine. Several antagonists (Fig. 4B) do not have a similar structure to caffeine; however, they act as antagonists of AdoRs.
As mentioned above, the current experiment does provide circumstantial evidence for the molecular vibrational information to AdoR agonism, at least. With a more concentrated study on the relationship between the molecular vibrational frequency and pharmacological function of a ligand, the vibrational spectrum of a ligand molecule may explicitly propose a novel path to the field of receptor-ligand interaction mechanisms.
