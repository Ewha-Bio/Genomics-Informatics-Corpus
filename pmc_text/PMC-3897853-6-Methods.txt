Cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement
Cells were fixed with 75% cold ethanol and stained with a solution containing propidium iodide and RNase A (Sigma). For ROS measurement, cells were stained with 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), and the fluorescence of 10,000 cells was measured by flow cytometry.
