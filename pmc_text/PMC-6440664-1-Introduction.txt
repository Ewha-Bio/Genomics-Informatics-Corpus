MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded, non-coding small RNAs, whose sizes range from 18 to 25 nucleotides [1]. They play indispensable roles in regulating gene or protein expression by enhancing mRNA degradation or translational repression. It has been estimated that miRNAs control up to 60% of protein-coding genes in the human genome at the translational level [1]. Critical regulatory roles of miRNAs in complex cellular and physiological pathways have been extensively studied in various scientific fields. Examples of these roles include but are not limited to: differentiation, proliferation, migration, adhesion, apoptosis, hematopoiesis, and immune development and functional differentiation [2]. As they are involved in a variety of crucial regulatory functions, any abnormal expression and functions of miRNAs are predicted to have a profound impact on target molecules. For this reason, miRNA dysregulation has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune conditions. In this review, miRNAs in autoimmune diseases will be discussed with a special emphasis on autoimmune Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS). Translating the discovery of unique expression patterns and functions of miRNAs in SjS into clinical practice is expected to improve current diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.
