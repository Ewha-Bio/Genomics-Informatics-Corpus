SNP genotypes
The genotypes were obtained using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The genotype quality control criteria have been reported in a previous genome-wide association study [7]. Briefly, every 500 ng of genomic DNA was genotyped on the Affy 5.0, and the Bayesian robust linear genotyping algorithm using Mahalanobis distance was used for genotype calling [8]. Samples with a high missing genotype call rate (â‰¥4%), high heterozygosity (>30%), inconsistency in sex, and any tumor were excluded from subsequent analyses.
