Docking and post-docking simulation
Normally, in FASN-catalyzed lipid biosynthesis, seven cycles of two carbon additions are essential for synthesizing the 16-carbon palmitate. The respective initial physiological substrates for the KR and ER domains-namely, β-ketobutyryl and trans butenoyl groups-were built using 2D draw. Further, these structures were optimized using LigPrep 2.6 (Schrödinger, LLC) and docked to the respective catalytic active sites using Glide 5.8 (Schrödinger, LLC) (Figs. 8 and 9). Reports suggest that in these β-carbon processing enzymes, KR and ER have been studied using derivatives of S-β-ketobutyryl and S-crotonyl (S-acyl-N-acetyl cysteamine thioester derivatives) as model substrates [3, 31]. The Glide docking score for the ER trans butenoyl complex was found to be -2.283 kcal/mol with a Glide energy of -11.638 kcal/mol. Similarly, the Glide docking score for the KR domain was found to be -5.25738 kcal/mol with a Glide energy of -16.827 kcal/mol.
Finally, both docked complexes were validated for the stability of complex formation, implementing a MD simulation using DESMOND. The simulations for both holoenzyme complexes were carried out for 5 ns. The RMSD plot for all atoms of each holoenzyme during the production run was analyzed. The plots showed no significant increase in deviation until the completion of 5 ns (Figs. 5A and 6A). Similarly, the radius of gyration was also calculated for the complex structures, which inferred the compactness of the docked complexes, as it was within the range of 1 Å in the case of both complexes.
Hence, all of these findings strongly suggest the highly stable complex formation of the ER and KR domains with their respective substrates (Figs. 5B and 6B). The root mean square fluctuation plot of all residues on pre-substrate binding and post-substrate binding (Fig. 10A and 10B) clearly indicates the decrease in overall flexibility of the residues in the holo condition of both the ER and KR domains.
