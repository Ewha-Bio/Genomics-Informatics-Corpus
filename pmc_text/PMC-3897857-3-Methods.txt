NanoString experiment
To validate the mRNA candidates as body fluid specific markers, NanoString technology was employed. Color-coded barcodes that represented a single target mRNA were synthesized, targeting 18 body fluid-specific mRNA markers, and 2 endogenous controls for mRNA. Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA was hybridized to the barcode, and then probe-mRNA complexes were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated cartridge according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, the cartridges were placed in the digital analyzer, and barcodes were counted. All the counts were normalized by the count of GAPDH barcodes.
