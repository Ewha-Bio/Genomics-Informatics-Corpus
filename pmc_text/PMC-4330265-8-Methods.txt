Evaluation and validation of the model
The accuracy and stereo chemical quality of the predicted model were evaluated with PROCHECK [16, 17] by Ramachandran plot [18] analysis, which was done through "Protein structure and model assessment tools" of Swissmodel workspace; 2.5 Ã… resolution was selected for PROCHECK analysis. The best model was selected on the basis of overall G-factor, number of residues in the core, and allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions. ERRAT [19], Verify3D [20], and Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN) [21] were used for further analysis of the selected model. The verified structure was visualized by Swiss-PDB Viewer [22].
