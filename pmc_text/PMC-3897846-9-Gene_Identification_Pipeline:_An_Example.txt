Disease gene prioritization
- Variant annotation. VCF files are converted to genome variation format (GVF) format using the VAAST vaast_converter tool. The variants are then annotated using the VAAST VAT tool.
- Variant selection. The annotated variants are selected and condensed to condenser (CDR) format using the VAAST VST tool for cases and controls, respectively.
- Gene prioritization. VAAST is used to perform disease gene ranking and output a text file containing a list of ranked candidate genes.
