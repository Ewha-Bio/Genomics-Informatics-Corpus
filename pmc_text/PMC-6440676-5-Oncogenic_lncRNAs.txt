Glioblastoma
Glioma, which is present in more than 30% of brain cancer patients, is one of the cancers with the poorest prognosis [39]. Despite the advancements in technology and therapeutic approaches for glioma treatment, its prognosis is poor and recurrence of glioma progression might be unavoidable [40]. Gliomas are sub-divided into grades II–IV with glioblastomas (GBM), with the highest grade, having a high risk of invasion and recurrence [41, 42]. Despite many studies investigating strategies for surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy of GBM, the survival period for patients with GBM is short [43]. The lncRNAs that have been associated with GBM include NEAT1, DANCR, lncHERG, SNHG7, MNX1-AS1, MCM3AP-AS1, and LINC01446 (Table 3).
The expression of nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is higher in GBM cells than in normal brain cells. NEAT1 act as a sponge of miR-449b-5p, leading to downregulation of the miRNA expression [44]. Consequently, the expression of c-Met, which has a tumorigenic role and is a molecular target of miR-449b-5p, is increased. Another study has presented that NEAT1 can also act as a ceRNA for miR-132 inhibition, which lead to increase of oncogene SOX2 expression and subsequent induction of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in glioma cells [45]. The oncogenic roles of NEAT1 could be supported by the bioinformatics analyses based on the Oncomine database demonstrating that NEAT1 expression was significantly upregulated in GBM (5.286- and 4.887-fold change) compared to the corresponding normal brain tissues (Fig. 5) [46, 47].
Differentiation antagonizing non-protein coding RNA (DANCR) is another oncogenic lncRNA present in GBM cells. DANCR is reported to inhibit several tumor-suppressive miRNAs including miR-33b-5p, miR-1-3p, miR-206, and miR-613 by functioning as a ceRNA [48]. Inhibition of these miRs by DANCR is associated with activation of AXL/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling. Another study has demonstrated that DANCR can activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling although further study for identification of potential DANCR targets on Wnt/β-catenin signaling would be required [49]. These effects of DANCR is responsible for cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, and cell migration functions, and, as a consequence, contributes to chemoresistance in GBM therapy.
