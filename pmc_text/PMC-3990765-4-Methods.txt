Analysis of CNPs
SNP genotyping arrays recently have been used for CNP detection and analysis, because the arrays can serve dual roles for SNP- and CNV-based association studies. To detect CNP markers from the SNPs, we used the Affymetrix Genotyping Analysis Software and Copy Number Analysis Tool (CNAT version 3.0), which was downloaded from the Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/products/software). We calculated the distribution of genomic smoothing copy number signal intensity (upper-boundary = 2.78, lower-boundary = 1.51) to detect the CNPs (Supplementary Fig. 1). We regarded markers with values beyond the upper- and lower-boundary values as CNVs. Then, we selected the CNPs that presented variation in >1% of the individuals as CNVs that occurred in more than 1% of the population [14]. We downloaded the detection tools from the website (http://www.affymetrix.com/products/software) and used these programs for our Pan-Asian SNP data. We regarded markers with values outside of the upper- and lower-boundary values as CNVs. Then, we selected CNPs which presented variation in >1% of the 1,196 individuals.
