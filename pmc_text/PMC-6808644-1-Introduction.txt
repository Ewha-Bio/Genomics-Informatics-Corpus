Fusion genes are important class of biomarkers in cancer studies. Numerous fusion genes have been established as cancer drivers including BCR-ABL1 fusion in chronic myelogenous leukemia [1], TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in prostate cancer [2], EML4-ALK and CD74-NRG1 fusions in non-small cell lung cancer [3,4], and FGFR3-TACC3 in glioblastoma [5] and bladder cancer [6].
A number of algorithms and programs have been already published for fusion detection problem from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Basic idea is to identify the split reads and discordant read pairs that map to two distinct genes. Subsequently, the exact fusion point is determined from the split reads where single mate reads overlap the fusion junction, with the fusion-encompassing reads used as supporting evidence. Early approaches following this scheme include FusionSeq [7], ChimeraScan [8], deFuse [9], FusionMap [10], TopHat-Fusion [11], and FusionHunter [12], as extensively reviewed by Wang et al. [13].
However, their performance varies dramatically in terms of precision, sensitivity (recall), and computational costs according to the mapping methods, filtering strategies, and parameter optimization. According to recent comparison where the performance of these tools was evaluated using synthetic and experimental datasets, no program showed satisfactory performance [14]. Programs with high sensitivity (ChimeraScan and TopHat-Fusion) predicted thousands of false-positives. Programs with low sensitivity (FusionMap, FusionHunter, and deFuse) still produced tens to hundreds of false-positives, unacceptable number for experimental confirmation, and had very limited overlap in the results.
Recent programs improved the performance by implementing diverse ideas. FusionQ used the concept of residual mapping to extend the short reads [15]. Similarly, BreakFusion combined the targeted assembly procedure to overcome the limits owing to short read length [16]. EricScript [17] improved the mapping accuracy by building exon junction reference and recalibration using BLAT [18]. Nevertheless, no programs achieved the accuracy over 50% of sensitivity and specificity simultaneously for the experimental datasets. Two programs are notable exceptions even though they have not been tested on public datasets. SOAPfuse used a library of fusion junction sequences by partial exhaustion algorithm and a series of filters to enhance confidence [19]. Analyzing two bladder cancer cell lines, they confirmed 15 cases out of 16 predictions, whereas deFuse identified 11 fusions of which 10 were confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments. SOAPfusion implemented a novel masking and aligning procedure to achieve better sensitivity and false discovery rate than deFuse in the simulation test [20], but it needs further objective evaluation.
In this article, we report a novel algorithm FusionScan that implemented various strategies to enhance both the sensitivity and precision. We have compared the performance with other widely used programs using both experimental and simulated datasets. Our analysis demonstrated that careful mapping and extensive filtering processes were essential for good performance.
