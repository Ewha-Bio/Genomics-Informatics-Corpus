Dendrograms of clustering using fingerprints, EigenVAlue (EVA), and corralled intensity of molecular vibrational frequency (CIMVF) by complete linkage method. Antagonists were tagged with "t_" to their chemical names as a prefix. (A) MACCS keys. Agonists with low Tanimoto coefficient to adenosine were clustered to a subtree of antagonists. (B) PubChem fingerprint. The clustering result of the PubChem fingerprint was similar to that of MACCS clustering. (C) Klekota-Roth fingerprint. Some antagonists were located in a subtree of agonists. (D) EVA. About half of the antagonists were located in the cluster of agonists. An antagonist, ZM241385, was clustered in the agonist subtree. (E) CIMVF. All agonists and antagonists were categorized to each cluster.
