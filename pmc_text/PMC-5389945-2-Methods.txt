Patients
As a pilot test, genomic DNA and cfDNA were isolated from three different pairs of donor and recipient samples (blood, plasma, and urine) collected at Asan Medical Center. For clinical sample screening using SNP-based dPCR, the blood (n = 72), plasma (n = 72), and urine (n = 69) samples were collected from a total of 34 kidney transplant recipients with different clinical conditions at Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Patient were stable, or experiencing acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity, or suffering from non-specific injury. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center and Kyung Hee University Hospital at Gangdong. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
