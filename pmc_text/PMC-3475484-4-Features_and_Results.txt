Database and viewer
Our web-based database viewer can display previously discovered CNVs by their positions (Fig. 2). Users can also filter out CNVs based on the DGV overlapped regions, CNV type (Gain/Loss/Complex), or their frequencies. Each selected region could be diagnosed in detail by clicking on it. DGV and OMIM ID columns are linked with corresponding websites, and CNVR position columns are linked with the genome browser. The genome browser is integrated based on the open source project GBrowse2. Users can seek or zoom in/out of CNVs across the chromosome by entering positions or clicking zoom buttons. GBrowse2 can also display interesting areas by dragging the region bar without reloading the entire page. Gene information of the selected area is also displayed, and details will be given on separate pop-up page by clicking on it.
