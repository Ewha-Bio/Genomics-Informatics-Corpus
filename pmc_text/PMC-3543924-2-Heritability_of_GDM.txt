GDM is thought to have strong heritability. GDM women have an increased positive family history of T2DM. Compared to pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, GDM women have a significantly greater parental history of T2DM (13.2% vs. 30.1%, p < 0.001) [10]. In addition, both GDM women and their offspring are at increased risk of future development of T2DM. The heritability estimate of T2DM was reported to be quite high (h2 = 0.69) in a recent study performed in Europeans [11]. These findings are indirect evidence that GDM has familial tendency. However, there is no study that has specifically evaluated the heritability of GDM using familial clustering or twins [12]. It would be important to estimate the heritability of GDM and compare it with that of T2DM in women.
