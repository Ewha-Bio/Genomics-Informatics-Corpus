Performance comparison between model A and model B
Via the area under the ROC curve (AUC), we compared the performance of model A and model B obtained with NB. Model B (AUC = 0.69), for which the input factors were the SNP information in addition to the factors used in model A, showed better performance than model A (AUC = 0.65), for which the input factors were age, sex, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption status, and exercise status.
