Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, most commonly caused by a viral infection [1]. Five main hepatitis viruses are known, referred to as types A, B, C, D, and E. We are concerned with these main types because of the burden of illness and death; they also have the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and together constitute the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer [1]. The Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service [2] reported on C type hepatitis patients in Korea, described in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the number of patients has been increased steadily. The prevalence rate of hepatitis type C in Koreans is 1%-1.5%. From the prevalence rate, 500,000-600,000 patients are estimated. Only 10% of them are treated. If we find risk factors for hepatitis, it is helpful for the prevention and treatment of hepatitis.
In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study of hepatitis in Korean populations. We tried to find significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and epidemiological traits related to hepatitis.
