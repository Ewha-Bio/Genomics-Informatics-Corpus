Construction of the haplotype blocks
After phasing heterozygous SNPs using Samtools, we searched for phased haplotypes that harbored significant risk alleles for BMI from the GWA analysis results. We found 44 haplotype blocks in 23 of 53 LD blocks. We could not find haplotypes with significant risk alleles in the rest of the LD blocks. We ordered 44 haplotypes and established a catalog for possible haplotype blocks associated with BMI variations in the Korean population (Table 2). For example, AK4 and AK7 share the TCTGAGCC haplotype, which comprises the variants at bps 246142250, 246142279, 246144436, 246146137, 246146178, 246146444, 246148791, and 246149166 in chromosome 1. Bp 57895600 in chromosome 18 has been previously known as rs8089366 (G/T) in the dbSNP database and was a significant SNP for BMI in KARE. On the other hand, bp 57900630, which participated in the same haplotype, has not been registered in the dbSNP database. In Table 2, 16 LD blocks were shared by several individuals, while the rest of the LD blocks were carried by single individuals.
