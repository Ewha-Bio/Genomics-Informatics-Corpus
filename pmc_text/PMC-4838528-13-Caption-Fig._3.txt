Comparison of methylation status between normal and sex chromosome abnormalities. (A) Scatterplot of methylation status of gender-specific methylation markers on X and Y chromosomes. The red circle indicates the sample with suspected Klinefelter syndrome. The green circle indicates the sample with suspected Turner syndrome. (B) Box plot of Klinefelter syndrome-specific methylation markers of normal males, normal females, a sample with suspected Klinefelter syndrome, and Klinefelter syndrome samples. M, male; F, female; M_dis, male samples showing methylation patterns of females; F_dis, female samples showing methylation patterns of males; T, Turner syndrome sample; KS, Klinefelter syndrome sample; KS_sus, Klinefelter syndrome-suspected sample.
