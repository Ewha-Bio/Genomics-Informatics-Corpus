Integrated replication dynamic related with CNV instability
In the study of Koren et al. [75], point mutations and CNVs showed different patterns in their correlations with replication timing. These observations may reflect the distinct mutational mechanisms between these two types of genomic variants and suggest complex effects of DNA replication on CNV instability. We hypothesized that integrated replication dynamics, which are not just early/late replication timing, contribute to CNV mutation. It has been reported that dividing the genome into early/late replication timing alone does not give the entire characteristics of DNA replication fork dynamics [72]. Actually, the timing transitional regions represent the interactions of two spatially dependent chromatin compartments, which are DNA segments with low rates of replication fork progression. Notably, slower fork speed and increased fork stalling have been found to be associated with cancer cells and result in CNV mutations [94]. Actually, Chen et al. [95] have conducted a statistical method, estimating replication dynamics, and observed its significant association with CNV instability. Replication dynamics may be used as a measure of the progress of genome replication and regional replication stress and provides novel insights into the roles of DNA replication in CNV mutagenesis.
