Selective sweeps in modern humans
There are 212 positively selected regions identified in modern humans that occurred early during the history in conjunction with or shortly after their divergence from Neanderthals. The largest of the positively selected regions contains the gene THADA, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of which have been linked with type II diabetes [52]. This change may have affected the energy metabolism of early modern humans. A number of other genes that lie on these selectively swept regions have been associated with other genetic disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and Down syndrome. Since both autism and schizophrenia are related to cognitive development, it could be assumed that multiple genes involved in cognitive development in humans were positively selected early in the history of modern humans.
