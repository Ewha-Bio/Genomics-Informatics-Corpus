A mechanistic understanding of spatio-temporal gene expression in eukaryotes is far from complete. While genetic differences might be expected to explain expression divergence across species and expression variability across individuals of a population, it cannot explain how almost-identical genomes in more than 200 different cell types within an individual organism can drive such varied expression profiles specific to each cell type [4]. DNA is packaged in a nucleoprotein complex structure called chromatin that is highly dynamic, in that its "states" vary from one cell type to another. Therefore, a possible solution to this conundrum is to analyze these "states" at the genome level, i.e., characterize the landscape of the epigenome, which further qualifies and modulates the functional effect of genetic information [5]. Epigenome, meaning "on or above genomes," refers to such sequence-independent heritable properties of the genome that can modulate the functional output of the genome. While, as described initially, heritability is an important qualifying criterion of an epigenomic mark (most notably, DNA methylation) [6], currently, the term epigenome is loosely used to encompass a myriad of chemical changes to DNA or histone proteins, chromatin accessibility, small and long (non-coding) RNA localization, and higher-order DNA organization (including nucleosome occupancy and positioning, and 3D chromatin interactions) (Fig. 1) [7,8,9]. The ultimate combined effect of the epigenome is to determine the transcriptome (the set of all transcripts) of a cell precisely. Epigenomic features influence the regulatory program of each gene's expression in several ways: they define the local environment of specific processes by regulating the chromatin architecture, determine access of transcription factors to DNA, as well as serve to keep a "memory" of cell type-specific features facilitating heritability of epigenetic characteristics [10, 11].
