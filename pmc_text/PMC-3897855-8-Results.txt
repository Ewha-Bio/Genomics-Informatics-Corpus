Distribution of genotypes and alleles of KLF5 gene
The recruited 62 children were aged 11.51 ± 0.97 y, and girls made up more than half of the children recruited (n = 33, 53.2%). Mean BMI estimated from height and weight was 20.26 ± 3.41 kg/m2. The average BMR was 1,018.42 ± 113.86 kcal/day, and muscle averaged 28.26 ± 4.99 kg (data not shown). Children with the C allele were nearly twice those with the T allele in each group. In the overweight group, allele frequencies were 67.6% for C allele and 32.4% for T allele. However, we found no statistical significance between the frequencies of alleles and genotypes in two groups (Table 1). On the other hand, four children had TT genotype in the high-BMR group and only one child had TT genotype in the low-BMR group. Thus, four in five children with the TT genotype belong to the high-BMR group. However, there were no differences of alleles and genotypes in the low- and high-BMR groups (Table 1).
