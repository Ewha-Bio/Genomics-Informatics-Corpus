Sanger sequencing
To confirm the 25 loci, we tried to amplify them using PCR analysis. However, only six loci were successfully amplified in two samples (cases Nos. 1 and 5), due to severe DNA damage in the FFPE samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). We conducted Sanger sequencing of the PCR products. Only one out of the six loci was authentic; one sample (case No. 5) contained a missense mutation (c.3592A>T, p.M1198L) in the BCR gene (Supplementary Fig. 6).
