Statistical analyses
Multivariate linear regressions, adjusted for the effects of age and body mass index (BMI, weight/height2, kg/m2) [23] via an additive model, were used to further investigate the influence of SNPs on BMD. Genome-wide association patterns were analyzed by the PLINK software package version 1.07 [20], while quantile-quantile and Manhattan plots were obtained by R software 3.2.2 (2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Regional association plots of the significant SNPs were generated by LocusZoom software [24]. All results with p < 1 Ã— 10-6 were considered statistically significant.
