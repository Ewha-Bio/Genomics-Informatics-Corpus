Gene marker selection
After applying a 20% zero proportion threshold for filtration, a total of 42,747 genes were selected. For ease of interpretation, only protein-coding genes and microRNA genes, which numbered up to 18,415 genes, were used. We performed two pre-screening processes. The first one used MAD.
Genes with MAD under the 10% quantile were filtered out to control false positives. The second filtering was performed using p-values of the gene markers. After that, genes with p-values larger than 0.3 were removed. After the prescreening, 6,161 genes remained. We then fit the modified penalized Cox regression model as explained in the Methods section. Among the many values, 0.2 was chosen as the gamma parameter to be effective for both marker selection and prediction in this study. Finally, three genes—REN, LEFTY1, and AP1S2—were selected, along with 6 clinical variables. These selected markers are summarized in Table 3.
