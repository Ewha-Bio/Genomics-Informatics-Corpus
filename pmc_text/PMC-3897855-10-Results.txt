Risk factors related to BMR
The parametric Pearson correlation analysis of the data revealed that BMR was significantly positively correlated with height (r = 0.888, p < 0.001), weight (r = 0.873, p < 0.001), BMI (r = 0.669, p < 0.001), fat mass (r = 0.596, p < 0.001), muscle (r = 1.000, p < 0.001), insulin (r = 0.377, p = 0.002), and C-peptide (r = 0.618, p < 0.001) (data not shown). Because the value of BMR and RMR was similar to each other, we analyzed the regression equation of BMR with the contributors. Linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative contributions of BMI, muscle, fat mass, insulin, and cholesterol to the inter-individual variations of BMR. In the linear regression analysis, BMI and muscle mass were correlated with BMR in every genotype of KLF5, whereas insulin and C-peptide were not associated with BMR in children with the CT and TT compared to CC genotype. It was interesting that TC was negatively correlated with BMR in only the TT genotype in contrast to the CC or CT genotype. (Figs. 1 and 2). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative contribution of age, muscle, RI, tricep, glucose, and insulin to BMR in children. We identified that age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, and fat mass could explain 100% of BMR (adjusted r2 = 1.000, p < 0.001) in children (Table 4). In the high-BMR group, we observed that higher muscle, fat mass, and C-peptide affected the increase of BMR in children with TT genotype (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.018, respectively), while RI could explain the usual decrease in BMR (adjusted r2 = 1.000, p < 0.001). Our prediction equation of BMR including age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, and fat mass specific for children from 10 to 13 years old is as follows: BMR = 369.634+(1.038 × age) + (22.452 × muscle) - (0.087 × RI)+ (0.090 × tricep) + (11.147 × WHR) + (0.532 × fat mass).
