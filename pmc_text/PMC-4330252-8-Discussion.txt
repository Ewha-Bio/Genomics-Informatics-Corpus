In this paper, we carried out a genomewide epistasis analysis to understand the comprehensive genetic relationships between DM, HT, and CAD in a Korean cohort. For systematic annotation, we employed whole-genome multiple-cell-type enhancer data, because the majority of detected epistatic SNPs was located in non-coding regions. Our enrichment analysis in regulatory DNA regions identified substantial variants that might affect transcriptional regulatory function through disruptions of promoter or enhancer elements where regulatory factors bind. We confirmed that the genes that were discovered using the non-coding element are statistically enriched in known genes involved in the diseases, which suggests that this annotation method is considerably relevant. We found that the diseases shared many associated genes, implying their inseparable relationship. A large number of epistatic interactions were also intricately connected between genes involved in DM, HT, and CAD. This integrated map, based on epistatic interactions, could provide a genetic basis for the underlying mechanisms of the increased prevalence of the diseases' dependence on one another. In conclusion, our results illustrate how extensive non-coding variant annotation based on chromatin interactions of distal enhancers can be used to dissect complex genetic interactions in complex diseases.
