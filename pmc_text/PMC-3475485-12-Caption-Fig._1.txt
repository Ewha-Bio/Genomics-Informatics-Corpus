Establishment of Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEFs. (A) Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of Pkd2 gene in Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells. Human- or mouse-specific PKD2 primer sets were used. 18s rRNA was used as a loading control. (B) Western blot analysis of polycystin 2 (PC2) expression in Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells. MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; KO, knockout (MEF); TG, transgenic (MEF); KOWT, knockout wild-type (MEF); TGWT, transgenic wild-type (MEF).
