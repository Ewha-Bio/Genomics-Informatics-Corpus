Comparison of chromothripsis-like pattern analysis
Genes included in the locus were identified in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) human genome.
We confirmed the similarity between the chromothripsis-like patterns identified in this study and the results reported in other studies through chromothripsisDB, which is a database for the identification of chromothripsis in many cancers.
