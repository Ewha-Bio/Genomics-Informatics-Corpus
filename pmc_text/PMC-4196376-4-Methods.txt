Statistical analyses
The case-control GWAS was conducted using PLINK software version 1.07 [11]. A quantile-quantile (QQ) plot and a Manhattan plot were produced using the R statistics package [12]. A regional plot was generated using LocusZoom 1.1 [13]. Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test were used to test differences in basic and clinical characteristics between case and control groups.
