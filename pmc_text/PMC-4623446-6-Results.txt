Statistics of datasets
Currently, we have created a database containing a total of 1,403 patient samples, among which 1,304 samples are Korean and the remained 99 samples are non-Korean patients for comparison. Most data in the current database were created by gene expression profiling (n = 1,283, 91%) and the remained (n = 120, 9%) were by methylation profiling methods. The vast majority of cancer tissues (n = 1,363, 97%) consists of liver (n = 431, 31%), breast (n = 365, 26%), stomach (n = 307, 22%), and bladder (n = 260, 19%), among which highly ranked three cancer types (i.e., liver, breast, and stomach) were known to be most frequently occurred in Korean. In each cancer type, we also designated previously known sample subtypes to support assessment of difference of a molecule between cancer subtypes. In addition, survival data of liver (n = 99) and bladder cancer patients (n = 165) were involved in the database to instantly estimate the prognostic value of a molecule in which users are interested (n = 264, 19%). Supplementary Table 1 elucidated detailed statistics in KCGD database.
