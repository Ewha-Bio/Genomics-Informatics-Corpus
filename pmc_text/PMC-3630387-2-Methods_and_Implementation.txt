Prerequisite
We assume the screen was done in 96- or 384-well plates and passed the standard quality control metric (by Z or Z' factor, for example). siMacro is robust against sporadic bad wells from triplicate experiments but will not censor an entire plate compromised by massive failure, such as broad contamination. We also assume siRNAs in the library plate are randomly distributed, which is generally true for most commercially available genomewide siRNA libraries. siMacro currently supports 1- or 2-condition screens.
