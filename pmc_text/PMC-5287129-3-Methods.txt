Animals, genotyping, quality control, and LD and Ne estimation
Blood samples were collected from BH, BNH, and JB. Twenty (n = 20) animals were sampled from each Korean breed. Genotype data of Korean cattle was merged with genotype data from six other Asian breeds that included YB, Luxi (LX), Hainan (HN), Qinchuan (QC), Wagyu (WAG), and MG cattle. The data for these six Asian breeds was downloaded from dryad.org [6]. There were a total of 129 samples from the 9 Asian breeds in the study (Table 1).
Genomic DNA for genotyping assays was extracted from the blood sample using DNeasy 96 Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA quantification was performed using a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). DNA samples were submitted for genotyping with total DNA of 900 ng, 260/280 ratio >1.8, and DNA concentration of 20 ng/µL. The genotyping for animals was done by the Animal Genome & Bioinformatics Division of the National Institute of Animal Science, Rural Development Administration (RDA), Korea, using a Bovine-SNP50 BeadChip ver. 1 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
Plink ver. 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) [7] was used for the quality control of the raw genotype data. Quality control was performed for minor allele frequency, missingness, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), and genotyping quality. Beagle program [8] was used for imputation of the missing genotypes. Five thousand sixty-seven markers were excluded based on HWE test (p ≤ 0.0001) and further 1,825 SNPs were excluded based on frequency test (minor allele frequency < 0.01). Final dataset consisted of a total of 28,708 SNPs. A total of 129 samples were analyzed in the study. SNeP program [9] was used to calculate pairwise LD and Ne. LD based Ne was calculated according to Sved [10] as below, r2 = 1/(4cNe + 1), where r2 is the LD, c is the recombination rate and Ne is the effective population size.
Population structure was studied using Fst and principal component analysis (PCA) as implemented in adegent R package [11]. Genetic distances among the pair of populations were calculated using “WC84” method implemented in Hierfstat [12].
