Merging Korean and Pan-Asian panels
To test our MergeReference software, we merged the Pan-Asian panel (n=441) [9] and the Korean panel (n=413) [10]. The Korean panel included 4526 SNPs, and the Pan-Asian panel included 4,603 SNPs in the MHC region (chr6:25-34Mb). The Korean panel had genotype information on six HLA genes (A, B, C, DRB1, DPB1, and DQB1), and the Pan-Asian panel had genotype information on eight HLA genes (A, B, C, DRB1, DPA1, DPB1, DQA1, and DQB1). After applying MergeReference, 2,995 overlapping SNPs and the genotype information of six overlapping HLA genes were left. Merging the two panels took less than 10 min on a standard computer (2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 CPU, 8 GB memory).
