Sequencing quality check, mapping, and data analysis
We used FastQC v0.11.5 to check the quality of the sequencing results. The simple Python script q30 (https://github.com/dayedepps/q30) was used to calculate the exact percentages of Q20/Q30. We used STAR_2.5.4b, an ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner, to align the RNA-seq data onto the hg19 reference genome [11]. We ran the mapping job with the quantMode set as the GeneCounts option. Using the R statistical language, we normalized the read count data and converted its scale into the base 2 logarithm of counts per million (cpm). A scatter plot was drawn using ggscatter, one of the functions of the R package ggpubr. Correlation graphs were drawn using Microsoft Excel 2013. The data used in drawing scatter plot and correlation graphs were normalized and converted into the base 2 logarithm of cpm, as mentioned above. To obtain Venn diagrams of the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the downregulated DEGs, we used jvenn, an interactive Venn diagram viewer (http://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html) [12].
