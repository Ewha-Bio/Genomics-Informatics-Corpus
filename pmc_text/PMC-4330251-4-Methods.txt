Survival analysis
Survival analysis was undertaken with the survival package in R (version 2.13.0). Survival time was represented by the days since cancer diagnosis in the hospital until the last contact date. The survival time of the patients who were still alive at the last contact date were treated as censored. Kaplan-Meier survival plot and Cox regression analysis were also performed with the survival package. In order to partition patients into two groups according to methylation level, the cutoff point was determined by the maximally selected rank statistics method, available in the R maxstat package.
