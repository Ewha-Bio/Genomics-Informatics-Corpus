Construction of the KFSR
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food and nutrient databases provide the basic infrastructure for food and nutrition research, nutrition monitoring, policy, and dietary practice. The databases date back to 1892 and they are unique, as the only databases available in the public domain that perform these functions. The Nutrient Data Laboratory develops and maintains the USDA Standard Reference and related data products [13]. The Standard Reference is the major source of food composition data in the United States. It provides the foundation for most food composition databases used in food policy, research, dietary practice, and nutrition monitoring. The USDA databases were used to construct the KFSR. This product is the basis of numerous other applications that address nutrients in foods. The database contains information on agricultural commodities, as well as data on formulated and processed foods. Currently, the database contains values for up to 140 different food components, including nitrogen (protein), total fat, carbohydrates, and moisture, as well as individual fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals in >7,500 foods. We have added five traditional Korean foods, i.e., kimchi, bulgogi, bibimbap, doenjang, and gochujang. To construct a useful KFSR, we integrated 11 public databases as shown in Table 2, with a total of 26,848,859 records.
