Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)
Selected genes were subjected to real-time PCR analysis in duplicate using the 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The measurement was normalized to a β actin RNA control. The primers of genes are as follows: TNF, F 5'-TCA GCG AGG ACA GCA AGG-3', R 5'-GTG AGT GAA AGG GAC AGA ACC-3'; β-actin, F 5'-CTT TGC AGC TCC TTC GTT GC-3', R 5'-ACG ATG GAG GGG AAT ACAGC-3'. The remaining primer sequences are available upon request.
