DMR of SFRP1 gene in colorectal cancer
Illumina Human DNA Methylation27 and 450 are microarray platforms that can measure the methylation values of promoter regions, with 27,578 and 331,182 probes, respectively. On the former platform, there are four probes in the promoter region of SFRP1, and their methylation status varies probe to probe, while the latter has 33 additional probes for SFRP1. We examined which probes showed hypermethylation and correlated with expression change using the expanded dataset, for which both data types were available (n = 203). Among the four SFRP1 probes that were shared between the two platforms, one of them (cg06166767, chr8:41287005) did not show hypermethylation, while the other three showed similar hypermethylation (Fig. 6). Table 3 shows the correlation between differential methylation and differential expression, which was measured using linear regression, revealing a significant correlation of cg15839448 (chr8:41285687) (p = 0.1E-9). R/Bioconductor package methy Analysis was used to depict the chromosomal location in relation to CGI, along with the methylation beta-value, as a heat map (Fig. 7), confirming the variation among probes. Aberrant methylation patterns of SFRP have been reported not only in colorectal cancers but also in gastric cancers [12], breast cancers [10], and pancreatic cancers [13]. From TCGA, we downloaded 12 matched pairs for each cancer of the following organs: bladder, breast, esophageal, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, and uterine corpus endometrium. Except for liver and endometrial cancers, the DNA methylation levels of both SFRP1 and SFRP2 were consistently higher in cancers than in the normal counterparts (Fig. 8). It should be noted that in colorectal cancers, the mean methylation M-value of the tumor samples was greater than 0. While stomach cancers (STAD) also showed a mean M of greater than 0, the difference between the tumor and normal sample was not as large as in colorectal cancers. In all other cancers, the mean M was below 0, implying marginal hypermethylation at most.
