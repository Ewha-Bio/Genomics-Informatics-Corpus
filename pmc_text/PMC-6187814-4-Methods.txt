GO analysis
We analyzed the GO of the top 5% genes (p-value order) associated with BF in Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. Because the test result with a p-value < 0.05 in our study was very genial and multiple testing such as the Bonferroni correction and the false discovery rate (FDR) of our study result was very restrictive, we performed the GO analysis with the top 5% genes. The gene catalogue was retrieved from Ensemble database (http://www.ensembl.org) and the GO analysis was performed with the DAVID (david.ncifcrf.gov; Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery v6.7). A list of gene identifiers was uploaded to summarize the functional annotations associated with groups or each individual genes and each biological processâ€“related GO terms was based on the number of genes and the p-values [7, 8].
