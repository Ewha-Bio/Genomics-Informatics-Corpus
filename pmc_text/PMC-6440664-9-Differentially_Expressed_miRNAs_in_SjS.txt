The history of investigating miRNAs in SjS is relatively short. The first journal article examining miRNAs in SjS was published only seven years ago in 2011 [15, 16]. Studies of miRNAs in SjS have utilized different types of samples, such as MSG collected from lip biopsies, sera, PBMC, or monocytes from blood ppub, and saliva or exosome from saliva ppub [15–19]. Utilization of mixed populations of cells or saliva that contains not only host-derived but also microorganism-derived miRNAs can cause difficulty in interpretation of the data. An interpretation of any published data on miRNAs will require some attention to the types of specimens and analysis methods utilized in a particular study. In addition, the exact implications of miRNAs in disease onset and regulation still await exploration. Nonetheless, the reported SjS-associated miRNA studies have provided valuable tools to discover the impact of miRNAs on SjS disease pathogenesis. This particular review is organized according to the category of specimens that have been utilized to investigate miRNA profiles in SjS. The intention of this approach was not necessarily to emphasize cell/target tissue specific regulation of miRNAs but to arrange the contents in a chronological manner, which happened to coincide with shifted interests in various sample utilization. Table 1 [10, 15, 16, 18–25] summarizes findings.
