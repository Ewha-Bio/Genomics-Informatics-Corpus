Considering that such membrane proteins as TMPRSS4 or TM4SF5 may be important upstream regulators of the EMT and the invasiveness of cancer cells and because their expression differs substantially in normal and cancer tissues, targeting them could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer metastasis. In the future, the functional involvement of TMPRSS4 and/or TM4SF5 in the initiation and progression of tumors needs to be evaluated using mouse models. Cancer-associated mutations and singlenucleotide polymorphisms within TMPRSS4 or TM4SF5 also need to be analyzed in association with cancer risk.
