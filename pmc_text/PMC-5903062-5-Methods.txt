Genetic substitution rate estimation of genes
After estimating HSF, we calculated each geneâ€™s substitution rate in Hanwoo and Holstein populations. The bovine gene catalog was retrieved from the ensemble website (http://www.ensembl.org). The novel calculation was based on the number of SNPs inside each gene and used K2P model. We surveyed the genes that had the highest and lowest substitution rates. We compared the genetic substitution rates of Hanwoo with those of Holstein.
