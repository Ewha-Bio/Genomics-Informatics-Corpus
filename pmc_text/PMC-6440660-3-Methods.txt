Virus taxonomy database
We collected the ICTV taxonomy from the “ICTV Master Species List,” which was officially announced in ICTV in 2016 (Table 2); the taxonomy history was obtained by web scraping. Furthermore, in order to extend the resource including strain and isolation information and to connect to the viral GenBank information, we downloaded “gbvrl1.seq.gz”~“gbvrl51.seq.gz” (the GenBank virus file) using an FTP protocol and classified the data according to ICTV taxonomy criteria. Currently, the classification table, which is designed in the current ICTV database, includes classification name, classification level, release number and year, classification ID (composed of 8 digits), the most recent classification change ID (composed of 8 digits), parent classification name, change status, and proposal documents [5].
However, in our web-based system, the current ICTV database was redesigned and divided as the tables in our database (Table 3). Specifically, to enhance the database and to make useful linkages for NCBI accession, the NCBI Taxonomy items described in Table 3 and the items parsed by web scraping were built as an “ICTV history” table and “ICTV Taxonomy” table in Table 3, respectively. The “2016 ICTV Species” table consists of the data parsed by the ICTV Master Species List (2016, v1.3).
