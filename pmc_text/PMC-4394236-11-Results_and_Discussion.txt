Model validation
The initial models were subjected to different structure evaluation tools for understanding the geometries, backbone configuration, dihedrals, and residue-residue interactions. The Ramachandran plot for the ER domain showed 0.5% residues in a disallowed region. In the case of the KR domain, 0.0% of the residues were in disallowed regions. Hence, these models were further refined using the WHAT IF program to remove the atomic bumps and subsequently loop-refined using MODELLER 9v7 scripts and the MODREFINER algorithm. The final refined structures of both domains showed no residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Figs. 3 and 4).
The overall stereochemical parameters for the modeled proteins were measured using G-factor and ERRAT calculations by PROCHECK. G-factor is a measure of the proper dihedrals and covalent bond orders, and it is expressed overall as log-odd score. G-factor scores for optimal structures range from 0.0 to 0.1 with increasing order of confidence. A negative G-factor score indicates improper conformation of the residues, while higher positive scores indicate proper conformation. In the case of the predicted model of the ER domain, the overall log-odd score was found to be 0.30, which indicates a high plausibility of the structure with negligible improper conformations. Similarly, the KR model also showed an overall G-factor score of 0.22, suggestive of a high plausibility of the structure. Moreover, the non-bonded atomic interactions of the models were analyzed using the ERRAT tool, wherein the overall quality score for the predicted structures of the ER and KR domains were found to be 95.92 and 80.85, respectively. The ERRAT scores for both models were above 50 and are considered a standard for good models. To validate this further, the modeled structures were also assessed for their quality using the ProQ server. ProQ assessment for the ER model predicted the LGscore to be 4.362 (>4.0, extremely good model) and the MaxSub score to be 0.416 (>0.1, fairly good model). Similarly, for the KR domain, the LGscore was 3.509 (>2.5, very good model) and the MaxSub score was 0.246 (>0.1, fairly good model), suggesting higher plausibility of the models.
