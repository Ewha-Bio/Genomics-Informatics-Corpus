Overview of our model. Our model utilized a simple deep neural network architecture with GSE85047 gene expression data. The classes are the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage of each patient from GSE85047. False positive rate (FPR), it is the calculated number of predicted false positives divided by the total number of negatives in the test set.; true positive rate (TPR), it is obtained as the number of predicted true positives divided by the total number of positives in the test set.
