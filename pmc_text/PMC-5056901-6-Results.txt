Association with SLE
A total of 656 cases and 622 controls were enrolled and genotyped to analyze the association with SLE. Minor allele frequencies of the five SNPs in this study were similar to those in East Asians from 1000 Genomes Database (Table 2) [19], suggesting that this study group can represent the Korean population and that our genotyping was reliable. We performed an association analysis with three different genetic models: allelic, dominant, and recessive (Table 3).
Of the five SNPs, rs1801274 in FCGR2A was significantly associated with the risk of SLE in all three models, but the other four SNPs did not show a significant association. Under allelic model, the minor allele frequency of genotype G in rs1801274 was significantly higher in SLE patients (AF = 0.285) than in controls (AF = 0.24) (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.50; p = 0.01). Also, the dominant model of minor allele in rs1801274 seems significantly associated with SLE (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.59; p = 0.03). Under recessive model, the genotype G/G of rs1801274 was significantly associated with SLE (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.39; p = 0.046).
