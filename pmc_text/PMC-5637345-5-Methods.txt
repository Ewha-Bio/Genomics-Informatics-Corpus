The miR-21-3p target genes and binding site analyses
The search of target genes was performed by miRTarBase release ver. 6.0 (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw) and TargetScanHuman ver. 7.1 program (http://www.targetscan.org). Target genes were predicted and their interaction between human target genes and miR-21-3p was done by RNA hybrid ver. 2.1 program (http://bibiserv2.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid). Minimum free energy (MFE) score by binding affinity of miRNA and their target genes were also obtained in RNA hybrid program. TargetScan-Human program was used to verify binding regions of the miRNAs and their target gene 3´ UTR region. This program carries out whether target gene 3´ UTR sequences in several vertebrates. The mature miR-21-3p sequences were acquired from miRBase program matched with aligned 3´ UTR domain. Target genes of Gene Ontology (GO) for miR-21-3p was conducted through PANTHER (Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships) classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org/), which is related to the three functional categories: molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC).
