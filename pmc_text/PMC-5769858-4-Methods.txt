MD simulation
The predicted structures were located in a cubic box of water; then, 3-ns MD simulations were carried out using GROMACS, ver. 5.1.2 [17]. Amber99sb was chosen as the force field [18]. Energies of the models were minimized using the steepest descent algorithm for 3 ns. The step size was 0.002 ps. The properties and stabilities of the models were evaluated based on the potential energy, total energy, and root-mean-square deviation of the atomic positions.
