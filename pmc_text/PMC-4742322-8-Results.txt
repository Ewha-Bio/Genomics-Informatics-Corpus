Three amino acid positions in the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules
The frequency of amino acid residues at HLA-DRβ1 position 13 and position 71, and HLA-DQβ1 position 57 and their association with fulminant T1DM are shown in Table 3. A histidine residue at HLA-DRβ1 position 13 showed marginal association with fulminant T1DM by Fisher's exact test (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.01 to 5.94; p = 0.054) and Cochran-Armitage trend test (p = 0.034). However, none of the other amino acid residues at the three positions showed a significant association with fulminant T1DM.
