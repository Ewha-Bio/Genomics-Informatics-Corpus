Mock community
The mock community data for evaluation were obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive (accession number: PRJEB6244) [5]. The data were generated so that 59 strains had uniform abundance, and they were used to validate biases and sequencing errors in the previous paper. In order to maintain the consistency of the data, only the six samples sequenced using the V3/V4 primer in the hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were used (sample accession ERS447183, ERS447184, ERS447185, ERS447186, ERS447187, and ERS447188).
