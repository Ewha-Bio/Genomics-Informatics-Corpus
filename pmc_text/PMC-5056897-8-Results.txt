Sequences of 340 HPs from H. pylori 26695 strain tested with exclusive pipeline developed by our group [23, 57]. We used several tools for the sequence analysis such as, BLAST, CATH, SCOP, CDART, InterProScan, Motif, protein family databases, conserved domain databases, protein cluster database, protein-protein interaction database, and other such analysis tools such as virulence predictors, subcellular localization prediction programs, etc. Data produced by all these methods and prediction programs help us deducing results. We successfully assigned probably functions to 104 HPs with high confidence (Table 1). As mentioned earlier, the basis of the confidence level was consensus based, i.e., the similar function for an HP predicted by four or more programs was considered function for the HP with high confidence and precision. To reduce redundancy and to maintain the reliability of the results, we deliberately omitted the HPs for which functions were predicted with low level and less precision.
