Chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis is widely recognized and recommended as the first-tier cytogenetic diagnostic test for patients with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), or multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs) [1, 2].
DD describes persons aged 5 years or younger who have demonstrated several significant delays in the following areas: cognitive, speech, social/personal, fine/gross motor, and daily activities. ID is diagnosed at or after age 5 years when oneâ€™s intelligence quotient is deemed to be less than 70 and when permanent intellectual impairment results in a general deficit in adaptive behaviors [3]. ASD comprises a wide range of neurological and developmental disabilities, encompassing autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders, and childhood disintegrative disorder [3]. MCAs refer to the presence of multiple major malformations, such as cardiac defects and missing limbs, or 3 or more minor malformations (e.g., syndactyly and club feet).
Combined, these disorders are highly prevalent (DD/ID, up to 3% [4]; ASDs, 1% to 2% [5]; MCAs, 0.16% [6]) and might have a genetic etiology, such as copy number variation (CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The prevalence of pathogenic CNVs is high in those with autism (5% to 10%) and children with both ID and MCAs (20% to 25%) [7].
CMA is a high-resolution, high-throughput technique that detects submicroscopic CNVs that are not observable with traditional cytogenetic analysis tools, including karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) [8]. Further, CMA has a higher diagnostic yield (12.2% on average) than conventional tests [1, 2]. However, as with next-generation sequencing (NGS), interpreting microarray anomalies poses challenges for clinical laboratories and clinicians in establishing the clinical significance and pathogenicity of the detected CNVs.
Variability in the interpretation arises from internal databases that are limited by the number of cases that are analyzed; racial and socio-economic bias; and the complete lack of openly accessible centralized resources for sharing CMA data, patient phenotypes, and clinical interpretations between laboratories in South Korea and overseas. Moreover, disparate technology platforms with varying array designs, resolution, and coverage render the standardization of CMA and its uniform interpretation more difficult.
In this study, we attempted to establish the origin of DD, ID, ASDs, and MCAs in 42 Korean patients; demonstrate the value of CMA in determining the genomic etiology of unexplained DD, ID, and MCAs; and discuss the challenges facing CMA.
