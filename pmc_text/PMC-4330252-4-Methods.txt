Enrichment of epistatic SNPs in regulatory elements
To test for the enrichment of epistatic SNPs (Table 2) in regulatory elements, we overlapped SNPs with enhancers (see below) and footprints data. We obtained genomic DNase I footprints across 41 cell types from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project (The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012; http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODDE/downloads.html). Nucleotide resolution analysis of DNase I cleavage patterns allowed us to discover the footprints of where the transcription factor bound [8].
To determine whether the observed count was significantly greater than expected by chance, we randomly selected 7,967 variants (the same number of epistatic SNPs) from dbSNPs (59,180,134 autosomal SNPs) and repeated the overlap analysis 1,000 times. The level of significance (p-value) was computed as the proportion of counts that were equal to or larger than the observed count from the null distribution.
