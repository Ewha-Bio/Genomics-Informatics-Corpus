Study of binding affinity between miRNAs and AGO protein through docking
The three-dimensional structure of AGO protein, with 685 amino acid residues, was retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 3F73, chain A). The AGO protein is a silencing complex structure with a seed containing guide DNA and target RNA duplexes. The structure preparation and correction of AGO protein were performed in Discovery Studio 3.5 suite before docking. The docking between miRNA-mRNA duplexes (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) and AGO protein was carried out separately in the PachDock online server on the basis of geometrical shape complementary scores. Out of 10 binding complexes generated for each miRNA-mRNA duplex docked with AGO protein, the highest-scoring complex was chosen as the best binding mode. However, a good dock score in all cases of docking between the selected miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b) and AGO protein implicated a strong interaction between them at the molecular level (Supplementary Table 5).
