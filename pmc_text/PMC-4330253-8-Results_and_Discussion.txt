In silico annotation of the linked genes and functional relevance
The 10 associated SNPs and the LD SNPs were located in six functional gene regions, and one SNP was located in the intergenic region. The top signals were located downstream of a functional spliceosome-associated protein, named BUD13, a homolog of yeast (BUD13) gene chromosome 11 and near the BUD13 gene. BUD13 has been reported to be associated with lipid, metabolic syndrome X [23], TG [32], and metabolic traits in East Asians [8], demonstrating that it is putatively functionally associated with METS in the Korean population (Supplementary Table 1).
The second significant SNP was rs6589566, which has 6 high-LD SNPs. Notably, in silico annotation of the SNP's function showed that rs651821 was located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the APOA5 gene, and also, the SNP was reported as an eQTL of the transgelin (TAGLN) gene (Table 4). The results indicate that the remaining SNPs are surrogate markers of rs6589566. Among them, rs651821 and rs964184 are associated with TG level, as one component of METS evaluation, in Chinese populations [26] and in Mexicans [35]. Both SNPs exhibit eQTL of the TAGLN gene. TAGLN has been documented as a repressive regulator of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene expression [36] and is considered a putative tumor suppressor due to suppression of MMP-9, which harbors tumor metastatic properties [37]. However, MMP-9 is also involved in the progression of METS via chymase activity [38] and has been suggested to be used a diagnostic marker of METS [39]. Thus, it can be explained that the functional eQTL TAGLN of rs651821 and rs964184 could be a novel marker for the evaluation of METS in terms of strong regulation of MMP-9.
The third most significant signals were located in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene region. Three SNPs (rs10503669, rs17482753, and rs17410962) located in chr 8 were eQTL that contributed to LPL expression in monocytes. LPL is a critical protein of lipid metabolism and is significantly associated with METS in Asian Indians [40], indicating that the functional eQTL-SNP of LPL expression could be a marker for the evaluation of METS in Korean populations. Those three SNPs were in strong LD with rs328, which is a stop-gain mutation of the LPL coding sequence [41] (Supplementary Table 1). Although the remaining 14 SNPs were non-eQTL-SNPs, those SNPs have been reported as being in association with HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and obesity, indicating that they are putative candidate markers for the evaluation of METS.
Although the remaining 6 SNPs and their nearest genes have not been functionally studied regarding METS-associated traits, further studies are required to elucidate for their role in METS.
