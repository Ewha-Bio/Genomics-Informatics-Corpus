Estimation of the association strength
To estimate the association strength, GIDS is calculated using Eq. (1). The number of samples, nij, that goe into the formula for GIDS is counted using a 2-way contingency table, constructed for the k-locus interactive genotype and J-class phenotype, as diagrammed in Fig. 1. The number of elements of this table will be 3k × J. GIDS would be calculated exhaustively for every SNP or combination of SNPs associated with a multi-class categorical phenotype. Any order of a gene-gene interaction associated with a phenotype of an arbitrary number of categories can be estimated in theory, limited only by computing time. GIDS spans from 0 to 1, representing null and maximum association at either of the extremes. p-values that account for multiple comparisons can be obtained by constructing a null distribution common to all of the GIDS values [9]. Permutation of the dataset is performed to provide a non-associated dataset. A single GIDS that has the maximum value among all GIDS values obtained with a permuted dataset is collected. Repeated permutation and collection make the null distribution of GIDS. Now, a p-value should be the probability that the null distribution exceeds a particular GIDS value. Using this null distribution, GIDS can be standardized as follows, where GIDS¯ and SGIDS represent the mean and standard deviation of the null distribution, respectively.
s G I D S = G I D S - G I D S ¯ S G I D S (3)
Association strengths from different orders of gene-gene interactions may be compared using the standardized GIDS (sGIDS), defined above [10].
