Overall mutation frequency in tissue samples. (A) The distribution of 2,938 patient tissue samples for the number of mutant genes per sample. (B) The distribution of 23,050 mutant genes for % mutation frequency. (C) Box plot of the number of mutant genes per sample for each caner subtype. (D) Box plot of % sample frequency of individual mutation for each caner subtype. Number in the box represents median value.
