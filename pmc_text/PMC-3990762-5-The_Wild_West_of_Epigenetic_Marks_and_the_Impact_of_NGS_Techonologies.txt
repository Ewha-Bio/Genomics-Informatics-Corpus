Histone modifications
Chromosomal DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, essentially composed of 4 kinds of subunits; viz., H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. These proteins are subject to chemical modifications at specific residues of histone tails; some well-studied modifications include phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination [38]. These modifications are involved in setting the stage for directed transcriptional activation and repression by controlling DNA accessibility or recruitment of other protein complexes. This idea has been extended into the "histone code" hypothesis [39, 40]-that complex combinations of distinct histone modifications, like H3K27me3 (a mark of repressed regions), H3K4me3 (a mark of gene promoters), and H3K27ac (a mark of transcriptionally active regions), etc. [41], underlie specific transcriptional programs. This notion has been further extended in more recent works into an 'epigenomic code' to include epigenomic marks other than histone modifications [42].
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of DNA-histone complexes is achieved by cross-linking histones with the DNA, digesting the cross-linked DNA, and then using an antibody specific to the N-tail modification of interest (to any of the >100 post-translational modifications to histone tails and globules [43]), followed by sequencing of the purified DNA fragments. This method is called chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and was primarily used to map the genomic locations of DNA-associated proteins. Due to the relatively large fragment size, the mapped sequence reads thus obtained from ChIP-seq [21] provide a low-resolution localization map of modified histones in the genome. An alternative strategy, chromatin immunoprecipitation-exonuclease (ChIP-exo), uses exonuclease to digest the precipitated DNA fragment from either end to better resolve the modified loci at base-pair resolution [22].
