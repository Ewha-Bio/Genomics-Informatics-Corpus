Statistical analysis
Basic statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted with normalized log2-gene expression values using Cluster 3.0, and the results were visualized using Java Treeview [15, 16]. An unrooted tree was drawn with R package. Biological function analysis was performed with official gene names using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).
