KM analysis of combined samples of cancers on expression of G64. (A) KM plot of the combined six samples of the survival-differentiating cancers by G64, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, brain lower-grade glioma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal papilloma cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and sarcoma (see Table 1, upper six cancers). (B) KM plot of the 16 remaining samples of the survivalnon- differentiating cancers (see Table 1, lower 16 cancers). Low, the lowest 15% group; INT, intermediate group; High, the highest 15% group; HR, hazard ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.
