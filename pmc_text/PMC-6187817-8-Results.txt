Pharmacometabolomic analyses result
A total of four metabolites of drug X (cysteine conjugation, cysteinylglycine conjugation, methylation, oxidative defluorination) were observed from the plasma samples. Among these metabolites, cysteine and cysteinylglycine conjugation metabolites were detected in functional GSTM1 subjects, but they were absent in GSTM1 null subjects (Fig. 4). The areas under the peak for methylation and oxidative defluorination metabolites were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the functional GSTM1 subjects (Fig. 4).
