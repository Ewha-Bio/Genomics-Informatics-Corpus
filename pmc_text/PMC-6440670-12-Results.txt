Sanger sequencing
The short DNA fragment with a size of 490 bp was sequenced to confirm that our restriction and ligation assay did not distort the DNA sequence of our design scheme. The result showed 100% identity, which shows that the “start” and “end” random linker sequences and signal sequences for “0” and “1” were all well conserved after the assays for fragment preparation (Fig. 6).
