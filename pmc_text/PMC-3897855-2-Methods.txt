Study population
A total of 62 eligible subjects were recruited from 3rd grade to 6th grade students of elementary schools in 2005. Ethical permission for the study was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards, and all subjects provided written informed consent. Demographics of age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, muscle, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and BMR, as well as skinfold thickness, lipid profile, and hematological data, were also recorded. All variables were measured for developing the predictive equation model of BMR.
