The secondary structure database was constructed from 92,998 PDB chains and 64,799 SCOP entries based on the simple classification scheme according to the backbone torsion angles (http://lcbb.snu.ac.kr/TorsWebDB). SCOP entry 3D structure files were obtained from the ASTRAL PDB style database [5-7]. The function of the calculation of new secondary structures is additionally supplied. The backbone torsion angle-based structure alignment tool is also supplied by the newly developed web server. The platform of the web application was built in the machine with an AMD phenome II quad-core CPU (3.0 GHz) and openSUSE Linux 11.2 operating system. JAVA/JSP infrastructure was utilized for the construction of the server platform.
The web application introduced here offers functions of secondary structure database search, secondary structure calculation, and pair-wise protein structure comparison. The index page of the server web application supplies hyperlinks to the three functions, along with a general introduction and the explanation of the cases of limitations in the supply of data (Fig. 1). The query for each function is input, and the result is retrieved through JSP pages in coordination with MySQL database engines in the case of the secondary structure database search. The results of the secondary structure database search query display information of entries of the searched database that satisfy the criteria (Fig. 2). Protein structure comparison supports pair-wise comparison of proteins from both uploaded files and specified IDs of SCOP entries, and the result of the comparison displays logPr and RamRMSD values as similarity measurements and CPU times that were spent for the calculation of each value (Fig. 3).
