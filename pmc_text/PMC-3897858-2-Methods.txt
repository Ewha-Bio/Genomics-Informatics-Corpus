Dataset
All 46 ligand molecules in the dataset, comprising 23 AdoR agonists and 23 antagonists, are shown in Table 1, with the Tanimoto distance of each ligand from adenosine.
The Tanimoto coefficient is a widely used measure of molecular structural similarity. The coefficient is defined as Tc = Nab/(Na + Nb - Nab), with Nab being the number of common bits, Na the unique bits in molecule a, and Nb the unique bits in molecule b, using a molecular fingerprint [18]. In this study, the molecular similarity to adenosine was calculated as the Tanimoto coefficient using the 38-bit set. The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) and 3-dimensional structure data format (SDF) files of the dataset were downloaded from the PubChem Compound Database in National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and used in further analyses.
