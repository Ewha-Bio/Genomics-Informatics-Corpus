This hypothesis suggested the trans-Pacific dispersion of Crocodylus from the Indo-Pacific to the New World around 8~12 MYA, followed by moving to Africa from the New World around 4~8 MYA. This hypothesis was supported by at least three pieces of evidence: the presence of fossil crocodilian records within Asia and the New World [173], the distribution of the saltwater crocodile C. porosus, and the extinct Crocodylus lineage in the Pacific islands. Molecular phylogenetic placement by Oaks [16] showed the sister group of C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis clade and New World Crocodylus species. However, it is hard to explain how C. porosus (2n = 34) and/or C. palustris and C. siamensis (2n = 30) migrated and evolved into New World species (2n = 32), whose karyotype retains an ancestral form. It is likely that the C. porosus karyotype resulted from the proto-Crocodylus karyotype by centric fission, and the New World species karyotypes experienced centric fusion reversibly again from C. porosus.
