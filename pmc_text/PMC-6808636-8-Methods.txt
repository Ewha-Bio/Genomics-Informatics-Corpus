Allele frequency difference analysis between the two control cohorts
We performed association tests to compare allele frequencies between the control cohorts. We used the logistic regression model in PLINK v.1.90b (--logistic) [10]. To set the phenotypes, the UKBS cohort was set as “control” and the 58C cohort as “case.” We first conducted two-cohort association tests for genome-wide SNPs across the genome. Since we did not have regional information on the samples, which was used in similar analyses in the WTCCC study, we controlled for possible population stratification by including the top 20 PCs as additional covariates. For the HLA analysis, we tested all imputed markers, including HLA alleles, amino acids, and SNPs in the MHC region. Similar to the genome analysis, we included the same top 20 PCs as covariates in the HLA analysis.
