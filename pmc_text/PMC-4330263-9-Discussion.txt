SNP-GBLUP and its applicability
The G-BLUP uses the GRM. This matrix contains the information between individuals. However, SNP-BLUP and SNP-GBLUP use the direct information between SNPs. SNP-BLUP is assumed to be IID between SNPs. This IID assumption is good but not accurate, because it ignores the interaction terms between SNPs. Instead, SNP-GBLUP uses the covariance structures directly. This BLUP is more proximal to actuality than SNP-BLUP.
The covariance terms of the SNP-SNP relationship matrix can be used as interaction terms in phenotype-related analysis. It can provide the scientist with clues for SNP-SNP interactions. The covariance terms of it are independent of the phenotypic values, because they came from the Z matrix and GRM. However, after proper constant multiplication, as in BLUP, they may be interpreted as interaction terms between SNPs.
Probably, the SNP effects through SNP-GBLUP rather than SNP-BLUP can be used in Bayesian BLUP. Bayesian BLUP excludes the low or zero effects of SNPs. The accurately calculated SNP effects through SNP-GBLUP can be classified into low-effect SNPs and high-effect SNPs as absolute values. Low-effect SNPs can be excluded, and Bayesian BLUP can exploit only high-effect SNPs [24, 25, 26].
