Overview of mutations
We have identified 12,908 somatic mutation candidates in 10 AML sequenced exomes, including 1,281 point mutations, 625 insertion/deletions (Indels) (Table 1, Fig. 3). The point mutations include 7,483 synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs), 4,297 nonsynonymous SNVs, 282 stopgain SNVs, 14 stoploss SNVs, and 5 frameshift substitutions, and the Indels include 247 frame shift insertions, 310 frameshift deletions, and 68 nonframe shifts (Fig. 4). For each patient, the average nonsynonymous mutation count was 429.7 (SD, 97.16).
About 342 to 665 genes have nonsynonymous somatic mutation candidates at least once in each AML sample (Table 2). Recurrent mutated genes were observed in all samples.
