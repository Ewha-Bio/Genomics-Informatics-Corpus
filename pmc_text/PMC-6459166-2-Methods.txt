Obtaining genomic structures, including introns and promoters, in the human genome
We retrieved information about introns and other genomic structures using the same methods as in our previous studies [10,11]. Briefly, the 300-bp regions around exon-intron boundaries were excluded to avoid including splicing control sites [15]. Extremely short or long genes were also removed; too short was defined as a total length < 1 kb, while too long was defined as a length > [third quartile + (interquartile range Ã— 1.5)] of the total length. Sequences from the Y chromosome were removed. Repeats were removed using RepeatMasker (http://repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker). Repeat sequences in the 2-kb upstream sequences were also masked using RepeatMasker after they were retrieved from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser.
