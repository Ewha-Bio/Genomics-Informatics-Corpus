Recently, there was a very unique bio-art exhibition by New York-based artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, titled "Stranger Visions" [1]. She collected samples from discarded chewing gum, strands of hair, and cigarette butts around New York City. She took these items to Genspace, a do-it-yourself community biology laboratory, where DNA was extracted from each of the objects. By sequencing specific genomic regions and cross-referencing the results with published data, she was able to create 3-dimensional (3D) sculpted portraits of her anonymous donors using a 3D printer. She said that this work is designed to stimulate a cultural dialog about genetic surveillance. However, this provocative art project surely raises a question: Is it ethical?
To find an answer to this question, as a starting point, it would be helpful to review some major conventions, resolutions, declarations, or guidelines issued by international public organizations, such as the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); and the Council of Europe. These norms have been providing the principles and recommendations that guide the member states in their legislation and policy. They are worth reviewing, because, as Marie Curie once wrote, "science is essentially international." Knowledge, technologies, and money-capital and research fund-in the bioscience field cross borders freely and very quickly. In this review, seven international standards relevant to genetics and genomics will be introduced briefly in chronological order with some background information, and the possible answer to the questions with regard to the bio-art project will be provided after that.
