Top functions and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) networks. (A) The top functions for all treatments. As noted, various treatments had various effects on their respective pathways and functions, with 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) the most active ligand, followed by interferon-β (IFN-β) and 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br). (B) TNF networks. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) pictures show the down- and upregulation of the ligand-induced gene expression changes.
