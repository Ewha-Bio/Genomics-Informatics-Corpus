Sequence compositional features
The codon usage table of Homo sapiens was obtained (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), and used to calculate Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) (http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/) for each coding domain sequence (CDS). The tRNA Adaptation Index (tAI) was also measured for each CDS using Visual Gene Developer 1.4 Build 750. The frequencies per thousand of all of 61 codons were calculated for all 65 CDSs by Countcodon program (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/countcodon.html). Also, The Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) of all amino acids was measured (http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/codon_usage) for all desired proteins.
