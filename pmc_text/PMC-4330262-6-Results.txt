Stable cell lines
We have previously established stable cell lines over-expressing human COX-2 in U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. To avoid clonal variations, we established three stable COX-2-overexpressing cell lines (U2OS-COX-2 #1, #2, and #3) and three control cell lines (U2OS-pcDNA3 #1, #2, and #3). High levels of COX-2 expression were observed by western blot analysis in U2OS-COX-2 cells, whereas the expression was barely detectable in U2OS-pcDNA3 cells. When we cultured the stable cell lines, we observed that cell proliferation, migration, and invasion rates were increased significantly in U2OS-COX-2 cells as compared with U2OS-pcDNA3 cells [14] (Table 1).
