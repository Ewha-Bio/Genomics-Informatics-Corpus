Data analysis
The pharmacokinetic parameters of drug X were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis and presented using descriptive statistics. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUClast), which represents the systemic exposure to drug x, is summarized by genotype and dose groups. The apparent clearance (CL/F), which represents the capacity of drug elimination from the body, was pooled among the dose groups, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the CL/F between the genotype groups. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The number of drug-related adverse events (AEs) between the genotype groups was compared using the chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
