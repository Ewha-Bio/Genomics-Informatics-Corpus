Study subjects
The study subjects consisted of two population-based cohorts, Ansung and Ansan, which have been conducted as part of the KoGES. The phenotype of the cohort population was previously described [14]. Briefly, the subjects came from the Ansung and Ansan cities, located in Gyeonggi-do province near Seoul, Korea. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and this research project was approved by the institutional review board in the Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH).
Subjects with genotype accuracies below 98% and high missing genotype call rates (â‰¥4%), high heterozygosity (>30%), or inconsistency in sex were excluded from subsequent analyses. Individuals who had a tumor were excluded, as were related individuals whose estimated identity-by-state values were high (>0.80). After these quality control steps, 8,842 samples were selected.
