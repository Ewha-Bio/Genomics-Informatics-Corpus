The current study focused on in silico verification of miRNAs for targeting the HOXA9 gene, associated in AML, and the molecular interaction of catalytic AGO protein with these miRNAs to study the gene silencing mechanism computationally. As the literature has reported [1213], four mature miRNAs-namely, miR-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b-are found to have target sites in the HOXA9 gene and were hence taken for further study. The binding sites in HOXA9 were predicted for these miRNAs using miRTarBase (Supplementary Tables 1 and 3), which was followed by the secondary structure prediction and miRNA-mRNA duplex formation. Two binding sites were predicted for mir-196b in the HOXA9 gene (Supplementary Table 1), denoted mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2, respectively; so, two duplexes are formed between mir-196b and mRNA of the HOXA9 gene (Supplementary Table 3). The results suggested a strong and energetically favorable binding mode between all miRNA-mRNA duplexes (Supplementary Table 4), which is also supported by the reported interaction between them (Fig. 1). The good MFE score (-5.90 kcal/mol) also reflected that mir-145 had the highest binding affinity for the HOXA9 gene (Supplementary Table 4) among all miRNAs. Furthermore, to study the molecular interaction between AGO protein and miRNA-mRNA duplexes (miR-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2), molecular docking was carried out. The presence of strong hydrophobic amino acid residues (LEU 652, LEU 267, ALA 644, and ALA 648 in mir-145; LEU 267, LEU 277, LEU 279, LEU 281, ALA 278, ALA 648, and VAL 606 in mir-126; LEU 267, LEU 279, LEU 281, and ALA 278 in let-7a; ALA 111, VAL 58, and LEU 132 in mir-196b.1; and VAL 549, VAL 152, and ALA 170 in mir-196b.2) within a distance of 3.5 Å in the binding pocket of miRNAs implicates strong binding interactions at the molecular level between AGO protein and all chosen miRNAs (Table 1, Fig. 2A-2E). Also, amino acids with aromatic rings (TYR 642, PHE 649, and PHE 647 in mir-145; PHE 649 in mir-126; and TYR 171 and TYR 135 in mir-196b.2) were also observed within a distance of 3.5 Å, which supports the binding interaction (Table 1, Fig. 2A-2E) between AGO protein and miRNAs. The amino acid residues participated in hydrogen bonding (Table 2, Fig. 3A-3E) with miRNAs (miR-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) within a distance of 3.0 Å, showing strong evidence of binding and a molecular interaction between AGO protein and all chosen miRNAs. The current investigation proved that mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2 have strong binding affinity for the HOXA9 gene and also throws light on AGO protein-assisted molecular interactions with miRNA-mRNA duplex structures. This report would be helpful in understanding miRNA-based gene silencing mechanisms for the HOXA9 gene in AML disease. Furthermore, a molecular dynamic simulation approach might be implemented to study the dynamic behavior of these interactions, which would help us better understand miRNA-based gene silencing mechanisms in AML computationally. Once validated experimentally, this methodology would further help us to design suitable miRNAs against respective genes rationally.
