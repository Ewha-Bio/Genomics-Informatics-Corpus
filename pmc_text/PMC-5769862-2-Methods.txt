Data source
The end sequences of B. rapa accession Chiifu-401–42, a Chinese cabbage BAC library (KBrH, KBrB, and KBrS), were downloaded from NCBI and used to verify the putative misassembly genome regions. In order to investigate the gene synteny relation between A. thaliana TAIR10 and B. rapa genome V1.5, the corresponding general feature format (GFF) annotation files and protein sequences of each species were downloaded from http://ensemblgenomes.org and http://brassicadb.org, respectively. The GBS data were produced by a previous study that investigated the correlation between flavonoid content and the genotype of B. rapa in 69 individuals of a doubled haploid F2 generation obtained by microbial culture of an F1 generation cross of two subspecies—yellow sarson of LP08 (B. rapa ssp. tricolaris) and pak choi of LP21 (B. rapa ssp. chinensis)—with distinct morphologies [26]. From the study, genotype data were obtained at a total of 8,176 positions.
