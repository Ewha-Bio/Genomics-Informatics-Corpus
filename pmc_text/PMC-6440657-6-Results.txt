Functional annotation and classification
The transcripts derived from C. japonicum were subjected to annotation using the BLASTX program based on a homology search against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database. The highest homologous subject in each contig was selected for gene annotation. The identified contigs were contigs that hit to variable species with a high similarity homologous BLAST search. In total, 33,525 (65%) unigenes were annotated using the BLASTX program. The similarity distribution demonstrated that C. japonicum was highly similar to Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus (72%) (Fig. 2). GO broadly categorizes genes into one of three classes (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function) to describe their involvement in plant biological phenomena. The transcript functions were predicted with the help of the GO terms using Blast2GO based on their similarities to transcripts available in the nr database. All assembled transcripts were surveyed at an E-value of 1 × 10−6. The numbers of genes assigned to the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories were 9,336, 2,371, and 1,163, respectively (Fig. 3). Among the biological processes transcripts, the highest number of transcripts was assigned to cellular processes (13,538), followed by metabolic processes (12,322) and single organism processes (11,785). Several other processes, including biological regulation and response to stimulus, also comprised a significant number of transcripts (Fig. 3, biological process). The most prominent molecular functions included binding activity (12,037) and catalytic activity (10,141) (Fig. 3, molecular function). In the cellular component analysis, most transcripts were assigned to cell (12,808), cell part (12,251), organelle (8,806), and membrane (8,272). Macro-molecular complex (5,632), membrane part (5,265), and organelle part (4,717) also had a substantial number of transcripts (Fig. 3, cellular component).
