Amplifying DNA fragments using PCR
We designed a vector primer for the DNA fragment amplification. We used EmeraldAmp PCR Master Mix (cat. no. RR300A; Takara Bio, Tokyo, Japan), where the condition was one cycle at 95°C for 5 min; followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 72°C for 1 min/kbp; and one cycle for 10 min at 72°C for definite extension. The PCR product was purified using an AccuPrep PCR/Gel DNA Purification Kit (cat. no. K-3037-CFG; Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea).
