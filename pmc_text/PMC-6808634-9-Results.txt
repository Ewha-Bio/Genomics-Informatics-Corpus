qRT-PCR validation of DEG profiles
The expression profiles of nine genes involved in the cell cycle (CDKB1 and CyclinC1) and chromosomal segregation (Msh, Della, b-tubulin, KIN, and SPO) were validated by qRT-PCR. Expression values were compared by calculating log2FC obtained by the RPKM values from RNA-seq data and Ct values from qRT-PCR. Of the nine genes, eight genes were consistent with RNA-seq and qRT-PCR results and one gene (Cyclin C1) showed opposite expression patterns in RNA-seq vs. qRT-PCR (Fig. 4). The raw expression data showed that there were two isoforms of Cyclin C1, one was up-expressed whereas another was down-expressed. Thus, the obscure result of Cyclin C1 of RNA-seq versus qRT-PCR may require further investigation. Our results indicate that despite the limited number of DEG analyzed in the presence or absence of B chromosomes, genes related to the cell cycle and chromosome segregation were affected by the presence of B chromosomes.
