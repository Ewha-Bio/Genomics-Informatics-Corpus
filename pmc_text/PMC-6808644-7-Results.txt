Since a number of fusion detection programs are already available in public, it is critical to compare the performance of programs objectively. We have carried out the performance evaluation tests for FusionScan, SOAPfuse v.1.26, deFuse v.0.6.1, FusionHunter v.1.4, FusionMap v.2012-08-12, and TopHat-Fusion v.2.0.9 using both experimental and simulation data sets. All programs were run with the default options using the recommended mapping programs and transcriptome model as summarized at the bottom of Table 2. For TopHat-Fusion, we used the output from the TopHat-Fusion-Post that reduced the false-positives using BLAST search since it produced too many false-positives without the -Post option. The feature of blacklist was not used for fair comparison.
