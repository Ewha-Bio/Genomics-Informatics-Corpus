Primer selection and assay design
Seventeen SNPs in MTHFR, MTRR, and MTR were selected, covering previously studied SNPs, such as C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) in MTHFR [29] and A66G (rs1801394) in MTR [27]. The SNP information, including nucleic acid sequences, was collected from dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/; Build 136). SNPs in coding regions and promoters were chosen at first. Regulatory SNPs with validated allele frequency and nonsynonymous cSNPs were finally included. Multiplexed PCR primers were designed for the best PCR reaction and designed for evading the biophysical hurdle - secondary structure, self-ligation, competition of primers, etc. - using MassARRAY Assay Designer version 3.0 (Sequenom, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) (Table 2).
