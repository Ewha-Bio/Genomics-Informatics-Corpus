KARE dataset
The KARE project was initiated in 2007 to undertake a large-scale GWAS with 10,038 participants from two community-based cohorts (i.e., the rural Anseong and urban Ansan cohorts). Among the participants, 10,004 samples were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). From sample and SNP quality controls, a total of 8,842 individuals were selected from the Anseong (2,374 men and 2,263 women) and Ansan (1,809 men and 2,396 women) cohorts [27]. Missing genotypes were imputed using the Beale software program [28].
In this study, a total of 3,985 samples were selected from among the 8,842 individuals using T2D diagnostic criteria [2930]. A total of 1,042 subjects were included in the T2D group according to the following criteria: (1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) larger than or equal to 126 mg/dL, 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (Glu120) larger than or equal to 200 mg/dL, (2) treatment of T2D, and (3) age of disease onset â‰¥ 40 years. The inclusion criteria for nondiabetic normal subjects (n = 2,943) were as follows: (1) FPG less than or equal to 100 mg/dL or Glu120 less than or equal to 140 mg/dL and (2) no history of diabetes. The demographic variables of the subjects are summarized in Table 1.
