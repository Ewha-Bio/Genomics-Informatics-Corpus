Relationship between TPM and FPKM
The relationship between TPM and FPKM is derived by Pachter (2011) [9] in review of transcript quantification method, using Eq. (10)–(13) in Pachter’s study [9].
T P M g = R C g L g * 1 ∑ j R C j L k * 10 6 ∝ R C g L g * N * 1 ∑ j R C j L k * N ∝ R C g L g * N * 10 9 ,
where N = ∑tRCt is the total number of mapped reads. If FPKM is available, then TPM can be easily computed as
T P M g = ( F P K M g ∑ j F P K M g ) × 10 6 .
