Statistical analysis
Chi-square test was used to estimate Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the genotype data of the SLE cases and controls. Significant differences in alleles and genotype frequencies between cases and controls were assessed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by case and control allele frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The p-values <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
