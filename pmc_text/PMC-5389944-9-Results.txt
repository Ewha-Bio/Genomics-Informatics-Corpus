Examples of graph database usage
The graph database provides a flexible search for complex relationships, as well as a fast search for relationships among multiple nodes. We show here two examples of using a graph database. The first is a search for the shortest paths traversing various relationships among connected nodes. For example, exploring the relationship between biological entities that are involved in two biological mechanisms can identify new potential targets for disease treatment and provide better insights into drug administration. The first example is a graph that identifies the shortest path among protein interactions or homologous proteins within three levels of the protein subsets associated with a nuclear receptor (Fig. 8A). It can be seen that the two distinct subsets of proteins belong to a common pathway.
The second example includes flexible extensions and searches of the constructed graph database. When adding a new relationship in the constructed graph database, it is possible to flexibly define and add the relationship, regardless of the structure of the existing graph database. Fig. 8B shows an example of adding a result of a new genetic analysis to the existing graph database and using it for a search. The added information can be easily defined and added without restrictions from the existing graph database structure. In this example, the added information is a node, named ‘classifier,’ which is related to the existing graph database. In contrast, the relational database system is quite inflexible in adding new types of information, because it sometimes requires the redesign of existing tables.
