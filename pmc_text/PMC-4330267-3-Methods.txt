Molecular docking of kir6.2 model with phytochemicals
Molecular docking between kir6.2 models and phytochemicals was accomplished using the AutoDock-4.2 algorithm (http://autodock.scripps.edu/). Kollman united atom charges, solvation parameters, and polar hydrogens were added into the kir6.2 PDB files for the preparation of the protein in the docking simulation. Chemical structures of phytochemicals having anti-diabetic properties were extracted from the Pubchem (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccompound) database of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web server (Supplementary Fig. 1) in SDF format and converted to three-dimensional structures in PDB format using Discovery Studio 3.5. Ligand molecules were prepared by choosing the root and restricting the number of torsion within a minimum range. AutoDock requires precalculated grid maps, one for each atom type present in the flexible molecules being docked, and it stores the potential energy arising from the interaction with rigid macromolecules. One hundred runs of blind dockings were performed for all inhibitors with both the wild-type and mutant protein model of kir6.2. Then next round of docking was performed by setting a grid of 98, 100, and 62 points in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, in the ATP-binding site of kir6.2 [12] for both models by applying the Lamarckian genetic algorithm. The best poses of docking during both rounds were compared and reported with the binding energy reported for each case. The visualization and analysis were performed using Discover Studio 3.5 package.
