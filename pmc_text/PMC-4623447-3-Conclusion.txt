Statistical indices evaluating ecology, such as the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance, are considered important criteria to sustain and restore ecosystems. Although there are a few programs for these indices, some programs are inconvenient to use and do not support various indices. We developed VBioindex, a user-friendly program that is capable of measuring the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance. In addition, VBioindex offers options with which a user can analyze a variety of biodiversity data while applying a time-series analysis. VBioindex outputs a tab-delimited text file with visual charts and users can use the output text file with links to other statistical programs for a variety of ecological studies such as comparative analyses between many datasets. VBioindex is publically accessible at http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbioindex/.
