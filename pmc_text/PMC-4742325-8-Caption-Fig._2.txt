Proportion of variance attributed to each chromosome of three traits of parity 1 against chromosome length. We show proportion of variance of each chromosome, which is significant based on likelihood test (p-value<0.1). (A) Milk yield (slope = 8.05 E-04, S.E = 4.31 E-04, p-value = 8.46 E-02). (B) Milk fat (slope = 5.79 E-04, S.E = 1.84 E-04, p-value = 4.26 E-03). (C) Milk protein (slope = 5.75 E-04, S.E = 2.97 E-04, p-value = 5.24 E-02).
