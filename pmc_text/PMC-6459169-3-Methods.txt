Sample collection and Illumina sequencing
Blood specimens (approximately 1 mL) were collected from one individual of each penguin species on King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica (Table 1). Both species were identified in reference to morphological characteristics and their mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequences. Blood samples were immediately transferred to a vial containing RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at –20°C until RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored in RNAstable (Biometrica, San Diego, CA, USA). The quality and quantity of the total RNA was assessed using the Bioanalyer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). High-quality mRNA (2 µg) was used to generate a double-stranded cDNA library using poly A selection. Entire experimental reagents and equipments were purchased from Illumina Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). The NuGEN Encore Complete RNA-Seq Library System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA, USA) was used to construct paired-end libraries (PE500) of sheared cDNA (500 bp fragments) that were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq System platform (300 × 2 paired-end reads). Index and adaptor sequences were trimmed using Trimmomatic [31] and low-quality reads were removed using the FASTX toolkit [32] with parameters set to-t = 20,-l = 70, and-Q = 33.
