Some polymorphisms such as tandem repeats exist within the regulatory elements
Repeat Masker found several repeats sequences overlapped with regulatory elements of the HOTAIR locus such as CpGIs (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1) and motifs (Supplementary Table 3). Repeat master investigates query sequences and generates a detailed annotation of available repeats in these sequences and shows dispersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). In addition, tandem repeat finder, which analyzes simple tandem repeats, predicted one simple tandem repeat (GAGGGAGGGAGCGAGA) within this gene (Supplementary Table 1) (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) [40]. In addition, we found some simple nucleotide polymorphisms within regulatory sequences of HOTAIR gene (Supplementary Table 4).
