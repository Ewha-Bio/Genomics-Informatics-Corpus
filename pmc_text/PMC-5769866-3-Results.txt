The cohesin complex
Cohesin as a sister chromatid cohesion molecule
Cohesin, a large ring-shaped molecule that can bind DNA strands, is a multi-subunit protein complex composed of two structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) molecules, SMC1 and SMC3, either stromal antigen (STAG) STAG1 or STAG2, and the kleisin subunit RAD21 (Fig. 4) [9]. Cohesin is required to mediate sister chromatid cohesion for proper chromosome segregation in the S phase until cell division [65]. The cohesin complex was also found to be involved in efficient DNA DSB repair [64]. Since cohesin is important for holding sister chromatids together following DNA replication, mutational inactivation of the cohesin complex causes genomic instability and aneuploidy during cell cycle progression in human diseases [11]. For example, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant developmental disorder, is caused by mutation of SMC1, SMC3, Rad21, NIPBL, or HDAC8, which encode core components of the cohesin complex or proteins that interact with this complex [66, 67]. Somatic mutations in the cohesin subunits have also been frequently found in several different human tumor types [68–71].
Cohesin in transcriptional regulation
Although its role in chromatid cohesion during mitosis is well established [65], cohesin was also found to bind thousands of sites on interphase chromosomes [4]. Indeed, cohesin interacts with the Mediator complex, a transcriptional coactivator [72], and co-occupies enhancer and promoter regions with it to regulate tissue-specific gene expression [4]. High-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequence analyses also revealed that cohesin remains bound at the transcription factor-binding sites through replication to facilitate the re-establishment of transcription factor clusters after DNA replication and cell division [12]. This suggests that the cohesin complex acts as a transcriptional regulator in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and development [8].
Colocalization of cohesin with CTCF
CTCF was originally known as a cohesin loading factor [10, 64] because genome-wide studies revealed that cohesin globally colocalizes extensively with CTCF throughout the genome [61, 62, 73]. However, CTCF depletion did not completely impair the entire association of cohesin with chromatin [61, 73–75]. Instead, depletion of CTCF was shown to reduce the enrichment of cohesin at only a small proportion of cohesin-binding sites [61, 74, 75], indicating that CTCF facilitates the distribution of cohesin to specific sites on chromosomes [8]. In contrast, the depletion of RAD21, a core subunit of the cohesin complex [9], does not disrupt the enrichment of CTCF, suggesting that CTCF binding is independent of the presence of cohesin on chromatin [8]. In this context, the following question arises: What is the essential role of cohesin at CTCF-binding sites?
Role of CTCF/cohesin in genome folding
Apart from its major function in sister chromatid cohesion, it has recently been shown that cohesin acts in concert with CTCF to affect higher-order chromosome architecture by forming long-range chromosomal interactions in many developmentally regulated gene families [76]. For example, cohesin has been shown to play a critical role in maintaining CTCF-mediated higher-order chromatin conformation at the β-globin and Igf2/H19 loci [37, 39, 41, 74]. CTCF and cohesin also stabilize the rearrangement of Igh and T-cell receptor loci via long-range chromatin interactions [41, 77, 78].
Although it is not yet clear how CTCF/cohesin mediate chromatin looping, CTCF may first bind between two CTCF sites and form a complex with cohesin through its C-terminal region [60, 79, 80]. Considering the evidence that cohesin can tether DNA molecules together [81], a study appeared to show that cohesin stabilized long-range chromatin interactions by anchoring DNA strands together within a closed ring structure among CTCF/cohesin localization sites [11, 64, 76]. Interestingly, CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin looping preferentially occurs between CTCF sites with convergent CTCF DNA motifs [82]. Thus, inverting one site of convergent CTCF-binding sites changes the chromatin architecture and can alter gene expression [5, 83].
