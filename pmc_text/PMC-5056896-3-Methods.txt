Prediction of structural model of miRNA-mRNA complexes
To verify the folding affinity between selected miRNAs and their target genes, secondary structures were predicted using RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi). The resulted dot bracketed structures of duplex were used for prediction of their tertiary structure using RNA COMPOSER (http://rnacomposer.cs.put poznan.pl/).
