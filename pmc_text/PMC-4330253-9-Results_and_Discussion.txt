Pathway network analysis
The results of the V(G)/V(P) for 100 to 5,000 SNPs were plotted in Fig. 2. When we used 5,000 SNPs, V(G)/V(P) approximated 50%, and we extracted functional SNPs, such as eQTLs and nsSNPs, from the 5,000 SNPs. We could extract 159 eQTLs and 18 nsSNPs among the 5,000 SNPs (Supplementary Table 2). Notably, 6 eQTL genes and 2 nsSNP genes consisted of LPL and the apolipoprotein A-V (APOA5) pathway through the interaction of a number of mediated genes (Table 4). Among them, muscle creatinine kinase (CKM) has been documented to regulate LPL activity [42], demonstrating that it is putatively associated with METS. Those additionally identified genes might be candidate targets of METS for further study (Fig. 3).
eQTLs and nsSNPs provide insights into the regulation of transcription and aid in the interpretation of GWASs [22]. Most of the eQTL resources are available in online databases, such as RegulomeDB (http://regulome.stanford.edu/), including several published resources in various cell types, such as monocytes [43], human brain [44], lymphoblastoid cell lines [45, 46], and human liver [47]. Probably, RegulomeDB is one of the most useful eQTL databases, because it contains rich information about the products of the ENCODE project, such as transcription factor binding sites, chromatin structure, histone modification, and eQTLs. Our pathway results suggest an internal mechanism of LPL, APOA5, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2) functions in METS. Therefore, we suggest that 6 eQTLs and 2 nsSNP loci might be additional targets for further association studies and functional analysis.
Conclusively, our approach using the conventional GWAS, reconsidering functional variants and the pathway-based interpretation, suggests a useful method to understand the GWAS results of complex traits and can be expanded in other GWASs.
