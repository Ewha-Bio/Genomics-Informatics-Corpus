Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The level of statistical significance (p) was calculated with a student's t test or ANOVA test to compare clinical subgroups of transplant patients, such as stable and acute rejection. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were also calculated to compare SNP marker types to detect donor cfDNA. Linkage between highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNP markers were examined with the square of correlation coefficients (r2) using HapAnalyzer program [14].
