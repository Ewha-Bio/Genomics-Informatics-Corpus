The role of tRFs in cancer was first reported by Lee et al3. One of the tRF-1 series (namely tRF-1001), derived from pre-tRNASer, is highly expressed in several cancer cell lines relative to non-proliferating normal tissues, and is required for proliferation of prostate cancer cells [3]. The levels of tRF-1001 in cancer cells are directly related to the degree of cellular proliferation. Knocking down this tRF causes a dramatic loss of cell viability and inhibition of cell proliferation with specific accumulation of cells in G2 phase and inhibition of DNA synthesis [3]. In addition, analysis of the small RNA transcriptome in prostate cancer revealed enrichment of tRFs in both non-metastatic and metastatic lymph node prostate cancer samples [3]. The molecular mechanism by which tRF-1001 affects cell physiology is not known. There may be a differential processing of tRNA in prostate cancer because tRFs in non-metastatic samples were 18 nucleotides long whereas tRFs in metastatic tissues were 27 nucleotides long [49].
The important role of tRFs in controlling cancer is also supported by the observation showing enhanced ANG expression in almost all types of cancer [505152]. Recently, it has been shown that ANG produced tRFs that re-program translation and promote the assembly of stress granules. As these events help cells survive under adverse conditions, it is possible that ANG-induced tRFs may contribute to ANG-mediated cancer cell proliferation [48]. tRFs have also been reported to help cancer cells to prevent apoptosome formation by binding to cytochrome c [53].
