MiR-27a expression level in validation cohort
To further validate the diagnostic value of miR-27a, its expression level was measured in additional plasma samples drawn from 20 patients with gastric cancer and 20 healthy controls. The result of miR-27a expression data obtained from each 15 patients with gastric cancer and healthy control plasma samples used in screening cohort were also included in the validation cohort, because of limited sample size. The qRT-PCR results revealed that the miR-27a expression level was highly elevated in the neoplastic group (p = 0.009) (Fig. 3A). In both early (I and II) and late stages (III and IV), the miR-27a expression levels were significantly higher in the group with gastric cancer (Fig. 3B). By ROC analysis, we observed the AUC value to be 0.70 with 75% sensitivity and 56% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer based on the cut-off value of 0.031 for miR-27a expression level in plasma (Fig. 3C). Our results suggest that the plasma miR-27a expression level may have potential as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for gastric cancer.
