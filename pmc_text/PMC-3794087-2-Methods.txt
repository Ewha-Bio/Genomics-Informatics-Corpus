Bioinformatic analysis
To identify SVA consensus sequences in the human genome, we obtained SVA sequences from the Giri database (http://www.girinst.org). The SVA subfamilies were aligned using the BioEdit program [20]. Then, we identified SVAs in each region. RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and the UCSC genome site (http://genome.ucsc.edu) were employed to analyze isoform structures of functional genes. The human expressed sequence tag and RefSeq mRNA were also used to identify alternatively spliced transcripts. The expression pattern of SVA fusion genes in normal human tissues was analyzed using GeneCard (http://www.genecards.org). We obtained microarray data from the BioGPS database, and then we generated a heatmap according to microarray values. High expression levels were indicated by brighter color, and low expression levels were indicated by darker color.
