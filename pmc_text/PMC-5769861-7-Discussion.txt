IVAG is an easy-to-use, web-based application with three modules, including RNA-seq, GWAS, and a genome browser. This application enables scientists with little computational proficiency to analyze and visualize their data easily. Some web applications provide similar functions for RNA-seq and GWAS, but they have some limitations. For example, DEApp [17] provides differential expression analysis using three different methods—edgeR, limma-voom, and DESeq2—while a heatmap or a principal component analysis plot is not provided. START [18] can output several plots, but it does not offer a GO enrichment analysis function. LocusTrack [19] can visualize GWAS data and annotate multiple tracks on them, but it is limited to only one species, human. Zbrowse [20] can be used over every species. However, because it focuses on plotting multiple GWAS results in one panel to enable users to detect genotype-environment interactions, the number of markers that can be plotted for one trait is limited to 5,000. IVAG is not limited to a specific organism or the number of markers [14]. Most importantly, IVAG combines a genome browser with analysis and visualization modules so that users can analyze, visualize, and finally navigate their entire data interactively in one application. We offer only two analysis and visualization modules now, but several more modules are in development and will be included in the near future.
