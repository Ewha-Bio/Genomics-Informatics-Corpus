RMR and BMR measurements
RMR was measured using a MedGem metabolic analyzer (Microlife USA, Dunedin, FL, USA) [16]. This device is a handheld indirect calorimeter used for its accuracy and portability in clinical settings and is becoming popular in research studies as a screening tool and a criterion measure of RMR. This device calculates RMR using florescent quenching of ruthenium in the presence of oxygen and the modified Weir equation, with an assumed respiration quotient of 0.85 to estimate carbon dioxide production [17].
Prior to each measurement, the MedGem was autocalibrated on zero airflow according to the manufacturer's instructions. Participants rested in the supine position on a dormitory bed with a pillow for 15 min in a climate-controlled laboratory, where lights were dimmed and the setting was quiet. Following this rest period, participants were asked to breathe through a mouthpiece in a relaxed fashion for approximately 7-10 min, depending on the stability of the VO2 measures. The participants were allowed to hold the mouthpiece in their mouth during the measurement if they felt it necessary. Once the participant had reached steady-state oxygen consumption, as measured by the MedGem, data collection was completed. If the children were unable to reach steady-state oxygen consumption in the allotted time of approximately 10 min, the test was terminated at 10 min by the device, and RMR was calculated as a mathematical average from the final 8 min of data collection. The MedGem then calculated steady-state RMR for a 24-h period (kcal/day) [13]. BMR was measured using indirect calorimetry. All measurements were repeated three times.
