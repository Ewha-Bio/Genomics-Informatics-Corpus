Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM Na4P2O7, 100 nM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor (1 µg/µL of aprotinin, 1 µg/µL of leupeptin, and 1 mM of PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich). After determination of protein concentrations, equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-HNF-1β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, San Diego, CA, USA) at 4℃. After 8 h, the membranes were probed with secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemi-luminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
