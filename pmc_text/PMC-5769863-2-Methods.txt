All gene expression values in this work were gathered from TCGA. Eligible patients had complete clinical data and a gene expression dataset of breast cancer cells and matched normal cells. Eventually, we retrieved the gene expression values of tumor and matched normal cells of 96 patients. The distribution of their ages is shown in Fig. 1. The values for gene expression level that we used were generated by the Illumina Hi-Seq platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and normalized by root square error methods [17]. All subsequent statistical analyses were carried out using R, version 3.2.3. SVM classifiers were constructed using the e1071 package of R, and a simple linear kernel was used. Functional enrichment analysis of gene classes was performed in ToppGene Suite [18].
Young patients were defined as ≤45 years of age, and elderly patients were defined as those ≥60 years of age (Fig. 1). The rest of the patients were defined as “intermediate.” The statistical significance of differential expression between tumor and matched normal cells was determined by paired t test, based on a p-value threshold of 8.48 × 10−7. The threshold value was set based on the Bonferroni correction, because a test was performed for each age group, and three age groups were defined for each of the 19,646 genes.
