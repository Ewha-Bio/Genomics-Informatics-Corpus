Blood pressure in siRNA-injected mice
Blood pressure was measured 24 h after tail vein injection of the scrambled or Casz1 siRNA (control, n = 4; case, n = 3). Using an intraarterial catheter that was connected to a pressure sensor, we recorded blood pressure continuously for 2 h after anesthesia. Blood pressure did not change after a 1-time injection (p = 0.713). Thus, we injected siRNA twice each day (control, n = 4; case, n = 6) but did not observe any significant difference between the case and control groups (p = 0.545). After 3 siRNA injections daily for 3 days, blood pressure was also unaffected (p = 0.297) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).
