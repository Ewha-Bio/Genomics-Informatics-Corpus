Rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms
dbSNP152 was downloaded from the dbSNP database through ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/snp/ to obtain information about rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Rare SNPs were retrieved after excluding indels, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of > 0.01, and SNPs without information about the MAF. The selected rare SNPs were mapped onto the intronic sequences filtered by the criteria described above. A total of 4,128,907 rare SNPs were mapped onto the filtered introns, of which 1,417,251 (34%) were mapped onto the first introns, whereas 505,637 SNPs were mapped onto the 2-kb upstream regions of genes with repeats masked.
