Principal component analysis
PCA is one of the most common statistical approaches to data dimension reduction [9]. It basically transforms multiple variables to have orthogonality so the first principal component can be expressed as a weighted linear combination of variables. The weights of the first component are computed such that the component can account for the greatest possible variance of multiple variables. In case-control association studies of genomic data with a group structure, we can apply PCA for each gene or genetic region, where data information of multiple genetic sites within the same gene or genetic region can be reduced to a single numerical vector corresponding to the first principal component. Then, a phenotypic association of the principal component can be tested based on the independent two sample T-test. Statistical approaches based on PCA have been widely applied to analysis of high-dimensional genomic data [101112].
