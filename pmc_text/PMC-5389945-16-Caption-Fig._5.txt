Change in donor DNA percentage over time after transplantation is presented for three representative patients. Urine (left) and plasma (right) donor-specific cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) were expressed as percentage of the total cfDNA. The legends show details about the conditions of the patient, such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute cellular rejection (ACR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), or borderline. The grades of rejection (IA, IIA) and creatinine levels (Cr) were also presented in the Figure.
