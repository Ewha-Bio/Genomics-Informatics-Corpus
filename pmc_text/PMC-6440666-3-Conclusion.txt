In this paper, we introduced recent progress with our previously developed method. While there were several advantages of the proposed method, limited accessibility of the implementation of the program has hindered the utilization of the PHARAOH method so far. However, we successfully showed that a combination of a well-developed workbench that covers the limitation of the method can improve its accessibility to researchers, through our integration of the PHARAOH method and the WISARD framework.
