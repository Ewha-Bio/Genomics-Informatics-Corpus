Network analysis
Based on all identified genes, new and expanded pathway maps and connections and specific gene-gene interactions were inferred, functionally analyzed, and used to build on the existing pathway using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) knowledge base [57].
To generate networks in this work, the knowledge base was queried for interactions between the identified genes and all other genes stored in the database. Four networks were found to be significant in OSCC. The network with the highest score (Network 1, score = 36) was generated, with 17 identified genes (Table 7, Fig. 3).
In the network diagram, STAT1 and SOD2 neighbored with NMI and AURKA, respectively. The expression levels of STAT1 and SOD2 could be expected to be related with those of NMI and SOD2. Actually, the expressions of STAT1 and SOD2 were strongly positively correlated with NMI (r = 0.95) and AURKA (r = 0.87), respectively.
