Detection of LOH and SCNA by SCHALE
Detection LOH and SCNA was performed with custom-made software SCHALE (Fig. 2). For the positions where the genotypes were heterozygous in normal samples, the values of LOH and SCNA were calculated. The values of LOH were calculated by the equation:
LOH = | RT - 0.5 | - | RN - 0.5 |, where RN is the count of reads supporting a non-reference allele divided by the total depth in the normal sample and RT is in tumor sample. The values of SCNA were calculated by the equation:
SCNA = log2(tumor depth/normal depth), where the depths were normalized using R library tweeDEseq. The values of LOH and SCNA were segmented together using R library DNAcopy with the parameters alpha = 0.01 and undo.SD = 2. The segments and values were plotted for each chromosome with the idiograms in R library SNPchip.
