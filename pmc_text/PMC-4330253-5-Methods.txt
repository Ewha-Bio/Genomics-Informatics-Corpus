Statistical analysis
The GWAS for METS cases and controls was conducted by logistic regression analysis, adjusting for residential area, sex, age, and BMI as covariates, implemented in PLINK version 1.07 [18]. The significant associations were defined by genomewide significance level p-values (<5 × 10-8) and genome-wide suggestive p-values (5 × 10-8 ≤ p < 1 × 10-5).
The LD between the previously reported GWAS SNPs and the SNPs of the current GWAS was investigated with SNAP web-based software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap) and GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/). For example, we entered our top significant SNPs in the SNAP input panel and found high LD SNPs with r2 > 0.9 and D' = 1 around 1 Mbp. The high-LD SNPs were investigated in the GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwasstudies) as to whether they were previously reported or not.
To maximize the candidate risk factors of METS, we selected additional functional SNPs in the eQTLs or nsSNP loci (5 × 10-5 ≤ p < 1 × 10-4). Among the Affymetrix 5.0 SNPs, we investigated the eQTL SNPs from regulomeDB (http://regulomedb.org) and the nsSNPs from BioMart (http://www.biomart.org).
The genetic variances of the top association SNPs were estimated by GCTA v1.24 [16], which is a tool for estimating the proportion [V(G)/V(P)] of phenotypic variance [V(P)] explained by SNPs [V(G)] for complex traits. We selected the SNP sets based on the GWAS p-values from 100 to 1,000 SNPs with 10-SNP intervals and from 1,000 to 5,000 SNPs with 1,000-SNP intervals. We decided the number of SNPs in the maximum set based on the genetic variance approximated the METS heritability reported from the Korean twin study [5]. The pair-wise genetic relationships were estimated using the make-grm option, and the proportion of the phenotypic variance explained by the associated SNPs was estimated by the grm-test option with the restricted maximum likelihood [11].
