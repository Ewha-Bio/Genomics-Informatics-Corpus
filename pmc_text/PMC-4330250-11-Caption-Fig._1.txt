Pipeline for this study. First, next-generation sequencing raw data (fastq) are aligned using Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program (GSNAP), and then, the reads without bad mapping quality are selected. In addition, significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are learned from the genome-wide association study results, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) ranges with the SNPs are searched by HaploView. Using Samtools, reads within the LD ranges are selected and phased. As a result, a haplotype catalog can be constructed, including haplotypes with significant SNPs.
