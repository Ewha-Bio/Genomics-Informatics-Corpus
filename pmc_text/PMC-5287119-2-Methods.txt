The KARE cohort
The KARE project started in 2007 and recruited 10,000 participants aged between 49 to 60 years from Ansung and Ansan, in the Gyeonggi Province of South Korea. About 50 million autosomal SNPs were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP arrary 5.0 [14]. In total, 8,842 individuals with 352,228 SNPs are available. In our GWASs, we discarded SNPs for which the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p-values were less than 10â€“5, the genotype calling rates were less than 95%, and the minor allele frequencies were less than 0.05. We also eliminated subjects with gender inconsistencies, those whose identity by state was more than 0.8, and those whose calling rates were less than 95%. As a result, we analyzed 8,773 participants (4,117 males and 4,656 females) with 304,245 SNPs.
