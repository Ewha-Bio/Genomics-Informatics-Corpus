DNA-binding activity of the wild-type and HNF-1β mutants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done with oligonucleotide probes of the human GLUT2 promoter: 5'-AAG ACC TCA GTA AAG ATT AAC CAT CAT TA-3'. The probe was incubated with nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA, wild-type, and two HNF1B mutants. (A) The proteins of HNF-1β were detected by Western blot. (B) EMSA shows that wild-type HNF-1β is binding to the GLUT2 promoter, but mutants are not. WT, wild-type; FP, fluorescence polarization; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HNF-1β, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β; GLUT2, glucose transporter type 2.
