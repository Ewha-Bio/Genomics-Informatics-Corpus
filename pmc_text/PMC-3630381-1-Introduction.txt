The Human Genome Project was started in 1990 and completed by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium in April 2003 [1]. Even though the human whole genome sequencing was one of the biggest achievements in human genetics, still more remains to be done. In September 2003, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched an international research group called Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) to identify all functional regulatory regions across the entire human genome [2]. For this project, an international group of 442 members from 32 institutions studied 147 different types of cells with 24 types of different experiments (http://www.genome.gov/ENCODE) [3, 4]. The ENCODE project consists of a pilot and a technology development phase [5]. Methods used for the first phase were mainly chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and quantitative PCR. A set of regions, corresponding to 30,000 kilobases (~1% of whole human genome), have been targeted [6]. The studies highlighted the success on characterizing functional elements in the human genome and were published in June 2007 in Nature [6] and Genome Research [7]. In the second phase of this project, several new advanced technologies were employed to gain higher accuracy and increase coverage. The key technology was so-called next-generation sequencing. Many software tools were developed within the ENCODE project, such as Clustered Aggregation Tool (CAGT) [8]. This tool has been applied to the datasets of chromatin marks and transcription factors to generate a comprehensive archive of histone modifications and nucleosome positioning around transcription factor binding sites. On September 5, 2012, the results of the ENCODE studies were published in 30 papers in Nature, Genome Research, and Genome Biology to express 5 years of progress toward the goal of the project [9]. The subjects of the ENCODE project to date include:
- Transcription factor motifs
- Chromatin patterns at transcription factor binding sites
- Characterization of intergenic regions and gene definition
- RNA and chromatin modification patterns around promoters
- Epigenetic regulation of RNA processing
- Noncoding RNA characterization
- DNA methylation patterns
- Enhancer discovery and characterization
- Three-dimensional connections across the genome
- Characterization of network topology
- Machine learning approaches to genomics
- Impact of functional information on understanding variation
- Impact of evolutionary selection on functional regions
