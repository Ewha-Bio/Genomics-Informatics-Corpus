Stringency of whole-genome DNA shotgun sequencing for novel genome. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing (left of the Figure) for contig construction: Sequencing of single-end or paired-end fragment of whole-genome DNA shotgun library, which are made with the average range of 200-800-bp fragments for Roche/454 or Illumina/Solexa systems. In general, producing a total DNA sequence amount of 15-20× and 60× coverage in depth of a genome depends on using Roche/454 or Illumina/Solexa, respectively. Whole-genome shotgun mate paired-end sequencing for scaffold construction (right of the Figure): sequencing of the mate paired-end fragments of the whole-genome DNA shotgun library, which are made with the average range of 2-40-Kb fragments for next-generation DNA sequencer. The sequencing amount of more than 20× coverage in depth of the genome is effective for scaffold constructions.
