The conserved amino acid residues within left-handed parallel beta helix (LbH) domain of lpxD protein between Bordetella petrii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB ID: 3PMO, Chain A) are identified and deciphered (A). The structural super imposition between identified drug target lpxD (red color) of B. petrii and template (PDB ID: 3pmo, Chain A) (blue color) of P. aeruginosa represented (B). The backbone folding pattern was studied through phi and psi torsion angle in Ramachandran plot represented (C). The overall model quality evaluated and deciphered (D), where the black dot in the plot represents for predicted structural model of lpxD, falls within the range of X-ray and NMR model quality. The errors within the non-bonded interaction plotted (E), the amino acid residues and percentage of error represented in X-axis and Y-axis respectively, the deep black color represents error regions in corresponding amino acid residues during non-bonded interaction.
