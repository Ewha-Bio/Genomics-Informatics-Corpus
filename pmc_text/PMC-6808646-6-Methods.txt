Design of the custom-made Affymetrix GeneChip
For the microarray experiments, two versions of Affymetrix GeneChips with 11 µm features were custom-made by Affymetrix, “Affy-KRIBB SP1 (Part No. 520429)” and “Affy-KRIBB SP2 (Part No. 520506),” by following the guidelines of the GeneChip CustomExpress Array Program.
Ideally, the first version (array format 100-3660) could represent 4,800 different probes by 11 probe pairs (perfect match and mismatch) with a maximum capacity of 100,000 (100K ≅ 4,800 × ×22). As the required features for the ~10,000 tag probe pairs in question (5,000 up-tags + 5,000 down-tags) exceeded 220K (10,000 × 22), the first version of the array was modified to represent 47,721 probe pairs in three separate sectors, consisting of 43,721 probe pairs (~10,000 tags in triplicate or quadruplicate, positive controls included) and a single set of 4,000 unique negative controls, resulting in 91K features (43,721 × 2 + 4,000) as shown in the left diagram in Fig. 2A. The second version (array format 400) was made to represent 48,201 features (48K), consisting of 41,169 probes for 10,292 tags in quadruplicate (~5,000 up-tags + ~5,000 down-tags) without mismatch pairs, 1,508 negative controls in quadruplicate, and a single set of 1,000 unique negative controls (~10,000 × 4 + 1,508 × 4 + 1,000) at randomly dispersed positions without separate sectors, as shown in the right diagram in Fig. 2A.
For tiling sense-strand probes on arrays, specific files containing the information about the total probes were generated in Excel spreadsheets, following the guidelines suggested by Affymetrix. Sequence information about each probe was represented in the sense strands by seven-digit numbers (Fig. 2B).
