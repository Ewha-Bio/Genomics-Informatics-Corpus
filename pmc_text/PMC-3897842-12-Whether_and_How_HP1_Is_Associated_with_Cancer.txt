HP1 depletion activates DDRs
Recent studies have revealed the possible link of HP1 proteins to the DDR [59, 65, 66]. However, the spatial and temporal regulation of the association and dissociation of HP1 with chromatin in response to DNA damage remains unclear and controversial. A couple of studies have reported that DNA damage induces the transient dissociation of inhibitory HP1 proteins from DNA damage sites in order to help DNA repair proteins/complexes gain access to chromatin [65, 66]. In contrast, another study has indicated that HP1 is recruited and associates at DNA damage sites, such as UV-induced DNA lesions and chromosomal breaks upon DNA damage, which helps the DDR via its dynamic dissociation and association with DNA damage sites [59]. Recently, Lee and colleagues [67] have shown that HP1 promotes homologous recombination repair via recruitment of BRCA1 to damaged chromatin. Together, chromatin protein HP1 plays some unelucidated roles in keeping genomic as well as epigenomic integrity.
