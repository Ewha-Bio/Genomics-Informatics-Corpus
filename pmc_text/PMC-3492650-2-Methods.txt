The FAIRE-chip data, covering human chromosomes 8, 11, and 12, derived from MCF-7 cell lines, were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE11579) [23]. The ChIP-Seq data (SRA045635) of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/14ac, and input DNA (mononucleosome digested with micrococcal nuclease) in MCF-7 were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at the National Center for Biotechnical Information (NCBI) [26]. The H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq data were generated with Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to the method described by Choe et al. [26]. The gene expression data using the Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 array platform (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) were collected from the GEO database (GSM276046-GSM276048 for MCF-7) [27].
