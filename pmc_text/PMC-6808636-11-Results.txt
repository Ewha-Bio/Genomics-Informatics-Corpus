Allele frequency association test between the two cohorts
Next, we performed a GWAS to detect genomic variants that showed significant differences in the MAF between the two cohorts. In the original study, the WTCCC performed a similar test to check differences in the allele frequencies between the 58C and UKBS cohorts using genome-wide scans. In that analysis, they stratified the samples based on their broad geographical origin (12 UK regions). The result of the test statistics in a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot indicated that there were no significant differences between the two control groups. They showed that their samples did not show a clear population structure in multidimensional scaling and PCA plots, despite the 12 different origins of the samples.
Our association analysis was similar to the analysis in the original paper, but different in that we included the top 20 PCs as covariates instead of performing a stratified analysis based on 12 geographical regions. The reason for this difference is that the geographical origin information was not readily available for download from the WTCCC website. To our knowledge, only the genotype data and the disease status were publicly available to researchers. Thus, in general, a researcher using the WTCCC controls would likely use only PCs as covariates instead of geographical information. Moreover, even if a researcher were to obtain the geographical region information for the WTCCC controls, it would not possible to use this information as a covariate in the case/control analysis without having the same information for cases. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine the differences between the two control cohorts in an analysis using only PCs as covariates.
Specifically, we tested the MAF difference between the two cohorts using logistic regression, while including the top 20 PCs as covariates to account for regional differences in the samples. To this end, we set one cohort as cases (58C) and another cohort as controls (UKBS). We then performed association tests to identify the associations between SNPs and the cohort identifier. Fig. 3A shows the Manhattan plot of associations. We did not find any loci that exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance of 5.7 × 10-7 (red line), which was the threshold used in the WTCCC study. This is unsurprising because the dataset we used was already filtered to remove any SNPs with p < 5.7 × 10-7 in the MAF difference test of the original study. However, we could find several loci with moderate significance (p < 1 × 10-5, blue line). Fig. 3B demonstrates that the association tests had slight inflation (genomic control inflation factor [λ]: 1.04). Upon visual inspection, the Q-Q plot appeared slightly more inflated in our analysis than the Q-Q plot presented in the original paper (Fig. 3B of the WTCCC study [4]), possibly because the exact regional information was not included in the analysis. An exact comparison of inflation was not possible because the result of the inflation statistic in the original study was not available.
