Whether and how HP1 is related to cancer
An aberrant epigenome in cancer cells results from an altered chromatin structure resulting from alterations in chromatin-modifying enzymes and/or chromatin proteins. Examples of HP1γ-interacting proteins are the histone proteins, epigenetic modifiers, transcription factor family, DNA repair factors, and replication proteins (Fig. 5) [48, 54-57, 60, 62, 63, 67-80]. The diversity of HP1γ-associated proteins has increased with the recent discovery that HP1γ interacts with BRCA1, a tumor suppressor that guards the genome. In addition, HP1γ is involved in the recovery of BRCA1-mediated transcription post-DDR. There is no direct evidence that HP1γ is a component of BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. However, a couple of tantalizing observations support this possibility: HP1γ expression is elevated in prostate cancer [81], and in addition, depletion of HP1 paralogs activates the formation of DNA damage repair foci. HP1 paralogsare recruited to repair foci and promote DNA repair, following DNA damage. This raises the question of whether increased or decreased HP1γ can foster or suppress tumor initiation and development. In light of the HP1γ-BRCA1 association, it would be intriguing to test whether the genes encoding the HP1 family are also overexpressed in breast cancers. It would also be interesting to test whether the HP1 family impinges on genomic stability.
