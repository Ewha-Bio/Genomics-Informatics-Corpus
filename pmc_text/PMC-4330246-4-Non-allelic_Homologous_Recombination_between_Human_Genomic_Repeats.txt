High-copy repeats in CNV instability
The genomic repeats representing DNA primary structures can be divided into LCR/SD and high-copy repeats. Compared to LCR/SD, high-copy repeats constitute a great portion of the human genome. Interspersed repeats are the most common type of high-copy repeats, which cover over 44% of the human genome [35]. One of the major classes of interspersed repeats is the retrotransposon, including short interspersed elements (SINEs), long interspersed elements (LINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).
SINEs are short DNA sequences (100-400 bp in length) with an internal (mobile) polymerase III promoter [15], making up about 11% of the human genome [36]. The most common SINEs are Alu elements, which burst out in the evolution of primates [37]. Moreover, Alu elements play an important role in disease, such as breast cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, familial hypercholesterolemia, and so on [38]. In 2008, Kim et al. [22] found a strong association between Alu elements and old SDs. By means of NAHR, Alu elements contribute to the formation of CNVs, especially deletions [39, 40, 41, 42, 43].
The most classic repeats in LINEs are the LINE-1 (L1) elements, which are 6-8 kb in length [44]. Covering about 17% of the human genome, L1 elements can elevate genomic instability, provide resources for NAHR [39, 40, 41, 45, 46], and cause human diseases [47, 48, 49, 50].
In the human genome, there exist at least 50,000 copies of ERVs [51], which are defined as human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), covering about 4.9% of human DNA sequences [21]. Via the NAHR mechanism, HERVs were found to induce large deletions and cause hypotonia and motor, language, and cognitive delays [52, 53]. Intriguingly, a series of studies show that there is a strong association between HERVs and CNVs in the region of AZFa, a well-known locus related to male infertility [54, 55, 56, 57].
