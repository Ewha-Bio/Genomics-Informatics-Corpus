Genomics & Informatics is the official journal of the Korea Genome Organization. The prototype version of the full-text corpus of Genomics & Informatics has recently been archived in the GitHub repository as GNI version 1.0 [1,2]. As of July, 2018, 499 part-of-speechâ€“tagged full-text articles are available as a corpus resource. Now that the prototype GNI corpus has been constructed, we can obtain basic descriptive statistics. The most basic statistical measure is a frequency count, a simple tallying of the number of instances of something that occurs in a corpus [3].
Ensuring the validity of statistical conclusions involves using adequate sampling procedures and reliable measurement procedures. Issues of validity and reliability occur when the sample size of the study is too small given other factors. Still, the publications in Genomics & Informatics contain a substantial subset of scientific knowledge. Analyzing data from publication databases helps us understand how this knowledge is obtained and how it changes over time. For example, by comparing the empirical data on the popularity of genes analyzed in each volume, we might detect noteworthy publication patterns of a journal.
In this study, we present the temporal dynamics of the most-studied genes as a reflection of the scientific content of Genomics & Informatics. We also discuss article categories and present word clouds of articles published in Genomics & Informatics, using a shallow neural network and K-means clustering.
