Pathway-based analysis
Pathway analysis was conducted using MAGENTA (http://broadinstitute.org/mpg/magenta) to discover biological pathways or gene sets associated with MetS. Detailed information on this analysis is described by Segre et al. [27]. Briefly, the steps of MAGENTA analysis were as follows: 1) SNP association p-values and chromosome positions from the GWAS are used as input; 2) each gene located at a predetermined boundary is mapped to a single SNP; 3) based on the regional SNP p-values, gene scores are ranked, and the best SNP p-values are determined; 4) gene scores are corrected for confounding factors, such as gene size and linkage disequilibrium-related properties; and 5) gene set enrichment p-values are determined by analyzing the gene sets enriched with highly ranked gene scores and the selected biological pathway or gene sets [27]. False discovery rate (FDR) was also identified through multiple test correction. Additional information, including 95th and 75th percentile cutoffs and the number of observed and expected genes within each pathway, were also calculated. Since 75th percentile cutoffs have greater power in interpreting complex diseases that are highly polygenic, this cutoff value was used for our interpretation [27, 29, 33].
