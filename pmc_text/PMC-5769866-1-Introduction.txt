Genomes form higher-order chromatin structures during cellular development and differentiation [1–4]. The spatial folding of chromosomes and their organization in the nucleus have profound effects on gene expression [5, 6]. It is now well established that chromosomal architecture is largely mediated by the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin complex [7, 8]. CTCF, a zinc finger DNA-binding protein that functions in transcriptional repression, activation, and as an insulator that interferes with enhancer–promoter interactions [9], is needed for the recruitment of cohesin to chromatin [10]. In addition to its major influence on sister chromatid cohesion [11], cohesin affects gene transcription by facilitating long-range interactions between members of many developmentally regulated gene families [12–14].
Interphase chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are subdivided into evolutionarily conserved topologically associated domains (TADs) in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus (Fig. 1) [15, 16]. TADs are defined as self-associating chromosome segments enclosed by a chromatin loop in the megabase range detected by Hi-C methods [17]. TADs show a high frequency of interactions within domains and a low frequency of interactions among different domains [15, 17]. They are partitioned into several subcompartments related to their gene expression patterns and maintained across cell types, suggesting that TADs shape the regulatory landscape of the genome during development [6, 15, 16]. Interestingly, in the boundaries of TADs, there is an abundance of the architectural protein CTCF and cohesin [6, 15], suggesting that these proteins have a role in establishing the topological boundaries [17].
Increasing evidence from recent studies has indicated that genomic instability is spatially related to higher-order chromatin organization in cancer cells [18]. Previous studies of c-Myc, BCL, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) (the most common translocation partners in various B-cell lymphomas) showed that these loci are preferentially localized in close spatial juxtaposition to each other in normal B cells [19, 20]. Moreover, the boundaries of copy-number alterations are preferentially localized in close spatial juxtaposition within the nucleus [21–23]. Thus, the continuous DNA damage and subsequent defective repair near double-strand break (DSB) sites might generate copy-number alterations of oncogenes during tumorigenesis [24, 25]. In addition, the recent discovery that DSBs and subsequent amplification of estrogen response elements can be generated by estrogen-induced long-range chromatin interactions in breast cancer [26] further indicates the importance of higher-order genome architecture for chromosomal rearrangement. Therefore, the close spatial proximity of genomic regions may provide an opportunity for the formation of specific, cancer-related chromosomal translocation events during tumor development [18, 27, 28].
Here, we briefly review recent works on the roles of CTCF and cohesin in genome folding, their global impact on gene expression, and their association with human disease.
