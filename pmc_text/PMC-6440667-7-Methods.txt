Prediction model design by machine learning tools
For the nonobese population (BMI < 25 kg/m2) population, the clinical information (age, sex, BMI, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, and exercise) and SNPs selected as described above (finally, 10 SNPs were selected: rs3764261, rs247617, rs2266788, rs964184, rs10830963, rs1260326, rs10830962, rs1883025, rs1919128, and rs11757661) were used to perform five types of machine learning analysis, multilayer perceptron (MLP) [28], naÃ¯ve Bayes classification (NB) [29], random forest classification (RF) [30], decision trees classification (J48) [31], and support vector machine classification (SVM) [32], to predict metabolic syndrome. The additive model was used for genotype data used. The total population was divided into sets in a 7:3 ratio for the training set, which was used to develop the model, relative to the test set, which was used to validate the resulting model. The performance of the model was evaluated according to accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1 score, and the balanced classification rate. Model A was designed with only clinical information, and model B also included genetic information (information about the 10 SNPs). The machine learning analysis was conducted by Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis; University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand). All analyses were two-tailed, and p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical tests were performed using PLINK version 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2), R statistical software (version 3.4.4) was used for statistical analyses, and p-values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The study outline is demonstrated in Fig. 1.
