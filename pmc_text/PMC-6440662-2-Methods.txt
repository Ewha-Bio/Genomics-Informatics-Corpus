The computational algorithm used for this study has been illustrated in Fig. 1. The entire work scheme has been divided into three phases namely, phase I, II and III. Phase I involves the characterization and sequence retrieval of the HPs, following the analysis of the S. flexneri genome. Phase II comprises of the annotation of various functional parameters using well optimized series of tools. The probable functions of the characterized HPs were predicted by the integration of various functional predictions. In phase III, an approach was made for systematic performance evaluation of various bioinformatics tools used in this study. In this case, S. flexneri protein sequences with known function were used as control. Finally, expert knowledge was applied for annotation of HPs at a considerable degree of confidence.
