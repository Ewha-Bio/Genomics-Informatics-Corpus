De novo assembly, functional annotation, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis
The raw data were quality-filtered using trimmomatic with the following options: minimum quality of base (3); sliding window (4); average quality phred score (20); and minimum read size (50 bp). The primer and adapter sequences incorporated during cDNA synthesis were removed. The de novo assembly of the reads was performed using Trinity assembler with the default options to form the contigs. Based on the final transcriptome isoform sequences, the candidate-coding regions were identified using TransDecoder software (The Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA). A BLAST analysis was carried out using these candidate-coding regions against the UniProt and NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein databases to determine the sequence similarity with genes from other species at an E-value cut-off of 1 × 10−6. The functional categories of these sequences were matched to the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) algorithms using blast. The GO analysis, including the biological function, cell component and molecular function categories, and the KEGG pathway analysis were performed using the GOstats program (Roswell Park Center Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA) as implemented in the sequence annotation tool Blast2GO (BioBam Bioinformatics SL, Valencia, Spain). The gene annotation and GO analysis were performed at NICEM, Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea). The assembled data were arranged according to the read length, GenBank number, E-value and species, and the specific composition of the GO terms was calculated and presented in a bar chart according to the percentage.
