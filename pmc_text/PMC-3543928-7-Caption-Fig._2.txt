Illustration of data clustering and filtering by QCanvas. The microarray data for 20 selected genes in five cancer samples were used for this demonstration. Red represents up-regulated gene expression, and green represents down-regulated gene expression. The scale is log2 (fold-change). (A) Input matrix data are visualized using a heatmap. (B) The clustering of both cancer samples and genes is interactively carried out using the graphical user interface. (C) The selective display of genes with high or low expression in cancer samples (2-fold changes). (D) The selective display of genes with significant changes (p < 0.01).
