Detection of total positive DNA counts (A) and donor DNA % (B) in urine cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid samples using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-identification. Patients are grouped based on clinical condition as indicated along the x-axis. The “Others” group includes two injured patients (▼), one patient with calcineurin inhibitor toxicity (▲) and one patient with glomerulonephritis (◆). The donor DNA counts were detected by SNP-based dPCR using an autosomal SNP or a sex-specific SNP as described in the Methods. Mean values are indicated with horizontal bar in each group. No significance of the difference between the mean total positive DNA counts for the stable group and acute rejection group was observed by a student's t test (A).
