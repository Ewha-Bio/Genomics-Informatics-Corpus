Colony PCR and DNA sequencing
All barcode regions were amplified by colony PCR and subjected to Sanger sequencing. Up-tag or down-tag regions were amplified using a pair of cp5 and N1 primers or C1 and cp3 primers and sequenced using N10 or C3 as a sequencing primer, respectively (Fig. 1D). The gene-specific cp5 or cp3 primer was designed to be located approximately 500 bp from the insertion sites of the deletion cassettes. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: N1 5ˊ-CGTCTGTGAGGGGAGCGTTT-3ˊ, C1 5ˊ-TGATTTTGATGACGAGCGTAAT-3ˊ, N10 5ˊ-GATGTGAGAACTGTATCCTAGCAAG-3ˊ, C3 5ˊ-GGCTGGCCTGTTGAACAAGTCTGGA-3ˊ. Sequencing was performed by SolGent Co. (Daejeon, Korea).
