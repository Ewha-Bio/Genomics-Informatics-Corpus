Gene prediction and protein domain search
From the downloaded DNA sequences, genes were predicted with the GeneMark suite [4]. The input sequences were split into 20-kb batches, and GeneMark was run for each batch with the default settings. The predicted genes were translated into protein sequences, which were then scanned for the Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) domain using Reverse Position Specific (RPS)-BLAST. COG is a microbial domain database distributed by NCBI. RPS-BLAST is one of the BLAST applications distributed by NCBI and uses position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) as the target database [5]. We looked for hits of the accession COG3344 (PSSM ID: 225881), which stands for "Retron-type reverse transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, transposons)."
