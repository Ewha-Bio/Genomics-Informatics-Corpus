Comparison of the gene scores calculated by two different schemes. All 15,829 genes that were mapped by at least two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (either genotyped or imputed) were included in the high-volume scatter plot that displays the local density of points by a false color representation. For a given gene, the p-values of SNPs located inside or within 20 kb of the gene boundary were surveyed. The best (or second-best) of their-log-transformed values was assigned as the gene score. The X and Y axes represent the second-best and best values, respectively.
