An overall workflow of the updated PHARAOH program is depicted in Fig. 1. Following the implementation of the WISARD framework, the program retrieves genotypes from a given dataset and additional files (phenotype, covariates, gene and pathway mapping) through the WISARD framework. The program now accepts four mainstream genotype formats (PLINK PED, transposed PED, long-format GEN, and Variant Call Format [VCF]), through integration of the WISARD framework.
Next, the program computes given quality control measures and then filters samples and variants based on the criteria. In this step, more than 30 options can be applied to generate various quality control measures and filters based on those measures. Details on the measures can be found at the WISARD website (http://statgen.snu.ac.kr/wisard/). Moreover, we also implemented PHARAOH-specific quality control measures in addition to the WISARD measures, for filtering of unqualified genes or pathways.
After fixation of the dataset, the analysis can be done in a multithreaded way. Multithreading was applied to two parts of the PHARAOH algorithm. We applied the multithreading scheme of WISARD to the (1) automated estimation step of penalization parameters and (2) parameter estimation from permuted phenotypes to construct an empirical null distribution, because a series of parameter combinations or a model with permuted phenotypes can be evaluated independently. As shown in Table 1, which shows the result of PHARAOH multithreading, the multithreaded PHARAOH analysis can be boosted as the number of threads increases.
