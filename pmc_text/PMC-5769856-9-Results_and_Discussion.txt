Limit of mutation detection
To determine the limit of mutation detection with OncoChase-AS, we used the Quantitative Multiplex Reference Standard DNA (Horizon Discovery), which contains 11 mutations with a 1% to 24.5% VAF across six cancer-related genes (BRAF, KIT, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA) (Table 1). When we performed NGS analysis with Onco-Chase-AS in duplicate, all of the expected mutations were consistently identified in both NGS analyses (Table 1). To assess the limit of mutation detection, we serially diluted the DNA sample from 50% to 10% and performed NGS analysis with each diluted DNA in duplicate. As a result, mutations with a very low MAF (<1% MAF) were successfully identified in most of the mutations (19/22, 86.4%). Mutations with a low MAF (1% to 3% MAF) were also successfully identified in most of the mutations (23/26, 88.5%). All mutations with >3% MAF were detected without exception (40/40, 100%) (Table 1). These results suggest that more than 86% of the mutations with <1% VAF can be identified by NGS analysis with OncoChase-AS. These results also suggest that any mutations with >3% frequency can be detected with this platform. When we calculated the correlation between the expected and observed VAFs by linear regression analysis, the R2 value was 0.97 (Fig. 2). This result further supports the reliability of this system for variant identification.
