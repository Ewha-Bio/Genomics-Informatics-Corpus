In addition to the nc886:PKR pathway in the tumor surveillance, does nc886 silencing play an active role in tumor etiology or progression? Two recent papers have provided several pieces of evidence for nc886 being a putative tumor suppressor [89].
First, nc886 expression is suppressed in clinical tumor samples compared to normal tissues, and more importantly, the low expression of nc886 correlates with poor survival of patients. This was seen in paired normal/tumor specimens from 88 gastric cancer (GC) and 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients [89]. nc886 expression is also silenced in a number of cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origins, such as esophagus [8], stomach [9], breast (YSL, unpublished data), ovary (YSL, unpublished data), bile duct [4], head and neck, lung, cervix [5], etc. Besides our data, several other research groups have reported that the suppressed expression of nc886 in many different cancer types including lung cancer [192627], thyroid cancer [28], and breast cancer [29]. Although these papers claimed that they detected mature miRNAs, miR-886-5p and -3p, nc886 is most probably what they detected, because their detection methods could not efficiently distinguish the mature miRNAs from nc886.
Second, the silencing of nc886 RNA expression is caused by CpG hypermethylation, which is one of the most common mechanisms to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The significance of nc886 CpG methylation in the prognosis of cancer patients has been proven by our ESCC and GC data [89] as well as other groups' data in lung cancer [19] and acute myeloid leukemia [20].
Third, acute depletion of nc886 activates oncogenes. These oncogenes include renowned ones, such as FOS, MYC, MAFB, and ID2, all of which are known to drive cells to malignancy when aberrantly overexpressed [30313233]. Also, nc886 depletion activates oncogenic NF-κB in a PKR-dependent manner [489] and in this case PKR acts as an oncogene in the few cells that have survived the nc886: PKR:eIF2α-mediated apoptotic branch. In this context, nc886 is an inhibitor of the PKR oncogene and therefore is a tumor suppressor.
Fourth, nc886 is antiproliferative. Ectopic expression of nc886 inhibits growth of several cancer cells [89]. This effect is specific, because such toxic effects are seen only in cancer cells that do not express endogenous nc886 but not in non-malignant cells that express endogenous nc886. nc886's antiproliferative role is thought to be, at least partially, through suppressing NF-κB, as supported by our experimental data from cholangiocarcinoma [4].
