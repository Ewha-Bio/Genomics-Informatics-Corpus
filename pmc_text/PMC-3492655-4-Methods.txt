CNV calling
For this study, Affymetrix 5.0 SNP array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) data of 10 subjects were randomly selected from the KARE dataset for CNV calling. Affymetrix 5.0 data of NA10851 was used as a control. For defining CNVs, we choose 3 different segmentation algorithms, PennCNV [25], QuantiSNP [26] and BirdSuite [27]. PennCNV implements a hidden Markov model (HMM) and considers SNP allelic ratio distribution in addition to signal intensity. We only used CNVs from PennCNV with samples that had a standard deviation of log R ratio (LRR) smaller than 0.2, drift values of b-allele frequency (BAF_drift) smaller than 0.01, and waviness factor between -0.05 and 0.05. For QuantiSNP, we did not apply any criteria for sample filtering, since QuantiSNP uses an Objective Bayes Hidden-Markov Model (OB-HMM) for calibrating the model for fixing the false positive error rate and maximum marginal likelihood to set other hyperparameters. It was originally developed for detecting CNVs from BeadArray SNP genotyping data of Illumina, but Affymetrix data also could be processed as long as they have probe signal intensities and B-allele frequencies. Birdsuite uses exclusive copy number analysis routine (Canary) for CNP locus and HMM for finding rare CNVs. It generates a logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD) value for each CNV that describes the likelihood of a CNV relative to no CNV over a given interval, including flanking sequences. Of the BirdSuite calls, only the CNVs that have an LOD value smaller than 2 were used for further analysis. All 3 methods were used with default values, and no other option was added or changed.
