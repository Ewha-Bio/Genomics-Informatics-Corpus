Step 1. Extracting SNP and HLA allele data
Given two reference panels to be merged, we extract SNP data from them using PLINK [12]. Then, we extract HLA genotype information from the reference panel. Because each allele in an HLA gene is coded as a binary marker in SNP2HLA format, extracting HLA allele information requires the examination of the entire set of binary markers for an HLA gene. We use our Python script to perform this extraction.
