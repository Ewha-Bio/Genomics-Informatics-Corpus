Effects of si-syntrophin beta 2 (SNTB2) on ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis in H2199 cells. (A) Expression level of SNTB2 in non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines (upper) and colony formation assay after IR in H460 and H1299 cells (lower). CTL, control. Effect of SNTB2 knockdown on IR-induced cell viability (B) and IR-induced apoptosis (C) in H1299 cells. After transfection with si-mock or si-SNTB2 into H1299 cells, cells were irradiated, and cell viability was measured by a Trypan Blue exclusion assay; lysates were analyzed by Western blot using cleaved caspase-9/-3, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bcl-2, and survivin antibodies.
