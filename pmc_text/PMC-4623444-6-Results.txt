Insulin-targeted gene set
The expression data of 20 insulin sensitive individuals downloaded from GEO (GSE22309) were analyzed to find genes controlled by insulin. In addition, the data contain expression values of transcripts before and after insulin treatment for each sample. Among the total of 12,626 probes, we selected about 9,000 genes which are protein-coding gene. With expression of each gene, we carried out paired t test between before and after insulin treatment and calculated fold change. A total of 560 genes were identified by cutoff using t test p-value (padj < 0.05) and fold change (FC > 1.2) in insulin sensitive group (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we looked for enriched GO terms using DAVID functional annotation tool, and several biological process terms of the GO database were searched (padj < 0.05). As the resulting list of terms is redundant, the lists were prunedmanually (Table 1). Most of the terms were compatible with insulin response and overlapped to GO terms which have been known from previous studies [5].
