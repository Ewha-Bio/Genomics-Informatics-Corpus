Thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer worldwide [1]. Especially, in Korea, the average annual incidence rates of thyroid cancer in 2010 was 17.8% recording the highest increasing rate among all cancers (National Cancer Information Center; http://www.cancer.go.kr/). Thyroid carcinomas can be sub-classified according to their histological and clinical features such as cellular origins or prognosis [2]. The most common subtype of thyroid cancers are papillary thyroid cancer (PTC; 80% to 85%) and follicular thyroid cancer (FTC; 10% to 25%), which are differentiated tumors derived from follicular epithelial cells. Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC; 5% to 10%) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC; 2% to 3%) are also derived from follicular cells. Parafollicular C cell-derived medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) comprises 2-3% of all thyroid cancers [2, 3]. The overall survival rates for PTC (98%), FTC (92%), and MTC (80%) are high [4], and these types have a more favorable prognosis by multimodality treatment. However, ATC has an almost typically rapid and lethal progression, and the survival rate for ATC is only 13% [4] or 1-17% [2] with a mean survival of 6 months after diagnosis [5]. Although ATC supposed to be a follicular-cell-derived cancer, and represents a terminal stage in the dedifferentiation of PTC or FTC [6], the molecular mechanisms underlying ATC are not clear. Because ATC is rare disease, it has been difficult to obtain sufficient samples to study the mechanism of the tumorigenesis associated with ATC which should have great impact to survival and treatment of patients [7]. Here, we reviewed the recent progress of the identification of genetic and epigenetic changes in ATC, focusing especially on genomic study. By this effort, we may clarify the further substances of genomic research to conquer the most aggressive type of thyroid carcinomas.
