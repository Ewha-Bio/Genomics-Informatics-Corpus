DNA genotyping has been used in forensic science for over 30 years for human identification by using short tandem repeat (STR) markers, which are highly polymorphic variants [1]. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have also been used for forensic marker, because they may provide better profiling from degraded DNA samples than STRs and do not involve repetitive sequences that may make stutter artifacts, which complicates STR profiling interpretation [2, 3]. SNPs for forensic analyses can be used for human identification, kinship analysis, inferring biogeographic ancestry, and estimating appearance traits [4].
In general, forensic DNA profiling is used for identifying persons compared with profiles of known suspects or missing persons included in a DNA database. However, in the case of absent information on felons or missing persons in the DNA profile database, it is helpful to predict unknown persons with DNA markers [5]. The prediction of externally visible characteristics (EVCs) from DNA has been studied for forensic genetics over the last few years [5-7]. The EVCs include hair, skin and eye color, height, and facial morphology, which have high heritability [8-10].
The genome-wide association study (GWAS), a linkage analysis and candidate gene study, has been used to identify genetic variants influencing such EVCs. Variations in the MC1R gene have been associated with red hair [11]. The red hair prediction method, based on a combination of non-synonymous SNPs in MC1R, was already developed for forensic science more than 10 years ago [12], and its accuracy was 84% in the prediction of red-haired individuals. The SNPs in the OCA2 locus and the adjacent HERC2 gene in Europeans showed a strong correlation with blue and brown eye color [13, 14]. Other genes were also identified as contributing to hair, eye, and skin color variations, such as IRF4, KITLG, SLC24A4, SLC45A2, TYRP1, TYP, and ASIP [15].
Recent studies using genome-wide association analysis have identified genes and variations correlating with human visible phenotypes and developed a phenotype prediction program [16-19]. HIrisPlex is capable of predicting hair and eye color from DNA with 24 SNP variations [19]. Six of the 24 SNPs used for eye color prediction in the HIrisPlex program are rs12913832 (HERC2), rs1800407 (OCA2), rs12896399 (SLC24A4), rs16891982 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs1393350 (TYR), and rs12203592 (IRF4), and 4 of these SNPs within HERC2, OCA2, SLC45A2, and IRF4 are also used for hair color prediction. To predict hair color and hair color shade, HIrisPlex uses 22 SNPs as follows: N29insA, rs11547464, rs885479, rs1805008, rs1805005, rs1805006, rs1805007, rs1805009, Y152OCH, rs2228479, and rs1110400 from the MC1R gene, rs28777 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs16891982 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), rs12821256 (KITLG), rs4959270 (EXOC2), rs12203592 (IRF4), rs1042602 (TYR), rs1800407 (OCA2), rs2402130 (SLC24A4), rs12913832 (HERC2), rs2378249 (PIGU/ASIP), and rs683 (TYRP1). The results of these 24 SNPs when their minor alleles are input into HIrisPlex are used to predict the color of an individual with the highest probability of the 3 eye color categories (brown, blue, or intermediate) and 4 hair color categories (blond, brown, red, and black). On average, their prediction accuracy was 69.5% for blonde hair, 78.5% for brown, 80% for red, 87.5% for black hair, and over 90% for blue and brown eyes.
Few GWASs on color-related phenotype have been carried out in Asian populations [20, 21]. Therefore, most prediction models for EVCs have been constructed and validated based on genotype and phenotype information on Europeans; these prediction models must be validated in diverse ethnic populations [16-19]. In this study, we selected potentially useful variations for forensic science that are associated with hair and eye color, iris pattern, and facial morphology, based on previous studies, and analyzed their frequencies in the Korean population.
