Tertiary structure modeling and validation
E6 protein of HPV type 16 has 158 amino acids in its protein sequence. Since the three-dimensional structure of E6 was not available, its structure model was predicted using the Phyre 2 server by taking chain C of the crystal structure of full-length HPV oncoprotein e62 in complex with the lxxll peptide of ubiquitin ligase e6ap (PDB ID: 4GIZ) as a structural template. The query coverage of the target-template alignment was 90% with 96% identity. The predicted structure was then subjected to the Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application (YASARA) Energy Minimization Server for structural refinement. The total energy for the refined structure obtained from the YASARA Energy Minimization Server was -48,054.9 kcal/mol (score, -2.55), whereas prior to energy minimization, it was 81,463,636,897 kcal/mol (score, -4.21).
The stereochemistry of the refined model (Procheck analysis) (Fig. 2A) revealed that 99.2% of residues were situated in the most favorable region and additional allowed regions, and 0.8% (Gln106) of residues were in the generously allowed region, whereas none of the residues fell in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2B). ProSA-web evaluation revealed a compatible Z score (Fig. 2C) value of -4.34, which is well within the range of native conformations of crystal structures [23]. The overall residue energies of the E6 3D model were largely negative except for one peak (Fig. 2D). The 3D model of HPV-16 E6 protein showed an LG score of 2.531 by Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool, implying a high accuracy level of the predicted structure. A ProQ LG score >2.5 is necessary for suggesting that a model is of very good quality [24].
Similar assumptions were achieved using the ERRAT plot (Fig. 2E), where the overall quality factor was 91%. All of these outcomes recommended the reliability of the proposed model.
