IVAG is mostly written in the R programming language [6] and dockerized [7] with all required dependencies to avoid compatibility issues. It uses the Shiny package [8] to build a user-friendly web interface and several other packages to analyze and visualize RNA-seq and GWAS data (Supplementary Table 1). VCFtools [9] and PLINK (v1.90b4.6) [10] were used for the LD analysis. The JBrowse platform [11] was integrated into IVAG, and all intermediate steps required for custom track construction were automated using a custom BASH script. Three publicly available plugins (Supplementary Table 2), with slight modification, were incorporated into the genome browser to build GWAS, GC content, and browser extensible data (BED) tracks. Gene transfer format (GTF)-to-general feature format 3 (GFF3) format conversion was carried out with Cufflinks (2.2.1) [12]. Binary sequence alignment map (BAM) and variant call format (VCF) files were sorted with SAMtools [13]. Example data were prepared using publicly available RNA-seq and GWAS data (Supplementary Table 3).
