DNA extraction and sample preparation
DNA was extracted from 350 ÂµL of whole blood using the MagAttract DNA Blood Midi M48 Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) using a Qiagen BioRobot M48 workstation, according to the manufacturer's protocols automatically. The purity and concentration of isolated DNA were determined by a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). We needed more detailed quantity of each sample for genotyping reaction; so, we measured the quantity of DNA using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) and made a dry plate for genotyping reactions with 10 ng per well of 384 plates.
