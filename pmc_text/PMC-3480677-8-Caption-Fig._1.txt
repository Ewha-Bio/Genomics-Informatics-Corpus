Genomic location and exon image of SCN5A gene and voltage-gated Na+ channel α subunit. (A) The SCN5A gene is located on human chromosome 3p21. (B) Structure of SCN5A gene: the SCN5A gene consists of 28 exons; among these, exon 1 is an untranslated region. (C) The voltage-gated Na+ channel α subunit consists of 4 homologous domains (DI-DIV), each containing 6 transmembrane-spanning segments (S1-S6).
