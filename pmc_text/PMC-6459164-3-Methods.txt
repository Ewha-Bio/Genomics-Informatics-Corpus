Measurement of VJ recombination events
Unmapped reads were collapsed, such that repeatedly appearing reads were regarded as a single read. The read count of each sequence was sorted in descending order, and the top 10,000 reads were selected from individual samples. The reads corresponding to V, D, J regions of the B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) loci were selected by an immunoglobulin variable domain sequence analysis tool, called IgBlast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/) [14]. Then, VJ recombination events were considered, using only in-frame sequence reads of 6 V, D, J regions. Alpha and beta diversity levels were calculated by vegan and the betapart library in R, respectively. A dot plot and a violin plot were visualized using R. p-values were calculated by permutation test with 1,000 permutations.
