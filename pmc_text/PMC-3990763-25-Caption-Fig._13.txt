Genetic variation in patients despite the similarity in biomedical data. Details of several genes of interest for the four patients: ALL92, ALL129, ALL321, and ALL323. The patients' clinical properties are similar, including medium risk, male, deceased, and Study 8 protocol. However, the Affymetrix expression microarrays and Illumina SNP values are quite varied among these patients.
