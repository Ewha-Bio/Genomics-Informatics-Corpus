Examples of RNA processing steps to produce two RNA isoforms. Two different mRNAs are produced from alternative splicing (A) and RNA editing (B). The top panel shows precursor mRNAs and the bottom shows mature RNAs after posttranscriptional processing. Exons are illustrated as boxes, while lines represent introns. For alternative splicing (A), exon skipping is shown as one example of the numerous modes. In this case, an exon is selectively included from the primary transcript. Constitutively expressed exons are depicted in green, and alternatively spliced exons are depicted in light blue. For RNA editing (B), the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) is shown in the double-stranded RNA structure. The editing is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme. Most events occur in the noncoding region of the transcript, but the minor case showing editing in a coding sequence is shown in this figure.
