HLA-B27 is the strongest and most well-known genetic factor of AS. However, AS develops in less than 5% of HLA-B27–positive individuals, suggesting the existence of additional genetic factors. Indeed, a number of genetic markers in non-MHC genes have been identified by SNP GWASs and CNV GWASs [34567]. In this study, we performed an SNP genotyping assay to evaluate three AS-associated SNP candidates (rs11249215 in RUNX3, rs6556416 in IL12B, and rs8070463 in TBKBP1) that were discovered in Caucasians but have not been studied in Koreans. To generate more reliable data, we used a large sample set in this study (572 AS patients and 566 healthy controls). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the association of these three SNPs in Koreans. As a result, rs11249215 in RUNX3 was found to be significantly associated with the risk of AS in Koreans. However, rs6556416 in IL12B and rs4389526 in ANTXR2 were not replicated in Koreans.
RUNX3 (Runt-related transcription factor 3) is a member of a family of transcription factors that are important regulators of lineage-specific gene expression. Woolf et al. [16] demonstrated that Runx3 is highly expressed in thymic medulla and that it promotes the differentiation of T cell to CD8+ T cells during thymopoiesis. More recently, RUNX3 was found to be linked to human autoimmune disease and inflammation. For example, Fainaru et al. [17] reported that Runx3 knockout mice develop spontaneous eosinophilic lung inflammation, which is attributed to dendritic cells becoming insensitive to transforming growth factor β–induced inhibition of maturation. RUNX3 polymorphisms are associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriatic arthritis [1819]. Apel et al. [18] identified that RUNX3 is involved in CD8+ T lymphocyte differentiation and is related to psoriatic arthritis through a T cell–mediated mechanism. The association between the RUNX3 polymorphism rs11249215 and AS has also been reported in Caucasian [4] and Han Chinese populations [12]. Furthermore, Vecellio et al. [20] demonstrated that rs4648889 in RUNX3 is associated with AS and that its risk allele reduces RUNX3 expression. Consistent with previous studies, in this study, we confirmed that rs11249215 in RUNX3 is significantly associated with the risk of AS in Koreans in the recessive model. Because the homozygous risk allele frequency is important when an SNP is a recessive marker, we examined the homozygous risk allele frequency for rs11249215 and found that it was significantly higher in AS patients (homozygous risk allele frequencies [HoF] = 0.36) than in controls (HoF = 0.33) (Table 2). Of note, the MAF of rs11249215 in controls was largely similar to that in East Asians from the 1000 Genomes Project, suggesting that our study group was not biased and that the genotyping was appropriate. Because rs11249215 is located in the promoter of RUNX3, further studies on its molecular effects will help elucidate the pathogenesis of AS. In addition, considering that new SNPs are being reported to be associated with AS, other replication studies of newly identified SNPs are also needed.
In conclusion, we performed a replication study of three SNPs with a relatively large cohort of samples and found that rs11249215 in RUNX3 is significantly associated with the risk of AS in Koreans. These results will be helpful in elucidating the pathogenesis of AS and may be useful for developing risk prediction models for AS in Koreans.
