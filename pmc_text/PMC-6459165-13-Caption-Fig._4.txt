Immune response of the representative recombinant proteins derived from the 120 and 150 kDa subunits and chimera against sera from active-stage NC patients. Each protein was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transblotted to a PVDF membrane. The blots were incubated with 1:200 diluted individual NC sera overnight. The blots were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-human IgG and developed with 4-chloro-1- naphthol as a chromogen. NC, neurocysticercosis; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride.
