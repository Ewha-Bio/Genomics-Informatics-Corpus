Mechanisms of Alu amplification. This figure depicts four different mechanisms for Alu amplification. (A) Master gene model is a typical mechanism. All members of the same Alu subfamily are derived from one or a few transpositionally active Alu elements. When the active Alu element mutates but remains the transposition activity, it will produce a new Alu subfamily. (B) Intermediate model is literally an intermediate form of master gene and transposon models. More than a few active Alu elements exist in host genome and each of them actively produces its progenies. (C) Transposon model suggests that all Alu elements including mutated elements have transposition activities. (D) Stealth driver model suggests that old Alu element which stayed transcriptionally dormant for the extended period can produce a new Alu subfamily by retrieving a high transposition activity. Green and blue boxes indicate active and inactive Alu elements, respectively. X indicates a mutation and the mutated Alu elements represent different subfamilies.
