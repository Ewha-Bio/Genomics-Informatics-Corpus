Dual luciferase assay
The pGL3 basic vector containing WT MRP2 promoter variants was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells to measure the activity of the MRP2 promoter with and without VPA (P4543; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The day before transfection, 0.2 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells were seeded in a 12-well plate in order to reach 90-95% confluence at the time of transfection; 1.6 µg of pGL3-MRP2, including the variants and mock, was added to wells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Vector-containing Renilla luciferase was cotransfected in order to confirm the transfection efficiency of the pGL3-MRP2 vector. After a 3- to 5-h incubation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitrogen) and incubated at 37℃ with 5% humidified CO2 for 24 h. Reporter activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). After removing the growth medium, cells were washed with PBS, and the plates were placed on a rocking platform shaker with 250 µL of 1 × passive lysis buffer per well for 15 min. Lysates were transferred to an e-tube, and luciferase binding was performed with 50 µL LARII and 10-50 µL cell lysate in a 96-well assay plate (Costar; Corning Incorp., Corning, NY, USA). After 10 s, light emission was measured using a luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Wildbad, Germany), and Stop & Glo was added to each well to stop firefly luciferase activity and evoke Renilla luciferase activity.
