Identification of non-human homologous essential proteins in F. nucleatum
Then the Set2 proteome was subjected to BLASTP analysis with Database of Essential Genes (DEG; http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/), which contains all the essential genes currently available. An E-value of 10–100 was set as the cutoff value [22]. Thus, a Set3 proteome of F. nucleatum was obtained by grouping the proteins that showed an E-value 10–100. Set3 proteome contains the proteins of F. nucleatum that could be considered as novel drug targets because they are not present in the host and are involved in essential metabolic functions in the bacterium.
