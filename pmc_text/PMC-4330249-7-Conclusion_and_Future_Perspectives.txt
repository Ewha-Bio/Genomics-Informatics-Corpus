Cancer has continually been the leading cause of death worldwide for decades. Thus, researchers have actively devoted themselves to studying cancer therapeutics. The present mode of treatment based on chemotherapy and radiotherapy is very expensive and also exhibits serious side effects in human beings. Keeping in view the significance of herbs, this review is written to show the role of nimbolide in the prevention of various types of cancer through the activation or inactivation of various signaling pathways. These reported features, combined with the absence of side effects and being inexpensive and easy to access, neem and its constituent nimbolide may be proved very effective therapeutics in the management of cancers. Nimbolide is a potential chemopreventive agent that is able to suppress multiple signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis and hence is an attractive candidate for further research. Currently, nimbolide is undergoing extensive research to determine the dose efficacy and administration form that could enhance its bioavailability and chemopreventive properties. How nimbolide mediates all of these effects is not completely understood. However, most of the anticancer activities assigned to nimbolide have been based on in vitro studies. While in vitro studies predominantly established the anti-cancer effects of nimbolide on cancer cells, its efficiency in vivo has still to be proven.
