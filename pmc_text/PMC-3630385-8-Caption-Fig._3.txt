Receiver operating characteristic analysis to measure the discriminatory power of each genetic risk score model in predicting normal-karyotype acute myeloid leukemia. (A) Model 1 (rs75156964), model 3 (rs75156964, rs56213454, and rs6604516), and model 5 (rs75156964, rs56213454, rs6604516, rs10888338, and rs2443878). (B) A model comprising five candidate single nucleotide variations (rs75459784, rs55824312, rs200239604, rs56213454, and rs56371919) in MUC4, CNTNAP2, and GNAS, reported in previous studies (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.00). GRS, genetic risk score.
