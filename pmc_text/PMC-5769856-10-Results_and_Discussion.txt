Performance in detecting mutations
To determine how completely OncoChase-AS NGS detected the expected mutations, we used Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which is a mixture of 55 tumors that contain more than 500 COSMIC mutations across 53 genes. Among the mutations in the Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA, OncoChase-AS targeted 358 mutations. Therefore, in principle, 358 mutations are expected to detected, if OncoChase-AS NGS works perfectly. In the first analysis, 353 out of the 358 expected mutations were detected (98.6% concordance). In the second analysis, all 358 mutations were detected (100% concordance). In the third analysis, the concordance rate was 98.6% (353/358) (Table 2). These results indicate that OncoChase-AS is fairly sensitive and reliable in identifying mutations.
