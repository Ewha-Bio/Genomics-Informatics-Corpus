Schematic representation of the artificial neural networks for a single token in NeuroNER: Snippet of the architecture used in NeuroNER. The type of recurrent neural network (RNN) is long short term memory (LSTM). n is the number of tokens Xi is the ith token. Vr is the mapping from tokens to token embeddings. l(i) is the number of characters, and Xi,j is the jth character of the ith token. Vc is the mapping from characters to character embeddings. ei is the character-enhanced token embeddings of the ith token. di is the output of the LSTM of label prediction layer, ai is the probability vector over labels, and yi is the predicted label of the ith token.
