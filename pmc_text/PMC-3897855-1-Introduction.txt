Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc-finger transcription factors considered to be crucial regulators of cell differentiation, development, and cell cycle progression [1]. Each KLF has its own function and acts as a transcriptional activator or repressor, depending on the promoters [2]. Several features distinguish KLFs from the highly conserved classical zinc-finger transcription factors [2, 3]. Zinc-fingers are located at the carboxyl terminus of the protein and permit KLFs to bind to related GC- and CACCC-boxes of DNA [4]. In contrast to the zinc-finger regions, the non-DNA-binding regions are highly controversial, regulate activation and repression, and often mediate interaction of protein-protein [3].
Recently, a potential role for KLFs in adipogenesis has been suggested [5]. For example, KLF5 and KLF2 are expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and bind directly to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ2 (PPARγ2) promoter or inhibit its activity [6]. KLF5 (also known as BTEB2 or IKLF) was first identified as a transcription factor for SMemb/non-muscle myosin heavy chain-B (NMHC-B), a marker of smooth muscle cells in vascular disease [7]. KLF5 upregulates in activated smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts of vascular lesions and downregulates in adult vessels [7, 8] KLF5 binds directly to the PPARγ promoter, and PPARγ activity can be enhanced by either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ [4]. Therefore, several studies suggested KLF5 is downstream of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ and upstream of PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation [4, 5]. Just like KLF2, KLF5 might contribute to adipogenesis transcriptional regulation via PPARγ. KLF15 induces differentiation of 3T3-L1 in the late stage and expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 [9]. KLF7 is expressed in adipocytes, as well as several human tissues, such as pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver [10]. However, the functions of these KLFs in adipocyte differentiation in vivo remain unclear.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide. The imbalance between energy expenditures and energy intakes causes excessive fat accumulation, leading to an increase of the number and/or size of fat cells [4]. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum energy required to retain the physiological functions of the body while awake. BMR accounts for approximately 45% to 70% of total energy expenditure in most healthy adults and is affected by age, gender, body surface area, body composition, genetic composition, pregnancy, and hormonal status directly [11, 12]. Thus, estimating BMR is important for establishing strategies of obesity prevention programs [11]. For several years, numerous predictive equations for BMR have been developed in different populations. Although many studies have shown the influence of ethnicity on BMR, their results have been inconsistent [11, 12].
On the other hand, resting metabolic rate (RMR) is also the energy requirement to support vital functions while resting in the supine position. Just like the BMR, RMR is quantitatively the largest component of daily energy expenditure (60-75%). In order to evaluate RMR, direct and indirect calorimeters, such as whole-room calorimeters, open-circuit Douglas bag method, metabolic carts, and ventilated hood systems, are required, and these methods are not helpful nor cost-effective for large-scale epidemiological studies. Therefore, regression equations have been used to estimate resting energy requirements in large populations [13].
So far, several studies have suggested that uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is involved in the regulation of energy expenditure metabolism, body weight, and obesity [14]. In other studies, the polymorphism of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene did not have an independent effect on BMR; however, its synergistic effect with the beta3-AR gene polymorphism induced a lower BMR than the polymorphism of beta3-AR gene alone [15]. Recently, to investigate the clinical relevance of KLF5 in complex diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within KLF5 have been analyzed; however, an association of KLF5 SNPs with BMR of children has not been identified yet. The purpose of this study is 1) to identify the contribution of novel genetic variations of KLF5 to increased BMR and the suppression of obesity in Korean children and 2) to make better use of the alterations of KLF5 in future clinical intervention studies.
