Korean Holstein data
This study used 462 Holsteins from Korea, and they had information on three phenotypes related to milk production for parity 1 (Fig. 1). Three traits used in this study were milk yield, milk fat, and milk protein; 339 of 462 Holsteins in records of parity 1 had records of parity 2. The individuals produced milk in 63 farms and were born in 2005 to 2012. All candidates were measured for a range of quantitative traits through public surveys for livestock improvement.
