Construction of the fosmid library
The amplified high-molecular-weight DNA from the Prebiocide or Tank A water samples was cloned with fosmid vectors. In order to select DNA fragments longer than 20 kb, the amplified DNA was visualized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in 1% low-melting-point agarose at 4.5 V/cm in 1 × TBE buffer for 13 h. DNA fragments larger than 20 kb were cut out, extracted from the gel, and re-run for 5 h under the same conditions. These resolved DNA fragments were used to construct a fosmid library by following the procedure detailed by the manufacturer. Using the CopyControl Fosmid Library Construction Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), the sheared DNA was end-repaired to generate blunt 5'-phosphorylated ends and then ligated directly into the cloning-ready CopyControl pCC1FOS vector (Fig. 1) at a 10:1 vector:insert ratio. The ligated DNA was then packaged using ultrahigh-efficiency MaxPlax Lambda Packaging Extract (Epicentre) and was plated on phage T1-resistant Escherichia coli cells to produce the library. Packaging a single 10-µL ligation reaction generated more than 100,000 fosmid clones from the DNA isolated from the Prebiocide and Tank A water samples. DNA from several randomly chosen clones was purified using the Direct Lysis Fosmid96 Kit (Epicentre) for high-throughput fosmid sequencing.
