Identification and classification of DNAJ/K family from 339 eukaryotic genomes
An automated pipeline was programmed to identify and classify the DNAJ/K families (Fig. 1). All protein sequences of the 339 genomes deposited in the Comparative Fungal Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr) [16] were filtered according to the following description. Six InterPro terms (release 12.0) for DNAJ (IPR012724, IPR008971, IPR003095, IPR001305, IPR002939, and IPR001623) and three for DNAK (IPR013126, IPR001023, and IPR012725) were used to retrieve corresponding sequences. When the J domain or any of the DNAK domains was at least 50 amino acids (aa), it was defined as 'putative', and the others were tagged as 'candidate DNAJ/Ks'. The HPD tripeptide motif and glycine-rich region were identified from the 'putative DNAJ' sequences. The DNAK family was clustered by sequence similarity (BLAST E-value cutoff e-5) using the Tribe Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm [17], because no class has been made in this family. Finally, 12,908 DNAJs and 4,886 DNAKs were identified and deposited into EDD. In the DNAJ family, 895, 3,172, and 8,700 proteins were classified as type I, II, and III, respectively. Twenty-one clusters were determined in DNAK, and 4,853 proteins (99.1%) belonged to the first four clusters.
