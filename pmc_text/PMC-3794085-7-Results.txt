Genome-wide association studies
GWAS were conducted for each cohort, and the target phenotypes were dtSBP, dtDBP, and OH. The GWAS results of each cohort were combined by meta-analyses, and quantile-quantile plots and Manhattan plots are depicted in Fig. 1.
All detected SNPs are described in Table 2. Five SNPs for dtSBP trait and three SNPs for dtDBP trait passed our criteria (replicated in both cohorts [Ansung and Ansan] and p < 1 × 10-5), but unfortunately, the SNPs of the OH case control GWAS did not pass our p-value criteria. Among the significant SNPs, four SNPs (rs6736587, rs6756959, rs6715049, and rs17020502) were in the high linkage disequilibrium status (r2 > 0.9) and were including the most significant SNP, rs6736587 (meta-analysis p-value, 5.3 × 10-8). The region of four SNPs was located in the intergenic region of chromosome 2, and the nearest gene (CTNNA2) was located at 1 Mb of distance. The remaining SNPs revealed a suggestive association (p < 1 × 10-5) with dtSBP at rs7098785 (PIK3AP1 intron) and with dtDBP at rs6892553, rs16887217, and rs4959677, which were located in the ACTBL2 3' flanking, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR) intron, and intergenic regions (chromosome 6p 25.2), respectively.
