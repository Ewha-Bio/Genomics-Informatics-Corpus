Enhancer RNAs
RNAs at enhancers (eRNAs) were first characterized by observing transcription activities at the promoter-distal CREB binding protein-binding sites in mouse cortical neurons [51]. The bidirectional property of eRNAs and their association with gene expression were further studied using nascent RNAs from global run-on sequencing (GROseq) data [52, 53]. ENCODE used RNA assays to detect transcription activity. Besides the bidirectional property, ENCODE identified transcriptional initiation using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) [54] signals. Interestingly, they found polyadenylated eRNAs, although most eRNAs were prevalent in the nonpolyadenylated form. They also observed that histone marks associated with eRNAs were the factors for transcriptional initiation and elongation: H3K27ac, H3K79me2, and RNA polymerase. These lines of evidence suggest regulatory functions of eRNAs.
