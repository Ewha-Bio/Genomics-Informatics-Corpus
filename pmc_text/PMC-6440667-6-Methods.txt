SNP selection for analysis
To design a model for predicting metabolic syndrome in the nonobese population, we selected the SNPs in two ways. In the first way, we used the genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog database. We extracted the SNP list from the GWAS Catalog with keywords such as “metabolic syndrome,” “obesity,” and “adipose tissue.” For the extracted SNPs, we used SNPs that were included among the SNPs of the Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.0-96 Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and had a p-value of less than 0.01 in the case control study for metabolic syndrome in our nonobese population. In the second way, we performed a GWAS study for metabolic syndrome in our nonobese population and selected the SNPs with p-values that passed the Bonferroni-corrected threshold (p < 8.52 × 10−8). We included all the SNPs selected using both ways to design the algorithm.
