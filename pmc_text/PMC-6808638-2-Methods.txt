Dataset and data handling
As a public neuroblastoma dataset, we downloaded accession GSE85047 [15] from the GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). GSE85047 contains 280 samples of neuroblastoma clinical data and the data matrix includes INSS stage and expression array data. An expression array was performed using an Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) (Fig. 1). The INSS stages (1, 2, 3, 4, and 4S) were considered as classes.
In order to convert the array ID into the HUGO gene symbol, we used the GPL5175 probe-gene symbol mapping annotation file. Next, we edited the matrix containing only INSS stage and gene expression array data for data feeding into the DNN architecture. The data matrix was 280 patients by 13,091 gene symbols. We split this data matrix into a training set and test set at a ratio of 8:2, using scikit-learn train_test_split (Fig. 1).
