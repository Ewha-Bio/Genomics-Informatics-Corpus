Integrative analysis of proteomic data with other types of global data. The concepts for molecular level (A) and network based integration (B) are shown. In the top panel, two example cases (one for tissue data and the other for serum data) are illustrated, and also one example case for integrative analysis of three types of global datasets (proteomic, mRNA expression, and DNA/histone methylation data) is shown. In the bottom panel, network based integration of four types of global data using differentially expressed molecules from them are schematically displayed. DEPs, differentially expressed proteins; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry.
