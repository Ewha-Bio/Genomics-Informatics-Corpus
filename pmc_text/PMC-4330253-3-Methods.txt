Study phenotypes and covariates
We used the general information on resident areas (Anseong or Ansan), sex, and age as the covariates and past disease history of diabetes, hypertension, and lipidemia as exclusion criteria for non-METS healthy controls. The height and body weight were used to calculate the body mass index (BMI) as another covariate, and waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP), fasting plasma glucose levels (GLU0), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) were used to diagnose METS. METS was defined by the presence of three or more of the following five components according to the NCEP-ATPIII criteria using WC for Asians [14, 15]: WC (≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women), HDL (<40 mg/dL for men, <50 mg/dL for women), TG (≥150 mg/dL), SBP (≥130 mm Hg) and/or DBP (≥85 mm Hg), and GLU0 (≥100 mg/dL).
