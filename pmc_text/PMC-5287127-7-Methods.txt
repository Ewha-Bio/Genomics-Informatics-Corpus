Validation of CNVs
We carried out quantitative PCR using the TaqMan Copy Number Assay (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocols to verify estimated CNV regions. In total, seven pre-designed and one custom designed probe was used to validate the existence of the CNV. Validation samples, including cases and controls, were randomly selected from each estimated genotype cluster. All validation experiments were replicated 3 times to increase the accuracy of the validation. The copy number in each individual was calculated with Copy Caller v2.0 using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method according to the manufacturer's protocols.
