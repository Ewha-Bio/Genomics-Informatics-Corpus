Functional analysis
The DEGs were concentrated in several important biological functions
The functions that were most significantly upregulated by COX-2 overexpression in U2OS cells were skeletal system development and morphogenesis, bone development and morphogenesis, ossification, and positive regulation of cell proliferation (p < 0.05) (Table 4). The genes of COL1A1, COL5A2, FBN1, HOXD10, RUNX2, and TRAPPC2 are involved in skeletal system development and morphogenesis. The genes of COL1A1, COL5A2, and RUNX2 are involved in bone development, morphogenesis and ossification. The genes of DDR2, RAC2, RUNX2, and TSPAN31 are involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation (Table 4).
The functions that were most significantly downregulated by COX-2 overexpression in U2OS cells were nucleosome assembly, chromatin assembly, and DNA packaging (p < 0.05). The genes of HIST1H1D, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H3H, and HIST1H4C are involved in these processes (Table 5).
