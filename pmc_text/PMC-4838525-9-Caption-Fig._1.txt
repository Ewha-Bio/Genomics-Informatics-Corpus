Basic data analysis pipeline for liquid chromatographyâ€“tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data. This pipeline includes peptide/protein identification, peptide/protein quantification, and identification of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Each of bioinformatics analyses in the pipeline is schematically shown together with the concepts and the tools. PSMs, peptide-spectrum matches; FDRs, false discovery rates; iCAT, isotope-coded affinity tag; iTRAQ, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation; TMT, tandem mass tags.
