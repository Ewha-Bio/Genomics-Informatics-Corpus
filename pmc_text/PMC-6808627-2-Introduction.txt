The last few decades have witnessed a massive explosion of information in the life sciences. However, an important proportion of this information, relevant to this field, is not available from databases, but is instead present in unstructured scientific documents, such as journal articles, reviews, abstracts, and reports. Agronomy is an overarching field that is comprised of diverse domains such as genetics, plant molecular biology, ecology and soil science [1]. Despite advancements in information technology, scientific advancements in agronomy are still commonly based on text. To effectively develop applications to improve crop production through sustainable methods, however, it is important to overlap research findings from these various subdomains, as they are highly interconnected. However, the collection of content is growing continuously, and the information currently available is unstructured text. Using these resources more efficiently, and taking advantage of associated cross-disciplinary research opportunities, poses a major challenge to both biologists and information technologists. One important subtask of information extraction is to identify biological entities, and their classifications, an endeavor known as named-entity recognition (NER).
Identifying biological entities, from text, is not trivial. Despite the existence of many available approaches to handle this problem in general, and in biomedical domains in particular, few comprehensive studies have been implemented for plants, especially rice. Moreover, we found that rare benchmarks are available for many plant species, but none for rice. Thus, taken together, we faced various difficulties to exploit advanced machine learning methods, for the accurate analysis of rice.
