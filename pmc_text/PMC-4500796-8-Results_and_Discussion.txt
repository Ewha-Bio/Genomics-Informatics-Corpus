Exome sequencing depth for diagnostic genes
Next, we analyzed the genomic coverage and mean depths for 175 diagnostic genes (Supplementary Table 1) with respect to the diverse depths used. These genes have been widely used for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes at the Seoul National University Hospital in Korea. Specifically, these diagnostic genes are a subset of genes from the exome dataset. The percentage of mapped sequences in the coding regions of the 175 genes was almost constant for each depth in the individual samples, although there were slight variations across the samples (Supplementary Table 2). We further observed that the distributions of the average mapped depths between all human genes in the platform and the diagnostic genes were similar (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, with increasing depths, as expected, the median average mean depth of the ten samples increased almost constantly from a depth of 13.3× to 125.1× (on average, an increase of 12.4× per depth) (bar charts in Fig. 4). In contrast, the coverage curves for the coding regions of the diagnostic genes followed logarithmic trends, regardless of the thresholds of the minimum read depths (line charts in Fig. 4). For example, based on the regions with more than 1× mapped depth, the coverage increased from 99.3% to 99.7% (0.4% increase) at 120× depth compared to that at 20×. However, the coverage increased by only 0.1% at a depth of 80× (totally, 200×). Similarly, at 25× minimum mapped depth, over 77.9% of the genomic regions were covered when 120× was used. Moreover, a 64.6% increase in coverage was observed in the first half (from 13.3% at 20× to 77.9% at 120×), whereas a 7.6% increase was observed in the latter (from 77.9% at 120× to 85.5% to at 200×). It is known that a 25× mapping depth is the minimum for detecting heterozygous alleles [2829]. In other words, the genomic coverage of the diagnostic genes was not increased significantly after 120×.
We next checked the number and positions of SNPs that have been detected in the early onset breast cancer 2 gene (BRCA2), one of the major risk factors in the development of this cancer [3031]. The results indicate that the read depths of SNPs in BRCA2 increased with increasing sequencing depths (Fig. 5A). However, most of the SNPs had been identified by the time 120× depth was reached, and no more were identified after 140× depth was used (Fig. 5B). Only mapped read depths increased with increasing sequence depths. Similar phenomena were also observed in the early onset breast cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) (Supplementary Fig. 4), another major risk factor in this cancer type [32].
Further, we validated our depth recommendation for diagnostic variant detection using exome sequencing. To this end, we analyzed the numbers of non-synonymous (NS) SNPs, splice site acceptor or donor site (SS), and coding indel (I) variants in the diagnostic genes as a function of the diverse depths used (Fig. 6). The numbers of NS/SS/I variants of all human genes in the platform increased with increasing sequencing depths (Fig. 6A). However, the numbers of NS variants in the diagnostic genes converged sooner; there was least increase in the NS variants after 60× was used (Fig. 6B). We analyzed the numbers of NS variants using the variations in the ClinVar database [23], which is well known for clinical variants. Although there was an increase in the numbers of NS clinical variants, the rate of increase was quite low after 120× was used (Fig. 6C). We also checked the variations related to breast cancer using only the clinical variants in the ClinVar database (Fig. 6D). The results indicate that all variations associated with breast cancer were detected at 140× depth, regardless of the sample. In summary, with exome capture sequencing technique, the most significant clinical variations can be detected at an average depth of 120×.
Finally, we measured the discovery rates of variants at different sequencing depths using Sanger sequencing (Fig. 7). The results show that more than 90% variations were validated when 120×. Hence, we conclude that, using the exome capture sequencing technique, the most reliable variants are detected at an average depth of 120×.
In this study, we determined the effects of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of function-related diverse variants of human genes and diagnostic genes, especially for clinical use. For this purpose, we investigated the exome deep-sequencing data for whole blood DNA samples obtained from ten breast cancer patients using an Illumina platform GAII(x) as a function of sequencing depth.
The number of genomic variants identified using exome sequencing reached a plateau at an average sequencing depth of ~120×, and this depth allowed detection of most variations in the human genes. The results were also consistent with a diagnostic gene set and were similar across samples. Considering the diverse costs and time related to generation, processing, and maintenance of sequencing data, this suggests that a feasible depth for clinically relevant exome sequencing is about 120×. These findings can be used to address important questions on the adequate depth for exome sequencing techniques for clinical use.
