Venn diagrams summarizing the number of variables shared among 5-fold CV by variables selection methods. CV, cross-validation; ALL, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) only reported in the genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog; ASIAN, SNPs only reported in the GWAS catalog with an Asian population; KARE, Korean Association Resource; ALL + KARE, combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog and KARE cohort; ASIAN + KARE, combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog with an Asian population and the KARE cohort; SLR, stepwise logistic regression; LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; EN, Elastic-Net.
