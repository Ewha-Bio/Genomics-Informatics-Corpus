(A) Interaction stability diagram for NSC95522 showing a stable π-cation interaction with Tyr213 and H-bond interaction with Ser232. (B) NSC88253 did not form any stable interactions during the production run. (C) NSC13604 exhibited a prominent π-cation interaction with Tyr110. (D) NSC179676 displaced a stable π-cation interaction with Tyr230 and Tyr110 and water-mediated H-bond with Ser232. (E) Three-dimensional representation of ligands NSC95522 (green) and NSC179676 (magenta) interacting with the hotspot residue region (blue) of apical membrane antigen 1.
