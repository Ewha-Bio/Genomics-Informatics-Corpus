KDO and IFN-β regulate gamma activated sequence (GAS) genes together
Interestingly, two of the genes that exhibited non-additive responses are produced only by IFN-γ GAS elements: Irf8, previously known as interferon consensus sequence-binding protein 1 (ICSBP), and transporter associated with antigen processing-1 (Tap1). Upregulation of GAS-driven genes requires the Stat1 homodimer exclusively but not NF-κB; they are both produced by IFN-γ. Interestingly, in our study, we did not observe elevated expression of IFN-γ or STAT1 mRNA, but we still observed the production of GAS-driven genes.
Two phosphorylation sites, Tyr-701 and Ser-727, differentially regulate Stat1, and phosphorylation of both sites is required for maximal transcriptional activity [35, 36]. A previous study demonstrated that Stat1 is phosphorylated on both Tyr-701 and Ser-727 in LPS-treated cells after 2 h [37]. We surmise that this enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 may be mediated by KDO and IFN-β. However, when we conducted STAT1 phosphoprotein measurements with KDO and IFN-β in combination, we observed a 3-fold upregulation in phosphorylated STAT1 after 30 min (Fig. 5B). This increase in phosphorylated STAT1 during double-ligand stimulation was lower than the increase in phosphorylation of STAT1 induced by IFN-β alone (10-fold). Our previous studies with LPS- and IFN-γ-treated RAW 264.7 cells also showed non-additive increases in Irf8 and Tap1 gene expression [11]. This elevated GAS gene expression definitively indicated that KDO and IFN-β activate GAS promoters, either directly or indirectly.
