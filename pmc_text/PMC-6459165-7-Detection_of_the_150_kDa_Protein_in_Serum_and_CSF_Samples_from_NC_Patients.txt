The amount of the 150 kDa protein in CF was measured by antibody-sandwich ELISA in serum and CSF samples from NC patients. The capture antibodies were a rabbit anti-CF antibody and a monoclonal antibody against the 150 kDa protein. The detection limit of the test was 8 ng/mL of the protein. The levels of the protein in 351 sera from 255 patients (55 surgery-proven cases and 200 cases diagnosed by positive antibody reactions and pathognomonic CT/MRI findings) were below the sensitivity of the assay. Of the 276 CSF samples tested, 31 (11.2%) revealed a detectable range, which indicated that the detection of antigenemia might not be sensitive enough to diagnose NC. The 150 kDa protein appeared in the CSF in situations such as 2 days after praziquantel treatment, or a patient infected with a racemose cysticercus with a degenerated cyst wall. The appearance of free 150 kDa protein might be associated with cyst wall rupture. Either by drug treatment or by natural degeneration of old TsM, CF proteins might be released into the CSF [40].
