The newly developed web server serves information of the constructed secondary structure database from prebuilt 3D structure databases using a classification scheme, driven from backbone torsion angles. The utility of protein structure comparison, based on the backbone torsional representation, is also provided by the server. Details of the classification scheme of secondary structures, the comparison method, and the similarity measurements are as follows.
