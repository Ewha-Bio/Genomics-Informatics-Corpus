Ligand preparation
To expedite the virtual screening of ligands, the NCI ligand datasets (250,000 compounds) were screened for drug-likeness by implementing the Lipinski rule. The filtered molecules were optimized by the LigPrep module (Schr√∂dinger) by fixing the ring isomers, stereoisomers, and tautomeric forms. The reactive functional groups were also removed, and the resultants were scaled for van der Waals radii with a scaling factor of 0.80 and a partial charge cutoff of 0.15. Finally, the compounds passing all these filters were energy-minimized with OPLS_2005 as the force field.
