Phylogram overview. A phylogram was generated using SplitsTree 4 software, using the neighbor-joining method and a distance-matrix Nexus file exported from Gegenees software. The Escherichia albertii TW07627 and Escherichia fergusonii ATCC 35469 strains were set as out-groups. In addition, six unique groups (T1–T6) were analyzed. In the phylogenetic overview, a sporadic pattern of cytolethal distending toxin (CDT)–producing strains was observed, as were specific clades. These strains were related and their similarities were shown. CDT+ strains are shown in boxes. The Escherichia coli strains that were set as reference strains for biomarker-detection studies are indicated with red arrows.
