So far, most eQTL studies have examined expression-genotype relations in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Since many genes display tissue-specific expression patterns, one may argue that the expression-genotype relations observed in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines may not be preserved in other tissues or cell types. Gerrits et al. [22] observed that eQTLs were quite different, depending on the differentiation status of the cells, suggesting uncommon functional regulatory networks among different cell types. Nica et al. [23] compared cis-regulatory eQTLs from three different tissues of co-twin samples from the MuTHER project (http://www.muther.ac.uk/), observing 30% shared eQTLs, 29% exclusively tissue-specific eQTLs, and substantial differences in expression levels in different tissues. In addition to the similar proportion of exclusively tissue-specific cis-regulatory eQTLs from five different tissues, Fu et al. [24] also observed many examples of alternative regulation, where a gene is cis-associated with different SNPs, depending on the tissue. If one were to use eQTL information in predicting disease susceptibility, it is thus imperative to understand expression-genotype relations in the tissue of interest, not just in lymphoblastoid cell lines [25]. When transcript expression levels were measured in adipose tissues as well as blood in large population cohorts, unlike expression profiles in blood, a marked correlation between expression levels in adipose tissues and obesity-related traits was observed [26]. Schadt et al. [5] observed over 6,000 associations between genotypes and expression in 400 human liver samples to understand the genetic architecture of gene expression in the human liver, a metabolically important tissue involved in various common diseases, such as obesity, cancer, diabetes, and atherosclerosis.
