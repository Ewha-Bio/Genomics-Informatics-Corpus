The clinical information and expression levels of two datasets are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 1. Subgroup and sex were similarly distributed in the two datasets. The distributions of other factors were not included.The scale of expression levels in the two datasets was different; the expression values of Data 2004 ranged from 0.01 to 740, and those of Data 2005 were from 0.1 to 19,773. The expression patterns of the two datasets can be explored in Fig. 1.Lots of outliers are shown in Fig. 1A in the two datasets containing whole gene sets. However, in subsets of significant genes, the expression ranges got narrow, and the outliers were decreased (Fig. 1B). The expressions of tumor tissues in Data 2004 were upregulated and varied compared with normal tissues. If there was no outlier with a maximum value in the 14th tumor tissue in Data 2004, the expressions of the two different groups would be clearly distinguished. Any clear differences in expression were not shown between the two groups in Data 2005.
