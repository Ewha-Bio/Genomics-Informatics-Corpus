Drug treatment and cell viability assay
Bortezomib (BTZ) was purchased from Selleckchem (Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston, TX, USA), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored at ‒80°C. KMS-12-BM and KMS-12-PE were seeded into T175 flasks (SPL Life Sciences, Pochoen, Korea) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells overnight before treatment. BTZ was administered to a final concentration of 1 nM without dose escalation on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. After 48 h of drug treatment, the media was replaced.
Cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (SPL Life Sciences) and treated with BTZ for 24 h. For the cell viability assay, each well was treated with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) for 1 h, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Versa Max ELISA Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The experiments were performed in duplicate.
