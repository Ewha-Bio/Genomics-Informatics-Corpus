Detection of CNA
DNA copy number profiling of the targeted sequencing data was performed using NEXUS Copy Number, v9.0 (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA). CNA regions were defined by a rank segmentation algorithm. In the rank segmentation algorithm, we set a threshold for segmentation of p = 1.0E–6. The thresholds for copy number gain and loss were 0.3 and −0.4 on a log2 scale, respectively. The thresholds for amplification and homozygous deletion were 1.0 and −1.0 on a log2 scale, respectively.
