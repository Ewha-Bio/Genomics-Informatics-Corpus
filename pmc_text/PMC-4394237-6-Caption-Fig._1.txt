Physical map of siderophore gene clusters in Acinetobacter baumannii. Siderophore gene clusters in different A. baumannii strains. The gene clusters are based on the database of A. baumannii ATCC 19606, AB0057, ACICU, and AB307-294, which were retrieved separately from GenBank (accession Nos. ACQB00000000, CP001182-3, CP000863, and CP001172). Each color indicates the biological functions in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin. Red arrows represent the genes that were added in the acinetobactin gene cluster.
