Homology modelling ofunique essential metabolic proteins
To predict the 3D structure of unique essential metabolic proteins, homology modelling was done by the server Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine (Phyre2). The retrieved amino acid sequence in FASTA format was used as input data in Phyre2 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index). In this respect, the intensive mode of protein modeling was selected in order to get an accurate model.
