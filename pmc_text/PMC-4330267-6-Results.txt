Molecular docking analysis of kir6.2 model with phytochemicals
The results of molecular docking between the wild-type kir6.2 model and all four phytochemicals (Supplementary Fig. 1) separately for 100 runs (blind docking) and 10 runs (ATP-binding site docking) revealed that phytochemicals bind favorably in the same pocket of the wild kir6.2 model. The same observation was found in the case of the docking of the mutant kir6.2 model with the same phytochemicals (Supplementary Fig. 1), which supports the prediction of the pocket as an active binding region for phytochemicals. The best docked poses found in energetically favorable binding conditions with phytochemicals are reported (Supplementary Table 2). The comparative data of interacting residues within 4 Å in both the wild and mutant kir6.2 predicted models are reported in Table 1. The hydrophobic amino acids Ala-178, Leu-181, Phe-183, and Ala-300 are found within the pocket, providing stability towards the binding of phytochemicals with the kir6.2 models. The interacting residues of the mutant kir6.2 model are deciphered in Fig. 3, along with hydrogen bond interactions within 3.5 Å of distance (Table 2). As per the information in Table 2, the amino acids Phe-183 and Arg-301 have common involvement in hydrogen bonding in the mutant model of the kir6.2 protein with curcumin, genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene, suggesting strong binding affinity in the predicted binding pocket.
