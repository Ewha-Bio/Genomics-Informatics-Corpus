Tumor cell clustering in breast cancer
To understand subtype-specific expression patterns, hierarchical clustering method was used for 4,269 genes and 415 cells. All cells were clustered into 16 groups (Fig. 1). However, BC07 patient tumor cells were divided in two groups in the clustering result. To identify functional differences in BC07 patient tumor cells, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed, and the ERBB signaling pathway was enriched in a subpopulation of BC07 patient tumor cells. ERBB signaling was predominantly manifested by the ERBB2 gene in the HER2+ subtype, not in TNBC. The BC07 patient had a heterogeneous intratumor expression pattern regarding the HER2+ and TNBC type.
