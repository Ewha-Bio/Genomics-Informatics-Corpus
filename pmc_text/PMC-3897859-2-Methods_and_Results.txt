Data retrieval and curation
Amongst the existing 200 strains of HPV, 150 have been sequenced as of now, and their data available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Genome and proteome information of those viral strains was retrieved from NCBI. Besides PubMed, various other online resources and published literature were also explored for validating genomic, proteomic, as well as strain and disease-associated information on HPV strains. HPV strain-specific information, such as strain name, sequencing status, sequencing centre, NCBI accession ID, associated disease information with references, genome statistics (GC%, AT%, A, T, G, C count, genes, and proteins), etc., were curated from various online resources, and protein parameters (length, molecular weight, isoelectric point) were calculated using ExPASy ProtParam [4].
