Gene expression analysis
Hybridization and the resulting analyses were performed as previously described [11-13]. Cy5-labeled cRNA (from ligand-treated cells) and Cy3-labeled cRNA (from time-matched controls) were hybridized in the array. Dye-swap labeling was performed for each pair of samples. The arrays were scanned with an Agilent Scanner G2505A (Agilent Technologies), and image files were extracted with background subtraction and dye normalization using Agilent G2566AA Extraction Software version A.6.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). The microarray data used in this study were deposited into GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under the series accession number GSE11449 and platform ID GPL254.
