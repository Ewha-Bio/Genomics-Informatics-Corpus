Subjects
We conducted a GWAS using individuals sampled from a part of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES). The study subjects were recruited from population-based cohorts in the regions of Anseong and Ansan. The standardized examinations applied in this survey included 10,038 participants aged 40 to 69 years. Subjects for the replication study were recruited from the Health2 cohorts, another population-based cohort comprising the Wonju, Pyeongchang, Gangneung, Geumsan, and Naju regions in Korea. Among a total of 8,500 participants within the Health2 cohort, 7,861 subjects were selected for the replication analysis based on their age and information about concomitant disease and medication [13].
