misMM was developed to provide a streamlined and yet simple-to-use pipeline for the detection of misassembled regions, so-called MCBs, based on GBS data (Fig. 1). This pipeline was tested with the GBS data of B. rapa against the B. rapa V1.5 reference genome, which is known to have some misassembled regions compared to the recently published V2.1 genome [17]. The original linkage score heatmap that was produced by MadMapper showed many off-diagonal cells with a low score that were often clustered in stretch (Fig. 2 left panel). The off-diagonal blocks scoring less than 0.33 were defined as MCBs (Table 1, Fig. 3). For each MCB, the corresponding ADB was identified by MadMapper, based on the linkage score (Table 1). The subsequent shuffled heatmap showed clean clustering, with no low-scoring off-diagonal blocks, implying the unambiguousness of the GBS pattern in detecting misassemblies (Fig. 2 right panel). The MCBs and ADBs were distributed throughout the entire pseudomolecule. A total of 16 MCBs had an average block size of 65,477 bp, and the largest one was 410,190 bp. The average size of the ADBs was 746,707 bp, with a maximum of 4,936,893 bp. The fact that only a few small MCBs were detected and that the corresponding ADBs were large in size implies that the B. rapa V1.5 genome is well assembled overall but has a few problematic regions, as shown by the recent update of the genome [17].
We used two sets of data to validate that the ADBs were indeed in the neighboring area of the MCBs. The first one was used to find discordant BAC end pairs with one end aligned to the MCB and the other end aligned to the ADB. For example, the MCB of block number 2 in Table 1 was located in pseudomolecule A01, ranging from 11,453,104 to 11,488,588, while its corresponding ADBs were found in A04. Table 2 shows the mapping results of the six BAC end pairs of this block, the sizes of which ranged from 671 bp to 1,000 bp, with a mapping identity higher than 97.93%. While one end of the BAC pairs was mapped to the corresponding MCB in A01, all of the other ends were mapped within the ADB, ranging from 3,271,457 to 4,978,203 in A04. Likewise, 10 out of 16 blocks listed in Table 1 could be confirmed by the BAC end results. The true locations of these blocks could be estimated within the span of the corresponding BAC (average 110 kbp). The rest could not be confirmed, probably due to the distance between the MCB and ADB, making it incompatible with the BAC size.
The other validation method was the use of the gene synteny relation. Compared to the A. thaliana genome, there is evidence that the B. rapa genome has undergone triplication [32]. Accordingly, most of the A. thaliana genes are preserved in gene synteny blocks at three different places. Within block number 2 in Table 1, two B. rapa genes are annotated: Bra033489 and Bra033490 (Table 3). For all 16 genes flanking these two genes, orthologs were identified by BLASTP (Table 4). Eight A. thaliana genes in the middle—including the orthologs of two genes, AT4G14330 and AT4G14350—were out of order and broke the continuity of the synteny in the region. This is consistent with our finding that this MCB is truly misplaced in B. rapa genome V1.5. The true locations of the two B. rapa genes in this MCB can be inferred by mapping the flanking genes of AT4G14330 and AT4G14350 to the B. rapa genome (Table 5). Indeed, a total of six A. thaliana flanking genes were mapped to the B. rapa orthologs that were found in the corresponding ADBs. As expected, the gene synteny of this region is also well preserved. In this way, we can estimate the approximate relative locations of these two genes. Based on this relationship, an analysis was carried out with regard to the relationship of the protein orthologs and gene coordination between the two species. First, two genes were annotated in an example block (Table 3). When these two genes were found in a table arranged by the coordinates of the B. rapa gene, there was no continuity between the ortholog genes and the surrounding genes (Table 4). But, when we sorted this based on the coordination of A. thaliana, the ortholog genes belonging to the ADB were located consecutively around the gene belonging to the MCB (Table 5). Furthermore, the gene order that was inferred here was confirmed in the updated B. rapa V2.1 genome that was recently published [17].
In recent years, studies of expression quantitative trait loci that affect mRNA expression or protein expression using SNPs and studies to find markers that affect the environmental adaptation of plants have been becoming widely embraced [33]. For such works, accurate reference genome assembly is required. Toward that goal, our misMM pipeline is a useful tool for the identification of misassemblies in complex genomes using GBS data.
