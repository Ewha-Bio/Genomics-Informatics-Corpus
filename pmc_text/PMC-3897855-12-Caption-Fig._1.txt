Correlation of basal metabolic rate (BMR) and clinical variables according to genotype distribution of rs3782933. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) and VO2 were positively correlated with BMR in only the CC genotype in contrast to the CT or TT genotypes (A and B); meanwhile, body mass index (BMI) and muscle were related with BMR in CC, CT, and TT genotypes (C and D).
