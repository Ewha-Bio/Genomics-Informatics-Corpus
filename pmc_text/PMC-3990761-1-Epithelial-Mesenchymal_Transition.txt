Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in most cancer types. As an initial step in cancer metastasis, epithelial tumor cells in general disseminate from a primary solid tumor mass and invade into the surrounding stromal tissues. Invasion is enhanced by tumor cell activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [1, 2, 3, 4]. The EMT is characterized by the loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity and cell-cell contacts, modulation of cell-matrix adhesion, enhanced proteolytic activity, cytoskeletal remodeling, and acquisition of the ability to migrate and invade the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1, 3]. During the EMT, epithelial cells undergo molecular changes; epithelial cells gradually lose their epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, ZO-1, and cytokeratins, and concomitantly acquire mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, and alpha smooth muscle actin [1, 3]. The EMT plays a critical role in the formation of various tissues and organs, such as the mesoderm, neural crest, heart, secondary palate, and peripheral nervous systems, during embryonic development and wound healing in adult organism [2, 4]. Furthermore, the EMT is implicated in pathological processes, such as tumor cell invasion and metastasis and organ fibrosis [2].
One of the hallmarks of the EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin, which is currently thought to be a metastasis suppressor [5]. Downregulation of E-cadherin is usually mediated by E-cadherin transcriptional repressors/EMT-inducing transcription factors, including the Snail superfamily of zinc-finger factors (Snail and Slug), the ZEB family (ZEB1 and ZEB2), and basic helix-loop-helix factors (Twist1 and E47), which have been associated with tumor invasion and metastasis [4, 5]. These factors repress transcription of E-cadherin by interacting with proximal E-box elements in the E-cadherin promoter [5]. In addition, these E-cadherin repressors may be directly or indirectly involved in the upregulation of certain mesenchymal genes [5], although the precise mechanism of this regulation is largely unknown.
The EMT is triggered by soluble growth factors, such as members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and fibroblast growth factor families, epidermal growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [3, 4]. Subsequent activation of receptor-mediated signaling triggers the activation of intracellular effector molecules, such as members of the small GTPase family, leading to changes in cytoskeletal organization, and also results in the activation of EMT-inducing transcription factors [3, 4]. In addition, components of the ECM, such as collagen, and activation of integrin co-receptors are also involved in the EMT process [3]. Certain proteases are sufficient to induce the EMT [2]; for example, matrix metalloproteinase-3 triggers the EMT by increasing the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, which in turn induces Snail expression [6].
Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been identified as a novel class of EMT regulators; miRs that negatively regulate the EMT include miR-153, -155, -194, -25, -212, and -200, and miRs that positively regulate the EMT include miR-29a, -103/107, -150, and -221/22 [7]. miRs regulate invasion and metastasis by targeting the transcripts of various genes involved in the EMT event, including EMT-inducing transcription factors. For example, members of the miR-200 family are negative regulators of the EMT and are essential for maintenance of the epithelial status through the downregulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2. In turn, miR-200 members are transcriptionally repressed by ZEB1 and ZEB2, thus establishing a double-negative feedback loop [8].
The EMT was recently shown to be linked to stemness and self-renewal capacity [9, 10]. In cases of breast cancer stems, the linkage among EMT phenotype, stemness, and drug resistance has been well studied [11]. Further, epithelialmesenchymal plasticity (consisting of EMT and MET) is also described in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [12, 13, 14]. CTCs with various degrees of EMT phenotypes are found during breast cancer metastasis [15]. Therefore, CTCs may involve self-renewal capacity, which is linked to the EMT, during cancer metastasis [16].
