Different tumors or cancers in different patients have distinct genetic and cellular profiles, including kinds of genetic mutations, patterns of gene expression, and metastatic potential, which is often called cancer heterogeneity. The heterogeneity occurs both within and between tumors and leads to intra-tumor heterogeneity and inter-tumor heterogeneity, respectively [123]. Understanding cancer heterogeneity has recently been one of the important research subjects, because it is the base of difficulty in developing effective cancer treatments.
Tumor heterogeneity is basically due to the different origins of tumor cells or tissues. Various biological factors, such as smoking, gender, age, or hormonal status, can influence cancer initiation or progression, as well. Fundamentally, there are genetic variations among the hosts, even for the same cancer [456]. Astonishingly rapid development of massively parallel sequencing, alternatively called nextgeneration sequencing technologies, has recently elucidated the extent of tumor heterogeneity, and several hundred somatic mutations and structural variants that drive cancers have been identified [789].
Previously, we reported the characterization of the heterogeneity of human lung adenocarcinomas (LADCs) from patient-derived xenografts via single-cell transcriptome sequencing [10]. These cells were categorized into two separate subpopulations based on their expression of a module gene named G64. We found that G64 upregulation/ down-regulation was also present in patient tissue samples obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with G64 up-regulation corresponding to poor survival and associated with multiple clinical variables, such as smoking status (which exhibited the highest correlation) and tumor stage.
In the present study, we investigated if G64 can differentiate tumor subpopulations in other cancers, as well.
