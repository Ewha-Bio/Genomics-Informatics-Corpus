Function of nonoptimal codons
SCUB is considered to be a general phenomenon that can be observed in the genomes of almost all species [13â€“15]. However, patterns of SCUB are not equivalent to each other among different genomes in different species. Some genomes have a higher preference toward optimal codons, while other genomes do not show this preference [13]. The amounts of optimal codons vary, depending on the kinds of genes [13]. SCUB patterns in genomes are more similar in closely related species than in distantly related species [30]. Under the natural selection scenario, genes with low levels of bias in codon usage are generally thought to be the result of a lack of natural selection toward optimal codons.
However, some researchers have tried to provide an opposing explanation regarding why some genes avoid optimal codons within genes. They think that genes tend to harbor codons that are rarely used in translation, because rare codons are beneficial in checking the step right before ribosomes start translation or the protein folding step before secreting nascent protein product in the endoplasmic reticulum [31, 32]. Additionally, recently, Zhou et al. (2013) [33] provided another interesting observation in Neurospora, suggesting that the usage of non-optimal codons in the Frq gene is essential in regulating circadian rhythms.
