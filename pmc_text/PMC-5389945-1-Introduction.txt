Kidney transplantation is a necessity for patients who have non-recovery of kidney function. Transplant patients usually have a high risk of complications in the early post-operative period (3â€“6 months) [1]. Diagnoses of kidney dysfunction include acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and non-specific injury. Early diagnosis and treatment are very important for a patient's long-term health. Biopsy and measurement of creatinine levels are standard ways to monitor patients [2]. The disadvantage of using biopsies is that they cause injury to the kidney, and can cause secondary complications. The disadvantage of measuring creatinine levels is that this is a low specificity assay. For these reasons, noninvasive diagnostic tools that can outperform the current standard transplantation monitoring system are needed. It has been reported that total cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) or donor-derived cfDNA in plasma or urine can be used as a potential biomarker for the early detection of kidney dysfunction after transplantation [34567]. Several different cfDNA quantification techniques have been investigated for use in examining cfDNA as biomarker of acute rejection. These techniques include quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Y-chromosome genes [1], digital PCR (dPCR) using Y-chromosome genes [89] or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [10], and massive parallel shotgun sequencing using SNPs [811]. Several studies reported that dPCR was especially cost-effective, rapid, and sensitive for quantifying circulating donor DNA in plasma or urine samples from transplant patients [91012]. However, it is still not clear whether dPCR can be used in a clinic to accurately monitor the conditions of transplanted organs. In this study, we evaluated dPCR-based kidney transplant recipient monitoring by measuring the levels of circulating donor-derived cfDNA in patient plasma and/or urine.
