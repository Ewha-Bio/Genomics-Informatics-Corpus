Data analysis scheme. Relationships between the genetic regulatory loci and the quantitative traits (chromatin accessibility or gene expression) were explored in yeast and human. Data from different experimental settings and technical platforms were integrated into a unified analytical framework. RNA-seq, RNA-sequencing; FAIRE-seq, Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements followed by sequencing; DNase-seq, DNaseI hypersensitivity assay coupled with high-throughput sequencing; QTL, quantitative trait loci.
