Phenotype and genotype data
Details of the KARE study design have been reported [6]. Briefly, the genotype data were measured for a total of 10,038 residents in both Ansung and Ansan provinces, Korea, using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 5.0 chips (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). After quality control, 352k SNP genotypes for 8,842 samples were used in the subsequent GWA analyses. The epidemiological trait data for these individuals were also received from the KARE project. Among a total of 49 quantitative traits, we took a logarithm of 5 trait values to balance the distribution.
