The majority of individuals in this study was middle-aged (Table 1). This sample of Korean volunteers had low uric acid levels on average. Mean levels of uric acid in the dataset were higher in males (6.23 mg/dL) than in females (4.21 mg/dL). The percentage of individuals with abnormal uric acid levels (≥7.0 mg/dL) was 14.7% for the Seoul City sample. The percentage of current smokers in the Seoul City dataset was 46.4% among male subjects and 3.9% among female subjects.
Table 2 shows the p-values from a linear regression model for uric acid levels in the cohort sample, with age and sex included as covariates in the model. The rs2725220 SNP in the ABCG2 gene was found to be associated with mean uric acid levels (effect per allele 0.25 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), which was significant after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.00025). The minor allele frequency of rs2725220 was 0.222, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was satisfied (p = 0.7079).
We also analyzed the association of rs2725220 with abnormal uric acid levels (Table 3). Subjects with the GC/CC genotype had a 1.78-fold (range, 1.22- to 2.62-fold) higher risk of having abnormal uric acid levels (≥7.0 mg/dL) than subjects with the GG genotype. When analyzed by gender, the association with ABCG2 was stronger in men than in women. In Table 4, we analyzed the association of ABCG2 by body mass index (BMI) quartile levels and waist circumference quartile levels in male subjects. The association with ABCG2 was much stronger in male subjects with BMI ≥ 26.4 (OR, 5.09; 95% CI, 2.41 to 10.8) than in male subjects with BMI < 26.4. The association with ABCG2 was also a little bit stronger in male subjects with waist circumference (WC) ≥ 91 (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.10) than in male subjects with WC < 91.
