Human-specific unprocessed pseudogenes
Pseudogenization has always been an interesting topic that has not been explored much. Many pseudogenes have been identified lately that lost their functional capacity in human lineage after the divergence of humans and chimps, particularly related to immunological functions [72]. The "less is more" hypothesis states that gene loss may direct evolutionary changes, as these pseudogenized genes have impacts on adaptation of the species through evolution [73]. Even though pseudogenization does not initiate under selective pressure, the gene loss is retained and subsequently allows adaptation. Pseudogenes are found particularly important in humans, and some of them have even been identified as being responsible for certain human-specific phenotypes. For example, the sarcomeric myosin gene was lost at the time of emergence of the genus Homo and is thought to be responsible for marked reduction of hominin masticatory muscles, leading to expansion of brain size [74]. Analyzing pseudogenes in Neanderthals would be beneficial to identify genes that were lost after the divergence of Neanderthals and modern humans and determine what biological impact they may have.
