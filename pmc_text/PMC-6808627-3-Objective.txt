On the large scale, we are currently building a Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge base termed Agronomics-Linked Data (AgroLD [2], http://www.agrold.org). This knowledge base is designed to integrate data from various public, plant-centric databases such as Gramene [3], Oryzabase [4], and TAIR [5], to name a few. The aim of the AgroLD project is to provide an integrated portal for both bioinformatics and domain experts, to exploit a homogenized data model for filling knowledge gaps. Using this landscape, we aim to extract relevant information from the literature, to enrich the content of integrated datasets.
Due to the scope of the project, we exploited information from the Oryzabase database to build a dataset aimed to recognize named text entities such as rice genes and proteins. Our main purpose was to solve NER of rice biological entities, to find the best approach. By sharing this dataset on the PubAnnotation platform and be available at the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks (BioNLP-OST, https://2019.bionlp-ost.org), we invited participants to implement their own methods to solve NER tasks for this dataset. Furthermore, to evaluate the performances, we compared their approaches, implemented during the task, with our method [6], implemented before the hackathon.
