Active site prediction
Q-SiteFinder (http://www.modelling.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefinder/) was used to find out the ligand binding sites. It works by finding clusters of probes and binding hydrophobic (CH3) probes to the protein with most favorable binding energy. Q-SiteFinder requires uploading a PDB file or selecting one from the Protein Database. Proteins are primarily scanned for ligands and it uses the interaction energy between the protein and a simple van der Waals probe to locate vigorously favorable binding sites [29]. We used this tool for evaluating these features including the active site in the desired sequence.
