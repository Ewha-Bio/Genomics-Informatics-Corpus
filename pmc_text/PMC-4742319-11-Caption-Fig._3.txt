Schematic representation for the process of chromosomal rearrangements that occurred among Crocodylus siamensis chromosomes (CSI) 3, and Crocodylus niloticus chromosomes (CNI) 5 and 6. Chromosome homologies with the chicken (Gallus gallus) are obtained from the following sources: C. siamensis from Uno et al. [26] and C. niloticus from Kasai et al. [23], and are shown to the right of the chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes and/or chromosome segments are shown using the same color. Arrows indicate the directions of the chromosomal rearrangements. NF, fundamental number.
