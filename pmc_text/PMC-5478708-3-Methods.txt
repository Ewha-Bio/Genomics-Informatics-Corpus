RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted from HDFs with Trizol (Life Technologies), purified with the addition of chloroform, and precipitated with the addition of isopropanol. The RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometer and the quality of RNA was evaluated by OD 260/280 ratio and gel electrophoresis [8].
