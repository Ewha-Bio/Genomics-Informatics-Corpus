Screening of miRNAs and genes associated with solid tumor
From the literature, 23 miRNAs were found to be involved in seven solid tumors namely; lung, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, prostate, stomach, and bladder [62]. Again through exploration of online databases 64 different target genes (oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes) were observed to be regulated by these 23 miRNAs (Supplementary Table 1). Again out of these seventeen miRNAs are suspected to be effectively involved in controlling the expression pattern of 45 target genes associated in seven solid tumors (Table 1) [67891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041]. Further, binding affinity was explored using miRTarbase web server. Fifteen miRNAs and 23 target genes were selected as per the availability of MFE score (Supplementary Table 2) and subjected to further study. The involvement of these 23 genes in different biological functions are explored and inspected from UniProt web server (http://www.uniprot.org/). It was observed only PTEN, TGFBR2, and VEGFA genes mostly regulating angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and other biological functions (Table 2, Fig. 1). Further, the conservation in binding pattern among selected miRNAs and mRNAs (Table 3) were studied through sequence similarity algorithm using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) web server. The study revealed for the existence of quite less portion of conservation at sequence level among chosen 23 mRNAs and also in 15 miRNAs (Fig. 2), is not sufficient to throw light on binding patterns. Therefore, the binding affinity was evaluated between mRNA and miRNA at secondary structural level. Good MFE score suggested, the target genes PTEN, TGFBR2, and VEGFA are having a strong affinity towards miR-106a, miR-21, and miR-29b-2 (Table 3). Hence those genes and miRNAs were taken into consideration to study their interaction at molecular level.
