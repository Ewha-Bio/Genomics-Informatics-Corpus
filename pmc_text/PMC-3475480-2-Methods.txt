Animals
BALB/c mice (Japan SLC, Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were bred in a pathogen-free facility and used at 7 to 9 weeks of age for siRNA injection. The mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature with free access to food and water. Every effort was made to minimize the number of animals that was used and their suffering per the Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee University (KHP-2010-04-06).
