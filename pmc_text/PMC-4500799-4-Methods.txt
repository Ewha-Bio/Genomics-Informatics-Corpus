Pfam
Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) is designed as a comprehensive and accurate collection of protein domains and families [16,17]. Pfam families are typed as Pfam-A and Pfam-B. Each Pfam-A family possess a curated seed alignment containing a small set of envoyed members of the family and an automatically created full alignment which contains all noticeable protein sequences belonging to the family, as defined by profile Hidden Markov Models searches of primary sequence databases. On the other hand, Pfam-B entries are automatically created from the ProDom database and are shown by a single alignment [18].
