For a fast-paced research environment, a viewer for searching and observing data in one step is very handy. We hope our system can help researchers who are interested not only in our target polymorphism study but also in a viewer for polymorphisms for general purposes.
We chose a web-based platform for the tool because of its usability and ease of maintenance. Since its workload is very small as an input query for a viewer, a web-based platform does not have drawbacks, like other calculation applications with very large data.
