The proportion of commonly found haplotype blocks based on the marker subset of 1000G dataset and the HapMap dataset compared to the entire 1000G SNP markers. Two haplotype blocks obtained from each of two datasets are said to be common blocks if Lo/Lw or Lo/Ls is greater than or equal to 0.8 where Lo is the length of overlapped region of a pair of haplotype blocks, Lw is the length of a block in entire data which overlapping with the block in sampled data, and Ls is the length of a block in sampled data which overlapping with the block in entire data. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; CI, confidence interval; FGT, four gamete test; SS, solid spine.
