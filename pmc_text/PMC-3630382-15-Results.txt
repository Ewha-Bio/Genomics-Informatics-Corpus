Discovery of LOH and SCAN by SCHALE
We had used SCHALE to discover LOH and SCNA. It appears that sample G06 has many LOHs and SCNAs, but an incorrect sample pair can give those results (Supplementary Fig. 3). We also discovered high LOH on chrX in G10 (Fig. 3).
We could not find any somatic mutations in G10. Previously, we had described that it could be contamination, but another possibility is that they are exomes from identical twins with different genders (we do not have any gender information from any samples).
Abnormal regions on chr1 in G05 showed LOH in the germline, but it is quite unnatural (Fig. 4). We are not describing much for this area until experimental validation is performed.
We had found one LOH region on chr13 in G05 (Fig. 5). INTS6 and KIAA1704 are located at both ends and potentially could make a fusion gene (Fig. 6). Experimental validation is also required for this assumption. INTS6 is expressed in blood; many expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were found in INTS6 in UniGene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene). But, KIAA1704 has a small number of ESTs, so we could not infer expression levels from UniGene. There are 61 genes on chr13:45,578,409-52,035,344, and we had an additional set of network and pathway analyses, including 6 genes (MAST2, L1TD1, MSH4, GATA2, VDAC2, and PHF6) with somatic mutations.
The top network is "Cancer, Hematological Disease, Immunological Disease," comprised of GATA2 and MAST2. Many genes in LOH regions are included in this network. We can infer that those genes with somatic mutations and LOH can interact with each other (Fig. 7).
