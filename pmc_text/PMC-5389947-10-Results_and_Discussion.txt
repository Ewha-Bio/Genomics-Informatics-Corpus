Impact Codons
Most amino acids can be specified by more than one codon. Nevertheless, in highly expressed genes, only a subset of potential codons is used (Table 3). There were no impact codons coding His in the presently studied crenarchaeal genomes. The impact codons in crenarchaeal genomes was found to be mostly used in coding Phe, Leu, Tyr, Glu, Ser, Ala, Trp, Pro, Arg, and Gly. Besides His, no impact codons coding Asp and Cys were found in crenarchaeal genomes. The data set investigated here revealed a strong bias of the usage of favored codons in highly expressed genes but lowly expressed gene displayed small amount of synonymous codon usage bias. It is hypothesized that codon translated using an abundant tRNA expedite translation efficiency and this translation selection gives birth of codon usage bias. Frequencies of different codons were noticed to differ between genes in the same genome and between genomes. Using 61 codons and three non-sense codons, almost all organisms have prepared the same codon assignments for each amino acid, but the favored use of individual codons differs to a great extent among genes. The overall nucleotide composition of the genome governed by codon usage pattern is hypothesized to commence selective forces acting on highly expressed genes to expedite translation efficiency. There were no impact codons coding Met, Val, Gln, and Asn in Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456 and Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2.
It was observed that the set of preferred (impact) codons in crenarchaeal genomes coding for Leu, Tyr, Lys, Glu, Arg, and Trp were ctt and ctc, tat and tac, aag, gag, aga and agg, and tgg, respectively. For mesophiles, atg and tcg were the preferential codons coding for Met and Ser while aag is the preferential codon coding for Lys in (hyper)thermophiles. It is important to notice that the distinguished preferred (impact) codons coding Arg and Ile separate mesophiles (cgc and atc) from (hyper)thermophiles (aga/agg and ata). There were no impact codons coding for Asp and Cys in crenarchaeal genomes. We observed that all favored (impact) codons were not GC rich in crenarchaeal genomes. So, GC3 could not accurately measure the bias in codon usage. It is generally acknowledged that bias in synonymous codon usage is influenced by the cellular amount of isoacceptor tRNA genes. In this study, we have noticed that all tRNA genes corresponding to impact codons have not been identified by tRNAscanSE and many tRNAs decode two or more codons, which indicates that impact codons may possibly influence translational efficiency. As the optimal set of favored codons is used in highly expressed genes, this observation could have significant role in improvement of tRNA finding algorithm.
