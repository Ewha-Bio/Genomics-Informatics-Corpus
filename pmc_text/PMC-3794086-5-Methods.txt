Semantic similarity between GO terms
The R package GOSemSim was developed to compute semantic similarity among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products, and gene clusters. This package contains functions to estimate the semantic similarity of GO terms based on Resnik's, Lin's, Jiang and Conrath's, Rel's, and Wang's methods. Here, we used Wang's method for our analysis. This method determines the semantic similarity of two GO terms based on both the locations of these terms in the GO graph and their relationships with their ancestor terms [12]. The similarity index between the two GO terms was between 0 (the least similar) and 1 (identical). The similarity between two sets of GO terms was calculated as follows. First, the highest value against all members of the other set was calculated for a given GO term in one of the sets. Then, all of these values were collected and averaged to provide the similarity between the two sets. The significance of the similarity index was inferred, based on the distribution of the indices from 106 random samplings.
