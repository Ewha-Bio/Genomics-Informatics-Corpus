Splicing regulation
Intron-exon boundary regions, also known as limited by the GU-AG rule, are important in carrying out splicing events [34]. Additionally, potential splicing enhancers (ESEs) or splicing silencers residing near intron-exon boundaries—i.e., DNA sequence motifs within an exon—are known to enhance or suppress splicing. Thus, some synonymous codons can participate as constituents of these motifs. Therefore, a synonymous mutation of a gene can affect the splicing of that gene, without any influence on amino acid changes in that gene. In fact, Takahashi (2009) [35] has shown in Drosophila that translationally optimal codons tend to be avoided within the ESE motifs, and compared codon usage biases of exons with those of ESE regions in the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene using codon bias indices, called CBI [35, 36]. Dscam is known as one of the genes with the largest number of alternatively spliced exons [35]. Furthermore, another study showed that almost none of the synonymous codons residing in ESEs was an optimal codon in the regulation of translational efficiency [37]. The same study showed that this conflict on the roles of synonymous codons between translational regulation and splicing control was larger in highly expressed genes [37].
