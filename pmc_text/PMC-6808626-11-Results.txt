Accuracy
We expect our service to perform well in situations where multi-word named entities cause problems for the parser. Below we demonstrate two examples in which our service performs well in such situations.
As Figs. 5 and 6 show, complex named entities are problematic for the dependency parser and tagger, causing it to tag “kinase” as a verb; when in fact it is part of the compound entity “Testis-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 4 (Tssk4).” This results in an incorrect parse tree.
The second example of Figs. 7 and 8 shows the case where the parse is not technically wrong, but convoluted and useless to downstream tasks.
