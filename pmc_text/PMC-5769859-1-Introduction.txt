It has been estimated that about 1.5% of human genomic DNA can be annotated as protein coding sequences [1]. So, more than 98% of the human genome does not encode protein [2, 3]. However, a large proportion of the genome transcribes non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [4, 5]. LncRNAs have important roles in different cellular and molecular mechanisms [6]. These long RNAs regulate the activity and position of epigenetic machinery during cell function and segregation [7]. In fact, some of the lncRNAs can recruit catalytic activity of chromatin-modifying proteins [8]. Dysregulation of lncRNAs has been also reported in cancer initiation and progression. However, the molecular mechanism and regulation of these RNAs have been remained to be unknown [9, 10].
Rinn et al. [11] identified HOTAIR lncRNA with a 2.2 kb length. HOTAIR gene is located in a region between HOX11 and HOX12 on chromosome 12q13.3 [12–16]. HOTAIR lncRNA binds to both polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) complexes, through its 5′-3′ domains and directs them to HOXD gene cluster as well as other genes in order to increase gene silencing by coupling the histone H3K27 trimethylation and H3K4 demethylation [17, 18].
HOTAIR is an oncogene RNA that is known to have potential role in several cancers. Its overexpression is reported in different solid tumors such as breast, gastric, and colorectal tumors [19, 20]. The oncogenic role of HOTAIR is reported in different mechanisms such as cell proliferation, invasion, aggression, and metastasis of the tumor cells as well as inhibition of apoptosis [3, 21–25]. In spite of different reports on the potential oncogenic role of HOTAIR, the molecular regulation of this gene needs to be revealed by more studies.
Since the genetic and epigenetic complexities of the HOTAIR locus have not been characterized yet, we aimed to provide an integration data to highlight different compositional features of HOTAIR gene. The potential model may help to design future studies to reveal the molecular mechanisms of this lncRNA. In this study, we highlighted and described a number of features in HOTAIR locus, which may be involved in regulation of this gene. The integrated report is derived from the in silico approaches through different databases and software.
