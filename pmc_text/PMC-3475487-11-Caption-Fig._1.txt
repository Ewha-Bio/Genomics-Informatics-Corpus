Conserved Domain Tree (CDTree) involving CysQ (cgd2_1810) protein. (A) Whole hierarchy of Fig superfamily. Branch colors indicate Eukaryota (pink), Bacteria (bright blue), and Archaea (orange) domains; Cryptosporidium parvum sequence is added (red branch and circle). On the right side, color bar marked with domain accession names displays subfamilies in Fig superfamily. All CDs except for cd01637 are well clustered. cd01637 is scattered around the tree and highlighted in black ticks. (B) CDTree of cd01638 domain. The cd01638 clade that includes only bacteria is classified by taxonomic lineage. Bacteria are subdivided into two distinct parts, gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Each bacterial phylum is colored as shown in legend. CysQ protein of C. parvum is shown in red dashed branch with a red circle near Proteobacteria.
