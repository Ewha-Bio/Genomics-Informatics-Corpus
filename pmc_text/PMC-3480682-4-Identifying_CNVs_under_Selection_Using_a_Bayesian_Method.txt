Identifying selection
Identifying candidate CNVs under natural selection using locus-specific estimates of FST is of great interest, in view of our increased knowledge of the relationships among human populations from genome-wide patterns of variation. The logic for identifying selection is straightforward. The pattern of genetic differentiation at a neutral locus is completely determined by the demographic history, migration rates among the populations, and the mutation rates at the loci. It is reasonable to assume that all autosomal loci have experienced the same demographic history and migration rates among the populations, and the observed population structure can be largely explained by random drift at neutral loci. However, as the individuals from different populations often vary genetically at a few key sites in their genome, loci showing unusually large amounts of differentiation may indicate regions of the genome that have been subject to positive selection, whereas loci showing unusually small amounts of differentiation may indicate regions of the genome that have been subject to stabilizing (balancing) selection [15, 22-24]. Thus, the outlier method makes it possible to detect divergences in some loci of the genome due to selection.
