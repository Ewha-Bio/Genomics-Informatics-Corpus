Comparison of the compositions of viral assemblages identified in Korean environments. The percentages of viral families in each virome indicate the assignments of the metagenomic sequences to viral families. The amplification methods used in each study are designated as follows: M, multiple displacement amplification; L, linker-amplified shotgun library.
