Toxoplasma gondii is an Apicomplexan intracellular parasite and is a causative agent of toxoplasmosis in human. It also plays a key role over a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, like encephalitis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital infections [1]. It infects the host by various modes, such as intake of undercooked meat containing T. gondii cysts, consumption of contaminated water, and food defilement with feces from infected cats, and may also spread through blood transfusion [23]. The sexual reproduction of T. gondii occurs in domestic cats, which are considered a definite host [4]. The asexual reproduction of this parasite occurs in intermediate hostsâ€”namely, humans, cattle, and birds [5]. The establishment of host-parasite interactions is crucial for parasite survival, as it depends on host nutritive resources. Apicomplexan parasites implement a unique host cell invasion mechanism, wherein they anchor the host cell by forming multimeric protein machinery, called a moving junction (MJ) complex [6]. This complex is formed by interprotein interactions established between two types of proteins-namely, rhoptry neck proteins 2/4/5/8 (RON 2, 4, 5, and 8) proteins secreted by rhoptry organelle of the parasite onto the host membrane and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), secreted by micronemes [789]. The molecular association of RON2 and AMA1 is essential for initiating the host invasion process.
