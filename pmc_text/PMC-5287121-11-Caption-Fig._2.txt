Ratio of standard errors of RA and T1D association analyses. Left panel shows log10 values of the ratio of the two standard errors from the two studies participating in a meta-analysis (RA and T1D). Right panel shows the âˆ’log10 values of p-values of two different meta-analysis methods (IVW and SZ_N) for combining the two studies (RA and T1D). (A) Both RA and T1D analyses used logistic regression. (B) Both RA and T1D analyses used linear mixed model using GEMMA. (C) RA analysis used linear mixed model and T1D analysis used logistic regression. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; T1D, type 1 diabetes; IVW, inverse variance-weighted average method; SZ_N, SZ whose weights are given as the square root of sample size.
