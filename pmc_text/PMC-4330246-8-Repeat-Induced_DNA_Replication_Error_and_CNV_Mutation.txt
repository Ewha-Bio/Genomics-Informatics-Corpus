Self-chains in CNV formation
The aforementioned SDs are long (>1 kb) and LCRs in the human genome. Besides SDs, self-chains (SCs) are another type of short LCRs, which were previously analyzed and mapped via self-alignment in the human genome utilizing BLASTZ [63, 64]. SCs are short in length (91% of which range from 150 bp to 1 kb in size) [14]. Furthermore, SCs have a limited number of matched alignments in the human genome. Thus, SCs represent a distinct category of human short LCRs.
In 2013, Chen et al. [65] studied deletion CNVs in the NRXN1 gene and its flanking regions. After mapping and analyzing the breakpoints of 32 deletions, they found a significant bias that minus SCs (i.e., paired SCs in the inverted orientation) were overrepresented in the vicinity of deletion breakpoints in the NRXN1 region. Furthermore, they claimed that the SCs can increase genomic instability and cause deletions via DNA replication errors. Their work contributes to the exploration on SC-mediated CNVs.
To perform a genomewide analysis on the contribution of SCs to human CNV instability, Zhou et al. [14] plotted the numbers of SC regions with different orientations in the entire human genome. After masking the SDs and gaps in the human genome, utilizing the germline CNVs in human populations and the somatic CNVs in various cancer genomes, they observed a significant biased distribution of CNV breakpoints to SC regions, which indicated that SC-mediated secondary structures may induce DNA replication errors and potentially generate different types of CNVs, such as deletions and duplications. In this case, SCs represent a new genomic architecture for the underlying regional susceptibility to genomic instability, further giving rise to CNVs.
