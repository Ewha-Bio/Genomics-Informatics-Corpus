IABio service architecture
Fig. 3 shows the authorization processing procedure of the token method and the service contents that each user is provided in the use case diagram.
Four actors consist of a researcher, database, web portal, and authorization server. A researcher accesses the authorization system to have access to the IABio platform and requests an access token. The authorization server confirms the legitimacy of the access by the user and issues the right access token for his/her authority. Then, the researcher acquires the access token.
The researcher proceeds to access the IABio platform through a portal. The web portal and database identify the access token. When the login is done properly, the user can input and output data. Data can be entered according to information related to a concerned genome. Genome input data are analyzed, and the analyzed information is saved.
The researcher requests data output to monitor the analysis results and related data. Token authorization contents are analyzed for a second time to check if the researcher is legitimate for data confirmation before the analysis results and entered information are retrieved.
