Study populations
We obtained the high-resolution CNV data by Conrad et al. [4] from the Database of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/). The dataset consists of 90 Han Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT), 180 Caucasians of European descent (CEU), and 180 Yoruba (YRI) samples. Among the 450 individuals, we removed 19 individuals with more than 400 missing CNV genotypes. Each CNV was analyzed as biallelic dominant data, classified as neutral versus non-neutral (losses or gains).
