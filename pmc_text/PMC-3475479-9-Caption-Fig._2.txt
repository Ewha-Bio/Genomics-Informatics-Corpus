Integrated pipeline for de novo assembly of novel genome sequencing. The scheme is filtering data to remove low-quality and shot-read initial assemblies using variable software and compare to contigs, hybrid contigs using MIRA assembler, and contig ordering using SSPACE software to scaffold construction.
