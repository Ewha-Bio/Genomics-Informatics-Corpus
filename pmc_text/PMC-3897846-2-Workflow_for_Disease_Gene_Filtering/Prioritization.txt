Typically, the output from NGS platforms is in the standard FASTQ format. The FASTQ file is a text file containing a list of short DNA fragments, generally less than 150 base pairs (bp) long, and a list of quality scores associated with the DNA fragments. For whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing, a FASTQ file contains millions of records. For example, the human exome is ~50 million base pairs (Mbp), and a typical whole-exome sequencing dataset has at least 30X depth of coverage (i.e., each bp is sequenced 30 times on average). Such a FASTQ file will contain ~15 million raw 100-bp sequences. To identify the causal genes from this raw data, a variant gene prioritization pipeline usually involves three stages or phases of data processing: 1) raw sequence processing and mapping, 2) variant discovery and genotyping, and 3) disease gene filtering and/or prioritization.
