Hybridization: PCR and blocking oligonucleotides
Hybridization of the array was performed as previously described [4,12]. In brief, cells were collected during the pooled growth experiments, and their genomic DNA was prepared from frozen cell stocks. For each PCR sample, 10–20 OD600 (2–4×108 cells/mL) were used. For amplification and labelling of gene-specific tags, PCR was performed with the indicated sets of universal PCR primers (as shown by the pairs of head-to-head arrows in Fig. 1A) using 0.2 µg of genomic DNA as a template. PCR amplification was performed through 30 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94℃, annealing at 55℃, and extension at 72℃ for 30 s for each step in a total volume of 100 µL (2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, and 1 µM each primer mix). Hybridization was carried out using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 (Pasadena, CA, USA).
As shown in Fig. 1D, only anti-sense strands of PCR products (shown as the filled rectangles with white dots) labeled with biotin (shown as the asterisks) were used for hybridization against sense-strand probes (shown as the dotted rectangles) tiled on the chip. In addition, for each tag, four priming sequences were shielded by blocking oligonucleotides (shown as rectangles in gray; refer to the previous report [4] for the sequence information), which prevented melted strands from re-associating.
