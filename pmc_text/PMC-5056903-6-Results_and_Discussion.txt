Structural model and evaluation of NA receptor
NA protein of H1N1 is of length of 469 amino acids sequence. Due to unavailability of experimentally determined structure of selected NA protein, tertiary structure was predicted using the Phyre2 web server. Two templates were used to predict the 3D structures of NA protein (Fig. 2A), such as D chain of H5N1 NA in complex with oseltamivir (Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 2HU4) [30] and D chain of I223R NA mutant structure (PDB ID: 4B7Q) [31]. The predicted structure was then subjected to the YASARA Energy Minimization Server for structural refinement. The total energy for the refined structure obtained from the YASARA Energy Minimization Server for NA was –194,023.8 kJ/mol (score, –2.68) where prior to energy minimization, it was 25,622,682,021,439 kJ/mol (score, –7.17). The stereochemistry of the refined model of NA (ProCheck analysis) (Fig. 2B) revealed that 94.4% residues were situated in the most favorable region and additional allowed regions and 1.8% of residues were in the generously allowed region, whereas 3.8% the residues fell in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2B). ProSA-web evaluation revealed a compatible Z score value of NA was obtained to be –4.89 (Fig. 2C) which is well within the range of native conformations of crystal structures. The overall residual energies of the NA tertiary model were largely negative except for few peaks. The 3D model of H1N1 NA protein showed a Levitt-Gerstein (LG) score of 4.183 and Maxus 0.060 by Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool, implying a high accuracy level of the predicted structure. A ProQ LG score > 2.5 is necessary for suggesting that a model is of very good quality [24]. Similar assumptions were achieved using the ERRAT plot where the overall quality factor for NA was observed to be 13.015 (Fig. 2D). All of these outcomes recommended the reliability of the proposed model.
