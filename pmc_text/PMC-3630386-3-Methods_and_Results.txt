Web-based interfaces of the EDD
First, all protein and nucleic acid sequences identified as DNAJ/Ks can be accessed according to class, species, and cluster through user-friendly interfaces, such as the 'class' and 'cluster' browsers on the EDD website. For example, statistics pages of each class were displayed using tables and diagrams in the 'class' browser. The statistics pages are automatically updated when new data are added to the EDD. Secondly, the EDD allows users to browse the detailed information on DNAJ/Ks and to analyze it via 'favorite'. It is a customized cyber-workbench where users can create folders, store favored items, and perform 10 bioinformatics analyses, such as BLAST search, BLASTMatrix, ClustalW, DNAJ/K statistics, a DNAJ class viewer, a DNAJ/K domain viewer, and a glycine ratio viewer. Especially, 'favorite', implemented in the EDD, is specialized for the functional analysis of DNAJ/K proteins (e.g., DNAJ/K domain view). The data saved in 'favorite' can be shared with CFGP 2.0 for further comparative analysis [16]. Finally, a highlighted function of the EDD is a 'taxonomy' browser powered by the 'Species-driven User Interface', which provides an interactive interface for displaying the taxonomical hierarchy for DNAJ/Ks. Users can drag and drop any taxon or taxa and perform sequence download, statistics, class and cluster analyses, ClustalW alignment, and BLAST search.
