The purpose of our analysis is, first, to explore the potential to combine the functionalities of PubAnnotation, the LAPPS Grid, and INCEpTION in order to provide a state-of-the-art means for researchers to access, annotate, and eventually mine scientific publications. The scientific community desperately needs an easy-to-use, powerful platform that enables not only access to publication texts, but also rapid development of annotated corpora to support machine learning. This is especially needed so that text mining systems across disciplines and/or tuned to specific domains and sub-areas can be developed. A second motivation for our analysis is to identify obstacles to cross-platform interoperability for natural language processing in general, which can potentially inform design and implementation choices for future systems. We see the ability to combine the functionalities of existing platforms as an important element of progress in the field, to avoid reinventing the wheel as well as modularize component capabilities, thereby reducing the overhead of maintaining monolithic systems and distributing effort as well as cost.
