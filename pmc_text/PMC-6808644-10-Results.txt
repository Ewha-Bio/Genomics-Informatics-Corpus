Implementation and computational resources
FusionScan algorithm was developed using Java (JDK1.7) and Python languages. It further requires many third-party programs such as Bowtie2, SSAHA2, BLAT, bl2seq, samtools and FASTX-Toolkit. Thus, it is highly recommended to run FusionScan in Linux environment with the Java Runtime Environment 1.7 or later.
We measured the CPU time and memory usage the K562 RNA-Seq data are compared in Fig. 5. FusionScan and SOAPfuse took the longest CPU time mainly to achieve the high recall rates. For example, quality trimming with the option of ‘-t 20 –l 40’ instead of ‘-t 10 –l 38’ decreased the run time by half in FusionScan, but lost a few true positives in benchmark testing with 3 cell line datasets. Measuring the CPU time spent for each step of workflow, the preprocessing and mapping took almost half of the total CPU time.
