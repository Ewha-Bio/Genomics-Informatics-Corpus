Schematic physical map, haplotypes and linkage disequilibrium (LD) plot of TEC. (A) Polymorphisms identified in TEC. Coding exons are marked by shaded blocks and untranslated region by white blocks. The LD coefficients (r2) are based on the genotypes of Korean samples. (B) Haplotypes are calculated using genotypes of TEC polymorphisms in a Korean population. Only those with frequencies over 0.05 are shown in tables. Haplotypes with frequencies lower than 0.05 are merged into "Others." (C) LD coefficients (|D'|) among the selected SNPs based on the genotypes of whole study subjects in this study.
