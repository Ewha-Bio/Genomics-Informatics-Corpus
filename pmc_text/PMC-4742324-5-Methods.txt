Analysis of SNP effects
To identify non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs), we analyzed SNP effects using the SNPeffect database, which detects phenotypic effects of variation (http://snpeffect.vib.be/) [20]. For more exact results, a Fisher's exact test was performed to identify breed-specific amino acids in genes with nsSNPs. The statistical test was used to analyze 2 × 2 contingency tables composed with two factors. Considering our purpose, one factor was breed information, and the other was amino acid information. From the 2 × 2 contingency tables, we expected to observe enrichment of specific amino acids in specific breeds at each position. All data parsing and calculations were performed using Python (ver. 2.5) and R (ver. 3.1.2).
