Subject classification and study flow
After pharmacokinetics and safety assessment of the original first-in-human clinical study, the subjects were clearly classified into two groups, namely, slow and fast metabolizers (Fig. 1). After the classification, genomic marker exploration was performed by pharmacogenomic analysis and metabolic pathway identification was performed by drug pharmacometabolomic analysis. The genomic marker data was integrated with metabolic pathway data to understand the mechanism of the inter-individual variability. The overall study flow is presented in Fig. 2.
