Association analyses
Genome-wide association was analyzed using the PLINK software (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink). The association between genotypes and concentration of liver enzymes in plasma was evaluated with linear regression analysis, controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) as covariates. The Manhattan plots of -log10 (p-value) were made using Haploview v. 4.2. The quantile-quantile plots were generated using R statistics package to assess the overall significance of the genome-wide associations.
