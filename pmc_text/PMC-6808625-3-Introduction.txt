The problem
Medical documents mentioning drugs and chemical compounds offer a relevant source of information regarding the patientsâ€™ treatment. For instance, doctors and researchers may be interested in finding health records of patients treated with a particular kind of compound in order to manually analyze them or use them in biomedical NLP pipelines. Nevertheless, the task of manually detecting these entities would be expensive and time-consuming, which prompts for the development of NER systems for automating this task. In the context of chemical compounds, NER is usually referred to as chemical entity recognition (CER).
