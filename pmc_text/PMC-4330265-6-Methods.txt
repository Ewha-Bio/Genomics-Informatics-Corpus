Model building
3D structure determination of a protein is the key step of structural genomics initiative [13]. To predict the 3D homology model of phosphoglucosamine mutase, Phyre2 (Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine) [14], the most popular online protein fold identification server, was used. Phyre2 uses a dataset of known proteins taken from different reliable databases, such as Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database and Protein Data Bank (PDB). Through sequential steps, such as profile construction, similarity analysis, and structural properties, Phyre2 selects the best suited template and generates a protein model. To get an accurate model, intensive mode of protein modeling was selected. The input data of this enzyme were in FASTA format. In this respect, the intensive mode of protein modeling was selected in order to get an accurate model. After model building, it is necessary to further refine in quest of the best model generation.
