DNA sequence analysis
BLAST sequence homology searches were also performed against the GenBank database after subtracting the vector sequence. Subsequently, 1,260 single colonies from the Prebiocide library and 2,600 single colonies from the Tank A library were picked. The major sequences encoding specific genes were then identified from the Prebiocide (26 clones), Tank A (27 clones), and control samples (21 clones) on the basis of the GenBank protein sequences. Supplementary Table 1 shows representative BLAST search results from GenBank for the Prebiocide, Tank A, and control sample clones.
