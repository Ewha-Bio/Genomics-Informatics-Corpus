Sequence alignment (step 4)
The first step in ChIP-Seq data analysis is to align fastq files to a reference genome. The names of fastq files and the reference genome information (either a fasta file or BSgenome package) should be provided. As mapping is a time-consuming job, parallel processing using multiple cores is highly recommended. In R, parallel programming is supported by the 'BiocParallel' package, found at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocParallel.html. QuasR, the abbreviation for ‘Quantify and Annotate Short Reads,’ provides a framework for the quantification and analysis of short reads. ‘qAlign’ is the function that generates alignment files in BAM format for all input sequence files against the reference genome. The qAlign function is a wrapper for the bowtie [3] and SpliceMap [13] tools.
