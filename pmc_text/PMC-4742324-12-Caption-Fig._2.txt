Visualization of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects on positively selected genes. (A) Visualization of the sequence logo for the SLA-DQA1 gene with 13 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) showing evidence of positive selection in Duroc. (B) Visualization of enrichment tests for the 13 nsSNPs. The red box indicates the significant positive selection regions under the Bonferroni adjusted p-value < 0.05.
