Addiction genome database
A genome database has many merits, such as predicting the occurrence of disease and thus preventing and swiftly diagnosing it, which leads to early treatment; determining the prognosis accurately by selecting the treatment of a certain gene; and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment.
It has been difficult to verify the connection between addiction and genes in the past, but some attempts have been made to identify the DNA responsible for addiction in the last decade. The findings say that when a genetic mutation occurs in a certain region of dopamine receptor in a human brain, dopamine receptor fails to function properly and thus can have superficial behavioral inclinations, such as addiction to smoking, alcohol, or drugs [8].
According to those studies, when genetic mutation occurs in a certain region of dopamine receptor in a human brain, dopamine receptor fails to function properly, and when the mutated genes make contact with a substance, they secrete acetylcholine, which stimulates pleasure, which leads to addiction. The genes known to be related to addiction are DRD2 Tag 1A, DRD2 Tag 1B, and so on. A German psychobiologic research team examined and compared 132 internet addicts and 711 normal people to find the cause of addiction and found that most of the addicts had a mutated gene called CHRNA4NA4 [9].
It is necessary that a database be built for addiction and that a service provision environment be established for studies regarding IA. Therefore, an integrated database is required to support genome research and analysis.
