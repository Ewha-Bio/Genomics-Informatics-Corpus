Long-read DNA structure to store digital data. Short DNA fragments (size, 16 bp) that represent 0 or 1 will be located in a data block in a sequential order to represent digital information. ’Start’ and ’End’ are DNA sequences that mark the start and end of the data block, respectively. Flanking restriction sites are introduced for further ligation of long-read DNA to another.
