Germline SNP analysis was done to detect germline heterozygous mutations that are carried by AML patients. To address this issue, germline SNP analysis was performed using the UCSC hg19 program in 10 AML patients (samples G1 to G10) (Table 1). We chose 18 major genes (TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, CEBPA, PHF6, WT1, TP53, EZH2, RUNX1, PTEN, FLT3, NPM1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, KIT, IDH1, and IDH2) to be analyzed in 10 samples (Table 2). Among these 18 genes, KRAS and DNMT3A seemed to play a critical role in the progression of AML, associated with the chemotherapy response. KRAS is a protein product of the normal KRAS gene, which performs an essential function in normal tissue signaling, and the mutation of a KRAS gene is an essential step in the development of many cancers [4]. DNMT3A is a key component of the epigenetic regulation of genes, as it catalyzes the addition of methyl groups to the cytosine residue of CpG dinucleotides [5]. However, variations only in KRAS and DNMT3A are not enough to explain the mechanism of AML progression, since additional somatic changes exist in AML patients.
SNPs of KRAS were detected in 4 different individuals (G2, G6, G7, and G8), as shown in Table 1, while those of DNMT3A were detected in 5 individuals (G3, G4, G6, G8, and G10) among 10 AML patients (Table 1). Patients G6 and G8 showed SNPs in both KRAS and DNMT3A. We then searched for somatic mutations of each individual in order to prove the 'two-hit' theory. Table 3 shows the results of the somatic mutation analysis. SNPs of KRAS and DNMT3A were detected in both samples G6 and G8 (Table 3). However, they had different clinical courses after the first induction. They both attained a CR after the first induction; however, G6 relapsed within 390 days after attaining remission, while G8 did not relapse for 402 days. We suggested that an additional somatic mutation may have affected the clinical courses above. A somatic mutation in IDH2 was identified in both G6 and G8, while that of FLT3 and NPM1 was detected in G6 and G8, respectively. FLT3 mutation is known as a bad prognostic factor in AML [6]. NPM1 mutation, on the other hand, is usually known as a good prognostic factor in AML [7]. Therefore, we could speculate that SNPs (KRAS and DNMT3A) with additional somatic mutations (FLT3 and NPM1) affect the prognosis of AML differentially.
In addition, G2 and G7 shared the same SNPs in KRAS but their clinical courses showed a striking difference (Table 4). G7 had an additional germline SNP in KIT. This patient never attained CR despite intensive chemotherapy. As we searched further for somatic mutations in G7, a somatic mutation in TET2 was detected as a second hit. On the other hand, an NPM1 mutation was observed in G2, showing a divergent outcome compared with G7. G2 attained CR after the first induction of chemotherapy and did not relapse.
We observed a divergent outcome in patients having the same SNPs but with different somatic mutations as a second hit. Somatic mutations that were differentially detected at the time of diagnosis strongly suggest clinical implications and warrant future study in a larger cohort to enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression in AML.
