Reference genome mapping
About 98% of reads were mapped onto the human reference genome (UCSC Genome Browser, hg19), summarized in Supplementary Table 2. After a duplicate removal step, 77.85% reads were retained; each sample had up to 25% duplicates. Eighty-nine percent of target areas covered at least 10 sequence reads, which is sufficient for discovering somatic mutations. We did not get target enrichment kit information from PGM21, so we had compared coverage information from several kits and concluded that SureSelect All Exon 50Mb was used for exome sequencing.
