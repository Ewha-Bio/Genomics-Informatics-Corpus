Clinical assessment and definitions
For this study, metabolic syndrome is defined according to the International Diabetes Federation’s criteria for the South Asian ethnic group [27], that is, the presence of at least 3 of the following metabolic risk factors: increased waist circumference (males ≥ 90 cm; females ≥ 80 cm); elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mm Hg or the use of medications for hypertension); elevated fasting glucose levels (fasting glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL or the use of medications for hyperglycemia); elevated triglyceride levels (≥150 mg/dL); and reduced HDL cholesterol levels (males < 40 mg/dL, females < 50 mg/dL) or being under treatment for dyslipidemia. The metabolic score is the sum of the number of metabolic risk factors. Alcohol consumption was defined as yes when more than 140 g of alcohol was consumed per week, and smoking status was categorized as no or ex-smokers vs. current smoker. Exercise was grouped as not active vs. physically active. Physically active was defined as performing at least 150 minutes of vigorous or moderate intensity active per week. The study was conducted in nonobese individuals whose body mass index (BMI) was less than 25 kg/m2.
