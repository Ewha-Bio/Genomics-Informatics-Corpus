Prediction of protein structure and its validation
Phyre2 server [28] was employed for modeling of the tertiary structure of E6 protein followed by energy minimization using YASARA Energy Minimization Server [29]. Further the protein three dimension structure in pdb format was subjected to SCWRL4.0 software [30] for protein side chain modeling before docking. Procheck [31], ProSA-web [32], and ProQ [33] server were used for assessing the model reliability which further verified by ERRAT server [34].
