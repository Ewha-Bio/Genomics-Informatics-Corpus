CNV discovery
CNV discovery consisted of two steps: CNV calling and determination of the CNV region. For CNV calling, we used a package, called “Genome Alteration Detection Analysis (GADA),” which implements a flexible and efficient pipeline to detect copy number alterations from microarray data [20]. To avoid a limitation caused in the single detection tool, we found the best parameter (T = 10, alpha = 0.2, and Min-SegLen = 10) that compared a known CNV region and CNVs tested using several parameters [21]. CNV was employed as the average log2 ratio of ±0.25 of probes in all individual. To estimate CNV genotypes, a CNV region was defined with a log2 ratio identified between the reference sample and test sample in the calling process. It is hard to define exact genotype cluster of a CNV detected in a single individual. To discover CNV regions, we employed CNVs that were called in over three individuals [22].
