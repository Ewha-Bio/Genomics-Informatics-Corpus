Protein structure prediction and validation of rpoB
Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine (Phyre2) server [18] was used for modeling the three-dimensional structure of rpoB. Phyre2 is an automatic fold recognition server that predicts the three-dimensional structure of a protein sequence using the principles and techniques of homology modeling. The Phyre is widely used by the biological community, with more than 150 submissions per day [18]. The Phyre2 server was publicly released in February 2011 as a replacement for the original Phyre server and provides extra functionality over Phyre, a more advanced interface, and a fully updated fold library and uses the HHpred/HHsearch package for homology detection. Two mutants of rpoB (S450L and H445Y) were generated using Modeller9v10 [19]. Structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted models were carried out using the Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application (YASARA) Energy Minimization Server [20]. The refined model reliability was assessed through Procheck [21], ProSA-web [22], and ProQ [23].
