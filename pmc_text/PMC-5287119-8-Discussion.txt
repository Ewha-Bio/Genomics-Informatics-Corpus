The analysis of gene-gene interactions on a genome-wide scale is computationally very intensive, and many computational and statistical approaches have been recently proposed to minimize the computational burden. We found that BOOST is highly computationally efficient and can filter out non-significant interaction pairs in a fast manner.
In this study, we proposed an efficient strategy to identify interactions in genome-wide SNP data. We first utilized the screening stage of BOOST to filter out non-significant pairs and then used logistic regression with several covariates, such as age, sex, BMI, and PC scores.
In real data analysis, we used the KARE cohort dataset to detect gene-gene interactions of T2D. The smallest p-value (3.11E-11) of interaction pairs in the KARE data was found for rs1402142 and rs8012584. The Bonferroni-adjusted genome-wide significance level is 1.08e-12, and this SNP pair is not significant genome-wide. This insignificance is partially attributable to the insufficient sample size. With advances in genotyping/sequencing technology, genotyping costs will be much lower, and therefore, in the near future, sufficiently large samples will become available for genegene interaction analyses, which may lead us to a better understanding of human diseases.
