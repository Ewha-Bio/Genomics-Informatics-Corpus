Receptor grid generation for exhaustive search
The receptor grid for docking was generated by assigning the entire hydrophobic cleft region of AMA1 to which the RON2 binds, thereby performing an exhaustive cavity search towards achieving an optimal ligand binding pose. The residues spanning the RON2 binding cavity were noted from the Dimplot generated for the AMA1-RON2 complex [16]. The van der Waals radii for the receptor were assigned with a scaling factor of 1.0 and a partial cutoff of 0.25. The grid-assigned residues were Leu99, Val105, Leu109, Tyr110, Arg111, Val142, Phe143, Thr144, Glu145, Leu155, Asn162, Thr165, Gln169, Arg170, Ile171, Asn182, Asn184, Leu200, Thr201, Val202, Ala203, Met204, Tyr213, Tyr215, Tyr230, Ser232, Met233, Met236, Tyr241, Thr252, Trp253, Gln338, Phe339, and Gln361.
