The prototype has been used for analyzing the biomedical and genomic datasets of 100 ALL cancer patients, from the perspectives of domain knowledge and technologies. In spite of the size limitation of the dataset due to the expensive data collection, the discovery is quite encouraging in the case of ALL patients. This pilot result will place a foundation, enabling further enhancement and discovery using more comprehensive datasets and/or clinical trials.
On the basis that patients who cluster together will have genotypically similar tumors, it is then anticipated that newly diagnosed and as yet untreated patients will be compared directly to local 'biologically' similar neighbors. By comparing the management and treatment outcomes for patients in this manner, the analyst (i.e., clinician) can glean specific information from the local neighbors that will assist with their clinical decision making for the individual patient, moving towards the 'personalization' of medicine. The analysis has partially confirmed this accuracy of the similarity space. To illustrate this, Fig. 11A highlights three patients with the red-dash ellipses, where the deceased patient ALL123 is at the top left and the surviving patients ALL26 and ALL302 are located close to each other at the near-bottom right. These patients have similar clinical presentations, such as all being stratified as high-risk, but diverse outcomes. Fig. 11B shows the detailed views of the biomedical and genomic data of the three selected patients, showing the significant difference in gene expression values of patient ALL123 in comparison with ALL26 and ALL302. This property may explain the differences in treatment outcome of the three patients despite the similar clinical presentation and treatment regimen. The interactive heatmap visualization of the expanded set of SNPs and gene expression probe sets used in the array platforms allows the analyst to examine each specific genetic attribute represented by the 250 features (Fig. 11C) that further confirm the hypothesis.
We also carried out an analysis for different groups of patients. The experiments also confirm the effectiveness of the similarity space. For example, the genetic analysis of four clusters of patients (see Fig. 5) has unveiled that all probe sets of the gene MKI67 of the patients in cluster 0 (at the bottom-left and painted with a light-pink color) are significantly different from the others (see Fig. 12). Further visualization with the probe set mapping across the patient's population has confirmed this property (see Fig. 5). Details of the other findings (and the confirmation of the prognoses) are described further as follows.
There is little coherence between the genomic property and the biomedical property, such as risk, dead, or survival rate. Similar patients in terms of background and clinical information might have significant differences in their genetic properties. For example, Fig. 13 illustrates the details of several genes of interest for the four patients: ALL92, ALL129, ALL323, and ALL321. The patients' clinical properties are similar, including MR, male, deceased, and Study 8 protocol. However, the Affymetrix expression microarrays and Illumina SNPs values are quite varied among these patients.
Early treatments are more effective than late treatments (see Fig. 14). Particularly, there was only one death out of 19 cases (95% chance of survival from the disease) if the treatment was started within 5 years after birth. The dead case also happened to a very high-risk patient who was unlikely to survive because of the disease. If the treatment was started after 5 years but within 10 years from birth, the survival rate is 86% (3 deaths out of 22 cases), and if the treatment was used after 10 years from birth, the survival rate reduces significantly to 69% (4 deaths out of 13 cases).
Among the very high-risk patients ALL123, ALL143, ALL144, and ALL302 (top-left), patient ALL302 (near bottom-right) was the only survivor whose genetic property was significantly different from the others (at the top-left). Further examination using the 250 GOIs illustrated in Fig. 15 confirms this hypothesis for the expression values, especially for the genes ABHD10, LEPREL1, CNOT4, CHD9, EPOR, RASAL2, ZNF141, and SLC25A31. The variation at a particular gene or a combination of these genes might have contributed to the survival rate or an improvement in treatment. This finding can be verified by further analysis using larger and more comprehensive datasets and, ultimately, the actual proof of the clinical experiments.
Patients who were born in later years have a better chance of survival. For example, the rate of survival for those patients born after 1995 was approximately 94% while the rate for those patients born before 1995 was approximately 83%. This property reflects the improvement in treatment technology, treatment methodology, and living conditions.
Female patients tend to fare better than male patients overall (see Fig. 16). There is a 92.5% chance of survival in females (3 dead cases out of 40) versus an 88.3% chance of survival in males (7 dead cases out of 60).
The Study 8 protocol is dominant. The BFM 95 protocol is mostly applied to standard- to medium-risk patients who were born before 2000. The Study 8 protocol is a much more popular method, and it was used for patients regardless of risk strategies and age. Fig. 17 shows the protocols used in ALL treatment, including Study 8 (green), BFM 95 (blue), Interfant 99 (orange), and others (red).
Chemotherapy is more effective in treatment. It is interesting that nearly one-half of all patients did not have any treatments (or there were no treatment records) on record. The untreated patients mostly have standard to MRs. The bone marrow transplant treatment method has little effect on the survival rate (only 1 out of 5 cases survived). The most commonly chosen treatment method is chemotherapy, the survival rate for which is over 90% (see Fig. 18).
