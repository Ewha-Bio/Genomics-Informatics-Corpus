Genome-wide association dataset analyses
Genotyping was done using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples with gender inconsistencies and low call rates (<96%) were excluded.
Quality control (QC) procedures were performed using PLINK version 1.07 [32]. Samples were excluded if there was a high missing call rate (>5%), low minor allele frequency (<0.05), or significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1 Ã— 10-6). The total genotyping rate of the remaining individuals was 99.58%. A total of 312,121 autosomal SNPs were obtained after QC, representing 8,842 individuals (4,183 males and 4,659 females). An additive model was used for the analysis. Detailed information on the quality control procedure of the genotypes is described elsewhere by Cho et al. [16].
