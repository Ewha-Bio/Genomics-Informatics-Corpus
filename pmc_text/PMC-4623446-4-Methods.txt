Supported analysis methods
Our system currently contains statistical survival analysis methods for identifying a signature associated with cancer outcome and estimating its predictive value, i.e., the Cox proportional hazard model, log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves. Detailed methodologies are available in the previous methodology paper [11]. In addition, the system determines the significance of a molecule using bar plots illustrating the landscape of intensities among patients and two or more group box plots with a p-value obtained from a two sample t test or ANOVA methods.
