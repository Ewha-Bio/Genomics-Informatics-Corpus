Isolation of genomic DNA
Approximately 500 mL each of the Prebiocide and Tank A water samples was concentrated using several Amicon Ultra-15 filters (50K NMWL; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The filtered concentrates were combined together and further concentrated to 100 µL by using a vacuum evaporator (HT-4 II Evaporation system; Genevac Inc., Valley Cottage, NY, USA) at 28℃ for 2 h. DNA isolation was conducted using Trizol reagent, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). During the last step, the DNA pellets were dissolved in 10 µL of 8 mM NaOH and then incubated at 60℃ for 10 min.
