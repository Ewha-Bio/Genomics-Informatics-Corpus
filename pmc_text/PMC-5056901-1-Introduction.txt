Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease that can, in principle, affect any kind of body organ or cell, primarily in young women [1]. In SLE, altered immune responses may stimulate the production of autoantibodies and immune complex deposits in body organs, resulting in organ damage [2]. Like other autoimmune diseases, SLE has a complex pathogenesis, and the disease mechanism is still unclear; however, it is widely accepted that genetic factors could be important contributors to SLE [23]. Accordingly, several lines of evidence have supported that SLE may be explained by genetic factors. For instance, the concordance rate of SLE in monozygotic twins (24% to 58%) is higher than the rate in dizygotic twins (2% to 5%), and also, the disease heritability is high (>66%) [456].
A number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of SLE, such as HLA, PTPN22, STAT4, IRF5, TNFAIP3, BLK, and BANK1, in various ethnic groups, but most of the GWASs have been performed in Caucasians [178910111213]. In Korea, most of the previously reported SNPs were validated by GWASs, and potentially East Asian-specific SNPs, such as the SNPs in ETS1, IKZF1, and SLC15A4, were also identified [141516]. Recently, Bentham et al. [12] performed a large-scale GWAS with 7,219 cases and 15,991 controls in Europeans and defined 43 SLE loci, including 10 new loci.
Among the SLE-associated loci in Bentham et al. [12], some of them have not been replicated in the Korean population, and others were replicated but not concluded to be associated due to a limited sample size. In this study, we aimed to replicate five SNPs that were not replicated or concluded to be association in Koreans.
