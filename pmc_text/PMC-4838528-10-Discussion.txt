Recently, genomewide omics data have accumulated very fast due to advances in omics technologies (e.g., Illumina's Infinium methylation assay and next-generation sequencing). Now, researchers can exploit public data repositories (e.g., ArrayExpress [3] and GEO [2]) that store data of hundreds of thousands of samples with both genomewide profiling data and associated clinical information. However, as we have shown here, datasets are not error-free, and any type of error can occur in public datasets. Indeed, one paper reported that the aggregate mislabeled blood sample rate was 1.12% at various US institutions in 2013 [19]. Possibly, various kinds of errors (e.g., mislabeling of tubes, mixing of samples) may occur from sample preparation to various steps of the experimental procedures.
When we began the analysis of Infinium 450K Human-Methylation array data, we did not expect errors in gender description to occur so often in several datasets. We thus analyzed if those erroneous samples showed the methylation patterns of gender-specific chromosome abnormality syndromes (e.g., Turner and Klinefelter syndromes) but found that most of the erroneous samples did not. Thus, we concluded that most discordant samples were real human errors. This finding led us to analyze expression datasets of Affymetrix U133Plus2 array data, as well, and again, we found that errors were not rare as well. Fortunately, for transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets, gender-specific markers (Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 4) are well known, so that researchers can check whether the given gender information is concordant with the expected patterns of gender-specific markers. For DNA methylation, a user-friendly website (https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/) [18] is also available for researchers.
In conclusion, we suggest that users of public data should not expect that the data are error-free, and whenever possible, they should check them carefully before use.
