GWAS in Landrace and Yorkshire pigs
The GWAS was performed and the p-values were FDR-corrected. Fig. 1 shows the Manhattan plot across chromosomes. In our analysis, SNPs on chromosome 1 were frequent and the SCAI, AFG1L, and RIMS1 genes on chromosome 1, SPDEF on chromosome 7 were the most significant genes after FDR correction. The SCAI gene is a suppressor of cancer cell invasion. AFG1L is an ATPase family gene 1 homolog. RIMS1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of genes and a synaptic protein that regulates synaptic vesicle exocytosis. SPDEF encodes SAM pointed domain-containing ETS transcription factor. The boxplots of the sex and parity covariates in our model are shown (Figs. 2, 3). The figures show that females had greater BF than males. Table 2 shows the significant SNPs and those containing genes using an FDR cutoff p-value of 0.01. Most of the significant SNPs had a positive beta effect. Fig. 4 represents the quantile-quantile plot (QQ-plot) of GWAS p-values and it shows the normality of our results. Fig. 5 illustrates the principal component analysis in Landrace and Yorkshire breeds to check the population stratification problem between Landrace and Yorkshire samples. It shows separation between Landrace and Yorkshire pigs in PC1 (Principal Component 1).
