Genetic and epigenetic regulation of alternative splicing. (A) Most genes are spliced by typical splice sites (GT-AG) and regulatory sequences in exons (ESS and ESE) and introns (ISS and ISE). Mutations (*) generate alternative splicing, resulting in various transcripts from a single gene. (B) H3K36me3 marking in exons is found in weakly expressed alternatively spliced exons (grey thin dotted line), and H3K4me3 marks are rich in spliced exons (black thick dotted line), indicating that histone modification has a relation to transcription via splicing-related marking mechanisms. Additionally, hisone acethylation could modulate splicing rates to react quickly to changing conditions with increased RNA polymerase II processivity, and spliceosome rearrangements are affected by histone acetylation. High levels of CG have a tendency not to be spliced (grey line in intron), and exon skipping is in the lower level of both CG and mCG in exonic regions. Methylation of exon inhibits binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), leading to exon skipping. ESE, exonic splicing enhancers; ISE, intronic splicing enhancers; ESS, exonic and intronic splicing silencers; ISS, intronic splicing silencers; SR, arginine-serine-rich; RNP, ribonucleoprotein.
