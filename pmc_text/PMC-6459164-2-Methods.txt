Exploratory analysis of gene expression profiles
Raw RNA-seq data from 98 male COPD and 91 normal samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE57148, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using tophat (v2.0.9) and bowtie2 (v2.1.0.0), along with—segment-length 50—segment-mismatches 1 [11,12]. The expression levels of individual transcripts by fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) were calculated by Cufflinks (v2.21) [13]. A total of 1,420 DEGs previously identified by Kim et al. [10] were used for comparison purposes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed with DEGs, and a three-dimensional plot was drawn in R. p-values in the bar graph were estimated by student’s t test. After 500 repeats with the e1071 library in R, the classification power of certain genes was examined by building a naive Bayes model with 10-times cross-validation. The performance of individual classification models, estimating sensitivity and specificity, was measured by computing area under the curve (AUC) values with the Receiver Operating characteristic Curve in R (ROCR) package.
