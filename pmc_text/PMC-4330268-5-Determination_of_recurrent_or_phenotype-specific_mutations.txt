In the 'Analysis Result' tab, MAP software defines the recurrent mutations in study subjects by frequency. The frequency threshold can be determined arbitrarily by the user in the 'Frequency Filter' function. MAP also defines the phenotype-specific mutations using the mutation metrics and phenotype information. Phenotype-specific mutations that occur more frequently in one of two clinical conditions (e.g., drug-responder vs. non-responder) are determined by chi-square test under the user-defined significance level.
