Reordering of draft genomes
Ordering and orienting contigs in draft genomes facilitates comparative genome analysis. Contig ordering can be predicted by comparison of a reference genome that is expected to have a conserved genome organization [10]. ProgressiveMauve (version 2.3.1) was used for ordering contigs in draft genomes. Mauve contig mover (MCM) offers advantages over methods that rely on matches in limited regions near the ends of contigs [1112]. The E. coli K-12 MG1655 strain (accession No. NC_000913.3) was used as a reference genome.
The MCM optional parameters were used in this study including default seed weight, use seed families: 15 determine Locally Collinear Blocks (LCBs); LCBs, full alignment, iterative refinement, sum-of-pairs LCB scoring, and min LCB weight: 200.
