Genomic DNA amplification and detection of different microbial groups by PCR in drinking water samples. Lane M, DNA ladder; lane 1, amplified Prebiocide DNA product; lane 2, amplified Tank A DNA product; lane 3, amplified control DNA product; lane 4, no DNA input for PCR. The amplified DNA product was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5Ã— TBE buffer at 150 V. The arrowhead shows the amplification of genomic DNA and the presence of corresponding microbial DNA.
