For a long time, many nutritionists have believed, based on metabolomics data, that well-fermented kimchi has numerous anti-biotic activities [2324]. Recently, this has led to a significant increase in kimchi export. Kimchi has gradually gained popularity, even among foreigners, and it has become a globally recognized food. However, the genome, biological pathway, and related disease data are still insufficient to explain the health benefits of kimchi. Therefore, we investigated, in silico, a kimchi network based on public information using network-based systems biology tools, including BioXM and Pathway Studio. The in silico network data used in our study were based on published literature. With a long-term aim to search for the metabolic pathways affected by kimchi and kimchi's effects on various diseases, we first re-analyzed the data for better comparability. Then, a number of specific biomolecular networks for kimchi were built in various ways. Genes analyzed in Pathway Studio were shown to be key players in various cellular pathways and mechanisms, such as inflammation, cell proliferation, and immunity, which could be altered by underlying causes, such as disease Moreover, these biological processes were also related to obesity. This interpretation supports the view that there are common, underlying markers for targeted biological processes. Our results should be considered only the initial effort in understanding the interrelated characteristics of the highly complex metabolic pathway of kimchi. Experimental studies will also be needed to verify this in silico kimchi network.
