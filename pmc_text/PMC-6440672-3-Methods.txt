Pre-processing
HGSC patient data collected from the GDC portal can be separated into two categories. Since RNA-seq data from the GDC portal consist of raw count data, normalization was required to control for the sample bias and gene length bias. Two common normalization methods were applied. The first method is called relative long expression (RLE) normalization, implemented in the R package “Deseq2” [8], which is also implemented in the R package “edgeR” [9]. The RLE method utilizes the geometric mean of the read count, whereas the TMM method estimates normalizing factors after extreme expressions are removed to get more a robust estimation. A simple simulation study for DEGs has been performed for comparison [10]. Both methods were used to give more specific comparison results in the model building.
Since the clinical data had many missing values, we imputed missing clinical variables with the R package “mice,” which performs chained equations to find estimates for missing values using Gipps sampling [11]. There were no tendencies in the missing values; so, the missing-at-random assumption was applied [11]. After imputation, significant clinical variables were chosen using a Cox regression model via stepwise selection methods.
Clinical data and RNA-Seq data were integrated and divided into training and test sets. To avoid unwanted effects of censoring, balanced sampling in terms of censoring status was used to make the training and test sets have the same censoring rate.
