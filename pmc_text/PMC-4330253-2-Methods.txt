Study subjects
The study subjects were originally derived from a part of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) project, which was the national project to establish genome epidemiology cohorts of Korean dwellers or immigrants/emigrants [12]. Among the KoGES cohorts, the Korean Association Resource Consortium (KARE) has established a public GWAS dataset by using the Ansan-Anseong cohort, which is an ongoing biennially followed-up cohort in the KoGES [13]. The KARE dataset consists of the individual SNP chip genotypes and the epidemiological/clinical phenotypes for studying the genetic components of Korean public health. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants at the KoGES, and this research project was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Korea National Institute of Health (KNIH). The obtained KARE dataset passed the quality control criteria and was reported in previous GWAS reports [8, 13]. Briefly, the subjects with genotype accuracies below 98% and high missing genotype call rates (â‰¥5%), high heterozygosity (>30%), or inconsistency in sex were excluded from subsequent analysis. Individuals who had a tumor were excluded, as were related individuals whose estimated identity-by-state values were high (>0.80). Based on these criteria, 8,842 samples were selected; these quality control steps have been described in a previous GWAS [13].
