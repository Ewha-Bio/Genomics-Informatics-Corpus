The KARE study population included GWA genotypes from 8,842 individuals [19]. We removed 257 individuals currently taking medication to remove any potential influence on BMD. BMD was measured by speed of sound (SOS) at the distal radius (BMD-RT) and midshaft tibia (BMD-TT), but the value was transformed to T-score for analysis. The mean T-score of the radius and tibia of the 8,586 subjects was 0.038 ± 0.016 (SEM) and -0.472 ± 0.017, respectively.
The meta-analysis of 17 GWASs identified 64 SNPs in 56 loci associated with BMD with genomewide significance. The analysis also proposed a model of BMD-decreasing alleles, and their effects were validated with an independent population: a prospective study in postmenopausal Danish women aged 55-86 years. The alleles were scored with weights based on their individual effects on BMD. Even though the previous GWAS was based on lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD, we assumed that the effects of BMD loci would be available to BMD at other sites, such as the distal radius and midshaft tibia. Thus, the model was applied to the KARE population to prove its validity.
Among 64 SNPs, 9 SNPs were genotyped in the chip, but 55 other SNPs were imputed from genotypes in the 1000 Genomes (1KG) Project (Phase I). After filtering, 60 SNPs were used for the analysis, and individuals were scored according to the scoring system of the previous study. Then, individuals were grouped into five bins based on their scores, and the mean of BMD of each group was measured (Fig. 1). While BMD-RT did not follow the model proposed in the previous study, BMD-TT showed the pattern as expected. In other words, BMD at the midshaft tibia decreased as the score increased. The analysis on the basis of 60 SNPs explained 3.2% of the total genetic variance in BMD-TT.
In order to identify variants significantly influential in the Korean population, an association analysis of 60 SNPs was done with KARE data. Single-marker tests of association with BMD were carried out by trend test (1 d.f.) after adjustments for age, sex, and recruitment area (Table 1). Twelve SNPs showed a directionally consistent association with the previous GWAS (p < 0.05). Six loci were associated with BMD-RT and six loci were associated with BMD-TT, but there were no loci associated with both. One of these loci is on the X chromosome. The same analysis was carried out by gender strarification (Table 2). Three loci were prioritized in the female sample set, and one of them (rs13204965) was newly found in the analysis. Therefore, a total of 13 independent SNPs were selected for further analysis (Fig. 2).
As mentioned in the previous GWAS, some of these 13 SNPs were seen as members of biological pathways related to BMD: the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (TNFRSF11B), mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (SP7), and Wnt signaling (WNT4). Interestingly, SNPs in TNFRSF11B and SP7 were associated with BMD-RT, whereas the SNP in WNT4 was associated with BMD-TT (Tables 1 and 2).
For the purpose of identifying putative functional SNPs, markers in the surrounding 100-Kb region were examined using LD (Table 3). Likewise, they were imputed from 1KG Phase I, centered on 13 loci. Eight BMD-associated SNPs were highly correlated (r2 > 0.8) with functional SNPs annotated in the 1KG reference. rs13245690 was related to 5 putative functional variants, which correlated with each other by LD (r2 > 0.8). Two SNPs (rs1524498 and rs41281692) were located within coding regions in CPED1. rs1524498 leads to synonymous coding, but rs41281692 leads to a conservative change of an amino acid. The remaining 3 SNPs (rs10228519, rs10274486, and rs1357756) were located in the intronic regions in CPED1 and are predicted to alter alleles in transcription factor binding sites. Each allele was anticipated to affect the binding of CUTL1, POU2F1, and GATA-1, respectively.
rs2016266 in SP7 was correlated with two SNPs (rs1318648 and rs17125266) in ESPL1. Both were associated with missense mutations. rs17125266 was predicted to be conservative, but rs1318648 was predicted to be deleterious. rs2062377 was related to a conservative missense variant in TNFRSF11B. On the contrary, rs12821008 was related to the sense variant. Two other SNPs were associated with the 3' untranslated region: rs1346004 in GALNT3 and rs163879 in DCDC5 probably affect splicing regulation. In addition, rs7932354 was predicted to be related to a splice site variant in F2.
