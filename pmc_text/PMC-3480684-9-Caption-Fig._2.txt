Combined effects of risk alleles on triglyceride (TG). Allelic dosage scores are plotted on the X axis. The histogram (Y axis on left, grey bars) represents the percentage of individuals in each risk allele category. The histogram (Y axis on right, black bars) represents mean TG concentrations. (A) Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including the risk allele (rs10503669 at LPL). (B) Four SNPs without the risk allele (rs10503669 at LPL).
