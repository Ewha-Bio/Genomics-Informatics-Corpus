MAP software was designed as a standalone program, compatible in Microsoft Windows environments with a user-friendly graphic interface, and compiled codes of MAP can be easily installed. Both Variant Call Format [13] and its annotation files, such as ANNOVAR output [14], can be used as input files for MAP. When a user loads the input file, called Sample Descriptor file (GSF), MAP software displays the sample set information and filter options (Fig. 1). Once data are loaded, the user can filter the data using the 'Analysis Options' tab in MAP software based on annotation information. By using the sample set and analysis options, MAP software generates the summary metrics for multiple samples. Summary metrics include the mutation status for each sample, total mutation frequency, p-values for differences between phenotype groups based on clinical information, genomic position, reference/observed sequence, and additional information, such as read depth by default. MAP software also displays more detailed information in summary metrics based on the user-selected 'Analysis Options.' In the 'Analysis Result' tab, MAP software provides the frequency- or p-value-based filter function. This functionality supports detection of the recurrent mutations in study subjects and identification of the phenotype-specific mutation that occurs significantly in a certain phenotypic subclass. Then, MAP software represents the user-selected mutations graphically in the 'Visualization' tab. To sort the variants by genomic position, p-value, or frequency, users can use the sort function in the 'Analysis Result' tab. Details of the program download, installation, and analysis procedures are available in the user manual.
The major steps of MAP are as follows.
- Generating mutation summary metrics in study subjects
- Determination of recurrent mutations by frequency
- Determination of phenotype-specific mutations by association test
- Graphical illustration of user-selected mutations
