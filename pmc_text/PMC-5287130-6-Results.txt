Correlation between gene compositional features and expression level
The correlation analyses showed that the gene compositional features are associated with the expression levels of desired genes. The results indicated that the expression levels have significant correlation with the frequencies of some codons such as AAG (in 20 tissues), AUC (in 17 tissues), and GAC (in 12 tissues) (Supplementary Table 2). Among these codons, AAG and AUC showed the most significant correlation coefficients. In order to identify the tissues in which both AAG and AUC have significant correlations with the gene expression level, a bar plot was drawn by R software for these codons (Fig. 1). In Supplementary Table 2, we can see that the most frequent and attributed tRNAs are attributed to the AAG-Lys, AUC-Ile and GAC-Asn codons.
Furthermore, our data showed that the expression levels of apoptosis genes have significant correlations with the relative synonymous codon usage features such as CCC (Prolin) and TCC (Serine) (Supplementary Table 3). Since the aforementioned codons have the most significant correlation coefficients, a bar plot was drawn by R software for these features in order to identify the tissues in which both codons have significant correlation coefficients with gene expression (Fig. 2).
To find the level of codon bias, CAI for each gene was measured. We found some correlations between these parameters and the expression level of desired genes in 8 tissues (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we calculated the tAI, which is a measure of the tRNA usage by coding sequences. Significant correlations between tAI and the expression level of genes were reported in 20 tissues (Supplementary Table 4). Also, the results indicated that nucleotide compositional features (including CG percent in codon bases) have significant correlations with gene expression levels in some tissues (Supplementary Table 4).
