Data analysis
The sequenced reads were aligned to human reference genome 19 using Burrows Wheelers Aligner [10], and duplicate reads were removed using Picard (Broad Institute). Then, the remaining reads were calibrated and realigned using the Genome Analysis Toolkit [11]. The realigned Binary Alignment Map files were analyzed using Strelka [12] to detect somatic single-nucleotide variants and insertions/ deletions. For all programs, the default parameter settings were applied.
