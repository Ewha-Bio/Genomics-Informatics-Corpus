Genotyping and quality control
Genotyping was performed at a multiplex level using the Illumina Golden Gate genotyping system [32]. The genotype quality score for retaining data was set to 0.1. SNPs that could not satisfy the following criteria were excluded: 1) a minimum call rate of 90%, 2) no duplication error, and 3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium greater than p > 0.001. All 20 SNPs were successfully genotyped.
