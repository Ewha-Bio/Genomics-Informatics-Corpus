Statistical analysis
Logistic regression analysis was performed using R package version 3.0.2 to find significant association signals between CNV loci and OF risk. Age, height, and weight were adjusted as covariates to calibrate the statistical significance. Genotypes of each CNV were coded as 0 (homozygous deletion) and 1 (heterozygous deletion) for two-class CNV loci. In the case of three-class CNVs, their genotypes were coded as 0 (homozygous deletion), 1 (heterozygous deletion), and 2 (normal).
