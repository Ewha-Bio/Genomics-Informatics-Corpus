Identifying conserved signatures
CDT-producing isolates were set as the target group, and all other strains were used as the background group by using the in-group setting tab in Gegenees software. Because of the genomic diversity in CDT-producer E. coli, we repeated this procedure with five different strains, including E. coli 53638, E. coli IHE3034, E. coli RN587/1, E. coli STEC B2F1, and E. coli STEC C165-02, which were defined as separate reference strains.
The biomarker score (max/average) setting was also used. Biomarker scores were drawn graphically and loaded into the tabular view for further data analysis. In the tabular view, a score of 1.0 is the maximum biomarker score and is considered as a signature.
