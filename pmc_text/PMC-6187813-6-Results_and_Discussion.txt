Mutation patterns identified from CRPC compared with PC
The average number of somatic mutations per patients was 7,927 in CRPC tissues compared with primary PC tissues (range, 1691 to 21,705). In particular, patient P2 had hypermutations (n = 21,705), whereas patient P1 had a low mutation frequency (n = 1,691) (Fig. 1A). To observe the mutation signatures in the development of CRPC from primary PC, we examined the spectrum of base substitutions. This analysis revealed an unusually high proportion of C:G > T:A and A:T>G:C transversions (Fig. 1B), similar to a previous study [15]. Next, the mutated sites were annotated as non-synonymous, synonymous, stop, and gain mutations. The number of mutations affecting protein-coding genes was 9, 321, 22, and 10 for the four patients (Table 2), and we observed recurrent mutations in the ANKRD20A4, ANDRK38B, AQP7, GGT1, and TAS2R31 genes. Detailed information for the non-synonymous and recurrent mutations is summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Further study will be needed to examine whether the mutated genes are associated with the development of CRPC from primary PC.
In conclusion, PC is a heterogeneous disease and has various steps in its disease progression, including CRPC, the poorest prognostic status during the progression of PC. Understanding the molecular characteristics of the development of CRPC will help identify high-risk PC patients and develop novel therapeutic strategies to block the progression of CRPC. We generated a set of WGS data, consisting of eight PC samples containing four pairs of primary PC and CRPC samples from the same patient, because genetic mutations have the greatest potential to play a role in the progression of PC and CRPC and the therapeutic management of CRPC [16, 17]. By comparing primary PC and its paired CRPC, many somatic mutations that were significantly associated with the development of CRPC were identified, including TP53 and KMT2C, which are known to be involved in the progression of PC [16, 17]. We hope that our whole-genome sequence data of the four paired PC and CRPC tissues will be utilized by many researchers to understand the progression of PC and the resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.
