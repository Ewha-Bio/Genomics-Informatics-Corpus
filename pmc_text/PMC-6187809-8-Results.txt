Comparison of genetic alteration profiles between primary and PDX tumors
Next, we examined how consistent the somatic mutations identified in the primary CRC tissues and corresponding tumor tissues from the PDX mouse models were. Of the 17 somatic mutations, 14 were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors (Fig. 2A). However, 3 mutations that were identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue (Fig. 2A). Overall, variant allele frequencies (VAFs) in the xenografts were higher than in the primary CRCs (Fig. 2B). There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In the CCA-1 case, five mutations (ALK, APC, FBWX7, RB1, and TP53) that were identified in the primary tumor were consistently detected in the xenograft tumor. The average VAF in the primary tumor and xenograft was 36.2% ± 15.7% and 58.6% ± 29.6%, respectively. In the CCA-2 case, two mutations (APC and BRAF) in the primary tumor were consistently detected in the xenograft tumor. In this case, two independent mutations were detected in the APC gene (Table 1), and both of them were consistently detected in the primary and xenograft tumors. The average VAF (%) in the primary tumor and xenograft was 25.7% ± 0.8% and 45.8% ± 1.6%, respectively. In the CCA-3 case, nine mutations were identified in the primary tumor, and six of them (BRAF, CDKN2A, GNA11, RAF1, SF3B1, and TP53) were consistently detected in the corresponding xenograft tissue; however, the other three mutations (CDH1, ERBB2, and ESR1) were not detected in the xenograft. The read depths in the three genes in the PDX tissue were 1,694×, 519×, and 613×, respectively, which is similar to the average read depth. This result suggests that the inconsistency of the three mutations between primary tumors and PDX models night not be due to the relatively shallow read. To further verify whether the inconsistent result was a real difference or due to technical errors, we performed Sanger sequencing for the three genes and confirmed that the mutations of the three genes existed only in the primary tumor (Supplementary Fig. 2).
We also examined how consistent the CNAs that were identified in the primary CRC tissues and the corresponding tumor tissues from the PDX mouse models were. The CNA profiles in the primary tumors were largely consistent with those in the xenograft tumors (Table 2). Fig. 3 illustrates an example of CNA profiles that were identified in primary and xenograft tumors (CCA-1), harboring amplifications of RAF1 (chromosome 3p), FGFR1 (chromosome 8p), and MYC (chromosome 8q). The CNA profiles of the other two CRCs are available in Supplementary Fig. 3.
