GWAS
Gene ID annotation requires a tab-separated GWAS result file comprising marker ID, chromosome ID, base position, and p-value columns in order, and a GTF file that contains strand and position information of genes. It returns a new GWAS result file in which gene, upstream, and downstream columns are added. Both GWAS result files, before and after this annotation, can be visualized in Manhattan and quantile-quantile plot with customizable options (Fig. 2D). One can see all information for a specific dot of oneâ€™s interest if he clicks on the interactive plots. The LD analysis part is read in a VCF file with several detailed options to generate an LD matrix and a marker information file, which can be visualized in the LD heatmap (Fig. 2E and 2F).
