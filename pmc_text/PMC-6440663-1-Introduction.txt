Biliary tract cancer (BTC) is a heterogeneous group of cancers, including gallbladder cancer and extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. BTC has been known as a disease with a poor prognosis, with few treatment options, regardless of its low incidence. In Korea, in 2014, the crude incidence rate of BTC was 11.2 per 100,000 men, and the crude mortality rate was 7.7 per 100,000 in both men and women [1]. Most patients have been diagnosed at an advanced stage. Although surgical resection is a curative treatment, recurrence of disease has been a clinical issue for patients after surgery [2]. Combination treatment with cisplatin plus gemcitabine has been reported as an appropriate treatment for patients with advanced BTC [3].
The genomic characteristics of BTC have been revealed through several studies using high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies [4â€“6]. Jiao et al. [5] reported exome sequencing results of 32 patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Inactivating mutations in chromatin remodeling genes, including BAP1, ARID1A, and PBRM1, were identified with frequent mutations in IDH1 and IDH2. The oncogenes KRAS, PIK3CA, NRAS, GNAS, and ERBB2 were also significantly mutated in BTC [6]. Genomic analyses need to be performed in more BTCs to understand their biology and develop therapeutic strategies.
Here, we reported the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of seven patients with BTC and analyzed their somatic mutations to compare the genetic features between patients.
