Double-ligand studies: non-additive responses
To understand how the presence of one or more ligands modified the transcriptional responses to the other ligands, we evaluated features that exhibited non-additive responses during the double-ligand studies and grouped them into three categories: significant responses 1) to both ligands; 2) to either ligand A or ligand B; 3) to neither ligand (Table 1). A total of 433 features showed non-additive responses above threshold levels in at least one of the double-ligand studies.
In all of the double-ligand studies involving KDO, we found differences in gene transcription that were not present when the ligands were applied individually. Applying KDO together with IFN-β augmented IFN-β-mediated transcriptional responses. In contrast, when KDO was combined with 8-Br, each ligand abrogated the single-ligand response of the other.
