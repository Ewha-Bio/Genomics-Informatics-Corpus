Chromothripsis-like pattern by NGS-based copy number variation analysis in MM patient samples
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are widely used for the analysis of CNAs, including chromothripsis-like patterns. However, the minimum amount of DNA required for SNP array analysis is considerably high. Thus, NGS-based copy number variation (CNV) analysis, which requires a relatively small quantity of DNA, was adopted in the study.
To determine the changes in CNAs for drug response, NGS-based CNV analysis of pre- and post-treatment specimens from 4 patients with BTZ treated was performed. The patients were also divided into sensitive (stringent complete remission, CR, near complete remission, very good partial response, and partial response) and resistant (stable disease and progressive disease) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria (Table 4). Patients in each of the two groups showed changes in CNAs before and after treatment. After treatment, the frequency of CNAs decreased in the sensitive group, whereas it increased in the resistant group compared to pre-treatment (Fig. 3A and 3B).
No chromothripsis-like pattern was observed in four patients. However, it was shown that the the number of breakpoint was high in chr 4q of pt 4. In the comparison of chromosome by arms, breakpoints were more frequent in the q arm, as in the previous results (p: 36 breakpoints, q: 82 breakpoints).
The association of MM-related genes in the 1q21 region on chr 1, in which the chromothripsis-like pattern was frequently observed, was shown again, as in the previous result. There are 29 genes that are associated with MM among the total 218 genes that coded for proteins in the locus, and it was known that the prognosis is poor when all of these genes are amplified [32-39]. Then, the candidate genes in chr 1 were further analyzed for chromothripsis-like patterns (Fig. 3C).
