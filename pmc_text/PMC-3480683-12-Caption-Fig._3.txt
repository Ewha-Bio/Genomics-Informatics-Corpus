Effect of the interaction of haplotype 3 in block 2 (TGTGTAGAGCTCCTCG) with daily energy intake on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) level (p = 5.6 × 10-3). Subjects were divided into daily energy intake ≤ 1,500 kcal (HT3/HT3 or HT3/-, 387; -/-, 1,353), 1,501-2,000 kcal (HT3/HT3 or HT3/-, 646; -/-, 2,297), 2001-2,500 kcal (HT3/HT3 or HT3/-, 358; -/-, 1,216), and ≥ 2,501 kcal (HT3/HT3 or HT3/-, 235; -/-, 801). Interaction p-values were calculated by linear regression analyses, which includes main and interaction effects, adjusted for residence area, age, gender, and body mass index. HT, haplotype.
