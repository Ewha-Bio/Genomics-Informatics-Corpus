CTCF
Chromatin organizer roles of CTCF
CTCF is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that functions by utilizing an 11-zinc-finger domain [29]. Because CTCF was first identified at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the chicken β-globin locus [30] and the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus [31, 32], it is known as an insulator protein that can block enhancer activity in eukaryotes [32]. Although insulators would be expected to be located in intergenic regions where they could act as barriers to block enhancer activity [30], genome-wide analysis indicated that CTCF-binding sites are present in genes and/or promoter regions as well as intergenic regions [10, 33]. More recent evidence revealed that almost 15% of CTCF-recognition sites are located near promoters and ~40% are within exons and introns [17], suggesting that CTCF has dynamic roles other than enhancer blocking activity.
While earlier studies implied that the distribution patterns of CTCF are similar to those of transcription activators or repressors, recently determined global distribution patterns suggested that CTCF-binding sites are not strongly correlated with general transcription factor occupancy [10]. Moreover, depletion of CTCF altered its histone acetylation and methylation profiles in the β-globin locus, but did not significantly affect β-globin expression [34, 35], suggesting that CTCF has a role distinct from that of traditional regulatory proteins.
Interestingly, CTCF has been shown to serve as a chromatin organizer complex by linking chromosomal domains in the mouse/human β-globin cluster (Fig. 2) [36, 37]. During erythroid differentiation, CTCF is recruited and enables enhancers to physically access promoters of β-globin, which both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function [36, 37]. Similarly, long-range interactions associated with CTCF have been observed within mammalian gene loci including the Igf2/H19 imprinted control region [38, 39], the α-globin gene cluster in erythroid cells [40], and the Igh locus in B cells [41].
DNA methylation and CTCF binding
It has been known for many years that CTCF binding is abolished by the DNA methylation of CpG sites within the CTCF motif [32]. At the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus, CTCF binds specifically to the unmethylated differentially methylated region (DMR), which is required for the expression of H19 on the maternal chromosome (Fig. 3A) [32, 42]. However, on the paternal allele, the methylated DMR prohibits CTCF enrichment and leads to IGF2 expression [30, 42], suggesting methylation-sensitive binding of CTCF at the target region. Interestingly, genome-wide association studies have identified that only a small subset of CTCF-binding sites are sensitive to the methylation status of DNA [8, 43].
Abnormal DNA methylation patterns of CTCF-binding sites are associated with transcriptional regulation of tumor suppressor or oncogenic genes in several human cancers [44]. CTCF plays an essential role in maintaining INK/ARF gene expression and disruption of its binding by DNA methylation contributes to the epigenetic silencing of INK/ARF genes in human breast cancer cells [45, 46]. Epigenetic inactivation of RASSF1A and CDH1 also correlates with the epigenetic alteration of CTCF-recognition sites in human breast cancer [46]. Conversely, in one study, aberrant DNA methylation led to the prevention of CTCF-mediated silencing of the BCL6 gene, thus increasing oncogenic BCL6 expression in lymphoma [47].
The concept that the methylation-sensitive binding of CTCF controls gene expression by changing the chromatin architecture has been supported by the finding that CTCF alters the chromatin architecture [8]. For instance, in the Igf2/H19 locus, Igf2 imprinting on the maternal allele is performed by perturbing the proper long-range chromatin interactions between the Igf2 gene and a distal enhancer through the formation of chromatin loops mediated by CTCF (Fig. 3A) [38, 39]. However, on the paternal chromosome, CTCF enrichment at the DMR and insulator looping are prevented by DNA methylation, thus ensuring physical interaction between the Igf2 gene and the distal enhancer and inducing the exclusive expression of the paternal allele. Similarly, nucleotide excision repair factor-mediated DNA demethylation at the promoter region induces the enrichment of CTCF and consequently the formation of a looping structure and controls gene expression at the RARβ2 locus [48]. We also found that epigenetic silencing of PTGS2 correlates with the loss of CTCF binding by DNA methylation at the promoter region, thereby producing an inappropriate higher-order chromatin structure in human gastric cancer cells (Fig. 3B) [49].
Somatic mutations at CTCF-binding sites
In several studies, somatic mutations at the coding region of the CTCF gene were detected in acute leukemia and individuals with intellectual disability [50–52]. However, a high frequency of recurrent mutations in the CTCF-binding site has been more profoundly found in human cancer [53]. Unsurprisingly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms also confer disease susceptibility in humans by decreasing the methylation level at differentially methylated CTCF-binding sites such as rs2334499 in the 11p15 region [54]. Since genetic and/or epigenetic alterations frequently occur in the CTCF anchor region in various human cancers [7, 8, 55], these mutations can influence gene expression and tumor progression by abrogating the CTCF-mediated spatial folding of chromosomes [56].
Architectural role of CTCF
There is direct evidence that CTCF can physically interact with other transcriptional regulators, such as the zinc finger protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1), as an X chromosome binary switch [57]. CTCF also forms a complex with the SNF2-like chromodomain helicase protein (CHD8) [58] and the methyl-CpG–binding protein Kaiso [59] through the zinc-finger domain [10]. Thus, CHD8 enhances insulator activity, whereas Kaiso has a negative effect on the CTCF-mediated enhancer blocking activity [58, 59].
Interestingly, the C-terminus of CTCF preferentially interacts with the STAG1 or STAG2 subunit of cohesin [60]. Furthermore, recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF revealed that CTCF often colocalizes with the cohesin complex throughout the genome [61–63]. Thus, CTCF is generally thought to be required for the localization of cohesin at its binding sites [64].
