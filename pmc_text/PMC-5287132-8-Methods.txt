Unique pathway identification
After this, unique metabolic pathways of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC25586 were identified through the comparison of metabolic pathways of both Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC25586 and Homo sapiens by using KEGG Genome Database [25]. Among unique metabolic pathways of only those proteins were identified which were human non-homologue essential proteins.
