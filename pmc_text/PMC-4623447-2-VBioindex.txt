VBioindex supports four statistical indices-the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and the relative dominance of species-that are widely used as important criteria to evaluate ecosystems.
The Shannon-Wiener index (H') was designed to predict the next letter of communication in a random set of data and to quantify entropy in terms of uncertainty or information content [10]. It has been widely applied in a variety of fields, such as biology and ecology. H' is measured using entropy with the proportion of individuals (n) for total emerged species (s) [10]. pi=ni∑i=1sni H′=-∑i=1spilogpi
Species richness (DMg), known as Margalef's richness index, is a measure of the variety of species in a given area or sample [10], which is calculated based on emerged species (s), and the individuals (n) of total emerged species [14]. DMg=s-1log∑i=1sni
Species evenness (E) is the degree of the distribution of individual organisms among species [15], which is measured using H' and the log of emerged species (s) [16]. E=H′logs
Relative dominance (RD) is the frequency of individuals of a species, which generally presents the degree of dominance for a species as a percentage [17]. RDi=ni∑i=1sni×100
VBioindex is implemented by clicking a few buttons, such as Open, Save, and some selectable radio buttons (Fig. 1A). An input data file is accepted as a tab-delimited file, labeled with the date, species name, and number of individuals (Fig. 1B). The results of the four methods are graphically represented charts with a tab-delimited text output file (Fig. 1C). Along with presenting these biodiversity indices, VBioindex allows time-series analyses at a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis for all statistical methods, the functions of which are useful in analyzing long-term species diversity. VBioindex is programmed in Java language (higher than version 1.7), and it can be used in all operating systems in which a Java Virtual Machine has been installed.
