Semantic modeling
To look for diverse interactions of ethnicity-specific SNPs, we constructed a semantic model using BioXM [7], which efficiently manages knowledge, such as complex scientific research data. The model provides semantic networks with useful relationship information between participating entities. Our semantic model consists of seven entities, including "Gene [14]," "Pathway [14]," "Disease [14]," "Chemical [14]," "Drug [15]," "SNP [12]," and "ClinicalTrials (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)", and 10 relations, including "Pathway-Gene," "Disease-Pathway," "Disease-Chemical," "Gene-Disease," "Gene-Chemical," "SNP-Gene," "Chemical-Pathway," "Chemical-Drug," "ClinicalTrials-Disease," and "Drug-ClinicalTrials." Conversion of all data to entity input format was parsed using Python.
