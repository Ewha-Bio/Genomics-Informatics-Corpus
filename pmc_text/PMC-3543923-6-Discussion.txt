Individual variation in gene expression levels may be influenced by environmental and genetic factors. A substantial proportion of the variation is heritable and thus has a genetic basis. Based on studies on population-level genotype-expression data, it is now well established that DNA variations affect the expression levels of nearby or remote genes. Since the genotype data used in these studies were mostly measured on commercial SNP chip platforms of common variants, the causal eQTLs must be probed SNPs or located within the linkage disequilibrium blocks tagged by the probed SNPs. Whatever the case is, one may wonder whether those eQTLs evolved neutrally without any selection pressure or whether they were the result of selection over human population history. The co-expression network study by Nayak et al. [28] indicated that the subnetworks are modular and coherent in biological functions. It is very unlikely that such network structures were derived as the result of random drift in genomic variations. It is also interesting that evolutionary selection operated on a network or pathway level. Although they must have occurred gene by gene, the whole sum of the variations has biological themes. If the activity of the pathways is variable between normal individuals, it has an implication in predicting disease susceptibility. As the subjects probed by gene expression profiling are normal individuals, the variations of the pathway activity may not be large enough to trigger diseases. Nevertheless, they may predispose the genetic background of an individual to be susceptible or resistant to certain diseases. For example, individuals having slightly diminished immune pathway activities may have a high tendency of contracting infectious diseases or other immune-related diseases. The next challenge would then be the experimental validation of this hypothesis.
