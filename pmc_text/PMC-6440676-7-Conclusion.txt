Initially, ncRNAs, which do not encode proteins, were referred to as noise or junk DNA. However, interest in ncRNAs increased following the completion of the Human Genome Project. Since then, the study of ncRNAs has gradually become a central research area in RNA biology. As the amount of research on ncRNAs continues to grow, the importance of the non-protein-coding part of the human genome has been highlighted. In addition, with the revealing of several important roles of lncRNAs in vivo, interest in lncRNAs has increased. Research into the roles of lncRNAs has presented a new direction for research into tumorigenic mechanisms and cancer therapies. In general, an increase in lncRNAs expression is observed to be highly correlated to the incidence of cancer. In addition, upregulated lncRNAs contribute to the promotion of many biological processes associated with cancer development such as cell cycle progression as well as cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Despite the findings of many lncRNA-related studies, there are still many obstacles to fully elucidating the functions of lncRNAs. Regardless, future lncRNA studies are expected to reveal and describe the regulatory networks and molecular characteristics of human cancers. Elucidation of the relationships between oncogenic lncRNAs and tumorigenesis may be helpful for in the development of deeper insights into cancer prevention and treatment.
