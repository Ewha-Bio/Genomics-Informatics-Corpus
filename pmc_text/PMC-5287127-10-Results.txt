Association analysis of CNV regions with OF risk
We performed logistic regression analysis to evaluate associations between identified CNV regions and OF risk. As a result, we identified a total of eight CNV loci associated with OF (p < 0.05) (Table 2)â€”distributed on chromosome 4q13.1, 4q13.2, 9q34.2, 13q12.2, 14q24.3, 14q31.3, 20p13, and 20q13.12. The OF-associated loci were located in intergenic regions near SRIP1; TMPRSS11E; POLR1D; LOC-100421611; a family of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), LINC01260; and genic regions of ABO, ELMSAN1, and SIRPA. The base-pair lengths of the eight regions ranged from 1.9 kb to 18.6 kb. The CNVs in ABO and SIRPA included both exonic and intronic regions of each gene, whereas the CNV locus in ELMSAN1 included only intronic regions.
