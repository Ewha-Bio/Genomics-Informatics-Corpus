The whole genomes along with gene annotations were retrieved from NCBI GenBank. All sequences marked as coding sequences were considered, including those annotated as hypothetical and those predicted by computational methods only. In this study, we measured the expression pattern and codon usage of five crenarchaeal genomes namely, Aeropyrumpernix K1 (GenBank accession No. NC_000854), Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456 (GenBank accession No. NC_008818), Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2 (GenBank accession No. NC_003364), Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 (GenBank accession No. NC_002754), and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 (GenBank accession No. NC_003106). In the following sections, we have briefly described the different expression level predictors CAI, RCBS, RCA, GC3, and Impact Codon and developed an alternative approach using the score of MRCBS.
