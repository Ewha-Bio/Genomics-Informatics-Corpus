Based on the in silico approaches employed in this study, the plausible stable homology models of the ER and KR domains of FASN protein are suggested, which are also found to be in substantial agreement with the reported crystal structures. Further, the favorable outcomes of substrate binding with the ER and KR domains validate the predicted structures and their potential for screening anti-FASN ligands. The insights from this in silico study would be very helpful in pharmacologic lead generation, as FASN inhibition is favorably implicated in the treatment of cancers, diabetes, obesity, and infections.
