Hemmer et al. [12] studied DNA copy number changes by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) in 69 primary thyroid carcinomas including 13 ATC patients. From those 11 ATC cases, showed chromosomal changes (10 gains, 3 deletions, both in 2 cases). Regions of frequent gains were mainly located in 7p22-pter, 8q22-qter, and 9q34-qter regions in 31%, 23% and 23% of ATC cases, respectively. The known proto-oncogenes such as PDGR-α, myc and ABL1, and VAVZ are located, in these regions but still no functional evidences were found supporting the association of copy number changes of these regions and the aggressiveness of ATC. Also, Rodrigues et al. [40] examined 39 thyroid cancer patients including 7 ATCs. All cases of ATC presented chromosomal imbalances, especially, they found gains at chromosome 20p and 20q, and losses of Xp in 6 cases of ATC, and gains at 3q and 5p in 5 cases ATC. Some important genes included PI3K, BCL6, and SST at 3q; invasion and metastases genes (MMP9 and MMP24), a cell cycle and mitotic checkpoint gene (STK15) at 20q. The loss of tumor suppressor gene related 7q31 was detected. The chromosomal instability of ATC revealed as significantly higher than well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) or PDTC when compared the CGH-detectable abnormalities as reported by couple of studies [12, 40].
Kitamura et al. [41] detected allelic losses using 21 ATC patient samples in 1q (40%), 9p (58%), 11p (33%), 11q (33%), 17p (44%), 17q (43%), 19p (36%), and 22q (38%). Wreesmann et al. [13] reported the unique gains at chromosome 3p13-14 and 11q13 (where the cyclin D1 and FOSL1 located) and losses at 5q11-31 in ATC patients.
Liu et al. [11] found frequent copy number gains in many receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes containing the EGFR, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, KIT, MET, PIK3Ca, PIK3Cb, and PDK1 genes. Many of the genes with copy number gains are known to be proto-oncogenes so that they may be play a important role in ATC tumorigenesis by increasing the protein level followed by aberrant activation of the oncogenic pathway. The prevalence of copy number gains was generally higher in ATC than differentiated thyroid cancer [42], also as mentioned in other studies. It is supposed that the copy number variations, which could be occurred by chromosomal amplification or instability, should be important and involved to the progression and aggressiveness of ATC [43].
Chromosomal alteration could cause the genomic rearrangements and fusion genes. In PTC, rearrangement causing RET/PTC fusion gene was observed often, but it rarely occur in benign follicular thyroid adenoma and follicular variant PTC [44]. Liu et al. [11] reported the same RET/PTC rearrangement in 3 cases of ATC tissues, but because some ATC tissues contained PTC tissues, they were suspicious to their result. Therefore, if chromosomal rearrangement and fusion genes, including RET/PTC fusion, involve to the ATC progression, should be investigated further.
