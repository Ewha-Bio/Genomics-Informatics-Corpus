The human genome contains actively moving retrotransposons (human endogenous retrovirus [HERV], long interspersed nucleotide element [LINE], and short interspersed nucleotide element [SINE]). Approximately 36% of the human genome has been generated through retrotransposition of LINE and other RNA species by the LINE reverse transcriptase [1, 2]. Retrotransposition is progressing in the human population by L1, Alu, and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) insertions [3]. L1 is an autonomous retrotransposon that contains an internal RNA polymerase II promoter and a reverse transcriptase, whereas Alu and SVA lack activities for independent mobilization [4, 5]. Therefore, Alu and SVA are assumed to use the L1 protein machinery for their own mobilization [3], and retrotransposition events of marked SVA elements occur indeed by L1 elements in human cultured cells [5, 6].
The SVA elements were originally named from the SINE-R retroposon, derived from an endogenous retrovirus, the HERV-K LTR element. SINE-R11, 14, and 19 have been isolated by colony blot hybridization using the LTR element as probe [7]. SINE-R.C2 has been found in the third intron of the C2 gene on the short arm of human chromosome 6, which was a human-specific element [8]. Within the Xq21.3 block, two SINE-R retroposons (HS307 and HS408) were identified [9]. Multiple copy numbers of retroposons have been successively detected in hominoid primates and humans [9-16]. Other similar sequences have been associated with Alu-like sequences within the HLA-RP1 (STK19) gene [17]. These composite retroposons with the entire structure are named SVA (SINE-R, VNTR, and Alu).
The SVA families are evolutionarily young and hominoid-specific retroelements. They have ability to influence a genomic locus in which they reside and cause various human diseases as insertional mutagens. In fact, Fukuyama muscular dystrophy (FCMD) is derived from the polymorphic SVA-E insertion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the FUKUTIN gene [18]. SVA elements could also drive transcription of functional genes. In the 5' upstream region of TBPL2, the SVA element serves as a promoter, while the SVA-D element in the WDR66 gene promotes the transcription of a human-specific transcript variant [19]. Here, we analyzed structure variants of functional genes mediated by SVA subfamilies and examined their expression patterns in various human tissues.
