Repeat-induced DNA replication errors and copy number variation (CNV) formation. The straight lines depict single DNA strands, and the solid arrows (red and blue) represent genomic repeats. The dashed lines indicate newly synthesized DNA strands. During DNA replication, adjacent repeats could form DNA secondary structures (such as hairpin) that consequently result in replication fork stalling. Then, CNVs are generated via DNA template switching. For example, (1) jumping over the secondary structures and restarting DNA replication lead to deletions and (2) switching to a new template (shown in green lines) and switching back result in duplications of the green DNA segment.
