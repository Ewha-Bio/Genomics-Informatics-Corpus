Preparation of genomic DNA and cfDNA for dPCR
Blood was centrifuged at 1,800 ×g for 10 minutes to separate the buffy coat from the plasma. The buffy coat was used to isolate genomic DNA using a Qiagen DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). According to standard protocols, genomic DNA was eluted using 200 µL of elution buffer. Plasma (1 mL) and urine (3 mL) were centrifuged at 11,000 ×g for 3 min, and 1,800 ×g for 10 min, respectively, to remove cells. cfDNA was isolated from plasma and urine using a Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid kit and eluted using 50 µL of elution buffer. DNA was stored at −20℃.
