Targeted deep sequencing
We performed targeted NGS, covering 95 cancer-related genes, for specimens of the three primary CRCs and corresponding PDX tumors. DNA from the blood of the three patients was also sequenced to determine the somatic alterations. The average coverage of the sequencing depth was 958× (range, 834.4 to 1017×) (Supplementary Table 3). Through the filtering steps, we identified 17 non-silent somatic mutations across 13 cancer-related genes (ALK, APC, BRAF, CDH1, CDKN2A, ERBB2, ESR1, FBXW7, GNA11, RAF1, RB1, SF3B1, and TP53) (Table 1). Among them, three mutations (APC, TP53, and FBXW7) overlapped with the TCGA projects and the top 20 colon and rectal adenocarcinoma genes in the COSMIC database (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).
