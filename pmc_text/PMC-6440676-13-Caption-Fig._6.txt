Expression levels of MALAT1 in breast cancers. Datasets obtained from Oncomine demonstrated that invasive ductal breast carcinomas significantly expressed high levels of MALAT1 compared to the normal counterparts. (A) Fold change = 2.600, p = 2.45 × 10−6 [53]. (B) Fold change = 2.166, p = 6.14 × 10−4 [54]. MALAT1, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1.
