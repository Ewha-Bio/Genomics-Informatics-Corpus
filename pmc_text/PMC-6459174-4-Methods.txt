DNA extraction and genotyping
DNA was extracted from buccal swabs using the GeneAll Exgene Clinic SV mini kit (GeneALL, Seoul, Korea). We analyzed a total of 20 mtDNA haplogroups specific to East Asia from previous report (M, D, D4, D4a, D4b, D4b2, D5, M7, M8, M9, M10, M11, G, C4, N9a, Y, A, F, B4, and B5) [28]. For mtDNA haplogroups determination, we used a 20-plex SNaPshot assay [28]. Primer sequences for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and single base extension (SBE) reaction were presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 [28]. The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 μL containing 10 ng DNA of genomic DNA, 0.035–0.180 μM each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1× PCR buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) on a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The cycling conditions were 95℃ for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of amplification at 94℃ for 15 s, 60℃ for 15 s, 72℃ for 30 s, and a final extension at 70℃ for 10 min. PCR products were purified by adding 1 μL ExoSapIT (USB, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Twenty-plex SBE reaction was performed on a C1000 Touch thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) in 6 μL with 1 μL of purified PCR product, 1.75 μL of SBE primer mix (0.04–0.18 μM of each primer), and 1 μL of SNaPshot reaction mix (Applied Biosystems). The cycling conditions: 25 cycles of 96℃ for 10 s, 50℃ for 5 s, and 60℃ for 30 s. The remaining fluorescent ddNTPs were removed by addition of 1 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase to the SBE reaction product and incubation at 37℃ for 45 min followed by 80℃ for 15 min. Samples were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer in which 1 μL of SBE product was mixed with 14 μL of Hi-Di formamide and 0.4 μL of GeneScan 120 LIZ internal size standard. Automated allele calls were made using GeneMapper v.4.0.
