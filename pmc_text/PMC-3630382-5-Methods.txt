Comparison with genotypes from SNP chip
To compare with genotypes from SNP chip, the genotyping was performed using UnifiedGenotyper with the intervals, including all the coordinates of SNP chip and the option-output_mode EMIT_ALL_SITES. For each sample with genotype information from SNP chip, overall genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity, and non-reference discrepancy rate were calculated according to the guide of GATK VariantEval using the genotypes with DP â‰¥ 5.
