Types of defects in mutations
The presence of 1,284 mutations within 1,039 barcodes prompted us to examine the types of barcode defects in detail. As shown in Table 3, substitutions accounted for 702 mutated barcodes (67.6%), versus deletions for 177 (17.0%), insertions for 79 (7.6%), and others for 81 (complex and unclassified, 7.8%). When compared with budding yeast (âˆ¼28%), the overall occurrence of substitution was unexpectedly high (refer to Discussion).
