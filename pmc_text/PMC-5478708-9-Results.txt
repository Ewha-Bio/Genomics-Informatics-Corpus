Celecoxib versus DMSO
The analysis of celecoxib versus DMSO showed that four gene sets were enriched in celecoxib-treated HDFs as compared with DMSO-treated HDFs. These gene sets consist of genes involved in the G2M checkpoint, E2F targets, Î³ tubulin complex and the four way junction (Holliday junction) DNA binding (Table 4, Fig. 3A). Enriched genes in each gene set were shown in Supplementary Tables 7, 8, 9, 10.
On the other hand, one gene set was enriched in DMSO-treated HDFs as compared with celecoxib-treated HDFs. This gene set consists of genes regulating olfactory signaling pathway (Table 5, Fig. 3B). The list of enriched genes in this pathway was shown in Supplementary Table 11.
