Binding pocket prediction
Site Map 2.6 (Schr√∂dinger, LLC) was used to identify the active sites on the predicted models. Various countermaps were also generated to distinguish the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on the active site regions. Finally, the best binding pockets were ranked based on the Sitemap score.
