Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of gastritis-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in females. This shows how well 20 ranked gastritis-associated SNPs (Table 4) classify patients and normal subjects in females. As much as the ROC curve, these factors can classify gastritis patients and normal subjects in females.
