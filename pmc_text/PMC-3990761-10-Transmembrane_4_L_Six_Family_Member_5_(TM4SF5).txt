Other TM4SF5-mediated EMT-related biological processes
The EMT is well known to be related also to the development [84] and stemness of self-renewal [9]. We also observed that TM4SF5 can play roles in other EMT-mediated biological processes, like development of muscles and self-renewal of cancer cells. In zebrafish, suppression of tm4sf5 results in abnormal development, with an aberrant trunk and morphology of muscle fibers, presumably via alterations in the expression and localization of integrin α5, which is necessary for somite boundary maintenance (Choi YJ and Lee JW, in revision). In addition to liver fibrosis and tumorigenesis, therefore, TM4SF5 expression is importantly involved in the development of zebrafish muscles, which might bemediated by EMT.
Presumably, these diverse cellular effects by TM4SF5 expression might be possible due to the characteristics of TM4SF5-similar to tetraspanins-which forms large protein networks via heterophilic or homophilic interactions between tetraspanins, integrins, and growth factor receptors. TM4SF5 is shown to bind integrin α2, β1 [70, 71], α5 [72], EGFR [73], and interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) (Ryu J and Lee JW, in revision). Although its ligand has not been identified, interaction(s) with (an)other membrane protein or receptor can recapitulate the ligand binding-based activation. Therefore, TM4SF5 can transduce signaling activities for diverse cellular functions, including the EMT and different EMT-mediated phenotypes. Although diverse miRs are known to regulate the EMT [7], miRs targeting TM4SF5 are being studied.
