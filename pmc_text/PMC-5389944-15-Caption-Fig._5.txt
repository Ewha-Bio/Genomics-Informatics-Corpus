Procedure for importing integrated relationship data into a graph database. ‘ DataManager.java’ defines the relationship between each raw data to be input and performs preprocessing steps, such as removing duplicates. ‘ Parsers.java’ reads raw data from a text file and stores them in the graph database. ‘ Mapping.java’ classifies nodes and relationships from the parsed raw data. ‘ Filter.java’ removes duplicate or ambiguous nodes and relationships among created nodes and relationships. ‘ BuildManager.java’ structures the filtered nodes and relationships information according to the previously defined graph database model structure. ‘ DataStructure. java’ and ‘ Integrate.java’ build a graph database by allocating nodes and relationships according to the modeled database structure.
