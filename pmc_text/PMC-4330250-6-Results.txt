GWA analysis
The genotype data of 8,842 samples in a total of 10,038 participants in the KARE were analyzed to find significant SNPs associated with BMI in Korean individuals. Among the total of 1,827,004 loci, 435 loci were identified using a p-value cutoff (p < 5 × 10-4) from the GWAS. The default algorithm in the HaploView program for identifying LD blocks was taken from confidence intervals [13]. We set a ±20-kb window option and r2 > 0.9 to capture LD blocks of 435 significant SNPs based on the KARE genotype data. For 435 loci that were significant in the association analysis (p < 5 × 10-4), 53 LD blocks were identified using HaploView (Table 1). These 53 LD blocks contained all 435 significant loci. Thus, a typical LD block included multiple significant loci.
