CTCF/cohesin-mediated abnormal higher-order chromosome structure during tumor development
Dysregulation of the components of the cohesin complex might promote genomic instability by perturbing proper long-range chromatin interactions, which can confer the spatial proximity required for the rejoining of DSBs during chromosomal rearrangement [18]. More recent studies support a similar role for the CTCF/cohesin-mediated chromatin loop as a regulator of genome integrity [84]. They found that chromosome loop anchors bound by CTCF and cohesin are vulnerable to continuous DNA breaks and translocation breakpoint regions in various cancers are enriched at these loop anchors [84]. Similarly, we found that cohesin-mediated chromatin organization and DNA replication are important for stabilizing gene amplification in cancer cells with chromosomal instability (Fig. 5) [85]. Although a high frequency of recurrent mutations and deletions of the components of the cohesin complex was identified in human diseases [70, 71, 86], aberrant overexpression of the cohesin complex [9] was also frequently detected in various human malignancies [85]. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of the cohesin complex in mesenchymal cancer cells induces mesenchymal to epithelial transition–specific expression patterns and dynamic cohesin-mediated chromatin structures are responsible for the initiation and regulation of essential epithelial to mesenchymal transition–related cell fate changes in human cancer (Fig. 6) [87].
An increasing amount of recent evidence has indicated that CTCF and cohesin are enriched at TADs [6, 15]. Accordingly, cohesin-associated CTCF loops occur within TADs and enhancers generally interact with genes within these loops [8]. Interestingly, recurrent mutations occur frequently within CTCF anchor sites adjacent to oncogenes or cancer-associated genes [55]. Mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene promotes susceptibility of the CTCF-binding sites to DNA methylation and the loss of CTCF binding resulting in the disruption of TAD organization in human gliomas [88]. Somatic mutations change oncogene-containing insulated neighborhoods, thereby allowing improper activation of proto-oncogenes by enhancers located within different TADs [89]. Furthermore, disruption of CTCF-mediated TAD formation by human noncoding disease variants elicits pathogenic phenotypes, providing the mechanistic linkage between spatial genomic organization and genetic alterations that influence gene expression [90].
