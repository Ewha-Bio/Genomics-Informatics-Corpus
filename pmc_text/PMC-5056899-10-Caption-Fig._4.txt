Mechanisms of Alu recombination-mediated deletions. (A) Nonhomologous end-joining mediated deletion mechanism. After DNA double strand breaks, non-homologous templates are ligated by Alu element. (B) Nonallelic homologous recombination mechanism, interchromosomal recombination occurs between two different Alu elements which locate on different chromosomes and mediates genomic duplication or deletion. Intrachromosomal recombination occurs between two different Alu elements which locate on the same chromosome and mediates genomic deletion. Green and yellow boxes represent Alu elements. The red dot line indicates homologous sequences.
