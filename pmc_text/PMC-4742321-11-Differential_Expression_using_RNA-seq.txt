For differential expression analysis, a number of software packages and pipelines have been developed including edgeR [39], DESeq [40], NOIseq [23], SAMseq [41], Cuffdiff [24], and EBSeq [42]. Unlike edgeR and DESeq, which adopt negative binomial models, and NOIseq and SAMseq, which are non-parametric, Cuffdiff and EBSeq can be used to compare differentially expressed genes by employing transcript-based detection methods. Many of the programs accept read count data as input, which can be produced by using HTSeq [43] or BEDTools [44]. Similarly to Cuffdiff, Ballgown program [45] is employed for differential expression analysis using read mapping data from StringTie [26] (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/index.shtml?t=manual). The above programs adopt one or more of the several available normalization methods (total count, upper quartile, median, DESeq normalization, trimmed mean of M values, quantile and RPKM normalization) to correct biases that may appear between samples (sequencing depth [33]) or within sample (gene length [46] and GC contents [45]).
Although many programs have been developed, one research group reported that there may be large differences between these programs and that no single method may be optimal under all experimental conditions [48]. Thus, it may be difficult for most of users with no or weak statistical background to select a proper method. However, because RNA-seq data sets are rapidly accumulating, we expect that new bioinformatics tools for differential expression will be developed, which will function robustly under a wide range of conditions.
