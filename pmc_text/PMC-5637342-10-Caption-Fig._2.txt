Error rates in imputing HLA information on 61 HapMap CHB ï¼‹JPT samples. We evaluated error rates using three different reference panels. The error rates were based on 4-digit imputation using SNP2HLA and were averaged over six HLA genes (A, B, C, DRB1, DPB1, and DQB1). The bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. CHB, Beijing, China; JPT, Tokyo, Japan; HLA, human leukocyte antigen.
