In this paper, we introduce the HisCoM-GGI software program, which provides a statistical test of identifying gene-level and SNP-level interactions for continuous phenotypes. We conclude that HisCoM-GGI software may be a valuable tool for the identification of genetic interactions, allowing us to better understand biological mechanisms of complex human diseases or related traits. The software is freely available with a tutorial dataset through the website http://statgen.snu.ac.kr/software/hiscom-ggi.
