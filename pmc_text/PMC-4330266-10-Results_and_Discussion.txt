Validation of model
Since the three-dimensional structure of rpoB of MTB was still not available, its structure model was predicted using the Phyre2 server by taking chain C of DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta from E. coli (PDB ID, 3LU0) [34] as the structural template. The query coverage of the target-template alignment was 91% with 100.0% confidence by the single highest-scoring template. The predicted structure was then subjected to the YASARA Energy Minimization Server for structural refinement. The total energy for the refined structure obtained from the YASARA Energy Minimization Server was -130,601.7 kcal/mol (score, -2.60),whereas prior to energy minimization, it was 359,868,668,000.6 kcal/mol (score, -4.20).
The stereochemistry of the refined model (Procheck analysis) revealed that 87.1% of residues were situated in the most favorable region, and 12.3% was in additional and generously allowed regions, whereas only 0.5% of residues fell in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3A). The ProSA-web evaluation revealed a compatible Z score (Fig. 3D) value of -12.3, which is well within the range of native conformations of crystal structures [22]. The overall residue energies of the rpoB 3D model were largely negative, except for a few peaks. The 3D model of rpoB showed a Levitt-Gerstein (LG) score of 4.065 by the Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool, implying a high accuracy level of the predicted structure. A ProQ LG score > 4.0 is necessary for suggesting that a model has extremely good quality [23].
The single amino acid mutation at codon 450 (i.e., Ser to Leu [TCG to TTG]) and at codon 445 (i.e., His to Tyr [CAC/TAC]) of the rpoB gene is reported to be the most widespread mutation, associated with RIF resistance [17]. Thus, mutant models of rpoB (S450L and H445Y) were generated and subjected to validation.
The stereochemistry of the rpoB (S450L) model (Procheck analysis) revealed that 89.3% of residues were situated in the most favorable region, and 9.9% was in additional allowed and generously allowed regions, whereas only 0.8% of residues fell in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3B). In the case of the rpoB (H445Y) model, 87.5% of residues were found in the most favorable region, and 11.6% was in additional and generously allowed regions; only 0.9% of residues fell in the disallowed region (Fig. 3C). The ProSA-web evaluation revealed a compatible Z score value of around -12.1 for both rpoB mutant models (i.e., S450L and H445Y) (Fig. 3E and 3F), which is well within the range of native conformations of crystal structures [22]. The overall residue energies of the rpoB 3D model were largely negative, expect for a few peaks. The 3D model of both mutants showed an LG score of more than 4.1 by the ProQ tool, implying a high accuracy level of the predicted structure. A ProQ LG score > 4 is necessary for suggesting that a model has extremely good quality [23].
