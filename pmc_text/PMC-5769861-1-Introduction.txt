Since its advent, high throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized the genomics research area, including transcriptome analysis and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) taking advantage of accelerated sequencing speed with reduced cost [1, 2]. Even though many bioinformatics software programs have been developed to handle and analyze the massive data generated from NGS, most of them are based on a command-line interface and require quite a high level of computational power [3], which creates a high barrier for wet lab biologists to enter into this field. Thanks to web-based analysis platforms, including Galaxy [4] and BIOEXPRESS [5], this barrier has been lowered. However, there still are problems. Downstream analyses, such as finding differentially expressed genes (DEGs), conducting Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, calculating linkage disequilibrium (LD), annotating gene information into GWAS results, and finally visualizing the resulting data, still require significant computer programming skills.
In this study, we present a dockerized application, IVAG. It provides a user-friendly web interface in which all downstream analyses mentioned above can be carried out without any programming knowledge. Detailed parameters for each analysis step can be adjusted with simple click-and-drag operation. IVAG interactively outputs publication-quality plots in response to the given parameters, and all of these plots can be downloaded. Also, a variety of data types, ranging from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and GWAS results to sequence read alignments, gene annotation, variant call information, and peak information, can be uploaded into the embedded genome browser and then visualized together to help users gain greater integrative insights into their data. Furthermore, IVAG is lightweight, allowing it to be deployed on a desktop computer, as well as a server application.
