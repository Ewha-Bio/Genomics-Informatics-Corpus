Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree showing the phylogenetic relationship of 16S rRNA gene sequences (A) and the concatenated sequences of gyrB-dnaK-tuf-murG-atpA-glyA genes obtained from 42 Flavobacterium species strains and Escherichia coli (B). Numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap values (shown as percentages of 1,000 replications). Scale bar, 0.05 substitutions per nucleotide position. Purple box indicates discordant cluster between two phylogenetic trees.
