Identification of a Copy Number Variation on Chromosome 20q13.12 Associated with Osteoporotic Fractures in the Korean Population
Osteoporotic fractures (OFs) are critical hard outcomes of osteoporosis and are characterized by decreased bone strength induced by low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration in bone tissue. Most OFs cause acute pain, hospitalization, immobilization, and slow recovery in patients and are associated with increased mortality. A variety of genetic studies have suggested associations of genetic variants with the risk of OF. Genome-wide association studies have reported various single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations (CNVs) in European and Asian populations. To identify CNV regions associated with OF risk, we conducted a genome-wide CNV study in a Korean population. We performed logistic regression analyses in 1,537 Korean subjects (299 OF cases and 1,238 healthy controls) and identified a total of 8 CNV regions significantly associated with OF (p < 0.05). Then, one CNV region located on chromosome 20q13.12 was selected for experimental validation. The selected CNV region was experimentally validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The CNV region of chromosome 20q13.12 is positioned upstream of a family of long non-coding RNAs, LINC01260. Our findings could provide new information on the genetic factors associated with the risk of OF.
