Dataset construction
All the protein sequences were downloaded from the UniProt database [31] available at http://www.uniprot.org/. The downloaded sequences, annotated as metal containing, were grouped into eight subsets. Each of the subsets, containing one of the metal species viz., calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc was considered to be metal-containing while all other entries were considered to be metal-free. Redundancy among the amino acid sequences was removed by clustering analysis using the cd-hit program [32] with the threshold of 50% level of percentage of identity, analogous by the UniRef 50 list [33] available in the UniProt database.
This resulted in eight data sets containing 186 calcium-containing proteins, 69 cobalt-containing proteins, 215 copper-containing proteins, 315 iron-containing proteins, 961 magnesium-containing proteins, 386 manganese-containing proteins, 74 nickel-containing proteins, and 1,716 zinc-containing proteins. All proteins containing calcium, cobalt, copper, magnesium, manganese, nickel, or zinc were then subtracted from the UniRef50 list, resulting in a collection of non-metalloproteins. The workflow of dataset construction is shown in Fig. 1. The problem of the imbalanced dataset can be solved as proposed by Cohen et al. [34]. Firstly, they pre-processes the data to re-establish class balance (either by upsizing the minority class or downsizing the majority class). Secondly, they modify the learning algorithm itself to copy with imbalanced data. In this study, we pre-processed the data which contains a balanced set of metal and non-metal ions. For this construction, nonâ€“metallo-proteins datasets sequences were randomly selected in order to have balanced set of metal and non-metal binding proteins for each metal ion, respectively.
