Epigenetic mechanisms. Variations in chromatin structure but not DNA sequences modulate the use of the genome by 1) DNA methylation, 2) histone modifications (methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation), 3) histone variant composition (dark), 4) chromatin remodeling (sparse or dense nucleosome occupancy), and noncoding RNAs.
