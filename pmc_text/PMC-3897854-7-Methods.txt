Plasmid preparation of MRP2 promoter
A pGL3 basic vector containing the human MRP2 promoter region (about 2.3 kb, -2314 to +348 relative to the translation initiation site) was constructed by our group in a previous study from homozygotic persons with MRP2 haplotypes 1, 2, and 3 [24]. The g.-1774delG polymorphism is located in haplotype 1, and the g.-24C > T polymorphism is located in haplotype 3. The reporter vector of a minor haplotype variant containing only the g.-1549G > A variation was constructed using mutagenic primers, introducing a -24 T â†’ C change to the plasmid of haplotype 3 containing both g.-1549G > A and g.-24C > T variations. Haplotype 2 includes no polymorphism (wild-type). In short, a total of five clones were prepared: pGL3 basic; haplotypes 1, 2, and 3; and g.-1549A alone.
