Expression levels of SNHG1 in colorectal cancers. Datasets obtained from Oncomine demonstrated that cecum adenocarcinomas (A) (fold change = 2.697, p = 5.22 × 10−14), rectal adenocarcinomas (B) (fold change = 3.333, p = 1.08 × 10−21), colon adenocarcinomas (C) (fold change = 2.806, p = 2.31 × 10−19), and colon mucinous adenocarcinomas (D) (fold change = 2.241, p = 1.10 × 10−10) significantly expressed high levels of PVT1 compared to the normal counterparts. SNHG1, small nucleolar RNA host gene 1; PVT1, plasmacytoma variant translocation 1.
