nc886 is a newly discovered ncRNA that controls PKR activity and plays tumor sensing and suppressing roles. nc886's expression pattern and function in tumors opens a possibility that its measurement can be a diagnostic or prognostic marker and its administration into cancer cells can be a therapeutic strategy. Nonetheless, we expect that nc886's role is multifaceted in cancer and may even be oncogenic in certain contexts, because nc886 expression as well as PKR's role can be in two opposite directions in cancer. Also, nc886 is a unique case of a Pol III gene that is epigenetically silenced in cancer and so provides an intriguing model for studying epigenetic regulation of Pol III.
