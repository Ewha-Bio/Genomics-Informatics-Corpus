Chromatin states of 9 cell lines from chr21: 33,031,600 to chr21: 33,041,600, shown in University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (GRCh37/hg19): the 15 chromatin states shown in the 4th field are numbered and abbreviated as: 1_Active_Promoter, 2_Weak_Promoter, 3_Poised_Promoter, 4_Strong_Enhancer, 5_Strong_Enhancer, 6_Weak_Enhancer, 7_Weak_Enhancer, 8_Insulator, 9_Txn_Transition, 10_Txn_Elongation, 11_Weak_Txn, 12_Repressed, 13_Heterochrom/lo, 14_Repetitive/CNV, and 15_Repetitive/CNV. These are the probabilistic categories based solely on the nine chromatin marks [1, 2].
