TM4SF5-mediated regulation of signaling molecules
TM4SF5 can appear to form TERMs on the cell surface, via formation of large protein-protein complexes with tetraspanins, integrins, and growth factor receptors [61, 69]. Therefore, by virtue of the protein complex formation, overexpressed TM4SF5 in cancer cells can influence or activate diverse intracellular signaling pathways for cell adhesion, proliferation, the EMT, migration, and invasion for tumor progression and maintenance.
TM4SF5 is shown to associate with integrins α2, β1 [70, 71], α5 [72], and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [73, 74] during cell migration [70, 71], angiogenesis [72], drug resistance [74], and fibrosis [73]. With association and retention of integrin α5 on the cell surface, TM4SF5 can activate intracellular signaling for FAK/c-Src activation, leading to STAT3 activity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induction [72]. In addition, TM4SF5 directly interacts with FAK or c-Src to regulate migration [75] and invasive ECM degradation [76]. In addition, TM4SF5 expression causes AKT activation, which in turn causes phosphorylation of p27Kip1 Ser10 for its cytosolic translocation, where it can regulate RhoA activity for morphological change and migratory function [74].
