Evaluation of dPCR screening of clinical samples from kidney transplant recipients
To investigate the clinical validity of dPCR for kidney transplantation monitoring, we screened a total of 34 kidney transplant patients' urine cfDNA samples collected at multiple time points after transplantation. Among the 34 patients, we selected 11 patients based on TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) availability to detect SNPs for donor-specific DNA (plasma samples n = 28, urine samples n = 25). We measured the total positive DNA counts, and the percentage of the total positive DNA counts that were from donor DNA (Fig. 4). In a pilot test, limited amounts of donor-specific DNA were detected in plasma cfDNA samples (mean, 1%; range, 0% to 10%). Conversely, in urine cfDNA samples, a large percentage of the total positive DNA counts were from donor DNA (mean, 55%; range, 6% to 100%). However, the differences in both total positive DNA counts, and donor DNA percentages, were not significant between clinical groups (Fig. 4). We next tested whether circulating mtDNA could be used to monitor graft status in transplant patients. We measured the circulating mtDNA levels in plasma and urine cfDNA samples from kidney transplant patients, using the mitochondrial variant marker mtDNA_12705. We found that the circulating mtDNA levels of transplant patients likewise could not be used to distinguish the clinical conditions of the patients (data not shown). The donor-specific cfDNA in urine samples was not consistent with the graft pathology, or the results of serum creatinine analysis (Fig. 5). Plasma donor-specific DNA was not detected in most cases, but when detected it was also inconsistent with graft function and patient status. These results indicate that SNP-based dPCR detection of donor DNA is not a useful diagnostic for determining the clinical conditions of kidney transplant patients.
