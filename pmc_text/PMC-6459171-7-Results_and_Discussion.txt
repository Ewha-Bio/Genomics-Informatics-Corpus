Lipid metabolism
Alveolar type II cells convert glycogen into phospholipids that are a major component of the surfactant proteins [8,52]. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) stimulates lipid metabolism in alveolar type II cells cultured on a matrix of collagen and matrigel [53]. Lung type II cells express lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and stearoyl-CoA desaturases (Scd1, Scd2) and transcription factors such as C/eba, Klf5, Srebf1, and Stat3 that are implicated in fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis [20,26,40]. It is interesting to note that Cebpa, Fasn, and Scd1 are also highly expressed in brown fat, adipose and liver tissues that are involved in lipid and energy metabolism [54]. Cebpa knockout mice display abnormalities in liver and adipose tissues as well as hyper proliferation of lung type II cells and disturbed alveolar architecture resulting in perinatal death [26,55]. Klf5 is required for lung development and knockout mice die perinatally due to respiratory distress and also have defects in surfactant and lipid metabolism [44]. Stat3 regulates Abca3 transporter expression and influences lamellar body formation in alveolar type II cells [20,56].
