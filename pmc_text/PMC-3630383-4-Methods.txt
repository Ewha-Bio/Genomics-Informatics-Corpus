Read mapping and alignment and variant analysis
We recently developed an in-house analysis pipeline for cancer genome sequencing data. This pipeline essentially includes 1) mapping and alignment, 2) discovery of sequence nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (indels), and 3) filtering and annotation of SNVs and indels. Briefly, once the raw sequence data were created, the output short reads were aligned to a reference genome (NCBI human genome assembly build 36) using UCSC hg19. Each alignment was assigned a mapping quality score by UCSC hg19, which is the Phred-scaled probability that the alignment is incorrect. The PCR duplicates were detected and removed by SAMTOOLS (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/). After alignment, we used GATK v1.4 to call SNVs for each chromosomal position. Filtering and annotation of SNVs and indels were performed using ANNOVAR (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/). We defined somatic mutation SNVs as those detected by both SomaticSniper and VarScan2 with a somatic p-value <0.05. We also set a minimum coverage of 5 in both normal and tumor samples. Conclusively, final somatic mutations were selected using the in-house filter.
