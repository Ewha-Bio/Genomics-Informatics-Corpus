Blood biochemistry
Blood samples were collected after 12-h fasting and were immediately placed in 4℃. For genotyping, whole blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated tubes. For other blood profiles, blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 min at 4℃. Serum samples were frozen at -80℃ until used. Levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A1, and C-reactive protein were measured by an auto analyzer (Boeringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated as described by the Friedewald and Laucer equation [18, 19]: LDL-C = TC - HDL-C-(TG/5). Levels of fasting glucose were measured by using an autoanalyzer (Ekachem DTSC module; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA). Fasting insulin was measured by glucotrend (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as described by Matthews equation [20]: HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5 × insulin (µL/mL), fasting glucose (mmol/L) = fasting glucose (mg/mL) × 0.0555.
