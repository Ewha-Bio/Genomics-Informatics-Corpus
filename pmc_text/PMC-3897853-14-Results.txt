Establishment and cellular morphology of H460R cells
Radioresistance means the relative resistance of cells, tissues, organs, or organisms to the injurious effects of IR. During the treatment period, recovery from radiation damage between fractions has been shown to increase tumor resistance against fractionated RT [3]. Radioresistance in vitro may be induced by exposure to small doses of IR [23]. To generate radiation-resistant cells, H460 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and irradiated with 2 Gy γ-rays at a dose rate of 3.2 Gy/min when cells approached 60% confluence. When the cells reached about 90% confluence, they were subcultured into new culture dishes. The cells were treated again with 2 Gy γ-rays at about 60% confluence. These procedures were repeated over a period of 24 mo. The parental cells were cultured under the same conditions without ionizing irradiation. These cells were designated H460R and utilized in this study.
The parental H460 cells typically appeared cobblestone-like and showed tight cell-cell junctions, which is characteristic of the epithelial phenotype. In contrast, H460R cells exhibited a spindle-like morphology and demonstrated a loss of cell-to-cell contact and an increase in cell scattering, as well as acidic vesicular organelles (Figs. 1A and 2A). Since a little difference in proliferative potential, such as cell cycle, has been reported between parental H460 and radioresistant H460R cells [23], we also examined whether established H460R cells are different from the parental H460 cells in cell proliferation, cell cycle, and ROS levels under physiologically normal conditions. Consistent with Lee et al.'s findings [23], no significant differences in cell proliferation, cell cycle, or ROS levels were observed between H460 and H460R cells under physiologically normal conditions (Fig. 1B, 1C, and 1D).
