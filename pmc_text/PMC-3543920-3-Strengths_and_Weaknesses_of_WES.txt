WES is a robust technology that is extremely practical for investigating coding variation at the genome-wide level. Despite the plummeting cost of sequencing in the past few years, WES at mean coverage depth of 100× still costs five times less than whole genome sequencing (WGS) at mean coverage depth 30×. In addition, the size of WES data per patient is approximately a sixth of WGS data, resulting in reduced processing time and imposing less of a burden in terms of data storage.
However, it is important to understand the limitations of WES technology. Certain protein-coding regions might not be covered due to incomplete annotation of the human genome. Further, WES does not cover potentially functional non-coding elements, including untranslated regions, enhancers, and long-noncoding RNAs, although these are, in themselves, not clearly defined. Another drawback to WES is the limited ability to detect structural variations, such as copy-number variations, translocations, and inversions.
In spite of these limitations, WES is still the tool of choice for many researchers-its practical advantages allow large numbers of patients to be screened in a robust fashion, a crucial aspect of mutation discovery in human genetics research.
