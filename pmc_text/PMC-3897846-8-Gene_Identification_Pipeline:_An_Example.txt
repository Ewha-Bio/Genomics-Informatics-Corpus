Variant discovery
- Initial variant discovery. The GATK UnifiedGenotyper tool is used to perform initial raw variant calling and output VCF files.
- Variant recalibration and filtering. SNPs and indels are processed separately but in a similar manner; so, we will only describe SNPs as an example. The GATK Select-Variants tool is used to select SNPs within the exome regions from raw VCF files. The VariantRecalibrator tool is then used to build Gaussian models for recalibration, followed by the ApplyRecalibration tool to apply models for SNP recalibration. Low-quality SNPs are then removed by imposing a filtering step, based on a user-defined variant quality score recalibration (VQSR) score threshold. After SNPs and indels are reprocessed, the GATK CombineVariants tool is used to combine the recalibrated SNPs and indels.
