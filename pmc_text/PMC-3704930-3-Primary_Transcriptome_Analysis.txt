In bacteria, cellular RNA comprises primary transcripts that are marked by a 5'-triphosphate (5'PPP) group and processed or degraded RNAs that carry either a 5'-monophosphate (5'P) or 5'-hydroxyl group (5'OH) [7, 9]. In particular, primary transcriptome analysis is beneficial for improving the annotation of any sequenced bacterial genome. Due to the absence of a poly(A) tail at the 3'-end and the instability of mRNAs with very short half-lives, however, bacterial primary transcriptome analysis has been challenging [8]. Also, cellular RNA was considered to consist mainly of rRNA and tRNA in prokaryotic cells; therefore, mRNA enrichment is essential to determine the primary transcriptome from RNA-seq. Differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) enriches RNA samples for primary transcripts by use of a 5'P-dependent terminator exonuclease (TEX) that specifically degrades RNAs carrying a 5'P, leading to relative enrichment of primary transcripts and depletion of processed RNAs. Then, the 5'-end positions of the primary transcripts can be identified by comparison of cDNA libraries generated with and without TEX treatment (Fig. 1B) [9, 31, 33-36]. The 5'-end of RNA transcripts, corresponding to the TSS, is mostly related with the regulation of transcribed genes, including promoters, ribosome binding sites, transcription factor binding sites, antisense RNAs (asRNAs), and other regulatory noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs).
