The need for data storage is rapidly and continuously growing. DNA data storage has the potential to eventually replace magnetic tape, the most commercially available storage for archiving.
We have proposed a new method for reading digital information into a DNA fragment. The method is different to prior work, which synthesized novel DNA sequences, depending on the digital data to be scored. Our approach is more scalable than prior methods, in that we can reuse pre-synthesized DNA for the data block (“0” and “1” signal sequences), which means there is no need to wait for de novo synthesis of DNA.
Using nano-pore sequencing with long reads has an advantage in the amount of times required to restore digital information from DNA molecules. Our current achievements show 3‒4 h for sequencing, which is much faster than prior works that made use of next-generation sequencing. As sequencing can be conducted in a parallel manner, our approach has more potential in restoring large amounts of data in a sort time.
We hope these advances may contribute to viable, large-scale DNA-based data storage.
