Implementation screen
The IABio platform uses the authorization server provided in Naver API [12]. Therefore, it can acquire an authorization token in Naver and can have access to the portal by using it. To access the authorization server, only a pre-authorized Naver ID can be used. Therefore, a token can be issued or re-issued only when having client information. The left side of Fig. 7 shows the page to access the web portal, and the right side is the page to receive authorization tokens through Naver.
As seen in Fig. 8, login is done to the authorization server with client information. Then, it is possible to have access to the web portal of IABio. The right side of Fig. 8 shows the contents of personal information and the authorization token received from Naver. The authorization token is transmitted in the encryption of AES 256. The contents are those of decoded authorization tokens.
Figs. 9 and 10 are output results made by query from the data saved in the genome database. It is a screenshot of sample data, not actual clinical data. Actual data can not be printed out due to the Medical Care Act. Fig. 9 shows the screen that confirms the patient's basic information. Only personnel who are authorized for access to it can read it. Fig. 10 is a screenshot that confirms protein data. Only the personnel who are authorized for access to protein data can read it.
