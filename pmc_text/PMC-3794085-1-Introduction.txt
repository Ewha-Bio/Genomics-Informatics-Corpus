Orthostasis causes a gravitational shift in circulating blood from the intra-thoracic space to lower extremities and reduces venous return to the heart. This transient increase in sympathetic tone and decrease in parasympathetic tone and these normal cardiovascular reflexes cause an increase in heart rate and vascular resistance, restoring normal blood pressure (BP) and cardiac output [1]. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is the failure of the cardiovascular reflexes to maintain BP on standing from a supine position [2]. The Malmö Preventive Project reported that individuals with OH had significantly increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.4 to 1.6) [3].
OH has been defined by the international consensus as a decrease in systolic BP ≥ 20 mm Hg and/or a decrease in diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 mintues of standing [4]. The prevalence of OH varies from 5% to 30%, depending greatly on the population being studied [5-7]. Aging is associated with a definite increase in the prevalence of OH and was reviewed in Benvenuto and Krakoff [2]. In addition to the aging effects, OH is more prevalent in hypertensive [8, 9], neurological [10], and diabetic patients [11, 12]. The all-cause mortality rate was higher in patients with OH than in those without OH [6, 7]
We have been conducting an epidemiology study of OH as part of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) and previously reported that middle-aged adults (40-70 years), enrolled from 2001 to 2002, had a 12.3% overall prevalence of OH and that the OH frequency increased significantly with age, from 6.4% in those aged 40-44 years to 23.1% in those aged 65-69 (p < 0.001) [9]. In addition, the study confirmed the correlations between OH and hypertension, body mass index (BMI), and type 2 diabetes [9].
The genetic contribution to OH can be hypothesized that the frequency of OH in families with a history of essential hypertension is higher than in the general population [4]. A genetic association study was conducted by Luo et al. [13], and they identified a functional variant of NEDD4L (epithelial sodium channel E3-ubiquitin ligase).
To identify genetic factors associated with OH trait in Koreans, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for OH case controls using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and also tested supine and standing BPs as quantitative traits.
