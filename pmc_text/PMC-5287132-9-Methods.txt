Sub-cellular localization of unique essential metabolic proteins
The program PSORTb V.3.0 (http://www.psort.org/psortb/index.html), CELLO (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/), and SOSUI (http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_submit.html) server was used to characterize whether the proteins are soluble or trans-membrane in nature. This computational tool illustrates where the protein resides in the cell. So if the protein is associated with the cell membrane, there is more possibility that it can be highlighted as a potential therapeutic target [2627].
