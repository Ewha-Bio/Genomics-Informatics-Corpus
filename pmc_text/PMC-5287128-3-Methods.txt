Data collection by text-mining and data analysis
Pathway Studio software 9.0 (Elsevier, Atlanta, GA, USA) was used to collect information on biological processes and diseases related to kimchi, based on information in the Korean Food Standard Reference (KFSR). Pathway Studio software allows the automatic extraction of regulatory and physical interactions from MEDLINE abstracts using a natural-language-processing technology called MedScan [11]. Interactions extracted by MedScan, which contain a formalized set of relationships, are imported into the Pathway Studio database and analyzed further using data-mining tools for knowledge inference [12]. Since MedScan keeps the reference of the original article with information on the extracted interaction, it also allows a quick review of extracted facts and identification of relevant publications. Thus, it facilitated our pathway reconstruction by selecting the appropriate interactions. All interactions found were manually curated, and only validated interactions were included in the pathways.
