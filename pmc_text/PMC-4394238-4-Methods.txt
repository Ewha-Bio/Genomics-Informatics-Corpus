Ontology
From a computer science perspective, ontology is defined as the structure representing a shared, formal, and explicit specification of knowledge in a particular domain (e.g., biology). Hendler [19] describes ontology as a set of knowledge terms, containing the terminology (domain vocabulary), all essential concepts in the domain, the semantic interconnections, and simple rules of logic and inference for some particular topics. A typical example of an ontology approach in biology is using standard concepts to classify microorganisms. There are a large number of identified microbes in nature, so that this amount has long stimulated interest to establish an anthological classification for them. Gene Ontology (GO) is another example of an ontology application in biology. GO is intended to formulize biological knowledge in orthogonal hierarchies [20]. It includes controlled vocabularies that are described for gene products with respect to their biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions [21]. Ontology specification languages are knowledge representation languages used to encode ontologies in a formal (machine-readable and -processable) and standard format. The most common and popular ontology language is OWL from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). OWL concepts/classes (e.g., genome, gene, etc.) are created using formal specifications that an individual object/instance (e.g., genome and gene instances) needs to satisfy to belong to a particular class. The individuals that share similar characteristics would be members of the same concept.
