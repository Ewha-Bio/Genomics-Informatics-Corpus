QC and results
We had used several methods to check the qualities of sequence reads. First, we used NGS QC Tools [4] to confirm sequence qualities (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, they had a very good quality, according to NGS QC Tools results. Template length (library size) was also evenly distributed for all samples (Supplementary Fig. 1).
