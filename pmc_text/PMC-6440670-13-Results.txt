Nanopore sequencing
The DNA fragment storing digital information with a size of 1,854 bp, which is a longer length than the commercially available Sanger sequencing limit, was sequenced by Oxford nanopore sequencing method. The total number of reads obtained was 104,795. Out of 104,795 reads obtained, 675 reads were identical to the expected size of 1,854 bp. A total of 16,773 reads were found within 50 bp of the expected size (Fig. 7). There were also reads with lengths of 1,100 bp. Those reads were possibly from unligated product during the DNA fragment preparation process.
Sampling of thousand reads their length is between 1,754 and 1,904 were assembled by “Canu” method to retrieve a consensus sequence. The consensus sequence showed 100% identity to the designed sequence that stored digital data. This means that digital information can be restored directly from the consensus sequence without any further sequence data treatment. However, sampling a fewer number of reads reduces the identity of the designed sequence.
We also considered 672 reads with the same length as the designed sequence. From these reads, we were able to successfully identify “start,” “end,” and “data block” sequences. The data block of the reads was aligned, minimizing Hamming distance. Voting of the aligned reads for a signal of “0” and “1” yielded the digital information intended to be stored. This shows that it is capable of reading digital information written in the long-read DNA by our method.
Our approach tolerates the low accuracy of nano-pore sequencing, which is capable of reading a long-read-length DNA up to 10 kb. Prior work on data storage in DNA molecules has been focused on using Illumina sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), which supports a shorter read length (∼150 bp) but provides high accuracy. Thus, our scheme is the first trial to enable writing DNA in longer fragments. Depending on the choice of sequencing technology, there are gains and losses. A comparison with prior work shows that our data storing scheme requires more base pairs to store 1 byte than other technology. However our method requires significantly less sequencing time to recover digital information (Table 1).
