Analysis plan
In this study, we considered a prediction model and process in terms of performance and interpretability. The main steps of our analysis were as follows: (1) gene filtration, (2) pre-screening, (3) gene marker selection, and (4) integrated study of selected gene markers and the final prediction model.
