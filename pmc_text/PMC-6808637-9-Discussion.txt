GWAS p-value and accuracy of TC calculation
In GWASs, the significance is guaranteed by the p-value. The p-value is the criteria to dissect the significant variants and those genes from insignificant ones. Although genes’ effects were dissected by the p-value, only the beta effect was used for TC calculation. The gene’s GWAS p-value and beta effect can be varied with respect to analyzed phenotypes. The highly accurate TC calculation should be certified by using diverse phenotypes in GWAS. Additionally, the transcript reads in RNA-seq data can be diverse in various tissues. By using diverse tissues and information from various traits, the accurate TC calculation can be plausible for generally acceptable estimation.
BF% can be used to approximate fat accumulation in adipose tissues. The trait reflects the fat accumulation and the gene’s play in adipose tissue. The GWAS directs the significant variants associated with body fat but the TC quantity only mirrors the transcript activity only related to the analyzed traits as indicated by TC unit (BF%).
Our GWAS calculation for the gene effect was based on the linkage disequilibrium between SNP markers and the gene. Despite the advantages of GWAS using SNP markers, diverse SNP markers per gene can cause a problem. Thus gene-based GWAS can be an another alternative method. And RNA-seq data had better be obtained from the similar sample to the GWAS dataset.
The neuronal and cell projection organization genes were enriched in the GO analysis (Table 2). These genes have low p-values in the GWAS analysis of BF% across the board. Inspecting the relationship between TC and GO terms why the lowest TC values are associated with certain GO terms, is a subject that needs to be addressed. Likewise, the reason why wound healing and embryo development GO terms have low TC values must be elucidated.
