Analysis of tag intensity and signal ratio
The probe intensity was obtained using the GeneChip Scanner 3000 and GeneChip Operating Software (Expression-Affymetrix MAS) with high-resolution upgrades. In brief, scanning of GeneChips generated a variety of data in multiple file formats, including .EXP, .DAT, .CEL, and .CDF. Among them, the.CEL files harboring probe intensity data were then analyzed using the R package ‘affy’ [13]. The signal ratio (Fig. 4) and the distribution of tag signals (Figs. 5 and 7 ) were plotted by kernel density plots, implemented in the R statistical software [14].
