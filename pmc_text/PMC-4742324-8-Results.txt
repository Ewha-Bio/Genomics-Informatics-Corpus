The biological functions of genes under positive selection
We performed functional enrichment analysis on the following genes under positive selection using DAVID ver. 6.7: ST6GALNAC2 and EPHX1 in Yorkshire; PARK2 in Landrace; and BMP6, SLA-DQA1, and PRKG1 in Duroc. The results revealed enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway terms related to metabolism, diseases, genetic or environmental information processing, and organismal systems (Table 3). The gene BMP6 acts as a hedgehog signaling pathway; the hedgehog protein is an important regulator of slow oxidative fiber clustering and is distributed throughout the tissue in pigs. Previous research has reported that BMP6 plays an important role in meat quality [8]. Among the 26 positively selected genes in Yorkshire, the ST6GALNAC2 gene is expressed during lactation, contributing to immune-related functions [5]. Up-regulation of the EPHX1 (epoxide hydrolase 1) gene occurs during mammary gland involution. Nakamura et al. [6] suggested that EPHX1 is involved in the initial stage of involution. The SEMA5A (semaphoring 5A) gene for Yorkshire reported strong candidate gene which affects the milk production traits for economic traits in cattle. The estrogen receptor (ER) gene for Landrace reported that mice lacking ER Î± show severe reproduction [7]. This implies that the ER gene might be a positively selected lactation trait in pigs. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms included immune system process (SLA-DQA1) and metabolic process (PRKG1) for Duroc (Supplementary Table 2). Williams et al. [3] reported that a low level of chronic immune system resulted in greater growth in pigs. These results suggest that the 26, 7, and 14 population-specific genes with significant signals may result from potential positive selection for lactation in Yorkshire, reproduction in Landrace, and meat-quality and growth traits in Duroc.
