Collection of DNA methylation array data of human whole blood with age and gender information
We obtained DNA methylation microarray data from the NCBI GEO database (Fig. 1). We collected datasets of normal human blood samples in which both age and gender data were available. As a result, we collected a total of 4,862 samples for Infinium 450K HumanMethylation array data (Table 1).
