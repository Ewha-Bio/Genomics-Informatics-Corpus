Statistical analysis
The orthostatic BP changes were calculated by deltaBP = mean supine position BP - standing position BP. Delta systolic blood pressures (dtSBP), delta diastolic blood pressure (dtDBP), and OH cases (dtSBP ≥ 20 and/or dtDBP ≥ 10 [16]) were analyzed by linear or logistic regression, controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, BMI, and systolic BP. Statistical analyses were performed using PLINK version 1.07, using default options [17] and SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The GWAS were conducted for Ansan and Ansung separately. The Ansan GWAS and Ansung replication study results were combined by inverse-variance meta-analysis method, assuming fixed effects, with Cochran's Q test used to assess between-study heterogeneity [18]. The selected SNPs had a common MAF (>0.05) and the population heterogeneity (p > 0.05). The asymptotic HWE tests were conducted using PLINK, and all the reported p-values were two-sided.
