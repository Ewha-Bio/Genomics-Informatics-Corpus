Differential response of H460R cells to γ-irradiation
It has been known that radioresistant cells have some characteristics, such as DNA repair and anti-apoptotic properties, in response to IR as well as other anticancer drugs [23]. Next, we checked the response to IR between parental H460 cells and resistant H460R cells. A colony formation assay indicated that H460R cells were more resistant to cell death than parental cells after 4 and 6 Gy irradiation (Fig. 3A and 3B). In addition, cell cycle analysis showed that H460 cells were subjected to early apoptosis, whereas H460R cells were arrested at the G2/M phase. Subsequently, the subG1 fraction in H460 cells was increased 2-fold over H460R cells after 24 h with IR (Fig. 3C). From these results, we considered H460R cells to be radioresistant. To evaluate the cellular response to IR, levels of proteins with respect to DNA damage and cell cycle were analyzed. IR led to enhanced phosphorylation of p53 in the parental cells compared with H460R cells. While γ-H2AX expression appeared after 8 h and peaked 32 h after IR in parental cells, it was only slightly induced in radioresistant H460R cells. Moreover, p21, p27, and cyclin B1 remained increased in response to IR in H460R cells. We also observed that the cleaved form of PARP increased in H460 cells after 8 h and peaked after 32 h, whereas a slight increase of cleaved PARP was observed in H460R cells (Fig. 3D). X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression levels increased in H460R cells but decreased in parental cells after IR exposure. To test whether IR induced upregulation of ER stress in the two cell lines, we performed Western blot analysis for representative marker proteins, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), and CHOP. In parental cells, GRP78 and CHOP increased in a time-dependent manner in response to IR up to 24 h and decreased after 32 h of IR, while expression of GRP94 decreased in a time-dependent manner following IR. Moreover, IR decreased GRP78 but increased GRP94 and CHOP slightly, which were rarely detected, regardless of IR in radioresistant cells (Fig. 3E).
