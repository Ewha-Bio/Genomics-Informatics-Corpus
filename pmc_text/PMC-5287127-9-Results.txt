Selection of candidate CNV regions
To select candidate CNV regions, we manually performed a visual inspection to classify well-clustered “multiple-class” regions into genotype groups. In total, 3,660 multiple-class CNV regions were selected for the association study. Of the 3,660 CNV regions, 518 CNV regions were two-class regions (one and two copies) and 3,142 were three-class regions (zero, one, and two copies) (Supplementary Fig. 1).
