Normalization
Most popular normalization protocols employ either on-plate control-based or sample-based methods. Although there is no golden rule for this, we prefer the latter for most siRNA screens, as 1) cell-based siRNA screening is vulnerable to within-plate variation, such as an edge effect and column/row effects that are not corrected by on-board controls [4], and 2) because siRNA hits are often rare within a given test plate, the majority of samples proxies the mock control. Therefore, siMacro currently only supports normalization by samples at the resolution of a plate, row, and column. Depending on the cellular phenotype and experimental design, the optimal choice of resolution varies and can therefore be specified by the screener. If row or column effects are trivial or there are more than 10-30 hits per 96-well plate, a user can choose plate median normalization (default). As many liquid dispensers move row-wise, a row effect is very common in the siRNA screens. If the hits/plate is less than 10 per 96-well plate and accompanied by a significant row effect, row-median normalization is a better choice.
