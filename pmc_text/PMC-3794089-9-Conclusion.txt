In this study, torsion angle-based representation of the protein backbone structure was utilized for the construction of a secondary structure information repository and analysis tool of pair-wise structure comparison. This web application provides a search interface for deposited secondary structures of PDB and SCOP entries and a secondary structure calculation utility for the user's own structures. It also supports a pair-wise protein structure comparison utility that is more accurate than the typical 3D alignment method in both cases of clear functional differences, as shown here, and very similar functional homologies, as shown previously [1]. The web server tries to explain in as much detail as possible the changes and occurrence of exceptions along the computational processes.
A secondary structure search through a query string using sequence alignment algorithms might be possible for further improvements. Future protein structure research might be aided more through a secondary and tertiary structure homology search utility. A tertiary and quaternary structural information repository might be possible to be newly built by automatically utilizing the possibility of 1D representations of protein structures using backbone torsion angles and better accuracy of structural homology delineations of the comparison tool that was provided here. The information derived from this web application might be further utilized in the field of ab initio protein structure modeling or protein homology-related analyses.
