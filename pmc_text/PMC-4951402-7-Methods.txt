Association with previously identified loci
We attempted to determine similarities between our selected markers and five other genes, which have previously been identified as indicative of osteoporosis in Korean male populations. Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 11 (TNFSF11) on 13q14, FOXL1 on 16q24, LRP5 on 11q13.4, ZBTB40 on 1q31.3, and MEF2C on 5q14 have been connected to BMD in several different genome-wide association studies (GWASs)â€”an association confirmed in Korean males by a number of replication studies [1314]. We examined the most significant SNP regions of these five genes by applying our markers and considering only results with a p < 0.05.
