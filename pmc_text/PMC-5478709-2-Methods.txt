Study subjects
A total of 1,138 individuals (572 AS patients and 566 healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. All of them were from our previous CNV discovery study [1113]. All AS cases were diagnosed according to the Modified New York Criteria [14]. This study was performed with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of the College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea (CUMC10U170). The patients were aged 26.7 ± 11.8 years (85.3% male and 14.7% female), and 97.9% of them were HLA-B27–positive. The controls were aged 23.9 ± 11.8 years (94.7% male and 5.3% female), and 2.6% of them were HLA-B27–positive.
