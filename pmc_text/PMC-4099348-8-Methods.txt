Short read alignment and variation calling
A total of 76-bp paired-end or single-end sequence reads with ~200-bp insert size were aligned to the human reference genome (NCBI build 37, hg19) with BWA algorithm1 ver. 0.5.8c and default parameters [13]. Two mismatches were permitted in a 45-bp seed sequence. Putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small INDELs were called by the pileup vcf function of Samtools (ver.0.1.9) [14]. The options used in filtering variations were a minimum of 6 for mapping depth and quality threshold of 50 for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and 20 for small INDELs. Predicted SNVs were compared with NCBI dbSNP version 131 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) to remove known SNP information. Non-synonymous SNV information was extracted by comparing UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) reference gene information with the somatic mutation list in the COSMIC cancer information database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). PolyPhen (polymorphism phenotyping) was utilized to predict possible changes in protein structure and function resulting from a non-synonymous amino acid change.
