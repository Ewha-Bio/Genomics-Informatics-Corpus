Subtractive proteomics
The complete protein datasets of B. petrii (whole genome project accession No. PRJNA28135) were retrieved from Genome database of National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/genome/). The essentiality search [26] was carried out through the Database of Essential Gene (DEG) for screening out the essential proteins responsible for the survival of B. petrii in the host. The bit score parameter was considered as greater or equal to 100 for homology search using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) while accessing DEG (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/blast.php) database, to select bacterial essential proteins. The non-redundancy search was performed through CD-HIT (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi) web server to remove the redundant proteins among selected essential proteins of B. petrii. Further, by considering the resulted proteins of B. petrii, the sequence similarity search was carried out against human [272829] followed by human gut flora microorganisms [3031] using BLASTP algorithm to eliminate proteins homologous with human and human gut flora microorganisms respectively. During similarity search, the threshold for expected value (e-value) was fixed as greater or equal to 0.001. Furthermore, the protein sequences which are putative, unknown, hypothetical, probable, conserved hypothetical and unnamed protein were removed manually. The study of sub cellular localization was performed to identify the cytoplasm proteins among the selected proteins [32] using CELLO (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/). Generally, proteins are annotated and ranked as per their evidence level in UniProt database which is also a factor to be considered while selecting putative drug targets. Afterwards, the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) was explored, and the virulence proteins were screened out (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/blast/blast.html) among the selected targets of B. petrii through VFDB BLASTP search against VFDB core data sets with consideration of threshold e-value as greater than 0.0001 [31]. The above methodology is described through a flow diagram (Fig. 1A).
