Decades after the discovery of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) organism, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in several developing countries. Nearly one-third of the world's population is considered to be infected with MTB infection, with 8.6 million new patients and 1.3 million deaths in the year 2012, including 3,20,000 deaths among human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals, with around 2.0-2.4 million infected cases of TB in India alone-i.e., 26% of the total burden [1]. Multidrug-resistant strains of this pathogen, emerging in association with human immunodeficiency virus, have added a frightening dimension to the problem [2]. Outbreaks of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis have also been an increasing threat in certain regions around the world [3]. Most drug-resistant MTB clinical strains are resistant to the frontline anti-TB drugs isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazine) and rifampicin (RIF) [4]. RIF belongs to the rifamycin group and is a bactericidal antibiotic drug introduced in 1963 [5]. It inhibits bacterial DNA-dependent RNA synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase [6, 7]. It has a complex structure, having a molecular weight 822.95 g/mol and containing an aromatic nucleus (Fig. 1) linked on both sides by an aliphatic bridge [8].
Due to the lipophilic profile of the MTB cell membrane, RIF diffuses easily across it [9]. It inhibits bacterial RNA synthesis by binding to the Î² subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus blocking RNA transcription [6] by inhibiting RNA chain initiation and elongation [10]. Even though the molecular target of RIF has been well distinguished, the specific mechanism by which it interacts with rpoB to lead to mycobacterial killing remains unclear [8].
RIF resistance is mainly due to mutations in a well-defined, 81-base-pair central region of the rpoB gene [11]. More than 96% of RIF-resistant strains contain a mutation in this 81-bp region of rpoB [12, 13]. The mutation that is most frequently found in clinical isolates of MTB is rpoB S531L. In MTB from countries around the world, rpoB S450L (S531L in the case of Escherichia coli) was identified in 40%-93% of all RIF resistance isolates [14,15,16].The single amino acid mutation at codon 445 (i.e., His to Tyr [CAC/TAC]) of the rpoB gene is also reported to be the most widespread mutation, associated with RIF resistance [17]. The rapid advances in molecular biology and the accessibility of new information generated after whole-genome sequencing of MTB will be useful in understanding the mechanism of RIF resistance. In this study, we explored the interaction of rpoB (both wild and mutant proteins) with RIF through molecular docking analysis.
