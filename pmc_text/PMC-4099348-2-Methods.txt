Preparation of genomic DNA from cancer cell lines
We ordered normal genomic DNA sample from the Coriell Institute Cell Repository (CCR ID NA17022; Camden, NJ, USA), which originated from a normal Caucasian male of European descent. For cancer genomic DNAs, H-1650 and H-23 cancer cells were cultured and harvested for DNA preparation. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted with the QIAamp DNA blood kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA quality and quantity were assessed with the use of a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).
