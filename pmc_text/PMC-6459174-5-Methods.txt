Data analyses
Mann–Whitney U-test was performed using the SPSS version 21 Statistics software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to test the significance of differences in continuous variables between the mitochondrial haplogroup F and results from the physical performance tests. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust the distribution of gender between athletes and controls. The test of cross tabulation analyses and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in a 2 × 2 table was calculated using a statistical analysis program available on the internet (SISA, http://www.quantitativeskills.com/sisa). Since mtDNA is haploid, the markers of mtDNA are in linkage disequilibrium. Since haplogroup comparisons are not independent, the adjustment of p-values for mtDNA haplogroups is not recommended for multiple testing [29]. In line with this literature reported recommendation, the p-values for multiple testing were not adjusted.
