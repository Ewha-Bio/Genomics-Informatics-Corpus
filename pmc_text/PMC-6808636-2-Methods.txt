Summary of the cohorts
A detailed description of the study samples can be found in the original WTCCC GWAS paper [4]. In summary, the WTCCC dataset includes cases of seven major complex diseases: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, bipolar disorder, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease, each with ~2,000 individuals, and ~3,000 shared controls from two cohorts. Among them, we only used the two control cohorts. The control samples were derived from two sources: half from the 1958 Birth Cohort (58C) and the remainder from UKBS samples.
The 1958 Birth Cohort (also known as the National Child Development Study) consists of all births in England, Wales, and Scotland in 1958. The second control group consists of 1,500 blood donors recruited from the UKBS in England, Scotland, and Wales.
