Association analysis of hypertension
We examined 2,945 SNPs of 237 genes for a hypertension case control study by logistic regression analysis; 68 genes were significantly associated with hypertension (p < 0.05) (Table 3). The most significant SNP was rs2889611 within mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8; p = 2.70 × 10-5; odds ratio [OR], 0.82; confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.90), and rs1356415 from PROM1 and rs4536994 from KDR were strongly associated with hypertension (p = 3.45 × 10-4; OR, 1.18; CI, 1.08 to 1.29 and p = 3.73 × 10-4; OR, 1.19; CI, 1.08 to 1.31, respectively).
