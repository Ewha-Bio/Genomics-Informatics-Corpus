Antibacterial DNA gyrase of Staphylococcus aureus retrieval
The three-dimensional structure of topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria origin was retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB ID: 2XCT). The 3D crystal structure of this protein had a resolution of 3.35Ã…, and it is available in conjugation with small molecules, 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-7-piperazin-1-yl-1, 4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (CPF) and stabilized by manganese(II) ions. The topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme is composed of two subunits; one is the DNA gyrase subunit-A and another one is the DNA gyrase subunit-B. The 3D structure consists of four chains B, D, S, and U with a size of 692 amino acids (Fig. 1).
