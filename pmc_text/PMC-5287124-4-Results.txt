In Table 1 and Fig. 1, a summary and trend of several characteristics of the haplotype block partition results are presented for five methods applied to each experiment data of 1000G and HapMap datasets. For each method with a sampling ratio setting, we calculated the total number of blocks, the average r2 values for all pairs of SNPs within a block and the average r2 values for pairs of which each SNP belongs to consecutive blocks, and the average size of haplotype blocks in terms of the number of SNPs in a block and the base-pair (bp) length of haplotype blocks. When we compared the haplotype block partition results based on 20% of original SNP markers to the results based on all SNPs in the 1000G dataset, the total number of haplotype blocks was reduced to about 40% in the CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++ results and to about 30% in the FGT and SS results. Excluding the singleton blocks from the comparison, the amount of reduction was about 40% for all methods. For CI, PLINK-MIG++ and S-MIG++, the average length of the haplotype blocks based on 20% of original SNP markers in 1000G dataset was about 1.8 times of the length of the blocks produced using all SNPs for CI, PLINK-MIG++ and S-MIG++ and about 2.4 times for FGT and SS. With changes of sampling ratio of SNP markers, the average r2 within a same block remained almost unchanged, but the average r2 across consecutive blocks increased with the sampling ratio. The average r2 of S-MIG++ within a block and across consecutive blocks are slightly lower and higher than that of CI and PLINK-MIG++ and the difference in the haplotype block sizes is greater than the two methods even though S-MIG++ uses the same operational definition for LD block, which shows the fractional sampling methods adopted by S-MIG++ for computational efficiency also affects the LD block construction results.
Fig. 2 shows the LD heatmaps of an example region with the markers of haplotype blocks obtained by each method for five 1000G datasets of different sampling ratios and the HapMap dataset. We could observe that the big haplotype block regions that maintain strong LD in substantial proportion of SNP pairs are partitioned into several small blocks when using the entire SNP markers of 1000G dataset due to some breaks in the LD streaks, but with low sampling ratio subsets, many of these breaks disappear resulting in bigger sized haplotype blocks produced. The number of haplotype blocks obtained using the HapMap data was similar to the number of haplotype blocks obtained using 20% of SNPs of the original marker sets of 1000G dataset. However, actual locations of haplotype blocks obtained from two datasets were a little different.
In Fig. 3, we plotted the distributions of the length of the haplotype blocks produced from the 1000G datasets with different density levels and the HapMap dataset, for each method. The distribution of the length of haplotype blocks obtained from the HapMap dataset was similar to the one obtained from the 1000G dataset with 20% of the original markers. The frequencies of the haplotype blocks with length less than 30 kb decreases with the reducing density levels, but these frequencies were rather similar for big haplotype blocks in the results by all methods.
In Fig. 4, we present the proportions of commonly found haplotype blocks for each experimental dataset compared to the 1000G dataset with all SNP markers for each method. Only 7%–10% of the haplotype blocks that are obtained using the entire SNP markers in the 1000G dataset are also observed in the result using 20% of the original SNP markers for CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++ based on the 80% overlap criterion for common observation considering all blocks or excluding singleton blocks in the comparison. These proportions are even smaller for FGT and SS, only 3%– 6% of haplotype blocks constructed from the entire markers are found when using 20% of original markers. When we compared only the haplotype blocks with sizes greater than 5,000 bp or 10,000 bp, the proportions of commonly found haplotype blocks from the datasets of all SNPs and 20% of SNPs increase to 21%–28% for CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++ whereas these proportions increase only to 8%– 15% for FGT and SS. The effect of the density on the discovery of common haplotype blocks with results of full marker set was more severe in the results of FGT and SS compared to the other methods.
