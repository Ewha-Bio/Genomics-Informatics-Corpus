Data
CNVs of our previous study were retrieved from the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 of 3,578 Korean individuals. A total of 4,003 CNVRs were defined, and 2,077 CNVRs (51.9%) were potentially novel. The annotation data for genes were collected based on the Human Mar. 2006 NCBI36/hg18 build, and reference structure variants were retrieved from DGV (hg18.v8.aut.2009).
