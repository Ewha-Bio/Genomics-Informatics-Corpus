Statistical analysis
The genetic models for the association test were divided according to additive (AA vs. Aa vs. aa), dominant (AA vs. Aa plus aa), and recessive (AA plus Aa vs. aa) models. The Ï‡2 test was used to assess the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the SR, HEP, CIR, and CLD groups. The difference between groups was determined by the odds ratio (OR). ORs were presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and adjusted for age and sex. Each individual haplotype was inferred from the EM algorithm using the SAS haplotype procedure (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks were checked by the Gabriel method using Haploview software (version 4.2; Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA). All statistical tests were performed using SAS software, and the significance level was set at p < 0.05. The probability values obtained were corrected for multiple testing by using Bonferroni's correction and permutation test. Bonferroni's p-value for reaching significance was 0.025 (0.05/2). The Plink program was used to confirm the results and permutation test (n = 100,000; http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/).
