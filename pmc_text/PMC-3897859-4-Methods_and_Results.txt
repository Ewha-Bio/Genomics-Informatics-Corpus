Reserve architecture and design
Human Papillomavirus Proteome Database (hpvPDB), the relational reserve, was developed using Microsoft SQL Server 2005 as the back end. The website is powered by XAMPP (Windows Version 1.7.3). HTML, JavaScript, and CGI-PERL-based web interfaces were employed to execute SQL queries. The curated data and related information were stored in tables. The application layer, the web interface, and the backend relational tables were integrated using CGI-PERL. The overall architecture of hpvPDB is shown in Fig. 1.
