Semantic modeling
We used a semantic tool for knowledge base management, BioXM (Biomax Information AG, Munchen, Germany), which was developed for object-oriented semantic integration. In this approach, semantically identical objects and the associations between them are identified and mapped based on data and descriptive meta-information [10]. This primarily involves the mapping of biological objects and descriptive data from literature to common objects like genes, diseases, or chemical. Associations between entities are mapped as relations (e.g., chemical X is associated with disease A) and object relation information is contextually structured (e.g., gene B is regulated negatively/positively by chemical X). Using objects as nodes and relations as edges, a “semantic network” can be generated that provides information on the connections between participating objects. Various elementary concepts, such as elements, relations, and annotations, are defined in Fig. 1 and the study workflow is illustrated in Fig. 2. We modified this complex semantic network to detect connections, extract patterns, and answer complex questions, as is shown in Fig. 3. To access the data easily, we used the BioXM tool, which provides visual browsing of the knowledge network (Fig. 3), as well as data mapping and query wizards (Fig. 4) that automatically adapt to the changes of a given data model. This system enabled us to create knowledge networks with flexible workflows for handling data and information types.
