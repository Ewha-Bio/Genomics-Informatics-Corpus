Microarray analysis
Parental and radioresistant cells were irradiated with 4 Gy Î³-rays. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and microarray was performed using Affymetrix GeneChip human genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (ITSTech, Seoul, Korea). Data were normalized via global scaling (GenPlex), and genes over the cutoff of 2 were selected based on values of log2 (fold-change): upregulated genes with 'p < 0.05' for detection value were selected in the H460R array, and downregulated genes with 'p < 0.05' for detection value were selected in the H460 array (ITSTech and Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Analysis of significant genes was performed by Welch's t-test. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed between parental and radioresistant cells. Fold-change values in descending order of 200 genes were selected from upregulated genes and downregulated genes. False discovery rate and Bonferroni-corrected p-values were calculated (Macrogen).
