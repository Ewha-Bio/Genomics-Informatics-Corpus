Effects of si-syntrophin beta 2 (SNTB2) on ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis in H460 and H460R cells. (A) SNTB2 expression, relative ratio of SNTB2 proteins, and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in response to IR (4 Gy). After irradiation, Western blot analysis was performed. (B) Effect of SNTB2 knockdown on IR-induced cell viability. After transfection using si-mock or si-SNTB2 siRNA, cells were analyzed by Western blot (upper), and after IR to siRNA-treated cells, cell viability was measured via Trypan Blue exclusion assay (lower). *p < 0.05 vs. si-mock (n = 3). (C) Colony formation assay after IR to siRNA-treated H460 and H460R cells.
