Study of interaction between miRNAs and AGO protein at the molecular level
Strong hydrophobic amino acid residues and amino acids with aromatic rings, which are relatively hydrophobic in nature, generally take part in hydrophobic interactions and contribute towards the stability in binding moieties while the protein interacts with macromolecules. From the inspection of the close amino acid residues of AGO protein surrounding the miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2), some strongly hydrophobic amino acids, like LEU 652, LEU 267, ALA 644, and ALA 648 in mir-145; LEU 267, LEU 277, LEU 279, LEU 281, ALA 278, ALA 648, and VAL 606 in mir-126; LEU 267, LEU 279, LEU 281, and ALA 278in let-7a; ALA 111, VAL 58, and LEU 132 in mir-196b.1; and VAL 549, VAL 152, and ALA 170 in mir-196b.2, were observed within a distance of 3.5 Å (Table 1, Fig. 2A-2E). Similarly, amino acids, like TYR 642, PHE 649, and PHE 647 in mir-145; PHE 649 in mir-126; and TYR 171 and TYR 135 in mir-196b.2, with aromatic rings were also found in the binding pocket of miRNAs (Table 1, Fig. 2A-2E) within a distance of 3.5 Å. The study of hydrogen bonding patterns between atoms is another major parameter to study the stability of interactions between bio-molecules at their atomic level. Some amino acids, like ARG 615, ARG 651, HIS 445, and PHE 649 in mir-145; SER 280, HIS 607, and THR 613 in mir-126; SER 280, ARG 608, GLY 612, LEU 281, and THR 613 in let-7a; ARG 51 and ARG 59 in mir-196b.1; and SER 576, GLY 577, ARG 580, and ARG 615 in mir-196b.2 (Tables 1 and 2, Fig. 3A-3E), were observed to participate in hydrogen bonding with miRNAs within the binding pocket.
