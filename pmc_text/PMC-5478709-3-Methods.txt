SNP genotyping
In this study, we selected three SNPs in non-MHC genes from previous GWASs [4, 5, 1213] that are associated with AS but have not been tested in Koreans: rs11249215 in RUNX3, rs6556416 in IL12B, and rs8070463 in TBKBP1. SNP genotyping was performed using the ViiA7 system (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The thermal cycling program included one cycle at 95℃ for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95℃ for 15 s and 60℃ for 1 min, and a final extension at 60℃ for 30 s. Genotypes were determined using ViiA7 software, version 1.2 (Life Technologies).
