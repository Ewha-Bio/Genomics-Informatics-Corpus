Increased sensitivity to detect causal gene as patient cohort size increases. Percentages shown denote ratio of patients that carry rare functional variants. Simulation was performed assuming that 0.1% of healthy controls carry rare functional variants, and was iterated 105 times. Each iteration was evaluated and called 'detected' if the p-value exceeded the genome-wide significance.
