Clinical characteristics of epilepsy patients
A total of 41 (24%) epileptic patients had ADRs of the CNS, and 127 (76%) epileptic patients did not (non-ADR). The demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1. The gender frequency, drug response, and the average age of drug use between the two groups were similar. (p > 0.05) Subjects without ADRs used fewer drugs than those with ADRs (p = 0.039). The most frequent symptom out of 14 types of ADRs to VPA use was tremors (78.0%). Based on logistic regression, ADRs were more likely to occur in patients with g.-1774delG (presence of G allele), which had the highest OR (9.10) among the considered factors (p < 0.05).
