Phase I
Accession of genome and sequence retrieval
Complete genome sequence of S. flexneri 2a str. 2457T was retrieved from NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) and was found to code for a total of 4,362 proteins (accessed July 5, 2017). Fasta sequences of the complete coding sequence of 682 proteins, characterized as HPs were retrieved from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/). Finally, a total of 674 proteins were retained for downstream analysis following exclusion of duplicates.
Analysis of the conserved domains
Domains are often identified as recurring (sequence or structure) units, and can be thought of as distinct functional and/or structural units of a protein. During molecular evolution, it is assumed that domains may have been utilized as building blocks and have encountered recombination to modulate protein function [23]. A domain or fold might also exhibit a higher degree of conservancy when compared with the entire sequence [24].
In our study, five bioinformatics tools namely: CDD-BLAST (Conserved Domain Database-Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) [25â€“27], PFAM [28], HmmScan [29], SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) [30], and SCANPROSITE [31] were used. These tools are able to search for the defined conserved domains in the targeted protein sequences and further assist in the classification of putative proteins in a particular protein family. HPs analyzed by five aforementioned function prediction web tools revealed the variable results when searched for the conserved domains in hypothetical sequences. Therefore, different confidence levels were assigned on the basis of collective results of these web-tools. One hundred percentage confidence level was considered upon obtaining the same results from the five distinct tools. Finally, we obtained 39 such proteins from 674 primary collected proteins, which were taken for further analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
