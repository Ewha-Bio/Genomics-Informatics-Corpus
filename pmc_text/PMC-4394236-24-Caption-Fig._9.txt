Molecular docking of β-ketoacyl reductase (KR) with its substrate. (A) Substrate β-ketobutyryl is docked to the KR domain. The substrate is shown in ball and stick form, the hydrogen bond is a dotted yellow line, and weak interactions are dotted orange lines. (B) 2D interaction map of β-ketobutyryl substrate to the KR domain. Amino acids are mentioned with 3 letter codes, and arrow indicates hydrogen bonding with Ser2021 and Tyr2034.
