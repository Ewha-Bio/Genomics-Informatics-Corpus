Multi-block dataset
We focused on analyzing a multi-block dataset, considering the characteristics of each block. The multi-block dataset is a data type of horizontally concatenating more than two variable blocks. Usually, each block has different properties and forms and can also be partitioned by prior knowledge, but all blocks have the same number of observations. Suppose there are K blocks, and each block has pk number of variables (k = 1, ···, K). We can express the k-th block Xk as Xk = [x1, ···, xpk]. The total dataset X can be presented as [X1, ···, Xk, ···, XK].
As technology advances, this type of data is common in a variety of studies. For instance, in food science, blocks of variables could be physico-chemical measurements, sensory analysis data, and instrumental measurements [6]. Multiomics, the typical multi-block dataset in the medical field, means a new biological analysis approach where the datasets are multiple omics, such as the genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, and microbiome [7–9]. It usually focuses on associations between SNPs and traits, considering varying phenotypes.
