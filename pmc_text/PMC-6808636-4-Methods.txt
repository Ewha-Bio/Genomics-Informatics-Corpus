Principal component analysis
We conducted principal component analysis (PCA) with PLINK (v1.90b) [10] (--pca) to analyze systematic differences in genome-wide allele frequencies between the two cohorts. PCA is a popular dimensionality reduction technique that can account for population stratification in genetic data [11]. Prior to applying PCA, we used PLINK to prune the SNP data in windows of 50 bps, removing a SNP from each pair of SNPs with an r2 > 0.2. A total of 71,083 SNPs remained after pruning. We extracted the top principal components (PCs) that explained the most variance in the genotype data. The top two and three PCs were used to build two- and three-dimensional PC plots. The top 20 components were used as covariates in the logistic regression for the genome-wide SNPs, as well as in the logistic regression for the HLA binary markers.
