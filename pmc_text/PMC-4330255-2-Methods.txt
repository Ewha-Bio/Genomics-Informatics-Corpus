Phenotype and genotype data
The study subjects are based on the Anseong and Ansan cohort data, part of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) projects. The genotypes and phenotypes of the cohort population are described in Cho et al. [3]. Subjects with genotype accuracies below 98%, high missing genotype call rates (â‰¥4%), high heterozygosity (>30%), or inconsistency in sex were excluded from subsequent analyses. Individuals who had a tumor were excluded, as were related individuals whose estimated identity-by-state values were high (>0.80). After these quality control steps, 352,000 SNP genotypes for 8,842 individuals were selected [4]. The epidemiological trait data for these individuals were also from the KARE project. Among the total of 8,842 individual cases, 368 had hepatitis with age over 30, and 1,500 controls were randomly selected from non-hepatitis individuals with age over 30. Table 2 summarizes the clinical characteristics of the phenotypes in this study.
The chosen dataset was imbalanced; the number of cases was smaller than controls. A dataset is imbalanced if it contains many more samples from one class than from the rest of the classes [5]. In this case, the classification analysis showed good accuracy in the majority class but very poor accuracy in the minority class. Therefore, we needed to transform the imbalanced dataset to a balanced dataset. We applied an 'oversampling' scheme [5] to overcome the imbalance problem. The final dataset contained 1,500 controls and 1,500 cases.
