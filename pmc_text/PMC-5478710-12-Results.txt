Signature sequences in the target group
In total, 1,527 fragments representing 3.0% of the E. coli 53638-strain genome were identified as signature sequences. Biomarkers were restricted to 21 highly significant regions, designated A to U. When E. coli IHE3034 was set as the reference strain, 220 signature sequences (0.4%) were detected. Biomarkers were identified in six regions, designated A to F. However, 1,512 (2.9%) signature fragments were obtained, which were restricted to 18 regions (A to R) in the genome of E. coli RN587/1 when it was regarded as the reference strain. Moreover, 620 biomarker fragments (1.2%) were detected in the genome of E. coli STEC B2F1 when it was set as the reference strain, 16 biomarker regions (A to P) were recognized. In addition, when E. coli STEC C165-02 was used as the reference strain, 593 signature fragments (1.1%) were identified, which were restricted to eight regions (A to H). The signature regions for all reference strains are shown in Fig. 3, separately. In addition, the biomarker designation, domain description, BLASTX results and related putative conserved domains for each reference strain are provided in Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
