We have reviewed above that natural variation in gene expression is substantial and heritable. Genetic analyses of expression phenotypes have identified cis- and trans-associated loci, culminating in our understanding of gene expression regulation. One should understand that not all genes showing natural variation are regulated by either cis- or trans-eQTLs. For example, genes downstream of eQTL-regulated genes in a regulatory network may also show natural variation. If they are regulated primarily by a regulator, their expression profile may resemble that of the regulator. On the other hand, if multiple regulators are involved, the downstream target genes may show complex expression profiles that may look independent of those of the regulators. Integrating the bioinformatic learning of regulatory programs and genetic analysis of cis- and trans-acting DNA variants may lead to a better understanding of gene expression regulation [27]. Nayak et al. [28] constructed co-expression networks based on the HapMap expression profiles of African, European, and Asian ancestries, discovering that the subnetwork structures are not random but relevant to biological pathways or disease susceptibility. This implies that genes are regulated by a common set of regulatory modules and that the variable activity of the modules due to genetic variation can result in clustered expression profiles of the target genes. Li et al. [9], using 32 recombinant inbred mouse strains, reported 29 transcription modules and their associations with 18 classical physiological and behavioral traits, possibly through eQTLs.
