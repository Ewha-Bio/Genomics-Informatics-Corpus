Genotype comparison of samples
The multi-sample SNP genotyping was performed with UnifiedGenotyper to compare the genotypes on the variant positions where all samples were able to be genotyped. The filtration scheme was the same as above. The distance between two samples was calculated as the sum of genotype difference values (0 if two genotypes are same, 1 if a genotype is 0/1 and another is 0/0 or 1/1, 2 if a genotype is 0/0 and another is 1/1). The distances were divided by the number of the variant positions. Heatmap and similarity matrix were used to visualize the distances.
