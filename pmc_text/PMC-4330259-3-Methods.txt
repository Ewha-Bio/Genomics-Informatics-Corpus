Data collection
Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect a personal history of cigarette smoking (never smoked, ex-smoker, or current smoker) and demographic characteristics (age, gender, etc.). Waist circumference was measured midway between the lower rib and iliac crest. For measurements of weight and height, light clothing was worn. Body mass indices were calculated as the subject's weight (kg) divided by the square of the subject's height (m2).
For clinical chemistry assays, serum was separated from peripheral venous blood samples obtained from each participant after a 12-hour fast and stored at -70â„ƒ. Biomarkers of metabolic syndrome, including fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and uric acid levels were measured. Quality control of the data was conducted in accordance with the procedures recommended by the Korean Association of Laboratory Quality Control.
