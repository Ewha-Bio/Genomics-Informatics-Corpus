Distribution of DNA methylation profiles. Hierarchical clustering was performed using the expression of genes (A) and the DNA methylation patterns (B) in obese (Obese 1–6) and control individuals (Normal 1–6). (C) The distribution of beta-values is shown across 12 individuals (red and blue for obese and control individuals, respectively). Left and right insets are magnified as views of peaks representing hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG sites, respectively. (D) The distribution of M-values represented in a similar manner to that shown in panel C. (E) Boxplot of hypomethylated CpG sites shown across 12 individuals. The cases are sorted in order of the median of M-values. (F) Hypermethylated CpG sites are represented in a similar manner to that shown in panel E.
