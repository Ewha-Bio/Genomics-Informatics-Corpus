Processing of human chromatin accessibility data
DNase-seq data for 70 YRI lymphoblastoid cell lines [8] were downloaded from http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/dsQTL_data/MAPPED_READS/. Sequence reads from multiple replicates for each sample were combined and F-Seq [17] was run to identify the peaks of the reads from each sample. Statistical significance of the peak was determined by fitting the data to a gamma distribution to obtain the p-value (script obtained from the F-Seq authors). p < 10-3 was used to identify significant peaks from each sample. The overlapping peaks across the YRI individuals were merged into a single peak by using the mergeBED command of BEDTools [18], resulting in a total of 265,130 accessible chromatin regions. For each sample, the number of the DNase-seq reads mapped to each region was counted and the read count was normalized as previously suggested [1920] to obtain normalized chromatin accessibility, which was then further normalized to zero mean and unit variance across the YRI samples. Accessible regions falling on promoters or enhancers were identified based on chromatin annotation by Ernst et al. [21]. A total of 45,781 chromatin regions were found to reside in active promoters, weak promoters, poised promoters, strong enhancers, and weak enhancers annotated in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line.
