The results of the GCCA were analyzed separately according to each group. In doing the GCCA, we needed to determine how many canonical variables we would have. The generalized canonical correlation results are presented in Table 3. Group 1 had generalized canonical correlations of 0.183, 0.156, and 0.095. The square of the generalized canonical correlations was 0.034, 0.024, and 0.009. The square of the generalized canonical correlation was used for calculating what proportion the canonical variable explains the dataset. For instance, the first canonical variable in group 1 had a square of the generalized canonical correlation value of 0.034 (rounded number is listed in Table 4). The proportion was calculated by using the square of the generalized canonical correlation. The first GCCA canonical variable explained 50.2% of the variation, while the second and third variables explained 36.4% and 13.4%, respectively. Therefore, for group 1, we used two canonical variables that were sufficient enough to represent the dataset. The other three groups also required two canonical variables to represent the dataset.Since we have three blocks, we could make three initial canonical variables. The SNP block’s first canonical variable was U1 = a1SNP1 + ··· + a35SNP35. The phenotype block’s first canonical variable was V1 = b1SUP + b2SUB + b3BMI + b4WHR + b5WAIST. The disease block’s first canonical variable was W1 = c1Diabete + c2Hyper. The term ai, bi, ci represents the coefficient of each i-th variable in the block. When we draw the first canonical variables U1 , V1 , W1 and the second variables U2, V2, W2, we can interpret the relationship of each block’s variable to the other block. In this paper, we first explain the relationship between blocks and then discuss the relationship within the blocks.
