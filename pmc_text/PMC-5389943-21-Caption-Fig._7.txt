Functional enrichment analysis. It identifies predominant biological themes among the nearest genes by incorporating biological knowledge provided by biological ontologies. It shows results in the gene region from â€“1000 to +1000 of the transcription start site. The top 3 circles in the figure have p-values of 1.837e-32, 1.970e-29, and 6.854e-21, respectively.
