Structure preparation of AGO protein
The three-dimensional crystallized structure of AGO protein, with 685 amino acid residues was extracted from Protein Data bank (PDB ID: 3F73). The structure of AGO protein contains guide DNA and target RNA duplexes. All water molecules and ligands were removed from the structure. As, the AGO protein is a homo dimer, out of two chains, only chain 'A' of AGO protein was considered and refined before docking. The necessary correction in bond order and bond length of all atoms in the structure was performed using prepare protein and clean geometry protocol of Discovery Studio 3.5.
