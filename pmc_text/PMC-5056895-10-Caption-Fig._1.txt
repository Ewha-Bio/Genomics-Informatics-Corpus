(A) Three-dimensional structure of predicted nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein model of Zika virus (ZIKV). (B) Ramachandran plot of predicted NS3 model. (C) ProSA-web Z-scores of all protein chains in Protein Data Bank determined by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with respect to their length. The Z-score of NS3 was present in that range represented in dot. (D) Energy plot for the predicted NS3 protein of ZIKV. (E) ERRAT plot for residue-wise analysis of homology model. aOn the error axis, two lines are drawn to indicate the confidence with which it is possible to reject regions that exceed that error value.
