Enrichment of the affected genes in the known gene set
We downloaded DM-, HT-, and CAD-related gene information from Phenopedia (HuGE Navigator, version 2.0) [12]. The HuGE Navigator is an integrated knowledge-based database of genetic associations that have been extensively explored, based on the literature, and is continuously updated from PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/).
To test whether the genes we discovered were statistically enriched within known genes involving the disease, we calculated the p-value using the hyper-geometric test: where N represents the total number of genes (N = 20,242), n is the number of genes we found, and M and k are the number of genes in the known DB (Table 3) and that overlap, respectively.
