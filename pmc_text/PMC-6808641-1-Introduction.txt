Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has had a major impact on the field of genomics since its first release in 2005 [1]. Since then, many different NGS platforms have been developed, adopting different strategies and chemical techniques [1]. However, NGS machines based on Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis method have dominated the sequencing market owing to their high accuracy and high throughput. The NovaSeq 6000, the latest instrument of Illumina’s series, now generates 6 TB of sequence data in a single run with a running cost of 12-18 USD/GB.
Recently, MGI Tech, a subsidiary of the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) Group, launched a series of new NGS machines (the BGI-200, BGI-500, MGISEQ-2000, and MGISEQ-T7) based on DNA nanoball technology; these devices promise to deliver high-quality sequencing data faster at lower prices. For example, the MGISEQ-2000 currently generates 1.44 TB of sequence data in a single run with a running cost of 10 USD/GB. Several recent studies have compared the performance of BGI sequencers with Illumina’s sequencers and showed that the BGI sequencers produced high-quality sequence data at lower or similar prices in studies of whole-exome [2,3], whole-genome [4][1], transcriptome [5,6], single-cell transcriptome [2,78], metagenome [9], and small RNA sequencing [10].
In this study, we compared the performance of MGISEQ-2000 with that of Illumina’s HiSeq 4000 by sequencing the same RNAs from four human colorectal cancer patients’ tissue samples. We found that the MGISEQ-2000 produced high-quality sequence data comparable to the data obtained by the HiSeq 4000, at half the price. We suggest that the MGISEQ-2000 is a promising sequencing platform for whole-transcriptomics studies with high performance and low cost.
