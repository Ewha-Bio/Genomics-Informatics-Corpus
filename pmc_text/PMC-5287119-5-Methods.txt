Review of BOOST
The logistic regression model with only a main effect for two SNPs, p and q, can be modeled by the following form: logP(Y=1|Xp=i,Xp=j)P(Y=2|Xp=i,Xp=j)=β0+βiχp+βjχq, and denote its log-likelihood as LM. The logistic regression model with main effects and interaction terms is logP(Y=1|Xp=i,Xq=j)P(Y=2|Xp=i,Xq=j)=β0+βiXp+βjχq+βijχpχq.
We denote it log-likelihood value by LF. Then, the interaction effects can be detected by the difference of the maximum log-likelihoods (MLEs) of these two models—i.e., L^F-L^M.
However, the difference in the log-likelihood needs very intensive computation for hundreds of billions of pairs of SNPs. Alternatively, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between a logistic regression model and a log-linear model in categorical data analysis [15], and BOOST considers interaction models based on log-linear models [9].
On the basis of the equivalence between the log-linear model and its corresponding logistic regression model, BOOST constructed its test statistic using the homogeneous association model MH and saturated model MS and denotes their log-likelihood as LH and LS, respectively. Then, we denote the observed genotype count of disease status k with Xp = i and Xq = j by nijk and the expected genotype count by µijk, where k = 1 or 2, i = 1, 2, or 3, and j = 1, 2, or 3. Then, the maximum log-likelihood of both models will be L^S=∑i,j,knijklognijk-nijk-lognijk!.
If we let μ^ijkH be the MLE of µijk for MH, we have L^H=LHμ^ijkH=maxμijk∑i,j,knijklogμijk-μijk-lognijk!.
The interaction effects based on the likelihood ratio test can be calculated by the following forms: L^S-L^H=∑i,j,knijklognijkμ^ijkH-nijk+μ^ijkH.
If we let n be the total sample size, π^ijk=nijkn and P^ijk=μ^ijkHn, it can be further simplified as n∑i,j,kπ^ijklogπ^ijkP^ijk, and it can also be denoted by Kullback-Leibler's [9] form as n·DKLπ^ijk‖P^ijk.
This provides another interpretation of interactions, in that the difference of two log-likelihoods is proportional to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the joint distribution obtained under the saturated model MS and the distribution obtained under homogeneous association model MH.
In particular, there is no closed form solution for homogenous association model MH, and iterative methods are needed to calculate the likelihood ratio tests. Likelihood ratio tests are computationally intensive when facing hundreds of billions of SNP pairs in the interaction analysis.
To address this issue, BOOST uses Kirkwood superposition approximation (KSA) [16] to estimate under MH as p^ijkK=1ηπij.πi.kπ.jkπi..π.j.π..k,where η=∑i,j,kπij.πi.kπ.jkπi..π.j.π..k.
Therefore, it can be utilized to approximate LH. If we let LKSA be the likelihood based on KSA, then we get following equation: 2L^S-L^KSA=2n·DKLπ^ijk‖p^ijkK, and it can be calculated easily on the basis of the contingency table. Through simulation analysis by Wan et al. [9], 2L^S-L^KSA is known to be an upper bound of 2L^S-L^H, and they are almost identical if they are larger than 25. The default value of the threshold τ in BOOST is 30, and its corresponding p-value is 4.89 × 10−6 [9].
In the screening stage of BOOST, all pairwise interactions will be evaluated by using KSA. If 2L^S-L^KSA>τ, the interaction will be considered in the next testing stage; otherwise, it will be discarded from the analyses. All of the non-significant SNP pairs would be filtered out in this manner in the screening stage.
