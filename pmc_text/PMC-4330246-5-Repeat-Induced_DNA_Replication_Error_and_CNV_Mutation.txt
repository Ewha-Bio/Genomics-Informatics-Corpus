As discussed above, repeat-mediated NAHR is one of the major mutational mechanisms for CNV formations. In these recombination-based events, paired repeats in direct orientation contribute to CNV instability and disease traits. However, is it the only way for the genomic repeats to induce CNV mutations? The recent investigation of DNA replication-based mechanisms provides novel insights into repeat-mediated CNV instability.
