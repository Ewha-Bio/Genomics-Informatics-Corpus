Selection of graph database engine
Among the many graph databases available, we chose Neo4j, an open-source graph database based on Java, for our primary graph database, owing to several advantages. Its major advantages include (1) the use of a graph model of relationships for intuitive information searches; (2) stability by providing full ACID (Access, Create, Insert, Delete) transaction; (3) flexible extension above billions of nodes, relationships, and properties; (4) use of Java, which is easy to maintain and is applicable to diverse operating systems (OSs); and (5) easy-to-use API based on the REST interface and Java API [15].
