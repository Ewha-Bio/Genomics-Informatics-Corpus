Illustration of molecular pathway for significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in the metabolic syndrome genome-wide association study (GWAS). The molecules depicted by the significant GWAS loci (reds), functional SNPs (expression quantitative trait loci or nonsynonymous SNPs) loci (green), and the other intermediate molecules (yellow) are illustrated on the cell organelles.
