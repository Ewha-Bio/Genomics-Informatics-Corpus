Other proteins
Six HPs have been predicted to exhibit miscellaneous functions where most of them are protein with unknown function. Among them, WP_001382892.1 and WP_000691930.1 have been preicted to be domains of unknown function and are found in a number of bacterial proteins. WP_001125713.1 has been found to be YcgL domain with conserved class of small proteins widespread in gammaproteo bacteria. This group of proteins contain a 85-residue domain of unknown function and two alpha-helices and four beta-strands in the sequential arrangement [88]. We have also predicted WP_001237866.1 and WP_005049020.1 as YecR and YehR like family of lipoproteins found in bacteria and viruses and are functionally uncharacterized.
