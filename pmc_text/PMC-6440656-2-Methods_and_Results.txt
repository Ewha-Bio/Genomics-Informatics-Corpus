To detect k-order interactions, MDR compares the balanced accuracy of all possible k-SNP combinations [3] and performs cross-validations. In fuzzy-MDR [15], fuzzy membership functions are used for reflecting the uncertainty of “high risk” or “low risk,” and validation of this uncertainty has been confirmed in various simulation experiments. In EFMDR [17], the maximum likelihood estimator of probabilities of “case” or “control” is used as the relative membership degree of “high risk” and “low risk,”. In addition, it is proven that the fuzzy balanced accuracy of EFMDR follows a chi-square distribution and that the cross-validation scheme is omitted by this property [17]. Because of the omission of cross-validation and the simple membership function, EFMDR is faster than fuzzy-MDR, but it is still slow in detecting high-order interactions.
For fast execution of EFMDR written in R, such optimization methods as using vector calculations might be a good approach. Instead, we used the RCPP package [18] for the implementation of faster EFMDR. In EFMDR, for detecting the k-locus interaction of a p-SNP dataset, (pk) SNP combinations are tested for the detection of an SNP combination with the highest fuzzy balanced accuracy. For example, for the detection of two-locus interactions in a 1000-SNP dataset, 1000*999/2=499,500 combinations are tested. This procedure—comparing fuzzy balanced accuracy values of all possible k-SNP combinations—dominates almost the total execution time. Therefore, we implemented a function for comparisons of balanced accuracy values of all possible k-SNP combinations using RCPP package (EFMDR-Fast).
The results of the execution of EFMDR and EFMDR-Fast are in exactly the same formats. Hence, the results of EFMDR-Fast can be visualized easily using functions in EFMDR, as shown in Fig. 1.
We confirmed that the best SNP combinations of EFMDR and EFMDR-Fast are exactly the same. EFMDR-Fast is about 800 times faster than EFMDR. These comparisons were performed in R, version 3.5.1 on the Windows 10 platform with a 3.20 GHz CPU and 16 GB RAM. The program source codes and examples of EFMDR-Fast, written in R, and RCPP are available at http://statgen.snu.ac.kr/software/efmdr.
