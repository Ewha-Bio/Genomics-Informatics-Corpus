Plant material, RNA extraction, and library preparation
C. japonicum was obtained from the National Institute of Biological Resources, Korea. The flower, leaf, and root tissues were immediately dissected and grinded in liquid nitrogen for the RNA extraction. The total RNA was extracted using Hybrid-R (Geneall, PN: 3033522) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The total RNA was further treated with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) and purified on an RNA-purification column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) to eliminate possible gnomic contamination. The RNA quality was evaluated using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and RNA samples with RNA integrity number values above eight were used for the subsequent cDNA synthesis. The DNA was sheared with an average of 500 bp fragment sizes. The TruSeq Library Preparation Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to construct the DNA library according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA libraries were sequenced with 150-bp paired-end sequencing using an Illumina Hiseq2500. The quality of the constructed libraries was confirmed by a LabChip GX system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
