Statistical analysis
As we only had genotype data from a small number (n = 11) of fulminant T1DM cases, we tried to describe the HLA genotype and haplotype of each individual, as well as the recently reported amino acid residues at three major positions in the HLA-DR and HLA-DQ molecules [5]. For the case-control analysis, 11 fulminant T1DM cases and 413 Korean Reference Panel controls were compared [6]. Subject having two copies of a specific variant was classified as Present/Present, having only one copy was defined as Present/Absent, and having none of the variants was considered Absent/Absent. Fisher's exact test was performed to compare the frequency of HLA haplotype or variant in each locus and Cochran-Armitage trend test was performed to examine the linear trend of three types, Present/Present, Present/Absent, and Absent/Absent between cases and controls. A p-value of less than 0.05 was regarded to be statistically significant. Assuming a type 1 error rate of 0.05 and a variant frequency of 0.27 in 11 cases and 0.08 in 413 controls, our study had a limited statistical power of 0.43 using Fisher's exact text.
