The sQTLs and trait-associated SNPs
Here, we interpreted the molecular mechanism of previously published trait-associated SNPs into sQTLs. The published trait-associated SNPs were downloaded from the 107 phenotypes database [3]. This database includes 107 phenotypes of 4 categories. We looked for the sQTLs that overlapped with SNPs in the database resource and selected SNPs having a significant association with phenotypes. As a result, we found 96 candidate sQTLs that were able to explain the mechanism of trait-associated SNPs. Among the 96 candidate sQTLs, we finally selected 25 sQTLs affecting high differential expression of an alternatively spliced target exon across genotypes. We show an example of a trait-associated sQTL in Fig. 2. The SNP, which resides in chr3:20,536,243, affects the ninth exon of AT3G55400, OVA1. That is, the expression ratio of the exon with the alternative 3â€² splice site is higher in the heterozygote (AG) than in the homozygote (GG). OVA1 encodes a methionine-tRNA ligase and has an association with ovule development, and its polymorphism was reported to be associated with the pedicel [3]. We report the full list of trait-associated sQTLs in Table 1.
