Gene expression patterns of 76 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Hierarchical cluster analysis was done between six stable cell lines using 76 DEGs. Normalized log2-gene expression values were analyzed by Cluster 3.0, and the results were visualized using Java Treeview, with red being high and green indicating low.
