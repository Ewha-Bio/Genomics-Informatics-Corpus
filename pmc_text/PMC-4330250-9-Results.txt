Distribution of haplotype blocks
We calculated the average space between alleles in a haplotype block from our results. For example, AK4, AK5, and AK7 share CGCC at bps 182065282, 182065314, 182065341, and 182065351 in chromosome 4 (Table 2). The haplotype block ranges from bp 182065282 through bp 182065351; the length of the haplotype is 69 bp. Since there are four SNPs, the average space is about 17. We plotted the distribution of the average spaces between SNPs within a haplotype (Fig. 2). The number of alleles found for a haplotype is also plotted in Fig. 2.
