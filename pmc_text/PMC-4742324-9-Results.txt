SNP effects for population-specific genes
To understand how SNPs related positive selection affect protein function, we analyzed SNP effects using the SNPeffect database. We identified two genes, SLA-DQA1 and EPHX1, with nsSNPs showing evidence of positive selection in D-Y, respectively (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). To obtain accurate results, Fisher's exact test was performed on these two genes. The total numbers of statistical tests performed on the non-synonymous genes were 20 × 3 × 13 (number of cases of amino acids × number of breeds × number of non-synonymous amino acid positions) for SLA-DQA1, and 20 × 3 × 4 for EPHX1. From the enrichment tests, we identified three positions (rs324509622, rs80931851, and rs80937718) that were significant under a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value of <0.05 with an alternative hypothesis: the odds ratio is greater than 1 in the SLA-DQA1 gene. The p-values of the three non-synonymous positions were 5.20e-05, 5.20e-05, and 7.43e-06, respectively. As a note, the above three significant enrichment results were observed only in the Duroc breed. The non-synonymous positions showed strong evidence for positive selection between D-Y based on the XPEHH test. As the result, we validated the Duroc-specific enrichment of amino acids affected by non-synonymous SNPs using statistical tests. This result will contribute to improving the meat quality of pigs.
