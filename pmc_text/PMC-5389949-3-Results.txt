Data manipulation
TRAPR provides two functions to import RNA-Seq experimental data and four functions to export results to files. TRAPR can read text files for expression data as well as for a list of genes. During or following analysis, users can export DEG lists or detailed tables for DEG and expression tables, which other tools can utilize.
