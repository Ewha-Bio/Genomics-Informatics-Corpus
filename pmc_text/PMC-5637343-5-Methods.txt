Next-generation sequencing‒based copy number variation analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from cell pellets and frozen patient bone marrow samples using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of DNA was measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA), and bone marrow samples were stored at ‒80°C until further use.
Shearing was performed using the M220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) (peak power, 55 W; duty factor, 20; cycle/burst, 200; time, 3 min). The library prep was then used with the Accel-NGS2S Plus Library kit (Swift Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) sequencing was performed in the 75-bp single-end mode of a NextSeq500 instrument. The human reference (hg19) was aligned with the BWA-mem 0.7.5a version. PCR deduplication with Picard (ver. 1.96) was conducted, and only the reads with a mapping quality of 60 were selected. GC content and mappability correction were performed using Q-seq (v.1.8.0) R-packaged and high-order artifacts were removed using the principal component analysis method. The reference samples included data on 20 females that were confirmed to be normal and were used for the array results. Data segmentation was performed using the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm and DNA copy (v.1.38.1).
After alignment, the sequence read was counted in chromosome units and compared with the control set to obtain the z-score, which determined whether or not aneuploidy was present at the chromosome level. In order to determine the presence of a microdeletion or duplication, the human genome reference sequence was further divided into several 10,000-segment bins, and the number of sequence readings aligned in the bin was counted and compared with the control set to obtain the z-score.
