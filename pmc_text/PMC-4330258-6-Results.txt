Characteristics of the study participants, including age, sex, and trait summaries, are presented in Table 1. Quantile-quantile analysis of 2-d.f. logistic regression statistics for the comparison of genotype frequencies in the cohorts confirmed the genetic homogeneity of these two components of the KARE study population (Fig. 1). We observed significant SNPs by applying a Bonferroni adjustment cut-off with a combined p-value < 1.0 × 10-7. The GWAS identified several genomic locations as potentially associated with platelet count (Fig. 2). In a follow-up examination of the Health2 cohort, we examined 7,861 selected from 8,500 participants (aged, 40 to 69 years). We confirmed 3 replicated signals, of which 3 signals, replicating previously documented reports, and one novel locus were discovered.
We observed 3 independent signals with p < 10-5 for platelet counts. Table 2 and Fig. 3 show results for three regions that had combined genomewide significant evidence for association with platelet count in the KARE GWAS and replication samples. For platelet counts, the strongest evidence for association was at 12q24 (rs739496, MAF = 0.11, combined p = 1.15 × 10-15) (Table 2, Fig. 3B). The associated signal is concordant with a previously published result in the Japanese population [6]. This SNP is located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SH2B adaptor protein 3 (also known as LNK). SH2B3 is a member of the APS family of adaptor proteins, which play a pivotal role as broad inhibitors of growth factors and cytokine signaling pathways. The second SNP, rs3733606 (MAF = 0.50, combined p = 1.46 × 10-10) (Table 2, Fig. 3A) in 4p16, is in the 3' UTR of the KIAA0232 gene, which translates the functionally unknown hypothetical protein LOC9778. The third locus associated with platelet is at 6p21 (rs9296095, MAF = 0.23, combined p = 1.67 × 10-7) (Table 2, Fig. 3C).
