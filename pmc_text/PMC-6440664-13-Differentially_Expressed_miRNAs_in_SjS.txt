T and B lymphocytes
Dysregulated miRNA expression in purified T and B lymphocytes from patients with pSjS was reported this year [25]. The authors purified CD4＋ T cells and CD19＋ B cells from PBMC of two independent cohorts. Cohorts of pSjS and HC for discovery (n = 17 and n = 15, respectively) and another cohort for replication (27 for T cells and 25 for B cells for pSjS and 12 HC, respectively) were included in the study. The Exiqon system containing 372 miRNAs was utilized. In T lymphocytes, the study showed upregulation of haslet-7d-3p, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-378a-3p and hsa-miR-28–5 p in both the discovery and the replication cohorts. In B lymphocytes, hsa-miR-378a-3p, hsa-miR-222-3p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-30b-5p, and hsa-miR-19b-3p were significantly differentially expressed. Interestingly, expression of BAFF mRNA was inversely correlated with the down-regulated expression of hsa-miR-30b-5p in B cells from SjS patients. Furthermore, transfection of THP-1 cells with an antagomir (miRNA inhibitor) for hsa-miR-30b-5p led to a strong increase in BAFF expression, providing strong evidence that the loss of hsa-miR30b-5p could contribute to the increased expression of BAFF in patients with pSjS [25].
