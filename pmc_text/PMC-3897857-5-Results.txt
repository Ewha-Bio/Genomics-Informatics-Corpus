Previously, we found a dozen mRNA markers and developed multiplex qRT-PCR probes for body fluid identification [16]. But, most of the markers, except pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), were not perfect in terms of area under the curve (AUC) value (AUC, 1). To improve the accuracy of identification, we considered a multiplexed assay using multiple probes for each body fluid. While the multiplex qRT-PCR system is limited by the number of available dyes in a reaction, the NanoString nCounter can measure the expression of hundreds of RNAs at once [18]. So, we adopted the NanoString nCounter as the multiplexed identification method using multiple RNA markers for each body fluid.
After designing NanoString probes for 18 mRNA markers (four to five for each body fluid and two for controls), we performed NanoString nCounter assays with a total of 12 RNA samples for each body fluid. As a result, we got a dozen good probes (Fig. 1) according to the following criteria: 1) p < 0.005 and 2) body fluid-specific expression pattern. Results of the other probes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. To test the value of each marker as a body fluid-specific marker, we performed ROC analysis (Fig. 2). For blood- or semen-specific markers, the identification accuracy was perfect (AUC, 1). But, for saliva and vaginal secretion, no single marker showed perfect accuracy (Fig. 2).
To improve the accuracy of saliva and vaginal secretion identification, we tried a combination of markers using logistic regression analysis [22]. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of each marker and then evaluated the performance of the combined markers (Fig. 3). For saliva and vaginal identification, using two markers significantly improved the identification accuracy (Table 1). Therefore, we could identify each body fluid with multiple makers for each body fluid using the NanoString nCounter quite accurately.
