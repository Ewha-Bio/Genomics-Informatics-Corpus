Systemic lupus erythematosus
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) miRNA profiles in SLE (n = 8) were compared with those of pSjS (n = 8) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 7) by the Illumina next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) [10]. A total of 135 miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in SLE compared to only 26 miRNAs in pSjS. Of 26 miRNAs differentially-expressed in pSjS, 25 miRNAs were also commonly overexpressed in SLE as well. Downregulation of miR-150-5p was only detected in pSjS, which appears to be associated with differential ratios of B cells in comparison with SLE [11]. Several miRNA molecules were overexpressed in SLE, but not changed in pSjS, which include miR-148a-3p, miR-152, miR-155, miR-223, miR-224, miR-326, and miR-342. Interestingly, expression levels of miR-223-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-342-3p were associated with the B cell subsets, such as native B cells or switched memory B cells in the PBMC samples. As B cell hyperactivity is characteristic in both pSjS and SLE, the miRNA expression signature may serve to dissect the pathological B cell regulation between those two conditions.
