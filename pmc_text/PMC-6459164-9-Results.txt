DEGs and biologically relevant subnetworks
DEGs—80 up-regulated genes and 757 down-regulated genes in COPD—could be 10 identified by applying the following conditions: genes with absolute fold-change over 1.25 and p-values less than 0.01 (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table 1). Of them, 66 (82.5%) up-regulated genes and 501 (66.2%) down-regulated genes overlapped with the 1,420 genes previously identified by Kim et al. [10]. However, PCA of the DEGs showed a clear difference between COPD samples and normal samples (Fig. 3B). These DEGs might explain the variability between samples better than the previously identified DEGs (PC1, 0.702; PC2, 0.031; and PC3, 0.018). Accordingly, the performance of the prediction model with DEGs (AUC) increased from 0.793 to 0.931.
To detect biological functions or pathways closely related to specific genes, we performed enrichment assays with DEGs (Fig. 3C and 3D). A relatively small number of up-regulated genes in COPD were related to several functions, such as smooth muscle cell proliferation, protein autophosphorylation, and wound healing, as previously shown. On the other hand, down-regulated genes were associated with translational elongation, antigen processing and presentation, and oxidative phosphorylation coupled with electron transport in mitochondria. Additionally, in terms of biological pathways, down-regulated genes were linked to the ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, the proteasome, and a couple of neurodegenerative disorders.
The identification of protein interaction subnetworks using the transcriptome can provide useful information on interaction modules for specific functions. Reliable subnetworks were constructed by PhenomeExpress in combination with gene expression profiles and disease-related phenotypes [18]. There were five meaningful subnetworks significantly enriched with specific functions (Fig. 4A-4D). The largest subnetwork was too complex to interpret (Supplementary Fig. 3), and it was further divided into three subnetworks (Fig. 4E-4G). Functions, such as electron transport chain and translation elongation, were detected in 11 subnetworks, as with DEGs. In contrast, functions related to the regulation of transcription, vesicle-mediated transport, regulation of apoptosis, and immune system processes, were only observed in subnetworks. Whereas the term ‘general antigen presenting and presentation’ was enriched in DEGs, their function was confined to MHC class II in a subnetwork.
