In this study, dictionaries for assigning MeSH information to Japanese medical terms was investigated. Although there are limited numbers of Japanese-English dictionaries that assign MeSH IDs (i.e., tree numbers) to Japanese terms, using them for NLP applications is not simple, due to license restrictions. An alternative approach, using open-source resources, was attempted, and yielded a partial success. Using other open resources, and qualitative evaluation of our results, will be the subject of future work.
