There are several online resources in Japan which have MeSH information. Unfortunately, none are fully open for NLP. For example, the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi Thesaurus (https://www.jamas.or.jp/database/thesaurus.html), created by JAMAS, organizes Japanese medical terms, based on MeSH tree structures. The latest version (version 9), released in 2019, is freely available for searching and browsing, without registration, but is not downloadable. This thesaurus is based on MeSH 2018, but is not its direct translation. It has 28,247 of 28,939 MeSH 2018 descriptors, and 3,513 terms outside the original MeSH, such as names of drugs sold in Japan and names of Japanese locations and institutions. The terms excluded from MeSH 2018 mainly consist of the names of foreign locations and institutions. The previous version (version 8), released in 2015, was based on MeSH 2014, and claimed to be the Japanese MeSH included in the UMLS. However, while the data download is not free, and the price is not made public.
The Japanese Association of Medical Sciences (JAMS, Nihon Igakkai) provides an English-Japanese/Japanese-English medical dictionary online (http://jams.med.or.jp/dic/mdic.html), to registered users, for searching. Download of data, however, is not available. The latest version of the online dictionary (November 2016) has 71,067 Japanese terms and 70,103 English terms, corresponding to 50,088 concepts. The terms in MeSH (and their translation to Japanese) are marked as such, and the top of the MeSH tree numbers (e.g., C14 for abdominal aortic aneurysm, whose tree numbers are C14.907.055.239.075 and C14.907.109.139.075) are provided. This MeSH coding is based on MeSH 2014.
The Life Science Dictionary (https://lsd-project.jp/cgi-bin/lsdproj/ejlookup04.pl) [2] is developed and regularly updated at Kyoto University. The dictionary actually consists of three mutually linked components: the English-Japanese/Japanese-English dictionary, the thesaurus, and the corpus. The English-Japanese/Japanese-English dictionary has 117,857 English terms and 132,100 Japanese terms. The entries have been assigned ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases, version 10) codes, and a link to the thesaurus, where applicable. The thesaurus is a subset of English terms in the dictionary which have corresponding entries in MeSH (the current thesaurus is based on MeSH 2018), organized in the MeSH hierarchy, with synonyms both in English and Japanese, and related terms, based on co-ocurrences in PubMed abstracts. The corpus is a KWIC (keyword in context) of English terms in PubMed articles, generated on-demand. The dictionary, the thesaurus, and the corpus can all be searched freely, without registration, but downloading them requires an extra license agreement. In addition, the Life Science Dictionary converted to a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format is maintained by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS, http://lsd.dbcls.jp/portal/), available under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/).
The Interlinking Ontology for Biological Concepts (IOBC) [3] is a derivative of the JST-thesaurus (i.e., the thesaurus for indexing general science and technology publications used by the Japan Science and Technology Agency [JST]). This derivative was developed by the National Bioscience Database Center of JST, and is available from the NCBO BioPortal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/IOBC) under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial 4.0 International license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). This IOBC has 153,160 concepts, from the life sciences and related categories (such as chemistry), from the JST thesaurus 2015 version, written in both English and Japanese. Among them, 12,780 concepts also have corresponding MeSH UIDs. However, the MeSH information in the IOBC has not been updated from the one in the JST thesaurus 2015 version. The JST thesaurus itself is updated, and can be freely searched via web interface, although data download is not allowed. The JST also has the RDF version of the thesaurus, and its SPARQL endpoint was available to registered users of the service “J-Global Knowledge,” which unfortunately, has been discontinued.
Of these dictionaries, the JAMAS Thesaurus, JAMS Dictionary, and Life Science Dictionary are targeted to readers to seek information on already known terms, but cannot be searched by applications (such as morphological analysis), where the systems must find unspecified terms, over a broader context. Since creating derivatives of these dictionaries is not allowed for free, adapting them for NLP processes (such as morphological analysis), and especially making the results open, is very difficult. The IOBC does allow creation of derivatives, but only for non-commercial purposes, and its MeSH information is not updated, at least in the current version.
