In Caliciviridae, all genera have RNA helicase in common as Fig. 3. In addition, RNA helicase exists in the type of single-strain RNA in common. As we know, RNA helicases have important roles in viral life cycles as well as in all cellular processes involving RNA. Vertebrate RNA helicases detects viral infections and causes the innate antiviral immune response. RNA helicases have been related with protozoic, bacterial and fungal infections such as neurological disorders, cancer, and aging processes. Thus, they can be utilized such as markers diagnosing symptoms and drug targets as well as antiviral and anti-cancer treatment [9]. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal (Calici_coat_C) and viral polyprotein N-terminal (Calici_PP_N) appears unlikely as a specific domain in Caliciviridae, whereas the domain of Calicivirus minor structural protein (Calici_MSP) can be used as the specific proteins of Sapovirus. In here, Calici_PP_N is found at the N-terminus of non-structural viral polyproteins of the Caliciviridae subfamily. However, Vesivirus can be detected by protein of unknown function of DUF743 in CDD. In Caliciviridae, all viruses have Calicivirus coat protein (Calici_coat) domain in common. Lagovirus and Nebovirus contain Lagovirus protein of unknown function (DUF840), respectively. Lagovirus has only two species including rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus.
In case of Picornaviridae that is the same type with Caliciviridae, RNA helicase is also conserved in all genera in Picornaviridae. Specially, in case of Enterovirus, picornavirus coat protein (VP4) (Pico_P1A), picornavirus core protein 2A (Pico_P2A), which is a protease triggering polyprotein decomposition, and picornavirus 2B protein (Pico_P2B), which enhance membrane permeability, can be considered with the specific domains as compared with the other viruses in Picornaviridae. However, the E-value of Rabovirus is higher than that of Entertovirus even if the domains of Enterovirus seems to have a similar pattern with that of Rabovirus. Hepatovirus has Hepatitis A virus viral protein VP (HAV_VP) as the specific domain. This protein is found in hepatitis A viruses and targeted to the liver. Cardiovirus has unlikely the subunit of viral protein VP4 (VP4_2) (Fig. 4).
Overall, in terms of the methodology searching the specific protein sequences in order to identify the virus, the viruses could be classified by RPS-BLAST search with CDD and CDS sequence queries, which are parsed from viral RefSeq GenBank data. The viruses of Caliciviridae and Picornaviridae of single-strained RNA type are conserved to RNA helicase in common, which plays important role for viral infections detection and grasping the innate antiviral immune response. Calici_coat_C, Calici_MSP, and protein of unknown function (DUF743) could be considered with the specific protein sequence of Norvirus, Sapovirus, and Vesivirus in Caliciviridae, respectively. In addition, in the case of Picornaviridae, which is the same type with Caliciviridae, Pico_P1A, Pico_P2A, and Pico_P2B could regard as the specific protein sequence of Enterovirus. Therefore, suppose the method of Fig. 1 is applied to all viruses, the specific protein domain of each virus could be determined or compared by conserved domain searching with RPS-BLAST. It would provide useful clues for searching the specific protein sequences. If the specific protein sequences are defined, it could be converted to gene sequences. It would be utilized usefully to find viral bio-marks based on functional structure information of protein domain as well as used as classification keyword.
