Target enrichment analysis
A normal sample (NA17022) and two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (H-1650 and H-23) were examined in this study. It is reported in the COSMIC database that the H-1650 cell line has a deletion mutation in the EGFR gene, while the H-23 cell line has mutations in the KRAS, STK11, and TP53 genes.
After target gene enrichment, the enriched DNAs were analyzed using qPCR with primers targeting the regions of interest, along with qPCR primers targeting irrelevant, non-amplified loci outside the target regions. The correlation between the replicates was high (average r2 = 0.97), and the majority of primer pairs clustered within a range of 3 Cts (threshold cycle in qPCR). Therefore, the enrichment was highly reproducible, and the enrichment bias was minimal.
The enriched DNAs showed an average Ct of 17 with the target primers, while primer pairs targeting loci outside of the target regions had average Cts of 33. This indicated that the enrichment was target-specific. The average specificity in the normal samples was 28% when calculated from the Ct and amount of enriched product (Table 2).
