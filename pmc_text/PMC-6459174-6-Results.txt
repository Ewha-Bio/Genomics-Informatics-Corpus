Our result showed that the mtDNA haplogroup F was significantly more frequent in athletes (12.6%) than in the control group (4.1%) (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.241 to 9.007; p = 0.012) (Table 2). In addition, multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust the confounding factor (sex); the adjusted OR and 95% CI for the mtDNA haplogroup F was 3.04 and 1.094–8.464, respectively (Table 2). We also performed the correlation analysis to identify a relationship between the physical performances and haplogroup F. Here, we found that athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) showed a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041).
