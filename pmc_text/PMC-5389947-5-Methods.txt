Relative Codon Adaptation (RCA)
Fox and Erill [18] proposed RCA that measures codon bias of a gene based on a set of highly expressed genes. RCA makes use of a given reference set to compute observed and expected codon frequencies. Relative adaptation for individual codon xyz is defined as RCAxyzi=fxyzf1(x)f2(y)f3(z) Using this, RCA for entire gene is computed as RCA=‚àèi=1LRCAxyz(i)lL, where fxyz is the observed relative frequency of codon xyz in any reference gene set, fi(m) is the observed relative frequency of base m at codon position i in the same reference set and L is the length of the query sequence.
