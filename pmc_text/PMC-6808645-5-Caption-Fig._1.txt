Schematic presentation of various sources of neoantigens. Somatic mutations in DNA (red star), alternative splicing (yellow bar), and RNA editing (pink bar) can introduce significant modifications of DNA or RNA molecules. Various regulation steps can induce sequence changes in the final gene products, and the resulting mutated peptides can be presented on MHC. Alternative splicing occurs in the cell nucleus, but RNA editing can be performed in the nucleus and cytosol, as well as within mitochondria. The colored circles shown in the cytosol indicate amino acids changed by genetic events.
