Challenges in NER for medical texts and chemical compounds
NER itself has proven to be a challenging task because of the ambiguity and complexity of human languages. In the particular case of CER, additional difficulties arise.
First of all, not all chemical names present distinctive patterns as far as name segments or chemical word morphology are concerned. CER systems are particularly sensitive with regard to both spelling errors and the tokenization strategy of choice since chemical documents usually exhibit hyphenated text segments or variable use of parentheses, brackets, dots, and other punctuation signs. In addition, chemical documents tend to be loaded with acronyms and abbreviations, which are one of the main sources of false positives.
Another characteristic that makes CER difficult is the fact that the detection of mention boundaries is especially cumbersome when long chemicals or modifiers are present. A more in-depth description of difficulties in tagging chemicals can be found at [6].
