Genotyping by GATK and comparison with SNP chip
In order to check the genotyping parameters we had used, 10 SNP chip results were compared. Because SNP chip data were genotypes, we could not infer copy number changes; we could only calculate concordance between exome sequencing and SNP chip. We had used a separate bioinformatics pipeline for checking concordance, and GATK [5] was used mainly for genotyping of germline samples. We had discovered 18,500-19,200 coding SNPs. The number of SNPs from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was close to that of the 3' UTR, so the target enrichment kit was not the latest 3' UTR extension version (Supplementary Table 3). In general, the 3' UTR is much larger than the 5' UTR; a new 3' UTR extension version of the exome kit will give at least a few times more SNPs than 5' UTR.
Two hundred fifty coding SNPs were retained after removal of dbSNP137 [6] and an in-house Korean database comprised of 54 normal individuals. Among them, we can focus on about 160 variants of NS/SS/I, which is believed to be most functionally important (Supplementary Table 4).
Overall concordance was at least 99.6%. In recent personal genome papers, they reported more than 99.95% concordance between whole-genome and SNP chips. Usually, one can achieve higher concordance if he uses strict parameters for their genotyping. Our purpose is to discover somatic mutations, not genotyping of normal germline, so we did not put much effort to get higher concordance values.
Especially, G10.N SNP chip data were totally different from the exome, because only 77% of SNPs were shared (Supplementary Table 5). As one can see in the table, 77% means they are different individuals (false positive for Award program). Distance and similarity matrix were calculated to see the differences and similarity (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Fig. 2). We had concluded that sample G06 has a different sample pair from different individuals. G10 also has only 92% similarity and showed a little similarity between G03 and G04. For such reasons, G10 was possibly contaminated and therefore rejected from our bioinformatics analysis.
In conclusion, we had used only 8 sample pairs for discovery of somatic mutations, LOH, and SCNA.
