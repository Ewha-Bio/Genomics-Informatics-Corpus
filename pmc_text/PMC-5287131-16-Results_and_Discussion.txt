Molecular docking analysis
The results of molecular docking were intended for energetically favorable binding poses for each nine natural compounds within the active pocket (LbH domain) of proposed drug target of B. petrii (Fig. 5A) as lowest binding energy and inhibition constant are generally preferred for favorable binding mode while docking small compounds with target protein molecule [4243]. Again, among them isoorientin (–5.66 kcal/mol), curcumin (–5.38 kcal/mol), isovitexin (–5.22 kcal/mol) found with lower binding energy and inhibition constants i.e., 71.35 µm, 114.67 µm, and 149.85 µm, suggesting as strong inhibitors of lpxD protein. Further, the binding stability was proved through existence of hydrogen bonding pattern between the protein-ligand complexes (Table 5). Presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues within the binding site highly contributes towards the stability during molecular interaction between protein and small compound. Here, the resulted hydrophobic interaction between the docked complexes also supported for a strong binding affinity of natural compounds towards the proposed drug target (lpxD) of B. petrii (Table 6, Fig. 7). Also, the presence of some positively and negatively charged amino acid residues of lpxD within 4 Å distance from the ligands suggested for electrostatic force of interaction between docked complexes (Table 6, Fig. 7). Again, among nine active natural compounds, isoorientin (–5.66 kcal/mol) was observed as the most suitable inhibitor with lowest binding energy and inhibition constant (71.35 µm), and formed hydrogen bond with amino acid residues like Ala 186, Glu 149, and Gly 227 of lpxD (Table 5, Fig. 7F). Strong hydrophobic interactions were seen due to presence of Val 165, Ala 186, and Leu 226 within 4 Å distance from the ligand (Table 6, Fig. 7F). All of these above observation established isoorientin to be a strong inhibitor against lpxD of B. petrii.
In conclusions, Identification of potential drug target has a vital role in designing a novel drug against any infectious disease. B. petrii strains have been reported as causing infections in humans and various warm blooded animals. In the present investigation, authors attempted to narrow down the complete data set of known 5,031 protein sequences of B. petrii DSM 12804 (accession No. PRJNA28135) in order to identify a potential drug target computationally. In silico study revealed lpxD protein of B. petrii as a potential drug target, is an essential protein of the pathogen and involved in the biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide. Again, the observations made through computational study also strongly supported lpxD to be a potential drug target due to the absence of lpxD protein in any human essential pathways as well as without any significant percentage of sequence homology with human and human gut flora micro biota. Again, previous literature reports also established the involvement of lpxD in nosocomial infections caused due to pathogens and hence, could be used as a potential drug target [1516] against B. petrii. Furthermore, due to adverse effect of synthetic drugs, the uses of active natural compounds have gained an increasing attention towards the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases. Moreover, some of the phytochemicals like ajoene (garlic), allicin (ginger), cinnamaldehyde (Chinese cinnamon), curcumin (turmeric), gallotannin (green tea and red wine), isoorientin (blueberry relative found in Central and South America), isovitexin (blueberry relative found in Central and South America), neral (lemon balm), and vitexin (blueberry relative found in Central and South America) have been reported as having anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial properties, might be used against COPD, cystic fibrosis, QS biofilm formation, nosocomial infection, and other types of bacterial infection [202122232425]. Therefore, authors excited to apply molecular docking approach to check the inhibitory effects of above mentioned nine natural compounds (Table 4, Fig. 6) against the proposed drug target (lpxD) of B. petrii. The docking study results also supported for the confirmation of the mechanism of blocking of lipid A biosynthesis in B. petrii which is essential for the survival of the bacterium. Again, isoorientin was noticed with highest inhibitory effect among nine natural compounds supported by lowest binding energy and inhibition constant (Table 5). Binding stability was also confirmed through observation of strong hydrophobic, electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions between protein-ligand complexes (Tables 5 and 6, Fig. 7F). Hence, isoorientin could be suggested as most suitable natural compounds against the proposed drug target (lpxD) of B. petrii. The overall hypothesis generated through implementation of in silico approach would be a great aid and value towards designing a novel drug against B. petrii infection and which would be further validated through in vitro experiments.
