Osteoporotic fractures (OFs) result from a decrease in bone strength, which can be induced by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration in bone tissue [1]. OFs are the critical hard outcome of osteoporosis, a disease that affects more than 75 million people in the United States, Europe, and Japan. With a lifetime fracture risk of 30% to 40% (vertebral or non-vertebral fractures), osteoporosis has an incidence rate similar to that of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, with the exception of forearm fractures, OFs are associated with increased mortality. Most fractures cause acute pain and lead to patient hospitalization, immobilization, and slow recovery [234].
Genetic studies have suggested a correlation of genetic variations with OF and its related traits. First, a candidate gene study has reported that common non-synonymous variants in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) are consistently associated with bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk [5]. Furthermore, meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in more than 56 loci independently associated with BMD, and some of these studies have also found associations with fracture risk [678910111213].
Copy number variations (CNVs) also have shown associations with OF. A genome-wide CNV study performed in a Chinese population identified a deletion variant of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17 (UGT2B17) in chromosome 4q13.2 associated with OF [14]; however, this variant was not replicated in a study of Caucasian women [15], possibly showing ethnic specificity. Additionally, a rare deletion variant located on chromosome 6p25.1 showed an association with the risk of OF in a Dutch population [16].
Particularly, chromosome 20q13.12 is known as an enriched region of histone modifications. Many genes located on chromosome 20q13.12 have enriched levels of histone modifications, such as di-methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me2) and tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4me3), in their promoter regions [17]. H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 regulate the expression of the Runx2 gene, which encodes a transcription factor controlling bone development and osteoblast differentiation [18]. Although there is no previous study on an association between chromosome 20q13.12 and bone-related traits, an SNP in another 20q region (rs4811196 in CTNBL1, located on 20q11.23) has been reported to be associated with BMD [19].
In this study, we conducted an association study in the Korean population to identify new susceptibility loci for the risk of OF. We identified 8 CNV regions associated with the risk of OF through a statistical analysis. Among the 8 regions, we selected and validated the existence of one CNV by quantitative PCR.
