Variant calling and annotation
Ion Proton platform-specific pipeline software (Proton Suite v4.4; Life Technologies) was used to separate the barcoded reads, generate sequence alignments with the hg19 human genome reference, perform target-region coverage analysis, and filter poor signal reads. Initial variant calls were generated using Proton Suite with a plug-in program (variant caller v4.4). Variant calls were further analyzed using internally developed software that allows variant filtering and annotation using refGene in University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), 1000 Genomes, COSMIC v.67, dbSNP build 138, and ExAC. To minimize false positives, variants were filtered with a normal population variant database, The Korean Personal Genome Project (http://opengenome.net/) [12].
