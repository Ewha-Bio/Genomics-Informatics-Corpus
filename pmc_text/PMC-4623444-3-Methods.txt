Insulin-mediated genes
To select differential genes before and after insulin treatment in 20 insulin sensitive individuals, we carried out paired t test and calculated gene expression fold change. Using local commands of R program, we selected insulin-responsive genes which were significantly dysregulated at p-value (paired t test) < 0.01 (corresponding to FDR [13] â‰¤ 0.05) and fold change > 1.2 (Fig. 1). We looked for enriched GO terms of the insulin responsive genes using DAVID Functional Annotation Tool [14].
