Cells perceive changes in the extracellular environment and create appropriate responses through a complex network of interwoven signaling cascades. For example, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes severe inflammatory responses by binding to and signaling through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on the cell surface, and events downstream of TLR stimulation are extremely dynamic [1, 2]. The inner core regions of all LPS molecules contain at least one 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic acid (KDO) residue, which possesses endotoxin toxicity that is nearly equivalent to LPS itself [3, 4]. We studied how KDO-mediated signal transduction through TLR4 could be modulated by the presence of interferon-β (IFN-β) and/or 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br). IFN-β uses the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and 8-Br is a cell-permeable analog of cAMP that is regulated by Gαs- or Gαi-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In response to LPS, TLR4 activates the MyD88-independent pathway to produce tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) [5], whereas 8-Br activates cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which binds to cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sequences, 5'-TGACGTCA-3', and is also a substrate for various cellular kinases [6-10].
The rationale behind the present investigation was to understand the pathway interactions among KDO, IFN-β, and 8-Br and how each of these pathways modulates the signaling from others. If two separate pathways triggered by two distinct ligands regulate the transcription of the same gene, then concomitant stimulation with both of the ligands should result in an additive response equivalent to the sum of the separate responses [11]. In contrast, if the pathways intersect or modulate each other, concomitant addition of the ligands would yield a non-additive response that is either greater than or less than the expected additive response.
