It was the first time in the history of bioethics that member states committed themselves and the international community to respect and apply the fundamental principles of bioethics set forth within a single text consisting of 28 articles. This Declaration addresses ethical issues related to medicine, life sciences, and associated technologies as applied to human beings, taking into account their social, legal, and environmental dimensions. The aims of this Declaration include: to recognize the importance of freedom of research and the benefits derived from scientific and technological developments, while stressing the need for such research and developments to occur within the framework of ethical principles; to respect human dignity, human rights, and fundamental freedoms; to safeguard and promote the interests of the present and future generations; and to underline the importance of biodiversity and its conservation as a common concern of humankind. The following information is the content of the Declaration that is relevant to genetics and genomics [7].
Article 16 emphasizes the impact of life sciences on future generations, including their genetic constitution. To protect the environment, the biosphere, and biodiversity, Article 17 encourages to pay due regard to the interconnection between human beings and other forms of life, to the importance of appropriate access and utilization of biological and genetic resources, to respect for traditional knowledge, and to the role of human beings. Article 21 requires that, in transnational practices, States should take appropriate measures, both at the national and international levels, to combat bioterrorism and illicit traffic in organs, tissues, samples, genetic resources, and genetic-related materials. However, some experts criticize the process of drafting the Declaration, which excluded a necessary group of stakeholders, and claim that the Declaration therefore fails to provide the guidance that can be readily applied in different settings [8].
