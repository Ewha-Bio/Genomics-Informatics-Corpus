Genome-wide SNP analysis
SNP genotyping was performed using the Axiom genotyping solution, including an Axiom Genome-Wide ASI 1 Array Plate and reagent kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, total genomic DNA (200 ng) was treated with 20 µL of denaturation buffer and 40 µL neutralization buffer, followed by amplification for 23 h using 320 µL of Axiom amplification mix. Amplified DNA was randomly fragmented into 25 to 125 base pair (bp) sizes with 57 µL of Axiom fragmentation mix at 37℃ for 30 min, followed by DNA precipitation for DNA clean-up and recovery. DNA pellets were dried and resuspended with 80 µL of hybridization master mix; 3 µL of suspended sample was kept for sample qualification. A hybridization-ready sample was denatured using a PCR machine at 95℃ for 20 min and 48℃ for 3 min. Denatured DNA was transferred to a hybridization tray and loaded onto a GeneTitan MC with an Axiom ASI array plate (Affymetrix). Hybridization continued on the GeneTitan for 24 h, followed by loading of ligation, staining, and stabilization reagent trays into the instrument. After chip scanning, the cel intensity file was normalized, and genotype calling was done using Genotyping Console 4.1 with Axiom GT1 algorithms according to the manufacturer's manual. The cut-off values for data quality control were DISHQC ≥ 0.82 for hybridization and QC call rate ≥ 97%.
