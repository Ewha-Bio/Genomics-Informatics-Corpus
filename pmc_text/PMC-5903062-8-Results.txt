GO in Hanwoo and Holstein
Table 1 shows the results of a DAVID analysis of GO terms for genes with low substitution rates (Hanwoo ＜ 7 × 10-11; Holstein ＜ 6.5 × 10-11). The criteria was substitution rates below diving regions. Most terms were regulation. It is obvious that regulatory genes would have low substitution rates. Table 2 shows GO terms of genes with different substitution rates between Hanwoo and Holstein. The major GO terms were related to blood and circulatory system. The criteria of genes was an over 20-fold difference in substitution rate between Hanwoo and Holstein (Fig. 4). Supplementary Table 1 shows the total genetic substitution rates and those ratios between Hanwoo and Holstein for protein-coding genes. The averages of gene substitution rates in Hanwoo and Holstein were 4.1 × 10-10 and 2.9 × 10-10. This was concordant with the simulation study of substitution rates (see Materials and Methods). We used the pseudocount 10-13 where the substitution rate in Holstein was estimated at zero to calculate the ratios.
