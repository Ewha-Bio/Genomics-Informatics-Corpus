A retron is a 2-kb-long bacterial retroelement that carries a promoter and three genes: msr, msd, and ret. The msr/msd part of the transcript is processed by a reverse transcriptase encoded by ret, resulting in an RNA/DNA chimera called multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA) [1]. The RNA and DNA parts of msDNA are encoded by msr and msd, respectively. The precursor RNA molecule possesses a palindrome between the 5' and 3' ends, forming a doublestranded region between both ends (Fig. 1A). The 5' part of the palindrome is followed by a G residue, which is the branching point for covalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B) [2]. The msr portion of the precursor RNA possesses two stem-loop structures, which are recognized by the reverse transcriptase [3]. The msd part of the resulting chimera, shown in black in Fig. 1C, is palindromic, also forming a large hairpin structure.
While msDNA is found in many bacterial species, its biological role is not well understood. Furthermore, msDNA is not well annotated in public sequence databases. In order to facilitate the biological characterization of msDNA, we set out to compile msDNA sequences from known bacterial genomes. Using a few known msDNA sequences, we extracted common sequence and structural features. We screened National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq bacterial genome sequences using this rule to compile potential msDNA sequences. Their authenticity as msDNA needs to be confirmed experimentally.
