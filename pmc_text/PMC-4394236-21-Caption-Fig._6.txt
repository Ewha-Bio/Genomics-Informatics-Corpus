Time-dependent root mean square deviation (RMSD) (Å) and radius of gyration (Å) for the β-ketoacyl reductase model during 5 ns of molecular dynamics simulation. (A) The RMSD trajectories of the backbone atoms of the apo-protein are shown in blue and the holo-protein in red. (B) The radius of gyration trajectories for the apo-protein are shown in blue and the holo-protein in red.
