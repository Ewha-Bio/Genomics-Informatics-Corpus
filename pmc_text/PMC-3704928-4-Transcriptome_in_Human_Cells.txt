Long noncoding RNAs
LncRNAs are nonprotein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. LncRNAs have been known to have similar characteristics as coding RNAs. They are polyadenylated, associated with chromatin signatures, and have multiexonic structure [20, 21]. Some lncRNAs use identical or almost identical transcription initiation complexes [22] and sometimes overlap with protein-coding genes and can be transcribed from either strand [22, 23].
GENECODE interrogated the properties of 15,512 lncRNAs. Table 2 summarizes the comparison between lncRNAs and coding RNAs. Expressed lncRNAs have an activating histone modification profile similar to that of protein-coding genes, with slightly excess levels of both silencing (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K36me3) marks in lncRNAs [24]. Although many lncRNAs are polyadenylated, they are significantly enriched in nonpolyadenylated transcripts compared with coding RNAs [24]. As expected, the lncRNAs have significantly lower protein potentials compared with mRNAs. Interestingly, they are biased toward two-exon transcripts and predominately localized in the chromatin and nucleus, while coding RNAs are predominantly observed in the cytosol; only 6% of them have a 2-exon structure.
In order to identify the function and targets of lncRNAs, Derrien et al. [24] investigated the correlation between lncRNAs and coding RNAs; both positive and negative correlations were found. Overall, the number of positive correlations was larger than the negative correlations. Compared with trans-acting lncRNAs, cis-acting lncRNAs showed more positive correlations. Interestingly, lncRNAs that intersected protein-coding exons in the antisense orientation showed a strong pattern of coexpression [24]. They also checked sequence conservation by BLASTing human lncRNAs against all available mammalian genomes. Around 30% (n = 4,546) of lncRNAs appeared to have arisen in the primate lineage, and 0.7% (n = 101) of them appeared to be human-specific [24].
