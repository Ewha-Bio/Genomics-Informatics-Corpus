Palindrome motif search
One of the characteristic features of msDNA is a palindrome formed by its 5' and 3' ends. In order to detect such a feature in the potential retron sequences, we used a local installation of the software tool palindrome in the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) bioinformatics software package [6]. It requires several options to be set. The minimum and maximum lengths of a palindrome and the maximum distance between a palindrome pair were set to 5, 10, and 200 bp, respectively, while the number of mismatches between a palindrome pair was set to 1.
