Relative expression patterns of miR-21-3p (A) and PPIL2 (B) in various tissues of olive flounder. Data are normalized to U6 and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in miR-21-3p and PPIL2, respectively. This results are presented as mean ± standard deviation. A paired t-test was indicated to gain p-values and to check statistically important differences in expression levels of miR- 21-3p and PPIL2 (*p ≥ 0.15).
