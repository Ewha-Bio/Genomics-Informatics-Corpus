Molecular docking between miRNA-mRNA and AGO protein
Docking between three dimensional structure of protein and ligand, may be a biomolecule like miRNA or a gene is an efficient computational method to inspect the molecular interaction [61]. Docking were performed between AGO protein and miRNA-mRNA duplexes (miR-106 and PTEN; miR-21 and TGFBR2; and miR-29b-2 and VEGFA) using PatchDock web server (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/),algorithm ranked the docked complexes on the basis of highest geometrical shape complementary scores. The molecular interaction was studied using Discovery Studio 3.5 suite.
