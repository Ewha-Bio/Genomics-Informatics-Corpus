Generalized canonical correlation analysis
Among various methods of dealing with a multi-block dataset, GCCA is used in this paper. Since it is extended from CCA, we start with an explanation of CCA. CCA is a method of inferring information from cross-covariance matrices. If there are two vectors X = (x1, ···, xn) and Y = (y1, ···, ym) of random variables and if there are correlations among the variables, the linear combinations of xi and yj to maximize the correlation with each other—termed canonical variables— are found through CCA [10].
GCCA is a way of extending CCA to adapt to more than two sets of random variables after removing dependencies within each set. The basic structure of CCA is to derive a new linear combination of the variables, called canonical variables, constituting each set and to estimate the correlation between canonical variables. In other words, canonical variables summarize the information inherent to the abbreviated set of multivariate data [11]. GCCA can be divided into two methods: using correlations and using covariance. In our paper, we use a method of analysis based on covariance. GCCA based on covariance uses the variance of ‘block scores’ to compute the residual matrices. For instance, in an Xk variable block, we can denote ak = (ak1 ak2 ··· akpk)′ as the coefficients for each variable in Xk block. Therefore, the canonical variables, yk (k = 1, ···, K), are expressed as:
y 1 = X 1   a 1 = a 11   X 11 + ⋯ + a 1 p 1 X 1 p 1 ⋮ y K = X K   a K = a K 1   X K 1 + ⋯ + a K p K X K p K
The optimization problem is as follows.
argmax { a 1 , a 2 ⋯ a k } ∑ i , j = 1 , i ≠ j K c i j g ( c o v ( X i a i , X j a j ) )
The optimization problem tries to find coefficients of each block a1, a2, ···, aK that would maximize the weighted summation of the covariance of the two components. The cij in the equation implies the relationship between variable block Xi and Xj. If they have a relationship, we could assign cij = 1; otherwise, we could assign cij = 0. The function g() can be various functions, such as horst (g(x) = x), centroid (g(x) = |x|), and factorial (g(x) = x2). Among these methods, we applied horst methods. A design matrix C = (cjk) is pre-specified by the user to express the relationships between blocks. The element cjk is equal to 1 if block j and block k are connected and 0 otherwise [12, 13].
