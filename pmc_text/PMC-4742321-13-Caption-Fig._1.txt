Typical workflow for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data analysis. This workflow shows an example for expression quantification and differential expression analysis at gene and/or transcript level using RNA-seq, which is typically consisted of five steps as following: preprocessing, read alignment, transcriptome reconstruction, expression quantification and differential expression analysis. For each step, currently available programs are written in Table 1. QC, quality control.
