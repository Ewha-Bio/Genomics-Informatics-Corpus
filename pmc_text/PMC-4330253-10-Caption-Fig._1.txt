Manhattan plot of metabolic syndrome genome-wide association study -log10(p-values). All black and grey circles indicate the individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The red horizontal line is the genome-wide significance level (p = 5 × 10-8), and the blue horizontal line is the genome-wide suggestive level (5 × 10-8 ≤ p < 1 × 10-5). The top significant SNPs are depicted on the right site of the SNP.
