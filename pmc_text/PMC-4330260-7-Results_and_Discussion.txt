The fasting serum glucose and insulin levels of our subjects are shown in Table 1. We divided subjects into 4 groups, based on BMI; most Korean subjects lay in the 20 ≤ BMI < 25 and 25 ≤ BMI < 30 categories. The MAGIC study had BMI cutoffs of < 25 and ≥ 30, and 237 of our subjects (4%) had BMI ≥ 30. Asians have lower rates of overweightedness and obesity than Western populations, per conventional definitions (BMI ≥ 25 for overweightedness and ≥ 30 for obesity) [3]. Despite having lower BMIs, Asian countries have a similar or greater prevalence of diabetes versus Western countries [12]. Thus, we used BMI < 25 and BMI ≥ 25 to analyze the effects of SNPs and SNP-dichotomized BMI interactions by stratum.
Of the 6 SNPs that were associated with FSI levels in the MAGIC studies, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, and no SNP was replicated in all 3 statistical tests (stratified BMI, continuous BMI interaction p-values, and dichotomized BMI interaction p-values) (see Table 2). Of the 7 reported SNPs that were linked to fasting plasma glucose levels, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, and 1 SNP (rs2293941) in pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) was significantly associated in lean subjects (beta ± SE, 0.007 ± 0.002; p = 0.001) but not in overweight subjects. The SNP-continuous BMI interaction was not significant, but the SNP-dichotomized BMI interaction was marginal (p = 0.04).
Our results indicate that the novel loci that were identified by MAGIC are poorly replicated in other ethnic groups, although we do not know why. We have identified an important genetic factor of glucose metabolism, PDX1, which regulates pancreatic beta-cell function and survival by governing expression of the insulin-encoding INS gene [13].
This study was limited by its exclusion of 3 other SNP-BMI interactions from MAGIC. These SNPs could not be extracted from the imputation data using the original Affy 5.0 in the KARE study. Another limitation of this study was the relatively weak significance of its association results compared with those of MAGIC. We do not know whether this lack of significance is due to the relatively smaller sample size of this study compared with MAGIC, the inaccuracy of imputation genotypes, or ethnic differences in the SNP-BMI interactions. These issues should be addressed in other Asian populations.
Although the replication of gene-environment interactions in other ethnic groups is difficult, interethnic conservation of the interaction results might help us determine the underlying mechanisms of the target phenotypes. Further, the rs2293941 SNP might help us understand individual differences in beta-cell function.
