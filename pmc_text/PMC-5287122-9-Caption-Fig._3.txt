Most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism pairs identified by sGIDS. sGIDS reveals strongly associated 2-order interactions between 2 loci with fasting, OGTT-1h, and OGTT-2h blood glucose values categorized as a single multi-class phenotype. sGIDS, standardized generalized index of dissimilarity; OGTT-1h, 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT-2h, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.
