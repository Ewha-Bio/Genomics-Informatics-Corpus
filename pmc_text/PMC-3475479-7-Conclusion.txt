NGS technology provides a cost-effective way of sequencing for novel whole-genome sequencing, resequencing, and expression profiling. Rohce/454 pyrosequencing is recommended to de novo assembly of whole prokaryote novel genomes, while hybrid assembly with Illumina/Solexa sequences would be optimal for whole eukaryote genomes and transcriptome studies of non-model organisms. Also, Illumina/Solexa sequencing is useful in detecting DNA variation, mapping the short-read resequence to the reference genome and profiling expressed genes in model organisms. Furthermore, the high-throughput NGS sequencing enables us to study with an in silico method in variable research application fields of molecular genetics, including population diversity and comparative genomics, in a short time.
