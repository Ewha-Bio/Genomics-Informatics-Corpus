RpoB of MTB, encoded by Rv0667, has 1172 amino acids in its protein sequence, while E. coli rpoB has 1342. The S531L and H526Y mutations are based on the protein sequence of E. coli rpoB protein. Upon sequence comparison using ClustalW [33] of rpoB protein in both species, it was found that in MTB, the mutation occurred at codon positions 450 (S450L) and 445 (H445Y) as compared to E. coli (Fig. 2).
