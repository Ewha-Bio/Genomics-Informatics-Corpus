After 5,000 iterations with the training set, the accuracy was calculated from each training set and test set, with values of 100% and 55.56%, respectively.
In the training set, the macro-average AUC, micro-average AUC, and all the AUC values for one-versus-rest (OVR) decisions were all 1 (Fig. 3A). In the test set, we observed a macro-average AUC of 0.71, and a micro-average AUC of 0.77 for five-class classification and prediction using our model. The OVR AUCs for stages (equivalently, classes) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4S were 0.8, 0.66, 0.59, 0.85, and 0.58, respectively (Fig. 3B). Overall, we observed that our model predicted stage 1 and 4 patients well.
