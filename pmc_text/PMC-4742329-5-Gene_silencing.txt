In addition to above-mentioned translational regulation, it has become apparent that some tRFs mediate gene silencing similarly to miRNAs by binding to Argonaute family proteins [161747]. The first tRFs suggested to be involved in the gene silencing are some tRF-5 and -3 molecules [32]. Haussecker et al. observed that they are in association with Ago-3 and -4 and exhibit trans-gene silencing activity. However, this activity is much lower than that of miRNAs. On the other hand, some groups showed that the tRF-5 series have inefficient association with Argonautes [34] and do not exhibit detectable silencing effects [31].
Probably the most convincing result is from our recent studies on a tRF-5 molecule derived from mature tRNAGluCTC (tRF5-GluCTC). Upon infection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), tRF5-GluCTC is induced robustly and plays a gene-silencing role on a target mRNA with a reverse complementary target sequence. In this case, the trans-silencing mechanism used by this tRF was distinct from that of canonical miRNA/siRNA. Mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the 3'-portion of tRF5-GluCTC is critical for its gene silencing function, in contrast to miRNAs whose 5'-portion is the key determinant in target recognition [5].
