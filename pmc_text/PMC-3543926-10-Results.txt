Construction of fosmid vector libraries
Before constructing the fosmid vector libraries, several domain or species-specific PCR reactions were performed. Both the Prebiocide and Tank A samples and the control (DNase-free water) showed amplification with different primer sets (Fig. 3). Primer pairs used for species-specific PCR amplification to detect the microbial diversity are listed in Table 1 [24-26]. After constructing the fosmid vector libraries, 4,000 clones from the Prebiocide sample, 2,290 clones from the Tank A sample, and 3,450 clones from the control were picked. As expected, NotI digestion of the fosmid DNA released and produced inserts that were more than 40 kb in size (Fig. 4). Subsets digested with the NotI enzyme were sequenced. Only DNA sequences that exhibited more than 80% similarity with an existing GenBank sequence were included in the analysis.
