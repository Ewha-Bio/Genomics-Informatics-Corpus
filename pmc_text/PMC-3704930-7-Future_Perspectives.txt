With emerging advances in NGS, RNA-seq has uncovered the complexity of the bacterial transcriptome. Although transcriptional regulation by asRNAs, novel ncRNAs, and alternative splicing events have been well known in eukaryotes, similar regulatory events in prokaryotes have been newly elucidated in recent studies. In accordance with technological developments, several approaches for computational pipeline and bioinformatics analysis have been also progressed. Here, we review sequencing methods, their advantages, and several key results for bacterial transcriptome analysis. Undoubtedly, RNA-seq is having a breathtaking impact on our understanding of biological systems and will provide entirely new insights into the biological parts in living genomes. Furthermore, the concept of artificial genetic circuits has been advanced in synthetic biology, due to their simplicity in manipulating the cell [48]. For example, promoters, sRNAs, ncRNAs, and ribosome-binding sites are considered as biological parts in a cell, which can be used to assemble new genetic circuits, such as switches or oscillators. A wide range of biological parts can be screened and listed up from transcriptome analysis by NGS. Nevertheless, many efforts to develop diverse experimental approaches using NGS methods will reveal the unexpected complexity of bacterial transcriptomes.
