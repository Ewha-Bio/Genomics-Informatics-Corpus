Gelatin zymography
Conditioned media were separated with the use of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) containing 0.2% gelatin. The gel was renatured with 2.5% Triton X-100 buffer for 1 h and incubated with developing solution (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2) for 18-20 h at 37â„ƒ. The gel was then stained with 0.5% Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) in 30% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid and destained with the same solution without dye.
