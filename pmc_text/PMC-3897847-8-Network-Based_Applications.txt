From the advances of high-throughput technologies, large-scale networks have been identified and are available from various public databases, as summarized in Table 1. In this section, we focus on network-based applications, especially how to use previously identified network resources in order to obtain meaningful biological interpretations. We first introduce three basic concepts in graph theory [53] to give an overview of the basic concepts of the network-based methods. First, a neighborhood of a node is a set of nodes connected to the node. Second, the distance between two nodes is defined as a length of the shortest path between them if the path exists; otherwise, it is set to infinity. Finally, an adjacency matrix is a binary and symmetric matrix such that its ij-th element is equal to 1 if there is an edge from a node i to a node j; otherwise, it is 0. In some cases, a weighted adjacency matrix can be used to represent the strengths of edges that usually fall between 0 and 1. With these basic concepts, we introduce three network-based applications: protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and genome-wide association study.
