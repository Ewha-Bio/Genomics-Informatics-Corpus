Molecular modelling and structural validation of drug target
Phyre2 server was used for modeling of the tertiary structure of NA protein. It predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein sequence using the principles and techniques of homology modeling. Because the structure of a protein is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence, a protein sequence of interest (the target) can be modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related sequence of known structure (the template), provided that the relationship between target and template can be discerned through sequence alignment [19]. YASARA Energy Minimization Server [20] was employed for structural refinement and energy minimization of the predicted model. The refined model reliability was evaluated through ProCheck [21], ProSA-web [22], ProQ [23], and ERRAT server [24].
