In this review, we discuss the amplification of Alu elements and its impact on human genomic rearrangements and human disease. Four different models: master gene, intermediate, transposon, and stealth models have been suggested to explain the Alu amplification during primate evolution. Among them, master gene model is generally accepted to explain the diversity of Alu subfamilies. Since the divergence of human and chimpanzee, Alu elements have caused various genetic/genomic rearrangements in the human genome through human-specific insertion, deletion, and recombination. Alu elements could repair DSBs in the human genome using microhomology between the element and the break point, leading to de novo Alu insertion. In spite of the positive effect, Alu element is considered to be one of major factors to cause human genomic instability because many Alu elements are associated with various human diseases. The recombination between Alu elements has deleted human genic regions and subsequently disrupted gene function, leading to human diseases. The abundance of Alu elements in the human genome and a high level of sequence identity among them predispose them to be a tremendous and unpredictable factor to cause genomic instability and the related human diseases. Characterization of Alu amplification in the human genome and elucidating the mechanisms which Alu elements could utilize to cause human diseases may help us understand Alu-associated pathogenesis and predict Alu-associated human diseases.
