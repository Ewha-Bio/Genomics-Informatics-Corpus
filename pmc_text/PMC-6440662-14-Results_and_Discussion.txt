ROC curve
The average accuracy of the employed pipeline was identified 93.6% in our analysis which indicated that outcomes of the functional annotation of HPs were predicted with a high degree of confidence. We have also found sensitivity of 100% and specificity 64.3% for the tools used in this study. Finally, area under the curve was found to be 0.774. AUC is an effective way to summarize the overall diagnostic accuracy of the test. It takes values from 0 to 1, where 0.7 to 0.8 is considered acceptable.
