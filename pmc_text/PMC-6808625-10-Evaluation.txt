Data
For evaluating PharmacoNER tagger, we used the SPACCC dataset, a manually annotated corpus of 1,000 clinical cases written in Spanish and annotated with mentions of chemical compounds, drugs, genes, and proteins. In particular, the set of labels consists of Normalizables (4,398 labels), No Normalizables (50 labels), Proteins (3,009 labels), and Unclear (167 labels). Note that Normalizables and No Normalizables refer to chemical entities. For instance, the word “triglicéridos” (triglycerides) is annotated as Normalizable, while “receptores de progesterona” (progesterone receptors) is labelled as Proteins. One can notice that the dataset is heavily imbalanced. The dataset has not been released yet due to an ongoing shared task (http://temu.bsc.es/pharmaconer).
