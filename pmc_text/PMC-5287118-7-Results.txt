Step 2: Quantitative prediction
We made quantitative prediction models based on SLR, LASSO, and EN using the entire training dataset. Then, the MSE was calculated by applying the quantitative prediction models to the test dataset. Table 4 and Fig. 3 show the performance of each quantitative prediction model in the test dataset. The model using only covariates yielded an MSE value of 10.24. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the prediction model created from Group 5 yielded the smallest MSE. Fig. 4 describes the comparison results between the numbers of SNPs and MSEs from the prediction models using SLR.
Among all sets, the case that used LASSO to select variables and SLR to create the model showed the smallest MSE value of 9.64 in ASIAN-100, with 51 SNPs. Among the 51 SNPs of LASSO-SLR with one set from ASIAN-100, 28 SNPs were mapped to genes (Table 5). Some genes, such as FTO, GP2, AKAP6, ANKS1B, ADCY3, and ADCY8, have been reported to be associated with BMI [282930313233].
