Patients
The parents and guardians of the probands were informed about the microarray study and given information about the risks, benefits, and limitations of CMA testing. Informed consent was obtained by a clinical geneticist or the researchers.
The study sample comprised 42 individuals (29 males, 13 females), ranging in age from newborns to 38 years, who had negative test results for metabolic disorders and other suspected disorders and did not present with any recognizable syndrome.
Clinical data, including medical history, were collected from the medical records and the parents and guardians of the probands. General observations for dysmorphic features were made, and the height and head circumference were measured by the clinician or the researchers.
