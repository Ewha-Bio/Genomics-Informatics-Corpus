Functional analysis of ROS-hypertension gene set
The 68 targets that were significantly associated with ROS and hypertension were tested for functional enrichment analysis. Three functional analysis tools, SciMiner, Web-Gestalt, and DAVID, identified 34 significantly over-represented biological functions in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway [13, 14]. The most significant biological pathway from the 3 functional analysis tools was focal adhesion, involved in the cell communication pathway group (Table 4). The most frequent pathway group was cancer pathways (n = 9), such as glioma and pancreatic cancer. Eight other pathways related to signal transduction and 11 organismal system pathways (level 1) related to the immune system, endocrine system, and nervous system were significantly identified.
