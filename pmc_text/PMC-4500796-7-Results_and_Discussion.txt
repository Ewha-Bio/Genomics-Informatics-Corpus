Effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of variants for clinical use
To investigate the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of clinically meaningful variants, we first sequenced the whole blood DNA samples from ten breast cancer patients using the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high sequencing depth of ~200× (Fig. 1A). The platform covers 95% of the human exonic regions (http://www.gemomics.agilent.com). We then extracted data at depths of 20× to 200× by random selection and shuffling (Fig. 1B). Next, we performed read mapping, local realignment, duplicate marking, and base quality recalibration for each sample (Fig. 1C). Diverse variations such as SNPs, and insertions and deletions (indels) were called by using the GATK [16]. We also called function-related variations after the annotation of functional and regional information using various open databases and tools (Methods). Finally, we analyzed counts, positions, reading depths, and genomic coverage of the identified variations as a function of the sequencing depth using total or diagnostic gene sets (Fig. 1D).
We first checked the numbers of called SNPs in protein-coding (denoted as "coding SNPs") and total genomic regions (denoted as "total SNPs") of the platform in order to assess the effect of sequencing depth on the discovery of SNPs (Fig. 2A). As expected, the numbers of the identified total SNPs increased at higher average sequencing depths. For example, the median number of total SNPs for the ten samples gradually increased from 33,765 at 20× to 114,707 at 200× (an increase of 80,942 for the total SNPs). However, the median number of SNPs in the coding regions increased more rapidly in the first half (an increase of 59,073 from 20× to 120×), and reached a plateau at an average sequencing depth of around 120×. The increase in the number of coding SNPs was significantly smaller after that (an increase of 827 from 120× to 200×). This also means that the number of non-coding SNPs detected, both intronic and intergenic, increased rapidly after a depth of 120× was achieved. This phenomenon was more or less consistent across the sequencing data, from the first sample to the last. This trend was also preserved in the indel variants (Supplementary Fig. 1). Further, the number of indels in the total region of the platform (denoted as "total indels") increased steadily, but the increasing ratio of indels in the coding regions ("coding indels") leveled off after a depth of 120× was achieved.
After functional annotation using the SnpEff database [20], we analyzed the numbers of functional SNPs (nonsense, missense, and silent) while increasing the sequencing depth. The results indicate that the median number of missense SNPs detected in the ten samples increased from 6,015 to 9,731 (Fig. 2B). However, the rate of increase was sharp in the first half, slowing significantly after 120×. We observed a similar trend for the nonsense SNPs as well. In addition, this phenomenon was also observed for the deleterious SNPs using the SIFT [21] (Fig. 2C). In summary, the number of deleterious SNPs detected, such as missense and nonsense, increased with the sequencing depth, but the ratio of this increase reduced significantly after 120×.
Mutations in splice sites are associated with many diseases [252627]. Therefore, we next analyzed the number of SNPs detected near splice sites with respect to the sequence depth (Fig. 3). We found that the number of called SNPs increased with increasing depth. However, many of the SNPs were detected in intronic regions around the splice sites, about twice the number of those detected in exonic regions, when increasing the sequencing depth. The number of detected SNPs, though, was lowest at the splice sites. This might imply that the sequences of the exonic regions surrounding the splice sites are well conserved than those of the intronic regions. However, researchers who wish to detect susceptible SNPs in splice sites might have to sequence at depths of more than 120×. Similarly, all the variations reported in the dbSNP database were also more common in the intronic, rather than the exonic regions (Supplementary Fig. 2).
To summarize, the number of deleterious SNPs and indels detected in the coding regions (which are widely used in clinical diagnostics) was only weakly increased a depths more than 120×. In other words, a sequencing depth of 120× can be considered reasonable when using the exome capture sequencing technique to identify significant variations in diagnostic studies.
