Study subjects
Students, aged between 8 and 13 years, were recruited from Gwacheon City and Kyunggi Province from April to June 2010. This study was performed as a part of the Korean Children-Adolescents Study (KoCAS), which has been monitored yearly since their entry into elementary school at age 7 in Gwacheon City or fourth grade at age 10 in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, Korea. Subjects who were enrolled in a specific diet program or were taking any medications known to affect appetite were excluded from the study. AST and ALT levels were measured in the serum of each subject. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul Paik Hospital, Inje University, and the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Informed consent was obtained from the childrens' parents.
