Automatic filtration of candidate msDNA sequences
The candidate retron sequences identified above were filtered by the presence of palindrome motifs. Using the local python script, we searched the 16,844 bacterial sequences for palindrome motifs 5â€“10-bp-long and separated by less than 200 bp within 2 kb upstream of ret, yielding 7,428,332 such hits. These hits were then screened by the HMM models that were developed based on the prototype msDNA sequences. There were 3,865 hits surpassing the crossvalidation threshold of 45.0. Using a local installation of CentroidFold, the RNA secondary structures were predicted for the remaining hits, and those without the proper double-strand pairing between the 5' and 3' ends were removed. Furthermore, those without the conserved flanking G residues were also filtered out. The whole process, which was wrapped in a Linux shell script, resulted in 625 hits.
