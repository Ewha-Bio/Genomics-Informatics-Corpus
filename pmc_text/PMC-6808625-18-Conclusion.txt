In this article we have introduced PharmacoNER tagger, a neural NER based on an existing state-of-the-art system, NeuroNER. We extended and especially adapted to the particular domain of chemical compounds in Spanish medical texts. The results in the validation set of the experiments with the SPACCC dataset have showed that the best configuration consisted of the FastText Scielo + Health Wikipedia embeddings, the POS, and the gazetteer, which have proven to be an additional source of information that can be leveraged by neural networks. In the test set, the aforementioned best configuration obtained an F1 score of 89.06. The extension to the network is domain-agnostic and could be used in other fields, but the pre-processing steps have been specifically designed for our domain.
CER involves additional challenges to the ones already present in generic NER. Our work shows that some of the sources of additional information typically used in previous CER systems based on non-neural techniques, such as affixes, can be leveraged as well by state-of-the-art neural NER systems.
We foresee that this resource will be a valuable contribution not only to semantically enhance medical texts in Spanish for pharmacological and drug-related information, but it also highlights a useful approach on how to implement medical NER taggers for languages other than English. Moreover, PharmacoNER tagger will be a useful competitive baseline system and design principle for the upcoming PharmacoNER BioNLP 2019 shared task.
