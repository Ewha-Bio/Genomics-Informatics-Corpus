Non-coding RNA localization
Specific classes of non-coding RNA-short RNAs (viz. micro RNA [miRNA], short interfering RNA [siRNA], and piwi-interacting RNA [piRNA]) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA)-regulate gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, influencing several cellular processes, like X chromosome inactivation [51], genomic imprinting [52], and some cellular processes [53], and cancer [54]. LncRNAs tether epigenetic complexes capable of methylating DNA and modifying histones to the chromatin, enabling allele- and locus-specific regulation. For example, lncRNA Xist covers the inactive X chromosome and recruits PCR2, a Polycomb complex responsible for trimethylation of H3K27 [51]. Furthermore, lncRNAs, by virtue of their length, are suited for orchestrating specific regulatory events particular to a target locus [55].
Additionally, miRNA (~22 nucleotides long) have shown to be linked with cancer and can act as either oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes. They can be involved in establishing DNA methylation and regulating histone modification by interacting with their target mRNA to alter chromatin of the corresponding DNA template [56]. siRNA, and its interference machinery has also been implicated in the formation of heterochromatin [57].
A catalog of small RNAs has been generated by deep sequencing of total RNA from whole transcriptomes using smRNA-seq technology [34]. Selection of smRNA can be carried out by sequential ligation of adapters to its unique 5' mono/triphosphate ends, produced as a result of processing the smRNA population in the cell [58]. On the other hand, lncRNA are poly-adenylated, and much of the challenge in identifying them from whole-genome mRNA-seq data [33] lies in the computational and analytical domains [59].
