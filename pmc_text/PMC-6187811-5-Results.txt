Validation of fidelity on sequenced barcodes
In the study, 8,708 barcodes from 4,354 deletion strains covering 88.5% (4,354/4,919) of all ORF genes (4,919) were amplified by colony PCR and used for the analysis of barcode sequences. At that time, 565 strains (11.5%) were under construction by gene synthesis method [15], and they were not available for barcode analysis. As shown in Table 1, out of the 8,708 barcodes from the 4,354 strains tested, 7,734 barcodes (88.8% in total, block PCR 87.7% and serial PCR 91.0%) were validated to be inserted at the correct positions on both sides—so called “high-fidelity.” The remaining 974 barcodes (11.2%, so called “medium- or low-fidelity”) were characterized only on either side.
