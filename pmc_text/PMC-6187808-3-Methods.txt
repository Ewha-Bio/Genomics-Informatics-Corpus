Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses for the genetic associations and meta-analysis of the SNPs were performed using PLINK (ver. 1.07) [15]. To test the association with KD, we performed the chi-square test to compare allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls. To analyze the significance of differences in the distribution of variables of clinical characteristics in each genotype group, we used SPSS ver. 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test for normality of the continuous variables. The continuous variables with a non-normal distribution were described by median and interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney U test was used in the continuous variables and the chi-square test was used in the categorical variables to contrast the genotype groups depending on the distribution of the data. The functional prediction of nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796) was performed by PolyPhen and SIFT programs.
