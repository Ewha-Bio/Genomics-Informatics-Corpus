The genomic and epigenomic landscape of differentially methylated CpG sites in obesity
We next identified the CpG sites differentially methylated between obese and control individuals. A total of 6,041 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified to have a significance level of p < 0.001. The false discovery rate (FDR) was 0.08 when the Benjamini-Hochberg method was applied to adjust the p-values. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows a Manhattan plot for the log-transformed significance levels of all CpG sites investigated.
Fig. 3A shows an uneven distribution of differentially methylated CpG sites with respect to the six gene-based CpG categories. The over- and under-representation of differentially methylated CpG sites was observed in gene body, TSS200, and TSS1500 regions (p = 4.6 × 10−50, p = 4.33 × 10−12, and p = 4.33 × 10−19, respectively). When the genomic context of CGIs was taken into account (Fig. 3B), a relative deficit of differentially methylated CpG sites in the nearby TSS regions was observed in CGIs, while the enrichment of differentially methylated CpG sites in the gene body was observed at regions distant from CGI (i.e., CGI shelves and others).
Next, we divided the differentially methylated CpG sites into hypermethylated and hypomethylated sites in obese children. We annotated them as ‘obese-hypermethylated and obese-hypomethylated CpGs’ to distinguish them from the hypomethylated/hypermethylated CpG sites identified in individual M-value profiles. We observed a dominance of obese-hypomethylated CpG sites (79.1%; 4,779 sites) over obese-hypermethylated CpG sites among all of the differentially methylated CpG sites (Fig. 3C). We then investigated the relative ratio of obese-hypermethylated to obese-hypomethylated CpG sites in gene-based and CGI-based regional categories (Fig. 3D and 3E). The majority of differentially methylated CpG sites in the gene body and 3′ UTR regions were obese-hypomethylated CpG sites (the ratios of obese-hypermethylated/obese-hypomethylated CpG sites in these regions were 0.13 and 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, the differentially methylated sites in the genomic regions near the TSS, such as the TSS200 and first exon regions, were mainly composed of obese-hypermethylated CpG sites (the ratios were 2.14 and 1.52, respectively) (Fig. 3D). A dominance of obese-hypermethylated CpG sites was also noted in CGI regions (the ratio was 1.64), whereas CpG sites in CGI-shelf regions were largely obese-hypomethylated (the ratio was 0.02) (Fig. 3E). Of note, 70.8% of obese-hypermethylated CpG sites were found in CGIs.
Next, we categorized the differentially methylated CpG sites according to 15 different chromatin states, as described in the ChromHMM software [16]. Given the tissue-specific epigenetic configurations, we elected to use the annotation dataset of lymphoid origin (from the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line) as the profile that best matched ours. We first observed that the differentially methylated CpG sites were overrepresented mainly on transcribed regions (Fig. 4A). The p-values were 2.91 × 10−3, 1.63 × 10−11, and 8.31 × 10−16 for the 9_Txn_Transition (transcription transition), 10_Txn_elongation (transcription elongation) and 11_Weak_Txn (weak transcription) regions, respectively (Fisher's exact test). It was also observed that promoter and enhancer regions were largely depleted of differentially methylated CpG sites. In particular, all promoter-related states represented in the first three state categories (1_Active_Promoter, 2_Weak_Promoter, and 3_Poised_Promoter) showed underrepresentation for the differentially methylated CpG sites (Fig. 4A). That is, as we observed in the genomic regional abundance analysis, the differentially methylated CpG sites were mainly found at the genomic regions marked for active transcription. When the differentially methylated CpG sites were categorized into obese-hypermethylated and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites (Fig. 4B), a majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites in transcribed and promoter-related regions were obese-hyper- and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites, respectively. For instance, 96.6% of CpG sites in active promoter regions, as well as 95.7% and 62.4% of CpG sites at poised promoter and weak promoter, respectively, were obese-hypermethylated CpG sites. In contrast to the promoter regions, 95.7% of the differentially methylated CpG sites in transcriptional regions, annotated in ChromHMM as transcriptional transition, elongation, or weak transcription, showed lower DNA methylation levels in obese children.
