Regulation of NF-κBζ and interleukin 6 (Il-6) by all ligands. (A) NF-κBζ, which is highlighted in black arrow, was regulated by 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO) as well as by triple-ligand stimulation in RAW 264.7 cells. (B) Il-6 was regulated by interferon-β (IFN-β) at 120 min, but triple ligands upregulated Il-6 robustly as early as 60 min itself. 8-Br, 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate.
