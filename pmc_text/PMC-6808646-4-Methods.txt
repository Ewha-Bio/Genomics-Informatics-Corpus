Design of PCR primer pairs and gene-specific tags
Notable components of bar-code regions are represented in the schematic drawing shown in Fig. 1A. For amplification of up- and down-tags, pairs of each 20-mer primer, the universal primers U1/U2 and D1/D2, were theoretically designed (shown as two pairs of rectangles in the insets of Fig. 1A). Optimal PCR primer sets were empirically selected by the criteria of maximizing the yield and minimizing the extra bands (shown as two pairs of arrows, also refer to Fig. 3). The length of the four chosen primers was a 20/19-mer and a 17/18-mer for U1/U2 and D1/D2, respectively. For fluorescence detection of hybridization, biotin was linked at both ends of the anti-sense primers (shown as asterisks).
The sense strands of the bar-codes were designed for tiling on the array using the criterion of melting temperature (Tm, 60–65℃), GC content (30%–70%), and cross-hybridization with other bar-codes and genomic DNA regions (exact matches of no more than 10 bp, corresponding to a blast score lower than 20), as shown in Fig. 1B. Finally, ~11,000 bar-code sequences were selected through the above criteria with an average Tm of 62℃ (Fig. 1C).
