Storing binary information in a long-read DNA molecule
Binary data are encoded by two types of DNA fragments, each representing 0 or 1. Each fragment type will serve as a molecular unit to represent 0 or 1. A longer fragment that is composed of 0 or 1 DNA fragments can be synthesized and ligated to store more digital data in a single copy of a DNA molecule. Nanopore sequencing enables one to generate a long-read DNA sequence. Fig. 1 depicts a schematic diagram of the writing/recording strategy of this study.
