Selection of ligands for pharmacophore modeling
From the ChEMBL [15] database, we retrieved 52 compounds known to be targets of APE1 and 51 compounds with an IC50 of less than 10 Î¼M. By eliminating redundancy, the number of compounds was reduced into 83. The list did not contain methoxyamine; so, methoxyamine was also added to the list.
We clustered these 84 compounds by Tanimoto distance, based on the PubChem fingerprint [16], and finally categorized them into two groups by excluding two outliers (CHEMBL1213633 and CHEMBL313493) (Fig. 2). A total of 49 molecules in group 1 (Fig. 3) and 33 molecules in group 2 (Fig. 4) were used to generate pharmacophore models 1 and 2, respectively.
