Detoxification
Proteins involved in detoxification and antioxidant defense are abundant in lung type II transcriptome. The redox system of glutathione (GSH) consists of primary and secondary antioxidants, including GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase and GSH S-transferase [45]. Depletion of GSH in the lung is associated with the increased risk of lung injury and disease [46]. Nrf2 plays a major role in detoxification by sequence-specific binding to ARE and up-regulating several genes [47,48]. Pathogenesis of lung diseases is tightly linked to exposure to environmental chemicals which require an enzymatic activation to exert their deleterious effects on pulmonary cells [49]. Nrf2 has a potential chemo-preventive activity, by upregulating antioxidant defenses and attenuating of inflammation and oxidative stress. Deficiency in Nrf2-GSH signaling attenuates type II cell growth and enhances sensitivity to oxidants implicated in cigarette smoke induced emphysema [46,48]. Metallothionein regulates the intensity of the induction of inflammatory proteins such as chemokines and cytokines. In Mt knockout mice the induction of cytokines and chemokines as well as pulmonary inflammation were greater in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Mt protects against coagulation and fibrinolytic disturbance and acute lung injury by inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators [50]. Knockdown of Nr4a1 in human lung epithelial cells resulted in significant increase in IkB-Î± phosphorylation and degradation resulting in enhanced NF-kB activity, whereas Nr4a1 overexpression decreased NF-kB activity [33,51]. Nr4a1 knockout mice show significantly enhanced allergic airway inflammation and aggravated mucus production [33].
