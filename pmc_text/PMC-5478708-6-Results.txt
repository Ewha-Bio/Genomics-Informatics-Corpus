Treatment of HDFs with COX inhibitors
We have previously shown that among COX inhibitors studied, NS-398, a COX-2-selective inhibitor, inhibited replicative cellular senescence in HDFs as well as skin aging in hairless mice, whereas celecoxib, another COX-2-selective inhibitor, and aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, accelerated the senescence and aging. At that time, we treated cells or skin with inhibitors every day for more than a month (Table 1) [36].
To figure out causal factors for the senescence-modulating effect of the inhibitors, we treated HDFs with NS-398, celecoxib, aspirin, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (the vehicle) every day for only 3 days in this study. The IC50 values have been reported for recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2 of NS-398 and celecoxib [1011], and for recombinant ovine COX-1 and COX-2 of aspirin [12]. In the case of NS-398 and celecoxib, we used approximately 10-fold higher concentration of IC50 to inhibit COX-2 catalytic activity sufficiently. NS-398 and celecoxib showed no acute cellular toxicity at this concentration. In the case of aspirin, however, we used IC50 because 10-fold higher concentration caused acute cellular toxicity (Table 1) [6].
