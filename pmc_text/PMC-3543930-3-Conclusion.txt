By identifying the relevant subclasses of bioinformatics patents, the research gaps between science and technology can be identified. In this paper, I did a preliminary study of the current status of bioinformatics patents registered in the KIPRIS database. I identified some of the subclasses and groups related to bioinformatics patents, but the work presented here should be regarded as preliminary, and a more detailed analysis using text-mining techniques will follow in the near future.
