Numbers of called non-synonymous (NS)/splice site acceptor or donor site (SS)/coding indel (I) in the diagnostic gene set and the ClinVar database according to different sequencing depths. (A, B) Numbers of NS/SS/I per depth used in the human genome (A) or in the 175 diagnostic genes (B). (C) Numbers of NS for the diagnostic genes in the ClinVar database per number of depth used. (D) Numbers of variants in the genes associated with breast cancer among the diagnostic genes in the ClinVar database. The x-axis represents increasing sequencing depths.
