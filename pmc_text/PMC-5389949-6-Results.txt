Visualization
Data preprocessing steps are not supported by visualization functions in previously developed packages, while proper visualization is essential and powerful for evaluating the quality of the RNA-Seq data and the preprocessing steps. TRAPR provides five flexible plotting functions, including density, boxplot, MA, scatter, and meanâ€“variance plots. Volcano plots and heatmaps are also provided to visualize the results of statistical analysis. Each visualization function has direct access to FPKM values and differential expression values.
