Relative Codon Bias Strength (RCBS)
The expression measure of a gene, RCBS [192021] is given by RCBS=‚àèi=1L(1+dxyzi1/L-1 and dxyzi=fxyz-f1(x)f2(y)f3(z)f1(x)f2(y)f3(z), where dxyzi is the RCB of ith codon of a gene, fxyz is the normalized codon frequency for the codon xyz and fn(m) is the normalized frequency of base m at codon position n in a gene. L is the number of codons in the gene.
