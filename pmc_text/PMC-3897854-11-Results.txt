Genetic polymorphisms of MRP2 in the Korean population
MRP polymorphisms covering all MRP2 exons, exonintron junctions, and the promoter region up to -2.3 Kb from the translation initiation site have been described in the Korean population [24]. We investigated 11 of the polymorphisms from previous studies in 110 healthy control people and 168 epileptic patients. We found four promoter, four exonic, and three intronic polymorphisms among them.
