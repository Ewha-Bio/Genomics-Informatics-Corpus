Schematic representation of the the artificial neural networks for a single token in PharmacoNER tagger: Snippet of the architecture used in PharmacoNER tagger. All notations are the same as in Fig. 1. We added the following features in the character-enhanced token embeddings: Vp is the mapping from the specific token to its Part-of-Speech, Va is boolean mapping to identify if the given token contains any of the affixes in the database, and Vg is a boolean mapping to the gazetteer database. RNN, recurrent neural network.
