The histogram of the genetic values of G-BLUP (A), SNP-BLUP (B), and SNP-GBLUP (C). The genetic value distribution was similar to the normal distribution. G-BLUP, genomic relationship matrix-based best linear unbiased prediction; SNP-BLUP, single nuleotide polymorphism (SNP)-best linear unbiased predictor; SNP-GBLUP, SNP-genomic linear unbiased prediction.
