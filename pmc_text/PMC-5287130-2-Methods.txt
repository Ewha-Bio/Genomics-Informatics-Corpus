Sequence retrieval, alignments, and expression data acquisition
The list of apoptosis involved genes coding proteins with different molecular functions and localizations in the cell were drawn from the Deathbase (http://deathbase.org/) (Supplementary Table 1). In order to minimize the statistical errors, multiple alignments were performed for the sequences by ClustalW program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk), and finally, 65 genes were selected for our study. Normalized expressions of genes were directly drawn from SOURCE, 2014 (Stanford Microarray) database (Source.stanford.edu) (Supplementary Table 1). The normalized gene expression in this database presents the relative expression level of a gene (defined as a UniGene Cluster) in different tissues and is “normalized” for the number of clones from each tissue that are included in UniGene (http://source-search.princeton.edu/help/SOURCE/normalization.html). This database links to the microarray experiments that included the queried genes. Thirty four different tissues were selected and in each tissue, the average expression level, the number of expressed genes, and the highest expressed gene were recognized.
