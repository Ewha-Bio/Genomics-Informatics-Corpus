Phylogenic analysis
A heat-plot based on a 200/100 BLASTN fragmented alignment drawn with Gegenees software is shown in Fig 1. A phylogenic overview is also shown in the heat-plot. A more detailed phylogram was constructed with SplitsTree 4 software, as shown in Fig. 2.
CDT-producer E. coli strains were displayed a sporadic, phylogenomic pattern in the heat-plot, with a lack of a consensus pattern. Six distinct genomic groups of CDT+ strains (T1 to T6 in Fig. 2) were shown in the phylogram, all of which were sporadic among the strains in Fig 1. As a sporadic pattern of CDT-producing strains was observed in the bacterial population in the phylogram for specific clades, these strains were related and some degrees of similarity were also found.
