Penwell et al. [18] described that the gene cluster that is involved in acinetobactin production and its utilization exists in the chromosomes of different A. baumannii strains. In addition, the gene cluster is found in A. baumannii AYE, which is a natural entA mutant incapable of producing acinetobactin [18, 19]. However, the cognate clusters in the A. baumannii AB0057 and ACICU strains contain the additional putative genes AB57_2807 and AB57_2818 [20], and ACICU_02575 and ACICU_02586 [21], respectively (Fig. 1). In the case of A. baumannii AB307-294, three additional predicted genes, ABBFA_001054, ABBFA_001053, and ABBFA_001065, are also added in the bas-bau-bar gene cluster (Fig. 1) [20]. Although the functions of these additional genes in siderophore production and its utilization are not characterized, these results indicate the possibility that genetic diversity in acinetobactin gene clusters could be closely linked to the virulence of A. baumannii.
