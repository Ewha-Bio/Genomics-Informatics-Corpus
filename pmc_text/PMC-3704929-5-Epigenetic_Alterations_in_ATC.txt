Since the epigenetic changes of tumor-associated genes are known to play important role and have physiological function in the development of various human cancers and its progression [51, 52], they may also influence to the tumorigenesis of the most malignant form of thyroid cancer, ATC. In PTC cells, genome-wide hypermethylation was found by a recent study using DNA methylation microarray which is revealed to be driven by BRAFV600E signaling [53]. Other couple of papers focused more to the change of methylation pattern in ATC. Schagdarsurengin et al. [54] analyzed the methylation pattern of 17 gene promoters in ATC, included those involved in DNA damage avoidance and repair (MGMT, GSTP1), apoptosis (DAPK, UCHL1), cell cycle control (p16, RB), tumor invasion and metastasis (TIMP3, CD26), hormone response (RARβ, ERα, ERβ), signal transduction (PTEN, RASSF1A), regulation of thyrocyte function and growth (TSHR), and other tumor-associated genes (DLC1, SLC5A8). Among these genes, they found that TSHR, MGMT, UCHL1, p16, and DAPK were frequently methylated in ATC.
PTEN, as a well-established tumor suppressor, is involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway. Hou et al. [55] found that PTEN methylation is necessary to progress the malignancy from benign thyroid adenoma to FTC and aggressive ATC. The methylation of a gene is usually associated with its silencing and the increased methylation of PTEN in ATC is in concordance with decreased or even lack of PTEN expression in previous reports [56, 57]. They also found that PTEN methylation in thyroid tumors was closely associated with the activating genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including mutations in Ras, PIK3CA, PTEN gene and PIK3CA amplification [55].
Four microRNAs (miRs) (-30d, -125b, -26a, and 30a-5p) were reported by Visone et al. [58] as decreased in ATC compared with normal thyroid tissue. From these, miR-26a and -125b may be targeting HMGA1 and HMGA2 which are known to be involved in thyroid cell transformation [59]. In other report by Mitomo et al. [60], found the upregulation of miRs-21, -146b, -221, and -222 and downregulation of -26a, -138, -219, and -345 in thyroid cancer. From these, miR-21 targets E2F (involved in cell cycle and apoptosis) and inhibits PTEN. Interestingly, miR-138 which was found to be downregulated in both study of Visonet's and Mitomo's group [58, 60], targets hTERT which is also found to be reduced. Takakura et al. [61] identified ATC specifically deregulated miRNAs in ATC cell line. They found that overexpression of miR-17-92 cluster of 7 miRNAs (miR-17-3p, -17-5p, -18a, -19a, -19b, -20a, and -92-1), which has a crucial role in cell growth and survival. Additionally, miR-17-3p and -17-5p 5p were overexpressed in 3 out of the 6 ATC patient samples.
