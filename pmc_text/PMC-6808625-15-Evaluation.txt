List of affixes
The list of affixes was retrieved from a biomedical website (http://blog.nclexmastery.com/drug-stems-prefixes-roots-suffixes/) and translated into Spanish. The final format is a tab-separated file, with the type of affix (e.g., suffix, prefix, or root), the affix in English, the affix in Spanish, an example in English and the Drug class. For PharmacoNER tagger, only the columns type, and affix in Spanish are used.
