Following these candidate approach studies was a two-staged GWA study that was performed in Korean GDM women [27]. A total of 468 GDM women and 1,242 nondiabetic control women were genotyped using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0. Variants that passed the prespecified p-value threshold in the stage 1 genome scan were further genotyped in 931 GDM women and 783 nondiabetic control women. Two variants, one located in an intron of CDKAL1 (rs7754840) and one near MTNR1B (rs10830962), were associated with a risk of GDM at a genome-wide significance level (p = 6.65 × 10-16 and p = 2.49 × 10-13, respectively). This was the first GWA study investigating the genetic risk factors of GDM. Although variants in MTNR1B have been previously reported to be associated with increased fasting glucose levels, the study was the first to report that MTNR1B variants are associated with GDM at a genome-wide significance level. One of the limitations was that it was not sufficiently powered to find truly novel genetic variants that were only specific in GDM. It should be noted that current GWA and GWA meta-analysis performed in T2DM recruits more than 100,000 cases and controls [28]. One of the interesting findings was that genetic variants of T2DM were enriched in GDM subjects. Among the 34 confirmed T2DM genetic variants, 8 were associated with a risk of GDM [27]. In addition, when the β-coefficients (or odds ratio) of the variants derived from the logistic regression were compared between GDM and T2DM, there was a significant positive correlation of β-coefficients between the two [27]. These findings suggest that GDM and T2DM might share similar genetic backgrounds, at least in part.
