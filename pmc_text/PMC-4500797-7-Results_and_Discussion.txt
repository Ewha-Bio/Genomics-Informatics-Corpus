For a systematic comparative analysis of chromatin regulation and transcription regulation, we carried out QTL mapping in a unified analytical framework by applying the identical statistical methods and criteria for open chromatin and gene expression data in yeast and human (Methods and Fig. 1). From the human chromatin accessibility data [8], we selected chromatin sites at the promoter or enhancer (as defined by Ernst et al. [21]). Yeast and human QTL mapping was different in the genetics setting (linkage vs. association) and technical platforms (DNA microarray vs. RNA-seq and FAIRE-seq vs. DNase-seq) (Fig. 1).
We selected significant trans-associations based on the p-value of linear regression and then examined the distribution of linkages between regulatory loci (genetic markers) and quantitative traits (gene expression levels or chromatin accessibility). First, there were particular regulatory loci that were associated with a large number of target chromatin traits but not with gene expression traits both in human and yeast (Fig. 2). Second, expression traits than chromatin traits were associated with a greater number of regulatory loci (Fig. 3). This trend was consistently found when varying p-values were used (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the number of targets for chromatin regulatory loci is more dispersed resulting in outliers with extremely many targets while the average number is lower as compared to the pattern of expression regulatory loci (grey vs. white in the upper panel of Fig. 4). On the other hand, the number of associated regulatory loci was much greater for gene expression traits in terms of the outliers and average as well (grey vs. white in the lower panel of Fig. 4).
These findings can be interpreted as follows. There are a few regulatory hotspots that are responsible for a large number of chromatin sites. Most regulatory loci, however, tend to influence fewer chromatin traits than gene expression traits. Different biological functions are expected between the promiscuous and specific chromatin regulators. On the other hand, gene expression seems to be more reactive to genetic variation when judged by the number of associated regulatory loci. This may imply that transcription processes receive more regulatory inputs than chromatin regulation, in which case chromatin accessibility may not be a good predictor of precise gene expression levels. There was a remarkable consistency of the data for two evolutionarily distant species across different technical platforms and experimental settings, thereby supporting the biological implications of the findings while ruling out the possibility of technical artifacts.
Based on these findings, we propose that chromatin regulation mechanisms have evolved a stable genetic architecture while the transcription regulatory network maintains high genetic complexity and connectivity and is more susceptible to mutations. First, the lower number of associations per chromatin trait suggests that chromatin structure is more robust to genetic perturbation. On the contrary, gene expression traits have more associations, increasing the probability of targets being associated with mutations. Second, chromatin associations are biased to a handful of loci responsible for an extremely large number of chromatin sites. As long as these hotspot loci are protected from mutations, the perturbation of chromatin regulation architecture could be minimized. In contrast, the average number of associations is high for transcription regulatory loci, increasing the overall effect of single mutations. Given the higher probability of expression traits being associated with mutations and the greater influence of individual mutations on transcription, it is conceivable that phenotypic diversity is more likely to be created in response to genetic variation at the level of transcription processes downstream of chromatin regulation steps.
