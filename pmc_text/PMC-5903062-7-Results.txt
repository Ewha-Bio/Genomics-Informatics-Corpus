Substitution rate
Fig. 2 shows the density of Hanwoo (Fig. 2A) and Holstein (Fig. 2B) substitution rates. The density of substitution rates showed the presence of a region in which the density showed significant decrease and increase. We might consider that this diving region differentiated the protected regions from unprotected regions. The substitution rates of the boundary regions in Hanwoo and Holstein were 7 × 10-11 and 6.5 × 10-11, respectively (/bp/y).
Fig. 3 shows Manhattan plot of substitution rates. It shows that the distribution of substitution rates between Hanwoo and Holstein was somewhat different across the genome. Fig. 4 shows the genetic substitution rate of Holstein against that of Hanwoo.
