COEX-seq
COEX-seq is a web-based application using Shiny (Shiny; a web application framework for R) [7, 8] that converts a variety of measurements of gene expression in RNA-Seq experiments. It provides a workflow that includes loading data set, selecting measurements of gene expression, and identifying gene names. COEX-seq is freely available for academic purposes and can be run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux operating systems. Source code, sample data sets, and supplementary documentation are available at https://github.com/kimsc77/COEX-seq.
