Data selection, analysis, and visualization
Features that were differentially expressed in response to ligand stimulation were identified with Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA, http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limma). The Benjamini-Hochberg method was used to control the false discovery rate [14]. Four independent experiments were used to identify differentially expressed genes, and p < 0.05 by ANOVA was deemed statistically significant. The average log2-(treated/control) and the average difference (avg.DIF) were hierarchically clustered to visualize the patterns of gene expression changes and the nonadditivity, respectively [15]. Only features with significant expression changes and significant nonadditive responses at one or more time points were included, respectively. Clustering was done one way across the features with experimental conditions aligned in ligand, followed by time course orders. Euclidean correlation coefficient and complete linkage were used as similarity metrics [16]. The hierarchical clustering program that was used was implemented in the Multiple Experiment Viewer (MeV, www.tigr.org/software/tm4/mev.html).
