Effects of mutant HNF-1β on the mRNA levels of GLUT2 and INS in MIN6. MIN6 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant HNF-1β. Thirty hours after the transfection, cells were harvested and prepared for quantitative PCR analysis. Isolated RNAs were quantitated by real-time PCR using specific primers for GLUT2 and INS. The mRNA level of each gene was normalized by 18S. (A) The transfection efficiency was about 60%-65%, measured by GFP transfection in MIN6 cells. (B) The wild-type and mutant HNF-1β proteins were expressed well by Western blot. GLUT2 (C) and INS mRNA (D) levels are represented as means ± SE of five independent experiments. veh, vehicle; WT, wild-type; HNF-1β, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β; GLUT2, glucose transporter type 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein. *p < 0.05.
