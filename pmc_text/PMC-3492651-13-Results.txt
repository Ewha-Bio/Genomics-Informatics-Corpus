8-Br differentially regulated key inflammatory genes
The 8-Br-regulated genes were involved in transcription, signaling, inflammation, apoptosis, metabolism, proteolysis, transport, and cell cycle regulation (Supplementary Table 3). Treating cells with 8-Br upregulated several immediate early transcriptional targets, including nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (Nr4a2), Gadd45 beta, Dusp1, Pde4b, Crem, Cebpb, Vegf, Bag3, and v-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene family protein F (Maff).
Surprisingly, we observed that 8-Br treatment downregulated transcription of Rgs16, Tnf, Cxcl4, Ptger4, Tnfsf9, c-Myc, and Map3k8 by more than 2-fold (Fig. 3A). 8-Br can influence the mitogen-activated protein kianse (MAPK) pathway by downregulating Mapk3k8. Map3k8 activates the kinases p38 and JNK and the transcription factors NF-κB and NF-AT, although its specialized role is to activate the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway downstream of most TLR signals [20-23]. We observed 8-Br-mediated downregulation of 2 proto-oncogenes, c-Myc and Map3k8, and a cell cycle gene, Gadd45α (Supplementary Table 3), which emphasizes that 8-Br cAMP may also have important inhibitory roles in cancer cell proliferation [24, 25].
We next hypothesized that the co-downregulated genes may have common transcription factor binding sites; therefore, we examined their promoter regions using TOUCAN (http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~saerts/software/toucan.php) and analyzed the genes downregulated by 8-Br using MotifMogul (http://xerad.systemsbiology.net/MotifMogulServer). We found AP1 and/or NF-κB subunit binding sites in the upstream regions of all of the downregulated genes, which adds to evidence from previous studies [26, 27]. Among these genes were several classical targets of NF-κB (for example, Tnf) and AP-1 (for example, c-Myc and Gadd45α); these genes are highlighted with arrows in Fig. 3A and shown in greater detail in Fig. 3B. Since protein kinase A (PKA) activation by cAMP suppresses the MAPK cascade through phosphorylation of Raf [28], we can not exclude the possibility that elevated cAMP may, in part, reduce the transcription of the targeted genes by modulating protein binding to AP-1 sites, by inhibiting the ERK pathway through Raf, and/or by specifically affecting NF-κB subunits. Importantly, Il-1β was up-regulated quickly, whereas Il-1α and Il-10 were not affected prior to 120 min of stimulation. This differential mRNA regulation of genes that are all involved in inflammation suggested that cAMP utilized more than one distinct mechanism to alter the expression of specific sets of genes.
