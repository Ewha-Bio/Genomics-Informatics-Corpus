Association between folate pathway genes and gastric cancer risk
One thousand two hundred sixty-one gastric cancer patients and 375 control groups were included in the present study. From 17 SNPs, rs1476413, rs2066470, rs2274976, rs3737964, rs4846048, rs7533315, rs1805087, rs1532268, rs2303080, rs162036, rs2287780, rs16879334, and rs10380 had a minor allele frequency less than 5%. For each SNP, the p-value of Ï‡2-test and OR were calculated (Table 3).
Significant associations between genotypes of folate pathway SNPs and the risk of gastric cancer were only observed for rs1801394 (p < 0.05). In rs1801394, the frequencies of the AG heterozygote genotype were 0.411 and 0.366 in patients and control groups, respectively. The risk of gastric cancer in patients with the risk allele was increased as OR, 1.39 (codominant model; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.85) or OR, 1.34 (dominant model; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75) with statistical significance (p < 0.05).
