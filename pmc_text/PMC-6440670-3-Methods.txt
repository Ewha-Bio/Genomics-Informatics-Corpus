DNA fragment unit for storage of binary information
In our scheme, 1 and 0 will be recorded in a specific sequence that we call the “signal,” flanked by random sequences that we call “noise,” in Fig. 2. The DNA sequence located in the signal part, “TATT” or “ACCC,” determines whether the DNA fragment represents 1 or 0. The noise region consists of a random linker that has a dissimilar sequence to the signal sequences providing space between signals. The noise region also contributes to DNA synthesis, reducing repeats.
Digital information will be recorded in a DNA molecule that consists of restriction sites, a data block, and sequences to represent the start and end of the data block (Fig. 3). The data block contains a series of noise and signal units synthesized, as it depends on the digital data to store. DNA molecules can be further ligated to form a longer DNA molecule to store more digital data in a single copy of a DNA molecule.
