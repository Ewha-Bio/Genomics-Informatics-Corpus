Pipeline to remove heterogeneity
To remove transcriptome heterogeneity, DeMix [15], a statistical tool for deconvolving mixed transcriptomes, was used for 2,803 variable genes with a coefficient of variation of over 0.5 due to the high requirement of computer memory. In order to identify DEGs confidently, three different tests (t-test, Wilcoxon test, and median difference test) were performed with 1,000 permutations. Using POINTILLIST [16], the three p-values from each test were integrated into one. Genes with absolute fold-change over 1.25 and p-values less than 0.01 in COPD and normal subjects were regarded as DEGs. Functional and pathway enrichment assays of DEGs were carried out by DAVID [17]. Biological terms with p-values less than 0.01 were considered significant.
