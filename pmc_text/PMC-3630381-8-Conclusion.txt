The ENCODE project results have dramatically increased our knowledge about chromatin and its regulation. The results have forced us to think better about genetics. The ENCODE consortium has developed multiple technologies and approaches to discover the functional elements encoded in the human genome. This project generated more than 15 trillion bytes of raw data, mapping diverse chromatin properties in several cell types. Data generated by the ENCODE project are freely available and have been used by many researchers. By using the ENCODE data, we discovered the presence of boundary nucleosomes for specific histone modifications in open chromatin. Although the ENCODE project has provided a unique and informative window through which to view evolutionary change, it has looked only at 147 types of cells, and the human body has 1,000 cell types. The project is just the start of a long journey to understanding the mysteries of our genome.
