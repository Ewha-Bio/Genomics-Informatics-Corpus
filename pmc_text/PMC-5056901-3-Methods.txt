SNP genotyping
In this study, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus, rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) that were identified to be associated with SLE from a previous GWAS [12] but have not been tested in a Korean population. Five SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for allelic discrimination. TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence measurements were performed using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using a 384-well plate according to the manufacturer's instructions.
