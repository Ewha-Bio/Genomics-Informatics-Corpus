Homology modeling
We had attempted to model the protein structure of human FASN ER domain earlier for the purpose of understanding its bonding interactions with the known inhibitor triclosan [27]. There was a close correlation between the inhibition constant (Ki) obtained from the in silico model and the experimentally obtained biochemical IC50. However, in the present study, we implemented advanced algorithms and MD simulations to provide a more refined and highly plausible structure, with more emphasis on the catalytic active site. As discussed above, the crystal structure of Sus scrofa FASN (PDB ID 2VZ8) was used as the template to model the 3D structures of the human ER and KR domains. The pairwise sequence alignment between the template and targets were built using MODELLER 9v7. The best models for the human ER and KR domains were chosen based on the lowest DOPE score. Further, these models were found to have similar secondary structures (folds and loops) when compared with that of the template. The backbone alignment score was generated using maestro (version 9.3, Maestro, Schr√∂dinger, LLC), superimposing the respective templates. The alignment scores were found to be 0.27 for modeled human ER and 0.01 for modeled KR domain. In the postmodel development, we also compared our predicted structures with the very recently reported crystal structures of the human ER (4W82) and KR domains (4PIV) [28, 29], wherein the alignment scores were found to be 0.28 and 0.048 for modeled ER and KR, respectively. Generally, the lower alignment score (less than 0.7-0.8) is indicative of a good alignment and higher structurally identity, according to Yang and Honig [30]. Hence, taken together, all of these findings imply the predictive accuracy of the in silico methods implemented here.
The predicted structure of the human ER domain showed a Rossmann fold at region 1651 to 1794, which harbors a nucleotide binding cavity (1671 to 1688) and also overlapping substrate binding cavities at 1650-1653 and 1795-1863, as proposed by Maier et al. [16]. Similarly, the predicted structure of the KR domain showed a binding cavity at the region covering 1864 to 2117. The active cavity residue Lys1995 and the nucleotide binding residues 1886-1901 [16] were found to harbor the predicted binding cavity. The overall topology and secondary structure information of the ER and KR domains are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
