PTEN frameshift mutation identified in a breast tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). H259fs mutation is detected by the whole-exome sequencing (WES) (A) and OncoChase targeted sequencing (B) in the breast tumor. (C) The same mutation is also detected by the OncoChase targeted sequencing in the ctDNA. (D) Validation of the PTEN mutation by a digital polymerase chain reaction in ctDNA. In all experiments, the PTEN mutation was not detected in the matched normal DNA. (E) Copy number alterations identified in breast tumor or ctDNA by next generation sequencing. Amplification of FGFR1, c-MYC, CDK4, and MDM2 are detected in the tumor tissue by WES (left panel). Among them, c-MYC, CDK4, and MDM2 amplifications are consistently detected in the tumor tissue (middle panel) or ctDNA (right panel) by OncoChase targeted panel sequencing. The x-axis represents genomic position and the y-axis represents the relative depth ratio (tumor/matched normal) in log2 scale. VAF, variant allele frequency.
