Dataset
Two microarray datasets were used for this study. We acquired these datasets from a public database (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO). One was the expression dataset of 16 tumors and 4 normal tissues from 16 patients, using Affymetrix U133A gene chips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The other microarray dataset consisted of expression profiles of 22 tumors and 5 normal tissues. These two datasets were experimented on under the same platform, Affymetrix U133A. The datasets are summarized in Table 1.
