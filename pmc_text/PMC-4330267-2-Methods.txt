Structure prediction and model validation of kir6.2 (wild, mutant)
The primary sequence of kir6.2 (entry name, KCNJ11_HUMAN) was retrieved from SWISS-PROT/UniProt KB (ID, Q14654). The secondary structure of both wild-type and mutant kir6.2 was predicted using Discovery Studio 3.5. The tertiary structure prediction for kir6.2 models (both wild type and mutant) were performed using the protein fold recognition server Phyre2 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/) with 100% confidence. The predicted models were energetically minimized in ModRefiner (http://zhanglab.ccmb.umich.edu/ModRefiner/) to draw the initial starting models closer to their native state, in terms of hydrogen bonds, backbone topology, and side chain positioning. The coordinates of the predicted model of kir6.2 were submitted in Protein Model DataBase (http://bioinformatics.cineca.it/PMDB/). Structural validation was done in Procheck and Errat2 of the Saves web server (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES_3/). Protein model quality was checked in the protein structure analysis tool ProSA (http://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php). Energetically minimized structures of both kir6.2 models were visualized and superimposed in Discovery Studio 3.5.
