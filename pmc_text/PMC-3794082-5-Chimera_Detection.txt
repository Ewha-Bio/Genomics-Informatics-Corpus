Once denoising and additional quality control processes are completed, chimeric sequences should be removed from the dataset. Chimeras are artificial recombinants between two or more parental sequences, and they are normally formed when prematurely terminated fragments reanneal to other template DNA during PCR amplification [31]. These artificial molecules make it difficult to differentiate the original sequence from recombinants, resulting in overestimation of the level of microbial diversity in environmental samples [32]. Once chimeras are generated and sequenced, they need to be identified and removed from the dataset using bioinformatics tools. However, detecting chimeras is still challenging, as breakpoints can take place at any position more than once, and NGS platforms generate shorter lengths of sequences, making them hard to differentiate the source of parents with insufficient taxonomic information. Several elegant algorithms and tools have been suggested for preferentially identifying chimeric sequences in high-throughput datasets. These tools include UCHIME [15], ChimeraSlayer [16], Perseus [11], and Decipher [17]. All of these tools, except for ChimeraSlayer, use sequence frequency information to detect chimeras, assuming that chimeric sequences are less frequently represented in a given dataset than normally amplified sequences. There is no algorithm to detect chimeras perfectly, but to date, it has been known that UCHIME outperforms other algorithms, at least for short NGS reads [15]. Although there are still several limitations in detecting chimeric sequences that are formed by hybridization between closely related organisms, the tools listed above work well on SSUs and LSUs, but further validations are necessary for internal transcribed spacers and other functional genes.
