Targeted sequencing data generation
To analyze UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data, we generated targeted sequencing libraries. During library generation, UMI sequences were integrated, along with the P5 sequencing adapter. Eight libraries were pooled together into one 1.7-mL microtube, and this 8-plex pooled library was then hybridized using IDT xGen LockDown pre-designed/custom probes. Targeted sequencing data of hybrid-capture library were generated using HiSeq series by 150-bp paired-end sequencing.
