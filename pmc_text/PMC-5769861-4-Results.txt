RNA-seq
IVAG DEG analysis requires raw count RNA sequence data that can be generated using open source software, such as Htseq [14]. DEG analysis outputs a DEG results table generated with user-specified parameters based on the R Bioconductor package edgeR [15]. The output table consists of multiple columns, such as log2 fold-change, log2 count per million, associated p-value, and associated false discovery rate (Fig. 2A), and it can be visualized as a heatmap, a volcano plot, and a principal component analysis plot (Fig. 2B). The heatmap is generated using raw count data, which are converted to counts per million and normalized to a have row-based percentage value. The volcano plot is generated using log2 fold-change and the associated false discovery rate. Principal component analysis is generated using the raw count of each sample normalized to the log2 count per million. The heatmap and volcano plot can be interactively updated based on user-specified filtering criteria, such as false discovery rate or absolute fold-change. GO enrichment analysis uses the DEG analysis results table, GO annotation file, and GTF file. The DEG analysis results table can be generated using IVAG DEG analysis, or a pre-analyzed DEG analysis result can also be used. The GO annotation file consists of two columns: gene ID and GO category. A GTF file is needed to generate the gene length of each gene in the DEG analysis table. However, it can be omitted if a user wishes not to take gene length bias into account. IVAG GO enrichment analysis outputs over-represented and under-represented GO terms among DEGs (Fig. 2C) using the R Bioconductor package goseq [16]. It also shows a histogram of DEGs in each GO category based on its ontology: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function.
