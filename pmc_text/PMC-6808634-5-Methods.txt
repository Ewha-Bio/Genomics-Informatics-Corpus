Quantification of differentially expressed gene
For quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), RNA was extracted from leaves of the same plants used in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Total RNA was isolated using the same method as described for RNA sequencing. Gene expression was calculated using FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped reads). All transcripts were used to calculate its expression level and coverage. The differences in gene expression between 0B and 1B chromosome plant samples were assessed statistically by p-values; additionally, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used to determine the parameter for classification of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05). Expression values were represented by log2 ratio.
