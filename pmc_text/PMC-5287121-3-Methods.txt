Weighted SZ
Another popular method for the fixed effects model meta-analysis is calculating the weighted SZ from the follows studies. Let Zi be the z-score from study i, whichN(0,1) under the null hypothesis of no effects. Then, the weighted SZ statistic is ZSZ=∑wSZ, iZi∑wSZ, i2. (6)
By the characteristic of a normal distribution, ZSZ also follows N(0,1) under the null hypothesis. To combine z-scores from multiple studies, a per-study sample size was suggested as weights of each study, as follows [210]: wSZ, i=Ni , (7) where Ni is sample size of the study.
