Biomarker regions. Biomarker regions were illustrated in the whole-genome sequences of five different reference strains including Escherichia coli 53638, E. coli IHE3034, E. coli RN587/1, E. coli STEC B2F1, and E. coli STEC C165-02. The biomarker score (max/average) setting was used. A score of 1.0 is the maximum biomarker score, which was considered to represent a signature sequence, as indicated in green. STEC, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.
