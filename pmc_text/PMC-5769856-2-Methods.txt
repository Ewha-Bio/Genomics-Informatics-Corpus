Samples
To validate the performance of OncoChase-AS, we first tested the limit of mutation detection by using the Quantitative Multiplex Reference Standard, which contains 11 mutations across six cancer-related genes (Horizon Discovery, Cambridge, UK). Mutation detection was examined using the Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), a mixture of more than 500 Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutations across 53 genes. Four cell lines (HCT116, H1975, SW620, and HT29) were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank and used to assess the correlation with repeatability and reproducibility. To test the identification of CNAs, we used two primary tumors that are known to have CNAs, with the approval of the institutional review board of Catholic University of Korea. Genomic DNA was extracted from these samples using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
