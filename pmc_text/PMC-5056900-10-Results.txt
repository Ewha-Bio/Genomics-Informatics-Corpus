Variant interpretation
The genes were classified into two groups: likely actionable and unknown significance. The likely actionable group was confined to the genes with a mutation in NKTCL, which has previously and recurrently been identified. Three genes were classified as likely actionable: KMT2D, AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), and TP53. The other group was classified as the unknown significance groupivarious functions can be present, with molecular function potentially implied in cancer development. The variant interpretation results are summarized in Table 2. Based on their functional categories, the transcription regulation-related gene group, which included four genes related to chromatin modification, was the most common gene group (eight genes). This was followed by a group comprising five genes related to transcription factor/signal transduction.
