Validation using BAC end sequences
In order to confirm the misassembled blocks with experimental data, we extracted 41,969 pairs of end sequences from the BAC libraries (KBrS, KBrH, and KBrB) of B. rapa and carried out sequence alignment against the B. rapa reference genome sequence using Nucmer (MUMmer3.23) with the proper options (--maxmatch, use all anchor matches; -g, global alignment; -I, >95%; -r, sort output lines by reference). The Nucmer results were then filtered for discordant BAC end pairs with one end aligned to the MCB and the other end to the ADB.
