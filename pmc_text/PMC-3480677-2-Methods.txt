Patient enrollment
We enrolled 113 Korean AVB patients who were diagnosed with electrocardiograms and who had inserted permanent pacemakers and 80 normal controls with no cardiac symptoms. All patients and control subjects were recruited from four medical centers - Keimyung University, Yeungnam University, Catholic University, and Fatima Hospital (Daegu, Korea) - from August 2009 to September 2011.
This study was approved by the ethical committee at each hospital; consent was obtained from all individuals before enrollment into the study.
