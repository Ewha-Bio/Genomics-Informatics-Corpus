Long-read DNA preparation for digital data storage
To determine if our restriction and ligation conditions, we firstly optimized assay conditions with shorter fragments 490 bp, then further applied established conditions to form longer fragment with size of 1,895 bp. We confirmed the ligation product with gel electrophoresis, showing that both products were formed at the proper position of the molecular weight information (Fig. 5).
