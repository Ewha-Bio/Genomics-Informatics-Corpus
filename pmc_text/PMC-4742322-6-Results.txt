Clinical characteristics
The clinical characteristics of the fulminant T1DM cases are described in Table 1. The mean age was 36.6 ± 9.8 y, and mean body mass index was 22.0 ± 3.4 kg/m2. All participants had an HbA1c level of less than 7.0% except one patient who had HbA1c of 8.1% at initial presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis. There was absolute deficiency in insulin secretion in all of the participants and none of the participants had anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibody. The HLA-DRB1─HLA-DQB1 diplotype of the four-digit classical allele of each individual is described in Table 1. The amino acid residues at HLA-DRβ1 position 13, HLA-DRβ1 position 71, and HLA-DQβ1 position 57 are also shown in Table 1.
