Mutation analysis
The most frequently mutated genes across all samples were USP9Y and MUC5B; these genes were mutated in 5 samples. These genes were also highly mutated in each sample; for USP9Y genes, it had 6 nonsynonymous mutations in sample 3. We have selected 45 highly mutated genes (1.5%) from 2981 mutated genes. We defined highly mutated genes as genes having 3 or more nonsynonymous mutations in each sample (Table 3). In a comparison of mutations with the COSMIC database [19], among 45 highly mutated genes, 21 genes matched to hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue malignancy terms, and 21 genes matched to other cancer types. In 3 genes, there was no matched term in COSMIC (Table 4).
We used the concept lattice to construct the hierarchical relationship between the samples that had 45 highly mutated genes. Concept Biolattice analysis is a mathematical framework based on concept lattice analysis for better biological interpretation of genomic data. The top element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero concept having no object [20, 21]. For comparing with the Concept lattice (Fig. 5), we also performed hierarchical clustering analysis by Ward method. In hierarchical clustering, cluster 1 has 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10), cluster 2 has 2 samples (nos. 4 and 7), and others have 1 sample each (Fig. 6). We divided the samples into 4 subgroups by interpretation of the concept lattice result (Fig. 7). Lattice subgroup 1 shared SYNE1 gene mutation, and samples 3, 4, and 7 were included in this subgroup. Subgroup 2 was comprised of 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9) that had MUC5 gene mutations in common. Samples 10 and 8 could be isolated by the uniqueness of their mutated gene sharing pattern.
