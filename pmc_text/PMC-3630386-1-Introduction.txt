Ubiquitous heat shock proteins (HSPs) play essential roles as molecular chaperones that protect cells through protein folding as a stress response under heat shock [1]. The HSPs are well conserved in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes [2]. The HSPs are classified on the basis of their approximate molecular mass (e.g., the 70-kDa species is the Hsp70 family). DNAJ and DNAK are members of the Hsp40 and Hsp70 families, respectively [3]. These proteins are known to cooperate in many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, protein folding, protein export, and stress response in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner [4-6]. The cooperation of DNAJ and DNAK is dependent on the interactions between the J domain of DNAJ and the ATPase domain of DNAK [7].
DNAJ proteins were classified using the J, zinc finger, and carboxy-terminal domains [8]. Type I DNAJs contain all three domains, while type II proteins have a J domain linked directly to a carboxy-terminal domain without a zinc finger domain. The type III proteins include only the J domain. However, such domain architectures of DNAJ were not deliberated on most eukaryotic genome annotations, which might cause overestimation of DNAJ entries [9, 10]. Likewise, many studies of DNAKs have been used without any unified nomenclature or notation [11, 12], although ATPase and peptide-binding domains had been defined [13]. Recent classifications and identifications based on functional domains of the DNAJ/K families revealed 22, 89, and 41 DNAJs [9, 10, 14], and 14, 18, and 17 DNAKs [11, 12, 15] in the yeast, Arabidopsis, and human genomes, respectively. However, there is no informative platform that archives the previously identified DNAJ/Ks. Furthermore, only a few genomes have systematically identified DNAJ/K families, although hundreds of genomic sequences are publicly available. This problematic circumstance has demanded the development of a comprehensive platform that archives sequence information, classifies them according to their domain structures, and analyzes them using bioinformatics tools. The platform should provide user-friendly interfaces and easy access. Therefore, we developed a web-based phylogenomic platform called the Eukaryotic DNAJ/K Database (EDD).
