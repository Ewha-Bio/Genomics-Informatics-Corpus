Optimization of culture conditions: activation of the frozen pooled library
The heterozygous deletion mutant library was pooled, aliquoted into vials, and stored in a deep-freezer until use [12]. For systematic screening of target genes affected by drugs, a single vial was cultivated and treated with a drug. Cells were collected every five generations until 20 generations, and their genomic DNA was extracted for further microarray analysis. It was determined whether the frozen pooled cells should be activated for more than 1 day in order to obtain the best resolution of tag intensity. To do so, the resolution of tag intensity was compared between activated and non-activated samples (Fig. 7). When the number of up-tags (shown as curved red lines), down-tags (shown as curved blue lines), and total up/down-tags (shown as curved gray lines) were plotted against tag intensity using the same amounts of total intensity, the tag intensity of activated cells showed a better, broad distribution from 5.0 to 5.8 (right panel) in comparison to that of the non-activated cells (from 3.7 to 4.0; left panel).
