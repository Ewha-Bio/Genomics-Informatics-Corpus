Verification of candidate genes by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis
To verify the results obtained by cDNA microarray analysis, expression patterns for selected genes were confirmed at the RNA and protein levels. We selected seven genes among the 45 genes (Fig. 3A). As result of realtime RT-PCR, the expression patterns of PKCα, ITGα4, and AQP1 were identical to microarray analysis in Pkd2 KO MEF cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, 6 genes, except for TGF-β2, were identically expressed in PKD2 TG MEF cells (Fig. 3C). Especially, the AQP1 gene may be significantly regulated by differential Pkd2 gene expression level. Furthermore, to confirm the AQP1 protein expression level, western blot analysis was performed using MEF cells as well as kidney tissues obtained from Pkd2 KO (or heterozygote) and PKD2 TG mice. As result, AQP1 protein level was consistent with mRNA levels in both MEFs and tissues (Fig. 4).
