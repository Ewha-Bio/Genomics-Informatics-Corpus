Secondary structure prediction
Secondary structure was predicted by using the self-optimized prediction method with alignment (SOPMA) [11]. The protein's secondary structure includes an Î± helix, 310 helix, pi helix, beta bridge, extended strand, beta turns, bend region, random coil, ambiguous states, and other states. SOPMA predicts these properties by using homologous protein identification, sequence alignment, and conformational score determination method. Prediction accuracy was confirmed by correlation coefficient value. Plain text format data were inputted, and default parameters were set.
