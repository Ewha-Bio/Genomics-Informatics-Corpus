De novo assembly and transcriptome annotation
Low-quality reads (average quality score < 10), adapters, linkers, and polymerase chain reaction primers were removed through quality filtering. High-quality reads were assembled de novo using Oases (ver. 0.2.08) with default parameters [33]. The TransDecoder was used to identify coding regions. Unclustered transcripts and the longest sequences were considered unigenes. To identify functional transcripts, all unigenes were searched against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant database using BLASTx with an E-value threshold of 1.00E-04. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of all contigs were performed using the Blast2GO sequence annotation tool (ver. 4.0) [34]. BLAST searches and functional domain annotations were conducted using InterProScan within the Blast2GO software package.
Finally, the assembled data were arranged in terms of read length, gene annotation, GenBank number, E-value, species, and species accession number. The mRNA expression levels were calculated using the reads per kilobase of the transcriptome per million mapped reads (RPKM) method [35].
