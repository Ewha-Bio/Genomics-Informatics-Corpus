We analyzed developments in the reporting of research in 499 articles published in Genomics & Informatics from 2003 to 2018. We discussed several issues relating to article categories, word clouds, and the most studied genes. The frequency distribution of genes discussed in Genomics & Informatics resembles a power law, as a few highly popular genes were found to dominate the literature. We also categorized the published articles using interdisciplinary terminology.
