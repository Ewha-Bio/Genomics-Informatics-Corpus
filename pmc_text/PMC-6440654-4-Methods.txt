Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction
Reaction mixture for PCR (20 μL) containing 1 μL cDNA template, 500 nM each of sense and antisense primers that amplified as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, and amplification by 32 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s followed by 5 min final extension. The band intensity of PCR product was verified by electrophoresis on the agarose gel. Agarose gel stained with safe stain and band density was quantified by UV software.
The primer sequences are as following: (forward, GTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTG; reverse, TGGGTGGAATCA TATTGGA) for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and (forward, AGAAAAAGCAACCACGAAGC; reverse, AAACCTCTGTCTGTGAGTGCC) for HOTAIR.
