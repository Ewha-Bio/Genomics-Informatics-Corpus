Hierarchical clustering of molecular descriptors and dendrogram structure comparison
To test the availability of CIMVF as a molecular descriptor for the classification of AdoR ligands, a kind of molecular calculation using agglomerative hierarchical clustering was adopted in this work.
Each fingerprint or descriptor of ligands was gathered into a matrix of cognate fingerprint or descriptor. Finally, the similarity matrix, comprising descriptors of 46 ligands of AdoRs, was then subjected to hierarchical clustering in the agglomerative manner. In this study, each similarity matrix was finally clustered to make a dendrogram of 46 vertices. To compare the structures of the resulting dendrogram, we used a program for pairwise comparison of phylogenies, which shows the topological difference between two dendrograms [25]. The multiple comparison of the 5 dendrograms was also carried out using a meta-tree-generating program for comparing multiple alternative dendrograms [26].
