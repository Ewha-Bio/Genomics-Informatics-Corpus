Somatic mutations identified from the three primary colorectal cancers and corresponding patient-derived xenograft tumors. (A) Comparison of somatic mutations between patientâ€™s primary tumor (human) and xenograft tumor (xenograft). Variant allele frequencies (%) and amino acid changes are indicated in each colored box. CCA-1 (blue), CCA-2 (orange), and CCA-3 (green). (B) Respective variant allele frequencies (%) between primary (human) and xenograft tumors.
