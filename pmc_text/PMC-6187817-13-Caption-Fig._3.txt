(A–D) Comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of drug X among the different GSTM1 genotype groups. GSTM1(−/−), subject with glutathione-S-transferase M1 null function; GSTM1(−/+), subject with one glutathione-S-transferase M1 functional allele; GSTM1(+/+), subject with two glutathione-S-trans-ferase M1 functional allele; Cmax, maximum plasma concentration; AUClast, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to the last measurable concentration.
