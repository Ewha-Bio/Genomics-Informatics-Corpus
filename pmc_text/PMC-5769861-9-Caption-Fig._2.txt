Functions and results of IVAG. (A) Single-factor differential expression analysis. (B) Heatmap, volcano, and principal component analysis plot drawn with specified parameters. (C) Result of gene ontology enrichment analysis. Histogram shows how many differentially expressed genes are allocated to specific Gene Ontology categories. (D) Manhattan and quantile-quantile plots drawn with customizable options. (E) Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis generating LD matrix. (F) Pairwise LD heatmap. A group of single nucleotide polymorphisms of interest can be the subset. (G) Genome browser track with integrated view of differentially expressed gene and genome-wide association study results.
