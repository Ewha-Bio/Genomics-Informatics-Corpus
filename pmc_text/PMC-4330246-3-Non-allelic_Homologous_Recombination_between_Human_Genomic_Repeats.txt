Segmental duplication and NAHR
Genomic repeats play a significant role in human evolution and have a strong association with genomic CNVs [6, 13, 14, 15]. In 2001, Eichler [16] initially conducted a systematically bioinformatic analysis for such low-copy genomic repeats and defined them as segmental duplications (SDs), which have a high degree of sequence identity (>90%-95%) and large genomic sizes (1-100 kb). After that, Bailey et al. [17] further performed a whole-genome assembly comparison to detect SDs with pair-wise alignments ≥ 90% and ≥ 1 kb in the human genome. In addition to human SDs, the subsequent analyses also identified the SD architecture in the genomes of other primates, including chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan, and even in the mouse genome [17, 18, 19, 20], all of which have been archived in the online database of the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
LCR/SD is a very important category of DNA architecture in the human genome. It has been found that they are associated with duplicated genes and pseudogenes [21], co-localize and overlap with Alu elements and CNV [22, 23], and play an important role in genome evolution [24, 25, 26]. LCR/SD pairs, acting as substrates, are thought to be a key factor in triggering NAHR events and causing CNV mutations [4, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
Generally, reversely oriented SDs can align and subsequently crossover with each other via NAHR, resulting in copy-neutral inversions of the flanking DNA fragments (Fig. 1A). Similarly, NAHR events between direct SD pairs can cause CNVs. Based on the different positions of SD pairs, different types of CNVs occur. Duplications or deletions take place in NAHR events between different chromatids (interchromatid) (Fig. 1B), while only deletions occur in NAHR on the same chromatid (intra-chromatid) (Fig. 1C).
Based on the observations in specific pathogenic loci, SD properties (including homology length, distance, and sequence similarity) were shown to affect the incidence of NAHR [33]. In a recent study on common CNVs in human populations, it was found that SD length and inter-SD distance were the major SD properties involved in NAHR frequency [34]. A model of chromosomal compression/extension/looping has also been proposed for homology mispairing in NAHR [34].
