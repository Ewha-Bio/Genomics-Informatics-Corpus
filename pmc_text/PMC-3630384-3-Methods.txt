Formal concept analysis
We used formal concept analysis (FCA) for the construction of hierarchical relationships among samples sharing highly mutated genes [18]. FCA is a useful method in conceptual clustering of objects, attributes, and their binary relationship. In FCA, the sets of formal objects and formal attributes together with their relation to each other form a "formal context," which can be represented by a crosstable. In our case, the objects are 10 AML samples, and the attributes are 45 highly mutated genes. We defined the formal context as K = (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects (i.e., samples), M is a set of attributes (i.e., mutated genes), and I ⊆ G × M is the incidence relations where (g, m) ⊆ I if object g has attribute m. For A ⊆ G and B ⊆ M, we define the operators A' = {m ∈ M|gIm for all g ∈ A} (i.e., the set of attributes common to the objects in A) and B' = {g ∈ G|gIm for all m ∈ B} (i.e., the set of objects common to the attributes in B). A pair of (A, B) is a formal concept of k(G, M, I) if and only if A ⊆ G, B ⊆ M, A' = B, and A = B'. A is called the extent and B is the intent of the concept (A, B). The extent consists of all objects belonging to the concept while the intent contains all attributes shared by the objects. The concept of a given context is naturally ordered by the subconcept-superconcept relation, defined by (A1, B1) ≤ (A2, B2): <=> A1 ⊆ A2 (<=> B2 ⊆ B1).
The ordered set of all concepts of the context (G, M, I) is denoted by C(G, M, I) and is called the concept lattice of (G, M, I). We represent the structure of this concept lattice with a Hasse diagram, in which nodes are the concepts and the edges correspond to the neighborhood relationship among the concepts. All concepts above an object label (below the attribute label) include that object (attribute). The top element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero concept having no object.
