Trends in BioNLP and drug-related knowledge discovery
The goal of drug-related discovery is to find novel knowledge for extracting drugs, and use the newly identified drugs for disease therapy. In this review, we focused on BioNLP and tensor or matrix decomposition methods to predict novel alternative therapeutic symptoms.
Recent progress in drug-related knowledge discovery led to a couple of research trends:
(1) Well-annotated corpora are a core gold standard dataset. Annotation corpora are crucial to BioNLP, and could help to retrieve and extract information from biomedical text, and also provide standard data for repeatable training and evaluation of BioNLP.
(2) NER tasks are replaced by more complicated knowledge curation tasks, in the BioNLP community. Information from text can be extracted by BioNLP, which could be the original data to find novel knowledge through prediction models. With the recent development of PubTator, NER, and term normalization, are properly solved, while aiming to curate all of PubMed.
(3) The application of BioNLP in drug-related knowledge discovery requires deepened integration of multi-omics data. Cross-disciplinary collaboration among BioNLP, MedNLP, and bioinformatics communities is a promising approach.
(4) Knowledge inference, based on tensor or matrix decomposition, is regarded as a reliable prediction model. The integration of algorithms and theorems, developed in knowledge graphs, is a promising approach to resolve various drug-related knowledge discoveries.
