Locating guanosine next to the anticodon in tRNAs
M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL, N. hamburgensis, N. winogradskyi, and N. oceani have common conserved tRNA subsets (tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAPro) that contain a G residue at the 38th position (G37pG38) next to the anticodon. Variations of the G residue in archaea Methanococcus jannaschii tRNAs, such as tRNACys (G35pG36); tRNAHis, and tRNAArg (G36pG37); tRNAGln and tRNATry (G37pG38); tRNAArg, tRNAPro, and tRNASer (G37pG39); tRNALeu, tRNAGlu, tRNATrp, tRNASer, and tRNAPro (G39pG40) [31] are already revealed. M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL1, and N. hamburgensis share similar tRNA subsets (tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAPro) that contain a G residue at the 38th position (G37pG38) next to the anticodon (Table 1). N. winogradskyi loses the G residue in tRNAArg, but it has presented it at the 38th position in tRNAHisGTG, tRNALeuCAG, tRNALeuGAG, tRNALeuTAG, tRNAProCGG, tRNAProGGG, and tRNAProTGG. N. oceani contains conserved tRNAs (tRNAArgCCG, tRNALeuCAG, tRNALeuGAG, tRNALeuTAG, tRNAProCGG, tRNAProGGG, tRNAProTGG) in which the G residue (G37pG38) is presented next to the anticodon (Table 1). An interesting finding is that tRNAMet and tRNAPro are the only two tRNA copies that do not have a G residue at 18th position in all of these organisms (Fig. 1). Additionally, the tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAHis share common properties, except tRNAPro. But, tRNAPro has a G residue at the 18th and 38th positions in these five organisms (Fig. 2).
