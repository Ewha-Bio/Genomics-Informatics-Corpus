Confirmatory assay scheme for data storage. Two DNA molecules carrying digital information are ligated to form a longer DNA. (A) Expected size: start (35 bp) + end (35 bp) + information (54 bp) + random linker site (6 bp) = total 292 bp + 198 bp (TA cloning) = 490 bp. (B) Start signal (51 bp) + first DNA fragment (817 bp) + end signal (51 bp) + start signal (51 bp) + second DNA fragment (785 bp) + end (51 bp) + vector sequence (39 bp) = 1,845 bp.
