Comparison of search speed between two databases
Traditionally, most biological data have been stored in relational database systems. While relational database systems are useful for hierarchical and structural storage and search of various data, they may be less well suited for the storage and search of data with heavy relationships. While relational database systems can use multiple ‘joins’ to infer relationships among different tables, multiple-join operations lead to significant execution times for a query. When we compared MySQL, one of the most famous relational database systems, with Neo4j for the same kinds of data, we found that Neo4j outperformed MySQL in all tested cases. We performed a query in MySQL and Neo4j to retrieve all data belonging to a particular gene-related path in a gene, disease, and drug relationship through a 3-layer search. For the same task, we performed a MySQL query to search for the relationship between proteins that are homologous to a particular protein in a gene, protein, drug, and pathway relationship and the various nodes that traverse that protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). When the two databases (MySQL and Neo4j) were queried using the same search term, Neo4j took 2.128 s, while MySQL took 58.325 sec for a 3-layer search. For the 4-layer search, Neo4j took 20.128 s, while MySQL was unable to return a result (Fig. 7).
