Multilevel precision virtual screening and docking analysis
Three different stages of the docking and scoring processes were used for this study, beginning with HTVS, followed by SP and final scoring with XP. AMA1 protein was sequentially docked with compounds from the NCI database using Schrodinger Glide. Initially, HTVS was performed, wherein 146,670 compounds were scored as hits, based on Glide score. Subsequently, these compounds were passed to SP mode, which yielded 1,466 compounds. Finally, within the SP resultant hits, 147 compounds were scored as potential hits in XP mode. Further, these compounds were ranked in accordance with the XP docking score, and the top 10 ranking compounds proceeded to further analysis. These top 10 compounds were filtered further, based on Glide docking score, significant intermolecular interactions, and PASS prediction. Interestingly, all 10 of these compounds were found to occupy the hotspot region, which includes the hydrophobic cleft and cysteine loop region of AMA1, despite reference-guided docking procedures (Table 1).
