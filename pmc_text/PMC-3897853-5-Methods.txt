MTT assay and Trypan Blue staining
For the MTT assay, cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well on 96-well plates, and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide reagent (Sigma) was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h at 37â„ƒ in an incubator under 5% CO2, dimethyl sulfoxide was added, and absorption was measured at a wavelength of 595 nm. Viable cells were identified based on their ability to exclude the dye via Trypan Blue (Invitrogen) staining.
