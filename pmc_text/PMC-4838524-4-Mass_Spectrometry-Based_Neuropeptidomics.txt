Traditional methods of neuropeptide analysis
Traditionally, the analysis of neuropeptides was performed by Edman sequencing, in which the N-terminal amino acid is sequentially removed. The method was developed by Edman in 1950 and is used for neuropeptide sequencing in many different speciesâ€”for example, NPY in the porcine brain [20] and gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the dogfish brain [21]. However, analysis by this method is slow and does not allow for the sequencing of neuropeptides containing N-terminal PTMs [22]. Immunological techniques, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), have been used for measuring relative neuropeptide levels and spatial localization. RIA has been a popular tool to quantify neuropeptides in biological samples, such as NPY [23] and galanin in the rat brain [24]. Although RIA is a relatively sensitive technique capable of absolute quantification of peptide levels, it is not always specific for a single-peptide form because of its antibody-based detection method. In addition, unless specific antibodies are available for the different isoforms, RIAs do not distinguish between these modifications. IHC has provided essential information regarding the localization of neuropeptides within the complexity of the brain structure, improving our understanding of the distribution of peptides. However, IHC does not report the actual size or full identity of the peptide, including PTMs. In addition, these antibody-based methods require a priori knowledge of a potential neuropeptide in order to generate antibodies specific to the neuropeptides and only detect peptide sequences with known structures.
