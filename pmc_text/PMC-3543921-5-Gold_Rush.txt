After HapMap, GWAS became as easy as expected and intended; to perform a GWAS, we just collect DNA from patients, genotype it by using commercial arrays, and do a bit of statistics for the results (actually, in most cases, commercial companies do it for us as a business) (Fig. 1). Genotyping has become work, not research; commercial genotyping systems have spread all over the world. By sharing the controls, collecting controls is no longer necessary, except for diseases with extraordinary high prevalence (>10%). A huge number of susceptibility genes are mapped by this 'easy' method. As a consequence, after HapMap, as commercial genotyping systems (Illumina, etc.) have spread, the association study has spread all over the world.
As a result, a gold rush has come [1]. The study of genetic polymorphisms (SNP, copy number variation, etc.) with its application to disease studies was selected for the No. 1 scientific event in the year 2007 [12]. Naturally, the application refers to the identification of susceptibility genes for common diseases by GWAS. You must have seen (and are still seeing) so many GWAS papers in good journals, which have reported susceptibility genes for so many common diseases, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. For example, Nature Genetics is one of the top journals in the field of genetics, with an impact factor in 2010 of 36.377, and in that year, it published a total of 181 papers, of which 56% was GWAS-related. So, for the journal, the genetic study is almost equal to the association study.
There came such a big wave of medical science, and of course, we got on the wave. We did so many GWASs that were the first for diseases, including GWASs for osteoarthritis [13], rheumatoid arthritis [14], and diabetic nephropathy [15]. The big wave has also spread to East Asia. Many good GWAS papers have been published from Korea and China as fruit of this international collaboration [16-18].
