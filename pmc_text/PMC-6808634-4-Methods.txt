Transcriptome assembly, annotation, and functional analysis
After filtered raw data, we obtained clean and qualified reads (Phred quality score > 20, length > 50 bp) and the filtered clean reads were used to perform de novo assembly using Trinity program (https://github.com/trinityrnaseq). The assembled transcripts were then annotated through BLAST analysis against the NCBI nucleotide database (e-value of 1E+03). For functional annotation, we mapped transcripts onto Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases.
