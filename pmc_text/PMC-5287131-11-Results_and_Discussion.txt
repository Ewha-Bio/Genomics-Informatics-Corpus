Protein network analysis
Protein network analysis is generally used for selection of drug targets having interaction with maximum numbers of other drug targets, an efficient technique to discover a potent drug target against pathogens [34]. Here, the biological interaction was studied for 2 obtained drug targets of B. petrii, and the assessment supported for both lpxD (with lpxC, lpxB, kdsA, kdsB, lpxH, lpxK, and bpet0453) and lpxC (with lpxD, lpxB, kdsA, kdsB, lpxK, and bpet0453) proteins showing interaction with other drug targets among the chosen data set (Table 2, Fig. 4). Therefore, lpxD and lpxC proteins were strongly recommended to be potential drug targets against the pathogen B. petrii.
