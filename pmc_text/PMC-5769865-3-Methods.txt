Feature extraction by simplified amino acid alphabets
In order to investigate the effect of a particular class of amino acids on metal ion binding, the 20 amino acids were grouped into various classes based on certain common properties and the composition of the reduced sets of amino acids was considered. Feature extraction is done using the simplified amino acid alphabet. It estimates that reduced alphabets containing 10â€“12 letters can be used to design foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made.
A simplified amino acid alphabet of 18 characters was used (Table 1). It is based on three independent amino acid classifications.
Conformational similarity
Conformational similarity indices are proposed by Chakrabarti and Pal [28] based on different residues are computed using the distribution of the main-chain and side-chain torsion angles and values have been used to cluster amino acids in proteins. In this method, the conformational similarity of the 20 amino acids based on torsion angles, which contains seven clusters ([CMQLEKRA], [P], [ND], [G], [HWFY], [S], and [TIV]) are used to represent variables.
BLOSUM 50 substitution matrix
The BLOSUM-50 matrix is proposed by Cannata et al. [35]. The matrix is deduced from amino acid pair frequencies in aligned blocks of a protein sequence database and is widely used for sequence alignment and comparison. The BLOSUM 50 matrix that they group together on the basis of the possibility of foldable structures and consists of the clusters: [P], [KR], [EDNQ], [ST], [AG], [H], [CILMV], and [YWF].
Hydrophobicity
The hydrophobicity scale by Rose et al. [36] is correlated to the average area of buried amino acids in globular proteins. This results in a scale which is not showing the helices of a protein, but rather the surface accessibility. It is based on the hydrophobicity scale which consists of the following cluster: [CFILMVW], [AG], [PH], [EDRK], and [NQSTY].
