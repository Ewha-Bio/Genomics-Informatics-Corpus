Statistical analysis
The differences in allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls were assessed using chi-squared test and Fisher exact test. Three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and allele) were used to test the SNP associations. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium had been tested for all three SNPs, and their genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in our cohort. Statistical analyses were performed using PLINK [15], and p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant in all statistical analyses.
