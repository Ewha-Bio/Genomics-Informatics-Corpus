miRNA quantification in tissue
For the detection of miRNA, 2 µg of total RNA extracted from tissues was reverse transcribed into cDNA using M-MLV (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with miRNA-specific stem-loop primers, as previously described [16]. The cDNA was used for the amplification of mature miR-27a and endogenous control (U6snRNA) by real-time PCR. The real-time PCR was performed by using the SYBR Green PCR Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The PCR cycles were as follows: initial denaturation at 95℃ for 0.5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94℃ for 0.5 min, 56℃ for 1 min, 72℃ for 0.5 min. The relative miRNA expression level was calculated using the delta Ct (ΔCt) method.
