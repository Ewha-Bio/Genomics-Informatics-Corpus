Subjects
The study was approved and conducted by the Korean Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) from November 1, 2006 to July 31, 2008. Three local clinical centers and 10 hospitals were recruited for this work. Photographs for facial analysis were taken by trained investigators according to a standard protocol. To ensure the quality of the photographs, we took 2 facial pictures from both the front and the lateral side of each subject and selected the better representative pictures for the analysis. During the first and second phase of this survey, 114 and 164 individuals were collected, respectively. Subjects with poor-quality photographs were excluded from analysis. The study included a total of 229 individuals from 38 families, and of these, one family had a large extended pedigree. All samples were of Korean origin. Anyone who had a facial anomaly or surgery was excluded in this study. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of parents' age were 55.2 and 13.9, and those of the offspring's age were 36.0 and 17.4, respectively.
