tRNA m1G37 methyltransferase (TrmD)
Lots of modified nucleosides are present at the region of anticodons, specifically at positions 34 (the wobble position) and 37 (3' and adjacent to the anticodon). One of them is the 1-methyl guanosine (m1G) modification occurring at position 37 in tRNA [22]. This modification is catalyzed by TrmD, which catalyzes the addition of a methyl group from AdoMet to G at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon [23]. The specificity of this enzyme is determined by V, T, and D side loops and the presence of a G36pG37 sequence [24]. TrmD is a vital enzyme for maintaining the correct reading frame during translation [25]. Lack of this modification at the 37th position (i.e., next to the anticodon) leads to a +1 frameshift and hinders the translation efficiency [26]. The nucleus-encoded tRNA is methylated at G before being transported to the cytoplasm, whereas in mitochondria, the tRNA is methylated at G37 by a nucleus-encoded enzyme and transported into organelles [27]. Both TrmH and TrmD enzymes are under the class of the SpoU family and share similar catalytic reactions [28]. Hence, the study confirms that tRNA subsets contain G bases at the 18th position (D-loop) and next to the anticodon (anticodon loop).
