Protein structure modeling
We have examined protein features related to residues substituted by the identified 27 somatic mutations and found the features of 19 mutations (Table 3). The mutation of CEBPA generates a duplication of an amino acid that affects the original helical secondary structure. The residue corresponding to the mutation of IDH2 has a function to bind with its substrate, so the substitutions of the residue decrease the binding affinity with the substrate. The protein region frame-shifted by the mutation of NPM1 is related to the function of nuclear localization, important for maintaining the structure. The structural modeling of RASGEF1B shows that the mutated residue Arg261 generates a new hydrogen bond with Asn303, affecting the stretch of neighbor helical structures. The protein structure of MSH4 shows that the salt bridge between Glu415 and Arg474 is essential for the folding and stability of the protein structure but is broken by the mutation (Table 4, Fig. 11).
