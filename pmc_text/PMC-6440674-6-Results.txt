We directly investigated whether our HMMs based on invariable units have the discriminating power against control datasets of highly variable units. As these HMMs could be used as a binary Naive Bayes classifier, we calculated the sequence of each 200-bp unit that maximized our Markov models. For each chromatin state, the given HMM tries to capture the statistical differences in the two hidden states of ‘H’ (High) and ‘L’ (low). As was shown in Fig. 3; based on nucleotide frequency profiles and given a random sequence x1,x2, … ,xn, we calculated sequences π1, π2, … ,πn of chromatin states that maximized the probability between highly-variable and invariable states, for the 15 × 2 Hidden Markov models.
Table 2 shows the prediction accuracy for the 15 chromatin states. We defined a correctly predicted unit as one when predicted results matched the dominant chromatin state of annotations of each of the testing units against control datasets or highly-variable units.
According to Table 2, HMM trained from invariable 1_TssA-dominant units shows the highest prediction accuracy of 85.3%. Investigating the dynamics of chromatin state conversions of highly variable units, we found that most significant state switches are between active states. Among eight active chromatin states, the order of prediction accuracy can be sorted as follows.
1 _ TssA > 2 _ TssAFlnk > 6 _ EnhG > 7 _ Enh > 3 _ TxFlnk > 8 _ ZNF / Rpts > 4 _ Tx > 5 _ TxWk
Among seven inactive chromatin states, 10_TssBiv and 11_BivFlnk, and 12_EnhBiv showed a high precision rate above 90%.
These results and additional properties of the model suggest that n-grams related to invariant chromatin regions are an inherent and biologically-informative feature of the genome. The framework enables us to infer about coordinated differences in marks by studying chromatin state variability of 200-bp units.
