Bioactive neuropeptide synthesis. Adopted from Fricker et al. Mass Spectrom Rev 2006;25:327-344, with permission of John Wiley and Sons [6]. A hypothetical precursor is shown to contain typical processing sites of Lys-Arg (KR), Arg-Arg (RR), or R-Xn-R, where n = 2, 4, or 6. First, a signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum removes the N-terminal signal peptide, and the precursor is routed to the Golgi apparatus and packaged into dense-core secretory vesicles. The prohormone convertase 1, 2, or 5A cleaves the precursor to produce intermediates that contain C-terminal K and/or R residues. Those basic residues are removed by carboxypeptidase E (or D). After removal of the basic residues, peptides with a C-terminal glycine are typically converted to the amide by peptidyl-glycine Î±-amidating monooxygenase. In addition, a number of other post-translational modifications (PTMs), including N-terminal acetylation, phosphorylation, and pyroglutamylation, have been reported.
