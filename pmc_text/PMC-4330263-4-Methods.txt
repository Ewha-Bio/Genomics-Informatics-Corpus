The generalized least squares for the BLUP
We used the "rrBLUP" package for calculating the G matrix and predicting the genetic values of men's height complex traits. "rrBLUP" uses a practically generalized least squares (GLS) solution for the BLUP. For the G-BLUP, we used the G matrix, which was calculated from the R "rrBLUP" package using information on 35,675 SNPs. For the random effects estimation, such as SNP effects, we used two methods. One was SNP-BLUP, which is assumed to be IID between SNPs, and the other was SNP-GBLUP, which uses the statistical SNP-SNP variance covariance matrix. We will call this the SNP-SNP relationship matrix. (7) (8)
