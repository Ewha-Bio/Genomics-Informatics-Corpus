Restriction and ligation
3A assembly-associated enzymes were used: Xba1 (cat. no. R013S; Enzynomics, Daejeon, Korea) for the cut of the first restriction site and Spe1 (cat. no. R011S; Enzynomics) for the second. The cohesive DNA strand was ligated with AccuPower Ligation PreMix (cat. no. K-7103; Bioneer). The two DNA fragments were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and incubated ON at 4Â°C.
