Experimental results from high-throughput technologies, such as the two-hybrid screening system for detecting interactions between biological molecules, have formed various types of network datasets that are released and updated in public databases on the web. These databases commonly enable web-based searches and provide raw datasets of pairs of molecules. In this review, we report 11 useful public databases for PPIs and transcriptional regulatory interactions (Table 1) [10-20]. For PPIs, BioGRID [13], MIPS [11], and STRING [16] are the most frequently used to predict protein functions for PPIs. BioGRID provides 496,761 non-redundant PPIs for various species, ranging from yeast S. cerevisiae to human. On the other hand, MIPS not only provides mammalian PPIs but also offers the functional catalogs that contain descriptions of protein functions. Unlike BioGRID and MIPS, STRING contains identified and predicted functional interactions of proteins with functional similarity scores (i.e., STRING offers weighted networks). For transcriptional regulatory interactions, transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) [19] offers GRNs and transcriptional factors for three species; human, mouse, and rat. On the other hand, RegulonDB [20] contains both experimental datasets and computational prediction results of transcriptional regulatory interactions for the Escherichia coli K-12 organism.
