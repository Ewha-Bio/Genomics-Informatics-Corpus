Genotyping, quality control, and imputation
A total of 10,004 DNA samples were genotyped with the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Genotypes were called by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) algorithm [20]. The quality score criteria and procedures have been described in a previous GWAS [19]. After each step of the quality control, genotypes from 8,842 individuals with a total of 352,228 markers were left and used for the association analysis. In this study, we additionally excluded 257 individuals taking medication that influenced BMD levels.
SNP imputation was conducted using the IMPUTE2 program [21]. The 1000 Genomes Phase I integrated haplotypes (released in Dec 2013), produced using SHAPEIT2 in NCBI build 37 coordinates, were used as the reference panel [22]. All 1,092 individuals with 36.8 million SNPs were initially utilized, and haplotypes with singleton sites were removed. Since there is no X chromosome in the current version of the reference panel, a previous version (released in Mar 2012) was used as the reference panel for the X chromosome.
Because the previous GWAS was based on NCBI build 36, SNP positions should be converted to build 37 coordinates by using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) liftOver tool [23]. SNP orientations were aligned to the forward strand using PLINK [24]. In order to improve the performance of the SNP imputation, SNPs were pre-phased by SHAPEIT2 [22, 25]. Then, SNPs were imputed directly onto the haplotype estimates by IMPUTE2. Imputation was carried out for the regions within 500 kb on either side of 64 SNPs reported in the previous GWAS [18]. SNPs with a minor allele frequency < 0.01 and imputation quality score (INFO) < 0.4 were filtered out. Then, we combined 51 imputed SNPs with 9 directly typed KARE SNPs for association analyses.
