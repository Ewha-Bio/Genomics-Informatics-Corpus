In this paper, we investigated the optimal characteristics of two fixed effects meta-analysis methods: the inverse variance-weighted average and the weighted SZ. We showed that the two methods are optimized with different goals, but they are equivalent under certain assumptions. By analytical derivations and empirical simulations, we demonstrated their equivalency and provided insights into the optimal weights for the weighted SZ.
We have also shown that the optimal weights for the weighted SZ can be a function of not only the sample size but also other propertiesâ€”for example, allele frequencies in GWASs. We empirically showed that if allele frequencies differ between studies, using only sample size for the weight can be suboptimal in terms of power. Therefore, we suggest that one should use effect size and standard error to define a z-score and use the inverse of the standard error as the weight for the weighted SZ. The standard error term includes all information, such as sample size and allele frequencies, thus providing optimal performance. Nevertheless, in our simulations, using just sample size resulted in only slightly lower power (at most, 1.07% power loss). Thus, in most applications, using only sample size for weights might perform reasonably well.
We also demonstrated that in some situations, the two meta-analysis methods can give different results. Specifically, when one study used the linear mixed model to account for population structure, the effect size from the linear mixed model can be incompatible with the effect size from the logistic regression model. In such situations, the use of meta-analysis methods based on z-scores or p-values is recommended, because it is not sensible to apply inverse variance-weighted average to multiple incompatible effect sizes from different statistical models.
