Significant putative conserved domains and superfamilies
In the era of modern vaccines, finding conserved domains or epitopes has a great therapeutic value. Putative conserved domains were described as non-specific hits (NH), specific hits (SH), and multi-domains (MD), and it was shown in Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
The putative conserved domains and superfamilies that were associated with some signature proteins are shown below.
