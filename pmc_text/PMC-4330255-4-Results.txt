Genome-wide association studies
Table 3 summarizes 20 SNPs that were top-ranked by p-value in the genome-wide association analysis. Unfortunately, there were no significant SNPs that met p < 5 Ã— 10-8. We performed logistic regression test on the top-ranked SNPs, and we took 10 SNPs in Table 4. Logistic regression measures the relationship between a categorical dependent variable (phenotype) and one or more independent variables (SNPs). Fig. 1 shows the ROC plot for the classification test using the 10 SNPs. The AUC value from the ROC plot is 0.700; it is not enough as a biomarker.
