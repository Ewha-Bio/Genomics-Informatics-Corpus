Statistical analyses
PLINK version v1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink) was used to perform the association analysis, and the hypertension case control study was tested by logistic regression analysis. The association tests were based on an additive genetic model and adjusted for recruitment area, age, sex, and body mass index.
