Radial tree of corralled intensity of molecular vibrational frequency (CIMVF) clustering using the complete linkage method. Antagonists are tagged with "t" to their chemical names as a prefix, whereas agonists are not. Agonists of histamine receptors except impromidine are located in a cluster (the part in the dotted circle).
