BLAST
BLAST was done with sequences for each of the five reference strains by using NCBI BLASTX (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to identify the putative protein domains. Furthermore, putative conserved domains were also detected. The results were confirmed using the Uni-ProtKB Bank BLASTX program (http://www.uniprot.org/blast/).
