Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
qRT-PCR was performed to verify the expression value of nine DEGs. For data normalization, GAPDH gene expression was used as an internal reference. All samples were individually analyzed for three biological replicates. PCR was conducted using SYBR Green fluorescent dye in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Reaction mixture was prepared using Thunderbird SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Japan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cycling conditions were as follows: 95℃ for 1 min, 40 cycles of 95℃ for 15 s, 60℃ for 1 min. Melting curves for PCR products were analyzed under the following conditions: 95℃ for 15 s, cooling to 60℃ for 1 min, and then gradual heating at 0.1℃/s to a final temperature of 95℃. The qRT-PCR data were analyzed using 2-ΔΔCt method. Mean and standard deviations were calculated with triplicate data from three independent biological replicates. Primer information used in this study was described in Supplementary Table 1.
