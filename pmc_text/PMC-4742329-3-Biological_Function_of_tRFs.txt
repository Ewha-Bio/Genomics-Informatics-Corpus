Are tRFs merely by-products of tRNA degradation or nuclease off-target effects? Or do they have bona fide biological functions? If they do have functions, how diverse are these functions? Several lines of evidence have identified their regulatory targets, supporting that they are functional molecules [31343537]. Although the exact roles of tRFs are further to be elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that they participate in two main types of biological processes as discussed in more detail below (Fig. 2).
