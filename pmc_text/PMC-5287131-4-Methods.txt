Protein-protein network study
The putative drug targets of B. petrii obtained after pathway analysis were subjected for protein-protein network analysis using STRING (http://string-db.org/) web server. Here, the interaction between the drugs targets were quantified on the basis [34] of confidence value (0.007) and the level of interaction (maximum as 50). The drug targets observed as having higher numbers of interaction with other drug targets among the chosen data sets were considered for further analysis (Fig. 1B).
