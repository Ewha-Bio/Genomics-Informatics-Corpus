Data
The KARE project, which began in 2007, is an Anseong and Ansan regional society-based cohort. After applying SNP quality control criteria—Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p < 10−06, genotype call rates < 95%, and minor allele frequency < 0.01—352,228 SNPs were utilized for analysis. Also, after eliminating 401 samples with call rates less than 96%, 11 contaminated samples, 41 gender-inconsistent samples, 101 serious concomitant illness samples, 608 cryptic-related samples, and 4 samples with missing phenotype, 8,838 participants were analyzed [23]. Table 1 summarizes the demographic information. In addition, Fig. 1 shows box plots of BMI for the given demographic variables.
