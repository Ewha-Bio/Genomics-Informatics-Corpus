As a first step toward NC serodiagnosis, an extensive study to determine the applicability of ELISA employing TsM CF as an antigen was carried out using paired samples of serum and CSF from patients with NC. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 90.1% and 88.5%, respectively. CSF showed greater sensitivity. This result demonstrated that a serological test using paired samples of serum and CSF was highly beneficial for differentiating NC from other causes of organic brain diseases [20].
To establish the appropriate diagnostic criteria, the specific antibody levels were measured in 1:100 diluted serum (in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) and undiluted CSF samples from 355 patients with several neurological diseases, including NC. The positive criterion was set as the low limit of the positive reaction, which was also the mid-point of the absorbance range of the lowest frequency in serum samples used in the blind test [20]. Considering that the amount of specific IgG might be 1/100 of the amount in serum [27], the same positive criterion could be applied for CSF samples. Detection of specific antibody levels by ELISA either in serum or in CSF, thereafter, became the main mode of NC serodiagnosis. IgG subclass responses demonstrated that sera from patients with NC reacted mainly with the IgG4 subclass [28].
