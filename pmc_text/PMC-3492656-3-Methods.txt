Breeds/populations descriptions
The Danakil cattle breed is grouped under Sanga and originated in East and Northeast Africa, where Sanga cattle evolved. The Horro breed was formed as a result of interbreeding between zebu-Sanga and Sanga-zebu admixture populations. The large-sized Borana breed descended from secondary cattle domestication in the arid areas of the 'Fertile Crescent' about 5000 BP [7]. The breed is predominantly distributed in arid and semi-arid agro-ecologies of the Borana plateau. The small-sized Arsi cattle probably developed from a group of small short-horned Abyssinian zebu by the highland Oromo people. The Ambo cattle is grouped under Small East African zebu and is believed to have descended from the recent introductions of zebu into Africa [8]. Pictures of sampled animals are depicted in Fig. 2.
