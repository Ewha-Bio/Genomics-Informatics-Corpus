Neuron-related terms in the GO analysis
It was reported that neuronal genes are closely related to fat accumulation [4]. Lee et al. [4] used local genomic sequencing and SNP association to identify genes for subcutaneous fat thickness. They reported that NEGR1, SLC44A5, PDE4B, LPHN2, ELTD1, ST6GALNAC5, and TTLL7 are fat-associated neuronal genes. However, in our analysis, these genes did not appear. This may be because the aforementioned study used Korean native pig. We examined BF in Korean Landrace pigs. Despite this difference, neuron-related terms were also major ones in our analysis. In Yorkshire pigs, neuronal genes were also found. The neuronal genes ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2 were not yet reported. In our study, these genes reported in the GWAS of pigs but they have been reported in GWASs of cattle, chickens, and sheep.
