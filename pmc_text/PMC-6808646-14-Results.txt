Summary of available bar-codes
Initially, 4,526 strains in total were pooled and entered into the optimization process. However, the bar-codes of 85 strains were eliminated due to the possibility of cross-hybridization, because they harbored a sequence similarity longer than 15 bp with each other by chance. This left 4,441 strains for further analysis. In addition, 125 strains showing noisy intensity for up-tags and/or down-tags were also eliminated, because they showed the intensity less than 4Ã— background signals. Finally, 4,316 strains were proven to be useful for the microarray, as they were represented at least once among the up-tags and/or down-tags. In particular, 3,706 strains were represented by both tags, 4,072 strains by up-tags only, and 3,950 strains by down-tags only.
