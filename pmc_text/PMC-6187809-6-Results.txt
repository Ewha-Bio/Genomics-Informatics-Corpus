Histological features of primary and PDX tumors
All of the PDX tumors used in this study were passage-three tissues. The three primary tumors showed adenocarcinomas of the colon, and the histological features of the tumor tissues of the PDX models from the same CRC patients were identical (Fig. 1). The tumor cell purity of the primary tumor tissues and xenograft tumor tissues was comparable, but the xenografts showed slightly higher purity than primary CRCs (all >60%).
