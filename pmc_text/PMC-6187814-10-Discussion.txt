Actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphogenesis genes
Among the actin cytoskeleton organization genes and cell morphogenesis genes, PCDH15, NGFR, DTNBP1, and BAIAP2 are also neuronal genes and thus can be classified into the GO terms of neuronal genes. These genes obviously play a role as neuronal genes, actin cytoskeleton organization genes (BAIAP2 gene) and cell morphogenesis genes (PCDH15, NGFR, and DTNBP1 genes). These genes not only play a role as neuronal genes but also act as actin cytoskeleton organization and cell morphogenesis genes. Interestingly, these neuronal genes are associated with brain function, nerves and diseases. Thus, some of the backfat-associated genes play a neuronal role. We expect that how backfat and neuronal genes or neuropathic genes are related to each other will be revealed.
