Between-block relationship
Once we conducted GCCA in SAS/IML, we could get information on the canonical variables and coefficients for each variable in the block. From the canonical variable value, we calculated the correlation between blocks, because the first and second canonical variables could represent most of the data. Table 3 represents the correlation between each block’s canonical variables. With a GCCA containing three blocks, the first correlation among three blocks is obviously high, but it can be different when we consider two pairs. The highest relationship was found in group 1, which had a correlation of 0.281 between the SNP block’s second canonical variable and the phenotype block’s second canonical variable. It is interesting that the relationship between the SNP block and phenotype block is the strongest, while the relationship between the SNP block and disease block is not that noticeable. This would imply a pathway relationship from SNP to disease, in which phenotype is the medium of the link between them. Another interesting point is the relationship between the first canonical variables is not that strong in the relationship between SNP and phenotype. Except group 4, the other three groups showed a stronger correlation between second canonical variables than first canonical variables. This is thought to be due to the fact that the phenotype spreads in the second axis.
We also visualized the relation between blocks, particularly between the second canonical variables of the SNP and phenotype blocks. In Fig. 3, we illustrate a sample plot in group 3. The plot explains how the sample observation is located in each block by using the first and second canonical variable of each block. The SNP block appeared to be scattered compared with the other groups. The phenotype block’s observations are densely populated near the center (0,0), while the disease group’s observations only appear at four dots, since they are discrete data that have four possible disease cases. We can regard a sample that is located farther from center (0,0) is more influential for each SNP, phenotype, or disease block.
