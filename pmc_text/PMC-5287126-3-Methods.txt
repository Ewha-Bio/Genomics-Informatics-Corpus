Association test for identification of genome-wide sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana
In order to discover genome-wide sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana, we carried out an association test using the IVAS package [9]. For each exon with at least two isoforms, IVAS tested associations between the alternatively targeted exon and the genotype of SNPs located in the exon and flanking introns. We filtered the result based on a cutoff at false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.01 and median values of exon ratio across each genotype > 0.1.
