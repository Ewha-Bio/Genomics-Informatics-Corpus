Sequencing and library construction
cDNA libraries from each sample were prepared using Truseq mRNA library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a library size of 500 bp. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq3000 with paired-end method. Raw data were deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the following accession numbers: SRR8316493 and SRR8316494.
