Genome-wide association studies
The commercial pig breeds in Korea are mainly the Landrace, Yorkshire, Duroc and Berkshire breeds. Among these breeds, we analyzed GWASs of backfat thickness using the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds. Although there is a pig QTL database (QTL DB, https://www.animalgenome.org) associated with BF, we aimed to determine the significant variants and those containing genes by using the Korean pig population. While the QTL DB provides much information about QTL and significant genes, detailed information about the significant genes is not available. Thus, a GWAS should be performed with the QTL information.
