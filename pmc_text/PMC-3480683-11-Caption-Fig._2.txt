Effect of the interaction of rs271, which was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs263 (r2 = 0.99), with cigarette smoking on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) (A) and triglyceride (TG) (B) levels (p = 5.7 × 10-3 and p = 8.60 × 10-3, respectively). Subjects were divided into non-smokers (TT or TC, 1,629; CC, 2,689) and smokers (TT or TC, 700; CC, 1,289). Interaction p-values were calculated by linear regression analyses, which includes main and interaction effects, adjusted for residence area, age, gender, and body mass index.
