Subgroup analysis by concept lattice. (A) Subgroup 1 shares SYNE1 mutation in samples 3, 4 and 7. (B) Subgroup 2 shares MUC5B mutation in samples 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9. (C) Subgroup 3 sample 8 only has mutated genes, such as MUC2 and HELZ2. (D) Subgroup 4 has sample 10, having only mutated genes, like MUC6, CDH23, BRD2, OR6V1, and DNAH17.
