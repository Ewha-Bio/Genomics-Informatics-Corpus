HSF estimation
We estimated HSF of Hanwoo and Holstein. The HSF of Hanwoo and Holstein were 351 ± 46 (mean ± SD) and 279 ± 39 (mean ± SD), respectively. The Holstein HSF was not greater than that of Hanwoo because the Holstein HSF might pertain only to the history of Korean Holsteins. Fig. 1 shows the number of SNPs across chromosomes in Hanwoo and Holstein. The difference in the number of SNPs across chromosomes might be mainly due to the number of individuals i.e., 23 and 10 in Hanwoo and Holstein, respectively.
