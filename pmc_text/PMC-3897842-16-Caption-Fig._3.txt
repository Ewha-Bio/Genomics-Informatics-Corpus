Epigenetic silencing is more frequent that mutations in cancer cells. In cancer cells, hundreds to thousands of genes are hypermethylated (DNA methylation), histone codes at more than thousands of genes are aberrantly modified via histone modifications or histone variant compositions, and miRNA expression is dysregulated, while tens of genes are affected by mutations. Both epigenetic silencing and inactivating mutations or deletions result in gene inactivation.
