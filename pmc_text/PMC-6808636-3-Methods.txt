SNP quality control and filtration
In the WTCCC dataset, 4,351 SNPs had already been excluded based on a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test threshold of p < 5.7 × 10-7 in the combined set of 2,938 controls, as well as 93 SNPs with p-values < 5.7 × 10-7 from either a one- or two-degrees of freedom test for differences between the two control groups.
In this analysis, we only focused on autosomal variants (459,059 SNPs). We further performed additional SNP quality control (QC) ﬁlters. We removed SNPs that showed a genotype failure rate greater than 0.05, SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%, and SNPs with an HWE p < 0.00001. After applying these QC criteria to the combined control cohort, we obtained 358,085 SNPs.
