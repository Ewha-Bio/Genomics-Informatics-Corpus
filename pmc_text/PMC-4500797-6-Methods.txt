Trans-QTL analysis
Sixty-three human samples were commonly present in the RNA-seq [5] and DNase-seq [8] data, and 96 yeast segregants in the microarray and FAIRE-seq data. Therefore, we used the common samples for our QTL mapping. Linear regression was carried out leading to 2,100,341 chromatin associations and 975,333 expression associations in human, and 110,802 chromatin linkages and 164,217 expression linkages in yeast at p < 0.01. Genetic markers farther than 200 kb from the nearest gene in human and 100 kb in yeast were identified to examine regulatory relationships acting in trans. For each trait (gene or accessible chromatin region) and regulatory locus (genetic marker), the number of associations or linkages was obtained and divided by the total number of associations at a given p-value.
