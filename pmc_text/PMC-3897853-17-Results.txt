Global expression analysis and involvement of SNTB2 in radioresistance
A cDNA microarray was used to analyze DEGs in H460R cells in response to IR. Four hundred genes that were either up-regulated or down-regulated, demonstrating more than 2-fold changes in H460R cells, are categorized in Table 1, which is shown to summarize the enriched gene ontology terms of the selected gene set. Among up-regulated genes in response to IR, we focused on genes listed in the 'plasma membrane' category among the cellular components categories. In addition to being a membrane adapter protein, SNTB2 was modulated by interaction with MRP2 [24], a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily, functioning as an ATP-dependent export pump for anionic conjugates in the apical membranes of epithelial cells. Since ABC proteins have been implicated in resistance [25, 26], SNTB2 was selected for further analysis to evaluate whether it is involved in radioresistance. Consistent with the microarray data, protein levels of SNTB2 in H460 cells were highly increased in response to IR compared to the parental cells (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of SNTB2 by siRNA sensitized H460R cells as well as the parental cells to IR (Fig. 4B and 4C), although the effect of si-SNTB2 on H460R was less compared with parental cells. SNTB2 expression levels were examined in other NSCLC cell lines to determine whether A549 and H1299 cells expressed high levels of SNTB2 compared with H460 cells and H1299, which are more resistant to IR exposure (Fig. 5A). We verified that knockdown of SNTB2 by siRNA made H1299 cells more sensitive to IR exposure (Fig. 5B and 5C), suggesting that SNTB2 plays a role in radioresistance.
