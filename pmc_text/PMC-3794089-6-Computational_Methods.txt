Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
ROC curve analysis illustrates the accuracy of a binary classifier with graphical representation of the specificity and sensitivity with varying threshold for the discrimination of true and false pairs on a plot. After setting a threshold for the delineation of positive and negative classes, true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) are defined. The sensitivity, or true positive rate (TPR), and specificity, or true negative rate (TNR), are defined as follows:
,
while numerical ROC values are also defined as follows:
where Ti signifies the number of true positives ranked ahead of the ith false positive. An ROC curve was drawn following these calculations. To draw the curve, the thresholds are varied from the ones for the most sensitive discrimination, where all predictions are positive, to the one for the most specific discrimination, where all predictions are negative. A good classifier would show high sensitivity and high specificity concurrently. The more accurate classifier displays an earlier and steeper increase of the curve, while a less accurate classifier displays a less steep increase in the lower left region. Thus, the area under the curve could possibly signify the accuracy of the classifier. Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was calculated using approximations of the curve, with a grid width of 0.01.
