Molecular surface area of the enoyl reductase domain. (A) Red region shows the Rossmann fold; yellow region shows the nucleotide binding residues, and the blue region shows the two donor residues for protonation of the substrates (Lys1771 and Asp1797). (B) Depicts the tunnel through which the substrate moves into the next domain.
