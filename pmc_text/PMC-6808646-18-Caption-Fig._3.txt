Optimization of the annealing temperature for PCR amplification of bar-code tags. To amplify the bar-code tags, the following sets of primers were used for PCR with 0.2 μg of genomic DNA as a template; UP tag, forward (5′U-2) 5′-GCTCCCGCCTTACTTCGCAT-3′, reverse (biotin-Kan5′U-2) 5′-biotin-CGGGGACGAGGCAAGCTAA-3′; DN tag, forward (DN3-F-biotin) 5′-biotin-GCCGCCATCCAGTGTCG-3′, reverse (DN3-R) 5′-TTGCGTTGCGTAGGGGGG-3′. To obtain the optimal PCR conditions, a series of PCR experiments were performed at the indicated annealing temperatures (52℃, 54℃, 56℃, and 58℃), followed by resolution on a 10% acrylamide gel with a size marker (SM, 100-bp DNA ladder from Bioneer). The arrows in white represent extra bands, and the arrow in black represents the position of amplified tag bands (~70 bp).
