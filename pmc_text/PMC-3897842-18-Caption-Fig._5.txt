Interactions of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) with a diversity of proteins and its possible roles (references in parentheses). The putative cellular functions of protein-protein interactions of HP1 are shown in circles. Some of their biological significance is not yet clarified. Only the proteins that have been shown to interact with HP1 in vivo are listed here.
