General patterns of gene signature in single-ligand studies
We first characterized gene expression profiles after treating RAW 264.7 macrophages with the individual ligands in a kinetic study (60 and 120 min). We found that each of the three ligands, when applied singly, exhibited maximum transcriptional activation after 120 min of stimulation (as analyzed by Limma) (Fig. 1A). We further explored the expression data using k-means/medians clustering (KMC) in MeV, in which we divided the gene expression profiles into clusters in order to identify groups of genes that might participate in similar pathways. The clusters that exhibited changes greater than 2-fold are shown in Fig. 1B. Upon single-ligand treatment, KDO and IFN-Î² mediated robust transcriptional upregulation, whereas 8-Br stimulation resulted in both up- and downregulation of gene expression. The top-most functions of the genes by all ligand treatment and major networks are given in Fig. 2.
