Partial purification of 120 and 150 kDa macromolecular proteins from TsM CF. (A) A 1.6 × 60 cm long FPLC packed with Superdex 200 prep grade was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl. A total of 3 mL (10 mg) of TsM CF was applied to the column with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Eighty-five fractions (1.5 mL each) were analyzed for their absorbance at 280 nm, as monitored by UNICORN (v3.0). (B) Analysis of the eluted group III and IV proteins by native PAGE. (C) Western blot analysis of the fraction III and IV proteins probed with anti-CF antibody. TsM, Taenia solium metacestode; CF, cyst fluid; FPLC, fast-performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Mr, molecular weights in kDa; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
