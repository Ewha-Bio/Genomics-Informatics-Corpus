Establishment and maintenance of stable cell lines
Human COX-2 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector containing neor. U2OS cells were transfected with COX-2 or pcDNA3 DNA using Lipofectamine2000 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Transfectants were selected in the presence of geneticin, and individual clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 units/mL), and geneticin (700 Âµg/mL), as reported previously [14].
