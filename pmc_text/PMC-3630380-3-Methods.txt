Sample preparation
All blood samples were stored at -80℃ for the handling of human genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was purified using G-DEX blood genomic DNA (gDNA) purification kits (Intron Biotechnology Inc., Seongnam, Korea).
The gDNA for the discovery analysis was quantified using the picogreen dsDNA quantification reagent following a standard protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The plates were read using a VICTOR3 1420 Multilabel counter (excitation 480 nm, emission 520 nm; PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and a standard curve for gDNA concentration was generated using known concentrations of lambda DNA.
The quality of the gDNA analyzed in the replication stage was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo, Eugene, OR, USA). Genomic DNA was diluted to a concentration of 10 ng/µL in 96-well PCR plates.
