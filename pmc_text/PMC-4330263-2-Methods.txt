Data preparation
We used the Ansan-Anseong cohort dataset in Korea. This dataset was established for a Korean chronic diseases study, with Ansan and Anseong representing urban and rural areas of Korea, respectively. The subjects were men between 40-69 years of age who had been residents of the region for at least 6 months. The basic survey was conducted from 2000 to 2001, and our study was based on the 3rd Ansan-Anseong cohort dataset version 2.1. We chose height as the phenotypic data and sex as a fixed effect. The SNPs of the cohort dataset were implemented using Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mean call rate was 99.01%, and the genetic analysis result, proved by SNPstream UHT 12 plex, was 99.934%. The total number of genotyped SNPs was 352,228, and they were filtered using the conditions of minor allele frequency (MAF; <0.01), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<0.0001), and missing genotyping (missing >0.2). The SNPs were pruned using PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink), leaving 35,675 SNPs for the analysis of human height; 997 individuals were involved in the analysis.
The GRM was calculated by using R package "rrBLUP" with the option "Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm." Then, using the restricted maximum likelihood method (REML) of the same packages, we calculated the SNP effects, genetic values, error variance, and genetic value variance. The EM imputation algorithm was used for the GRM, because we dealt with high-density SNPs. The REML method is used in a rather small size sample instead of the ML method.
