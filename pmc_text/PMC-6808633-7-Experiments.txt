Materials
For our experiments, we use the current source code of CONTES (https://github.com/ArnaudFerre/CONTES), and datasets and the OntoBiotope ontology from the BB normalization task of the BioNLP Shared Task 2016. We also downscaled word embeddings computed from a reduced corpus (40,000 words), in order to speed up the experimental cycle.
