Significant difference between clinical age information and predicted age using a DNA methylation age calculator
Recently, several studies have shown that DNA methylation markers can be used to estimate the age of an individual to within 5 y [17]. Because the datasets we analyzed had age information, as well, we tested whether the given age information deviated much from the estimated age from age-specific DNA methylation markers. The age prediction was performed by using the DNA methylation age calculator, a web-based tool that provides a predicted age based on the methylation values of DNA methylation markers of Illumina's Infinium platform [18]. When we compared the absolute age deviation between concordant and discordant samples, we found much larger deviations in age prediction among discordant samples compared with concordant samples (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5). This result suggests that the discordant samples are highly likely to have errors both in age and gender information, a scenario that occurs when two samples are mislabeled as each other.
