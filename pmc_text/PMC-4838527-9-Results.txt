Manual curation and clustering of msDNA sequences
The final set of 625 candidate sequences that were identified by an automatic process was highly redundant. The exact copies were pruned, giving rising to a set of 88 unique sequence types. As shown in Fig. 1A, the true msDNA should possess two hairpins in msr and a long hairpin in the msd region. In order to confirm this complex overall topology of msDNA, we examined the RNA secondary structure plots of the 88 candidates visually. In fact, we removed 40 sequences that did not form the appropriate overall topology. See Fig. 3 for a few representative surviving examples. Among the original 625 sequences, 525 can be mapped to these 48 unique sequence types (Supplementary Table 1).
In order to cluster the remaining 48 sequence types further, allowing small divergences within clusters, multiple-sequence alignment was performed with Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT) [10]. From the resulting dendrogram, we recognized 20 groups by splitting the tree at a branch length of between 0.12 and 0.20 (Fig. 4). The species distribution of the 525 msDNA sequences over the 20 groups is given in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1.
