Process for combining datasets
For combining datasets, gene expression ratios are rearranged in order of expression ratios by each gene in each dataset, and the ranks are matched with the corresponding experimental group. If the experimental groups are homogenous, the ranks within the same experimental group would be neighboring. The process of discretization of gene expressions is summarized in the following steps [3]:
Rank the gene expression ratios within a gene for each dataset.
List in order of the ranks, and assign the order of gene expressions to the corresponding experimental groups.
Summarize the result of (2) in the form of a contingency table for each gene.
Combine the contingency tables that have been summarized for each dataset.
When there are three datasets to be combined, the datasets can be added as a single entry, as shown in Table 2, after the transformation of each dataset by rank.
