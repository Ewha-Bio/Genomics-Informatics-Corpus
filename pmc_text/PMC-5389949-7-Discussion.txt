We have developed TRAPR, an R package for RNA-Seq data analysis. TRAPR provides an entire pipeline for RNA-Seq analysis, which is not merely a combination of currently available tools, but the backbone that facilitates the proper application and coordination of these tools. For instance, upper-quartile normalization followed by zero-value filtering, VSN, and edgeR statistical testing with proper data visualization can easily be streamlined through TRAPR. These combinations will help improve accuracy and statistical power. TRAPR provides visualization tools and file I/O functions to evaluate the quality and characteristics of the data. TRAPR was developed and integrated in R, such that it can be easily applied to other technologies like Serial Analysis of Gene Expression and microarray. Various filters have been integrated into the package. TRAPR can be used as a platform to interweave RNA-Seq data analysis tools and packages to take advantage of the virtues of each.
