Semantic data modeling
Elements and relations were maintained and linked by relation and object. This semantic model enabled elements to be mapped to known elements. Relations between biological data are used to efficiently extract interactions of interest. The semantic modeling in this study was configured in the generic BioXM knowledge management environment to create a knowledge base for this translational systems biology approach. We constructed semantic networks for the discovery of a network biomarker using BioXM software (Biomax Information AG), which is a customizable knowledge base management tool for scientific data. The graphical data model is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Table 1, we created elements such as “Foods,” “Foods Group,” “Food Name,” “Metabolites,” and nine other elements to describe the available biological knowledge. Information on the interconnection of elements is captured in relations such as “is related to” for “Foods” or “regulates” for a metabolite that regulates expression of a gene. This network consisted of 13 elements and 20 relations. The semantic network provided information on connections between included objects instantly. Therefore, this integrated semantic data model was used to create new knowledge networks with flexible workflows.
