We used two sets of organisms, A and B. Set A was basically retrieved from stAIcalc. The server does not provide the stAI of genes, but the pre-calculated relative adaptiveness of a codon (w) is accessible. Out of data on 97 species in the server, 96 species were used, except one species whose CDS information was not accessible in NCBI. In addition to set A, we retrieved sequence information of model organisms provided by Ensembl. Among them, we used 55 species, the tRNA copy numbers of which are available in GtRNAdb. In total, the stAI values of genes in 148 species were calculated. The number of species in Fungi and Viridiplantae was relatively small, and most species were classified into Archaea, Bacteria, and Metazoa (Fig. 1).Three species (S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster) included in both sets were used to compare the stAI values (Fig. 2A–C). The results showed somehow high but not perfect correlations (R = 0.89, 0.86, 0.72 for S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster, respectively). It is because species-specific relative adaptiveness values were obtained differently. Values for set A were obtained from precalculated values in stAIcalc; those for set B were calculated based on coding sequences retrieved from a recent version of Ensembl. Indeed, differences between set A and set B were observed for some codons (Fig. 2D–F). Sabi et al. (2017) [17] stated that the values provided by stAIcalc were calculated based on the NCBI genome. Thus, the differences may be caused by the difference between coding sequences that were stored in the NCBI genome at the time when stAIcalc was constructed. Distributions of stAIs were compared with respect to species (Fig. 3). We could not observe any rules, such as organisms in certain kingdom have higher stAIs or multicellular higher organisms have lower stAIs. Similarly, previous studies have failed to find rules on the evolution of codon usage [22, 23].We compared stAI values with respect to the pathway-based gene classification defined in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) for each species. In most species, including the 3 model organisms in Fig. 4, the genes involved in ‘ribosome’ had the highest stAI values. This seems to be caused by the fact that ribosomal proteins are pivotal house-keeping genes; so, their expressions are highly maintained. Likewise, we expect subsequent studies of pathway-based comparisons of stAI values to help find rules that govern what kinds of biological processes need more tRNA adaptation and how they are to be regulated.
