HLA allele frequency distribution of the two cohorts
Next, we examined the HLA allele frequencies in each cohort. We imputed the HLA information using SNP2HLA. The imputation gave us binary markers for (1) HLA alleles, (2) amino acid residues, and (3) intragenic SNPs. Using imputed binary markers, we extracted two-digit and four-digit HLA alleles for each sample. As a result, we obtained a total of 23,504 imputed alleles for eight genes in 2,938 samples. We focused on the two-digit alleles in this analysis. When we counted the number of unique two-digit alleles in each gene, we found 18 alleles for HLA-A, 27 alleles for HLA-B, 13 alleles for HLA-C, three alleles for HLA-DPA1, 17 alleles for HLA-DPB1, six alleles for HLA-DQA1, five alleles for HLA-DQB1, and 13 alleles for HLA-DRB1. Most of the alleles (97) were observed in both cohorts, and five alleles were detected in a single cohort (two alleles for 58C and three alleles for UKBS). The two-digit HLA allele frequencies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics of the two-digit HLA allele frequency distribution in each cohort. These statistics did not show distinctive differences between the two cohorts. The mean absolute difference in the HLA allele frequencies was 0.00562. Fig. 4A and 4B show the patterns of the HLA allele frequency differences. We then performed the K-S test for each HLA gene, and the results are presented in Fig. 4C. All the HLA genes showed non-significant p-values in the K-S test, demonstrating that there was no significant difference in the imputed HLA allele frequencies between the two control cohorts.
