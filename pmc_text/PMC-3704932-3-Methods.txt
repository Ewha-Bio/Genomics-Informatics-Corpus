SNP selection
Using the NHGRI GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies) [23], 9 articles were identified with the query terms "hair," "eye," "iris," and "facial morphology," and 26 SNPs with association p-values < 5 Ã— 10-8 (GWAS p-value) were selected from the articles [10, 24-31]. The most significant SNPs were selected from the SNPs that were under pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 > 0.8).
