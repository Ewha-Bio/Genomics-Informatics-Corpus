The fate of the patients infected with HBV was determined by several factors, including host immune reactions. Type I IFNs play a key role in the defense against HBV infection and therefore in the prevention of chronic hepatitis. IFI6 is induced by type I IFN. To test the effect of IFI6 polymorphisms on the chronicity of HEP, samples were collected from SR controls (HBsAg-), who recovered from HBV infection without any treatment, and CLD patients, including HEP and CIR groups (HBsAg+), who were at risk of HBV infection. To analyze first whether variations in the IFI6 gene were associated with the susceptibility to HEP in the Korean population, 107 controls in the SR group, 108 patients in the HEP group, and 95 patients in the CIR group were analyzed for six SNPs of IFI6 (n = 302). The characteristics of the study subjects are summarized in Table 1.
In the first phase or discovery stage, four out of six SNPs (rs1316896, rs4908351, rs1141747, and rs2808430) were monomorphic. Genetic variants of rs2808426 and rs10902662 did not show evidence of departure from minor allele frequency and HWE in either of the groups (p > 0.05). Two genotypes had minor allele frequencies greater than 1% (Table 2). The results of the genotype analysis showed that the CC genotype was the most common in the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms in all groups. To analyze the genetic association between IFI6 polymorphisms and clearance from CLD, HEP, and CIR, multiple logistic regression analysis with adjustment for gender and age was performed.
In the comparison between SR and CLD patients, rs2808426 was associated with CLD in a recessive model (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021). In addition, rs10902662 showed significant differences between the SR and CLD groups in a recessive model (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.18 to 14.44; p = 0.027). After the permutation test, the rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs still had significant correlations (p < 0.026). After Bonferroni's correction, only rs2808426 had significant correlations (p = 0.042) (Table 2).
Comparison between the SR and HEP groups showed that the IFI6 SNPs rs2808426 and rs10902662 in the promoter region were associated with a higher risk that correlated with the homozygous variant TT genotype in a recessive model (OR, 6.60; 95% CI, 1.64 to 26.52; p = 0.008). After the permutation test, the rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs still had significant correlations (p = 0.001 in both genotype analyses), which were maintained after Bonferroni's correction (p = 0.016 in both genotype analyses) (Table 2).
The results of the multiple logistic regression analysis comparing the SR and CIR groups showed that the rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs were not associated in all genetic models (Table 2).
The possible genetic linkage between the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms in the protection against chronic HBV infection was examined. LD blocks were constructed by the Gabriel method using Haploview software. The complete LD block consisted of rs2808426 and rs10902662 and showed a pairwise |D'| = 1 and r2 = 0.942, which reflect strong LD. The variants across IFI6 consisted of a single LD block structure composed of two haplotypes (HTs). The diplotype consisted of HT1 C-C (C allele of rs2808426; C allele of rs10902662) and HT2 T-T (T allele of rs2808426; T allele of rs10902662). The results of the HT estimation showed that the CC and TT haplotypes accounted for over 99% distribution in all groups. According to three genetic models, estimated HTs were used for diplotype analysis by logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex.
In the recessive model, HT1 frequency was significantly different between the SR and the CLD (OR, 0.021; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021) and HEP (OR, 6.67; 95% CI, 1.64 to 26.52; p = 0.008) groups. Analysis of the HT2 diplotype showed a significant difference between the SR and HEP (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 1.64 to 26.52; p = 0.008) and CLD (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 1.18 to 14.44; p = 0.027) groups in the dominant model (Table 3). All diplotype p-values remained significant after the permutation test (p < 0.022), and with the exception of HT2 in the SR and CLD groups, almost all of the diplotype p-values remained significant after Bonferroni's correction (p < 0.042).
To replicate the significant associations of the SNP rs2808426, 736 samples, consisting of 205 SR, 437 HEP, and 94 CIR patients, were collected. The clinical information of the patients included in the analysis is summarized in Table 1. The second-stage genotyping was performed using the Taqman assay. The association of rs2808426 with CLD was assessed using the three genetic models, and multiple logistic regression with adjustment for gender and age was used as the first-stage analysis. The results of the genotype analysis of the second set of samples in association with CLD are summarized in Table 4.
The significance of the results of the first genotype analysis was not maintained in the second genotype analysis. Furthermore, no significant associations were detected in a meta-analysis of the first-stage and second-stage samples (Table 4).
