Dataset
We obtained a genome-wide 58,960-SNP dataset (Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 50K Xba chip; Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) from the HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium website (http://www4a.biotec.or.th/PASNP) [12]. The SNP data were obtained from 1,833 individual DNA samples collected from blood and buccal samples of 72 Asian and non-Asian ethnic groups. Filtering SNPs is an important step in genome-wide studies to minimize potential false findings. We filtered SNPs at 2 levels: individual and SNP. In the individual-level filtering step, we removed individual SNPs that had a <90% genotyping call rate and that were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.001). We filtered out 89 of the initial 1,833 individuals and used SNPs from the 1,744 individuals for further study. In the SNP-level filtering step, 1,692 of the initial 58,960 SNPs were filtered out, because 389 SNPs had an SNP call rate below 90%, 451 SNPs were physically unmapped, 103 SNPs could not be mapped to dbSNP, and 749 SNPs were monomorphic. Finally, we obtained 56,025 SNP markers from 1,744 genotyped individuals, representing 72 ethnic groups in the HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium.
For comparison with other ethnic variants, we obtained SNPs of 209 HapMap individuals representing 4 populations (China Han [CHB]; Japan Japanese [JYP]; USA European [CEU]; Africa Yoruba [YRI]) (http://www.hapmap.org/). The 243 SNPs in the HUGO Pan-Asian with the HapMap dataset were nonshared SNP loci and excluded.
