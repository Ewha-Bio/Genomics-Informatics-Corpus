Materials and cell culture
NS-398 and aspirin were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Celecoxib was a generous gift from Dr. S.V. Yim (Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea). HDFs, isolated from foreskin [7], were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 units/mL) in a 5% CO2 incubator [6].
