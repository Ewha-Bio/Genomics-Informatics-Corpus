Clinical characteristics
Table 1 describes the clinical characteristics of OH case and control subjects in the Ansan and Ansung cohorts; 311 participants (7.6%) and 496 participants (14.3%) were found to have OH in Ansan and Ansung, respectively. The gender distributions of OH differed significantly in both cohorts, and more male OH in Ansung and less male OH in Ansan were observed. The age of OH in Ansung (58.8 ± 7.8 years) was older than that in Ansan (51.5 ± 8.3 years), reflecting the higher prevalence of OH in Ansung.
The BMI was significantly smaller in Ansung OH cases than controls, but it was not significant in Ansan. While the mean supine BP was significantly higher in OH than controls, the standing BP was significantly lower in OH than controls.
