Subjects
The cohort data from the KARE were used for the analysis. The KARE project, initiated in 2007, is a large cohort study that recruited two population studies from the rural Anseong and urban Ansan cohorts. We analyzed the data of 8,842 individuals (age, 52.2 ± 8.9 years; BMI, 24.6 ± 3.2 kg/m2). Anthropometric measurements, including weight, height, and waist circumference, were measured in all subjects, and BMI was calculated (kg/m2). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) were examined in all subjects. Fasting plasma glucose and lipid profiles, including serum total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, were measured after an overnight fast. Detailed information on the study protocol has been previously described by Cho et al. [16].
MetS was defined according to the modified Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP-ATPIII) diagnostic criteria, which require the presence of three out of the five following factors: 1) abdominal obesity, defined through waist circumference, using the cut-off values for Asians (≥90 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women), 2) triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL or being on lipid-lowering treatment, 3) low HDL-cholesterol (men < 40 mg/dL, women < 50 mg/dL) or being on lipid-lowering treatment, 4) systolic/diastolic BP ≥ 130/85 mm Hg or being on anti-hypertensive treatment, and 5) fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL or previous diagnosis of T2DM or anti-diabetic treatment [30, 31].
