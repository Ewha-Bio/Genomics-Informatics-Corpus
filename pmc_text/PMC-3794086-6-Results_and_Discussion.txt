Parallel and systematic GWA studies of a number of traits using a single genetic epidemiology dataset give a unique opportunity to explore common biological pathways regulating multiple traits that do not display phenotypic correlations. In this report, we focused on the 49 baseline quantitative trait data that were demographic, anthropometric, or blood chemistry parameters.
We surveyed the literature for the published GWA studies, based on the KARE data, and extracted the information on the analysis conditions, such as exclusion of samples and covariates of association regression. For the GWA analyses of all 49 traits, we included area, age, and sex as covariates, and for some of the traits, additional covariates were added, based on the literature information (Table 1). The phenotypic relations were also learned from principal component analysis (PCA). For example, the directions pointed by waist and body mass index (BMI) were similar in the PCA plot (Fig. 1); using BMI as one of the covariates for the analysis of waist. On the contrary, we used a literature guide for the analysis of BMI [13]. GWA analyses for all 49 traits were performed using linear regression, as implemented in PLINK, and the resulting SNP p-values were fed into GSA-SNP for gene set analysis.
For each of the 49 traits, we identified biological process GO terms that showed p < 0.05 after multiple testing correction (the lists are available upon request). As GO terms are hierarchically arranged, verbatim matches are not desirable for the comparison of a pair of gene sets. Instead, one should take into consideration the number of nodes in the GO tree that separate a pair of terms. For this, we used so-called semantic similarity, as implemented in the R package GOSemSim. For each pair of traits, we calculated the semantic similarity of the gene sets and plotted it against the correlation coefficient between the trait values (Fig. 2). The pairs showing semantic similarity greater than 0.8 corresponded to traits that had high correlations in the trait values. We also noted many pairs having high semantic similarity, despite low phenotypic correlation.
We selected 46 trait pairs that showed a semantic similarity in gene sets greater than an arbitrary cutoff of 0.75 and depicted the interaction network using Cytoscape (Fig. 3). The traits related to blood lipid levels, such as total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs), formed a small network by themselves. As cholesterol and TGs are components of lipoproteins, it is not surprising to observe such a network. Both hip and waist-hip ratio are connected to suprailiac skinfold; they are all related to body fat. The most striking feature is a large network involving 20 traits. In this network, the traits related to blood glucose levels, such as GLU0, GLU60, GLU120, HbA1c, and HOMA, form a subnetwork. In addition, the traits related to either blood pressure or liver damage also formed respective subnetworks, as expected from their high phenotypic correlations.
We also noted some hub nodes having many first neighbors. Interestingly, the pH level was connected to 7 other traits, none of which showed high phenotypic correlations with it. We examined the gene sets that were commonly shared between these traits (Table 2). Among them, 11 were related to neuron development and function. We surveyed the literature for putative involvement of neuronal or nerve systems in the regulation of those 8 traits (Table 3). Although it is presumptive, this may imply that these traits are regulated partly by common pathways that involve the neuronal system.
In conclusion, our work may be a useful approach for discovering pleiotropy.
