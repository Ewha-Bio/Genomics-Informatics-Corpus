The KARE data
The KARE project, established as part of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES) in 2001, has started to undertake a large-scale genome-wide association analysis in Korean population-based cohort. These cohorts consist of 10,038 participants in the urban Ansan (n = 5,020) and rural Ansung (n = 5,018) communities. The objective of the KARE project is to identify genetic factors of several clinical traits and lifestyle-related diseases by GWAS, based on population-based cohorts. In this analysis, we focused on BMI, one of more than 260 lifestyle-related traits.
DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of all participants and were genotyped with Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Rockville, MD, USA). Genotypes were called using Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis distance (BRLMM) algorithm [20]. We performed a quality control process for the sample and genotype as previously described in Cho et al. [2]. In order to increase the coverage of common variants and capture additional association signals, we performed SNP imputation with PLINK using the Japanese/Chinese (JPT/CHB) component of HapMap as the reference. After sample and genotype quality controls, 327,872 SNPs for 8,842 individuals were available in the KARE data. We applied our proposed regularization method to Korean genome-wide data.
