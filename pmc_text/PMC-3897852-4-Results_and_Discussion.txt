Mutation frequency in patients' tumor samples
From the TCGA database, thousands of patients' tumor samples were analyzed to detect variants in the whole genome. To quantify the genome-wide mutation profile in diverse tumors, we organized the whole mutant genes into several cancer types and stages, using the annotation information obtained from TCGA. Overall, a total of 871,684 mutations were virtually found in 23,050 human genes from 2,938 patient tumor samples (Table 1). Samples covered 11 diverse cancer types (Table 1). These data were continuously updated and produced by analyzing additional samples. Together with the extended production of multi-level omics data using the same patients' tissue samples, TCGA provides a useful resource for understanding the role of mutations in cancer progression.
The distribution of mutant genes on each sample showed that a variety of genes are mutated in individual tumor samples. Most samples contained on average 20-80 mutations (Fig. 1A). This means that each single tumor sample has mutations in multiple genes. Various mutations in a cancer sample were already well-characterized and constructed as open source data [8], and the significance of multiple mutations in a single tumor has been constantly suggested [9, 10]. It is appropriate that a tumor may also consist of a heterogeneous collection of cells with different types of mutations. Furthermore, in the aspect of lineage dependency, the amount of mutations in individual samples varied, depending on cancer type (Fig. 1C). Lung adenocarcinoma samples have a wide range of mutation frequencies in individual samples and harbor more mutations than other lineages. The broad range of mutation frequencies in lung cancer was also referred to in Lawrence et al. [11]. In contrast, thyroid carcinoma has relatively few mutations in individual samples. Further studies are required to understand the association with the amounts of mutations and major biological factors in each cancer type. This can be analyzed by comparing with the patient's clinical information, including smoking.
On the other hand, the mutation of each gene was observed at a very low frequency in all samples (Fig. 1B). Most genes contained mutations in less than 1% of samples, and only a few genes contained mutations in over 5% of all samples. Generally, the mutation of a gene showed low frequency in all cancer types, except in uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC) (Fig. 1D). Mutant genes were found in 2.4% of UCEC samples (>2-fold greater than other lineages), and sometimes, a gene showed a mutation in >8% of UCEC tumors. In conclusion, there are only a few genes in which mutations are frequently (i.e., >1-2%) found in tumor. Genes with relatively frequent mutations in tumors may have a significant role in cancer progression.
