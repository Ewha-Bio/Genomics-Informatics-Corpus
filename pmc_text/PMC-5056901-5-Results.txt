Candidate SNP selection
Of the 43 SLE-associated loci identified by Bentham et al. [12], we narrowed down the candidate SNPs for this study per the following criteria: SNPs that had not been replicated in the Korean population, SNPs with a minor allele frequency above 5% in an East Asian population, and SNPs that were replicated in the Korean population but inconclusive owing to the limited sample size. Seven of the 43 SNPs were not replicated in the Korean population, and five of them showed a minor allele frequency above 5% in the East Asian population (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, we selected the five SNPs for a replication study in Koreans (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus, rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) (Table 1). Three of them were nonsynonymous, and the other two were intronic SNPs.
