In addition to the aforementioned genomic features, some high-order genome organizations might contribute to genome instability. New observations in the human genome showed that the DNA mutation rate is associated with DNA replication timing. Stamatoyannopoulos et al. [69] found that the human point mutation rate is markedly increased in genomic regions of late replication. This correlation indicates that DNA replication timing, as an important feature of replication dynamics, is involved in genomic instability and enlightens the investigation on the relationship of replication timing and CNV instability.
