miRNA is a well-known form of noncoding RNA that affects biological mechanisms by regulating the expression of target mRNA. Many researchers have found that cancer cells and normal cells exhibit different inhibition mechanisms, suggesting that miRNAs could be used as biological markers for the diagnosis of cancer [1-3]. In our previous study, we presented a hierarchical structural component model (HisCoM-mimi) to find the miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs associated with binary phenotypes that could be candidates for cancer diagnosis biomarkers with an interpretable biological inhibition mechanism. Recently, many findings regarding the target mRNAs of miRNAs have been incorporated into various databases. TargetScan is one such database with recently updated findings [4]. The basic principle used by TargetScan to predict the mRNAs that miRNAs target for inhibition is to compare the sequences of untranslated mRNA regions to those of miRNAs [5]. However, many studies have shown that miRNAs select their target mRNAs based not only on the similarity of sequences, but also on other structural findings [6]. Thus, miRNA-mRNA integration analysis requires experimental confirmation of which mRNAs are truly inactivated by miRNAs. MiRTarBase is a database that collects experimental findings [6]. In our previous study, we only used TargetScan to find pairs of miRNA-mRNA relationships [7]. To enable researchers to utilize more flexibly information regarding the target mRNAs inhibited by miRNAs, we added miRTarBase database information to our software.
