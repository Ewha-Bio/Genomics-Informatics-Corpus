Validation using gene synteny relation between A. thaliana and B. rapa
For validation with gene synteny, the protein sequence of B. rapa were matched to those of A. thaliana using BLASTP (Blast 2.2.26), and the top four hits for each query were retained. The tabulated results were then sorted, based on the genomic coordinates of each protein, and the gene synteny relation was examined manually.
