GWASs have so many false positives. p < 10-2 (1% significance level) means a 1 in 100 coincidence. If you try 1,000 times, you can hit 10 targets and 100,000 times, 1,000 targets-all quite by chance. Therefore, association needs replication, but repeating in the same population is not a good idea; it might just introduce the same error in the first study, which is sometimes difficult to detect. Studies in different populations, preferably in populations from different ethnic groups, are desirable. Because one population is one experiment of nature, one ethnic group is one experiment given from heaven. Every experiment is precious. Multiple replications in large samples provide the most straightforward path for identifying robust and broadly relevant associations. International collaboration is necessary. For international replication, East Asia has a definite advantage when we consider its relative genetic similarity among the subpopulations, large population size, and high medical standard of the countries in the area.
