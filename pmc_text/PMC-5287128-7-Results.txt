Data analysis of kimchi from the knowledge base
We found a total 4,351 genes strongly associated with kimchi's secondary metabolites using the KFSR, as shown in Fig. 3. First, 1,237 kimchi metabolites were extracted form >7,500 foods in KFSR and 4,351 genes were associated with 1,237 kimchi metabolites. Through the semantically integrated datasets, we discovered genes that were associated with kimchi metabolites. This network is shown in Fig. 4. We used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway to classify genes by metabolic function. The genes in Table 3 are classified into six categories, and 309 of these genes were found to be involved in lipid metabolism. At first, we initiated a cardiovascular disease network analysis related to kimchi using 30 genes. Of these, 27 were directly connected by interactions such as regulation, promoter binding, direct regulation, protein modification, and miRNA regulation. Genes like ADCY5, ADCY1, ADCY2, GNAS, CTNNB1, EDN1, and RAC1 were the most highly connected nodes with node degrees of ≥10 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5A). Adenyl cyclases (ADCYs) are critical regulators of metabolic and cardiovascular function, and ADCY5 is increased in hearts with pressure-overloaded left ventricular hypertrophy [1415]. In addition, guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs (GNAS) overexpression results in increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimulation and cardiomyopathy [16], as shown in Fig. 4A. In addition, GNAS leads to the activation of β-catenin which is a multifunctional protein coded by the CNNB1 gene. Although there has long been speculation on the association between kimchi and heart disease, Lee et al. [16] demonstrated that kimchi may not adversely affect blood pressure and cardiac function.
Kimchi is effective in enhancing immune function [31819]; however, the scientific evidence to support this claim has been insufficient. In this work, we performed an immune disease network analysis related to kimchi, based on public information and using 39 selected genes. Twenty-three genes were directly connected to each other by interactions such as regulation, promoter binding, direct regulation, protein modification, and miRNA regulation. In particular, PTPRC, LCK, JAK3, ZAP70, and VEGFA were the most highly connected nodes with node degrees of ≥7 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5B). Specifically, PTPRC and JAK3 were found to regulate innate immune responses [202122]. This analytic information database, the KFSR, may suggest ways to analyze and more effectively use existing scientific data.
