Genetic mutations have been known as one of the key factors in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Besides the well-known single-nucleotide variants, it has been shown that the large-scale genomic variants also make a great contribution to human health. 'Genomic disorders' are human diseases caused by relatively large genomic rearrangements [1]. Such large-scale genomic variants (named copy number variation [CNV]) can also be frequent in human populations [2, 3]. CNV involves DNA segments larger than 1 kb and exhibits variable copy numbers among individuals, comprising deletions and duplications/insertions [4, 5]. In the past 10 years, CNV has been found to play an important role in both sporadic Mendelian disorders and complex diseases. Previous studies have reported that CNV can be mediated by multiple molecular mechanisms involving various genomic features. Here, we focus on CNV mutagenesis and review the involvement of human genome architecture in CNV instability and the underlying molecular mechanisms.
