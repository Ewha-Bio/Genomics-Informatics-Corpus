Hybridization to expression arrays
The following procedures were carried out by Macrogen Co. (Seoul, Korea). First, total RNA was amplified and purified using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit to yield biotinylated cRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Briefly, 550 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, in vitro-transcribed, and labeled with biotin-NTP. After purification, 750 ng of labeled cRNA was hybridized to the humanHT-12 expression v.4 bead array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for 16-18 h at 58â„ƒ. The array signal was detected using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Arrays were scanned with an Illumina bead array reader/confocal scanner. Array data were filtered by a detection p-value < 0.05 (similar to signal to noise). Selected gene signal values were log-transformed and normalized by the quantile method.
