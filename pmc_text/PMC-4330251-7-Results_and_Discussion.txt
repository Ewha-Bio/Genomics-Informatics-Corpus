Wnt signaling pathway-related genes in colorectal cancer
Both the SFRP1 and SFRP2 genes are known to show DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancers; their relatively low expression causes upregulation of Wnt signaling and thus tumor cell proliferation [11]. Wnt2, a member of the Wnt gene family, and SFRP1 showed drastically opposite gene expression patterns in the discovery dataset (Fig. 4). Given the premise that downregulation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 due to DNA hypermethylation deteriorates the inhibition of the Wnt ligand signaling pathway, we surveyed the gene expression profile of the pathway genes, including SFRP. The significance of the differential expression of each gene was measured by t test using the discovery dataset. The p-value distributions were compared between the genes involved in Wnt signaling (n = 151) and those that were not involved in Wnt signaling (n = 17,658) using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The genes involved in Wnt signaling showed more significant differential expression than the others (p = 0.01658). SFRP1 and WNT2 were among the top ranked genes of the pathway (Fig. 5).
