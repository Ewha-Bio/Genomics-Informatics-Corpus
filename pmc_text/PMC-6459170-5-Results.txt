ERBB signaling pathway activation cells in TNBC
To validate HER2+ pathway activated TNBC for the breast cancer subtype, marker gene expression was evaluated with bulk RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq data. Three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) were selected [5]. In the bulk RNA-seq data, BC07 showed low expression for ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR (Fig. 2A). In the scRNA data, ERBB2 expression in HER2+ likely cells from BC07 was lower than in other HER2+ subtype patients (2.2e16) and not higher than the other TNBC patients (p> 0.01) (Fig. 2B). The subtyping marker gene expression pattern in the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA data looked like that of the TNBC subtype. However, ERBB pathway regulators (PIK3CB and RAF1) were highly expressed in HER2+ likely cells. PIK3CB and RAF1 have been reported to be ERBB signaling pathway regulators and activators in cancer [6, 7]. The expression of PIK3CN and RAF1 was increased in HER2+ likely cells and activated (p<0.01). This result shows that the ERBB signaling pathway was activated in the TNBC subtype but that the mechanism was different from the HER+ subtype.
