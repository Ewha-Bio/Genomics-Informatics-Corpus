(A) 3D structure of predicted human papillomavirus (HPV) 18 E6 model. (B) Ramachandran plot of predicted E6 model (The red, dark yellow, and light yellow regions represent the most favored, allowed, and generously allowed regions). (C) ProSA-web Z-scores of all protein chains in Protein Data Bank (PDB) determined by X-ray crystallography (light blue) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with respect to their length. The Z-score of E6 was present in that range represented in black dot. (D) Energy plot for the predicted E6 of HPV18. (E) ERRAT plot for residue-wise analysis of homology model.
