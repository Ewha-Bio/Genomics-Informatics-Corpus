Processing for the genotype and RNA-seq datasets
We downloaded a genotype dataset in 1001 Genomes Data Center [10] and an RNA-seq dataset in the GEO database (GSE43858) [11] in order to identify genome-wide sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana. In order to increase the accuracy of the mapping of RNA-seq reads, we manually filtered out low-quality reads and aligned them to the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome. The aligned reads were estimated by Cufflinks [14]. As a result, we obtained and analyzed the quantifications of 41,621 isoforms and 5,833,535 SNP markers of the 141 matched strains.
