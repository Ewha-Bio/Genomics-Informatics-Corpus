The transcriptional signature of RAW 264.7 cells after stimulation with 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO), interferon-β (IFN-β), and 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br). (A) The bars in the diagram represent the numbers of differentially expressed genes at 60 min and 120 min of stimulation, as assessed with Limma. (B) Hierarchical clustering of responses to 60 min and 120 min of stimulation was conducted using K-means clustering and visualized by MeV software. The cluster shown represents those macrophage genes that were significantly regulated by KDO, IFN-β, or 8-Br treatment. Red squares represent genes that were upregulated, black squares indicate no change, and green squares indicate downregulated genes.
