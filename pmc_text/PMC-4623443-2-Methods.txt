Plasma and tissue samples
The plasma and tissue samples (including matched non-tumor tissues) from patients with gastric cancer were retrieved from the Chungnam National University Hospital, Republic of Korea. All patients gave their written consent prior to sample collection. The acquisition of clinical material was approved by the local institution review board. These plasma samples were drawn from 35 patients (18 men, 17 women) with gastric neoplasm and 35 control individuals (18 men, 17 women) without neoplastic disease. There was no significant difference in age between the neoplastic group (51.80 ± 11.88 years) and the control group (48.94 ± 11.86 years) (Supplementary Table 1). The demographic characteristics of the subjects who provided the 73 paired tissue samples are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.
