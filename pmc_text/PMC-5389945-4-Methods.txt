Selection of donor-specific SNP markers
In order to differentiate donor DNA from recipient DNA, SNP markers were selected from a panel of SNPs used for sex determination or identification of individuals [13]. A total of seven highly polymorphic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) SNPs were also selected from mtDB (http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se/) and in-house Korean mtDNA variant data, and were used to detect donor-specific mtDNA in patient samples. We designed several TaqMan probe sets to detect each of two alleles in our dPCR screen using the fluorescent dyes FAM and VIC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
