Sequence alignment and variant calling
The raw reads in the prepared datasets were aligned to the hg19 reference genome, which was downloaded from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/), using BWA (bwa-0.6.2) [16] with default parameters and a seed length of 45 bp. The Sequence Alignment and Mapping (SAM) files were converted to Binary Alignment and Mapping (BAM) files using SAMtools [17]. Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) was used to mark and remove the polymerase chain reaction duplicates detected from the BAM files. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [18] was then used for base quality recalibration and local realignment around the potential indel sites. The UnifiedGenotyper [19] in the GATK was used in the final step for variant calling using a Bayesian model. Variants were filtered by three types of filtering methods: (1) HARD_TO_VALIDATE: MQ0 ≥4 and [(MQ0/(1.0 × DP)] >0.1; (2) QualFilter: QUAL <10; and (3) Additional: QUAL <30.0 || MQ <20.0 || DP <7.
