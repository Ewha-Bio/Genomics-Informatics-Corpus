(A) Predicted protein structure of neuraminidase (NA). (B) Ramachandran plot of predicted NA model (the red, dark yellow, and light yellow regions represent the most favored, allowed, and generously allowed regions). (C) ProSA-web Z-scores of NA (all protein chains in Protein Data Bank [PDB] determined by X-ray crystallography [light blue] and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [dark blue] with respect to their length). (D) ERRAT plot of NA for residue-wise analysis of homology model. NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance. aOn the error axis, two lines are drawn to indicate the confidence with which it is possible to reject regions that exceed that error value.
