Correlations among different codon bias indices
In this study, we compared the performances of several commonly used measures underlying gene expression. The outlines of gene expression of the crenarchaeal genomes were governed by calculating CAI, RCA, RCBS, and MRCBS. Currently, CAI has become widely accepted method for theoretically recognizing highly expressed genes from codon usage in various organisms. The CAI scores were calculated by taking all RP (>80aa) genes as PHE genes which are commonly referred as reference set. RCA frequencies were computed using the identical reference set as used in the calculation of CAI. The results (Fig. 1) indicate that there is a strong correlation between RCA and CAI while the correlation of RCBS with CAI is significantly smaller. The novel method of quantitatively calculating gene expressivity by MRCBS was then compared with CAI and correlation between them was found to be surprisingly good. These correlation coefficients can be used to express the strength of the existing prediction methods. It can be seen that MRCBS consistently yields better correlation than other. We also observed a clear correlation between CAI and GC3, but surprisingly, there was strong negative correlation between GC3 and CAI in some species which cannot be explained.
In order to validate our results with the experimental data [38], we collected proteomics and microarray data and compared the proteomic and microarray results with our predicted values of expression level. Fig. 2 plotted the relative abundances of mRNA and protein levels of the genes of S. solfataricus grown on yeast extract and tryptone (YT) compared to glucose (G) against CAI, RCBS, RCA, and MRCBS. The correlation coefficient between transcriptomics and MRCBS was found to be −0.31 whereas that with CAI, RCA, and RCBS were 0.04, −0.17, and −0.26, respectively and correlation coefficient between proteomics and MRCBS was −0.44 whereas that with CAI, RCA, and RCBS were −0.18, −0.34, and 0.05, respectively. Even though these results are not good, but the results recommend that a quantitative estimate of expression level by MRCBS accomplishes better performance than other existing computational methods.
We demonstrated that MRCBS could be a useful tool for predicting highly expressed genes. The basic concept validating our method was to compare the result of different gene expression measures with a universal measure, the CAI values of the genes. This methodology is accepted as CAI is widely assumed to be universal method and highly correlated with different measures of codon bias used in the literature [13]. Predicting gene expression levels in different crenarchaeal genomes using MRCBS is to make this index a better choice of measuring codon bias than others. CAI hypothesized that background nucleotide composition was uniform and this hypothesis was not always true. RCA uses codon bias of highly expressed genes of a given reference set like other reference set based measures (e.g., CAI) but the difference between RCA and CAI is that RCA uses the patterns of mutational bias observed in the given reference set. For any given reference set, MRCBS first computes the codon bias as the deviation of the observed codon frequency from the expected codon frequency based on its positional base frequencies and ratio between the RCB of that codon and the largest RCB among its synonymous codons is defined as the relative adaptiveness of that codon. Thus, MRCBS takes explicitly into account the mutational bias in the calculation of codon bias and will be more powerful and precise estimator of gene expression.
To measure the predictive performance of MRCBS, we compared the performances of several commonly used measures in different crenarchaeal genomes. Our results demonstrated that MRCBS well correlated with CAI than other codon bias measures in all crenarchaeal genomes. Since experimental methods are expensive and laborious, results of gene expression by computational methods might be used as reference data for validating and better understanding experimental data. For example, findings of PHE gene with low level expression from proteomic or microarray data could suggest the probable contribution of degradation in regulating expression levels of that gene [8]. Although most of the PHE genes are essential genes responsible for the habitat, energy sources and life style of different species of Crenarchaeota, the results are also predicted a number of genes in DUF as PHE genes. Combined study of computational and experimental approach of these genes will enrich our knowledge of metabolism.
