Pharmacometabolomic analyses
Metabolomic profiling to identify metabolites of drug X was performed in plasma samples using liquid chromatography (Agilent 1200 series, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent 6530 Q-TOF MS, Agilent Technologies). To prepare the analyte, a 100 μL of plasma sample was mixed with 400 μL of acetonitrile. Five microliters of supernatant aliquot was injected onto the Agilent Zorbax C18 column (1.8 μm particle size, 2.1 × 50 mm; Agilent Technologies) at 30°C under gradient elution for 18 min. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of 0.1% formic acid in 2 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Positive ion electrospray ionization mode was used for mass spectrometry. The phase I and phase II metabolites of drug X were identified by molecular feature extraction of Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Software version B.03.01 (Agilent Technologies).
