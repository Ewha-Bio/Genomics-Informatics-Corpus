Statistical analysis
The association analyses were done using PLINK version 1.07 [24] for both genotyped and imputed SNPs. A test for BMD was done by linear regression with an additive model (1 degree of freedom [d.f.]) after adjustments for age, sex, and recruitment area. Statistical significance was determined by p < 0.05 in a two-tailed test. p-values were not adjusted for multiple testing of SNPs. Proximal SNPs and pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) were computed by PLINK. A threshold for correlation was set as r2 > 0.8. Annotation of SNPs was done by SNPnexus [26]. The effect of SNPs on protein function was predicted using SIFT [27] and PolyPhen [28]. Transcription factor binding sites were inferred from the TRANSFAC database [29].
