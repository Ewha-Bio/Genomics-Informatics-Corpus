Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type of leukemia among hematologic malignancies. This disease is a clonal hematopoietic disease that is caused by either inherited or acquired genetic mutations. AML is known to be a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease [1]. In order to cure this disease, cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C)-based chemotherapy is widely used. Two thirds of AML patients who receive Ara-C based chemotherapy regimen, will achieve complete remission (CR). However, more than 50% of patients suffer a relapse after attaining CR [2]. Eventually, a great majority of AML patients die from progressive disease after relapse by various genetic changes that will endow tumor cells with resistance against most commonly used anticancer agents. Therefore, it is prerequisite to identify prognostic markers that will help in deciding the suitable treatment modalities. A lot of studies have focused on finding somatic mutations in cancer cells by whole-exome sequencing (WES). However, these studies did not fully explain the mechanisms of how disease relapses.
In the initial development of cancer in humans, Knudson's two-hit hypothesis has provided important insights into the pathogenesis of tumors in autosomal dominant tumor predisposition syndromes [3]. With an analogy, we focused on the additional genetic changes that will predispose susceptible individuals with a pre-existing genetic abnormality to develop leukemia. To address this issue, germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed using the UCSC hg19 program in 10 AML patients (samples, G1 to G10), and somatic mutations were identified in the same tumor sample using SomaticSniper and VarScan2. Our results suggest that SNPs with additional somatic mutations may directly affect the prognosis of AML and emphasize the need to validate in a larger patient cohort.
