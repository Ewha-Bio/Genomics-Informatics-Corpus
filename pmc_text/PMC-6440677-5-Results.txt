To examine the accuracy of the three public databases, we compared known taxonomies from the mock community with the outcome of taxonomic assignments. Assuming an ideal situation, except for sequencing errors or missing a specific strain, we evaluated each database. At the genus and species level, EzBioCloud was the most successful database (Fig. 1A and 1B). Among 44 genera distributed over a total of 60 strains present in the mock community, the EzBioCloud database found over 40 true positive in all six samples. Also, the number of false-positives and false-negatives was lower than that of other databases. In contrast, the Greengenes database found only 30 genera out of a total of 44 genera, and the ratio of false-positives was high. The Silva database found a sufficient number of genera, and the number of false-positives was the highest, with around 20% of the predicted genera being incorrect. Similar results were observed at the species level, but the overall accuracy decreased, and the differences in accuracy between the databases were more clearly revealed. At the species level, EzBioCloud correctly identified about 40 species, but false-positives increased when comparing the result with that of the genus level. Silva correctly identified about 35 genera at the genus level, but about more than 10 of them did not detect the correct answer at the species level. In the case of Greengenes, only a few correct species were found. Among clustering methods, closed reference was the least accurate, regardless of database. We computed several alpha diversity indices to measure the effect associated with three databases. The alpha diversity indices Observed and Chao1 showed sample diversity from the perspective of richness and evenness (Fig. 1C). When using the same clustering method, we observed that the richness of EzBioCloud was the lowest in all cases, and its Simpsonâ€™s evenness index was the highest. Only for the Shannon index was the value of Silva higher than that of EzBioCloud.
