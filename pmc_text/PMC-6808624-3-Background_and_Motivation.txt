Consider the scenario where a researcher wants to investigate recent advances in gene interaction research documented in publications from a “document repository” such as PubMed Central. The researcher will select a set of appropriate texts from the repository and apply a named entity recognition (NER) “text analysis service” to identify potential gene mentions in the data. However, even specialized NER tools [9] for the biomedical domain perform at rates of about 0.56 F1-score, at best. So at this point, human intervention is required to correct mis-identified occurrences of gene names as well as annotate unrecognized gene names. A sophisticated “annotation editor” that learns from the user’s activity and can thereby propose new annotations or modifications can significantly increase the speed of the correction process. The revised annotations can then be used to train a machine learning algorithm and applied to other, unannotated texts; results are evaluated, and the training texts are corrected anew, where necessary, by the human user. This overall cycle involving the human-in-the-loop is repeated as many times as necessary until a satisfactory result is obtained. We consider here three platforms, each of which supports some aspect(s) of the process described above, but none of which provides the entire suite of required tools and resources:
