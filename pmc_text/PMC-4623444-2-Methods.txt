Study samples
We downloaded and re-analyzed a previous published mRNA expression microarray data set measured on Affymetrix Human Genome U95A Array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE22309) [5]. This data was measured in human skeletal muscle cell of human individuals: 20 insulin sensitive, 20 insulin resistant, and 15 diabetic patients for before and after insulin treatment. We used only the insulin sensitive group. Total of 12,626 probes were monitored, and we considered genes which are protein-coding gene.
