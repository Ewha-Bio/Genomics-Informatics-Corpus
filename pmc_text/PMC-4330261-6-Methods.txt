Luciferase reporter assays
Twenty-four hours after the start of transfection, Cos7 cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer and harvested, and the transcriptional activity was measured using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and Lumet LB9507 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To normalize transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase activity was measured. Ten microliters of cell lysate was mixed with 3 µL of 100 × MgCl2 (0.1 M MgCl2 and 4.5 M β-mercaptoethanol) and 66 µL 1 × o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside. The activity of β-galactosidase was measured by VersaMax spectrophotometry at 420 nm (Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
