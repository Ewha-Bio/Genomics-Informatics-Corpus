Artificial selection is an aspect of the process of domestication development [1] that is reflected in the evolution of domestic animals. Positive selection increases the fitness of adaptive traits [2]. Previous research has demonstrated that the selection and mating of domestic animals is determined by human-generated pressures, and the genetic differences resulting from artificial selection have led to economic development [3]. Among domestic animals, the pig has experienced a particularly long history of haplotype changes through artificial selection in the process of domestication [24]. For most of their history, studies have found positive selection in Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc to be associated with specific genes related to lactation [56], reproduction [7], meat quality [8], and growth [3] trait. Given the importance of these traits to the pig farming industry, it is necessary to detect the signals of positive selection in pigs.
Identifying genomic selection using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays or sequencing data is useful for the discovery of putative trait-related genes. A variant under selection pressure between and/or within populations will show an increase of the frequency of particular alleles or linkage disequilibrium (LD) of SNPs. Selective sweep can cause genetic differentiation across populations [9]. The cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (XPEHH) [10] and cross-population composite likelihood ratio (XPCLR) [9] tests are widely used to search for signals of selection between the populations. The XPEHH test detects the occurrence of selection based on measuring LD, while the XPCLR test considers the spatial patterns of allele frequencies of SNPs [9]. The XPCLR test is a likelihood method that uses differentiation of multi-locus allele frequencies between two populations to detect selective sweep. Selection with significant signals can break up the haplotype structures more rapidly than mutation or recombination processes [11].
In this study, the XPEHH and XPCLR between-population methods were implemented to detect positive selection in three pig breeds through resequencing using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). To further explain the biological implications of positively selected genes, functional enrichment analysis was performed.
