Polymerase chain reaction
Through a PCR assay, we amplified seven housekeeping genes from the bacteria: 16S rRNA (16S ribosomal RNA) gene, atpA (ATP synthase alpha subunit), dnaK (molecular chaperone protein), glyA (serine hydroxy-methyltransferase), gyrB (DNA gyrase, subunit B), murG (N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase), and tuf (elongation factor Tu). For the PCR amplification of the genes, we used primers designed in a previous study [15]. However, we failed to amplify the dnaK and atpA genes through PCR with the previously designed primers. Thus, we manually designed new PCR primers to amplify these two genes. The primers are listed in Table 1. PCR amplification of each gene was performed in a 25-µL reaction volume using 10 µL of a DNA polymerase kit (TaKaRa EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix; TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan), 200 nM of each oligonucleotide primer, and 50 ng of template DNA. The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 95℃ for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 95℃, 30 s of annealing at 55℃, and 2 min of extension at 72℃; and followed by 5 min of a final extension at 72℃. Two microliters of the resulting PCR products was loaded on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized using UV fluorescence. The remaining PCR products were purified with the Wizard SV gel and PCR clean-up kit (Promega, Madison, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction and sequenced on an ABI 3130XL automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
