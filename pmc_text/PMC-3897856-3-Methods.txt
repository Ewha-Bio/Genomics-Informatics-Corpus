Bacterial growth and genomic DNA isolation
This seven strains were cultured on R2A medium (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) for 5 days at 25â„ƒ and produced creamyellow, semi-transparent colonies. We extracted genomic DNA from the seven Flavobacterium strains using the Wizard genomic DNA purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction.
