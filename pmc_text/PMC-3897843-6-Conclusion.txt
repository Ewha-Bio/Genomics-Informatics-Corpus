Now is the right time to think about how we can use cancer genomics for individual patients. There are still lots of technological hurdles-e.g., functional annotation of sequencing results, the way to integrate multi-dimensional data, and the exploration of the clinical meaning of sequencing variants for the routine clinical usage of cancer genomics. Defining unmet clinical needs is as important as overcoming technological hurdles to maximize the benefit from cancer genomics. Early detection, non-invasive molecular diagnosis, risk prediction of relapse and tumor-related events, monitoring of disease status, matching good drugs, and finding out personal grade resistance mechanisms are good examples of unmet clinical needs that should be solved with cancer genomics. It would speed up and optimize the application of genomics to cancer clinics if cancer biologists, bioinformaticians, and cancer clinicians cooperate towards one goal of achieving it.
