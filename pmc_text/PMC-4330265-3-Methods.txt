Analysis of physico-chemical properties
ProtParam (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/), a tool of Expasy was used for the analysis of the physiological and chemical properties from the protein sequence. This tool can predict different physico-chemical properties, like the molecular weight, isoelectric pH, aliphatic index, grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), and extinction coefficients.
