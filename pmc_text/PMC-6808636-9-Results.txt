Principal component analysis
We first used PCA to analyze differences between the two control cohorts at the population level. We calculated PCs in four ways: (1) using the 58C cohort only, (2) using the UKBS cohort only, (3) using the two cohorts combined, and (4) using the combined set with the HapMap data (N=270) integrated. We applied SNP QC filters before PCA (see Methods). PCs were calculated based on the variance-standardized relationship matrix among the individuals included in each analysis. Fig. 1A and 1B show the PCs in the 58C and UKBS cohorts, respectively, and Fig. 1C shows the results when the two cohorts were merged. Fig. 1C demonstrates high similarity in the ranges of the first two PCs between the two cohorts, except for two outliers (one in each cohort) at the bottom right corner of the plot. Fig. 1D is a tridimensional plot of the PCs of the two control cohorts. The red sphere corresponds to the 58C group, and the blue indicates the UKBS group. In the 3-PC plot, similar to the 2-PC plot, the two cohorts were not visually distinct from each other. Fig. 1E presents the PCs of the WTCCC merged with three HapMap populations (CEU, YRI, and Asian [CHB, JPT]). The plot shows that the 58C, UKBS, and CEU cohorts were grouped together in the PC plot, showing that the two control cohorts had European ancestry homogeneous to the CEU.
