Identification of microbial populations and diversity
The microbial populations, identified on the basis of sequences for both the Prebiocide and Tank A drinking water samples, are listed in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1. Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Mesorhizobium loti, and Bradyrhizobium species were present in the Prebiocide library. Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium belong to rhizobia, a large community of nitrogen fixers often found in association with plant roots [27]. Ralstonia metallidurans and R. eutropha were detected in Tank A. Strains of R. metallidurans (renamed as Cupriavidus metallidurans strain CH34) are prevalent in soils with high heavy metal content [28]. Sequences encoding specific genes from Burkholderia fungorum, a species abundant in soil and groundwater, were found in both the Prebiocide and Tank A samples [23, 29]. Protein sequences homologous to those of several genera of opportunistic pathogens were retrieved by RCA. The genomic DNA amplification by PCR detected different microbial groups in drinking water samples (Table 1, Fig. 3).
