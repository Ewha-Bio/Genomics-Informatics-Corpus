Transient transfection
COS-7 cells were subcultured in 12-well plates the day before transfection; 0.2 µg of pGL3-GLUT2 promoter, 0.02 µg of HNF1B expression plasmids, and 0.05 µg of pCMV-β-galactosidase were combined with LipofectAMINE PLUS agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells, in 400 µL of serum-free DMEM, were treated with the complex for 3 h, and the medium was changed to DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. MIN6 cells were subcultured in 6-well plates the day before transfection. As it is difficult to transfect genes into MIN6 cells, the transfection efficiency was evaluated with the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) first. After the efficiency was confirmed, 0.5 µg of expression vector for HNF1B per well was administered. Serum-containing medium was added up to the normal volume after 3 h of incubation and replaced with fresh complete RPMI 1640 after 8 h. MIN6 cells were harvested for RNA extraction and protein quantitation after 30 h after the start of transfection.
