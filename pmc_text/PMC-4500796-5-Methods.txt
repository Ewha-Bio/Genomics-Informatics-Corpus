Analysis of depth of coverage in the diagnostic gene set
We extracted information for the positions of the 175 diagnostic genes from the hg19 reference genome, which was downloaded from the UCSC genome [24]. Based on this, we analyzed the depth of coverage and mapped mean depth according to increasing sequencing depths using Samtools "mpileup" with default parameters [17].
