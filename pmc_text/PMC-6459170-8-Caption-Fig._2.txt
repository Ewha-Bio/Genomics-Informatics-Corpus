Breast cancer marker gene expression in bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq. (A) Breast cancer marker gene expression pattern in bulk RNA-seq (red, ERBB2; green, ESR1; and blue, PGR). (B) ERBB pathway activation marker gene expression pattern in selected cells (red, CBLB; green, ERBB2; blue, PIK3CB; and purple, RAF1). ER, estrogen receptor; HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer.
