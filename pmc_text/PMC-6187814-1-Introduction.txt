Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are commercial breeds used for pork production. The Landrace pig is a long, white pig with 16 or 17 ribs. Landrace pigs are utilized as Grandparents in the production of F1 parent stock females in a terminal crossbreeding (http://nationalswine.com/about/about_breeds/landrace.php). They outperform other pigs in litter size, birth and weaning weight, rebreeding interval, longevity and durability. Yorkshire pigs are muscular with a high proportion of lean meat. Yorkshire pigs have been maintained with great diligence, with a focus on sow productivity, growth, and backfat formation.
In Korea, the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds in Korea are used for commercial pork production. Pork quality traits are polygenic and quantitative trait loci (QTL) are associated with pork quality traits. In this regard, we analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for backfat thickness (BF) for these breeds. BF is an important trait in pork production. Despite the importance of BF, there have not been in-depth GWAS of the BF in the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds.
Rohrer et al. [1] performed a genome scan for loci affecting pork quality including BF in a Duroc-Landrace F2 population. Okumura et al. [2] studied genomic regions affecting BF by GWAS in a Duroc pig population. Likewise, we performed a GWAS and surveyed gene ontology (GO) terms. The top 5% genes were selected for GO analysis after the GWAS. The GO terms of the top 5% genes belonged to major GO terms of neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization [3â€“5]. Lee et al. [4] used a GWAS for fat thickness in humans and pigs and found that neuronal genes were associated with fat thickness. The results of our study were similar but the genes significantly associated with BF were novel.
