The graphic user interface is implemented in the software for users to easily handle large-scale data or access the analysis result (Fig. 2B and 2C). The recurrent or phenotype-specific mutations can also be demonstrated visually in heat-map style. Furthermore, MAP software can support the visualization for additional information at a time. For example, the left and right of the heat-map represent the sample name and mutational spectrum, respectively. The bottom of the heat-map represents the gene name by color for mutational spectrum. Frequency or p-value plots are represented on top of the heat-map (Fig. 2B and 2C). This graphical result can be exported into an image file for further investigation.
