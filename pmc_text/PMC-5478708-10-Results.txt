Aspirin versus DMSO
In the case of aspirin versus DMSO, four gene sets were enriched in aspirin-treated HDFs as compared with DMSO-treated HDFs. These gene sets consist of genes involved in the protein secretion, keratin filament and intermediate filament, and genes down-regulated in response to UV radiation (Table 6, Fig. 4A). Enriched genes in each gene set were shown in Supplementary Tables 12, 13, 14, 15.
On the other hand, three gene sets of C2:CP were enriched in DMSO-treated HDFs as compared with aspirin-treated HDFs: genes regulating prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and cardiomyopathy (Table 7). In addition, 34 gene sets of C5:BP, three gene sets of C5:CC and five gene sets of C5:MF were enriched in DMSO-treated HDFs as compared with aspirin-treated HDFs. These gene sets consist of genes involved in embryonic development, negative regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane, DNA-dependent RNA transcription, cell differentiation, glutamate receptor binding, or Smad binding (Tables 7 and 8, Fig. 4B). Of note, the gene set involved in platelet aggregation was enriched in DMSO-treated HDFs as compared with aspirin-treated HDFs (Table 8, FDR, 0.179). Enriched genes in representative gene sets were shown in Supplementary Tables 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
