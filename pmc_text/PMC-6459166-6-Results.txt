The first introns and the 2-kb upstream regions showed different enrichment patterns of epigenetic signals
It is a well-established principle that mutant alleles generated from functionally important sites show very low population-level frequencies. In other words, a MAF < 0.01 in the population, which is a common definition of a rare allele, is a good indicator of the functional importance of an allele. Therefore, we hypothesized that the number of sites with an MAF < 0.01 (i.e., the proportion of rare alleles) per unit of genomic length should be higher if a genomic region carries a greater quantity of functionally important sites. Under this hypothesis, we investigated differences in the distribution of the patterns with which rare alleles were assigned to epigenetic regulatory marks in the first introns and the 2-kb upstream region of genes. Interestingly, we found that most epigenetic signals located in the first introns carried a significantly greater proportion of rare alleles than those in the 2-kb upstream region, whereas the proportions of rare alleles assigned to CTCFs, DHSs, and TFBSs were more enriched in the 2-kb upstream region than in the first introns (Fig. 1A). However, it should be noted that the higher proportion of rare alleles in the first intron than in the 2-kb upstream regions was inconsistent for H3K4me3 signals across different cell types. These results may imply that the roles of epigenetic signals in the first introns and the 2-kb upstream region might be independent or complementary to each other. The three different Tier-1 cell lines yielded essentially the same results, although there were some slight differences among the cell lines.
