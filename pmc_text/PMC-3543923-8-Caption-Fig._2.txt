Comparison of average expression levels of all genes between two ethnic groups. The expression profile datasets of the International HapMap populations (European [CEU] and African [YRI]) measured in lymphoblastoid cell lines were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO accession no. GSE6536). For each of the 19,723 genes, the log-transformed expression levels of both 60 YRI and 60 CEU individuals were averaged and plotted on the x- and y-axis, respectively.
