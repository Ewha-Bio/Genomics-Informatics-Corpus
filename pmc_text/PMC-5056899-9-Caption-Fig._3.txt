Impact of Alu insertion on alternative transcription. Alu element inserting in the genic region could alter the expression level of the respective gene. (A) Alu insertion in the exonic region. Exons could be skipped and deleted, called exon skipping. (B) Alu insertion in the genic region, Alu element is able to provide a polyadenylation signal. Thus, Alu element could induce the premature termination of gene transcription. (Câ€“E) Alu element is also able to provide cryptic splicing sites, leading to alternative gene transcripts. Blue and red boxes indicate exon and Alu element. Arrow shows promoter and the dash line indicates alternative splicing form.
