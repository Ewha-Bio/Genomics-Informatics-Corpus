Recently, many genetic association studies have sought larger sample sizes for various reasons, such as the rapid decline of sequencing costs and small effect sizes [1]. The computational complexity required to analyze such datasets has in turn become larger; hence, many researchers have developed novel association analysis methods by adopting additional information to reasonably reduce the dimension of datasets [2, 3]. In this respect, we have proposed the PHARAOH method, which is a computationally efficient method that can analyze large-scale genetic datasetsâ€”for example, thousands of samples with millions of variants [4]. By applying doubly penalized regression to the hierarchical model that mimics the underlying biological structure from genes to the phenotype via pathways, we have demonstrated that the proposed method can handle substantial correlations between pathways but analyzes large-scale datasets within a reasonable time with superior statistical power.
However, it is also important that a widely used method is easy to use, in addition to its methodological advantages. In that regard, the PHARAOH program lacks accessibility to researchers, based on limited support of file formats and the absence of integrated quality control processes and computational flexibility. To address this problem, we introduce an updated PHARAOH program that is integrated with our recently published all-in-one genetic workbench, WISARD [5]. WISARD is a powerful workbench that accepts a broad range of input formats and provides extensive quality control measures that can be calculated and used to filter out samples or variants, before the various analyses that WISARD supports. By using the advantages of WISARD, we integrated three features of WISARD into the PHARAOH program: input format support, quality control, and multithreading.
