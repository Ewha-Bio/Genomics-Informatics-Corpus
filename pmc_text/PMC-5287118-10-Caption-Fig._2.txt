Venn diagrams give us shared parts from 5-fold CV by variables selection methods. CV, cross-validation; ASIAN-100, genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog (Asia) + singlesingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis; KOREAN-100, GWAS catalog (Korea) + single-SNP analysis; ALL-200, GWAS catalog (All) + single-SNP analysis; ASIAN-200, GWAS catalog (Asia) + single-SNP analysis; KOREAN-200, GWAS catalog (Korea) + single-SNP analysis; GWAS-ALL, GWAS catalog (All); GWAS-ASIAN, GWAS catalog (Asia); SLR, stepwise linear regression; LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; EN, Elastic-Net.
