Pharmacological analysis
The pharmacological properties and bioactivities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin were determined using various pharmacological methods. Pharmacological properties including the test based on Lipinskiâ€™s rule of five [25], bioactivity, drug likeliness, Ames toxicity, and the antibacterial properties were studied. Moreover, the ADMET test, the MRDD and other analyses were also studied using in silico assays with a variety of softwares such as SwissADME [26], ACD/I-Lab [27], Molinspiration, and FAF Drugs [28].
