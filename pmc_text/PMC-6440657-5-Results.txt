De novo assembly
To study the transcriptome of C. japonicum, three tissues, viz., flowers, leaves, and roots, were extracted, and the RNA was isolated. The total RNA from each sample was used for the mRNA preparation, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis and library preparation. De novo assembly was selected since a reference genome for C. japonicum is lacking. Each library was sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2500 platform. The platform generated 74,566,546 raw reads for C. japonicum for the whole transcriptome, which accounted for 18Gbases of sequence data (Supplementary Table 1). These data were further subjected to a quality check and adaptor trimming (using the trimmomatic 0.30 tool), generating 67,153,874 high-quality paired end reads (Tables 1 and 2). Then, an error correction of the data was performed, and 66,078,302 reads were obtained. The paired end sequencing yielded on average a 64× sequencing depth. The mean Phred value was above 20, and the short reads (>50) were removed. The whole transcriptome was assembled using the Trinity program, resulting in 51,133 unigenes, accounting for 37 Mbases, with a mean size of 648.36 bp. The length distribution of all unigenes is shown in Fig. 1. The GC content was distributed within 42%–45%. The minimum size of the transcripts was 147 bp, whereas the maximum size was 15,402 bp (Table 1).
