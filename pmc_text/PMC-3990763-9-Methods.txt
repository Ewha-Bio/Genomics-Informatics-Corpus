Clustering
We provide a clustering method to group the patients in the similarity space. The clustering is used to enhance the visibility of patients in the space as the groups who are potentially sharing similar genomic properties. In addition, by using a filtering method, the analysts can quickly filter out unwanted clusters for clearer views of the population. We applied the k-means++ clustering algorithm [33] in the implementation. The algorithm was chosen because of its ability of choosing the initial values (or "seeds") for the popular k-means clustering algorithm and thus avoiding the sometimes poor clustering outcomes found by the standard k-means algorithm. The number of clusters can be specified via a menu. Fig. 6 shows an example of the visualization of the entire patient population who are painted with 4 colors corresponding to 4 clusters.
