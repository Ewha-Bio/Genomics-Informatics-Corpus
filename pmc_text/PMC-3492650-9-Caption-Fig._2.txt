Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)-histone modifications and gene expression profile. (A) Gene expression level and histone modification enrichment. Inserts are Pearson correlation coefficients (r). (B) Gene expression level and histone H3K4me3 enrichment. (C) Gene expression level and histone H3K9/14ac enrichment. (D) Gene ontology (GO) analysis for top 30% ranked expressed genes in H3K9/14ac enrichment. (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis for top 30% ranked expressed genes in H3K9/14ac enrichment. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase.
