Capture design
The 30 genes known to be mutated in lung cancer were chosen for targeted resequencing (Table 1). The 701 coding regions in 30 genes covered 102 kb according to the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) database. Capture sequences to achieve redundant coverage over the coding regions were chosen based on length (100-1,000 bp) and GC content (20-65%) and to avoid repetitive genomic elements in the ends. After analysis of in silico-digested restriction fragments of the target regions, the best combinations of restriction enzymes were selected to provide over 99% coverage of targeted bases.
