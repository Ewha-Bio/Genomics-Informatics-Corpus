This study showed that rs1800871 and rs1800872 of IL10 were marginally associated with the prognosis in NHL. Especially among the subtypes of NHL, these two polymorphisms had a decreased risk with the minor allele for DLBCL. It suggests that IL10 polymorphisms might be prognostic indicators for such patients.
There have been many reports on the relationship between IL10 gene polymorphisms and the risk of lymphoma, including meta-analyses. These studies reported that IL10 (rs1800890, rs1800896, rs1800871, and rs1800872) polymorphisms are associated with the risk of NHL.
These polymorphisms had a significantly increased risk for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma [1112]. These results showed the opposite effects compared with our study. However, all of the polymorphisms were not associated with the risk of NHL. In another study, the rs1800896 reference allele was associated with an increased risk of NHL. On the other hand, rs1800871 and rs1800872 had no association with the risk of NHL [13].
For an association with clinical outcomes, a previous study reported that IL10 gene polymorphisms influenced OS in T-cell lymphoma NHL [14]. In another study, IL10 genotypes were associated with a lower production of anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines as a factor influencing an unfavorable course of NHL [15]. However, the other study showed no difference of allele frequencies between lymphoma patients and healthy controls, and moreover, they did not show any association of OS or event-free survival with IL10 genotypes [16].
Our study has several limitations. Our study has a limited number of patients. Furthermore, these subtypes, such as mantle cell lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma, were not common, and fewer studies reported an association between IL10 gene polymorphisms and these subtypes. Therefore, the sample size was limited, and the statistical power may be insufficient.
Although our study has a limited number of patients, it gave us implications for the association of IL10 genotypes and the prognosis of B-cell lymphoma treated by R-CHOP, which is a standard therapy. Thus, we need to further study this on a large scale to confirm these results.
