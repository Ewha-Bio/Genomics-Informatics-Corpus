Structure prediction and validation of kir6.2 structural models
The primary sequence of kir6.2 (UniProt ID, Q14654) is a transmembrane protein with 390 amino acid residues. Ten mutations [10] were introduced in the primary sequence of kir6.2 for mutant model prediction purposes. Two tertiary structural models were predicted for both wild (template PDB ID, 3JYC) and mutant-type kir6.2 (template PDB ID, 3SYA) separately using Phyre2 [13] with 100% confidence, followed by energy minimization using ModRefiner [14] web server. The structural model of kir6.2 is publically available in the Protein Model DataBase (PMID ID, PM0079770). The quality of the model was compared with three existing models of kir6.2 available in the Protein Model Portal (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/query/uniprot/Q14654). The first model available in the Protein Model Portal was done for the amino acid region of 179-351, taking template PDB ID 1U4F, chain C with a 53% identity score. However, this model is not complete in comparison to the present predicted model of kir6.2 (PMID, PM0079770), which is modeled from amino acid region 33-358. The second and third models available are almost complete and modeled for the same amino acid region as in the present model of wild kir6.2. While comparing the quality with all experimentally determined protein chains in the current PDB using the ProSA web server [15] by means of a significant statistical score (z-score) in terms of folding energy, the second and third models had a z-score computed in the ProSA web server of -5.16 (Supplementary Fig. 2B) and -5.6 (Supplementary Fig. 2C), respectively, while in comparison, the current model had a good folding energy score-i.e., z-score of -5.96 (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The overall quality factors of these two models were also compared with the current predicted model of kir6.2 using Errat2. The overall quality factor for the second and third models deposited in the Protein Model Portal was computed to be 69.132 (Supplementary Fig. 3B) and 67.508 (Supplementary Fig. 3C), respectively, which is quite poor in comparison to the quality score of 78.778 (Supplementary Fig. 3A) computed for the current model of kir6.2 (PM0079770). Again, superimposition of the second model (blue color) available in Protein Model Portal and the present model of kir6.2 (red color) also gives a clear-cut idea of the quality of the model presented here (Supplementary Fig. 4). The quality of the backbone folding pattern of the present model (Supplementary Fig. 5A) in comparison to the third model available in Protein Model Portal (Supplementary Fig. 5B) is also good. From the above, it is found that the model predicted here for kir6.2 is good in comparison to all three existing models available in Protein Model Portal.
