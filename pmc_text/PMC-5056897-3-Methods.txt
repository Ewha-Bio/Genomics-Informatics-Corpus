Physicochemical parameterization
Physicochemical properties of the proteins help in deducing the biochemical characteristics of the proteins and functional characterization. We used Expassy's ProtParam [24] server for estimation of physicochemical parameters of the HPs. ProtParam server is equipped with modules that are capable of predicting an array of physicochemical properties using predefined formulas and experimental inferences. We predicted relative molecular weight, theoretical pI, extinction coefficient, instability index, aliphatic index, and grand average of the hydropathicity of the HPs using ProtParam. All these properties help in identifying the probable function of the proteins. Data for physicochemical parameterization are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
