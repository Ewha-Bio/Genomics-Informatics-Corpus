Evaluation of heterogeneity in COPD data
In a previous study by Kim et al. [10], 1,420 DEGs between COPD and normal subjects were identified by student’s t-test and edgeR in Biocoductor [24]. To see the Euclidean distance and relatedness between COPD and normal subjects, PCA was performed (Fig. 1A). In a three-dimensional data space, it was hard to distinguish COPD samples from normal samples. Moreover, three principal components explained less than one-half of the variability between samples (PC1, 0.422; PC2, 0.069; and PC3, 0.047). These results revealed 8 heterogeneity in the COPD samples and indicated that simple conventional DEG comparison was not enough to classify the samples.
To identify the status of COPD samples, the average expression levels of known COPD marker genes were examined (Fig. 1B) [25-31]. Genes encoding acute phase proteins, such as fibrinogen α (FGA) and fibrinogen γ (FGG), were up-regulated in COPD. The expression levels of the immune cytokines interleukin 6 (IL6) and CXCL8 (IL8) were also increased. Genes of immune receptors associated with smoking were highly expressed in COPD than in normal samples. However, the extent of changes was generally less than 2-fold, suggesting that these COPD samples were in the mild stage of COPD. Unusually, the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF; TNF-α) and CSF2 (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) were lower in COPD, which was different from previous observations [27,28].
By analyzing RNA-seq data, it was possible to measure recombination events in BCR and TCR loci. VJ recombination occurs in the primary lymphoid organs and involves the joining of the variable (V) and joining (J) chains, resulting in the variation of amino acid sequences in the antigen-binding regions of BCRs and TCRs. By using IgBlast [14], frequent VJ recombination events in the immunoglobulin K (IGK) locus were identified. Alpha diversity represents how many components constitute a particular complex within a sample. In contrast, beta diversity is the compositional dissimilarity between samples. The alpha diversity levels of the IGK locus indicated that COPD samples contained marginally higher combinatorial diversity than normal samples (Fig. 1C). Besides, beta diversity levels showed lower similarity between COPD samples compared with normal samples (Fig. 1D). Normal samples were more similar to each other than to COPD samples. Other immunoglobulins (IGH and IGL) and TCRs (TCRA and TCRB) showed similar patterns in alpha and beta diversity levels as IGK (Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). From these analyses, the COPD samples could be regarded 9 as heterogeneous in the mild stage of COPD.
