The Manhattan plot ofâ€“log10(p-value) including total analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (A) and transcript capacity (TC) (B) under p-value < 0.05 across chromosomes. The P-value was obtained from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the SNPs and those encompassing genes. TC was calculated using the GWAS beta effect and transcript per million reads.
