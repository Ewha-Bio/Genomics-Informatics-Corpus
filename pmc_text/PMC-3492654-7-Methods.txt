Statistical analysis
The chi-square test for association was used to test differences of genotype frequencies between normal and gastric cancer patients. Odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) in relation to MTHFR, MTTRR, and MTR genotypes were calculated. Also, after adjustment for sex, family history, smoking, drinking, and H. pylori infection, global chi-square test was also employed to calculate OR and their 95% CIs for individuals. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
