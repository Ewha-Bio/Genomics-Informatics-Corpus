Conserved domain search and annotation
The CDS sequences contain information about conserved domains. Domains are regarded as distinct functional and structural units, and the units can be repeated in similar protein structures [7]. The domains that are repeated in viruses in Caliciviridae can be utilized with a standard to identify the viruses in the genus level. By extracting the conserved domains, the final protein sequence that can be used to identify specific viruses can be selected. CDD was utilized to collect and assign annotations for the conserved domains [3].
By the technical method, we used reverse position-specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST). RPS-BLAST is the tool to search a protein sequence against a database of profiles, which are collected conserved domains. This tool is the opposite of PSI-BLAST searching a profile against a database of protein sequences. In this study, the database is composed as Table 1.
For the viruses in Calicivirdae, the conserved domains were almost defined by RPS-BLAST with Pfam database. Pfam database is generated by multiple sequence alignment and Hidden Markov models [8]. Generally, proteins structures are made by the combination of the domain units. To search common domain from each protein structure among the domains, there would provide some clues to identify the similar function and search the specific sequence for each protein. As we know, we cannot beg the question that the proteins have the similar functions even if protein sequences have the high similarity from the comparison between sequences. However, if we approach from the view of the conserved domain of protein structure as above the method (Fig. 1), we can find the specific domain for each protein and the domain can give help to define the specific sequences between the viruses in the same taxonomy.
