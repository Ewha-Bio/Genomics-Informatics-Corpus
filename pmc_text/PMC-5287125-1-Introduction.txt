The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies has steadily increased during recent decades in many regions. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the most frequent hematologic cancer type, accounting for 43% of all hematologic malignancies and 90% of lymphomas [1]. In Korea, the incidence of NHL is approximately 10.8 per 100,000 persons per year [2]. The risk of NHL is increased by age, chronic infection, and genetic and environmental factors [3].
The frequency of B-cell lymphoma is higher than that of T-cell lymphoma in NHL, and the survival rate of B-cell lymphoma has continuously improved. The prognosis varies, depending on patient age, clinicopathological features, and genetic factors. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) is the most commonly used tool to predict the prognosis of NHL [45]. However, its efficiency could be enhanced by the inclusion of additional prognostic markers.
Interleukin-10 (IL-10), one of the Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokines, is mainly secreted by type 2 helper T-cells (Th2) and activates T-cells and monocytes, as well as B lymphocytes. IL-10 can promote cancer by immunosuppression or stimulation of cell proliferation (B-cells and Th2-cells) and plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation by suppressing the release and function of Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines [6]. Recent evidence suggests that the imbalance of the Th1/Th2 response induced by genetic variants affects the pathogenesis of NHL [7]. These findings indicate that IL10 polymorphism may be a principal mediator cytokine in the pathogenesis of NHL.
The IL10 gene is positioned on chromosome 1 (1q31â€“1q32). Previous studies have revealed that the transcription of IL10 mRNA and its protein expression may be influenced by some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region, including rs1800896, rs1800871, and rs1800872 [78].
However, the impact of polymorphisms of the IL10 gene on NHL prognosis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the association between IL10 polymorphisms and NHL prognosis.
