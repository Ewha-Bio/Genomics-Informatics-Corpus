Study subjects and diagnostic criteria for OF
A total of 10,038 participants from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) were recruited. Among the recruited individuals, 1,537 subjects, consisting of 299 OF cases and 1,238 normal controls, who agreed to an X-ray examination were genotyped with the NimbleGen HD2 3 Ã— 720K comparative genomic hybridization array (aCGH). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and written informed consent was provided to all participants, including cases and controls. The clinical characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table 1. We used low trauma fracture events to distinguish between fracture and non-fracture groups of the KARE study. Fractures were only included if they had occurred with low trauma (e.g., fall from standing height or less) at any of six sites (hip, wrist, humerus, rib, pelvis, and vertebra) after the age of 40 years. Fractures clearly caused by high trauma events (e.g., motor vehicle accidents, violence, or falls from more than the standing height of the individual) were excluded.
