Detection of disulfide bridges
DISULFIND (http://disulfind.dsi.unifi.it/) server was used to predict the presence of any disulfide bond state between cysteine residues in the amino acid sequences of HPs. Moreover, disulfide bridges play a key role in the stabilization of the folding process for many proteins. We analyzed the data using this software. The disulfide bridges are very important finding in the study of structural and functional properties of specific proteins [21].
