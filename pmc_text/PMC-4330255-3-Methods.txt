Statistical analysis
To find significant SNPs, we used PLINK, version 1.07 [6]. Other statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.1. We used logistic regression to find major factors related with hepatitis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)/area under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to confirm the prediction power of the major factors that were found.
