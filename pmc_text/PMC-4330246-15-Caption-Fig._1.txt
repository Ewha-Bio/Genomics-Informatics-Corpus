The non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) events between paired low-copy repeats (LCRs)/segmental duplications (SDs) [1]. Paired LCRs/SDs are depicted as bold arrows (red and blue) with the orientation indicated by arrowheads. Capital letters near the LCRs/SDs refer to the flanking unique sequences, while the same letter on different lines indicates the homologues on the other strand. Dashed crossed lines represent a homologous recombination event. (A) The NAHR event between reversely oriented LCRs/SDs can cause inversion, a copy-neutral structural variation. (B) The inter-chromatid NAHR events between directly oriented LCRs/SDs result in deletions and duplications. (C) The intra-chromatid NAHR events between directly oriented LCRs/SDs can generate deletions and ring-shaped DNA segments that will be lost in subsequent cell divisions.
