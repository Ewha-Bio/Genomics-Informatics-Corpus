Simulation studies
In this simulation study, we compared true positive rates of three group testing procedures and one selection procedure such as PCA, Hotelling's T2 test, permutation test, and group lasso selection procedure when the same number of genes is identified by four statistical methods. We conducted two different simulation studies, where the first simulation assumed that all genes are independent with each other and the second simulation assumed that genes are correlated with each other according to a given network information.
In the first simulation studies, we assumed that a single gene consists of 5 genetic sites. Numerical data of the five genetic sites within the same gene were generated from a multivariate normal distribution of N(µ,Σ), where a mean vector µ has a different value between cases and controls if the gene is causal, but µ has the same value between cases and controls if the gene is noncausal. The covariance matrix Σ represents a correlation pattern of the five genetic sites within the same gene and we assumed an AR(1) correlation matrix, i.e., ∑={σij}1≤i,j≤5=ρi−j, where ρ is a correlation coefficient fixed as ρ=0.3,0.5, or 0.7 in the simulation. We considered 1,000 genes so we have a total of 5,000 genetic sites in the simulation data, where 100 cases and 100 controls were generated. Only 20 genes out of 1,000 genes are assumed to be causal. Note that the simulated 1,000 genes are independent with each other.
Three group testing procedures were applied to individual genes and the p-values of testing the mean difference between cases and controls were computed for 1,000 genes. The p-values of each testing procedure were then listed from the smallest to the largest. Finally, top 20, 30, and 40 genes were selected for each testing procedure based on the 20, 30, and 40 smallest p-values, respectively. In contrast, group lasso procedure sequentially selects the most outcome-related genes as a tuning parameter for sparsity is decreasing. Since we can easily control the tuning parameter value, we were able to select the top 20, 30, and 40 genes. True positives rate of the selected genes from the four statistical methods were computed along with two different values of µ=0.3 and 0.4. That is, only 20 causal genes were assumed to have a mean difference by either 0.3 or 0.4 between cases and controls. True positive rates stand for the proportion of correctly identified genes among the 20 causal genes. The simulation was repeated 100 times and averaged true positive rates of four statistical methods over 100 simulation replications were summarized in Fig. 1.
In Fig. 1, it appears that all of true positive rates are overall increased as the mean difference is increasing and the correlation coefficient is decreasing. In high-dimensional data analysis, it is often observed that detection power is decreased due to highly correlated variables. We can see the similar result of decreased true positive rates for highly correlated genetic sites. When we compared four statistical methods, both PCA and permutation test seem to have the largest true positive rates in all simulation settings, while Hotelling's T2 test show the lowest true positive rates in all settings. The true positive rates of group lasso procedure seem to be higher than those of Hotelling's T2 test, but slightly lower than those of both PCA and permutation test. Consequently, we can conclude that group lasso procedure shows similar selection performance as the group hypothesis testing procedures in the first simulation study.
In the second simulation study, we generated 1,000 genes where each 100 genes are truly correlated with each other according to the simulated genetic network in Fig. 2. So, we have 10 network groups each of which consists of 100 genes. Similar to the first simulation study, genetic data was generated from N(µ,Σ), where the covariance matrix Σ is an inverse of a precision matrix Ω In a Gaussian graphical model [17], nonzero entries of the precision matrix correspond to links between two genes of a network graph. Therefore, we could obtain the precision matrix Ω according to the given network in Fig. 2 in the same way described [1218]. Our simulation data consists of 100 cases and 100 controls over 1,000 genes, where only 45 genes within the same network have a different mean µ between cases and controls. Let us denote the j-th gene by χj . Since our simulation study should be conducted for genetic sites with a group structure, we additionally generated 10 genetic sites for each gene. If the first N genetic sites among 10 sites are causal and the other 10 - N genetic sites are noncasual, the N sites of the the j-th gene were generated such that χjk = χj + N(0,σ2), k = 1, 2, …, N and χjk = N(0,σ2) for k = N + 1, …, 10. Finally, we have a total of 10,000 genetic sites with 200 samples. In the simulation, we discarded all simulated genes χj for j = 1, 2, …, 1,000. Instead, we used only 10,000 genetic sites where each 10 sites consist of one gene. In this simulation setting, 10 genetic sites within the same gene are not only correlated with each other, but they are also correlated with the other 10 genetic sites within the different genes that are linked with each other according to the genetic network.
We also applied four statistical methods used in the first simulation study. We fixed the number of causal genetic sites per gene as N = 2, 5, or 10. Since only 45 genes are causal, the number of causal sites is 90, 225, or 450 among 10,000 sites, respectively. The standard deviation σ to control a noise level was set to be 1.5, 2, or 2.5. Higher standard deviation is likely to produce stronger noises, so true positive rates are expected to be decreased. Simulation was repeated 100 times and averaged true positive rates of top 10 genes to top 100 genes selected by four methods are summarized in Fig. 3.
In Fig. 3, PCA overall shows the best selection performance except when the noise level is either moderate or strong, and the number of causal genetic sites is small, i.e., N = 2 and σ= 2 or 2.5. As the number of causal sites in a gene is decreasing, the true positive rates of three group testing procedures seem to be decreasing together. However, we can see that the true positive rates of group lasso are almost the same regardless of the number of causal sites in a gene. As we mentioned earlier, group lasso enforces the regression coefficients of genetic sites in the selected genes to be nonzero even if only a few genetic sites are causal and majority is noncausal. In this reason, the selection performance of group lasso does not affected by the number of causal and noncausal sites in the same gene. When all of genetic sites in the same gene are causal (N = 10), both PCA and permutation test overwhelm the other two methods. Since computation of the test statistics of two methods is based on individual genetic sites, they should be statistically powerful when all of sites in the same gene are causal. In the second simulation, the Hotelling's T2 test shows the worst selection of true positives in all simulation settings. This is due to relatively high correlation among genetic sites in the same genes. We have already seen that the true positive rates of Hotelling's T2 test were drastically decreased as the correlation was increasing in the first simulation study.
