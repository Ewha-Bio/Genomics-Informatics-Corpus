Challenges of big data issues and integromics
More recently, systematic structuring and integration of multiple and multi-layered omics data resources, i.e. integromics, are thought of a state-of-the-art strategy. The recent establishment of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) could accelerate and facilitate the integration and sharing of cancer genome data [44]. Multi-layered integromics could define tumor heterogeneity, revealing pivotal aberrations of genetic events or signaling pathways [45]. In parallel, genomic repositories for drug activities have been established [46-48]. Linking the profiles of drug sensitivity to the cancer genome could provide a powerful platform to guide rational and personalized cancer therapeutics.
Now, as genomic data are increasing and accumulating enormously, new study designs and analysis strategies for integromics might be required, particularly with the context of tumor heterogeneity and the discovery of the functional biomarkers. As shown in Fig. 1, the first step in cancer integromics is the dissection of tumor heterogeneity. Then, the next step will be a recapitulation of the relations between clinical/biological phenotypes and molecular genotypes in cancer subpopulations, which can address novel functionalities in particular subpopulations of cancers. We suggest that the discovery of reliable candidate functional biomarkers as well as functional genetic alterations, so-called "driver events", can be achieved through performing this step-by-step evaluation of both clinical and functional utilities. This hybrid study design would open an exciting era for developing new "functional biomarkers" and preventive/therapeutic strategies with the consideration of biological backgrounds of tumor heterogeneity.
