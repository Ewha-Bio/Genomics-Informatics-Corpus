In this study, we confirmed that vascular disease and gastritis have considerable association in Korean males. We also verified that gastritis is affected by other various drugs. However, we could not find gastritis-specific biomarkers for diagnosis.
Gastritis has numerous causes and is distributed as variable subtypes by phenotype. So, correctly diagnosing it is very important for therapy. Gastritis has non-specific phenotypes that can obscure finding the disease causes. So, more information is also needed to analyze the complex factors associated with disease rather than each factor associated with the disease. For example, confirmation of H. pylori infection, tobacco, smoking period, and alcohol intake are considered. This needs further study.
