IRs induce complex CNVs by replication errors
During DNA replication, IRs could form DNA secondary structures, which will induce replication fork stalling. Template switching and replication resumption further result in CNV mutations (Fig. 2). Notably, replication-associated events usually lead to complex CNVs, which include the combined segments of deletions and duplications. As was reported, Chen et al. [59] identified three complex CNVs that could be explained by a model of serial replication slippage (SRS). In this model, IRs have the potential to induce SRS and cause CNV mutations.
IRs can induce complex CNVs, as observed in the MECP2 locus in chromosome Xq28 and the PLP1 locus in chromosome Xq22 [60]. To elucidate the mechanisms of complex CNVs in the PLP1 locus, Hastings et al. [61] found both microhomology and IRs at the breakpoints. They proposed that both breakage of replication forks and the IR-mediated aberrant repair process can result in complex CNVs. This model was termed 'microhomology-mediated break-induced replication,' which was used to explain the formation of the complex CNVs involving individual genes or even single exons [62].
