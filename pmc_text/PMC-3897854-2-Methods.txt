Subjects
This retrospective study included 168 epileptic Korean patients who received VPA at Sinchon and Gangnam Severance Hospitals. Forty-one patients demonstrated VPA dose-related ADRs in the central nervous system (dizziness, headache, somnolence, diplopia, dysarthria, tremor, etc.), while the remainder (n = 127) did not. Patients who were diagnosed with chronic active epilepsy, West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, progressive myoclonic epilepsy, tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, hamartoma, or brain tumors were excluded. There were no statistical differences in age, sex, response/non-response, and sclerosis between the two groups.
Demographic characteristics of the epileptic patients are presented in Table 1. DNA from control subjects (n = 110) was randomly selected from the DNA bank of the Korea Pharmacogenomics Research Network at Seoul National University. Blood samples were collected from each subject, and DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).
