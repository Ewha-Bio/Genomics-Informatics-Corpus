Experimental validation of transgenic inserts
Each of the 13 combination primer sets was designed congruent with the transgenic insertion region orientation. PCR was conducted using DNA polymerase (Solgent Co., Daejeon, Korea) following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was performed under the following conditions: a pre-denaturation step at 95℃ for 5 min; denaturation at 95℃ for 60 s; 30 amplification cycles, including annealing at 60℃ for 45 s, and elongation at 72℃ for 120 s; and a final elongation at 72℃ for 5 min.
