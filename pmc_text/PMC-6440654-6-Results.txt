To examine the significance of the HOTAIR expression in CVD patients, we tested 20 blood samples from CVD patients and 20 control samples. The mean age of patients was 53.95 years at the time of CAD diagnosis and control samples average ages was 50 years old.
Size of products for GAPDH and HOTAIR were controlled on 2% agarose gel. The 143-bp PCR product attributed to amplified GAPDH fragment was visualized in all the control and patient’s samples while 19 out of 20 of case samples (95%) demonstrated HOTAIR PCR product. However, only 3 normal samples showed the band for HOTAIR on the agarose gel. The results indicated that the expression level of HOTAIR was higher in CAD patients (Fig. 1) compared to non-CAD patients. Unpaired student t-test showed that the relative expression of HOTAIR in CVD patient’s blood sample was significantly higher than the controls (Fig. 2) (fold change, 4.710; p < 0.0001). Also, HOTAIR expression in CVD patient and control samples were analyzed based on their age and gender. We categorized HOTAIR lncRNA expression based on gender and age. There were no significant differences of HOTAIR expression between groups.
