Genome browser
Constructing a custom genome browser with a reference genome sequence is the first step. After selecting one of the genome browsers configured in IVAG, various types of genomic data, including GTF, GFF3, BAM, BED, BigWig, and VCF, can be uploaded and visualized all together (Fig. 2G). Also, this genome browser receives RNA-seq and GWAS results generated from IVAG as inputs.
