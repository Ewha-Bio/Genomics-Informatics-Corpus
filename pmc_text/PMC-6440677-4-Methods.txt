Evaluation of database accuracy
Due to each database having different update dates and different ways of constructing taxonomies, we first modified the taxonomy mentioned in the original paper to match the taxonomy corresponding to each database. We modified the names to be as equal as possible to the species level, but when no corresponding names were found, we chose the most similar taxonomy for each database. For example, the Erwinia chrysanthemi mentioned in the paper was converted to Dickeya chrysanthemi, because the name was no longer valid in the Silva and EzBioCloud databases. Here, we measured the accuracy of taxonomic assignments using the previously published method of Edgar [10]. We calculated the following values: N, the number of correct names; M, the number of predicted names; TP, the number of true positives; FP, the number of false-positives; and FN, the number of false-negatives. Unlike in the original paper, we evaluated the taxonomic assignments at the genus and species levels. In addition, we estimated how much the evenness was reproduced by calculating the value of alpha diversity, based on the assumption that the mock community was made to have an even distribution.
