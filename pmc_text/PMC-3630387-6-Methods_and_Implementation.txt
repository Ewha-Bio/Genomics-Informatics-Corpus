Standardization and hit scoring
A unified scoring scheme is employed that accounts for batch effects from multiday experiments. Under the assumption of normality, the Z-score, which indicates how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean, is an intuitive scoring metric. However, it is sensitive to biological outliers (hits) in the data pool, resulting in deflated scores. An alternative is to use the robust Z-score, which is a measure of the median absolute deviation from the median. siMacro calculates the Z-score and the robust Z-score from the user-provided unit of experiment: e.g., the day, cell batch, or plate. siMacro takes the mean of log2-transformed normalized values from replicates for the calculation. For a 2-condition synthetic phenotype screen, the log2 ratio between the 2 conditions is used per siRNA to calculate the Z and the robust Z-scores for a synthetic effect. siMacro returns output, including individual and mean normalized values, Z-score, robust Z-score, and flags, for the censored bad wells directly onto the Excel data sheet as additional columns (Fig. 1D).
