Numerous bioinformatics programs have been developed for RNA-seq data analysis. Even tools developed for a same purpose are based on distinct approaches using different algorithms and models. The diversity of the methodology makes it possible to customize analysis protocols by choosing a program that provides the best fit to each specific goal. In this review, we described the routine RNA-seq analysis workflow, focusing on transcriptome reconstruction and expression quantification, and also introduced its related bioinformatics programs. Therefore, we expect that this review will be helpful for preparing a specific pipeline for RNA-seq data analysis, enabling to design new biological experiments.
