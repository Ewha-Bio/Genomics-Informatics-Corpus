In this paper, we reviewed three different types of HMMs and their applications in order of the complexity of the hidden states, from a purely computational perspective. HMMs provide a sound mathematical framework for modeling and analyzing epigenetic data. The appropriate method for the analysis of DNA methylation depends upon the goals of the study. Researchers can design the most appropriate HMMs for their specific research needs and continued improvements in analysis methods make the study of DNA methylation more accessible.
