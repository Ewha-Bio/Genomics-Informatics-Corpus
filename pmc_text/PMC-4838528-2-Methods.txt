Data collection and processing
Infinium 450K HumanMethylation array
More than 5,600 samples from 11 datasets were collected from GEO [2]. Before data integration, we calculated the average beta value for measuring methylation levels at each CpG site, ranging from 0 (least methylated) to 1 (most methylated). The individual beta value was dropped if the detection p-value was over 0.05. For all datasets, raw signal intensity files were collected, and from them, methylation level was calculated as β = (max(Cy5, 0)) / (|Cy3| + |Cy5| + 100). A constant of 100 was added to the denominator to regularize β values when both unmethylated and methylated intensities were small.
Affymetrix U133Plus2 array
A total of 1,819 samples from 4 datasets for gene expression experiments using the Affymetrix U133Plus2 array were obtained from GEO [2]. For all datasets, CEL files were collected and normalized by Robust Multiarray Average method [8].
