Genomic disorders and low-copy repeats
Large-scale genomic changes in the human genome can be associated with human diseases. Such clinical conditions resulting from human genome architecture are termed 'genomic disorders' [1]. The structural features, such as genomic repeats, can provide substrates for homologous recombination and induce genomic rearrangements and genomic disorders.
Stankiewicz and Lupski [6] defined region-specific lowcopy repeats (LCRs) as paralogous genomic segments spanning 10-400 kb of genomic DNA and sharing â‰¥95%-97% sequence identity. The non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between directly oriented LCRs can generate microdeletions and microduplications of megabases in size, which are frequently associated with genomic disorders (Fig. 1). For example, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a well-investigated disorder caused by microdeletions between the paired LCRs in human 22q11.2, which deletes one copy of TBX1, CRKL, MAPK1, and several additional genes [7, 8, 9, 10]. In addition to microdeletions, microduplications can also manifest as genomic disorders. The 1.4-Mb microduplication involving the PMP22 gene in human 17p12 can lead to CMT1A, which is a classical model for disease resulting from gene dosage effects [11, 12].
