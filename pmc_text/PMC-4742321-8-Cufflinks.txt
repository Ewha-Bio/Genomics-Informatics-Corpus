The Tuxedo package is the most widely used software for transcript assembly and quantification using RNA-seq and consists of a number of different programs, including TopHat, Cufflinks, and Cuffdiff [31]. In the initial step, TopHat is employed for mapping raw RNA-seq reads to a reference genome, where some reads can be spliced when they were aligned on the exon-exon junctions of transcripts. These mapped reads are provided as input to Cufflinks for transcript assembly and abundance estimation. Transcript assembly is achieved by building an overlap graph from the mapped reads followed by computing minimal path cover in the overlap graph, generating a minimum number of transcripts that will explain all reads in the graph. Abundance estimation is performed by estimating the maximum likelihood abundance based on transcript coverage and compatibility together with the use of fragment length distribution. Abundances are reported in fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments (FPKM) for paired-end and RPKM for a single-end. Cuffdiff, a part of the Cufflinks package, also uses the mapped reads to report genes and transcripts that are differentially expressed. CummeRbund can produce figures and plots from the Cuffdiff outputs.
