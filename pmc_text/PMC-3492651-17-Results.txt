KDO abrogated the anti-inflammatory properties of 8-Br
Supplementary Table 5 shows the genes regulated upon double-ligand treatment with KDO and 8-Br. Importantly, combined KDO and 8-Br application increased the transcription of Tnf but did not affect Ccl4, Map3k8, or c-Myc (Fig. 3A). Since 8-Br downregulated these genes during the single-ligand application studies, these results suggested that the KDO-induced pathway attenuated these 8-Br-induced changes. We classified the direct targets of CREB (major TF induced by cAMP analogs) and NF-κB (direct target of KDO) to see which of the major transcription factors are affected (Table 2). For CREB, we searched in the website developed by Marc Montminy, which takes advantage of CHIP-on-chip data (http://natural.salk.edu/CREB). For potent NF-κB sites, we looked in the website http://www.bu.edu/nf-kb. Surprisingly, both of these transcription factors are not affected by double ligand treatment of KDO and 8-Br, reinsisting that KDO directly inhibits 8-Br-induced changes. CREB can be induced to a certain extent through the ERK pathway by KDO; however, such a claim remains to be proven in the future studies. This approach further raises a question on by which mechanism, if not CREB and NF-κB, KDO attenuates 8-Br induced changes, which also remains to be tested. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that KDO stimulation rapidly downregulated the 8-Br-induced increase in intracellular cAMP through the action of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that transform cAMP into inactive AMP [38]. In support of this idea, LPS stimulation of mouse peripheral leukocytes induced Pde4b mRNA accumulation and increased PDE4 activity [39]. This increase in PDE4 activity leads to a decrease in cAMP, thus removing the cAMP constraint and allowing for full induction of Tnf mRNA. PKA phosphorylation inhibits Raf1 directly [40, 41], and this inhibition occurs downstream of Ras [42, 43] to inhibit Ras-dependent signaling to ERK [44]. Hence, Raf can be the crosstalk point between the KDO and 8-Br signal transduction pathways.
