Oligonucleotide array fabrication and annotation
Mouse oligonucleotide arrays were fabricated with 15,631 oligomers that were 65 bp or 70 bp long. The oligomers were purchased from Operon (Huntsville, AL, USA) and Sigma-Genosys (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were inkjet-printed onto glass slides by Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The list of genes is available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GPL254.
