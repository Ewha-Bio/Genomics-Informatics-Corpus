In the past decade, gastric cancer has become of the most common malignancies worldwide. Despite significant improvements in screening and treatment technologies for gastric cancer, it remains the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths [1]. An accurate biomarker for detection of gastric cancer may reduce the cancer-related mortality. Although conventional strategies for blood-based biomarker discovery have shown promise, the development of clinically validated cancer detection markers remains an unmet challenge for many common human cancers [2]. New approaches that can complement and improve on current strategies for cancer detection are urgently needed.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a subset of non-coding RNA molecules (approximately 22 nucleotide in length) [3] that negatively regulate the protein expression of specific mRNAs by imperfectly base pairing together, resulting in protein translational repression of the target gene [4]. Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are involved in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [567]. Studies of miRNAs have been extended to many kinds of tumors [8] because altered expression of miRNAs has been demonstrated to play an important role in carcinogenesis, either by oncogenic [910] or tumor suppressor functions [1112].
For example, three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155) have been reported as oncogenic miRNAs. MiR-21, the most commonly up-regulated miRNA in both solid and hematological tumor tissues [813], directly targets tumor suppressors such as PTEN phosphatase, actin-binding protein tropomyosin I and reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motif [91415]. MiR-27a is an oncogenic miRNA in gastric adenocarcinoma, targeting prohibition [16], and genetic variant of miR-27a is associated with its expression and increased risk of various cancer [171819]. MiR-155 is frequently overexpressed in many cancer tissues and targets tumor protein p53 inducible nuclear protein 1 and FOXO3a [2021].
Previously, studies revealed that tumor-associated miRNAs are present in human plasma and serum in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity [2223], and can be readily detected in these blood fluids [242526]. In addition, it was demonstrated that the oncogenic miRNA expression levels in plasma and saliva were decreased in cancer patients post-surgery [27282930]. These findings suggest that miRNAs have the potential to be useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for cancer detection.
In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of these three miRNA variants in plasma samples from a screening cohort of 15 patients with gastric cancer and 15 healthy controls in Korean population. The significant miR-27a expression levels found were further validated in an additional 73 paired gastric cancer tissues and 70 plasma samples from Korean population, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
