Evolutionary conservation and genomic structure of miR-21-3p in various species
The conserved mature sequences of miR-21-3p in various species were analyzed by miRbase program. The 5´-CAGUCG-3´ sequences were highly conserved and indicated by shaded rectangles and marked with asterisk (Fig. 1). Using the ECR browser, evolutionary conservation of miR-21-3p was examined, indicating that miR-21-3p has been highly conserved from fishes to primates (Fig. 2). The structure of miR-21-3p was examined by mfold web server. The MFE value of miR-21-3p is ‒6.00 kcal/mol (Fig. 3).
