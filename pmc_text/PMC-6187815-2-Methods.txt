Antibacterial target protein retrieval and structural assessment
Topoisomerase II DNA gyrase is a well-known target protein for antibacterial studies, as also discussed in the introduction section above. The 3D structure of the topoisomerase II DNA gyrase enzyme (PDB ID: 2XCT) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank [19] and imported and prepared by a multistep process using the protein preparation wizard of the WHATIF server [20]. The protocol was used to obtain the optimized and minimized energy conformation of the target protein. The DNA gyrase structure was extracted from its complex form. Following the extraction of the structure, it was subjected to energy minimization using the implementation of the optimized potential for liquid simulation (OPLS-2005) force field with implicit solvation. After that, the DNA gyrase structure was assessed by Ramachandran plot [21] and Verify3D [22].
