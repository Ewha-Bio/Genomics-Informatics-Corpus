Enrichment analysis for SNP-based gene set
Ethnicity-specific HapMap SNPs were mapped to genes from UCSC RefGene (http://genome.ucsc.edu; ver. hg18) [12]. For the mapped genes, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID ver. 6.7) [13] with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, including biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF). The p-values were calculated for the probability of getting a set of genes within a given GO group.
