(A) Scattergram of specific antibody levels in sera from patients with NC, NC crossreacted to the sparganum extracts and sera from patients with sparganosis. Serum samples from NC cases showed the highest levels of reactivity against TsM CF. Some sparganosis sera revealed cross-reactions against TsM parenchymal extracts, but showed no crossreactions against TsM CF. (B) Immunoblot analysis of three different antigens (TsM CF, TsM parenchymal extracts, and sparganum extracts). Lanes a–c, sera from NC patients; lanes d–f, sera from sparganosis patients; lanes g–i, sera from NC cases cross-reacted with the sparganum extracts, lanes j–l, negative controls. NC, neurocysticercosis; TsM, Taenia solium metacestode; CF, cyst fluid; Mr, molecular weights in kDa.
