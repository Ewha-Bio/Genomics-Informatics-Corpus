Confirmation of PKD2 expression in Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEFs
Mouse Pkd2 mRNA was revealed in KO wild-type (KOWT) MEF cells but not in KO MEF cells. Also, Pkd2 mRNA was expressed in TG wild-type (TGWT) MEF cells and PKD2 TG MEF cells. Human PKD2 mRNA was only expressed in PKD2 TG MEF cells obtained from PKD2 TG embryos following injection of the human PKD2 transgene (Fig. 1A). Consistently, the expression level of polycystin-2 was lower in KO MEFs than KOWT MEFs as well as higher in TG MEFs than TGWT MEFs (Fig. 1B).
