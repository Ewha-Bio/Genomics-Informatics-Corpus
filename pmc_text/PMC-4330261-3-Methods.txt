Wild-type and mutant plasmid constructs
Human wild-type HNF1B, cloned in pCMV6b, was provided by Dr. J. Takeda, Gifu University, Japan. A point mutation was generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The promoter of human glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2) (-1296 to +312), cloned in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), was provided by Dr. M.S. Lee, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea. The sequences of all genes for the experiment were confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing.
