Comparison of mutation frequency between metastatic and non-metastatic cancer samples. Three cancer types-OV, GBM, and UCEC-were excluded, because the information on metastasis was not provided. The lines on the bar represent the standard deviation for the number of mutant genes per sample. The numbers on the dotted lines represent the value of the standard deviation in each sample. The significant difference between metastatic and nonmetastatic samples was considered based on the probability of t-test. **p < 0.01 and *p < 0.1. The numbers under the x-axis show the number of metastatic and non-metastatic samples in each cancer type. LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; OV, ovarian serous cy_stadenocarcinoma; THCA, thyroid carcinoma; HNSC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; KIRC, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma; COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; READ, rectum adenocarcinoma.
