Population and DNA extraction
The subjects in this study were collected from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) study, which has been described in detail previously [22]. Briefly, KARE consists of 2 community-based cohorts, Ansan (urban community) and Ansung (rural community) in Korea, and includes 10,038 participants aged 40 to 69 years. Genomic DNA of 1,920 male subjects randomly selected from the KARE study was extracted from cell lines immortalized with Epstein Bar virus.
