Screening and identification of DEGs
To identify the differentially ex pressed genes, the transcriptome data from C. japonicum leaf, root and flower tissues were analysed using the EdgeR package in R software [19]. The DEGs were visualized as an MA plot (log ratio vs. abundance plot) of flower vs. leaf, flower vs. root and leaf vs. root (Supplementary Fig. 1). The red dots represent transcripts with positive and negative log2fold change values, indicating the up-regulation and down-regulation of the DEGs in each comparison. Using these criteria, most transcripts were mapped in the leaf tissue (34,031), followed by the flower (24,663) and root (19,545) tissues (Table 2). The expression values corresponding to specific genes were arranged in a matrix form, and two tables of the counts and FPKM were generated to represent the genes (data not shown). The count matrix represented the number of reads mapped to the reference, and the FPKM matrix represented the normalized value using the FPKM-based count value. In total, 51,133 expressed reference sequences were obtained. Overall, the leaf (Cjapleaf) samples had the most expressed transcripts (46,991, 91.90%), followed by the flower (Cjapflower) (37,665, 73.66%) and root (Cjaproot) (32,257, 63.08%), as shown in Table 4. Based on the expression differences shown in the Venn diagram in Fig. 4, GO and KEGG analyses were performed again based on the nr database annotations. The unigenes were assigned to 61 GO categories as follows: Cjapleaf vs. Cjaproot (29,491 up-regulated and 27,898 down-regulated unigenes) (Supplementary Fig. 2); Cjaproot vs. Cjapflower (16,365 up-regulated and 32,596 down-regulated unigenes) (Supplementary Fig. 3) and Cjapflower vs Cjapleaf (19,207 up-regulated and 33,472 down-regulated unigenes) (Supplementary Fig. 4).
In the KEGG analysis, 2,615 unigenes were annotated in the Cjapleaf vs. Cjaproot comparison; of these unigenes, 2,115 up-regulated unigenes were assigned to 109 pathways, and 500 down-regulated unigenes were assigned to 113 pathways. In the comparison Cjaproot vs. Cjapflower, 877 unigenes were annotated in the KEGG classification; of these unigenes, 348 up-regulated unigenes were assigned to 103 pathways, and 529 down-regulated unigenes were assigned to 116 pathways. In the comparison Cjapflower vs. Cjapleaf, 934 unigenes were annotated; of these unigenes, 383 up-regulated unigenes were assigned to 97 pathways, and 551 down-regulated unigenes were assigned to 114 pathways. The differences in the expression levels were two-fold or greater, indicating a significant difference between the compared samples. The comparison of the up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts was performed by comparison among the tissues.
