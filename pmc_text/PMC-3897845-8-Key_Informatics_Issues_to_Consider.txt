Privacy
Individual genomic data are easily identifiable and can be used to predict current and future health status. Thus, extracting knowledge from large health data employs a significant risk of privacy information breach; thus, researchers need to consider Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) requirements for building a privacy-preserving and trustworthy database infrastructure and conducting research [28]. When personal genetics data can be incorporated into EMR systems, different safeguards to ensure confidentiality will be required. A de-identified bio-data warehouse combining traditional clinical and genomic information will be essential to conduct translational research.
