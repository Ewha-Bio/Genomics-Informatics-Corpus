Preparing SNP sets
The association of T2D was analyzed using logistic regression with adjustments for age, sex, area, and BMI as covariates. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1A, the quantile-quantile plot shows that the observed p -values at the tail are significantly larger than the null distribution. Six SNPs in CDKAL1 had associations that reached a genome-wide significance level of p-value less than 1.45 × 10−7 (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1B). Supplementary Table 1 shows the results with a p-value threshold of less than 5.00 × 10−5. rs7754840 (p = 4.66 × 10−8) of CDKAL1 and rs10811661 (p = 7.17 × 10−6) of CDKN2A/2B have been observed to affect T2D in previous GWASs [404142434445]. In the GWAS catalog, we found 65 SNPs and 25 SNPs associated with T2D in all populations and the Asian population, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). As previously mentioned, we categorized five SNP sets from two data sources in Table 2.
