Hypermethylated and downregulated genes in colorectal cancer
We used the discovery set (12 pairs of colorectal tumor and matched normal samples) to survey genes showing correlating differential DNA methylation and differential gene expression. All methylation probes (n = 27,578) were annotated by the name of the neighboring gene and were matched to the gene expression matrix. In order to look for the probes that were specifically hypermethylated only in tumors, we used the M-value of the methylation data; the median M of tumors (n = 12) was greater than 1, while the matched normal samples (n = 12) had a median M of less than -1. There were 634 such probes. We also identified 707 genes showing more than 4-fold downregulation in tumor samples compared to their matched normal samples. There were 31 genes that were shared by those two lists (Table 1). Fig. 1 shows the scatterplot of the mean differential methylation versus mean differential expression of these 31 genes (red points) on the background of 27,578 methylation probes (grey points). At the sample level, these 31 genes showed a negative correlation between methylation and expression (Fig. 2).
