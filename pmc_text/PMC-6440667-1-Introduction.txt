Metabolic syndrome refers to a state in which multiple diseases, such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, occur together in one individual [1]. Complications of metabolic syndrome may increase the incidence of cardiovascular diseases [2], and obstructive sleep apnea [3] or fatty liver disease [4] may also occur. It is known that the occurrence or prognosis of colorectal cancer [5], breast cancer [6], endometrial cancer [7, 8], and prostate cancer [9] is closely related to the constituents of metabolic syndrome [10]. Therefore, predicting the group at high risk for metabolic syndrome and actively preventing metabolic syndrome are essential for health care. The most common cause of metabolic syndrome has been presumed to be abdominal obesity [11]. In recent years, however, the need to consider nonobese metabolic syndrome has received attention [12]. Unlike obese metabolic syndrome, for which body weight reductions can decrease the risk and which has received much attention in health care, nonobese metabolic syndrome has no common cause, such as obesity. Without a special test, it is impossible to detect or suspect metabolic syndrome in nonobese individuals. In the nonobese metabolic syndrome population, the perception of health risks is relatively low and may be a blind spot of health care. Genetic studies of metabolic syndrome have reported a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [13â€“20] that are known to be closely related to clinical factors, such as aging [21], sex [22], abdominal obesity [11], physical activity [23], alcohol consumption [24], and smoking [25]. However, no model has been published that combines these clinical and genetic factors in a metabolic syndrome prediction model. In this study, we constructed a model to predict metabolic syndrome in nonobese people using machine learning algorithms with factors such as age, sex, environmental factors, and lifestyle habits as well as genetic predisposition factors, such as SNPs, and evaluated the performance of the model.
