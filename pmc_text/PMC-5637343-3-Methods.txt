Bone marrow samples and plasma cell sorting
Bone marrow aspirates from four MM patient samples were obtained at the diagnosis and after chemotherapy. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (NCC2016-0279) of the National Cancer Center, Korea.
Bone marrow cells were obtained and separated from heparin-treated blood through density gradient centrifugation (2,200 rpm, 20 min, break 0) using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway).
Bone marrow plasma cells were enriched using the EasySep Human Whole Blood and Bone Marrow CD138 Positive Selection kit (Stemcell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) using EasySep magnets (Stemcell Technologies) or CD138 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Gladbach, Germany) using MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. FITC-Mouse Anti-Human CD138 (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA) antibody was used to stain the cells, and the cells were applied directly to flow cytometric analysis using a FACSVerse.
