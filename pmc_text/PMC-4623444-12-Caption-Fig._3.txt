The expression variations of a regulator YY1 and its target genes. For each individuals, the expressions of the up-regulated target genes by insulin treatment were averaged and plotted on y-axis, and those of YY1 were plotted on x-axis. The expressions of YY1 do not resemble those of their target genes (correlation coefficient=-0.5878721).
