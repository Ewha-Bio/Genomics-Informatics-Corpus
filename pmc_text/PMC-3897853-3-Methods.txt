Establishment of radiation-resistant H460R cells
H460 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and irradiated with 2 Gy γ-rays using a Gammacell 3000 (Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., Chalk River, ON, Canada) at a dose rate of 3.2 Gy/min when cells approached 60% confluence. When the cells reached about 90% confluence, they were subcultured into new culture dishes. The cells were treated again with 2 Gy γ-rays at about 60% confluence. These procedures were repeated over a period of 24 months. The parental cells were cultured under the same conditions without ionizing irradiation.
