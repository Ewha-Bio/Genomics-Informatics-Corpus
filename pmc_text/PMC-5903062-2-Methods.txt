Data preparation
In this study, we used a whole-genome sequence data set consisting of 23 Hanwoo and 10 Holstein from NCBI Sequence Read Archive database (PRJNA210523, PRJNA210521, and PRJNA210519). We used fastQC software to perform a quality check on the raw sequence data [11]. Using Trimmomatic-0.32, we removed potential adapter sequences before sequence alignment [11]. Paired-end sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome (UMD 3.1.75) from the Ensemble database using Bowtie2 with default settings [12]. For downstream processing and variant-calling, we used open-source software packages: Picard tools (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), SAMtools, and Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [13, 14]. The “CreateSequenceDictionary” and “MarkDuplicates” Picard command-line tools were used to read the reference FASTA sequence to write a bam file containing a sequence dictionary, and to filter potential PCR duplicates, respectively. Using SAMtools, we created index files for the reference and bam files. We then performed local realignment of sequence reads to correct misalignments due to the presence of small insertions and deletions using the GATK “Realigner-TargetCreator” and “IndelRealigner” arguments. Additionally, base quality score recalibration was performed to get accurate quality scores and to correct the variations in quality associated with machine cycle and sequence context. For calling variants, GATK “Unified-Genotyper” and “SelectVariants” arguments were used with the following filtering criteria. All variants with (1) a Phred-scaled quality score of less than 30; (2) a read depth less than 5; (3) an MQ0 (total count across all samples of mapping quality zero reads) ＞4; or a (4) a Phred-scaled p-value using Fisher exact test of more than 200 were filtered out to reduce false-positive calls due to strand bias. We used the “vcf-merge” tools of VCFtools in order to merge all of the variant calling format files for the 33 samples [15].
The number of total SNPs was 37,484,886 and after using minor allele frequency; Holstein 0.1, Hanwoo 0.04) and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p ＜ 0.0001), the number of SNPs left in Hanwoo and Holstein were 12,626,097 and 8,636,673, respectively. The estimated transition/transversion ratio (tr/tv ratio) was calculated to be 2.24 using SnpEff [16].
