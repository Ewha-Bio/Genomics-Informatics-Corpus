In silico analysis
The functional relevance of the associated SNP sites was analyzed by overlapping the gene-coding sequence or the Encyclopedia of DNA Element (ENCODE) regulatory element positions in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Thereafter, regulomeDB (http://regulome.stanford.edu/) was utilized to extract eQTL information. In addition, Pathway Studio version 9.0 software (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD, USA) was utilized to analyze the functional interactions and possible pathways among genes/proteins in our data. It provides an interpretation of the biological implications from gene/protein expression data, the establishment of molecular pathways, and an identification of protein interaction maps and their association to cellular process [19].
