Overall pipeline of the analysis
The NGS raw data were mapped to reference sequences using an alignment tool. The significant SNPs for BMI were selected from the GWA result data. The LD blocks that encompassed the significant SNPs were searched with Haploview [10], and those NGS reads that were mapped to the LD ranges were selected with Samtools. For each LD block, the heterozygous variants from the short reads were phased with Samtools. Finally, the phased haplotypes harboring the significant SNPs were cataloged (Fig. 1).
