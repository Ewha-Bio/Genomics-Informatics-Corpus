Index of dissimilarity as a measure of association
Introduced originally as a segregation measure [8], the index of dissimilarity (IDS) has been shown to be effective in measuring genomic associations, as well [5]. A generalized version of the IDS (GIDS) has been reported to be able to yield the association strength with a phenotype having an arbitrary number of classes [5]. Fig. 1 has the schematics for the association of 2-order gene-gene interactions with a J-class phenotype. GIDS is defined as below following the notation in Fig. 1.
G I D S = 1 2 ∑ j = 1 J ∑ i n i j − E i j ∑ j = 1 J n • P • j • ( 1 − P • j )   where   n = ∑ j = 1 J n • j ,   E i j = n j • • n • j n ,   P • j = n • j n (1)
Indices i and j represent the ith multi-locus genotype and the jth multi-class phenotype, respectively. The numerator of this equation measures the extent of uneven distributions by each phenotype class, where the denominator indicates the maximum possible unevenness [8]. To visualize this concept, let us reduce GIDS to a binary—i.e., J = 2, class—as shown in Eq. (2).
G I D S J = 2 = 1 2 ∑ i n i 1 − ( n i 1 + n i 2 ) n • 1 n + ∑ i n i 2 − ( n i 1 + n i 2 ) n • 2 n n • 1 ( 1 − n • 1 n ) + n • 2 ( 1 − n • 2 n ) = 1 2 ∑ i n i 1 n • 1 − n i 2 n • 2 (2)
When there is little association between the genotype and phenotype, there would be a minimal difference between the 2 fractional terms for each i. Maximum association occurs when the differences for each i in this equation add up to the maximum.
