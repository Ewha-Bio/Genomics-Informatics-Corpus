Mapped depths and positions of the called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BRCA2. (A) Mapped depths (y-axis) of called coding SNPs in BRCA2 (x-axis) according to increasing sequencing depths. The figure at the bottom indicates the exonic regions of BRCA2. (B) Different views of panel (A) based on increasing sequencing depths. The number of called SNPs is presented in parenthesis. For example, 120× (16) indicates that 16 SNPs were successfully called in the 120× dataset.
