DNA microarray and GSEA
We performed cDNA microarray experiment using RNA extracted from the drug-treated HDFs. Among 47,319 probe sets, 20,271 probe sets passed the criteria of the detection p-value < 0.05. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis showed that drug-treated cells were well segregated in the order of DMSO, NS-398, celecoxib, and aspirin (Fig. 1).
To figure out underlying mechanisms by which COX inhibitors modulate senescence, we performed GSEA using 17,777 probe sets having all information including gene symbols and gene descriptions. We sorted the data sets based on the value of (INS-398 – IDMSO) for the comparison of NS-398 versus DMSO; the value of (ICelecoxib – IDMSO) for the comparison of celecoxib versus DMSO; and the value of (IAspirin – IDMSO) for the comparison of aspirin versus DMSO to rank the data sets as described previously [9].
We then tested (1) the Hallmark gene sets (H); (2) gene sets regulating canonical pathways—i.e., Biocarta gene sets (C2:CP:BIOCARTA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) gene sets (C2:CP:KEGG), and Reactome gene sets (C2:CP:REACTOME); and (3) gene ontology gene sets—i.e., biological process gene sets (G5:BP), cellular component gene sets (G5:CC), and molecular function gene sets (G5:MF).
