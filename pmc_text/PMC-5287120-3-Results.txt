A simulation study was performed to compare the power of the proposed method with that of AFT-MDR in the setting constructed similarly to that of Oh and Lee [8]. We consider two disease-causal SNPs among 10 unlinked diallelic loci with the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and linkage equilibrium. For the simulation study, survival time is generated from an accelerated regression model as follows: log(T) = µ + βfij + γZ + σW, where fij = P(high risk|SNP1 = i, SNP2 = j), Z~N(0,1), W~N(0,1). Here, fij is an element from the ith row and the jth column of a penetrance function, which defines a probabilistic relationship between a status of high-risk or low-risk and SNPs. We consider 14 different combinations of two different minor allele frequencies of (0.2 and 0.4) and seven different heritabilities of (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) and 70 epistatic models with 70 various penetrance functions, as described by Velez et al. [10]. We also consider four censoring fractions (0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5).
We generate 200 high-risk patients and 200 low-risk patients from each of the 70 penetrance models to create one simulated dataset, and we generate 100 datasets for each model. We set µ = 0.0, β = −1.0, γ = 1.0, σ = 1.0. First, we check whether or not a type-I error is well preserved under the null hypothesis. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, there are two kinds of type-I errors: uncorrected and corrected. The uncorrected type-I error is obtained from the asymptotic central chi-square distribution, whereas the corrected type-I error is calculated from the non-central chi-square distribution. For the non-centrality parameter, 5 or 10 permutations are performed when the censoring fraction is less than 0.3, but 30 permutations are needed to estimate the non-centrality under censoring heavier than 0.3. The results of Table 1 show that the type-I error is well controlled over all combinations of minor allele frequencies and censoring fractions. Fig. 1 displays the result of Table 1.
For the comparison of power, we define two powers, PBonf and PRank. PBonf is the proportion of p-values less than the nominal sizes after adjusting for multiple testing among 100 cases. However, the power of AFT-MDR is defined as the percentage of times that it correctly chooses the disease-causal model out of each set of 100 datasets. Thus, we comparably define the power of the proposed method as PRank, which is estimated as the percentage of times that the causal model has the smallest p-value out of all possible multi-locus models. We compared these three powers in the simulation study. In addition, we simulated two different scenarios according to the main effect.
In the first scenario, we consider the model without any main effect of SNPs; Fig. 2 and Table 2 display the power of the PBonf, PRank, and AFT-MDR methods over various combinations of two different minor allele frequencies, seven different heritabilities, and four different censoring fractions. As indicated in Fig. 2, PRank is greater than PBonf and the power of AFT-MDR for all cases, whereas the power of AFT-MDR is less than PBonf, although the difference is smaller, as the censoring fraction is larger than 0.5. The trend of these three powers is similar, in the sense that they increase as the heritability increases, whereas they decrease as the censoring fraction increases. In addition, it is shown that the power is relatively larger when the minor allele frequency (MAF) is 0.2 than when the MAF is 0.4. When the heritability is smaller than 0.1, the power is not larger than 0.3, but PRank rapidly increases as the heritability is greater than 0.1, but both PBonf and the power of AFT-MDR slowly increase.
On the other hand, in the second scenario, we generated the survival time by considering the main effect of SNP3 as follows: log(T) = µ + βfij + γZ + αSNP3 + σW.
After classifying the high-risk and low-risk groups by the standardized residual, as done in AFT-MDR, the indicator variable for the high-risk group, S, is defined, and the significance of the gene-gene interactions between SNP1 and SNP2 is tested under the following model: log(T) = µ + β1SNP1 + β2SNP2 + δS + γZ + σW.
From the simulation results, the power of PBonf, PRank, and AFT-MDR is similarly obtained and displayed in Fig. 3 and Table 3.
As shown in Fig. 3, the power of AFT-MDR is almost 0 for all cases, whereas PRank shows a similar trend, as shown in Fig. 2, when the main effect is not considered. However, the size of PBonf is also smaller, as shown in Fig. 2, and has almost no power when the MAF is 0.4 and censoring fraction is larger than 0.1. The effect of the censoring fraction is much larger on these three powers when the main effect is considered. Comparing PRank with the power of AFT-MDR, AFT-MDR hardly detects any interaction effect when the main effect of SNPs is considered in the model. However, PRank has slightly moderate power when MAF is 0.2 and the censoring fraction is smaller than 0.5.
