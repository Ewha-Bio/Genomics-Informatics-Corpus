Peak calling (step 6)
For ChIP-Seq peak calling, we chose the ‘mosaics’ package, which uses an adaptive and robust statistical approach; ‘mosaics’ is an acronym of “Model-Based One- and Two-sample Analysis and Inference for ChIP-Seq data.” It implements a flexible parametric mixture modeling approach for detecting peaks—e.g., enriched regions—in one-sample (ChIP sample) or two-sample (ChIP and matched control samples) ChIP-Seq data. It can account for mappability and GC content biases that arise in ChIP-Seq data [10]. Recently, ‘mosaics’ extended the framework with a hidden Markov Model (HMM) architecture, named mosaics-HMM [14], to identify broad peaks; so, mosaics is useful for the analysis of both sharp and broad peaks. As for broad peaks, mosaics has two methods: ‘mosaicsFitHMM’ and ‘mosaicsPeakHMM.’ For computational efficiency, ‘mosaicsFitHMM’ utilizes MOSAiCS model fit as estimates of emission distribution of the MOSAiCS-HMM model. In addition, it also considers MOSAiCS peak calling results at a specified false discovery rate (FDR) level as initial values by default. For more information, please peruse the vignette on 'mosaics' in Bioconductor. Here, we describe an example of a sharp peak calling process.
