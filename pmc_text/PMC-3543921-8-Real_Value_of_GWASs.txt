Currently, most people look at GWASs as a method to identify a marker for genetic diagnosis and risk assessment. Yes, by knowing the genetic risk, we can re-evaluate and modify our lifestyle and prevent unhappy problems, like side effects of drugs. However, GWASs could give us far sweeter fruit. Through functional analysis of a gene and its associated variants, we can approach the mechanism of the disease. By studying the meaning of allelic differences of causal variants, we can clarify the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. With the knowledge of the pathogenesis, we can walk directly to develop innovative treatments and discover new drugs (Fig. 3). Therefore, identification of the significantly associated SNP is just 'end of the beginning' to get to the final goal: treatment of patients with common diseases. However, at present, after identification of 'marker' SNPs by GWASs, we have no golden road to find 'causal' SNPs (variants). We have no customized method to identify functional variants. There is still a long and winding road before us. It's just the beginning.
