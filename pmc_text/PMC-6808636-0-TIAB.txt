Analysis of differences in human leukocyte antigen between the two Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium control datasets
The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) study was a large genome-wide association study that aimed to identify common variants associated with seven diseases. That study combined two control datasets (58C and UK Blood Services) as shared controls. Prior to using the combined controls, the WTCCC performed analyses to show that the genomic content of the control datasets was not significantly different. Recently, the analysis of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes has become prevalent due to the development of HLA imputation technology. In this project, we extended the between-control homogeneity analysis of the WTCCC to HLA. We imputed HLA information in the WTCCC control dataset and showed that the HLA content was not significantly different between the two control datasets, suggesting that the combined controls can be used as controls for HLA fine-mapping analysis based on HLA imputation.
