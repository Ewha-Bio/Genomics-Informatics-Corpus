Natural language processing (NLP) text mining strategies are a recognized means to approach the increasingly urgent need for usable and effective text mining facilities for scientific publications. Numerous platforms and frameworks that support text mining activity have been developed, including the General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE [1]), CLARIN WebLicht [2], the Language Applications (LAPPS) Grid [3], OpenMinTeD [4], and several systems based on the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA [5]), e.g., ARGO [6], Apache cTAKES [7], DKPro Core [8]. However, in many cases the full suite of tools and resources required for a given task is not available within any single platform. Attempting to access different functionalities by combining tools and services from different platforms inevitably leads to roadblocks due to a lack of “interoperability” among them, which can demand substantial computational expertise to overcome.
In this paper, we investigate cross-platform interoperability, with an eye toward identifying the design elements of annotation models and processes that are particularly problematic for, or amenable to, enabling seamless communication among different platforms providing different functionalities. As a case study, we focus on a specific methodology, namely machine-assisted interactive annotation (also known as human-in-the-loop annotation), which requires the ability to freely combine resources from different document repositories, access to a wide array of NLP tools to automatically annotate corpora for various linguistic phenomena, and a sophisticated annotation editor that enables interactive manual annotation coupled with on-the-fly machine learning. We consider three independently-developed platforms, which together provide the required functionalities: a document repository, an NLP service provider, and an interactive annotation tool. Our goal is to shed light on the issues that arise when attempting to make these platforms pairwise interoperable, and determine the extent to which pairwise interoperability entails interoperability across a proxy, e.g., if the text annotation editor and the NLP services are automatically interoperable when communicating via the document repository. Our analysis is the result of a collaboration at the 5th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH 5, http://blah5.linkedannotation.org) and takes into account both implemented modifications to the three platforms and proposed changes that are not fully implemented at the time of this writing.
