Comparative analysis
The only part of the Neanderthal genome that was sequenced completely from multiple specimens until recently was the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The major analysis that was made with the mtDNA sequence was to seek an answer to the question of interbreeding. The Neanderthal mtDNA sequence consistently falls outside the spectrum of variations observed in the modern human mtDNA sequence, indicating no interbreeding between the species [24-26, 45, 46]. Previously, besides detecting specific mutations in MCPH1 and FOXP2, the candidate gene approach also detected the presence of fragments of the MC1R gene that may indicate the red hair and pale skin of Neanderthals [47], segments of the ABO blood group locus [48], and a taste receptor gene [49]. Despite many critical technical challenges in sequencing ancient genomes ([26]; reviewed in [50]), the whole genome of Neanderthals has been sequenced recently by Green et al. [27], and it allowed this research group to perform a genome-wide sequence comparison with the modern human genome sequence, and the significant results from the initial analyses are discussed briefly below.
