The aim of this study was to evaluate and develop a computerized system that is fused with bioinformatics. Specifically, we focused on implementing an environment that extends the capabilities of the ICTV web system and connects to PubMed in order to enhance searches performed by academic groups. We extended and rebuilt the database and extracted meaningful data using a pipeline that parses XML, text, and web contents. Henceforth, this computerized system will be continually extended and used as a web tool that can detect new viral types and classify them rapidly and accurately. Recently, a new virus classification system based on metagenomics has been proposed. Thus, web-based virus taxonomy could augment the quality by adding virus classification, which is derived by viral metagenomics analysis [8]. We suggest that the web system, analytical pipelines, and extended database we describe herein could be used to add these metagenomics data to ICTV taxonomy data.
