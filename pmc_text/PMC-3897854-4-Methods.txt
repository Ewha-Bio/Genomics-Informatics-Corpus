Statistical analysis
Haploview software (version 3.2) was used to design MRP2 haplotype constructs and analyze major or minor haplotypes based on a standard expectation-maximization algorithm. Allele and genotype frequencies of transporter polymorphisms were assessed using chi-square tests (version 11.5 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
