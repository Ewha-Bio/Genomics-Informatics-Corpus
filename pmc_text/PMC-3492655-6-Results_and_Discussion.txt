The general characteristics of the CNV calls from the 3 algorithms are shown in Table 2. The total number of CNV calls from the 3 algorithms was similar-range 814 to 1,362. The median size of the CNVs called by PennCNV (12.9 kb) were bigger than the other 2 algorithms (7.5 kb and 7.9 kb). The size of the CNVs consistently detected by 2 or more algorithms was generally bigger than that of the CNVs detected by a single method. For example, the average sizes of the CNVs that were detected from all 3 algorithms, 2 algorithms, and 1 method were 107 kb, 73.2 kb, and 15.9 kb, respectively (Table 3). Fig. 1 shows the examples of different sizes of CNVs according to the LRR distribution of gain- and loss-type CNV regions, depending on how many algorithms detected the CNV in that region. These data suggest that larger-sized CNVs are generally more prominent; so, they can be relatively easily detected by any segmentation method, regardless of the algorithm. But, detection of the smaller-sized CNVs can be affected more easily by the characteristics of the CNV defining algorithm; so, they can be detected by 1 particular algorithm.
A recent report examining the impact of inaccuracy of CNV detection from SNP genotyping data revealed that CNVs, defined as the copy number changes of >7 consecutive probes, were fairly reliable in case of deletion type CNVs [29]. In our previous study exploring the CNV profiles of Koreans using an Affymetrix array, we suggested the filtering condition of CNV call as >6 consecutive probes to be reliable [5]. Therefore, to make more reliable conditions in this study, we filtered the CNV calls as >7 consecutive probes. Under this criterion, the number of CNV calls from the 3 algorithms was reduced down from 295 to 385, while the median size became bigger-50 kb by PennCNV and QuantiSNP and 23.5 kb by BirdSuite (Table 2). In this condition, same as above, the size of the CNVs consistently detected by 2 or more algorithms was generally bigger than that of the CNVs detected by a single method (Table 3).
In terms of the number of CNVs consistently identified by different algorithms, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV algorithm, 48.6% (396/814 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms, and only 4.9% (40/814 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms. Similarly, of the CNV calls using QuantiSNP, 42.9% (466/1,087 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and only 3.9% (42/1,087 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms. However, in the case of the BirdSuite algorithm, although the number of CNV calls was the biggest, only 9.6% (131/1,362 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and 2.9% (40/1,362 CNVs) was detected by all 3 algorithms. Taken together, only 17% of the total CNV calls (465/2,735 CNVs) were defined by more than 2 algorithms, and only 1.5% (40/2,735 CNVs) was defined by all 3 algorithms (Table 3). In the filtering condition of >7 consecutive probes, the number of CNVs consistently identified by different algorithms was improved. For example, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV algorithm, 76.6% (226/295 CNVs) was detected by 2 or more algorithms and only 23.4% (69/295 CNVs) was detected uniquely by PennCNV. QuantiSNP calls showed a similar trend. However, even under this condition, 92.5% (356/385 CNVs) of BirdSuite calls were unique (Table 3). All the CNVs consistently detected by 2 algorithms were from PennCNV and QuantiSNP, while no CNVs that were detected by the BirdSuite algorithm were consistently detected by 2 algorithms, with only 1 exception. These data suggest that CNV calls from SNP genotyping depend substantially on the characteristics of calling algorithms, and only part of the CNV calls from each algorithm seems to be reliable. Therefore, CNVs identified from SNP genotyping data must be validated as completely as possible, and especially in the case of using a single calling algorithm, the CNVs must be validated more carefully. Filtering the CNV calls by the number of consecutive probes can improve the reliability of CNV calls.
To validate the CNVs identified from 3 different algorithms in this study, we randomly selected 25 CNV regions across the whole chromosomes. The genomic qPCR validation results are listed in Table 4. In case of the CNVs identified by all 3 algorithms, 71.4% (5/7) of the consistency was observed between the CNV call and genomic qPCR result. Of the CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms, 57.6% (19/33) was consistent. Of the unique CNV calls defined by just a single algorithm, only 38.3% (18/47) was consistent, but the other 61.7% (28/46) was not consistent. In the case of the CNVs defined as >7 consecutive probes, the consistency was generally improved-47.8% (unique CNVs), 62.2% (CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms), and 83.3% (CNVs identified by all 3 algorithms). These results indicate that CNV calls from 2 or more algorithms are more reliable than those from single algorithms. CNV calls from all 3 algorithms are, of course, the most reliable, but this is too stringent; so, the number of CNVs is not applicable for GWAS analysis.
In this study, we aimed to verify the effect of adopting multiple CNV calling algorithms and set up the most reliable pipeline for CNV calling with Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 data. We found that CNVs defined by a single CNV calling algorithm may not reliable enough for further GWAS study, regardless of the types of algorithms. Based on our findings, we propose that for reliable CNV-based GWAS using SNP array data, CNV calls must be performed with at least 3 different algorithms, and the CNVs consistently called from more than 2 methods must be used for association analysis.
