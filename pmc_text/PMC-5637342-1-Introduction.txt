Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region is an important genetic factor for a wide range of human diseases, such as type 1 diabetes [1] and rheumatoid arthritis [2, 3]. In association studies of HLA, it is essential to investigate the high-resolution genotypes of HLA genes. However, genotyping HLA alleles in a large number of samples can be prohibitively expensive due to the high HLA typing cost. To overcome this challenge, imputation approaches have been recently developed to impute HLA alleles from intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data [4-6]. These approaches, of which SNP2HLA [4] is widely used, can impute high-resolution HLA alleles efficiently and have been utilized in a number of large-scale fine-mapping HLA analyses of diseases [1-3, 7, 8].
Although the use of imputation approaches has become prevalent, imputation errors can always be present. To reduce imputation errors, it is often necessary to use a large reference panel that can capture diverse HLA alleles. Both the size of the panel and the diversity of alleles can increase if we can use multiple reference panels at the same time. However, in current HLA imputation frameworks, there is no streamlined pipeline for simultaneously utilizing multiple reference panels.
In this study, we present a software package, MergeReference, that merges multiple reference panels in SNP2HLA [4] format into a single panel for HLA imputation. By merging multiple reference panels of similar ethnicities, we can increase both the sample size and the allele diversity of the panel and therefore improve the imputation accuracy. We compared the performance of the Pan-Asian reference panel [9], the Korean reference panel [10], and the merged reference panel generated by our software by masking and imputing the HLA alleles in the HapMap [11] Asian dataset. The merged panel achieved an average 4-digit accuracy of six HLA genes of 93.9%, whereas the Pan-Asian and the Korean panels had 86.6% and 91.5% accuracy rates, respectively, demonstrating that the simultaneous use of multiple reference panels improves the accuracy.
