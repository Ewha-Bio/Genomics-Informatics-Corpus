Hypertension is defined as blood pressure measurement consistently higher than 140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [1]. It is a complex syndrome determined by genetic and environmental factors and affected by multiple genetic factors to 30% to 50% of blood pressure variability in human hypertension [2]. Although hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, the exact cause of hypertension is unclear [3].
Oxidative stress, which results in an excessive product of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is one of the fundamental mechanisms of the development of hypertension. In the vascular system, ROS has physical and pathophysiological roles that are important in vascular remodeling and endothelial dysfunction associated with hypertension [4]. Since 1960, when the association between free radicals and hypertension was reported [5], plenty of data supporting a role of oxidative stress in hypertension have been published. However, the evidence of whether oxidative stress causes hypertension is weak, and a few clinical studies have shown the relationship between blood pressure and ROS. Nonetheless, oxidative stress has an important role in vascular biology and a potential role in hypertension.
In this study, ROS-hypertension-related genes were collected by the biological literature-mining tools, such as SciMiner and gene2pubmed, in order to identify the genes that would cause hypertension through ROS. Further, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within these gene regions were examined statistically for their association with hypertension in 6,419 Korean individuals, and pathway enrichment analysis using the associated genes was performed.
