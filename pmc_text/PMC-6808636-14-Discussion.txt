In the present study, we compared the two control cohorts of the WTCCC dataset (UKBS and 58C). We focused on between-cohort differences in the HLA genes, which belong to the polymorphic region of chromosome 6. In both the association analysis of the genome-wide SNPs and the association analysis of the imputed HLA markers, no alleles showed a significant difference in allele frequency between the cohorts. Furthermore, in the K-S test, the two cohorts did not show statistically significant differences in any HLA gene. These results suggest that the two control cohorts are genetically homogeneous in HLA, and that the combined controls of the WTCCC can be used as supplementary controls for HLA fine-mapping studies as well, as for GWAS. However, we note that researchers must evaluate homogeneity between their own control cohort and the combined WTCCC controls if they are to use the WTCCC data as additional controls, because we only evaluated the homogeneity between the two WTCCC control datasets themselves.
