Bioinformatic analyses of target genes
The interaction of target gene and its related genes was analyzed gene-gene interaction (GGI) by using Gene MANIA database (http://genemania.org/). In addition, to identify target protein, associated other proteins, STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) ver. 10.5 program for functional protein association network (https://string-db.org/) was used and commonly referred as protein-protein interaction (PPI). STRING database informed a degree of target and related protein similarity, as well as co-occurrence analysis among various species.
