Statistical testing
TRAPR has several statistical testing functions to identify DEGs. Student t-test and statistical methods suggested in edgeR, baySeq, and DESeq assume a normal distribution or a Poisson distribution. Meanwhile, methods in DEGseq and NOISeq [12] do not need to make any assumption. For now, there is no correct answer that fits the characteristics of RNA-Seq data, and each method has its own merits. TRAPR allows users to choose their own methods to build customized analysis pipelines. The t test is recommended for large datasets, whereas edgeR and simple-fold change work for datasets with a small number of samples. DEGs can be labeled and saved as files containing lists of gene names with detailed information.
