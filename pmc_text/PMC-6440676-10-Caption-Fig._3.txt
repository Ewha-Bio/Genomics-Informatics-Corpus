Expression levels of PVT1 in non-small cell lung cancers. Datasets obtained from Oncomine demonstrated that lung adenocarcinomas significantly expressed high levels of PVT1 compared to the normal counterparts. (A) Fold change = 2.232, p = 6.13 × 10−8 [26]. (B) Fold change = 4.293, p = 1.45 × 10−5 [27]. PVT1, plasmacytoma variant translocation 1.
