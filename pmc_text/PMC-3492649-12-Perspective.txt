Recent advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies have facilitated genomewide investigation of human genetic variations and provided new insights into population structure and admixture history. Admixed populations are attracting more and more attention from both evolutionary and medical studies as well as from the other fields. Without understanding the genetic structure and history of admixed populations well, our knowledge about human genetics would not be complete. Unfortunately, studies on admixed populations in Asia are so far very limited, although gene flow among Asian populations is prevalent [68]. The studies published and mentioned in this review have been focused on investigating the genetic structure and genetic history of a limited number of well-known admixed populations in Asia. Further efforts should be made to reveal local adaptation signatures and also apply admixture mapping in those well-known admixed populations; in the future, more powerful methods are expected to be developed and applied to many more populations with longer histories and more complex admixture scenarios.
