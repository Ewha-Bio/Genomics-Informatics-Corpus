miRNA quantification in plasma
The miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155 expression levels were measured by using the TaqMan qRT-PCR analysis system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA). The expression level of each miRNA was normalized to U6snRNA. In brief, this assay entailed a 2-step qRT-PCR of miRNA of 19-25 nucleotides, priming with a stem-loop primer onto a longer cDNA that is amenable to amplification, and quantification by a TaqMan-based real-time PCR. Ct was the number of cycles at which the fluorescence signal passed the appropriate threshold. Expression levels were determined by using the delta Ct (Î”Ct) method, where Ct represents the number of cycles in which the fluorescence signal passed the appropriate threshold.
