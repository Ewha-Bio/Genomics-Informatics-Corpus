Protein quantitation
Several LC-MS/MS approaches provide quantitative information of the peptides identified from the database search (protein quantification) (Fig. 1). First, prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides can be labeled using the isotopic agents, such as isotope-coded affinity tag (iCAT) [28], isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) [29], or tandem mass tags (TMT) [30]. For the iCAT data, the abundance of an identified peptide is estimated as the area under the elusion curve of the peptide. On the other hand, for the iTRAQ or TMT data, the peptide abundance is estimated as the intensities of the reporter ions in the MS/MS data [31]. Second, when no isotope labeling was done, called label-free LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptide abundance is estimated as the area under the elusion curve of the peptide as done for the iCAT data. Next, the relative abundance of an identified peptide is calculated as the ratio of the peptide abundances between patient and control samples. From the iCAT data, the ratios of the heavy and light peptides are calculated as the relative peptide abundance. To estimate the relative abundances of a protein, a list of the peptides derived from the proteins are identified and the relative abundances of these peptides are then combined using a method for protein quantitation, such as the quantification tool in MaxQuant software [32] or a linear programming method [33].
