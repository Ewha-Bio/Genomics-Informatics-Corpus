Recently, based on the advances in NGS technologies, various quantification and analysis methods have been developed for the transcriptome studies. In addition, with the accumulation of RNA-Seq data sets in the public databases, there is a demand for integrative analysis; therefore, it has become an active research field. However, the available RNA-Seq data are stored in different formats such as read count, TPM, and FPKM. This hinders the integrative analysis of the RNA-Seq data. To solve this problem, we have developed a web-based application using Shiny, COEX-seq that easily converts data in a variety of measurement formats of gene expression used in most bioinformatic tools for RNA-Seq. Thus, COEX-seq is very useful to use with other analysis tools developed using R.
