KARE data
We used 352,228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped using Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP Array 5.0 (genomic coordinates hg18; Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 8,842 Korean individuals from the KARE project. We converted hg18 to hg19 using the liftOver tool from UCSC (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver) and converted Affymetrix ID to dbSNP reference cluster ID using the annotation file offered by Affymetrix (http://affymetrix.com). In this study, we focused on DM, HT, and CAD (myocardial infarction and CAD) and considered people who did not have any disease as the controls (Table 1).
