Mutation rate by position within 20-mer barcodes
To estimate the mutation rate by position within 20-mer barcodes, 1,284 mutations from 7,734 Sanger-sequenced barcodes were analyzed. As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 2, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%). Intriguingly, the mutation frequency showed an increasing tendency from position 20 to position 1 in a similar manner as budding yeast [9]. The phenomenon is consistent with a decrease in the fidelity of the solid-phase chemical synthesis with distance from the first position at the 3â€™-end of each oligonucleotide.
