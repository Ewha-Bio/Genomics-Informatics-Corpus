Clinical characteristics
BP was measured 3 times in the supine position. Before the first measurement, participants rested for 5 minutes, and the 3 measurements were taken in one arm showing the higher BP at least 3 minutes apart. After the supine position measurement, the BP was measured soon after standing. Two of 8,842 subjects did not undergo BP measurement in the standing posture. Also, 1,291 individuals who had been treated with anti-hypertensive drug therapy and 1,114 self-reported diabetic patients or diagnosed diabetic patients by KoGES were excluded. Ultimately, 3,255 individuals from Ansan and 3,173 individuals from Ansung were used for the GWASs. Other cardiovascular risk factors, such as cholesterol level and fasting glucose level, were measured from blood samples after overnight fasting.
