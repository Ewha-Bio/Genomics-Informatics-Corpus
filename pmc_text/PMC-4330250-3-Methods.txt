Genotyping, imputation, and GWA analysis
The Korean samples and genotype data used in this study have been described by Cho et al. [11]. Briefly, through the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, a total of 10,038 participants were recruited from Ansan and Anseong population-based cohorts, aged 40 to 69. The genotypes that had been measured on Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were filtered for quality control, resulting in 8,842 samples and 352,228 markers. The genotype data were expanded to a total of 1,827,004 SNPs through imputation with IMPUTE [12] using the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)/Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) component of HapMap as the reference.
BMI traits were tested for association by linear regression analysis with an additive model after adjustments for recruitment region, age, and sex as covariates using PLINK. The threshold of genome-wide significance was set at p < 5 Ã— 10-4. The significant SNPs were clustered into LD blocks (r2 > 0.9) using HaploView [13].
