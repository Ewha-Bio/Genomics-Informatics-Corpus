Viruses are the most abundant and diverse biological entities in the biosphere, and their global numbers have been estimated at 1.2 × 1030 and 2.6 × 1030 in the ocean and soil, respectively [1]. Thus, viruses are key elements that contribute to the life cycles of cellular organisms [2]. However, the study of viral ecology in natural habitats has been limited due to the difficulties of viral culture [3]. The lack of a ubiquitous marker gene, such as the 16S rRNA gene shared by all bacteria and archaea, also hampered our understanding of the genetic diversity of viruses, prior to the introduction of metagenomics into the field of viral ecology [1, 4]. Recently, viral metagenomics has enabled researchers to explore the community structure and diversity of viruses in various natural ecosystems [5]. This methodology depends on a priori knowledge of the viral types that may be present [6, 7].
The first viral metagenome of uncultured marine viral communities was published in 2002 [8], and there have been many subsequent advances in the methodologies (e.g., methods for amplifying the initial viral genomes) and tools used for bioinformatics analysis in viral metagenomics. These technical developments have facilitated explorations of the abundance and diversity of viruses from a wide range of natural habitats in Korea. In Korea, viral metagenomics was applied for the first time to unique samples, including fermented foods and atmospheric samples, as well as habitats where viruses are expected to have significant roles, such as rice paddy soil, seawater, and the human gut. This review describes recent advances in viral metagenomics and provides summaries of studies that have been conducted to characterize Korean viral metagenomes. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the most widely used viral DNA amplification methods are discussed, based on empirical knowledge. Further directions for the study of virus-host interactions are also highlighted.
