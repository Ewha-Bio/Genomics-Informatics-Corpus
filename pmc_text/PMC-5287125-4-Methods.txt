Statistical analyses
Associations between clinicopathological factors, including age, IPI, performance status by WHO, cancer stage, and extra-nodal involvement, and patients' survival were analyzed using univariable or multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models.
All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, with p-values greater than 0.05 using HWE.test in R package {genetics} [10].
Three different genetic models—additive, dominant, and recessive—were used to assess each SNP's effect on the hazard ratios (HRs) for survival. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the day of diagnosis to the day of last follow-up or death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was measured from the day of diagnosis to the day of progression or death. Patients who were alive at the time of follow-up were censored. The effects of SNPs on OS or PFS were presented as HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The total patient dataset was used for the analysis. The same analysis was repeated using the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated by R-CHOP. All reported p-values are two-sided, and statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
