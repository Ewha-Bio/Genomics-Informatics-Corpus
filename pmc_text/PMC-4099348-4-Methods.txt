Target enrichment
Eight different restriction reactions were used to digest genomic DNAs from each sample, including SfcI and Hpy188I in NEB buffer 4; DdeI and AluI in NEB buffer 2; MseI and Bsu36I in NEB buffer 3; MslI and BfaI in NEB buffer 4; HpyCH4III and Bsp1286 in NEB buffer 4; SfcI and NlaIII in NEB buffer 4; MseI and HpyCH4III in NEB buffer 4; and HpyCH4V and EcoO109I in NEB buffer 4 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The restriction reactions contained 1 unit each of two restriction enzymes and their corresponding compatible NEB buffer in 1× concentration and 0.85 µg/µL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a total volume of 10 µL. The reactions were incubated at 37℃ for 60 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 80℃ for 20 min.
A total of 80 µL of pooled digested sample was mixed with 10 pM biotinylated selector probes, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 in a total volume of 160 µL. The mixture was incubated and hybridized at 95℃ for 10 min, 75℃ for 30 min, 68℃ for 30 min, 55℃ for 30 min, and 46℃ for 10 h. The hybridized solution was mixed with 10 µL M-280 streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (3.35 × 107 beads/mL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 in a final volume of 200 µL and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After incubation, the beads were collected using a ring magnet and washed in 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 in a total volume of 200 µL at 46℃ for 30 min with rotation.
