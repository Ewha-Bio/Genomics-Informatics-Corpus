Library preparation and massive parallel sequencing
Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 5 µg of gDNA in 200 µL nuclease-free water was fragmented by a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) at high power for 30 min (30 s ON and 30 s OFF). Overhangs of fragmented gDNA were converted to blunt ends using T4 DNA ligase and Klenow enzyme. Subsequently, an 'A' base was added to the ends of double-stranded DNA using Klenow exo- (3' to 5' exo minus). The paired-end adaptor (Illumina) with a single 'T' base overhang at the 3' end was ligated to the products above. The PE adaptor-ligated products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and excised from the gel from approximately 400 bp to 500 bp. The sequencing libraries were bar-coded to allow sequencing of 6 samples in one lane of a flow cell. Size-selected DNA fragments were enriched by PCR with PE primers 1.1 and 2.1 (Illumina). The concentration of the libraries was measured on both a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Qubit IT (Invitrogen). Finally, the libraries were validated by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The gDNA library was sequenced using the Illumina genome analyzer GAIIx according to the manufacturer's instructions.
