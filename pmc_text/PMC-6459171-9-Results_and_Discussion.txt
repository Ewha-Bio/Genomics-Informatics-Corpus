Regulation of cell growth
Lung type II cells can undergo cell proliferation and differentiate into type I cells [11]. Several growth-associated genes regulate cell proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis in the lung. These include KGF, hepatoma derived growth factor (Hdgf), heparin binding epidermal growth factor (Hb-egf), and amphiregulin (Areg). Previous studies have shown that keratinocyte and hepatocyte growth factors play an important role in lung development, inflammation and repair [53]. Klf5 is part of the pluripotent stem cell gene signature along with Oct4, Sox2 and, Myc that is required for perinatal lung morphogenesis and function [44]. AP1, NF-kB, ATF family members have been shown to participate in a variety of growth factor, stress response and cell death pathways [36,37]. Elf3 is a member of Ets family of transcription factors and is highly expressed in epithelial tissues. High level of Elf3 expression in mouse embryogenesis and 30% fetal lethality in homozygous knockout mice suggest important role in early development [57]. Furthermore, Elf3 regulates non-small cell lung carcinoma by modulating oncogenic signal transduction pathways [58].
Global gene expression profiling studies revealed that transcription factors regulate the functional organization of the transcriptome in mouse lung type II cells and the list provides an important resource. Taken together, transcription factor profiling in signal transduction pathways involved in lung injury as well as development expand our view of the transcription factor landscape in the regulatory genome architecture of mouse lung type II cells. A comprehensive transcriptome resource of many cell types in humans and mice called Cell Atlas is being developed [29,59]. This approach may be used for constructing novel signal transduction pathways from transcription factor profiles in developmental and ligand inducible gene expression microarray datasets. Further studies may provide a framework for generating novel mouse models for human lung diseases and potential therapeutic targets.
