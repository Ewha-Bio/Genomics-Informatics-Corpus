Profile search of msDNA
A multiple-sequence alignment of the eight prototype msDNA sequences was generated with ClustalW (Fig. 2). We then built a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile from the multiple-sequence alignment using the software tool HmmerBuild in the HMMER package [7]. The potential retron sequences were screened using HmmerSearch with the HMM profile [7]. The cutoff for a specific hit was determined by leave-one-out crossvalidation as follows: (1) among the eight seed sequences, one was set aside, and the remaining seven were used to build the profile; (2) what was set aside was then evaluated using the profile; (3) this process was repeated for each of the eight seeds, and the minimum score was defined as the cutoff (45.0).
