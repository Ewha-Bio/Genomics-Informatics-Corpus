Protein function prediction
With the results of sequencing genomes, the efforts to predict protein functions have been focused on the functionalities of genomic annotations. In the initial stage, the prediction of protein function begins with the sequence homologies to annotated proteins [54-57]. These methods have been successful, but 70% of proteins still remain unannotated [58]. Accordingly, various types of methods have been developed to characterize unannotated proteins. In this review, we introduce four approaches in protein function prediction, based on direct interactions in the network: neighborhood-based, graph-based, Bayesian, and Kernel-based approaches. The methods are summarized in Table 3 [10, 11, 13-16, 59-83].
In neighborhood-based approach, the proposed methods [1, 62, 63, 65] commonly consider the number of edges connected to annotated proteins in a neighborhood. The neighborhood counting method [1] only takes into account the frequencies of annotated proteins in the neighborhood and chooses the top three functions, with the calculated frequencies ranked in descending order for each protein. Other methods also have derived their own scores, such as Ï‡2 statistics [62] and functional similarities [63, 65], based on the annotated protein information in the neighborhood. These methods choose a function with the highest score as a predicted function for each protein.
The graph-based approach is similar to the neighborhood-based approach, but the graph-based approach focuses more on how to label the unannotated proteins with graph theoretical properties, such as the distance and the adjacency matrix. The label assignment models have been proposed with the adjacency matrix [66] and the weighted adjacency matrix [67], respectively. Since these assignment problems are computationally intractable, the heuristic methods, such as the simple threshold rule or simulated annealing [84], have been applied. To avoid these computational problems, several propagation-flavored methods have been developed. First, the label propagation methods [69, 70] obtain the optimal assignments and the optimal combination of the weight matrices that reflects different types of networks. Second, the functional flow method [68] iteratively spreads the flow from the annotated protein to the unannotated proteins by connected edges. The functional flow score, defined as an amount of the flow, is the criterion of the prediction. Third, the sequential linear neighborhood propagation method [71] sequentially updates unlabeled proteins according to their shortest path distance to the set of labeled proteins. Finally, the neighbor relativity coefficient (NRC) method [72] derives the NRC score by integrating various graph topological properties, such as the shortest path distance, path connectivity, and common neighbors.
The Bayesian approach takes into account the posterior probabilities of binary label random variables to obtain the prediction from the observed network and annotated proteins. Markov random field (MRF)-based [85] methods [74, 75] have been proposed and modified to Bayesian MRF [77] recently. To predict protein functions, these methods commonly derive the marginal posterior probability of the binary label variable given other variables and then estimate the posterior probability by Gibbs sampling. In addition to MRF-based models, other probabilistic models [78-80] have been developed under hierarchical structures from gene ontology [64]-which provides gene product annotation data that are characterized into three categories: biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions-with some models, such as the hierarchical binomial neighborhood model [79]. In particular, Jiang et al. [80] considered the auto-probit model with a weighted network information from STRING [16], and their auto-probit model also reflects the uncertainty of the annotation [64].
The Kernel-based approach considers the protein function prediction problem as a classification problem. To reflect network information into the classification state, the network information is converted into a kernel matrix. Lanckriet et al. [81] proposed the kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) method, which incorporates heterogeneous types of data, such as amino acid sequence, gene expression data, and PPI network data, by converting these data into kernel matrices. The SVM method can be reformulated as semi-definite programming (SDP) [86] with kernels. Although the SVM method performs well, this method becomes slow when the dimension increases, caused by the computational complexity of the SDP. To remedy this problem, Lee et al. [82] proposed the kernel-based logistic regression (KLR) method by combing MRF-based methods [74, 75] with the diffusion kernel [87]. The KLR can contain multiple functions and various types of datasets at once. It has been shown that the KLR method is faster than the SVM and is comparable to the SVM in prediction accuracy [82]. Recently, Wang et al. [83] proposed the function-function correlated multi-label method, which treats all function categories in the prediction at once, while other methods only consider one function at a time, except for KLR.
