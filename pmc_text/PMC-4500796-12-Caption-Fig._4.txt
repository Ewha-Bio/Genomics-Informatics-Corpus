Mean mapped depth and coverage of diagnostic genomic regions according to sequencing depth. Lines indicate the coverage proportion of the genomic regions of 196 diagnostic genes with specific minimum depths, according to the sequencing depths. Red line: genomic coverage >25Ã—. Bars indicate mean mapped depths (mean depth).
