Genotyping
The genotyping and quality control procedures for the KARE data have been described previously [10]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a high missing gene call rate (>5%), low minor allele frequency (<0.05), and significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p â‰¤ 0.001) were excluded, leaving a total of 311,493 SNPs to be examined.
