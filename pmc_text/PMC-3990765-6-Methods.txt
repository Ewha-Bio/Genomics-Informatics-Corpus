Functional analysis of ESNP and ECNP markers
To investigate the characteristics of the ECNP- and ESNP-related genes, we selected the ECNP and ESNP markers ranked in the top 1% of the ethnically specific variations. We mapped ESNP and ECNP markers to gene structure, based on Entrez gene-centered information at NCBI [16]. We identified the relationships among ESNP- and ECNP-genes using the Ingenuity Systems Pathway Analysis tool (http://www.ingenuity.com), which is a web-based tool for pathway and network analysis of genes.
