Amplification of genomic DNA
The purified DNA was subjected to randomly primed RCA to amplify any DNA present in the water samples, according to the procedure detailed in the GenomiPhi DNA Amplification Kit manual (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). This kit consists of 3 components: the sample buffer; the reaction buffer; and an enzyme mix containing random primers, dNTPs, and Φ29 DNA polymerase [22]. One microliter of the concentrated water sample from either the Prebiocide or Tank A was denatured with 9 µL of sample buffer at 95℃ for 5 min and cooled rapidly on ice. The amplification reaction was performed by adding 9 µL of reaction buffer and 1 µL of enzyme mix to the denatured sample. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30℃ for 16 h. After amplification, the tubes were incubated at 65℃ for 10 min to inactivate the Φ29 DNA polymerase enzyme. The amplified genomic DNA was precipitated by ethanol and then dissolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Most of the random primers and dNTPs were removed after precipitation with ethanol.
