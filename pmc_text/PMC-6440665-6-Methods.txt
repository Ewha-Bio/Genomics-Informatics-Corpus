Quality check
UmiAwareMarkDuplicateWithMateCigar (Picard) counted duplicates among the raw reads to estimate duplicate rates. As this tool is still under development, we recommend a regular check with the developers on further validation. To calculate on-target rates (%), CollectHsMetrics (Picard) is used to generate HsMetrics. By expanding 100 bp of chromosome coordinates (start/end site) in target.bed, on-target %, including flanking regions, was calculated using the same tool. To calculate the read coverage, the following equation was used: Coverage = Read length(bp) Ã— The number of reads/Genome size (bp). According to the manufacturer, the genome size refers to the target size of the probes.
