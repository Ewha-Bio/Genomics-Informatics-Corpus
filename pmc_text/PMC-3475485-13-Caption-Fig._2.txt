Clustering of gene expression patterns in Pkd2 mutant MEF cell lines. We performed clustering analysis microarray data between KO set ratio data and TG set ratio data using the graphical user interface (GUI) system. (A) Gene expression profiles of 2,306 probe sets distributed in a dendrogram. (B) Line plots of each cluster. KO set, ratio between KO MEF and KOWT MEF; TG set, ratio between TG MEF and TGWT MEF. MEFs, mouse embryo fibroblasts; KO, knockout (MEF); TG, transgenic (MEF); KOWT, knockout wild-type (MEF); TGWT, transgenic wild-type (MEF).
