SjS is a chronic autoimmune disease that targets the exocrine glands of the salivary and lacrimal glands primarily, resulting in dry mouth and dry eye, respectively. Similar to many other autoimmune conditions, extraglandular manifestations are commonly seen in patients as well. Therefore, SjS patients may suffer from peripheral/autonomic neuropathy, cognitive impairment, gastroparesis, pancreatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and Raynaud’s phenomenon [3–5]. Approximately, four million Americans are known to be affected by this condition. Current criteria for diagnosis mainly rely on the modified European and American diagnostic criteria proposed in 2002 [6], the SICCA criteria proposed in 2012 [7], and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria proposed in 2016 [8]. In general, these guidelines consider serology for autoantibodies, ocular surface integrity evaluation, minor salivary gland (MSG) lip biopsy, and/or salivary and tear flow rates as main constituents of diagnosis.
