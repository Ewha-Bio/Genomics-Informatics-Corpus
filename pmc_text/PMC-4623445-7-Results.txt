PCR validation of mapping prediction
Thirteen PCR primers designed based on mapping direction validated the mapping results of 10 transgenic insert candidates. PCR results confirmed the target EGF sequence was successfully inserted on rice chromosome 4 (Figs. 3 and 4). The remaining reads were concluded to be artifacts, because all matches were not detected with PCR.
