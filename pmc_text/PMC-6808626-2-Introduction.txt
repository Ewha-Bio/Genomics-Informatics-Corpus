Dependency parsing might be used as a component for tackling many text mining problems. It is often used as a feature to train machine learning algorithms or used for rule-based approaches for relation extraction [1,2]; and can be used to train better word embeddings [3]. However, as continued research and community efforts in the form of the CoNLL shared tasks, for example, show, dependency parsing in general is still not a problem solved completely [4]. Making a fast, reliable dependency parser readily available for the wider research community for further processing to build upon will help spur efforts in event and relation extraction.
As previous research has shown, providing named entity information to the dependency parser can improve the accuracy of the parses [5,6]. The reasoning is that dedicated named entity recognition (NER) tools perform much better in their specific domain, and by extracting named entities with higher accuracy will facilitate appropriate parsing tools that are not trained on biomedical data.
spaCy is a open-source natural language processing (NLP) library written in Python that performs tokenization, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging and dependency parsing. It is the fastest NLP parser available, and offers state-of-the-art accuracy [2,7].
Services such as PubDictionaries and OGER perform dictionary-based entity look up [8]. Other state-of-the-art taggers are the Jensen tagger [9] and TaggerOne [10].
In this work, we present our contribution to BLAH5. We proposed to build a public web service that can be used by researchers and other services, such as PubAnnotation, to obtain improved dependency annotations, based upon integration with a NER service (Fig. 1). We report on its efficacy here.
