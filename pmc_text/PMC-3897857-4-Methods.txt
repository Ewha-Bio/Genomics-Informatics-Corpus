Statistical analysis
We applied student's t-test to evaluate the significance of gene expression differences between the tissue of interest and the other three tissues among the four body fluids. We applied receive operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each marker, using the ROCR package [21] of R software (version 2.6.1). Again, the four body fluids were divided into two groups: a tissue of interest and the remaining three tissues among the four body fluids. Results with a p-value of < 0.05 were considered significant.
