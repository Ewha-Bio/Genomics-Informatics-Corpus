Phylogenetic analysis
To construct the phylogenetic relationship of the 21 Flavobacterium strains, we used the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) software package, version 5.05 [16], with the Kimura two-parameter model and bootstrap analyses, based on 1,000 replications. In addition, we compared the genetic similarity of the six housekeeping genes and the 16S rRNA gene between the genus of Flavobacterium using the pair distance of ClustalW (weighted), which was supported by DNASTAR's MegAlign program in Lasergene, version 5.0 (http://www.dnastar.com). The MEGA program was also used to determine the pairwise distances, G+C contents, and substitution positions.
