Target gene mapping to SNPs using regulatory elements
We used all transcript annotations from GENCODE.v19, which contains 20,242 protein-coding genes. The promoter was defined as the region 1.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site of a gene. When a SNP was in the promoter region of a gene, we assigned the gene to the SNP.
In the case of SNPs that were not assigned using the promoter, we assigned genes using the enhancer that was connected with the promoter of the target gene. We obtained genomewide multiple-cell-type enhancer data from previous studies [9, 10]. Maurano et al. [9] identified distal enhancer-to-promoter connections using DNase I profiles across 349 diverse cell types, and Andersson et al. [10] identified extensive active enhancers and their target promoters by using Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) data based on the FANTOM5 panel of ~400 distinct cell types. We collected a total of 663,583 pairs of enhancers and target genes.
If an SNP was not assigned, we looked for the closest SNP in LD based on CHB/JPT populations (Han Chinese in Beijing, China/Japanese in Tokyo, Japan; Asian ancestry) with an r2 > 0.8 that was within 500 kb using the SNAP proxy tool (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/) [11]. The summary of the number of assigned genes is shown in Table 3.
