Screening of putative drug targets
Availability of whole genome information of B. petrii DSM 12804 (accession No. PRJNA28135) in Genome database of NCBI web server encouraged authors to retrieve the entire set of 5,031 protein sequences in order to identify a potential drug target against it. Primarily, screening was made through identification of essential genes of B. petrii, considered as primitive strategy [26] for target identification. Here, out of total 5,031 proteins, only 1,841 were obtained as essential proteins and hence suspected as primary targets of B. petrii. To remove redundancy [2930] among the putative drug targets, a non-redundancy search was carried out which resulted 1,802 proteins as non-redundant. Search for sequence homology with human proteins is an essential step to be followed for identification of proteins present only in pathogen but not in human [272829]. Again, due to symbiotic relationship among human and human gut micro biota, homology search between proteins of pathogen and human gut flora microorganisms is also a crucial step [3031] to be performed to eliminate the target proteins which are homologous to human gut flora microorganism. The resulted 799 numbers of proteins of B. petrii were not shown any significant similarity with human proteome as well as human gut flora proteome, hence were selected for downstream analysis. Furthermore, the reduction in protein dataset was done by selecting proteins reported as active and as well as functional. Out of 799 proteins, only 509 numbers of functionally characterized proteins were selected using the information available at UniProt database. As suggested by the literature, only cytoplasm proteins are suitable drug targets whereas membrane bound proteins are generally considered for vaccine development [32]. Among them only cytoplasm proteins (334 numbers) were considered for further study. Furthermore, screening was carried out on the basis of evidence report. As of UniProt database report, the evidence which supports the existence of proteins are classified as: (1) experimental evidence at protein level; (2) experimental evidence at transcript level; (3) protein inferred from homology; (4) protein predicted; and (5) protein uncertain. Out of these evidences, evidence at protein level is the best choice for protein existence, as it indicates the existence of the protein experimentally. But in the current investigation, not a single protein has been observed satisfying this criterion. Only 135 proteins which were inferred from homology subjected to virtual study. Identification of pathogenic proteins having virulence factor is also obligatory [31] while screening a drug target against any pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, homology search was carried out between 135 numbers of proteins and the core virulence proteins of B. petrii using VFDB BLAST. The result suggested, out of 135 selected proteins only 26 number of proteins found with virulence factor, which strongly supported for further study to predict potential drug target against B. petrii (Figs. 1 and 2).
