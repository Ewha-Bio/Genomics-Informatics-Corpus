Data processing and quality control (QC)
The QC of sequencing reads was performed with NGS QC Toolkit, and the high-quality reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg19, http://genome.ucsc.edu) using BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) [1] with default parameteres. Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net) was used to remove PCR duplicates. Base quality recalibration and local realignment around indels were performed using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/). Because our previous study showed that the discordance of indel alignments had potential to generate false-positive somatic mutations, we performed the local realignment after the merging of alignments from same patients. Template lengths were calculated using the processed alignments, and the distributions for each samples were plotted to examine the qualities of sequencing libraries. Variant genotyping for each sample was performed with UnifiedGenotyper of GATK, and the variants were filtered as follows: mapping quality zero (MQ0) â‰¥ 4 && MQ0/depth of coverage (DP) > 0.1, variation quality (QUAL) < 200, quality by depth (QD) < 5, Fisher strand (FS) > 60, MQ < 40, DP < 10 (5 if no variant allele), genotype quality (GQ) < 13. The genomic annotation of variants was performed with custom-made scripts and refSeq information.
