Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of all cancers globally. Besides cervical cancer HPV also causes a subset of anogenital, head and neck cancers [12]. Most of the cancer mortality in women worldwide is due to cervical cancer with an estimated 527,624 new cases and 265,653 annual mortality [3]. Among more than 200 HPV types, mostly HPV type 18 and 16 are the main cause of cervical cancer i.e., 15.7% and 62.6%, respectively [4]. Further, HPV 16 and 18 are also associated with penile cancer (63%-80%), vulva/vaginal cancers (80%-86%), anal cancer (93%), oropharyngeal cancers (89%-95%), etc. [5]. Thus, these two HPV types are the main targets for designing anti cancer drugs. The HPV onco-proteins E6 and E7, have been reported to interact with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb respectively [6]. Both p53 and pRb act as negative regulator of cell cycle and inhibit G0-G1 and G1-S phase transitions.
These interactions apparently play important roles in the induction of cell immortality. The importance of p53-mediated apoptosis has been recognized in terms of maintaining homeostasis and preventing neoplastic transformation. E6 forms a ternary complex with p53 and E6 associated protein (E6AP) resulting in the degradation of p53 via ubiquitination pathway [7].
Although HPV has been known to be a causative agent for cervical cancer for more than three decades, the effective treatment against HPV infection is yet to be established [8]. Many natural plant origin compounds have been identified as promising sources of drugs for treatment and prevention of cancer in the recent years [910].
Indole-3-carbinol, an active ingredient of cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, etc. was reported with anti-estrogenic properties in cervical cells [11]. Ursolic acid having anti-mutagenic nature has the potential to induce apoptosis in tumor cells as well as to prevent malignant transformation of normal cells [12]. Resveratrol is a polyphenol isolated from the grapes skin, shown to alter both cell cycle progression and the cytotoxic response to ionizing radiation in cervical tumor cell lines [13]. Curcumin is cytotoxic to cervical cancer cells in a concentration dependent and time-dependent manner and the cytotoxicity was higher in HPV infected cells. It down regulates both serine kinase AKT/nuclear factor ÎºB pathway by sensitizing cancer cells [14]. It also down regulates the expression of HPV oncoproteins, resulting in loss of the transforming phenotype and the cessation of cellular growth. Singh and Singh [15] explored other molecular mechanisms exerted by curcumin in cervical cancer cells, showing that it inhibits telomerase activity, RAS and ERK signaling pathway, cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity [15]. Ginger (active ingredient, gingerol) is a natural dietary component, which has antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties and its supplementation has shown to suppress colon carcinogenesis [16]. Jaceosidin, a active ingredient of Artemisia argyi, reported to inhibit the binding between oncoproteins and tumor suppressors p53 [17]. Through the post-attachment heparan sulfate-independent effect, it is reported that carrageenan block HPV infection by preventing the binding of HPV virions to cells [18]. Due to the antiviral and antitumor properties of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), it was found effective in HPV patients with infected cervical lesions [19]. EGCG also reported as an effective inhibitor of E6/E7 proteins due to its inhibitory effect on the growth of HeLa (HPV18 positive) and CaSki (HPV16 positive) cells in a time and concentration dependent manner [20]. Mahata et al. [21] studied the effect of berberine on HPV16 and HPV18 positive cervical cancer cell line, and observed that it can effectively target both the host and viral factors responsible for development of cervical cancer through inhibition of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 expression. An in vitro study conducted by Karthikeyan et al. [22] reported the radiosensitizing potential of ferulic acid (a natural phenolic acid) on human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and ME-180) [22]. Silymarin, an active ingredient contained in the seeds of the milk thistle plant, reported to inhibit cervical cancer cell [23]. Hu et al. [24] evaluated the anti-tumor effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA), an artemisinin derivative on HeLa and Caski cervical cancer cells and found that DHA treatment caused a considerable inhibition of tumor development [24]. The active compound of Withania somnifera i.e., withaferin A (WA) has reported to have antitumor, antiangiogenic and radiosensitizing activity [2526]. Through in vitro and in vivo study Munagala et al. [27] demonstrated the effective inhibition of proliferation of cervical cancer cells by WA. Further, they showed the down regulation of HPV E6 and restoration of p53 pathway by WA [27].
In the present study, we explicate the atomic interaction between plant-originated ligands and high risk HPV18 E6 oncogenic protein. This study comprises of protein structure modeling of HPV18 E6 protein employing Phyre2 server followed by structural refinement and energy minimization by Yet Another Scientific Artificial Reality Application (YASARA) energy minimization server. To analyze the molecular interaction between HPV18 E6 onco-protein with natural ligands, AutoDock4.2 tool was used in this study.
