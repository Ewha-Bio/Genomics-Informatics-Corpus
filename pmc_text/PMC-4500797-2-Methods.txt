Processing of human genotype data
Genotype data from the HapMap project [13] and 1000 Genomes Project [14] for 70 Yoruba (YRI) lymphoblastoid cell lines were used for DNase-seq analysis [8]. The genotype of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locus was estimated based on the Bayesian framework by means of the BIMBAM tool [15] and the genotype estimates were made available at http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/dsQTL_data/GENOTYPES/. We first selected 2,157,286 genetic markers (SNPs) with the minor allele frequency greater than 30%. To reduce complexity and ease interpretation, we focused on the genetic variants that can change the function of the protein (non-synonymous SNPs) or the abundance of the protein (SNPs associated with the expression level of a nearby gene). The SIFT tool [16] was used to identify non-synonymous SNPs. We performed expression QTL mapping as described below and identified SNPs that were associated (p < 10-5) in cis (within 200 kb from the nearest gene). Taken together, 7,211 SNPs were identified for QTL mapping.
