Data preprocessing
TRAPR provides three types of data preprocessing methods: filtering, transformation, and normalization. TRAPR filtering has six filter types: sample, gene, zero value, low variance, low expression, and gene list. Unlike DNA microarrays that have a fixed number of probes, RNA-Seq explores massive amounts of isoforms and novel transcripts mixed with noise, such that it returns many zeros and nonsense values. Genes encoding miRNAs or snoRNAs often show extremely high expression levels, even though they are treated by a poly-A purification procedure. These outliers can easily be removed by zero-value and gene filters. Statistical power can be improved by low-expression and low-variance filters by reducing non-standard distributions. Analyzing different combinations of samples can conveniently be supported by sample filtering.
TRAPR provides two well-known transformation functions, log2 transformation and VSN, followed by hyperbolic arcsin, arcsin(x), and transformation [11] to standardize data distribution and normalize variance distribution, respectively.
TRAPR provides many normalization methods, including upper quantile [12], quantile, mean, and median normalizations. One can conveniently compare the effect of applying different methods with the following statistical testing and visualization functions.
