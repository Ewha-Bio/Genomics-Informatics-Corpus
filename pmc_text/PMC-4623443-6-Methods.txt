Statistical analysis
The significance of miRNA expression level difference between patients with gastric cancer and cancer-free control subjects was analyzed using Student's t-test. Determination of the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC), and the respective area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed using the R software (version 2.6.1). Results with a p-value of less than 0.05 were considered significant.
