Active site analysis
The active site is the specific region of the target protein responsible for its activity and is constructed of different amino acids. To identify the active site with the determined model, Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins (CASTp) [23] server was used. This provides an online resource for locating, delineating, and measuring concave surface regions on three-dimensional structures of proteins, including pockets located on protein surfaces and voids buried in the interior of proteins.
