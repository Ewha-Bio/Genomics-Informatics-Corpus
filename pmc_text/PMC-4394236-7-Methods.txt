Substrate docking and postdocking simulation
The substrates for the ER and KR domains-namely, the trans butenoyl and β-ketobutyryl groups-were sketched using the 2D draw tool (version 9.3, Maestro; Schrödinger, LLC). The optimal 3D structures of the sketched substrates were generated using Ligprep Module, which fixes ionization states, tautomers, and other stereochemical errors. The correct chiral forms of the optimized substrates were used for docking with the corresponding FASN domains.
Receptor grid files for glide docking were generated to cover the volume of the predicted active sites. Here, van der Waals radius is scaled to 1.0 with a partial cut-off of 0.25 to soften the potential for non-polar parts of a receptor, where other atoms are free of scaling. The receptor grid file and the prepared substrate were docked using Glide standard precision, where the ligand sampling was set to be flexible, ensuring the sample ring conformation and nitrogen inversions. Ligands were set to select only less than 300 atoms and less than 50 rotatable bonds with a van der Waals scaling factor of 0.8 with a partial cut-off of 0.15. Out of the 1,000 poses generated per docking run, 10 energetically favorable poses per ligand were selected. Glide score, an empirical docking scoring function that implements the OPLS 2005 force field, was used to infer the affinity and binding mode of the substrate. The best docked substrate conformation for the ER and KR (holo) domains was subjected to MD simulation for 5 ns, similar to that of the methods discussed for MD simulations of the apo form, except that maximum iterations of 2,000 steps were applied on solute heavy atoms alone with a convergence threshold as 1.0 kcal/mol/Å.
