Multiple-sequence alignment of prototype multicopy single-stranded DNA sequences. The msr/msd portion of each genomic DNA sequence in Table 1 was used to construct the alignment with ClustalW. The corresponding secondary structures, predicted with CentroidFold, are shown in bracket notation. The conserved positions are colored with Jalview.
