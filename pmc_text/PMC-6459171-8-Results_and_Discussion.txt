Immune responses
Alveolar type II cells secrete a variety of anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial substances into the alveolar fluid including surfactant proteins, lysozyme, lipocalin 2 and reduced GSH. A variety of histocompatibility antigens involved in antigen processing and adhesion molecules involved in inflammation were also expressed in type II cells. Pathogen response was mediated by chemokine-guided neutrophil and macrophage influx in pathogen response of lung type II cells [9]. AP1, ATF, and NF-kB transcription factors have a major role in influenza virus and cytokine induced signal transduction pathways and is consistent with the functional role of alveolar epithelium in virus and CD8+ T-cell mediated lung injury [8,21].
