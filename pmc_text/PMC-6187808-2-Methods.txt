Study subjects and genotype data
KD patients in this study were collected from 10 hospitals in Korea. The diagnosis of all KD patients was determined by the diagnostic criteria of the American Heart Association [12, 13]. All laboratory test data were performed before the initial IVIG treatment, including white blood cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin (Hb), C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total protein. A total of 1,699 KD patients in Korea were used in this study. Of them, 118 KD patients were younger than 6 months of age and 231 KD patients were older than 5 years of age. A total of 4,553 controls with no history of KD were obtained from the adult health cohort of the general population in Korea, which included 1,000 controls used in the initial GWAS and 3,500 controls used in the replication study. The GWAS was initially performed using our previous Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 KD patients and 1,000 healthy controls) [14].
From the age-stratified GWAS analysis (19 cases; younger than 6 months of age KD patients and 45 cases; older than 5 years of age KD patients), a total of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 14 SNPs were chosen as age-specific KD susceptibility loci for patients younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age, respectively. Genotyping for the replication study in the 1,403 KD patients, including 99 KD patients younger than 6 months and 186 KD patients older than 5 years of age, were performed using TaqMan assays and analyzed using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The genotypes of the control subjects in Korea were provided by the Biobank for Health Sciences at the Center for Genome Sciences in Cheongwon, Korea. The second replication study using a Japanese cohort was comprised of 1,306 KD cases, including 120 KD cases younger than 6 months of age, and 6,893 controls. Genotype data of the Japanese cohort was generated using the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all KD patients in this study.
