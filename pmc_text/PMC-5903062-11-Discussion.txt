GO results differentiating Hanwoo from Holstein
The differentiation of Hanwoo from Holstein was identified by comparing the genetic substitution rate at the gene level. In GO analysis of differentially substituted genes between Hanwoo and Holstein, the blood and circulatory system terms were most common. The disparate evolutionary patterns after domestication between Hanwoo and Holstein could be caused by these genes. Hanwoo, which mainly provides meat, and Holstein, which mainly provides milk, might evolve differently, and blood and circulatory system-related GO genes could play some role in the evolution of Hanwoo and Holstein.
