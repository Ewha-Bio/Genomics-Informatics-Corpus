Platform of CNV genotyping
We used the Roche NimbleGen 3 Ã— 720 K aCGH platform for CNV calling. This platform was designed as a whole-genome and CNV-focused type, composed of a total of 720,000 probes. The median inter-probe spacing of the backbone was <5 kb. DNA extracted from the NA10851 cell line was utilized as a reference for the aCGH to yield the signal intensity ratio with hg18/NCBI build 36. All of the samples in our study satisfied experimental control metrics, such as chromosome X shift and mad.1dr, with NimbleScan v.2.5 to adapt systemic biases in the microarray experiment. The signal intensity ratio of each probe was converted into log2 scale with the positions of the probes after a quality control process.
