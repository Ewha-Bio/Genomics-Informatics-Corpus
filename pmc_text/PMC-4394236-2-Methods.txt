The amino acid sequences of the ER and KR domains of human FASN, were retrieved from Uniprot Kb/Swissprot server (uniprot ID: P49327). The sequences of the ER and KR domains were 229 and 255 amino acids in length, respectively. The retrieved sequences were BLAST-analyzed against PDB towards identifying suitable templates for homology modeling. From the available crystal structures deposited in PDB during the time of this study (early 2014), the crystal structure of mammalian (porcine, Sus scrofa) fatty acid synthase (chain A, PDB ID: 2VZ8) showed the closest homology and was therefore used as the template for modeling the unbound ER and KR domains.
