Crocodilian systematics has been discussed at higher-level relationships based on morphological, paleobiogeography, and molecular data [1, 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,53,54,55]. However, no study has completely explained crocodilian relationships with their distribution and ecology. Most molecular crocodilian phylogeny contains 23 species (Fig. 1). The use of complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci (nuclear and mt genes) obviously provided the solution for at least three major conflicts of crocodilian clustering: (1) phylogenetic position of G. gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii; (2) relationship of Mecistops cataphractus and Crocodylus; and (3) position of C. siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris. Firstly, the position of G. gangeticus and T. schlegelii was controversial, since G. gangeticus was considered to be Gavialidae at the basal position of Crocodylia based on morphological evidence [153]. The molecular phylogenetic study of complete mt genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci clearly showed that G. gangeticus was a sister-taxon with T. schlegelii, and formed the sister group with the traditional Crocodylidae (Fig. 1) [8910111213141617]. This agreed with molecular sequence-based analyses of the CR1 retrotransposon which suggested that Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) were sisters to all other crocodilians, and supported the G. gangeticus-T. schlegelii clade [56]. Therefore, only the two families (Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae) are now recognized to be within Crocodylia.
The most basal species within Crocodylus and relative species (Osteolaemus tetraspis) is the African sharp-nosed crocodile, M. cataphractus (formerly called Crocodylus cataphractus) [57]. Fossil evidence related to M. cataphractus appeared in the Miocene and Pliocene in Africa [585960], and implied that M. cataphractus was grouped within Crocodylus. However, molecular datasets suggested two relative species of two African crocodiles, M. cataphractus and O. tetraspis, being a sister group to the true crocodiles (Crocodylus) [4891011121314151617]. The last conflict issue concerned the position of C. siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris. In terms of molecular data, a complete mt genome of C. siamensis (DQ353946) showed it as a sister to C. porosus [24], whereas another mt genome sequence of C. siamensis (EF581859) related it to C. palustris [17]. Nonetheless, a molecular study based on the mixture of several molecular loci found in many C. siamensis individuals clearly showed that C. siamensis was sister to C. palustris and that C. porosus was sister to both species [16]. This agreed with karyological data that showed 2n = 30 for C. siamensis and C. palustris, and 2n = 34 for C. porosus (Fig. 1) [1920212226]. The Siamese crocodile sample sequenced by Ji et al. [24] was probably a hybrid between C. siamensis Ã— C. porosus, frequently found in captivity in the crocodile industry [61]. The Siamese crocodile sample sequenced by Srikulnath et al. [17] was confirmed by karyotyping, and showed a chromosome number 2n = 30, a true C. siamensis. However, the relationship within Crocodylus remained unclear because of the position of Indo-Pacific crocodilians (Fig. 1). A molecular study based on complete mt genome sequences strongly indicated two major groups: (1) The Indo-Pacific species and (2) The African-New World (America) species. A molecular study with the mixture of several molecular loci comprising nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggested that the African-New World species grouped with C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis and was a sister clade with the group of Crocodylus mindorensis, Crocodylus novaeguineae, and Crocodylus johnstoni (Fig. 1) [16]. Multiple lines of evidence from biogeography and karyotypes have provided promising data to extensively discuss their evolutionary history.
