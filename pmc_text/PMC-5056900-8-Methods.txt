Sanger sequencing
To validate candidate loci, we conducted PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. A primer pair for the PCR amplification was designed in the flanking region of each target locus using OligoCalc (http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/biotools/oligocalc.html) and Oligo Analysis Tools (http://www.operon.com/tools/oligo-analysis-tool.aspx). Detailed information on the primers is summarized in Supplementary Table 3. PCR was performed in 20 µL of the reaction mixture, including 10 µL of 2× EF-Taq Pre mix4 (Biofact, Daejeon, Korea), 10 µM of oligonucleotide primers, 1 µL of template, and nuclease-free water. PCR was carried out as follows: first denaturation step of 3 min at 95℃, followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at 95℃, annealing of 30 s at optimal temperature, extension of 40 s to 1 min depending on PCR product size at 72℃, and a final extension for 2 min at 72℃. PCR products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and purified with a PCR purification kit (Favorgen Biotech Corp., Pingtung Country, Taiwan). Products were sequenced using an ABI3500 genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Sequencing data were aligned with exome sequencing data by the Bioedit program.
