Plant materials and RNA extraction
Before extraction of mRNA, chromosome numbers were confirmed from root-tip cells. We selected three plants with long acrocentric B chromosomes (Fig. 1). Root-tip collection and chromosome preparation were followed as previously described by Nguyen et al. [18].
Plants were grown in 5-inch wide by 5-inch deep pots with 10 h dark (20℃) and 14 h light (25℃) cycles. For RNA sequencing, 300 mg of fully expanded leaf tissues were collected from each of the three independent biological replicates for 0B and 1B chromosome–containing plants, respectively. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then used to extract RNA. Three biological replicates for each sample were mixed together to reduce inter-individual variations. Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN plant RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quality and concentration of RNA were assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with parameters RIN ≥ 7, 28S:18S > 1, OD260/280 ≥ 2.
