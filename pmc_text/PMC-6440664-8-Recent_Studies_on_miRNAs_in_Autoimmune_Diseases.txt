Connective tissue diseases with interstitial lung disease
A recent study explored the correlation between miR-200c and the severity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients (n = 218) with connective tissue diseases (CTDs) [14]. PBMCs were acquired from SSc (n = 23), dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM, n = 29), pSjS (n = 30), RA (n = 47), and HC (n = 23) for qRT-PCR analyses. The results indicated that the miR-200c level in the SSc group was significantly higher than in the DM/PM, pSjS, and RA groups. The level of miR-200c in the CTDs with ILD group was significantly higher than in the CTDs without ILD group, and the level in the severe ILD group was significantly higher than in the mild ILD group. The authors concluded that the level of miR-200c was positively correlated with the severity of ILD, proposing miR-200c in PBMCs as a biomarker of the severity of ILD in CTDs.
