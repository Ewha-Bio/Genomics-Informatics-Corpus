Patients and collection of clinical data
This study recruited 112 patients diagnosed with NHL at the National Cancer Center in Korea from 2005 to 2012. Patients gave informed consent, which was approved by the institutional review board. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ethnically Korean; (2) available samples at diagnosis; and (3) diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the basis of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9], with or without treatment with an rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP) regimen. There were no recruitment restrictions with regard to gender or cancer stage. The mean age of patients was 56 years, and 62.5% of cases were male.
Chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of six to eight cycles, as decided by the clinician. After every three cycles, the therapeutic response was evaluated. Follow-up was performed every 3 months for the first 2 years; thereafter, the interval was extended to every 6 months. Information on demographic characteristics, including age, IPI, performance status by WHO, cancer stage, and extra-nodal involvement, were evaluated and analyzed.
