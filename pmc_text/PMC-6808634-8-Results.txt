Differential expression profiling of significant GO terms
Of the 154,810 transcripts, 4,157 up-and 3,891 down-regulated genes were found in B-chromosome–containing plants (FDR < 0.05). At the threshold of differential expression value log2FC > |2|, 4,059 transcripts were down-regulated and 3,794 transcripts were up-regulated, accounting for 5.1% of the total transcripts (Table 1). At the stringent threshold log2FC > |10|, we obtained 552 up- and 490 down-regulated transcripts, respectively, accounting for 0.6% of the total transcripts. Heat map analysis revealed differentially expressed patterns that were grouped into two clusters using K-mean clustering (Fig. 2A).
Comparison of GO terms between 0B and 1B chromosome plants revealed multiple DEGs in cellular processes that could potentially account for the de novo occurrence and segregation of B chromosomes (Fig. 2B) [6,7]. Fig. 3 show significantly enriched GO terms involved in the cell cycle and chromosome segregation of genes that were down-regulated in the presence of B chromosomes compared to normal karyotype plants. We found 38 differentially regulated cell cycle–related genes, of which 20 were up-regulated and 18 were down-regulated (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Of the 68 genes related to chromosome segregation, 41 were up-regulated and 22 were down-regulated (Supplementary Table 6). The overall DEGs listed in significant GO terms are listed in Supplementary Table 7.
