Imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-wide association results and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots for p-values. (A) Manhattan plot of MHC complex region-wide association results. The p-values are from the binary markers for imputed HLA alleles (yellow), amino acid residues (red), genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (gray) and intragenic SNPs (deep gray). (B) Q-Q plots of association p-values for MHC binary markers (black), MHC binary markers with allele frequencies (AF)â‰¥0.05 (red), and genome-wide SNPs (blue). Red line denotes the expected values under no inflation. MAF, minor allele frequency.
