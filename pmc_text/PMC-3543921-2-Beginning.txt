Where were you at the start of the new century? What were you doing at that time?
I was in Japan, in Tokyo, in the SNP Research Center (SRC). SRC was founded as a part of the Japanese Millennium Project to study single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The Millennium Project is a broad effort to get industry, academia, and government to cooperate on a wide range of R&D projects to revitalize the competitiveness of the industry and to energize Japan's economy. The project focused on developing technologies for three main target areas of vital importance to Japan: informatics, ecology, and an aging society. A variety of large-scale human genome studies were done as projects to revolutionize medicine and cope with the aging society. In April 2000, SRC started collaboration with the Human Genome Center (HGC), Institute of Medical Science (IMS), University of Tokyo, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Its mission was to identify up to 150,000 SNPs throughout the human genome within two years, to make the information available to the public, and to develop analytical tools for polymorphisms (note: SRC was renamed Center for Genomic Medicine [CGM] in 2008 [http://www.src.riken.jp/]).
SNPs are the most common form of DNA sequence variation. They are the most useful and convenient polymorphic markers to map genes that modify disease susceptibility or those related to drug responsiveness. If we had a dense catalog of SNPs, we could narrow down the loci relating common disease susceptibilities to a small region containing one gene or so by linkage disequilibrium mapping. To get such a catalog, the discovery of a large number of SNPs was first necessary [2].
