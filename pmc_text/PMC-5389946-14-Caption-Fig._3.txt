Genomic contexts for the differentially methylated CpG sites. (A) A plot showing the proportions of the differentially methylated CpG sites across gene-based categories. The p-value was estimated using Fisher's exact tests. Red and blue colors represent the relative over- and under-representation of differentially methylated CpG sites in each of the genomic regions. (B) Shown in relation to the CpG islands (CGIs) in each genomic region. (C) The numbers of obese-hypermethylated and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites identified from the differentially methylated sites are shown. (D) The proportions of obese-hypermethylated and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites are shown with respect to nearby genes. (E) The same proportions are shown with respect to CGI-based categories. TSS1500, 1,500 bp regions upstream of the transcription start site; TSS200, 200 bp regions upstream of the transcription start site; UTR, untranslated region.
