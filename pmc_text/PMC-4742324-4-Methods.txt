Bioinformatic analysis of genes under positive selection
Based on the findings of positive selection, enrichment analysis was performed to examine the biological functions of genes in detected regions. In this study, regions with SNPs under positive selection were extended approximately 10 kb upstream and downstream [16]. We assembled genes located within the extended region using the RefGene from the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/; ver. hg19). Gene enrichment analysis was performed GO terms [17], including biological process, molecular function, cellular component, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis [18] using the DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) tool [19].
