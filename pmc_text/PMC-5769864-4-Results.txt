Regulation in transcription
It is quite unexpected that synonymous codons are somehow linked to the regulation of transcription. Transcription is a process of copying genic sequences into mRNAs, which requires various specific and delicate controls, usually conducted by the combinatorial actions of cis-acting DNA elements and transacting regulatory factors, called transcription factors (TFs). Promoters are well-established controlling cis-acting elements and are generally located upstream of transcription start sites, which are thought to be separate regions from the coding regions of genes.
Recently, Stergachis et al. (2013) [38] reported a surprising observation that approximately 15% of coding regions play roles both as coding sequences for determining amino acids and, astonishingly, as TF binding sites, by DNase footprint analysis in more than 80 different human cell types. Additionally, according to the paper, synonymous codon sites with dual functions are evolutionarily conserved, the binding sites of TFs recognizing stop codons are selectively depleted, and single-nucleotide variants residing within synonymous codons with dual functions can alter TF binding [38]. Therefore, it is plausible that mutations in synonymous sites can lead to obstruction of normal transcription, despite no amino acid alterations being driven.
