MD simulation
MD simulation for both apo and the docked complexes was performed using Desmond 3.6. The simulation was initiated using the OPLS_2005 [21] force field with the system solvated using the simple point charge water model. The system was neutralized by adding 4 Na+ for apo and 6 Na+ counter ions for complexes at a concentration of 4.751 mM. Further, this system was energy-minimized with OPLS_2005. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to restrain the geometry of water molecules and bond lengths and bond angles of heavy atoms [22]. Periodic boundary conditions were applied to stimulate a continuous system [23] and the particle mesh Ewald method for long-range electrostatics [24]. Further, the system was equilibrated with NPT ensemble by setting the temperature and pressure parameters to 300 K and 1.0 bar, respectively. The Berendsen coupling algorithm was chosen for temperature-pressure coupling [25]. Further, the equilibrated system, with a total of 74,931 atoms, was exposed to a simulation period of 5,000 ps with a time step of 2 fs, and trajectories were recorded after every 1.0 ps. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was calculated for the backbone atoms and were graphically analyzed on a time point scale [2627]. Similarly, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) for each residue was also calculated to compare the major conformational changes in the residues between apo and holo forms [28]. The radius of gyration (Rg) was also calculated to infer the compactness of the protein-ligand complex against the apo form [29]. Two-dimensional intermolecular interaction plots depicting the complex stability throughout the MD run were also generated to infer the stability of the protein-ligand complex formation.
