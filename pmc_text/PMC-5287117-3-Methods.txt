Health2 and HEXA datasets
We combined two Korean GWASs, the Health2 study (n = 1,816) and the HEXA study (n = 3,696). The Health2 study consists of community-based cohorts from 5 rural areas (i.e., Wonju, Pyeongchang, Gangneung, Geumsan, and Naju), and the HEXA study is a cohort from 14 urban areas. These samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 6.0. The Health2 and the HEXA cohorts have been described in previous studies [273132]. Missing genotypes were were imputed using Beagle software.
Our investigation was based on the analysis of an external replication dataset of 4,723 samples (1,112 T2D subjects, 3,611 normal subjects) for T2D [33]. The criteria for grouping T2D subjects (nHealth2 = 794, nHEXA = 318) and nondiabetic normal subjects (nHealth2 = 770, nHEXA = 2,841) were FPG level (FPG ≥ 126 for T2D subjects and FPG ≤ 100 for nondiabetic normal subjects) and history of T2D treatment. The demographic variables of the subjects in the Health2 and HEXA cohorts are summarized in Table 1.
