Comparison of risk allele frequencies of known type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) genetic variants among a control group (n = 632, men : women = 287 : 345), T2DM group (n = 761, men : women = 354 : 407), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) group (n = 869) in Koreans. There is an increasing trend of risk allele frequencies from controls to T2DM and from T2DM to GDM. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of the risk variants for risk of T2DM and GDM are shown above the bars.
