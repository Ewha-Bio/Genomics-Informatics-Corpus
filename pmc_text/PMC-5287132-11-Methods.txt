Model refinement
Homology based modeling often contain significant local distortions, including steric clashes, unphysical phi/psi angles and irregular H-hydrogen bonding networks, which render the structure models less useful for high-resolution functional analysis. Refinement of structures could be a solution of this problem [28]. To refine the predicted model Mod-Refiner (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/); an algorithm for atomic-level, high-resolution protein structure refinement is used.
