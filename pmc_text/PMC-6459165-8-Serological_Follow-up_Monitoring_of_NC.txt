Our research group assessed changing patterns of specific antibody levels after medical treatment. A total of 69 patients with NC participated in the study. The intervals and number of examinations during the follow-up period varied according to the patient (up to 22 months). Serially-collected serum and CSF samples were examined simultaneously for their specific IgG antibody levels by ELISA using a CF antigen. Individual patients showed a typical pattern of specific IgG antibody levels after treatment (Fig. 5). Within four-month post-treatment, the antibody levels were temporarily elevated in both the serum and CSF in most patients. However, in some cases, antibody levels steadily declined after treatment. Some samples that showed a negative antibody reaction before treatment turned out to be positive after treatment. This result suggested that follow-up examinations could be beneficial as a complementary tool (provocation test) in serodiagnosis. One to two months were considered to be a sufficient interval for initial follow-up surveillance for that purpose [41]. However, at the 22-month follow-up, most NC patients with a long history did not show any significant changes in specific antibody levels in either the serum or CSF. These results demonstrated that yearly serologic follow-up should be continued for at least 5 years after treatment to differentiate cured patients from chronic patients with slowly calcifying lesions.
