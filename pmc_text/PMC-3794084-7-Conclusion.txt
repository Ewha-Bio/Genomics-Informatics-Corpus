The emergence of viral metagenomics has facilitated advances in virology and allowed us to understand novel aspects of viral ecology. At present, viral metagenomics is a powerful and sensitive technique for detecting viruses that cannot be identified by traditional culture- and sequence-based approaches. Most importantly, viral metagenomics suggests that novel viruses interact constantly with the human population. Thus, viral metagenomics can facilitate the improved surveillance of viral pathogens in the fields of public health and food security. This technique can be used to understand viral ecology by exploring the environmental viromes that are generated by viral metagenomics.
