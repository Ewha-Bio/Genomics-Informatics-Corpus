Single-cell sequencing technologies already have led to many discoveries in the field of cancer immunology and proven it can provide further insight into our understanding of intratumor heterogeneity, immunoediting, and immunogenicity that are difficult to resolve from bulk sequencing. Nevertheless, many dynamic tumor processes remain poorly understood. With the continual advances in single-cell methods at an ever more affordable cost, the repertoire of new data across additional tumor types and at unprecedented sample size will aid in capturing individual cell states at the transcriptional, regulatory, and translational layers. In combination with functional work, these mechanistic insights can be used to identify prognostic biomarkers, monitor circulating tumor cells, map rare cell population, estimate and stratify tumor and tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, and, finally, be used to identify therapy resistance mechanisms. Ultimately, these approaches will guide the way to detection of single-cell signatures in cancer, precisely manipulate immunity with therapy and vaccination to overcome immune suppression, revitalize immune surveillance, and stabilize or hopefully revert the tumor phenotype in cancer patients.
