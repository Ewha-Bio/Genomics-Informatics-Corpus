Marinobacter species is one of the most ubiquitous classes formed in the marine ecosystem. It occurs throughout the water column in deep oceans, and it exerts a significant impact on various biogeochemical cycles. Marinobacter aquaeolei is involved in redox reactions that utilize oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors [1]. It exhibits hydrocarbon-degrading mechanisms and is capable of diverse extremophilic attributes (psychrophily, oligotrophy, and halotolerance) [2]. Marinomonas MWYL1 is able to grow on the betaine molecule and use dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) as their sole carbon source. Dimethyl sulphide is released as a by-product of metabolism of DMSP and reaches the atmosphere, which subsequently forms cloud condensation nuclei during oxidation [3]. The key gene (dddD) in M. MWYL1 encodes for acetyl-CoA transferase, which adds CoA to DMSP, prior to its subsequent cleavage [4]. Thus, M. MWYL1 is involved in the cycling of the climate-changing gas DMS, and their genomic potential still needs to be unraveled. Nitrobacter hamburgensis, a gram-negative bacterium, forms a biofilm, which is considered a suitable alternative for the treatment of wastewater that otherwise requires large and expensive reactors for efficient bioremediation [5]. Nitrobacter winogradskyi inhabits many soil types, natural stones, as well as both fresh and salt water. It derives its energy at once through nitrite oxidation and carbon dioxide fixation, thus acting as a chemolithoautotroph. The gammaproteobacterium class of Nitrosococcus oceani is an obligate chemolithoautotroph capable of extracting energy and reducing power from the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite. N. oceani's impact on the ecosystem is the massive release of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen gases into the atmosphere, thus completing the nitrification cycle. It also contributes to the maintenance of concentrations of nitrate in the nitrogen pool of the deep ocean at 40 ÂµM [6].
