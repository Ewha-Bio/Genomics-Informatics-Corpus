Network modeling and analysis
Functional molecules or cellular networks altered under disease conditions interact closely with each other to form a disease-perturbed cellular network. The network model enables identification of hub-like molecules that can serve as core indicators of the activities of cellular processes described in the network model. Thus, it is important to understand the disease-perturbed cellular network to identify the core indicators as the biomarker candidates. The core molecules and their associated cellular pathways have been further suggested as therapeutic targets or the biomarker candidates that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments (e.g., drug efficacy) for the target disease. Hence, the network-based approaches have been employed for protein biomarker discovery.
The network-based approaches first reconstruct a disease-perturbed cellular network model describing the interactions of the DEPs or a subset of the DEPs involved in the selected GOBPs related to the target disease using protein-protein (PPIs), protein-DNA (PDIs), and/or protein-metabolite interactions (PMIs) in the following interactome databases (Table 1, Fig. 2): (1) PPI databases: human protein reference database (HPRD) [44], biological general repository for interaction datasets (BioGRID) [45], biomolecular interaction network database (BIND) [46], search tool for recurring instances of neighbouring genes (STRING) [47], and Molecular INTeraction database (MINT) [48]; (2) PDI databases: EdgeExpressDB (FANTOM4-EEDB) [49], transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) [50], MSigDB [41], MultiNet [51], and MetaCore [40]; and (3) PMI database: KEGG pathway database [52].
Next, the network model are analyzed to identify network modules or clusters each of which includes a set of the nodes densely connected in the network (Fig. 2). For network clustering or modularization, a number of methods, such as jActiveModules [53], ResponseNet [54], NetWalker [55], and clusterMaker [56], have been developed (Table 1). These methods can be categorized into two groups. One group, such as clusterMaker, searches for the node clusters based on the network topology information such that the nodes in the same cluster have dense connections, but sparse connections between the different clusters [56]. The other group, such as jActiveModules, uses the quantitative fold-changes of the nodes between control and patient samples measured by LC-MS/MS together with the network topology information. In this group, the node clusters are identified such that the nodes in the same clusters are densely connected and also show similar alteration patterns in protein abundance [53].
For functional interpretation of the node clusters resulted from network clustering, functional enrichment analyses mentioned above are then performed for the nodes in each network cluster. Of the node clusters, prior to the enrichment analysis, we can focus on the major network clusters including large numbers of the DEPs. The functional enrichment analysis then provide a subset of the major network clusters whose functions (e.g., GOBPs or KEGG pathways) are associated with the disease-related cellular processes. This subset can be considered as potential determinants of the disease-perturbed cellular network. Finally, the hub-like DEP in each major network cluster is selected as a biomarker candidate that can reflect the perturbation of the disease-related cellular process associated with the network cluster. Mitra et al. [57] demonstrated the power of the network-based biomarker discovery approach in prediction of metastatic cancers in human breast cancer. They identified network clusters with dysregulated expression using SigArSearch and showed that the network clusters were more accurate in distinguishing metastatic cancers from non-metastatic cancers, compared with individual cancer-gene markers.
