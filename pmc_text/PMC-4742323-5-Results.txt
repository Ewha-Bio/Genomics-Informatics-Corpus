G64 up-regulating cancers tend to have a poor prognosis in six different cancers
We next investigated whether patient survival was significantly different in these three groups classified by the average intensity of G64 expression. Patient survival rates were compared among the three patient groups for each of the 22 cancers. As done in the LADC study, we performed Kaplan-Meier analysis using the patients' survival data obtained from the TCGA in each type of cancer. Survival rates were compared between the lowest 15% versus highest 15% groups (i.e., P1 comparison in Table 1), the lowest 15% versus intermediate groups (i.e., P2 comparison in Table 1), and the intermediate versus highest 15% groups (i.e., P3 comparison in Table 1). PCA confirmed the groups' separations by G64 expression (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). As summarized in Table 1, only six cancers were shown to have statistically significant differences between groups, including KIRC, brain lower grade glioma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal papilloma cell carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and sarcoma. In all comparisons between groups in these 6 cancers, G64 up-regulation was consistently observed to be associated with worse patient prognosis in the Cox regression analysis (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
The 22 cancers were subsequently divided into two batches: i.e., six survival-differentiating cancers and 16 survivalnon- differentiating cancers. After the RNA-seq samples from the 22 cancers were collected as separate batches, we examined the aspect of survival difference by G64 expression in each batch. Consequently, the survival-differentiating batch, mixing up six different cancer samples (531 + 514 + 351 + 289 + 184 + 257 = 2,126 samples), clearly maintained the survival differentiation among the lowest 15%, the highest 15%, and the intermediate groups (Fig. 2), whereas the survival-non-differentiating batch, mixing up 16 different cancer samples (178 + 373 + 302 + â€¦. + 179 + 150 = 5943 samples), showed no survival difference among the three different groups determined by G64 expression levels (Fig. 2). Taken together, the G64 genes can differentiate cancer samples by their survival rate differences in cancers other than LADC.
