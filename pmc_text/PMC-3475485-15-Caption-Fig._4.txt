Expression verification of AQP1 at the protein level. (A) Western blot analysis of AQP1 in MEFs and kidney tissues derived from Pkd2 KO (or heterozygote) and PKD2 TG mice. PKD2 TG and TGWT mice: 18 mo; Pkd2 heterozygote and KOWT mice: 12 mo. Anti-Î²-actin was used as the internal control. (B) For quantification of western blot, Multigauge software (Fuji Film) was used. AQP1, aquaporin 1; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; KO, knockout; TG, transgenic; KOWT, knockout wild-type (MEF); TGWT, transgenic wild-type (MEF).
