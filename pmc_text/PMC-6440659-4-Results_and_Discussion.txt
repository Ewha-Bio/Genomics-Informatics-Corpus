Web server implementation
We constructed a web server, named STADIUM (Species-specific tRNA adaptive index compendium; http://stadium.pmrc.re.kr). The codes for STADIUM were written in the R programming language (version 3.4.4) with the package ‘shiny,’ which is a web application framework. Fig. 5A shows screenshots of STADIUM. It consists of several tabs. In the web interface, users can browse the stAI values of genes by selecting species (Fig. 5B). On the same page, relative adaptiveness values of 61 codons and stAI values categorized by KEGG pathway are available. In the ‘Browse by pathway’ tab, users can select a pathway; then, summarized statistics of stAI values in each species and a boxplot are provided (Fig. 5C). Also, the raw data calculated in this work can be downloaded in the ‘Download’ tab (Fig. 5D).
