Biochemical measures
Biochemical data from KoGES were obtained through the Korean Association Resource (KARE) project. Blood samples were obtained from the participants with at least 8 hours of overnight fasting. Serum total cholesterol (TCHL), HDLC, and TG concentrations were measured using the Advia 1650 analyzer (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) for the Ansung and Ansan cohorts and the Hitachi 7600 analyzer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) for the Seoul and Busan study cohorts [16, 17]. LDLC concentration was estimated using the equation by Friedewald et al. [18] for individuals with TG levels lower than 400 mg/dL.
