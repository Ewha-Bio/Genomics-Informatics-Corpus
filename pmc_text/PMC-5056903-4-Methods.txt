Ligand preparation and molecular docking
Chemical structures of 13 natural compounds (allicin, ajoene, andrographolide, baicalin, carvacrol, catechin, coumarin, curcumin, menthol, eugenol, theaflavin, tinosporon, and ursolic acid) (Fig. 1), along with Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers, reported in the literature were retrieved from the PubChem database (Table 1) [25]. Both ligands and receptor molecule (H1N1 NA) was prepared in AutoDock4.2 program [26]. AutoDock is used to predict small molecule to the receptors of known 3D structure. The ligand and target protein were given as input and the flexible docking was performed. The negative and low value of Î”G bind indicates strong favorable bonds between protein and the novel ligand indicating that the ligand was in its most favorable conformations [26]. Docking studies were carried out as per the normal methodology for protein-ligand docking used by Kumar et al. [27] and Jagadeb et al. [28].
