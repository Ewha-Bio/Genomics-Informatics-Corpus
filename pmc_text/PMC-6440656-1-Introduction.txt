In genome-wide association studies, many associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypes have been successfully discovered in many studies [1]. Despite the success of association studies, a large part of heritability remains unexplained as missing heritability [2]. Gene-gene interactions, rare variants, and structural variations are pointed to as causes of missing heritability.
For the detection of gene-gene interactions, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method has been proposed by the reduction from genotype values of an SNP combination to a binary variable having a value of “high risk” or “low risk” [3]. This method has been widely expanded for specific objectives, such as balanced accuracy for imbalanced data [4], generalized MDR for covariate adjustments and continuous phenotypes [5] for survival phenotypes [6, 7], and odds ratio-based MDR [8], etc. [9–14].
Among MDR expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for an adaptation of membership function for reflecting the uncertainty of “high risk” or “low risk,” and detection rate increases have been verified in many simulations [15]. Fuzzy-MDR has been expanded for covariate adjustments and continuous phenotypes [16] and maximum likelihood estimator as the membership function as empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR) [17].
In EFMDR, a maximum likelihood estimator for each genotype is a membership value of ‘high risk’ or ‘low risk’ for the genotype. It has been proven that values of fuzzy balanced accuracy, based on maximum likelihood estimations, follow a chi-square distribution. Therefore, there is no need for cross-validation of p-value calculations. However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script only.
