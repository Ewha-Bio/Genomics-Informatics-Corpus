Study subjects
Between August 2001 and November 2010, blood samples were collected from 720 subjects, including 360 lung cancer patients and 360 normal controls without cancer. Lung cancer patients were recruited from the patient pool at the Genomic Research Center for Lung and Breast/Ovarian Cancer, and control subjects were randomly selected from a pool of healthy volunteers who had visited the Cardiovascular Genome Center and Genomic Research Center for Allergy and Respiratory Diseases. Detailed information on diet, smoking status, drinking status, lifestyle, and medical history were collected by trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire. Out of 360 cases, information was available for 352 on smoking status, 317 on stage, and 343 on cell type, while information was available for 272 on smoking status of 360 controls. All study subjects provided written consent and were ethnic Koreans, and all participating Institutional Review Boards approved the study protocol.
