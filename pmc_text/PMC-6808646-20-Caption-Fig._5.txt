Optimization of the tag mix between up- and down-tags. For the best resolution of tag intensity, up- and down-tags were mixed at the indicated ratios with various concentrations of blocking oligonucleotides (shown as insets), and subjected to intensity analysis. A 1:1 mix between up- and down-tags resulted in the best resolution of tag intensity.
