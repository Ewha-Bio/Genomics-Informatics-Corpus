Conclusion
Using an innovative in silico approach, all 674 HPs from S. flexneri were primarily analyzed and then using the ROC analysis and confidence level measurements of the predicted results the functions of the 39 HPs were precisely predicted with a reasonably high degree of confidence and thereby were successfully characterized. Following this, the validation of the functions of these proteins were carried out by using different approaches including structure based PS2-v2 server, sub-cellular localization and physicochemical parameters. These are important for distinguishing the HPs from the rest of the protein. The protein-protein interaction also gave insights in elucidation of the involvement of such proteins in various metabolic pathways. Moreover, some virulence proteins had also been detected which are essential for the survival of this pathogen. This in silico approach for functional annotation of the HPs can be further utilized in drug discovery for characterizing putative drug targets for other clinically important pathogens. The outcomes of ROC analysis indicated high reliability of bioinformatics tools used in this study. Hence, the functional annotation of HPs is reliable and can be further utilized for other experimental research.
