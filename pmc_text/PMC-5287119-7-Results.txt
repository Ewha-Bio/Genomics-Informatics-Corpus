We have carried out an interaction analysis on T2D in the KARE cohort on the genome-wide scale; 8,773 subjects with 304,245 SNPs were considered for detecting gene-gene interactions. Missing genotypes were imputed with Impute2 [17] software.
We applied the proposed two-stage approach to identify the genome-wide significant gene-gene interactions. The analyses were completed within 42 h with an Intel Core i3-4130 CPU 3.40 GHz desktop. A total of 46,282,357,890 interactions were executed, and the Bonferroni-adjusted 0.05 genome-wide significance level is 1.08e-12. Promising pairs of SNPs were selected with BOOST, and 229,965 pairs of SNPs were selected with BOOST; then 229,965 pairs of SNPs were analyzed with logistic regression.
To perform adjustments for the population substructure between individuals, we used the EIGENSTRAT [18] method. EIGENSTRAT calculates the genetic similarities among subjects by using a genetic relationship matrix and applies PC analysis. The generated PC scores are then utilized as covariates for genetic association analyses, and this approach guarantees robustness against a population substructure. Here, we calculated the first 10 PC scores, and they were included as covariates for the logistic method in R. Sex, age, and BMI were also included as covariates in the analysis.
Most significant results for interaction analyses with KARE datasets are listed in Table 1. Only the top 10 significant SNP pairs are listed. The most significant interaction effect with a p-value of 3.11E-11 was found for rs1402142 and rs8012584. The former is associated with the genes HTRA3, AREG, TEC, and NRAS (Table 2), which are related to metabolic, immune, and hematological diseases, and the latter is associated with the genes ANG and ABCB1, related to neurological and metabolic diseases. Our results show that even the interactions are significant, but their marginal effects may not be. There are some interesting results that rs872234 is near DHFRP2, which is related to diabetes mellitus type 1 [19], and rs1110144 and rs1104853 are both in CNTNAP2 [20] and MIR548T, respectively; they are also known to be associated with diabetes.
