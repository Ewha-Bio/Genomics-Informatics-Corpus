Search for candidate TFs based on regulatory motif and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing
The regulatory factors for insulin-responsive genes were searched using the iRegulon app in Cytoscapev3.2.1. iRegulon detects the TFs and their targets by scanning known TF-binding promoter motifs as well as the predicted motifs discovered from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data. We set 20-kb upstream for the options "Putative regulatory region," "Motif rankings database," and "Track rankings database." Other options were taken as default. We executed iRegulon and looked for TFs for each down and up regulated genes.
