TC calculation
TC was calculated using the following relationships:
(2) TC = effect   of   gene t r a n s c r i p t   r e a d s
Eq. (2) uses the gene effect and transcript reads (TPM) to determine the TC. We assumed that the effect of the gene was proportional to the transcript reads and TC. The gene effect is proportional to TC as given in Eq. (2). If A and B genes’ effect is 10, 10, respectively and transcript reads are 1,000 and 10,000, then TCs of A and B are 0.01 and 0.001. Thus the capacity of the A transcript is 10-fold stronger than B transcript. One unit of A transcripts influences 10-fold to the traits in comparison to the B transcripts.
