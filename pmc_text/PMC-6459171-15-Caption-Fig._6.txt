Heat map representation of differentially expressed transcription factors during mouse lung development. Raw data values were normalized and are shown as rlog and a >2-fold change were represented by blue and red colors in either direction. Transcription factors with differential expression are shown during development. Lung type II markers such as Sftpc and Lyz2 were included for the purpose of comparison.
