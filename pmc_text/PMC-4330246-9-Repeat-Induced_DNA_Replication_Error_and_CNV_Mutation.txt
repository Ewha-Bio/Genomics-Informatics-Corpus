DNA repair and nonhomologous end-joining
While DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is one of the molecular mechanisms for repairing DSBs and maintaining genome integrity. Once a DSB is detected, the broken DNA ends are bridged and modified by the enzyme machinery. After that, the final ligation is needed for DNA repair. Unlike NAHR, NHEJ can take place without any homology as the substrate. Notably, deletions or insertions of several base pairs are usually brought to the joint point. More mechanistic details of NHEJ are provided in some previous works [66, 67, 68].
