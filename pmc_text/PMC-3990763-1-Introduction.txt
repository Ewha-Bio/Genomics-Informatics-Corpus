Among cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer occurring in children and is the driving paradigm for the work presented in this paper. Despite presenting with similar clinical features, ALL patients do not always respond in a similar manner to the same treatment strategies. The underlying complexities of the disease are not always clearly reflected by the clinical presentation or pathological results. Genomic variation, typified by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have considerable influence on how humans develop diseases and respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs, vaccines, and other agents [1]. Similarly, gene expression patterns in diagnostic bone marrow can predict the sub-type of pediatric ALL as well as indicate relapse potential [2, 3]. The co-regulated activity of genes leads to metabolic actions that are driven by small changes in the expression of a large number of genes rather than large changes in only a few [2]. As a result, understanding genomic data and biomedical data (e.g., annotated clinical attributes, treatment details, domain ontologies, and patient's background) is crucial to improving the diagnosis and treatment of ALL.
As a rule, the knowledge discovery process involves the dialog between experts from different domains, including laboratory scientists, biostatisticians, computational biologists, and clinicians. In reality, most techniques were developed based on statistical analysis with simple visualization [4] in an attempt to create techniques that would be applicable in several domains. Basic statistics and visualizations without effective interaction and capabilities to control the visual data mining process are often insufficient for the analysis and exploration processes.
Intelligent visualization of complex genomic data will therefore bring the insight of information as well as the discovery of relationships, non-trivial structures, and irregularities that may pertain to the disease course of the patient. Genomic datasets are complex data structures with measurements for millions of SNPs affecting the activity of several thousand genes. These genomic 'attributes' are built into models that inform us about individual patients and allow cross-referencing and determining the interconnections between patients. It is important then to provide adequate tools in order to visualize these models and interactions and to simultaneously examine many attributes in the context of relevant clinical properties that can be measured in real time for the purpose of assessing a patient's clinical course and directing his clinical management.
Fundamentally, a large number of attributes need to be reduced to a manageable size so that data visualization techniques can be effectively applied. Typical dimensionality reduction methods applied to microarray data include principle component analysis [5], non-negative matrix factorization [6], multidimensional scaling [7], and local linear embedding [8]. The choice of method to apply depends to some extent on the nature of the information expected to be encoded in the dataset, since the quality of the resulting reduced matrices can vary across different datasets. Remarkably, most of the visualization techniques use matrix heatmaps, genomic coordinates, or networks (or pathways metaphor) to represent multidimensional genomic data [9,10,11].
- Heatmaps are common graphical representations that are used to present genomics values as matrices of colors. Matrix heatmaps are typically represented as rectangles (such as cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [12] and Caleydo StratomeX [13]) and occasionally as circles (such as CircleMap [14]).
- Genomic Coordinates represent oncogenomics data by showing alterations tied to their genomic loci. This approach is only suitable for analyzing the genomic topography of alternations or for inspecting particular genomic loci [9]. Typical techniques in this approach are Genomics Viewer [15], UCSC Cancer Denomics Browser [16], and Savant Genome Browser [17].
- Networks (or graphs) can be used to show changes in state for 1) interpreting and exploring large biological networks and 2) assembly and curation of pathways (such as Cytoscape [18], VANTED [19], VisANT [20], NAViGaTOR [21], and Cerebral [22]).
Visualization techniques for gene expression techniques that include reasonably advanced visualizations are presented in [23,24,25]. Other good visualization tools show the interdependencies of genes by bringing gene expression into context with pathways [26] or using dimension reduction methods to provide multi-dimensional data visualizations [27]. Web-based visual analysis integrates multiple visualization components, such as scatterplot, phylogenetic tree, and genome-wide circus viewer, to enable the analysis [28]. Although these tools provide somewhat effective ways for the analysis of data, they do not effectively present the data such that medical analysts can interactively explore and manipulate the information. Our approach seeks to provide a capability for viewing patients in the similarity space based on detailed genomic and gene of interest analysis, representing the underlying biological basis for the disease.
This paper presents a novel visual analysis approach and a tool where medical scientists can interrogate large and complex genomic and biological data. We focus on patient-to-patient comparisons through the biological data, including background and treatment, and high-dimensional genomic data, including Affymetrix expression microarrays and Illumina SNP microarrays. The innovation lies in its capability of providing seamless and multiple views of data, from overview of the entire patient population with the similarity space to overviews, detailed views, and genes of interest (GOI) views of selected items, for patient-to-patient comparison. The technology provides various ways to display the multi-dimensional data in cooperation with the automated analysis. In addition, by integrating domain knowledge into the development, we have provided meaningful visualization for medical data analysis as well as a quality assurance tool to verify the effectiveness of the automated analysis.
