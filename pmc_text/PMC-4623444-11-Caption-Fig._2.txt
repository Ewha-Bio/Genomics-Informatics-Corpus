A representative regulatory network using iRegulon in Cytoscape. The node with purple and green represent the up-regulated genes after insulin treatment and their predicted regulators (MEF2A, YY1, and SRF), respectively. Genes linked to two or three regulators may be regulated by those multiple regulators. The target genes for each transcription factor are portrayed by different edge colors.
