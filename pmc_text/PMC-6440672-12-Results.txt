Integrated study of selected gene markers
Along with the selected genetic markers and clinical variables, we fitted a multiple Cox regression model. The genetic markers chosen for the final model were REN, LEFTY1, and AP1S2. From the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database [16], we found out that these genes belong to the following pathways, respectively: KEGG RENIN ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM, KEGG TGF BETA SIGNALING PATHWAY, and KEGG LYSOSOME. The false discovery rate q-values from the univariate Cox regression with a single gene were 0.693, 0.687, and 0.138, respectively. These q-values mean that those genetic markers cannot be selected through the false discovery rate procedure with a level of 0.1 via univariate Cox regression.
For further integrated study of the selected gene markers, we grouped patients into two groups—high- and low-risk— using the fitted hazard ratios. As shown in Fig. 1, the two groups were well separated, with a log-rank test p-value of 8.02×10−6. We could see that our model predicts the prognosis of patients quite well. The three selected genes have been reported to have an association with ovarian cancer in previous studies. The renin-angiotensin system works as an angiogenic factor through type 1 angiotensin receptors. These angiogenic factors have a correlation with ovarian cancer patient survival [17]. Lefty1 is an activator of the TCEA3 gene, the expression of which is related to cell death in ovarian cancer [18]. Lastly, AP1S2 has been reported as a prognostic marker of ovarian cancer, and its expression level is differentially changed in drug-resistant cell lines [19, 20].
