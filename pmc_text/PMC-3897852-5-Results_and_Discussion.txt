Comparative analysis of mutations between non-metastatic and metastatic samples
TCGA provides annotations for the stage of metastasis in each patient sample from the clinical data. According to these data, thousands of samples for 8 cancer types, except for OV, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and UCEC, were classified into 89 metastatic and 1341 non-metastatic samples in order to compare the mutation frequency between them. The annotation for metastasis was not provided for the excluded cancer types-OV, GBM, and UCEC. Interestingly, metastatic samples had similar mutation frequencies as non-metastatic samples for most cancer types (Fig. 2). Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) had significant (p < 0.01) difference in frequency between metastatic and non-metastatic samples. This result implied that there is no differential occurrence of mutations between metastatic and non-metastatic samples, except in minor case.
