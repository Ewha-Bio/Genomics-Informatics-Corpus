The overall scheme of our classification is depicted in Fig. 2. We first divided genes into two classes (A and B) by paired t test without considering age. A total of 5,962 genes in class A were defined as significant DEGs in breast cancer, and 13,684 in class B were nonsignificant. Ones who want to find biomarkers or driver genes are likely to investigate only genes in class A. However, we classified the genes of each class once again into eight groups, based on the pattern of p-values, which were calculated separately for every age group (secondary classification in Fig. 2). After a second round of classification, the genes were eventually divided into 16 classes (A1–B8) (Supplementary Table 1). The numbers of genes of the classes are shown in Table 1.
It was easily observed that there was no gene classified as class B1. Probably, this was because the significance of genes in class B was already tested in the primary classification step, and no genes showed significance over all age groups. The 377 genes in class A1 exhibited differential expression for every age group and all samples. These genes are the most powerful DEGs between normal and breast cancer cells. Genes of class 2, which did not have significantly different expression in any age group, accounted for the majority in both classes A and B. Indeed, classes 1 and 2 did not have any age-specific significance. Thus, we focused on the genes of classes 3–8, which showed age-specific differential expression (Fig. 3).
Functional enrichment analysis for each class was performed, but we could not find any relevant or intriguing biological implications or pathways related to breast cancer. Hence, we decided to provide the results of the analysis as raw data (Supplementary Table 2) rather than trying an unfeasible deduction.
To show an example of how the classification can be applied, we constructed prediction models that aimed to distinguish normal and breast cancer cells, using the expression values of various combinations of genes. We defined two types of combinations comprising gene lists. For type I combinations, genes were chosen evenly from each class. By contrast, genes were chosen randomly for type II combinations without considering gene class. For example, if we make a list composed of three genes from classes 3, 4, and 5, the type I combination should consist of a gene from class 3, another from class 4, and the other one from class 5, but a type II combination could be composed of any genes randomly chosen from the pool of the three classes.
We compared the accuracies of the SVM of type I and II combinations for three subsets each for classes A and B (Table 2). The performance of type I was significantly better than that of type II, except in two cases (classes 6–8 in both classes A and B), the genes of which were significantly differentially expressed in the two age groups.
These results highlight the value of gene classification based on our method. Based on the first classification, 13,684 genes in class B were probably considered genes that cannot distinguish normal and breast cancer cells. However, by adapting one more classification step based on age-specific differential expression, we identified 171 age-specific DEGs in classes B3–B8. Despite the underestimated value of the classes, we showed that a balanced selection of genes from these classes could be applied as biomarkers, identifying breast cancer from normal cells. For example, genes that are known to be high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, such as TP53, STK11, and CDH11, and moderate-penetrance genes, such as RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, NBS1, and FANCM, were classified in class B2 [19]. In addition to proposing the possibility of genes in class B as biomarkers, even for class A, we exhibited that our method of selecting biomarker genes based on secondary classification could be useful in making a combination of biomarker genes for a more accurate prediction by using different classes complementarily.
In summary, we retrieved a gene expression dataset of breast cancer and matched normal cells from TCGA and then classified the genes into 16 classes by two-step classification. This classification could be applied to generate a more accurate prediction model for identifying cancer. Furthermore, we expect that our scheme of classification could be used for other types of cancer data.
