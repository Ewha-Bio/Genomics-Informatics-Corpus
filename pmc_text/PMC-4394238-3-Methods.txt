Linear referencing
LR is one of the GIS tools representing geographic locations of linear events based on relative positions on linear features [18], where the beginning and end of the events are recorded as measurement values in event tables. Using LR, attributes are linearly referenced and linked dynamically to layers (e.g., the genome). This technique can be effectively used to represent genomes and genes as layers and linear events, respectively. By applying this technique, the genomic data initially stored in event tables can be visualized, displayed, queried, and analyzed on the genome network. The LR method provides flexibility to split a linear genome into new sets of gene segments (i.e., line events), without having to draw a new line layer for gene events. As presented in Fig. 1, the LR process includes the fields of location and attribute(s) associated with gene events. As shown, the line gene events are related to the genome layers through the values of the field "Genome-ID." The location of line events (genes) on a given genome layer is indicated in the fields "Start" and "End." In other words, a line event uses both "Start" and "End" measure values to describe a portion (i.e., a gene) of a genome.
