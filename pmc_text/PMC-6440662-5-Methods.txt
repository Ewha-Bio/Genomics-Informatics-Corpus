Phase III
Performance assessment
The predicted functions of HPs from S. flexneri and the accuracy of associated tools were validated using the ROC curve analysis. In this analysis, the diagnostics efficacy is evaluated at six levels where 1 and 0 classified as true positive and true negative respectively as binary numerals. In addition, the integers (2, 3, 4, and 5) were used as confidence ratings for each case. The ROC curves were carried out using 25 S. flexneri proteins with known function as control and were compared with the results obtained for the 39 HPs (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). The results were submitted to web-based calculator for the ROC curves [53] in “format 1” form and the program thereby calculated the ROC curves. The results were expressed in terms of accuracy (Ac), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and the area under the curve (AUC) [54]. The average accuracy of the employed pipeline was found 93.6% (Table 3, Fig. 2).
