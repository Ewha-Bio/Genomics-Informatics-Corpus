Genome-wide association results and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots for genome-wide association study p-values. (A) Manhattan plot of genome-wide association results. Within each chromosome position shown on the x axis, log10 (p-values) of the association statistics are visualized on the y-axis. The red line denotes genome-wide significance (5.7 Ã— 10-7). (B) Q-Q plot of association p-values. Red line denotes the expected values under no inflation.
