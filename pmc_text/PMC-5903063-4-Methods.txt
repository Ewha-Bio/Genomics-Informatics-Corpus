Genotype imputation and estimation of imputation accuracy
Locations of the 8 MS on UMD3.1 reference genome were identified from University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser. The SNP data was merged with MS data and was used as reference for imputations. Out of all the animals 20% were used as validation while the rest were used as the reference animals. Beagle program [10] was used for determining the phase and imputation of the missing markers. Beagle uses Li and Stephens haplotype frequency models to performs imputation into phased haplotypes. Imputation method used by beagle is both computationally and memory efficient [11]. Beagle was used as it can handle both the bi-allelic and multi-allelic markers. First MS and SNP genotypes were phased independently and then the two types of datasets were merged and were phased again. This phased data was used as the reference for the imputations. A fivefold validation was performed to check the accuracy of imputation. Accuracy of imputation was measured by calculating the genotype concordance rate. Correlation between the true genotypes and the predicted genotypes were calculated. Accuracies were averaged over all five cross validation sets (Table 1). The allelic concordance, i.e., at least one of the allele was identified correctly, was also calculated. In addition, we compared if the numbers of iterations had any effect on the accuracy of the imputation. Accuracies of imputation were compared between two SNP panels.
