The rapid socioeconomic developments in developing countries have led to a shift in infrastructure, technology, and food supply, promoting overnutrition and sedentary lifestyles [1]. Consequently, the prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, has risen dramatically [2, 3]. In particular, Asian countries have experienced a notable increase in metabolic disease; thus, prevention and control of metabolic diseases should be the top public health priorities in Asian populations [3].
Glucose and insulin levels after overnight fasting are important indicators of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes [4]. Adiposity is believed modulate the genetic determinants of fasting glucose and insulin levels [5]. To identify genetic determinants that could be modified by body mass index (BMI), the interactions between genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and BMI with regard to fasting glucose and insulin levels were analyzed by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose- and Insulin-related traits Consortium (MAGIC) [6]. MAGIC identified several novel genetic variants: 7 SNPs (ARAP1, FOXA2, DPYSL5, PCSK1, PDX1, PPP1R3B, and OR4S1) for fasting glucose level and 6 SNPs (COBLL1-GRB14, IRS1, PPP1R3B, PDGFC, UHRF1BP1, and LYPLAL1) for fasting insulin level [6]. The MAGIC study comprised approximately 70,000 nondiabetic individuals of European ancestry, and its results should be confirmed in other ethnic groups [7].
Because no replication study has been performed in other ethnicities, we examined these SNPs and their association with fasting glucose and insulin levels and determined whether they are modified by obesity in the Korean population. The study design can be found in Fig. 1.
