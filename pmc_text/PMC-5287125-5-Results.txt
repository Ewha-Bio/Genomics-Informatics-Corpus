Clinical characteristics of NHL patients and treatment outcomes
The associations between clinical characteristics and OS or PFS are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The most common histologic type was DLBCL (n = 83); others included T-cell lymphoma (n = 18), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 6), and others (n = 5). Univariable results showed age, gender, performance status, extra-nodal involvement, and IPI as being significantly associated with OS and PFS in the total patient dataset, with p-values less than 0.05. Variables that were significant in the univariable results were used in the multivariable analysis. Using the backward variable selection method in the multivariable model, male, performance status 2, and extra-nodal involvement were highly associated with a poor prognosis for OS and PFS equally. In addition, age was also significantly associated with PFS. A subgroup analysis using DLBCL patients treated by R-CHOP showed a similar trend, except for age and performance status, as the multivariable result for PFS.
