Quality and quantity of the sequencing data
The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, including the mapping rate, genome coverage, scores of the mapping quality, and duplicate reads, are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, the mapping rate and scores of the mapping quality in the four pairs of primary PC and CRPC samples were higher than 95% and 53%, respectively. In addition, the average genome coverage of our samples was over 30× (between 31.81× and 53.54×). Although coverage of several hundred times is required for detecting low-level mutations in next-generation sequence data [13], WGS with 30× sequence coverage is appropriate for comprehensive identification of tumor-specific somatic mutations [14]. These results suggest that the quality and quantity of our sequencing data are adequate for mutational analysis during the progression from PC to CRPC.
