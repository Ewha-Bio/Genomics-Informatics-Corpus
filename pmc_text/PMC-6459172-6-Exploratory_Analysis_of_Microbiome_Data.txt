Ordination
The goal of ordination plots is the visualization of beta diversity for identification of possible data structures. The multidimensional data is represented into a reduced number of orthogonal axes while keeping the main trends of the data and preserving the distances among samples as much as possible. Most commonly used ordination methods for microbiome data are principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), also known as multidimensional scaling, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) [22,23].
PCoA an extension of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Given a distance or dissimilarity matrix, D, PCoA performs eigenvalue decomposition of Dc'Dc where Dc is the centered distance matrix. When D is the Euclidean distance, PCoA results exactly the same as PCA. Care must be taken with PCoA if the selected distance is not metric, because some eigenvalues may be negative and then, the graphical representation will not perform properly.
In order to avoid this problem NMDS is more commonly used. Also based on a distance matrix D, NMDS maximizes the rank-based correlation between the original distances and the distances between samples in the new reduced ordination space. The procedure starts with a random configuration and the optimal representation is obtained following an iterative procedure that at each steps improves the rank correlation.
Ordination plots can be obtained with the R and Bioconductor packages vegan and phyloseq, among others [13,19]. Alternatively, a CoDA ordination approach can be followed by performing PCA after the clr or ilr transformation as implemented by Le Cao et al. [24] in the context of the multivariate statistical framework mixMC.
