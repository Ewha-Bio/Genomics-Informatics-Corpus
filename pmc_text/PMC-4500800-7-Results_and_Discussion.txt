Protein structure prediction and validation
There are 158 amino acids in the protein sequence of HPV18 E6 protein. As the experimentally determined tertiary structure of E6 was not available, Phyre2 server was used to predict its three dimensional structure. During structure prediction, crystal structure of C chain of full-length HPV oncoprotein e62 in complex with lxxll peptide of ubiquitin ligase E6AP (PDB ID, 4GIZ) was taken as structural template by Phyre2 server. There was query coverage of 89% and identities of 57% observed between target-template alignment. Upon structural refinement of predicted structure by YASARA Energy Minimization Server, the total energy of refined structure was observed to be -19,732.64 kcal/mol (score, 0.07), whereas it was as 166,485.03 kcal/mol (score, -0.55) prior to energy minimization.
Upon Procheck analysis, 99.2% residues of the refined model (Fig. 2A) were found in most favourable region and additional allowed regions and only 0.8% (Ser59) residue in situated generously allowed region, whereas not a single residue observed in the disallowed region of Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2B). The compatible Z score (Fig. 2C) value was observed to be -4.46 by ProSA-web evaluation, which is quite well within the native conformations range of crystal structures [31]. The residue energy of the refined model were observed to be largely negative (Fig. 2D). The Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool predict the LG score of 2.205 for HPV18 E6 protein model, implying high precision of the modeled structure as ProQ LG score of more than 1.5 is essential for signifying that a predicted structure is of fairly good quality [33]. The overall quality factor is predicted to be 91% by the ERRAT plot (Fig. 2E) showing the well accuracy of predicted structure. Overall, based on the above results, the reliability of the predicted model was suggested.
