Cardio-renal syndrome
Cardio-renal syndrome is a combined disorder having both heart and kidney dysfunction. The primary failed organ can be either the heart or kidney, and in both cases, the one that is diseased earlier impairs the other one, and finally, they negatively affect each other [37]. One of the suggested mechanisms making these two organs negatively interact with each other is mediated by AGEs [39]. Accumulation of AGEs is commonly observed in patients with both heart failure and renal disorders [40, 41]. With heart failure, increase of AGEs leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and delayed calcium uptake, which subsequently result in diastolic dysfunction. In addition, accumulation of AGEs in renal dysfunction is negatively affected by highly activated inflammation and fibrosis, and further damage of kidney structure impairs its own function of AGE clearance [39]. Symptoms of the disease might be enhanced by this vicious cycle, as well as with other multifactorial signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis.
