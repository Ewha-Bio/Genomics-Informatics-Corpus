A total of 8,842 subjects (4,183 men and 4,659 women) were involved in the study. Of them, 3,253 (36.8%) had MetS. Clinical characteristics of subjects with and without MetS are shown in Table 1. Individuals with MetS were older, with higher BMI, systolic BP, triglycerides, and fasting plasma glucose and lower HDL-cholesterol levels compared to subjects without MetS.
In the discovery set of the GWAS, three SNPs associated with MetS were identified, demonstrated in Table 2. SNPs from chromosome 12, including rs11066280, rs2074356, and rs12229654, had a p < 5 × 10-6. From these SNPs, only rs11066280 satisfied the Bonferroni-corrected cutoff (unadjusted p < 1.38 × 10-7, Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.05).
The top 10 significant biological pathways or gene sets associated with MetS at the 75th percentile cutoff are shown in Table 3. The pathways were as follows: electron carrier activity (gene ontology [GO] term), signaling by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (Reactome), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) cascade (GO term), PDGF binding (GO term), nucleic acid binding (protein analysis through evolutionary relationships [PANTHER] molecular function), PPAR signaling (Ingenuity), negative regulation of gene-specific transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter (GO term), non-motor microtubule-binding protein (PANTHER molecular function), protein secretion (GO term), and DNA repair (GO term). At the FDR level, although all pathways were above 0.05, the pathway of electron carrier activity had an FDR value < 0.1, and the pathways of signaling by PDGF and PPAR signaling showed an FDR < 0.2.
