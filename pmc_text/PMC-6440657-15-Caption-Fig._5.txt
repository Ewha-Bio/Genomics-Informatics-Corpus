Silymarin is produced via the oxidative coupling of two major precursors, namely, taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol. The figure represents the formation of coniferyl alcohol and taxifolin via the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, respectively. The number in the boxes represents the enzyme as code per the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification, and the details are provided in Supplementary Table 2. The coloured boxes represent the enzymes that were found in our transcriptome data.
