Conserved signature proteins
The most common biomarker proteins were distinguished by comparing BLASTX results for all reference strains fragments (Table 2). The signature proteins identified included: CDT, holin, lambda-family proteins, nuclease, phage integrase family proteins, phage tail tape measure family proteins, putative membrane proteins, regulatory proteins, restriction-modification system proteins, tail fiber assembly proteins, baseplate assembly proteins, tail fiber protein and other prophage tail related proteins, terminuses and transferases. The nucleotide sequences of some proteins including anti-termination proteins, prophage DNA packaging and binding proteins, transposase and DNA transposition proteins, scaffold proteins, recombination-related domains, putative phage-replication proteins, hemolysin, helicase, glycol transferase, and glycohydrolase superfamilies, were detected as biomarkers in the target group, although these BLASTX results were not observed in all reference strains. Presumably, CDT-producer E. coli strains possess several hypothetical proteins whose functions are not yet defined and might be conserved proteins. The existence of these DNA biomarker sequences in reference strains is clear; however, the related proteins in some strains have not been determined.
