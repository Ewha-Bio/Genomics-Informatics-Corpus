Averaged true positive rates of principal component analysis (PCA), Hotelling's T2 test, permutation test, and group lasso are displayed along with a different number of selected genes when the number of causal genetic sites (N) among 10 sites in a gene is 2, 5, or 10, and the standard deviation of an error terms (Ïƒ) to control a noise level is 1.5, 2, or 2.5.
