The human LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p22 and includes 10 exons encoding 475 amino acids, of which 448 amino acids are part of the mature protein and 27 of the signal peptide [19, 20]. LPL has an essential role in the metabolism of lipids, as it hydrolyzes a number of substrates, such as long- and short-chain glycerides and phospholipids in vitro, as well as major substrates, such as CMs and VLDL in vivo [21]. Dysfunction of LPL has been reported to be associated with chylomicronemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease, and dyslipidemia [22].
Genetic association studies have shown that some SNPs located in the LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region, are strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels, mostly in Europeans. Specifically, by performing meta-analyses of genomewide association studies, Aulchenko et al. [13] found that rs2083637 and rs10096633 were associated with HDLC and TG levels, and it was also demonstrated that rs325 and rs10105606, reported by Waterworth et al. [11], and rs12678919, reported by Kathiresan et al. [23], were associated with HDLC and TG levels. Studies using the candidate gene approach, which examines the effects of genetic variants of a putative gene in an association, have reported that some LPL SNPs are associated with HDLC and TG levels. Tang et al. [24] recently revealed that rs326 and rs328 (which convert serine to a stop codon) and rs13702 are associated with HDLC and TG levels in African-Americans and European-American populations.
Here, rs263 and rs271, located, respectively, in introns 5 and 6, were strongly associated with increased HDLC and decreased TG levels (Table 2). The two significant SNPs formed an HT block with strong LD (r2 = 0.99) in stage 1, and rs3200218, located in the 3' UTR, formed another HT block with 15 SNPs located in the 3' flanking region. At stage 2, nine SNPs in the LPL gene remained after SNP filtering, out of which six were significantly associated with HDLC levels (Supplementary Table 2). SNPs rs343, rs253, rs263, and rs271, located, respectively, in introns 3, 4, 5, and 6, formed an HT block with moderate LD (r2 > 0.3). SNPs rs326, rs327, rs12679834, rs11570892n, and rs3200218 formed another HT block with 31 SNPs located in the 3' flanking region. In the two blocks at stages 1 and 2, some HTs were found to be strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The analysis using the combined data from both stages showed that HTs were also significantly associated with HDLC and TG levels (Table 3). Using the imputation data, we found that more LPL SNPs were included in the two blocks. HTs that were significantly associated with lipid profiles were also identified (Supplementary Table 3).
The strongest association of HT with HDLC and TG levels was observed in block 2 (from both stages). A previous study reported that one HT was associated with increased LPL activity [25]. The HT was found to be consistent with HT3 in block 2, found using stage 1 and imputed data, which was associated here with increased HDLC and decreased TG levels. In block 2, we found that one SNP, rs328, which converts serine to a stop codon, was included using imputed data. Interestingly, the minor allele G of rs328 was found only in HT3. It has been reported that this minor allele is associated with increased HDLC and decreased TG concentrations in Japanese [26] and European populations [10, 27], and our results support this finding. This truncated variant was also demonstrated to have higher catalytic activity [28-30].
SNP rs328 has been reported to be in strong LD with rs17482753 in European (r2 = 1) and African (r2 = 0.852) populations [31]. rs17482753 was genotyped in stage 1 and 2 of this study, and the SNP was found to be in strong LD with rs328, according to the imputed data (r2 = 0.993). We additionally identified strong LD (r2 = 0.93) between rs328 and rs17482753 by using genotype data of 830 Korean participants obtained from a previous study [32], in which samples in stage 1 of this study were included. Similar to the results of rs328 obtained using the imputed data in this study, the rs17482753 minor allele was found to be strongly associated with raised HDLC and reduced TG levels in a dominant manner at both stages.
In a previous study, LPL SNPs located in the 3' UTR region were considered possible targets affecting miRNA binding sites, and 5 SNPs were predicted to be putative miRNA binding sites by polymiRTS [33]. The 3' UTR region of the LPL gene was included in block 2 in this study, and two of the predicted 5 SNPs were tested (Supplementary Table 1). Rs1059611 major allele T from the imputed data was significantly associated with reduced levels of HDLC and LDLC and with increased TG levels in an additive manner. In this SNP, the major T allele was predicted to create a new miRNA (miR-136) binding site, causing abnormal repression of this gene. The major allele of another SNP, rs11570892, was predicted to disrupt a conserved miRNA (miR-592) binding site, and this could cause abnormal control of normal repression. However, this SNP showed inconsistent association with LDLC levels in stages 1 and 2 of this study.
Some environmental factors have been suggested to be associated with lipid profiles. Physical activity was reported to be associated with higher HDLC and lower TG and TCHL concentrations [34], whereas smoking was reported to be associated with higher LDLC and TG and lower HDLC levels [35, 36]. Alcohol consumption was suggested to be associated with increased HDLC levels [37, 38], whereas excessive alcohol consumption was associated with a higher TG level [39]. A low fat intake, in turn, was associated with reduced TCHL, LDLC, and HDLC and increased TG levels [40]. Some LPL SNPs have also been shown to be associated with lipid profiles through their interaction with smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Specifically, rs320 has been suggested to interact with smoking [41, 42] and physical activity [42], and rs1801177 interacts with physical activity [43]. The SNP rs328, which is a nonsense SNP included in our imputed data, has been associated with HDL through its interaction with smoking and alcohol consumption in females but not in males [44]. In a recent study, however, the interaction of several LPL SNPs, including rs328, with alcohol consumption was suggested to have no influence on HDLC levels [45].
In this study, we show that the effects of some LPL polymorphisms on lipid concentrations were regulated by several environmental factors. Carriers of each minor allele of 3 SNPs (rs263, rs271, and rs328) were associated with slightly higher HDLC levels, depending on an interaction with energy intake. This effect, however, was not observed among non-carriers (Supplementary Fig. 3). In two of these SNPs (rs263 and rs271), which were in strong LD (r2 = 0.99 in stages 1 and 2), each major genotype carrier led to higher levels of TG, whereas the TG levels of each minor allele carrier were not affected by a higher energy intake. Carriers of each minor allele, but not non-carriers, led to a higher HDLC level through an interaction with a higher intake of fat (Fig. 1). Each major genotype carrier of two SNPs (rs263 and rs271) showed lower HDLC levels and higher TG levels than minor allele carriers through an interaction with smoking (Fig. 2). In the major genotype carrier of these two SNPs, higher TG levels were also found by interacting with alcohol consumption (Supplementary Fig. 4), whereas each minor allele carrier was less affected than non-carriers by smoking or alcohol consumption.
For interactions of HTs, blocks 1 and 2 were shown to interact with inconsistent lifestyle variables. Interaction effects of HT1 and 2 in block 1 with lifestyle factors, which were formed by the two SNPs, on lipid levels were almost same with those of rs263 and rs271 (data not shown). In the LPL gene, 61 missense mutations have been identified, and interestingly, 42 of them are located in exons 5 and 6, which may be contained in block 1 [46]. Carrier of HT3 in block 2, which was reported to be associated with increased LPL activity [25], showed higher HDLC levels and lower TG levels, whereas non-carriers were not affected by a higher energy intake (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). In the non-carrier of HT4 in block 2, higher TG levels were found by interacting with cigarette smoking (Supplementary Fig. 4). Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption were reported to be related with reduced and increased LPL activity, respectively [47, 48], but the precise mechanisms by which the interaction of LPL polymorphisms with environmental factors affects lipid concentrations have not been demonstrated yet.
In conclusion, we found that HTs are strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels in the 2 blocks in which LPL SNPs are included and that SNPs in these blocks are also strongly associated with HDLC and TG levels in stage 1. Interestingly, these results were replicated in stage 2, which consists of independent samples, and the combined analyses, including the samples of stages 1 and 2, showed the most significant results. Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the interaction of LPL polymorphisms with several lifestyle factors on plasma lipid levels, we have shown that the effects of some LPL SNPs and HTs on HDLC and TG concentrations are regulated by energy and fat intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Since these results have not been reported in any previous studies, they are novel findings. These interaction effects suggest that the appropriate lifestyle of each individual could be recommended according to the type of LPL polymorphism. These results should be confirmed in other populations and in a longitudinal study.
