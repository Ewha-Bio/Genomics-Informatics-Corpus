Structure prediction and refinement of proposed drug target
Due to absence of experimental structure the tertiary model of lpxD (UniProt ID: A9INS9) protein was predicted by the single highest scoring template i.e., lpxD protein of P. aeruginosa (PDB ID: 3PMO, chain A) using phyre2 [35] web server with 100% confidence. Protein attains the lowest free energy during the native state; therefore the stability of the predicted model was improved through energy minimization [36] procedure, supported by the Root Mean Square Deviation score 0.612 obtained through the structural superimposition of lpxD models both before and after energy minimization (Fig. 5B). The refined lpxD protein model is publically available in Protein Model Database with PMDB ID (PM0080538).
