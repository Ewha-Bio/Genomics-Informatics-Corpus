Selection of gender-specific DNA methylation and gene expression markers
The gender-specific DNA methylation markers of the X chromosome were selected from reported X-linked housekeeping genes [9]. The gender-specific DNA methylation markers of the Y chromosome were estimated using differentially methylated CpG sites in Y chromosomes between males and females (Supplementary Fig. 1). Gender-specific markers were selected based on their beta value distribution in both males and females. As a result, two markers (cg24139739 and cg02869694) were selected as X chromosome markers, and two markers (cg07851521 and cg10835413) were selected as Y chromosome markers. The cutoff values for each marker were cg24139739 < 0.25, cg02869694 < 0.4, cg07851521 > 0.5, and cg10835413 > 0.45 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The gender-specific gene expression markers were selected from reported gender-specific gene expression patterns in human blood (Supplementary Fig. 2) in a similar way [10]. Two markers (214218_s_at and 224588_at) were selected as X chromosome markers, and two markers (204409_s_at and 205000_at) were selected as Y chromosome markers. The cutoff values for each marker were 214218_s_at < 4.5, 224588_at < 7.5, 204409_s_at > 5, and 205000_at > 5.
