Data analysis
Using the Ion Torrent Suite v5.2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for Ion S5, we analyzed raw data and performed alignment of the sequencing reads to the reference genome (Human Genome build 19). The coverage analysis was performed using the Ion Torrent Coverage analysis plug-in software v5.2.1.2, and variants were detected using the Variant Caller plug-in v5.2.2.41 with low-stringency settings. We also used ANNOVAR, which is a tool that annotates called variants, querying a knowledge database with various clinical information. We used in-out pipelines to filter mouse contamination, with reference to a database of SNPs and another study [11]. The variant calls were examined manually with the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) from the Broad Institute [12, 13], and we identified somatic mutations using the COSMIC database and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The mutations were filtered with matched normal data to reduce false positives. To define copy number alterations (CNAs), we used NEXUS software 9.0 (Biodiscovery, El Segundo, CA, USA) [1, 14].
