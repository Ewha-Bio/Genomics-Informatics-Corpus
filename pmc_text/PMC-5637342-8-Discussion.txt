We have developed MergeReference, a software package that provides a streamlined pipeline for combining multiple reference panels into one for HLA imputation. In a previous study, Kim et al. [13] also evaluated the gain in performance of merging reference panels for HLA imputation, although they did not provide a software pipeline. Similar to our work, their results supported the utility of merging panels, particularly when the ethnicities are similar. However, merging Asian panels with a European panel did not provide better performance for imputing HLA in Asian samples [13]. Therefore, determining whether merging multiple panels increases the accuracy depends on how similar the ethnicities of the panels are. If it is unclear whether merging panels would help or not, it can be good practice to evaluate the approximate accuracy by using a public dataset, such as HapMap, or setting aside a subset of the panel samples as a test dataset. Another issue that can affect the performance of the merged panel is the sample size balance. We found that if one panel is much larger (e.g., by 10-fold) than the other panel, the merged panel often has essentially the same performance as the single large panel. In such situations, subsampling from the large panel may improve the balance of the two panels, despite the decreased sample size. Further investigations will be needed to thoroughly explore these issues related to the gain in performance with merging, and we expect that our software pipeline will facilitate such explorations in future studies.
