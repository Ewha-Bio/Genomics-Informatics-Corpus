OAuth 2.0-based authorization model
In this study, the IUA guideline [5] and OAuth 2.0 [6] are used to design and realize IABio. Researchers should obtain access authorization to use IABio and the concerned data. The server manager who controls the authorization server should not have access to the database in which patient information is saved. Therefore, the IABio server should be physically separated from the authorization server and provide only authorization and authority. This kind of environment is suitable for the IUA guideline. In this study, the authorization method uses the OAuth 2.0-based ROPCG method and is designed in a communication diagram, as in Fig. 4.
Our study proposes an authorization method based on the 2-step access authorization of IABio, along with resource owner server (web portal) authorization. Each researcher (client) should be assigned an authorization token from the authorization server to get access to the portal. After obtaining the authorization token, the researcher has access to the portal and proceeds with the first authorization. Next, the researcher gets the second authorization in IABio to use the service. Because security authorization is strictly designed in double walls, it can avoid weaknesses to phishing scams and impersonation attacks.
The first step of the authorization procedure is to check if it is possible to identify users' personal information. The second authorization step proceeds with authorization for database access one more time.
Our study uses this 2-step authorization in designing and developing IABio.
