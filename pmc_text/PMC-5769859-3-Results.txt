HOTAIR gene is transcribed into different RNA isoforms by alternative compositional features
According to the Ace view database, 11 distinct GT-AG introns are identified in the HOTAIR gene. This results in seven different transcripts, six of which are created through alternative splicing (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/). Different variants were found in GENECODE V22 and Ensembl. According to the Refseq, there are three transcript variants for this gene (NR_047518.1, NR_047517.1 and NR_003716.3) (Fig. 2).
Since it seems that alternative transcripts of HOTAIR are due to alternative promoters, TSSs, alternative polyadenylation sites, and alternative splicing, we tried to find different promoters, TSSs, polyadenylation, and splice sites in the HOTAIR gene.
We found alternative promoters and polyadenylation sites in the HOTAIR locus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/research/acembly/). According to the Ensembl, there are two active promoters in this gene (Fig. 3). Also, Chromatin state segmentation using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [27] identified these two active promoters as well as enhancers in the HOTAIR gene in some cell lines. The HMM is a probabilistic model representing probability distributions over sequences of observations. Supplementary Table 1 which is based on UCSC hg19, shows the positions of the active promoters of HOTAIR locus in Ensemble and HMM.
Promoter prediction with different tools recognized alternative promoters throughout this gene. Promoter scan program was run with the default promoter cutoff score. This program predicts promoters based on the degree of homologies with eukaryotic RNA pol II promoter sequences (https://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan/) [28]. Different TSSs were also found in the HOTAIR gene by different programs and software including Eponine, Switchgear, and Promoter 2 [29]. The Eponine program provides a probabilistic method for detecting TSSs. The Switchgear algorithm uses a scoring metric based largely on existing transcript evidence. Promoter2 takes advantage of a combination of principles that are common to neural networks and genetic algorithms. The positions of found TSSs compared to other features are shown in the Supplementary Table 1.
