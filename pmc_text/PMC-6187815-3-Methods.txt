Preparation of DNA gyrase protein structure for molecular docking
Prior to molecular docking, the topoisomerase II DNA gyrase protein was prepared to remove water molecules and unwanted ligands. All water molecules and small ions except the zinc ions were removed using the protein preparation wizard on the WHATIF web interface. Subsequently, hydrogen atoms were added to the structure to correct the tautomeric and oxidation states of amino acids residues.
