We recruited a total of 592 subjects, which consisted of 163 AERD cases and 429 ATA controls, for the present study. According to the results, four clinical characteristics showed significant differences between the case and control groups (Table 1). The fall rate by aspirin provocation was significantly higher in AERD subjects than ATA controls (24.63 ± 16.11 vs. 3.54 ± 4.85; p = 0.0001). Percentage of predicted FEV1 in the AERD subjects showed decreased lung function than in ATA subjects (87.58 ± 16.94 vs. 91.66 ± 16.87; p = 0.009). Also, age of first medical examination and BMI were lower in AERD cases than ATA controls. The other diagnostic factors showed no significant differences between the case and control group.
In the present study, 38 TEC polymorphisms and 12 major haplotypes were used for the association analyses. Locations of the polymorphisms are shown in a genetic map of TEC with their LD status (Fig. 1A). Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of the SNPs in Korean subjects are displayed in Supplementary Table 2 with their allele change, position, and p-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. All SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The LD blocks were obtained by using HaploView software, and the haplotypes of each LD block were calculated by PHASE software (Fig. 1B and 1C). We used major haplotypes that had frequencies higher than 0.05 for further analyses. The minor haplotypes that had frequencies lower than 0.05 were merged and presented as 'Others.' To compare genetic differences among ethnicities, we obtained MAFs of Caucasians, Han Chinese, Japanese, and Africans from the NCBI database (dbSNP) (Supplementary Table 2) and calculated LD blocks using genotype data from the International HapMap database (Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result, Asian populations showed similar MAFs, whereas the other populations showed distinct differences. However, we did not find any correlation in LD status in any ethnicity.
Logistic analyses were performed to investigate the associations between TEC polymorphisms and the risk of AERD. The result from analyses revealed that all SNPs and major haplotypes were not associated with the risk of AERD (Table 2). On the other hand, two SNPs (rs7664091, p = 0.04 and rs12500534, p = 0.03) and one major haplotype in LD block 2 (TEC_BL2_ht4, p = 0.03) showed marginal associations in the regression analysis with the decline rate of FEV1 (Supplementary Table 3). However, the association signals of these polymorphisms disappeared after performing corrections for multiple testing (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the TEC polymorphisms are not associated with AERD susceptibility, at least in the Korean population. The lack of associations in this study suggests that although TEC plays an important role in immune responses, TEC variants do not directly affect decreased pulmonary function by aspirin uptake. However, considering the fact that the difference in frequency of polymorphisms showed different effects in various populations, replication studies in AERD subjects in other ethnicities are recommended.
The present study still had several limitations. First, an average statistical power of 66.41% indicated an insufficient sample size. However, the rare condition of AERD made it difficult to recruit subjects in the Korean asthma cohort. Second, SNPs in coding sequence were not selected, due to very low frequencies, although non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNP) in exonic regions could affect risk of the disease. Further studies are required to examine the molecular role of nsSNPs in TEC.
In conclusion, we hypothesized that TEC might impact on AERD susceptibility. However, our results showed that 38 TEC polymorphisms and 12 major haplotypes were not associated with the risk of AERD. Although further studies are required to investigate the exact role of the TEC SNPs in immune responses, the preliminary results of the present study may provide useful information for AERD pathogenesis.
