Cancer is an uncontrolled state and irregularly altered genetically and epigenetically compared to normal regulation (Fig. 2). For this reason, many studies have made an effort to identify specific features and regulation mechanims of various diseases, including cancer. It is important and necessary to identify cancer markers to be able to distinguish between cancer and normal cells. Cancer markers could be very helpful in understanding tumorigenesis and developing tumor targets for therapeutic intervention. However, there still remain unsolved problems in spite of a number of studies [7, 14, 45, 64]. From this point of view, alternatively spliced transcripts by mutation and cryptic splice site altered expression levels in cancer have emerged as strong candidates of cancer biomarker at the mRNA and protein level [7]. As written previously, some alternative transcripts of several genes, CD44, p53, PTEN, BCL-X, VEGF4, and MDM2, have been discovered (see also Table 1) [43, 46, 49, 50, 52, 54]. They are also associated with various cancers directly or indirectly. Recently, the discovery of biomarkers has improved by genomewide analysis [13, 65, 66]. It could be expected to provide valuable information for the association between alternative splice variants and cancers. Thus, novel candidate variants could contribute to the development of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers.
