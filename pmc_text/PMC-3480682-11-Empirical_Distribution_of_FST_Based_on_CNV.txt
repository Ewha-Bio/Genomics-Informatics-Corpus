Outliers detected by BayeScan
BayeScan identified the three outlier CNVs with Conrad et al.'s [4] CNV data (Table 1, Fig. 2). The most decisive outlier is CNVR2664.1 (chromosome 5), in which most CEU (90%) and all CHB + JPT populations are outlying gain or loss status. The next decisive outlier is CNVR371.1 (chr. 1), in which only the YRI population has non-neutral CNVs.
