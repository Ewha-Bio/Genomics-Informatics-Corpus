Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing is a method of marketing genetic tests to consumers without the direct involvement of a health care provider [1]. DTC genetic testing in Korea has been introduced since 2017 by the amendment of the Bioethics and safety Act. Through the amendment, 12 phenotypes by 46 genes have been allowed for DTC genetic testing. Those phenotypes include traits of body mass index, cholesterol, blood pressure and so on [2]. Recently, the Korean government introduced a regulatory sandbox that includes DTC genetic tests [3]. Several genetic testing companies received approval for predictive DTC genetic tests for conditions ranging from cancer to chronic diseases. And also, the ministry of Health and Welfare is doing the pilot program of the expanded DTC genetic testing [4]. DTC genetic testing has a lot of issues from accuracies to ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI). I raise the immediate issues relevant to DTC briefly.
