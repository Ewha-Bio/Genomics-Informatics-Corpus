Transcriptome reconstruction is the identification of all transcripts expressed in a specimen. There are two strategies used for transcriptome reconstruction, including the reference-guided approach and the reference-independent approach. First, the reference-guided approach consists of two sequential steps: (1) alignment of raw reads to the reference as described in the previous section and (2) assembly of overlapping reads for reconstructing transcripts. This approach is advantageous when reference annotation information is well-known, such as in human and mouse, which is employed in Cufflinks [24], Scripture [25], and StringTie [26]. Second, the reference-independent approach uses a de novo assembly algorithm to directly build consensus transcripts from short reads without reference, which is useful when there is no known reference genome or transcriptome. Trinity [27], Oases [28], and transABySS [29] may be used for this purpose.
Two publications have described RNA-seq protocols: one is de novo transcriptome reconstruction without reference using the Trinity platform [30] and the other is differential expression analysis of a gene and transcript using a combination of TopHat and Cufflinks [31]. The latter protocol also includes a transcriptome reconstruction procedure (using Cufflinks) from read mapping data to a reference genome (using TopHat). These protocols are good examples of different strategies that can be used for transcriptome reconstruction according to the presence or absence of a reference sequence.
