Sequencing and de novo assembly of the transcriptomes
Sequencing summaries and de novo assembly of the transcriptome results are presented in Supplementary Table 2â€“4. We obtained over 10 Gbp raw data from leaf samples of 0B and 1B plants. For de novo sequence assembly, quality trimming of raw reads for 83.76% in 0B and 81.69% in 1B plant samples resulted in 77,087 genes and 154,810 transcripts with an average length 791 bp. It was estimated that approximately 99% of the reads were mapped to de novo transcripts. All sequence reads have been deposited in NCBI Sequence Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The BioProject and SRA accessions are PRJNA509487, SRR8316493, and SRR8316494, respectively.
