Model evaluation of proposed drug target
The correctness and quality of predicted lpxD protein model of B. petrii was verified through RAMPAGE [37], ProSA-web [38], ProQ [39], and ERRAT [40] online server. The RAMPAGE analysis revealed 99.5% residues were folded properly suggesting good backbone folding pattern (Fig. 5C). Further, Z-score for lpxD model calculated by ProSA-web to be â€“6.84 (Fig. 5D) which is well within the range of native conformation of experimental structures. Furthermore, ProQ computed a Levitt-Gerstein (LG) score of 2.785 and Max sub score to be 0.225 for the predicted model. A ProQ LG score >2.5 is necessary for suggesting a model is of good quality [39], implying high accuracy level of predicted structure. Also, the overall quality factor for lpxD model of B. petrii was predicted as 73.23% (Fig. 5E) by ERRAT web server. All of these evaluations recommended the reliability of the predicted lpxD model of B. petrii.
