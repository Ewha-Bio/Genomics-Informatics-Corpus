Data
The KARE data were generated and kindly provided through a grant program by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data consisted of a total of 8,842 individuals: 4,637 from Ansan (an urban area) and 4,205 from Anseong (a rural area) in Gyeonggi province. There were 32 groups depending on ages from 39 to 70, and the numbers of individuals in each of the 32 groups were: 21, 421, 469, 489, 485, 473, 426, 400, 368, 291, 325, 268, 215, 207, 241, 242, 259, 197, 225, 238, 231, 255, 239, 230, 232, 254, 270, 210, 254, 200, 194, and 13, respectively. Because there were small numbers of individuals for the ages of 39 and 70, they were combined with the age groups of 40 and 69, respectively. Therefore, the total number of age groups was 30. It is neither necessary nor efficient to use all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), because estimating Ne does not require many variants. Only 10,000 SNPs or 1,000 pairs of SNPs were enough to estimate the correct Ne in the simulations of previous studies [13, 14]. In the simulation studies, the variances were least biased for the most frequent variants. Therefore, the same as in previous studies [13, 14], SNPs with minor allele frequencies higher than 0.4 and without missing genotypes were used for the analyses. The estimates of LD were the r2 estimates-i.e., the squared correlation coefficient between two variants.
