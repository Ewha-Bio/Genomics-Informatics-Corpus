Construction of prediction models and validation in testing datasets
We fitted the prediction models using SLR, LASSO, and EN using the entire training individuals in the KARE cohort. Then, we applied the prediction models to the KARE testing dataset and an external replication dataset. The prediction models were built based on Affymetrix 5.0, but the external replication dataset was generated by Affymetrix 6.0. In the case of the KARE dataset, nearly 90% of the SNPs belonged to the external replication dataset. Thus, we did not include untyped SNPs in the evaluation of prediction models using the replication dataset. Among the five SNP sets, Fig. 3 shows that the prediction models from the KARE SNP set had higher AUC values for the KARE testing dataset than other SNP sets. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4, the prediction models from ALL + KARE had the best performance overall for the external replication dataset. In Table 4, the best combinations of the variable selection and prediction models had the highest AUC values. SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN with three set from KARE had an AUC of 0.816 in the KARE testing dataset. In an external replication dataset, SLR-SLR and SLR-EN with one set from ALL + KARE (AUC, 0.726) were the best, with 51 SNPs for T2D, while SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN with three set from KARE (AUC, 0.590) showed the best performance, with 53 SNPs. SLR-SLR with one set from ALL + KARE was superior to the model with only demographic variables (15.7% increase in AUC). Among the 51 SNPs of SLR-SLR with one set from ALL + KARE, 38 SNPs were mapped to the genes (Table 5). Some genes (AGR3, C2CD4B, C6orf57, CAMK1D, DNER, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, NXN, PLS1, and RGS7) were previously reported to be associated with T2D [44454647484950515253].
