Haplotype phasing by fastPHASE
Phasing is needed to determine which variants are inherited by an individual at each locus and to more accurately determine the relationships between unrelated individuals in large population datasets. Using phasing population data, we can identify haplotypes, which are essentially segments of DNA that are common to a particular ethnic group. The fastPHASE program version 1.1.4 [13] was used to estimate missing genotypes and reconstruct haplotypes from unphased SNP genotype data of unrelated individuals in order to identify ethnicity-specific SNPs.
