Concordance of variant detection
To check the concordance of the detected variants, Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. NGS reactions were performed with the OncoChase-AS panel in triplicated runs. We annotated the variants using the ANNOVAR program [11]. The criteria for variant calling were as follows: exonic variants detected in more than 5% in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Project for East Asian and variants with >3% mutant allele frequency (MAF) [15, 16].
