GC3
Highly expressed gene uses a set of optimal codons. These codons are biased to pyrimidines (i.e., C and T) ending at the third position. Shields [31] found that GC contents at silent sites were often correlated with gene expression. The base composition at silent sites measures the GC content at the third position of synonymous codons (GC3s) and can be used as an index of codon bias. It is the frequency of G or C nucleotides present at the third position of codons except non-degenerate codons (i.e., Met, Trp, and stop codons) GC3=∑(NNS)∈CfNNS∑(NNN)∈CfNNN, where N = any base, S = G or C. and fxyz is the observed frequency of codon xyz.
