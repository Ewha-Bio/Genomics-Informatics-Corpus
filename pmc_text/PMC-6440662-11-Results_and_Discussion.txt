Transport
In our findings, we report the prediction of HP WP_000070107.1 to be a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, largest of all protein families with a diversity of physiological functions [84]. It has recently been identified that these proteins may be involved in virulence and are essential for intracellular survival of pathogens [85]. We have found protein WP_001296791.1 to be an auto-transporter of the YhjY type involved in DNA repair [86]. Protein WP_001238362.1 has been found to exhibit the function of transport of nutrients, control of cell regulation, pheromone transport, cryptic coloration and in the enzymatic synthesis of prostaglandins. An example a protein with such function is the retinol-binding protein 4, which transfers retinol from liver to peripheral tissues [87].
