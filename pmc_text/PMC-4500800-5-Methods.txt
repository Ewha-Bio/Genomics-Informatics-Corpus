Ligand preparation and protein-ligand docking
Chemical structures along with Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number of 12 natural compounds reported in literature (Fig. 1) (artemisinin, WA, ursolic acid, ferulic acid, EGCG, berberin, resveratrol, jaceosidin, curcumin, gingerol, indol-3-carbinol, and silymarin), were retrieved from PubChem database (Table 1) [35]. Receptor molecules (HPV18 E6) was prepared in AutoDock 4.2 program [36] and docking studies were performed as per the standard methodology for protein-ligand docking used by Kumar et al. [37].
