Primacy sequence analysis
We received the fastq files of whole-exome sequencing results of tumor and matched normal sample data of 10 AML patients from the Korea Genome Organization in December 2012. There were no patient-related medical or characteristic data. We aligned the sequencing reads to the human reference genome (hg 19, GRCh37) from USCC by BWA 0.6.2 [12] (Figs. 1 and 2). To filter the known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used dbSNP bulid 137. We removed PCR duplicates and filtering low-quality SNPs by Samtools 0.1.18 [13], Picard 1.68 [14], and GATK 2.3.4 [15]. After the filtering process, the SAM file was converted to VCF file by VCF Tools 0.1.10 [16]. For detecting somatic mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool [17].
