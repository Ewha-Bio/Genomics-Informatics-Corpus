CpG islands were found to be overlapped with active promoters and DNase I hypersensitivity sites
According to the UCSC browser, bona fide CpGIs, Weizmann Evolutionary, and CpG ProD program, there were different CpG Islands (CGIs) in the HOTAIR gene. These CpGIs are shown in the Fig. 4. UCSC genome browser identifies CGIs of human genome based on the regions of DNA with average (G+C) content greater than 50%, length greater than 200 bp and a moving average CpG O/E greater than 0.6 [30, 31]. “Bona fide” identifies functional CpGIs by linking genetic and epigenetic information [32]. Weizmann evolutionary (WE) predicts highly conserved CGIs through their classification of evolutionary dynamics (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) [33]. “CpG ProD” program identifies CpGIs-overlapping with promoters in the large genomic regions under analysis and shows these CpGIs with length longer than other CpGIs [34]. Then, we tried to find any overlap between CpGIs and other regulatory elements. Two TSSs (CHR-12-P0397-R1, CHR12-P0397-R2) were found within CpG165 (annotated in UCSC genome browser) and 1437 (derived from bona fide CGIs). The CpGIs were mostly overlapped with the active promoter regions (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). We focused on CpG165 and found some regulatory elements which are within or near to this CpG (Table 2).
In addition, several DNase I hypersensitivity hotspots were found to be overlapped with CpGIs in some cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). We found the DNase I hypersensitivity peak clusters of HOTAIR gene in 95 cells with score greater than 0.6 by using UCSC genome browser. DNase I hypersensitivity peak cluster 19 is located within CpG1433 and mostly overlaps with CpG18. Also, DNase I hypersensitivity peak cluster 41 is located within CpG1437 and mostly overlaps with CpG165 and partially overlaps with CpG2 (WE) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1).
Furthermore, we detected specific CpG dinucleotides methylation status within or near the predicted CpGIs in some cell lines by using ENCODE (Supplementary Table 2). This track identifies specific CpG dinucleotides methylation status by Infinium human methylation 450 bead array platform and classifies the methylation status into four groups: (1) not available (score = 0), (2) unmethylated (0 < score ≤ 200), (3) partially methylated (200 < score < 600), and (4) methylated (score ≥ 600) (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).
