SNP-SNP relationship matrix
Supplementary Table 2 shows the calculated 1-8th SNP components of the Gu square matrix obtained using the SMW lemma. The variance components (diagonal parts) were the values close to 1. It suggests that the Gu matrix can be interpreted as the SNP-SNP relationship matrix. The covariance components can be interpreted as the SNP-SNP relationships or, in other words, SNP-SNP interaction terms, because the variance components represent the SNPs' relationships themselves.
