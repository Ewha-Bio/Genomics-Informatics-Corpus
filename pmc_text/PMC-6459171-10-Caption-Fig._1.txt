Relative mRNA expression levels of transcription factors in the mouse lung type II transcriptome. (A) The mRNA levels of activator protein (AP1), activation transcription factor (ATF), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and nuclear hormone receptors (NR) family members involved in inflammatory response. (B) The mRNA levels of Mt, Cebp, Klf, and Btg family members of transcription factors. (C) High, medium, and low expression of transcription factors in four separate RNA preparations of mouse lung type II cells represented by red, yellow and green colors, respectively.
