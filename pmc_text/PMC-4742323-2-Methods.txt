Websites for downloading RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for 22 cancer datasets
The TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp) was used for downloading RNA-seq-based transcriptome data and patient survival information for 22 cancers. The RNA-seq data downloaded for each cancer are listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. As described in the previous report [10], expression values of 0<FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped)<0.1 were all converted to 0.1 to avoid the infinity problem. Each FPKM value of each gene was divided by the average FPKM estimated for the total patient samples where the gene is expressed and was log2-transformed, for which heat map analysis combined with hierarchical clustering was performed with the 'hclust' function of R package (https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/hclust.html).
