Heterozygous SNP calling and phasing
The heterozygous SNPs were phased using the phase function in Samtools, version 0.1.19-44428cd [17]. The Samtools phase algorithm calls heterozygous SNPs automatically and phases those that segregate on the same DNA fragment as inferred from paired-end read information in the BAM file. We used the default options for the Samtools phase function. We confirmed the heterozygous SNPs through independent calling using the Samtools mpileup function [17]. Whenever an LD block split into multiple phased haplotype blocks, we kept those that encompassed the significant SNPs from the GWAS.
