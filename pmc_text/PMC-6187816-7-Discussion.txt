In this short report, we did not provide any interpretable biological meanings for our statistically defined dominant state, yet. Therefore, our study should only be considered from a computational perspective, and, is thus a preliminary work. Still, it is important to note that we only used DNA sequences contained in the epigenetic datasets in modeling the Markov chains. Our study showed that once a dominant state for each 200-bp unit is assigned, a generalizable Markov framework can be achieved. Based on the framework, we showed that some subsets of the active chromatin states possessed a strong Markov property. We are currently investigating the overall co-occurrence of the 200-bp chromatin states for ENCODE ChromHMM datasets together with Roadmap Genomics datasets [11].
