Triple-ligand stimulation revealed Il-6 gene induction does not require de novo synthesis of NF-κBζ
We observed an interesting transcriptional change in gene clusters (Fig. 6). NF-κBζ is weakly expressed in cells but induced to a marked extent upon LPS stimulation and regulates a set of gene expression, including Il-6 [45]. However, a recent study demonstrated that Il-6 promoter can also be activated by unknown molecules acting far from the transcriptional active site by cis-regulatory molecules [46]. We observed the same phenomenon when we stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with KDO. NF-κBζ was upregulated by KDO at 60 min, and Il-6 was not induced by KDO till 120 min, which is in line with a previous observation [45]. This observation is very novel to be explained. Triple-ligand studies showed upregulation of Il-6 as early as 60 min (about 6-fold). This indicates that though KDO-induced pathways need de novo synthesis of NF-κBζ for Il-6 production, it does not require de novo synthesis of NF-κBζ for the induction of Il-6 when combined with IFN-β and 8-Br. We then looked for the possible ligand that could have mediated this and found that KDO and 8-Br never produced Il-6 on single-ligand stimulation. In that case, the only remaining candidate is IFN-β. IFN-β upregulated Il-6 in our experiment at 120 min (TLR3 can produce Il-6 due to the late phase of NF-κB activation). IFN-β also increased mRNAs of Atf3, Ccl4, and Map3k8 at 120 min. It is of interest to know what pathway regulates these genes in future studies, since most of them were reported to be regulated by a MyD88-dependent pathway during TLR signaling. Either the presence of a putative STAT1 site is sufficient to induce the MyD88-dependent genes or IFN-β might have crosstalk with the MAPK pathway.
