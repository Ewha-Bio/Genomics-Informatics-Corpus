Prediction of protein subcellular localization changes between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and normal (NOR) samples. (A) The correlation scores between NDUFA12 and other mitochondrial proteins in NOR and COPD samples. The thickness and color of the edges were determined by maximal information coefficient (MIC). (B) Genes with significant subcellular localization changes between COPD and NOR samples. (C) Heatmap demonstrating probability of changes in mitochondria-related proteins.
