Platelet counts and genotyping
Peripheral blood was isolated by using the G-DEX TM IIb DNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea). Platelet count was measured using an ADVIA 120 (Bayer, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Genomic DNA, genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), was isolated from peripheral blood drawn from Anseong and Ansan cohort participants. Of 9,603 genotyped samples, we excluded samples with high heterozygosity (>30%, n = 11) and gender inconsistencies (n = 41). Also, individuals who had developed any kind of cancer (n = 101) were excluded from subsequent analyses. To examine population stratification overall, related or identical individuals with higher values than first-degree relatives of Korean sib-pair samples were also excluded according to average pair-wise identity-by-state (IBS) values (>0.80, n = 608). The methods to estimate heterozygosity and IBS have been described elsewhere [13]. SNP markers with a high missing genotype rate (>5%), low minor allele frequency (MAF, <0.01), and significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1 Ã— 10-6) were excluded. Consequently, a total of 352,228 markers were used for the GWAS. For the replication analysis, 19 SNPs of the Health2 population, comprising 7,861 participants, were genotyped by GoldenGate assay (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
