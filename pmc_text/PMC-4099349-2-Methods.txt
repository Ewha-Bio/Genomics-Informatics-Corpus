Study subjects
Subjects in this study were recruited from the Asthma Genome Research Center, comprising the hospitals of Soonchunhyang, Chunnam, Chungbuk, Seoul National, and Chung-Ang Universities in Korea. All subjects provided written informed consents, and the study protocols were approved by the institutional review board of each hospital. Diagnosis of AERD was performed according to a modified method as previously described [12]. We also performed aspirin challenge in subjects with a history of aspirin hypersensitivity, presence of urticaria, nasal polyp, and sinusitis. The AERD case group included patients with 20% or greater decreases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or 15% to 19% decreases in FEV1 with naso-ocular or cutaneous reactions, whereas subjects showing a rate of FEV1 decline less than 15% without extrabronchial nasal or skin symptoms were included in the ATA group. The clinical diagnostic factors for the present study are summarized in Table 1.
