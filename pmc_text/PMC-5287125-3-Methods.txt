Candidate polymorphisms and genotyping
Five polymorphism sites were selected, based on a review of the literature and a genetic database. We searched the literature using the keywords ‘IL-10, polymorphism, and cancer’ in 3 years and decided to include five SNPs (rs1800896, rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3021094, and rs1554286), which are located in the promotor and intron regions of the IL-10 gene. These SNPs have been reported as having a significant association with cancer more than once out of 45 publications. Among them, rs1800896 was excluded from the analysis, because its minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.027. Genomic DNA was extracted from patients' peripheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and SNPs were genotyped using a Taqman 5' nuclease assay for allelic discrimination with commercially available Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, genotyping reactions were carried out in a volume of 5 µL, containing 10 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 µL of TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and genotyping probe, in a 384-well plate. Genotyping results were analyzed with an ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) by applying allelic discrimination plots using SDS 2.1 software (version 5.0; Applied Biosystems). Genotyping results were confirmed by independently replicating genotyping reactions for 10% of the samples, and all genotypes were the same.
