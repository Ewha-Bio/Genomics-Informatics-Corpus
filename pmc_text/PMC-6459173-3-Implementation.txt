Fig. 1 shows the hierarchical structural component analysis workflow for the HisCoM-mimi application, which requires miRNA and mRNA expression datasets and additional files (phenotype and covariates). The program now accepts two formats (miRNA and mRNA CEL files or an Excel-type expression dataset).
Next, miRNA-mRNA networks are constructed by combining the miRNA database information and correlation coefficients computed based on the user-entered datasets. Users can select an miRNA database in three ways: TargetScan results, miRTarBase results, and the intersection of both databases. The user can define the filtering network criteria by two options: (1) the choice of the databases and (2) a p-value threshold for the correlation coefficients between miRNAs and mRNAs.
After constructing an mRNA-miRNA integration set, HisCoM-mimi can be performed. HisCoM-mimi can accommodate not only the ridge penalty, but also the lasso and elastic-net penalties, which result in reduced computing time and a smaller number of nonzero coefficients [8, 9]. A cross-validation procedure is necessary to find the optimal penalties that maximize the log likelihood of the validation set [7].
