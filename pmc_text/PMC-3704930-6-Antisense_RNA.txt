RNA-seq technology has uncovered that 5% to 25% of all protein-coding genes encoded on the sense strand interact with the asRNAs that are transcribed from the antisense strand, thereby regulating their transcription, translation, or degradation (Fig. 2C) [8]. These transcripts are named asRNAs, which overlapped partially with the 5'-UTR or 3'-UTR of their target protein-coding genes [16]. The abundance of these transcripts has been revealed in several bacterial genomes, including Sallmonella Typhimurium [29], B. Subtilis [13], E. coli [45], Staphylococcus aureus [46], and M. pneumonia [6]. Using RNaseIII, which specifically degrades double-stranded short RNAs, for example, stable sRNA molecules that map symmetrically to both strands were enriched from Staphylococcus aureus. RNA-seq of the enriched RNA molecules resulted in the detection of 1387 ORFs, which covers 50% of the antisense strand [46]. Another study identified ~1,000 novel asRNAs in E. coli using high-throughput sequencing [45]. Briefly, the unique 5' end of the primary transcriptome was analyzed by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to convert 5'PPP groups into 5'P, followed by ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide and reverse-transcription with a random primer. Further studies of several asRNAs suggested that they are involved in a wide range of cellular mechanisms, such as the translational regulation of the quorum-sensing gene rpaR in Rhodopseudomonas palustris [47]. Based on the abundance of transcripts, it has been suggested that the number of asRNAs correlates negatively with genome size [7]. Large asRNAs could be the consequence of genome reduction with transcriptional regulation, mediated at the RNA level. Taken together, RNA-seq approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of the abundance of asRNAs in bacteria [42].
