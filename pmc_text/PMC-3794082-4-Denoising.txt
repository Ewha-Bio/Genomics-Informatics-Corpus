The first part of an analysis of NGS-generated data starts from filtering out 'noise' sequences. Most metagenomic studies based on single- or multiple-gene amplicons have used 454 pyrosequencing due to its advantage of producing longer read lengths, and currently available denoising algorithms have also been developed for that purpose. The denoising process per se does not remove actual sequences but keeps abundant information on erroneous sequences by retaining representative reads. Several denoising algorithms have been suggested so far. PyroNoise [11] implements a flowgram clustering method, and other denoising tools, such as Denoiser [12], DADA [13], and Acacia [14], use sequence abundance information on the denoising process. Similarly, single-linkage preclustering can be used before performing the formal OTU clustering to reduce 'noise' sequences generated by PCR and sequencing errors [30]. It first ranks sequences in order of decreasing abundance, and rarer sequences within a certain threshold are merged into the original abundant sequences.
