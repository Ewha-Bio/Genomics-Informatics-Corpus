The interaction between the developing gut microbiome and epigenetic processes is an important mechanism of developmental reprogramming of immune disorder, obesity, and metabolic disorders. There are mounting evidence supporting that gut microbiota may modify the pattern of DNA methylation and histone modification. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome produces plenty of metabolites come from maternal nutrients that have the potential to modulate DNA methylation and histone modification. Maternal nutrients may have a crucial role in early development and long term health consequences. This review explored the impact of maternal nutrients on epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the early-life microbiome profile. The importance of individual nutrients induced by epigenetic modulation will help achieve optimal gut microbiota and strategy for improving health consequences.
