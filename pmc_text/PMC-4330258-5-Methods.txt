Statistical analysis
Association analysis of platelet trait with genotypes was performed using a linear regression model, adjusting for age, sex, and recruitment area. Analyses were performed with the software PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink), SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and R statistics package version 2.7.1. The KARE GWAS and replication study were combined by an inverse-variance meta-analysis method, assuming fixed effects, with Cochran's Q test to assess between-study heterogeneity [16]. Regional plots were generated using LocusZoom [17].
