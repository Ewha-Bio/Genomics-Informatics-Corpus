PCR amplification
PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 5 µL with 10 ng of genomic DNA, 1.625 mM MgCl2, 0.1 units of HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen), 0.5 mM dNTPs (Invitrogen, Inc.), and 100 nM primers. The PCR reactions started at 94℃ for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94℃ for 20 s, 50℃ for 30 s, and 72℃ for 1 min, with a final extension of 72℃ for 3 min.
