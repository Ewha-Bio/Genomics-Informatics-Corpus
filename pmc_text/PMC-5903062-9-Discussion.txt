HSF estimation
The HSF can be viewed as the number of individuals requiring to explain the substitution rates present in a population. In SNP chip data, the HSF can be as close as 1. Founder effect can decrease nucleotide diversity and number of SNPs [23, 24]. Thus, smaller founder number can decrease the number of SNPs. Additionally, a population expansion after bottleneck events can increase the number of SNPs. Thus HSF should be estimated carefully, taking care of population history such as bottleneck event and population expansion.
The genes in Hanwoo and Holstein have average substitution rates on the order of 10-10. CNVs, microsatellites and minisatellites can also cause mutations. Therefore, it is very difficult to estimate the mutation rates with great accuracy. Instead, we focused on substitution rates which could be estimated using SNPs. The substitution rates on the order of 10-10 in Hanwoo and Holstein were similar to the human mutation rates [22].
The evolutionary distance can be assumed to be linear with HSF and the harmonic number of sample size (a1). Like Wattersonâ€™s theta estimator, the number of SNPs increases with sample size and thus we assumed that the evolutionary distance was linear with the harmonic mean of sample size (a1). Because HSF represents the independent substitution unit in the population, thus is linear with the number of SNPs in the population as Eq. (1).
