Analysis of somatic mutations
The number of detected mutations in each cancer type ranged from tens to hundreds of thousands. We organized the detected point mutations into 23,050 human genes. The number of mutant genes per sample was counted for ~3,000 samples. In addition, the mutation frequency and its percentage were calculated for all samples and each cancer type. The major mutant genes that ranked within the top 3 in each cancer type were selected based on the observed frequency in the overall, non-metastatic, and metastatic samples.
The patterns of frequency for the selected major genes were analyzed through hierarchical clustering method. The clustering and its visualization on a heatmap were performed using the software QCanvas [7]. QCanvas can be down-loaded freely from the website http://compbio.sookmyung.ac.kr/~qcanvas.
