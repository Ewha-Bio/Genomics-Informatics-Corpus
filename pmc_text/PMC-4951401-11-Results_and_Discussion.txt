Receptor-ligand interaction studies
Scoring functions play a major role in the docking process for identifying plausible ligand binding poses and also for ranking the binding affinity. Among the top 10 compounds, NSC95522, NSC88253, NSC13604, and NSC179676 (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1) were found to be highly significant in collective terms of XP Glide score, PASS prediction, formation of intermolecular H-bonds, and π-cation interactions with the critical hydrophobic cleft residues, as well as in the cysteine loop region. NSC95522 showed a Glide score of -10.564 kcal/mol and formed π-cation interactions with Tyr110, Tyr213, and Tyr215, stabilized by 3 hydrogen bonds formed with Tyr230, Ser232, and Tyr215 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Tyr230 is a vital residue in the hydrophobic cleft, as it is the central tyrosine of the apical groove and is mandatory for RON2 binding and also in the formation of a contiguous surface, which is critical for MJ assembly [30]. Ser232 is also documented in Plasmodium falciparum as a key hotspot residue, as it occupies the hydrophobic cleft-spanning region [31]. Tyr213 and Tyr215 are also crucial, as these residues are key facilitators of conformational changes in AMA1 DII loop displacement towards exposing a clear pocket to which Pro1309 of RON2 docks to the triad of tyrosine residues (Tyr110/142, Tyr213/234, and Tyr215/236) during AMA1-RON2 interactions [32]. PASS predicted this compound to be an ophthalmic drug and thus might also be found to be effective in treating adverse ocular-related effects due to toxoplasmosis.
NSC88253 was bound to the hydrophobic cleft of AMA1 with a XP Glide score of -10.392 kcal/mol, forming almost similar interactions to that of the AMA1-NSC95522 complex with 3 hydrogen bonds: 2 with the backbone of Tyr230 and Ser232 and 1 with the side chain of Tyr215. The π-cation interactions with Tyr110 and Tyr213 were also synonymously stabilized by hydrogen bonds formed by residues Tyr230, Tyr215, and Ser232 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Tyr110 is a coil connector and is documented to play an important role in the displacement of the DII loop of AMA1, which helps in the binding of RON2 [32]. PASS predicted this compound to be an ophthalmic drug with anticataract and corneal wound healing-stimulating activities, thus suggesting it to be an efficient inhibitor targeting ocular toxoplasmosis.
NSC13604 also showed interactions at the hydrophobic cleft of AMA1, with a XP Glide score of -10.016 kcal/mol. The docked complex showed 2 hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone of Met204, which occupies the cysteine loop region. It also formed π-cation interactions with Tyr213 and Tyr110, stabilized by the hydrogen bonds formed with Met204 (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Met204 is a key residue for AMA1 targeting, as it is present in the cysteine loop region, which is also a critical substructure for AMA1-RON2 complex formation. As per previous studies, disruption of the cysteine loop is found to exhibit inefficiency in domain-II loop displacement [17]. PASS predicted this compound to be antiprotozoal and may prove it to be efficient in targeting toxoplasmosis and also other apicomplexans.
NSC179676 showed interactions with the hydrophobic cleft, with an XP score of -9.893 kcal/mol. It formed a single hydrogen bond with the backbone Ser232, which is a critical residue, as discussed earlier. It also formed π-cation interactions with Tyr213 and Tyr110 (Supplementary Fig. 1I). PASS predicted this molecule to be antiprotozoal with corneal wound healing-stimulating activities. These four compounds exhibited significant features in terms of XP score, key molecular interactions, and relevant predicted activity in comparison to rest of the compounds. Hence, these compounds in complex with AMA1 were further validated for stability of complex formation by implementing MD simulation.
