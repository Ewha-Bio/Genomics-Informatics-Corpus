Key innovations
Our contribution consists in extending an existing neural NER system with additional features that had worked with classic CERs. In particular, POS tags, gazetteer features, and affixes features have been added to the network and were as a pre-preprocessing step. Different experiments have been conducted in order to determine whether these features improved the performance of the neural network. The extension of the neural network is domain and language-agnostic, while the pre-processing is domain-dependent and specific tools for Spanish medical texts have been used. By the neural network itself being language-agnostic we mean that our system could be adapted to other languages by building gazetteer and affix dictionaries and using a POS tagger trained for the required language.
