Anthropometric measurements
All measurements were made using standard techniques. The standing height was measured with a stadiometer (Jenix) attached to a wall. Weight, height, fat mass, muscle mass, and WHR were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (Inbody 720; Biospace, Seoul, Korea). BMI was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height (m). Subjects were divided into two groups by the 85 percentile of BMI values. Children with normal weight were the lower BMI group (BMI < 85th), and the higher BMI group was overweight (BMI â‰¥ 85th). Also, Rohrer index (RI) was measured by height and weight for obesity judgment. Skinfold thickness of the triceps and subscapular and suprailiac regions were measured by caliper (Cambridge Scientific Industries, Cambridge, MD, USA).
