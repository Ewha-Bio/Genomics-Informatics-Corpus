Similarly to whole genome or exome sequencing, RNAseq data is formatted in FASTQ (sequence and base quality). Numerous erroneous sequence variants can be introduced during the library preparation, sequencing, and imaging steps [7], which should be identified and filtered out in the data analysis step. Thus, QC of raw data should be performed as the initial step of routine RNA-seq workflow. Tools such as FastQC [8] and HTQC [9] can be applied in this step to assess the quality of raw data, enabling assessment of the overall and per-base quality for each read (i.e., read 1 and 2 in case of paired-end sequencing) in each sample. Depending on the RNA-seq library construction strategy, some form of read trimming may be advisable prior to aligning the RNA-seq data. Two common trimming strategies include "adapter trimming" and "quality trimming." Adapter trimming involves removal of the adapter sequence by masking specific sequences used during library construction. Quality trimming generally removes the ends of reads where base quality scores have decreased to a level such that sequence errors and the resulting mismatches prevent reads from aligning. The adapter trimming step is typically not necessary, as most recent sequencers provide raw data in which the adapters are already trimmed. In contrast, quality trimming may be an essential step depending on the analysis strategy used. The FASTX-Toolkit [10] and FLEXBAR [11] are useful for this purpose.
