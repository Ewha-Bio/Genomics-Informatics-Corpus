The relationship between evolutionary distance and founder number
Evolutionary distance is linear to mutation rate and substitution rate [17, 18]. Evolutionary distance is proportional to the harmonic number of of sample size (a1) because the sample size can increase the number of SNPs. Theta represents the population mutation parameter (θ = 4Nμ). While Watterson’s theta estimator (θ^=#segregating sitesa1) have been used irrespective of HSF and general SNPchip did not require HSF, in the NGS data, substitution rate (μ) would be high without the concept of HSF. HSF concept assumes that the initial found number after migration would not be equal to 1 like SNPchips. Biologically, that initial migration number was not 1, is very natural. a1 is the harmonic number of sample size n. We defined the evolutionary distance as the following:
(1) d = fa 1 μ t
, where d is evolutionary distance, f is the HSF, a1 is the harmonic number of sample size, μ is the substitution rate, and t is the divergence time between the species and reference species.
The evolutionary distance model was K2P [7, 19]. K2P assumes the transition/transversion ratio (tr/tv ratio). We set the tr/tv ratio to be 2.24, and the divergence time to be 4,000 years ago [4, 20, 21]. The increase in the number of SNPs could be caused by sample size and HSF.
