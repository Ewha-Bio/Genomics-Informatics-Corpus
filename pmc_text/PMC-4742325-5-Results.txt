We used the data from the Korea Holstein population. These data were collected from 462 cows recruited from 63 farms in South Korea, genotyped at 54,609 SNPs on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. There were 462 individuals and 41,099 autosomal SNPs after quality control (Methods section). All individuals were measured for three traits (milk yield, milk fat, and milk protein), which were related to milk production. The phenotypic correlations between pairwise traits are visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1. Correlations between milk yield and milk protein were much stronger than other pairwise comparisons.
We estimated the proportion of variance explained by fitting all SNPs in a mixed linear model for each of the three traits. In general, there was a substantial amount of variance explained by all autosomal SNPs after quality control on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (Ïƒ2G) for three traits of the records of two parities, with a mean of 43.51% (a range from 36.3 to 47%) across all three traits of the records of two parities (Table 1). In the records, the estimate of h2G was non-zero and reached the nominal significance level (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.05). We compared the estimates of h2G with the narrow-sense heritability h2, estimated from pedigree analyses in the literature based on Canada Holstein. The value of h2G was similar to h2 from pedigree analysis in the literature, and all common SNPs explained most (average, 43.51%; range from 36.3% to 47%) of the narrow-sense heritability (average, 41.38%; range from 36.3% to 47%), despite the estimates of h2 being from different country populations (Table 1). In contrast, when we performed a genome-wide association analysis in the same sample, we tried to identify genome-wide-significant (Bonfferoni correction p = 0.05) SNPs for three traits of parity 1. Three SNPs and one SNP were significant in milk yield and fat, respectively, and there were no significant SNPs for milk protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). We hypothesized that there was a major reason for only a few significant large-effect SNPs associated with Holstein traits related to milk production. First of all, many SNPs with small effects affected the three traits related to milk production. Second, according to previous studies, there are many common variants associated with the traits in humans at a nominally significant level, but their effect sizes are too small to be genome-wide-significant [7].
Using the same method as above but allowing multiple genetic components to be fit simultaneously in the model, we then partitioned h2G into the contributions of individual chromosomes for each of the three traits of two parities and plotted the estimate of variance explained by each chromosome (h2C) against the chromosome length for each trait. In a previous study, no linear correlation between h2C and chromosome length for any particular traits was observed for most traits in humans as strongly as shown in the other studies. Then, the average value of estimates of h2G over all of tens traits to reduce the sampling error variance, and the average estimated h2C was strongly correlated with chromosome length. However, we dealt with only three traits related to milk production, and we aimed to identify a linear correlation between h2C and chromosome length for each trait. The squared correlation between h2C and chromosome length using trait information of parity 1 was 0.46, 0.532, and 0.509 for milk yield, fat, and protein, respectively (Fig. 2). The regression slope of the proportion of the genetic variance attributed to each chromosome on the proportion of the genome represented by each chromosome was significant (p<0.1), suggesting a proportional relationship between genome length and genetic variance in Holstein. Consistent results were achieved from myriad genetic variants, each possessing a small effect throughout the widespread whole genome in Holstein.
In addition, we partitioned h2G into the contributions of genic (h2Gg) and intergenic (h2Gi) regions of the whole genome (Methods section). We estimated the variance explained by the genic (h2Cg) and intergenic (h2Ci) regions of each chromosome. The numbers of genic and intergenic SNPs on each chromosome are presented in Supplementary Table 2. We showed that the variance explained by the genic (intergenic) regions on each chromosome is also proportional to the total length of the genic (intergenic) regions (Fig. 3).
