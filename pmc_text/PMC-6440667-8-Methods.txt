Statistical analysis
For the GWAS, logistic regression analyses were used, controlling for sex as a covariate in the additive model. The performance was compared between model A (clinical data input only) and model B (clinical data + genetic data input) by drawing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and comparing the area under the curve confusion matrix. Statistical tests were performed using PLINK version 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2), SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R 3.2.2 (R Development Core Team; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
