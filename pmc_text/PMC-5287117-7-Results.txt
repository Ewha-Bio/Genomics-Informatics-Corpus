Selection of predictor variables
In each SNP set, the variable selection methods were applied to 5-fold CV on the training set. Fig. 2 shows information about the number of overlapping SNPs by 5-fold CV for each variable selection method. Table 3 provides a summary of the results of the variable selection. The variable selection methods gave very similar results in the ALL and ASIAN datasets, whereas the results showed differences among the methods in the KARE and ALL + KARE datasets. Furthermore, SLR generally tended to select a smaller number of SNPs than LASSO and EN.
