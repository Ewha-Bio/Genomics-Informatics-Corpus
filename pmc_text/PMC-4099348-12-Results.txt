Sequencing analysis of enriched DNAs
To analyze the enriched samples, we sequenced the DNAs using a GAIIx next-generation sequencing instrument (Illumina) and evaluated important metrics to consider actual coverage, specificity, and reproducibility across the targeted loci.
On average, 4.3 gigabases (Gb) was produced per sample, and they were mapped to the reference genome (NCBI build 37, hg19) at a 73-90% mapping rate (Table 3).
The 26-41% of the uniquely mapped reads were found in the region of interest, demonstrating moderate specificity of this approach. The normal sample showed the lowest mapping rate (73.03%) but the highest specificity (41.58%), indicating that cancer genomes are less efficient for exome sequencing due to genomic changes.
In addition, about 97% of the targeted bases were covered at more than 30× (Fig. 1). This high depth coverage could allow us to examine low-purity cancer samples, which are not normally analyzed by Sanger sequencing or genotyping tools. The actual coverage of the normal sample differed, depending on the gene. The coverage of most target genes was more than 95% at 30×, but two genes, CDKN2A and LTK, showed low coverage of 75% and 84%, respectively (Table 1).
Using the final mapped reads, we constructed a genomic profile database for detecting SNVs (Supplementary Table 1) and short insertions and deletions (INDELs) (Supplementary Table 2). In each sample, we identified 81-179 SNVs and 50-90 small INDELs in target gene regions (Table 4). Cancer samples (H-1650 and H-23) showed about twice as many SNVs than the normal sample (NA17022).
By subtracting SNVs found in the SNP databases, we identified cancer-specific somatic mutation candidates, and identical somatic mutations of the cancer cell lines in the COSMIC database were found. All previously known somatic mutations in the TP53, KRAS, and STK11 genes of sample H-23 and in the EGFR gene of sample H-1650 were identified in this study (Table 4).
The validity of the data was also examined with a genome-wide SNP microarray, which has 37 SNPs in the target region (Axiom Array; Affymetrix). The genotyping data showed 80-91% concordance without any bias (Table 5). The disconcordant variations were not biased to any sample, coverage, or genotype.
