Physical fitness tests
Seven performance tests were carried out. These included 20 m shuttle run, Sargent jump, right and left hand grip, 50 m run, sit-up, side-step, and sit-and-reach. We measured the fitness tests only for possible participants due to the long measuring time, so some of the fitness tests results were missing. The test protocols are described below.
- 20 m shuttle run: The subjects were required to run back and forth between two lines set 20 m apart. Running pace was regulated by a sound signal. The starting speed was set to 8.5 km/h and increased by 0.5 km/h every minute. The test ended when the subjects failed to reach the target line in time.
- Sargent jump: Test subjects were made to stand on a platform and were belted at the waist. Next, they were made to jump vertically as high as possible using both arms and legs. The measurement rope was then pulled onto the platform when the subjects jumped vertically and the length of the rope was compared to each other.
- Hand grip: Hand grip was assessed using Takei A5401-Digital Hand Grip Strength Dynamometer (Takei, Yashiroda, Japan). The subjects spread out their arms while squeezing as forcefully as possible (right, left), palms facing inward.
- 50 m run: The subjects were made to stand at a starting line and then made to run forward at full speed for a distance of 50 m.
- Sit-up: Subjects were made to sit on mats with knees bent at an angle of 90Â° with hands placed on both sides of the head. One sit-up was determined as touching the knees with the elbows and returning the hands to the ground. The number of sit-ups performed within one minute was counted.
- Side-step: Subjects were made to stand on a ground with a mid-line, which was equidistantly marked (100 cm) on either side with a parallel line each. They were made to step to the right until their right foot reached the right-line. Next, they were made to step to the left-line and pass the mid-line. After left foot reached the left-line subjects returned to their original position on the mid-line. This process was repeated for 60 s.
- Sit-and-Reach: Subjects were made to sit on a mat. Their knees pointed upwards as they stretched out legs. Next, they were made to bend forward with their upper body with their hands outstretched to push the measuring instrument.
