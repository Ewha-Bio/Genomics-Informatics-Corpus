Determination of gender by gender-specific markers
The CpG sites of X chromosomes in females are hypermethylated for dosage compensation of female X chromosomes [11]. By analyzing female-specific hypermethylated genes in the X chromosome (Supplementary Table 1), we identified 19 samples (0.39%) in which the methylation patterns of gender-specific CpG markers did not match the given gender information (Fig. 2A). When we analyzed those samples with male-specific hypermethylated genes in the Y chromosome (Supplementary Table 2), we again observed the opposite methylation patterns (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the discordant patterns were observed in eight of 11 datasets from different depositors, suggesting that the errors were not limited to one laboratory (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Interestingly, we found both types of discordant errors between DNA methylation patterns and given gender information. That is, for some samples, DNA methylation patterns were found to be female-specific while they were designated as males (designated here as discordant-male), and for the other samples, DNA methylation patterns were male-specific while they were designated as female (designated here as discordant-female).
