The comprehensive information on DNAJ/Ks conserved in 339 genomes over seven phyla is a useful resource for molecular chaperone studies in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis between phyla or kingdoms as well as genomic analysis within a species can be performed in the EDD. The user-friendly web interfaces and various analysis tools implemented in this database will accelerate the management of large-scale data. The EDD will be a novel platform for phylogenomic studies and a model for comprehensive genomic analyses.
