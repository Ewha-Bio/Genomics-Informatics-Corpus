Data processing and modeling
After data collection, we first classified each data into nodes (i.e., gene, protein, disease, drug, etc.) and relationships (i.e., gene-disease, disease-drug, or SNP-gene) and removed redundant and ambiguous nodes and relationships (Fig. 2). Then, we integrated and expanded all nodes and relationships (Fig. 3). Next, we created data models for each type of node and relationship (Figs. 4 and 5).
