MD simulation studies of the rpoB and RIF complex
A ligand binding interaction always influences the stability of the receptor protein. It was shown in Fig. 5A that the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) graph of wild-type rpoB lies a bit down than the S450L mutant during most of the time scale. The same was also observed in the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) plot (Fig. 5D), where most interacting amino acids of wild-type rpoB that participate in the interaction with RIF fluctuate less comparatively. This justifies that the sustainability of the rpoB-RIF interaction and wild-type rpoB is more acceptable over the mutant. We also calculated the average number of hydrogen bonds and their occurrence between the receptor and ligand in both cases and found that in the case of wild-type rpoB, the protein formed more consistent numbers of H-bonds with the ligand (Fig. 5B) as a consequence of a good interaction. Most importantly, these bindings were also described via interaction energies (IEs). The sum of short-range Coulombic and van der Waals interaction energies, taken as the total interaction energy between the protein and ligand, was plotted in Fig. 5C. This plot clearly indicates a big difference in IEs between the two complexes, and the wild-type rpoB possesses comparatively less interaction energy and hence shows more affinity towards RIF.
Brandis and Hughes [15] created the rpoB S531L mutation in Salmonella which is also present in other location of MTB and demonstrated that the minimum inhibitory concentration value of RIF for rpoB S531L mutant was 3,000 mg/L, whereas for the wild-type, it was only 12 mg/L [15]. This correlates with our in silico docking and MD simulation study-that mutant proteins with positive binding energy bind ineffectively with RIF compared to wild-type protein and thus may require high concentrations of RIF for inhibition.
We have employed a computational approach to study the interaction between RIF and rpoB and its mutant models. Our in silico docking study revealed that mutation in rpoB at amino acid positions 450 (S450L) and 445 (H445Y) might be involved in drug resistance. In wild-type rpoB, the RIF binds more effectively with rpoB with low binding energy and thus inhibits rpoB protein. Other mutations in rpoB need to be explored further for understanding the resistance mechanism.
