Two-stage gene-gene interaction analyses
We first apply the BOOST approach to select the promising pairs of SNPs with the a priori chosen τ. τ can be selected based on the available computing facility, and we set τ = 30 for our analyses. After filtering SNP pairs from the first stage with BOOST, we apply the logistic regression. BOOST can not adjust for the effects of covariates, and we applied logistic regression analysis with adjustments for sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and the top 10 principal component (PC) scores to the selected pairs of SNPs with BOOST. The logistic regression analysis was performed by using the glm function in R software. To calculate the p-values of the interaction term, we used the ANOVA function by comparing two fitted models in R.
