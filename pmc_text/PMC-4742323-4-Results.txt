Selection of two extreme patient groups and one intermediate group determined by G64 expression
The G64 genes were originally identified by their coregulated expression pattern in single cells derived from a single LADC tumor region [10]. Interestingly, we have reported that 488 LADC patients samples downloaded from the TCGA were also separated into two distinct groups by the G64 genes. In the present work, we examined whether G64 could be a classifier for other cancers, as well. For this analysis, 22 RNA-seq-based transcriptome data with a sample size ≥150 were retrieved from the TCGA. The threshold of 150 was selected, because it was considered to be the minimum number of samples for statistical tests between different groups (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).
As done in the previous LADC study [10], heat map analysis was performed for each cancer type to see how patient samples were separated by G64 (Supplementary Fig. 1). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, the co-regulated patterns of G64 expression were confirmed in all types of cancers we tested. However, distinct two-group separations were not as evident as the case for LADC. Therefore, we classifies patient samples further into three different categories by using a 15% extreme threshold of G64 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2): the highest 15% group, the lowest 15% group, and an intermediate group. For this purpose, the patients were sorted out by the intensity of the average FPKM values of the G64 genes expressed in each patient. As a result, for instance, among a total of 531 kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) samples, 160 samples were assigned into the two extreme groups—the highest 15% and the lowest 15%—whereas the remaining 371 samples were classified into the intermediate group.
