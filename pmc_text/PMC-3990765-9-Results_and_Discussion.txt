The features of genes associated with ESNPs and ECNPs
We obtained genes associated with ESNPs and ECNPs based on the NCBI Gene database [18]. We identified 156 ESNP-related genes and 52 ECNP-related genes (Supplementary Table 2). Most of the ESNP-containing genes were associated with known molecular functions encoded for cellular assembly and maintenance, cellular movement, cell death and survival, and lipid metabolism (Table 1). These ESNP-related gene sets (CEP192, GRK5, TUBGCP3, TUBGCP6, ABCA1, CHGA, ITGB3, VAV2, MYLK3, ANK2, ITGB3, ELN, LTBP4, FAM107B, DIDO1, HOXD3, PRPX2, KCNMA1, RASGRF1, NF1, and UBR2) showed association with diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, dermatological diseases and conditions, developmental disorders, and connective tissue disorders. Defects in latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4 (LTBP4) may be a cause of cutis laxa and severe pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and urinary abnormalities [19]. Centrosomal protein 192 kDa (CEP192) is part of a large multisubunit complex required for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome. This gene is regulated by hepatitis B virus and has roles in cells, such as duplication, replication, assembly, and nucleation. The ECNP-related genes are associated with known molecular functions encoded for cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, molecular transport, and drug metabolism (Table 1). These ECNP-containing genes (ARID1B, CAPN7, DDR2, SLC22A1, SLC22A3, ASTN2, GABRA5, GABRG3, RBFOX1, TLR4, MAG, TLR4, SNX9, and SYNJ2) are associated with cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, psychological disorders, and developmental disorders. Interestingly, the APOBEC gene, encoding the Câ†’U editing enzyme family, such as apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme and catalytic polypeptide-like 2, is associated with ECNPs. This editing gene could be affected by genetic diversity and admixtures in Pan-Asian populations. In this ethnically specific genetic variation study, we found the features of gene sets having ethnically specific variations. The AT-rich interactive domain 1B (SWI1-like) (ARID1B) gene encodes an AT-rich DNA interaction domain-containing protein. This protein is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and may play a role in cell-cycle activation. It is associated with chromatin-mediated maintenance of transcription and nervous system development. This gene is related to autosomal dominant mental retardation type 12. Discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) is associated with colorectal neoplasm, metastatic colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and so on. These ethnically specific genetic variations represent relationships with cell cycling, metabolism, and the developmental and immune systems. These genetic variations can be affected by admixture and evolution. These ethnically specific variants may be forced to adapt in order to survive in new environments and play a significant role in development and functional systems associated with diseases [20].
