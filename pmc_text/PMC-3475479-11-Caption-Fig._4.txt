A scheme of transcriptome expression analysis through massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) technology and bioinformatics: The identification of expressed genes through hybrid de novo assembly with Roche/454 and Illumina/Solexa data (left) and expressed level profiling through mapping the Illumina/Solexa sequence to the expressed sequence tag reference.
