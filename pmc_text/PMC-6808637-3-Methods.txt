Genome-wide association study (GWAS)
GWAS was performed using GCTA (a tool for genome-wide complex trait analysis) to estimate the beta effects [9,16]. The following model was:
(1) y = a + b x + g + e            
where y is the phenotypic value (BF%), a is the mean term, b is the additive beta effect of the candidate SNP for association, x is the SNP genotype indicator variable, g is the polygenic effect, and e is the residual. The covariates were sex (male and female), area (Ansan and Anseong) and age. The age was factored to be 10-age steps. The b was the beta effect of the SNPs.
