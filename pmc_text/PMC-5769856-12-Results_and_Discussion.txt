Detection of CNAs
Chromosomal alteration is one of the most commonly occurring events during tumorigenesis. OncoChase-AS was designed to detect CNAs for 54 genes, including most of the clinically important CNAs, such as ERBB2 amplification and CDKN2A/B deletion. To test whether OncoChase-AS detected CNAs properly, we analyzed two primary tumors (brain cancer and sarcoma) with known CNAs: ERBB2 amplification in a brain cancer and CDKN2A deletion in a sarcoma. As a result, the expected CNAs were detected precisely by OncoChase-AS NGS analysis (Fig. 3). When we validated the target CNAs by genomic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), the results were consistent with the NGS analysis results. Although we did not test all 54 target genes, the current results indicate that OncoChase-AS can robustly detect clinically important CNAs.
In conclusion, we have developed a cancer panel containing 95 cancer-related genes. In terms of the limit of detection, OncoChase-AS can detect more than 86% of target mutations with <1% MAF. In the case of those with >3% MAF, any mutation can be detected by NGS analysis with OncoChase-AS. When we applied this system for the analysis of Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA, which contains more than 500 COSMIC mutations across 53 genes, 99% of the expected mutations were robustly detected. We also confirmed the very high reproducibility of the mutation detection in multiple independent analyses. When we examined CNAs, two expected CNAs related to tumorigenesis were successfully detected, and this result was confirmed by target-specific genomic qPCR. All of these results support the reliability and accuracy of our Onco-Chase-AS platform in detecting mutations. Therefore, this panel could be helpful for key mutation profiling research in solid tumors and clinical translational research, because this panel covers all 14 essential genes that have been suggested to be included in cancer panels for support from the national health insurance system in Korea. There are limitations of our panel. Due to the technical limitations of PCR amplification-based NGS, OncoChase-AS cannot detect repeat sequences with enough reliability and reproducibility, such as microsatellite instabilities and the promoter region of the TERT gene. For this purpose, a hybridization-based targeted sequencing panel would be more suitable.
