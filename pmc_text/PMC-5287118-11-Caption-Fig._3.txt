Each set by MSE value, x-axis are the number of CV containing the selected variable. Group 1, 5 is a model from variables of the union of CV and of the intersection of CV, respectively. The gray bar indicates the SLR, the orange bar indicates the LASSO, the blue bar indicates the EN and the black line is MSE value of 10.24 from the prediction model using only covariates. MSE, mean square error; CV, cross-validation; ASIAN-100, genome-wide association study (GWAS) catalog (Asia) + single-single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis; KOREAN-100, GWAS catalog (Korea) + single-SNP analysis; ALL-200, GWAS catalog (All) + single-SNP analysis; ASIAN-200, GWAS catalog (Asia) + single-SNP analysis; KOREAN-200, GWAS catalog (Korea) + single-SNP analysis; GWAS-ALL, GWAS catalog (All); GWAS-ASIAN, GWAS catalog (Asia); SLR, stepwise linear regression; LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; EN, Elastic-Net.
