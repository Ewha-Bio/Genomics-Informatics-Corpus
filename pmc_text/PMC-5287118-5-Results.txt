To create the SNP sets associated with BMI, single-SNP analysis was performed by linear regression with adjustments for sex, age, and area. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1, we found one significant SNP (rs17178527) after Bonferroni correction (1.45 × 10−07). rs17178527 of LOC729076 has been reported as BMI-associated SNP in previous GWASs [2327]. In addition, Supplementary Table 1 shows the results of the single-SNP analysis with p-values less than 5.00 × 10−05. The SNPs that were reported to be associated with BMI in the GWAS catalog are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. Seven SNP sets are summarized in Table 2.
