Monocytes
Monocytes represent a relatively homogenous population of important precursor cells to peripheral macrophages and dendritic cells [18]. Monocytes have innate immune functions including immunomodulation, cytokine production, and phagocytosis [37]. In SjS, monocytes secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and B cell-activating factor (BAFF) upon stimulation [38], express type I interferon (IFN)-regulated genes [39, 40] with reduced expression of NFκB inhibitor (IκBα) [41], and show decreased phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [42]. Thus, monocytes reflect the inflammatory state in SjS patients and mature monocytes are proposed to contribute to salivary gland inflammation in SjS [43].
In our study published in 2016, monocytes purified from pSjS (n = 18) blood samples were compared by miRNA microarray with those purified from other disease controls of RA (n = 10), SLE (n = 10), and HC (n = 10) [18]. To validate selected miRNAs from the microarray analysis, the microarray cohort and a new cohort of monocyte RNA samples from 9 HC, 12 SjS, 8 SLE, and 9 RA patients were evaluated by qRT-PCR. We demonstrated that miR-34b-3p, miR-4701-5p, miR-609, miR-300, miR-3162-3p, and miR-877-3p were differentially expressed in 43% of pSjS patients compared to 5.8% and 5.6% for SLE and RA, respectively. Interestingly, the canonical transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway showed the greatest coverage of predicted targets, averaging 40.5% ± 23.1% pathway coverage for the six SjS-associated miRNAs. This suggests that these miRNAs preferentially target the canonical transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway as opposed to pro-inflammatory IL-12 and Toll-like receptor/NFkB pathways in SjS pathogenesis [18].
As our study was limited to RNA analyses, relationships between miRNAs and their post-transcriptional inhibition of target genes at the protein level need to be addressed as soon as sufficient human monocytes are collected. Nevertheless, SMAD4 gene expression exhibited repression in a subpopulation of pSjS patients by our SjS-associated miRNAs [18]. The SMAD4 protein of the family of TGFβ signaling molecules acts as an essential common mediator for receptor-regulated SMADs to enter the nucleus. Interestingly, miR-300 and miR-609 showed the strongest co-association by regression analyses and target prediction analyses, which indicates that SMAD4 may be targeted by SjS-associated miRNAs in a cooperative manner. To our knowledge, this is the only study where SjS monocytes were analyzed for miRNA profiling.
