Molecular docking of enoyl reductase (ER) with its substrate. (A) Substrate trans butenoyl is docked to the ER domain. The substrate is shown in ball and stick form, the hydrogen bond is a dotted yellow line, and weak interactions are dotted orange lines. (B) 2D interaction map of trans butenoyl substrate with the ER domain. Amino acids are mentioned with 3 letter codes, and arrow indicates hydrogen bonding with Val1680.
