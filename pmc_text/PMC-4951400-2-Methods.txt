TCGA COAD DNA methylation datasets and expression datasets
Both methylation and gene expression data were obtained from the TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/). We collected COAD Level 3 (pre-processed) JHU-USC HumanMethylation450 data for methylation and UNC illuminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2 data for gene expression. We neglected a normalization step for both datasets, since they were pre-processed and normalized by uploaded groups. We matched methylation and gene expression data by patient header ID using the TCGA barcode. Beta-value, a value of the ratio of the methylated probe intensity and the overall intensity, was used to represent the methylation percentage. Gene expression fold-change was calculated by taking scaled estimate values, multiplying by 106 (transcripts per million, TPM), adding 1 to each normal and tumor TPM, and then taking the log2 value of tumor and normal per gene.
