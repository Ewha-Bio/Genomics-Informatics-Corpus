Genotyping and quality control
A total of 532 samples were genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Samples that revealed the following properties were excluded: genotyping call < 98%, heterozygosity > 30%, sex inconsistency, cryptic first-degree relative, or duplication. A total of 48 subjects were excluded from the sample QC process. Markers with a high missing call rate (> 5%), minor allele frequency < 0.01, and significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1 Ã— 10-6) were also excluded. The remaining 747,076 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in subsequent analyses for association.
