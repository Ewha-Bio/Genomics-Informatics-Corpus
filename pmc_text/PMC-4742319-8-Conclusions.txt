The role of chromosomal rearrangement led us to understand the evolutionary history of crocodilians to sauropsids and within the crocodilian lineage. It is likely that centric fusion/fission is a key evolutionary force of crocodilian diversity. The Crocodylus group is considered to have variation of karyotypic features, comprising 2n = 30, 32, and 34, whereas the chromosome number of the remaining group was fixed in each lineage. The Crocodylus species originated from an ancestor in the Indo-Pacific, and rapidly radiated and dispersed around the globe during a dire period in crocodilian extinction. Moreover, Crocodylus species probably underwent multiple transoceanic dispersions from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and to the New World. Karyotype analysis also supported the direction of molecular phylogenetic placement in crocodilians, which was previously controversial. The study also provided insight into the phylogenetic hierarchy of genome evolution in crocodilians.
