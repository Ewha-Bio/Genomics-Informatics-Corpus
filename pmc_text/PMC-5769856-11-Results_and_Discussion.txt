Reproducibility of mutation detection
Cancer gene panels can be used for clinical tests, such as the identification of druggable mutations from tumor tissue or liquid biopsy, in addition to research. Therefore, the reproducibility of mutation detection is an important issue. To test the reproducibility of mutation detection, we performed OncoChase-AS NGS with four cell lines (H1975, HCT116, HT29, and SW620) harboring eight known mutations (Table 3). In this analysis, cell line mixture samples were sequenced in triplicate by two different researchers. All of the expected mutations in mixtures and the MAFs were measured in every run. With these results, we verified the repeatability and reproducibility of the Onco-Chase-AS panel. The average repeatability and reproducibility were 98% (ranging from 93% to 100%) and 98% (ranging from 95% to 100%), respectively (Table 3).
