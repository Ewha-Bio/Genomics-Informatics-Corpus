Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now well established for discovering hypothesis-free genetic loci whose variations are associated with a phenotype [1-4]. Downstream analysis of the study result in terms of gene sets is gaining popularity these days, as it facilitates biological interpretation of a GWA result [5].
The Korea Association Resource (KARE) project has collected epidemiological and genotype data from the regional cohorts in Ansung and Ansan, Korea [6]. A number of GWA studies based on this KARE data have been published so far [6-8]. We pursued re-analyses of these studies in terms of gene sets in a systematic way to warrant cross-comparisons of the traits. We mimicked the analysis conditions of the original published GWA works as much as possible, based on the de facto standard program PLINK [9]. For the gene set analysis, we used GSA-SNP software [10], an efficient Java-based application that accepts a list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their association p-values and outputs the gene set p-values after multiple testing correction.
We applied this procedure to 49 baseline quantitative traits that were of epidemiological, anthropometric, or blood chemistry parameters. As expected, those traits that are known to share common biological mechanisms and to overlap in their population incidences indeed showed similar profiles of the significantly associated gene sets. To our surprise, some of the traits that were phenotypically uncorrelated in our study population and were seemingly unrelated to each other showed similar profiles of the significantly associated gene sets. Our results may demonstrate a useful strategy of discovering pleiotropy, which refers to a phenomenon of common pathways involved in distinct phenotypes.
