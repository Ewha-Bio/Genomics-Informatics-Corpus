Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common malignancy in males [1]. It is known that about 20% of PC patients experience disease progression and distant metastasis [2, 3]. The therapeutic options for patients with aggressive PC include prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [4]. Although ADT therapy induces short 2–3-year remissions, unfortunately, most PCs eventually progress into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) [3], which does not respond to ADT therapy and shows poor clinical behavior. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the molecular characteristics and identify robust biomarkers that are associated with the development of CRPC from primary PC.
High-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have gradually uncovered the molecular characteristics of PC, along with CRPC [5–8]. However, many genomic studies on CRPC have been conducted on metastasized CRPC that has been discovered at distant organs. These studies of metastatic sites do not reflect the precise molecular characteristics of CRPC, because these sites are not the primary PC site and because metastatic sites have completely different microenvironments from the primary site [9]. Here, we generated a dataset of whole genomes from four pairs of primary PC and CRPC samples from the same patient (i.e., a total of eight paired samples from four PC patients). In this report, the genomic status of samples with primary PC and CRPC was explored, and different variants between these two distinct phenotypes were identified by comparing the genomes of primary PC and its paired CRPC.
