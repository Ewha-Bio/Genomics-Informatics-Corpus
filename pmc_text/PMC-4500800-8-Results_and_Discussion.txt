Interaction study of HPV18 E6 with natural ligands through docking analysis
As all the natural compounds were observed to be interact with E6 protein in different conformations and binding energy, the conformation with lowest binding energy was selected for analysis (Table 2). In case of HPV16 E6 protein, amino acid residues 113-122 (CQKPLCPEEK) were associated with p53 binding [38]. In our previous study we elucidated molecular interaction of HPV16 E6 proteins with natural inhibitors around these p53 binding site [37]. Upon BLAST [39] sequence comparison of E6 protein of HPV16 and HPV18, it was observed that 80% of the p53 binding residues, conserved in E6 of HPV18 (Fig. 3). Thus, on the basis of molecular interaction of p53 binding site residues with E6 protein, the active site residues i.e., 108-117 (CQKPLNPAEK) of HPV18 E6 protein were consider for docking analysis.
Fig. 4 showed best docking conformation of E6 protein with twelve ligand molecules and the complete interactions were put in Table 2. It was observed that all the ligands were interacting with E6 protein at p53 binding site residues. WA was observed to bind with HPV18 E6 protein with lowest binding energy of -5.85 kcal/mol and the inhibition constant was found to be 51.35 µM. It was found to interact with four amino acid residues of E6 (Glu116, Asn113, Asn122, and Ser140) by forming hydrogen bonds. Next to WA, artemisinin bound with E6 protein with binding energy of -5.68 kcal/mol and inhibition constant of 68.22 µM. It formed only one hydrogen bonds with the receptor at Leu112 residues. Ursolic acid and ferulic acid also observed to inhibit E6 protein with good binding affinity i.e., binding energy of -5.31 and -5.18 kcal/mol, respectively. Other six natural compounds indol-3-carbinol, resveratrol, jaceosidin, berberine, EGCG, and curcumin were observed to bind with the receptor (E6 protein) with binding energy range from -4.98 kcal/mol to -4.08 kcal/mol (Table 2). Further, other two compounds silymarin and gingerol found to interact with the receptor with less binding affinity i.e., binding energy of -3.67 kcal/mol and -2.86 kcal/mol.
Few recent in silico studies are also been carried out on HPV showing the importance of computational approach in drug designing. Muthukala et al. [40] observed the inhibitory effect of quercetin compound against human cervical cancer cell line proteins through in silico docking analysis. Kotadiya and Georrge [41] identified some putative drugs from natural products against HPV through in silico approach. Samant et al. [42] studied the molecular interactions of human immunodeficiency virus antiviral drugs against HPV18 E6 through in silico approach. Mamgain et al. [43] also observed the inhibitory effect of natural compounds such as colchine, curcumin, daphnoretin, ellipticine, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, etc. against HPV16 E6 protein using molecular docking [43]. In our study, we have taken 12 natural compounds, reported to be used as an anti cancer agent against HPV [1112131415161718192021222324252627] for docking analysis and observed their molecular interaction against HPV18 E6. All the natural compounds were found to interact with p53 binding site residues of HPV18 E6 onco-protein.
This interaction might disable E6 protein to bind with the host p53 protein helping correlate these natural compounds used as anti-cancerous agents to treat HPV infections.
For treatment of different cancers caused by HPV, various plant-originated compounds have been identified and tried as hopeful resources for cancer therapy. Due to the encroachment in computational biology and bioinformatics, validation of those natural compounds is possible through computational approach. The E6 protein of HPV6 and HPV11 (low risk HPVs) is not able to degrade p53 protein whereas in case of high risk HPVs (HPV16 and HPV18), the E6 protein able to inactivate p53 protein by inducing its degradation. Thus, in order to design a novel drug against cervical cancer, the HPV18 E6 protein can be considered as a suitable target. In this study, high throughput computational approach have been employed for modeling tertiary structure of E6 protein followed by docking using AutoDock 4.2. This computational approach needs to be explored further in order to design novel drugs against cervical cancer from natural resources.
