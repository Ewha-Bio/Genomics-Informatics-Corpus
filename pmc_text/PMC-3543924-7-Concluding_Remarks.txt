GDM women are at increased risk of developing T2DM and have familial clustering of T2DM. A common pathophysiology that is shared by GDM and T2DM is impaired compensatory increase in insulin secretion to overcome the increased insulin resistance. The GWA study of GDM enabled us to investigate the common genetic risk factors of GDM, and it revealed that GDM and T2DM share similar genetic backgrounds, at least in part (Fig. 2). Although this information has significantly improved our insight in the pathogenesis of GDM, there are more unanswered questions remaining that should be explicitly expressed. Using the technology of next-generation sequencing, it is expected that more causal, rare variants will be identified. This genetic information would ultimately improve our prediction of GDM and future T2DM. In addition, we hope that personalized genomic medicine could be available using the advances in the genetics of GDM and T2DM.
