Flavobacterium is a genus of gram-negative bacteria belonging to the family Flavobacteriaceae (order: Flavobacteriales, class: Flavobacteria, phylum: Bacteroidetes) [1]. The term Flavobacterium was first introduced by Bergey et al. in 1923 [1]. Since then, a number of Flavobacterium species have been identified, and the classification of the genus has been continuously amended. At present, it is widely accepted that the genus Flavobacterium contains bacteria that are yellow-pigmented, aerobic, and generally rod-shaped [2], and some Flavobacterium species mobilize through a gliding motility mechanism [3]. Flavobacterium strains could be isolated from various habitats, including freshwater, soil, plants, and food [3, 4].
The 16S rRNA gene has been widely used in many studies concerned with the identification or classification of microorganisms. However, using only one housekeeping gene as a single marker is not enough to distinguish some bacterial species, especially when they are closely related. In addition, gene-specific changes caused by horizontal gene transfer or recombination could be an obstacle to the phylogenetic studies that are based on a single gene marker [5, 6]. To overcome the limitation, multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) has been proposed as an alternative method in many studies. In reality, MLSA is a microbial genotyping method used to characterize a variety of microorganisms, including the genera of Pantoea [7], Bifidobacterium [8], Borrelia [9], Bradyrhizobium [10], and Bacteroides [11]. In MLSA, approximately seven housekeeping genes are required, but a standard for the given number and size of genes has not been established. This concise approach is based on concatenated sequences of multiple housekeeping genes, uses the concatenated sequences to identify the phylogenetic aspects of desired species, and investigates the patterns of genotypes between each species cluster [12].
This study was designed to classify the genetic diversity of collected Flavobacterium species. In addition, we also investigated their relationship using phylogenetic analysis and compared the results for phylogenetic markers.
