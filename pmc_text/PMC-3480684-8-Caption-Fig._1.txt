Combined effects of risk alleles on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Allelic dosage scores are plotted on the X axis. The histogram (Y axis on left, grey bars) represents the percentage of individuals in each risk allele category. The histogram (Y axis on right, black bars) represents mean HDL-C concentrations. (A) Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including the risk alleles (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC). (B) Six SNPs without the risk alleles (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at LIPC).
