Filtering data and restoring binary information
We used two methods for restoring binary information. First, we used “Canu” software, which is a de novo assembler based on Linux [7]. The consensus sequence of de novo assembly is used to further detect “start,” “end,” 0, and 1 signals. We searched the signal sequence by allowing a 1-bp mismatch in the signal location.
