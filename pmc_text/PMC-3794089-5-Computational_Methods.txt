Parameter settings for alignments and clustering
Global alignment with a gap open penalty of 13, extension penalty of 3, and free end gap penalty was conducted for sequences of 30 proteases and 30 kinases. A UPGMA algorithm with bootstrapping of 100 replicates was used for tree construction from a sequence of proteases. CLC bioinformatics workbench was used for alignment and tree calculation, and the Geneious workbench was used for graphical representation. (8 + logPr), RamRMSD, and (1-TM-score) were used for distance, and a Fitch-Margoliash algorithm was employed for building trees from protein structures. TM-score was normalized by the size of the target protein of the comparison pair. An appropriate integer (8) was added to logPr to make distances positive. Trees were generated from a distance matrix using the FITCH program of the PHYLIP package. The Geneious workbench was used for graphical representation of trees.
