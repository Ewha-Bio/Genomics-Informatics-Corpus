There are two strategies in which a genome or transcriptome is used as a reference for the read alignment step [12]. The transcriptome comprises all transcripts in a given specimen and in which splicing has been conducted by including the exons and excluding the introns. If a transcriptome is used as a reference, unspliced aligners that do not allow large gaps may be the proper choice for accurate read mapping. Stampy, Mapping and Assembly with Quality (MAQ) [13], Burrow-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [14], and Bowtie [15] can be used in this case. This alignment is limited to the identification of known exons and junctions because it does not identify splicing events involving novel exons. However, if the genome is used as a reference, spliced aligners that allow a wide range of gaps should be employed because reads aligned at exon-exon junctions will be split into two fragments. This approach may increase the probability of identifying novel transcripts generated by alternative splicing. Various spliced aligners have been developed, including TopHat [16], MapSplice [17], STAR [18], and GSNAP [19].
