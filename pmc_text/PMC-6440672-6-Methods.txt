Pre-screening
Pre-screening of gene markers was used after gene filtration. This process is necessary for actual computation and controlling false positives. Unsupervised filtering using median absolute deviation (MAD) was used. MAD is widely used in microarray data and single-cell RNA-Seq data as a pre-screening method. This measure can be used to select more variable genes. Compared with standard deviation, MAD is a more robust measure [14]. Since the raw count data consist of sparse and non-negative numbers, MAD was used to represent variability. The genes with MAD were selected for model building.
Another supervised pre-screening method was used, based on univariate Cox regression with adjustment of clinical variables. This Cox regression procedure was performed only for the training set to avoid overfitting. Next, genes were selected, based on individual p-values. Both methods were jointly applied to select candidate gene markers.
