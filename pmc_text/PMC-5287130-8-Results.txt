Most significant and truly significant features in different tissues
In order to find out which feature has the most significant correlation with the gene expression level in different tissues, the features with the least p-value were recognized (Table 1, Fig. 4). Also, since multiple correlations were done in the current study, the FDR analysis was done to decrease the statistical errors (Table 2). Through this analysis, we calculated the corrected p-values in order to find truly significant feature. By FDR analysis, we found some truly significant features such as AAG (coding lysine) and GAC (coding aspartate) codons (drawn from codon frequencies), lysine and aspartate (drawn from amino acid frequencies), and CTCL (from synonymous codon usage features) which are common among some tissues (Table 2).
