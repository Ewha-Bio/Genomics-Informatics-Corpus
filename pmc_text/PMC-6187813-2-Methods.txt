Tissues samples
Four pairs of primary PC and CRPC tissues were obtained from Chungbuk National University Hospital (Korea) with informed consent and approval of the Internal Review Board at Chungbuk National University. To obtain a consistent variant profile that was associated with the development of CRPC, primary CRPCs were obtained from homogenous biopsy sites, and none of our PC samples was from distant metastatic sites. Detailed clinical characteristics of the four pairs of primary PC and CRPC tissues are described in Supplementary Table 1.
