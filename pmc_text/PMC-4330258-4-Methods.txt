Imputation
Imputation was carried out by using the IMPUTE program version 1 (http://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute.html) [14, 15]. On the basis of NCBI, build 36 and dbSNP, build 126, we initially used 90 individuals from Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) founders in HapMap as a reference panel, comprising 3.99 million SNPs (release 22). After removing SNPs with an MAF < 0.01 and an SNP missing rate > 0.05, we combined the remaining 1.8 million imputed SNPs with the directly typed Korea Association Resource (KARE) SNPs for the association analyses. Association analyses for imputed SNPs were carried out by the SNPTEST program (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/snptest.html).
