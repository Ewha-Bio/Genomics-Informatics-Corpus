Approximately 22.2 and 21.8 million reads were obtained by Illumina sequencing for P. antarcticus (accumulated base pairs, 6,675,343,822 bp) and P. papua (accumulated base pairs, 6,574,802,598 bp), respectively. In total, 26,036 contigs with an average length of 863 bp and an N50 length of 929 bp were obtained in the P. antarcticus blood transcriptome, whereas in the P. papua blood transcriptome, 21,854 contigs with an average length of 857 bp and an N50 length of 933 bp were obtained.
Overall, the principal BLAST hits of the penguin transcripts exhibited high similarity to avian genomic information at both class and family levels (Fig. 1A). Of the top hits, 86% of P. antarcticus and P. papua contigs were homologous to transcripts from the class Aves. At the family level, both contigs showed high similarity to Falconiformes (28%), followed by Passeriformes (19%). These results suggest that the blood sample preparation and Illumina sequencing were successful, as the raw read assembly was undoubtedly characterized as avian. Of the P. antarcticus contigs, 2,476 and 2,450 exhibited sequence similarity to transcripts from the rock pigeon Columba livia and the peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, respectively. In the case of the P. papua contigs, approximately 2,130 and 2,197 showed sequence similarity to transcripts from C. livia and F. peregrinus, respectively. A previous study generated a total of 15,270 and 16,070 protein-coding genes annotated from Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguin genomes [36]. However, the contigs from the current study did not match their genomic information, because only raw sequencing reads of Adélie and emperor penguins were registered in NCBI and annotation data were deposited. Thus, we analyzed orthologous similarity of the penguin transcripts after retrieving the annotated genes of Adélie and emperor penguins [36].
Ortholog comparisons showed extensive similarity within penguins (Fig. 1B). Most transcripts of each penguin matched at least one of the other species. Of the contigs, 3,969 were shared among the four penguins, whereas 1,320, 13,294, 1,699, and 9,290 contigs remained unique to the species Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, and gentoo, respectively. Within the genus Pygoscelis, 4,018 contigs were shared among the three penguins within that genus. Overall, 11,045 homologues were observed between the chinstrap and gentoo penguins and 12,387 contigs were identified as homologues between the Adélie and emperor penguins. Although a relatively small number of genes were annotated from the genomes of the Adélie and emperor penguins, this result suggests that blood transcriptomes share many genes encoding for proteins with blood-specific functions.
The specific GO composition of each principal category (i.e., cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions) is presented for the P. antarcticus and P. papua contigs at a Level 2 percentage using default parameters. Overall, similar compositions of GO terms in each category were observed among the blood transcriptomes (Fig. 2). The vast majority of transcripts in the cellular components category were assigned to cells (34%), organelles (30%), and macromolecular complexes (12%–13%) (Fig. 2A). In terms of the biological processes category, many genes were classified as cellular (18%–19%), metabolic (15%), and single-organism processes (13%–14%) (Fig. 2B). Of the GO terms related to molecular function, many genes were categorized as binding (49%–50%) and catalytic activity (30%–31%) components (Fig. 2C). Because blood is one of the most dynamic tissues and encompasses a wide range of cellular metabolisms and numerous exogenous and endogenous factors, the diverse GO assignments analyzed by Blast2GO suggest that penguin blood performs many complex biological functions.
Of the 20 highest RPKM values, several mRNAs coding for hemoglobin genes were detected in both the P. antarcticus and P. papua transcriptomes. Because diving birds have developed elevated hemoglobin levels to hold their breath for long periods of time [37], high RPKM values for hemoglobin genes would relate to the capacity for oxygen storage and transfer during routine diving by penguins. Although only limited information is available on the correlation between abundance of hemoglobin gene and oxygen level in penguins, it was identified that hemoglobin concentration is strongly associated with free-diving physiology such as gas exchanges (e.g., oxygen storage, saturation, and depletion) in seals [38,39]. Several major vertebrate canonical signaling pathways such as the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB, #04064), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT, #04630), and Toll-like receptor (TLR, #04620) are important for responding to exogenous pathogens and maintaining homeostasis [40]. In the P. antarcticus and P. papua blood transcriptomes, the most crucial proteins of innate immunity signaling were detected in the NF-κB (Fig. 3), JAK-STAT (Fig. 4A), and TLR (Fig. 4B) pathways in KEGG pathway analyses. In addition, the transcriptional involvement of immunity-related genes of the TLR, immune deficiency (Imd, #04624), transforming growth factor β (#04350), and interleukin 17 (#04657) signaling pathways were also identified. Overall, the emperor penguin had the greatest number of matched transcripts, whereas the Adélie only had a few proteins from each pathway. A relatively low amount of immunity-related genes were identified in the in the chinstrap and gentoo transcriptomes compared to the emperor penguin. In addition, there was a complete lack of several components from each pathway. This could be explained by the fact that both penguins considered in this study may not be affected by environmental factors or infections. However, the core proteins matched from each pathway suggest that the major innate immune systems are likely expressed and serve as a host defense modulator against exogenous pathological changes in penguin blood. Because the profiling of blood transcriptomes can reflect pathological changes such as immune cell circulation throughout the animal body [41-44] and penguins are sentinel species in the circumpolar region of the Southern Ocean, analyses of blood transcriptomes and hematological parameters could be used as a marker of health status, disease, and response to exposure in penguins.
Here, we presented the first whole-blood transcriptome of two penguin species, the chinstrap and gentoo, and a comparison of pathways involved in the major innate immune systems of four penguin species. Transcriptomic data were successfully obtained from the blood of the penguins and the transcriptomes covered the essential gene repertoire. These data will be useful for understanding the molecular adaptations and immune homeostasis of Antarctic penguins, thereby allowing researchers to assess their health status and resistance to diseases.
