Genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). The pharmacogenomics screening was performed using an Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at DNA Link Co. Ltd. (Seoul, Korea) according to the previously described method [14]. The microarray covered 1,931 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) and 5 copy-number variations for 255 genes involved in the metabolism, transport, and excretion of drugs in humans and its utility and robustness has been validated in previous reports [15, 16]. Furthemore, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to confirm the GSTM1 copy number variant identified from the microarray.
