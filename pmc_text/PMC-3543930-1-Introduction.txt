There are many ways that research gaps between science and technology can be identified. Bibliographic citation of both academic literature and patent documents is one of the solutions. Unfortunately, patent documents are considerably less accessible [1], compared to academic papers. Whereas vast amount of new information is made available to the public through patents, only a small set of patents are cited in academic papers [2].
Thus, the essential problem arising from citing patents related to bioinformatics is to devise a classification methodology that identifies the relevant patent and only those patents. The suitability of the methodology depends on the purpose of the analysis. However, no single methodology is ideal for identifying patents for a convergence technology, such as bioinformatics. By its nature, it is at the intersection of a number of patent classes.
Accordingly, this paper tentatively employs several methodologies simultaneously to analyze the current status of bioinformatics and to find relevant subclasses, using the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS, http://www.kipris.or.kr/) patent search system. Initially, a multiple-word search is undertaken of these patents' titles and abstracts. The selected lists are then tabulated, based on International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses together with some known bioinformatics subclasses. These were then reviewed manually to establish a revised list of bioinformatics patents. These steps have been repeated several times to establish the list of relevant IPC subclasses that appear most frequently in KIPRIS bioinformatics patents.
