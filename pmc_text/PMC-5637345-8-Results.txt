Target genes analyses of miR-21-3p
All target genes were analyzed using GO by PANTHER Gene List Analysis system. One of the three categories BP associated to cellular process and metabolic process functions. MF and CC revealed that multiple genes were related to binding activity, catalytic activity, cell part, and organelle component, respectively (Fig. 4). Binding sites (5´-CGACUG-3´) of target genes for the miR-21-3p were analyzed by Targetscan program, which mainly appeared in species-specific genes (Table 1). MFE score from hybridization of seed region and binding site was almost less than ‒15 kcal/mol. The binding affinity between miRNA and 3’ UTR region of target genes seem to be strong in brown bat (KANK2), cat (SNAPC3), elephant (HN1), lizard (AIFM1), opossum (RELA), and rabbit (PPIL2) species as the average value of MFE was below ‒25 kcal/mol. Target genes generate stem-loop complexes with their respective miRNA at the seed region of miR-21-3p and the binding site of target gene (Fig. 5).
