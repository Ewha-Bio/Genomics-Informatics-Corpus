Identifying each individual sequence is of great importance in microbial community analysis, as taxonomic information gives us access to basic information of its traits, such as physiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary history, and it allows for indirect inference of their ecological roles in a given environment. There are several methods that have been suggested for assigning microbial taxonomy with high-throughput sequence data. BLAST [45] is one of the most widely used algorithms when classifying sequences. The top BLAST hits by searching against reference databases are generally used for taxonomic identification of query sequences. There are several well-curated public SSU databases, such as RDP [22], SILVA [23], Greengenes [24], and EzTaxon-e [25]. However, the top BLAST hit does not always give the correct taxonomy result, especially in shorter reads. Alternatively, Greengenes and EzTaxon-e use BLAST in conjunction with global alignment, and the post processing of a BLAST-aligned output has been suggested to improve assignment accuracy using the lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm in MEGAN [46] and the optimal consensus method (F-measure) in TANGO [47]. The probabilistic approach also gives a similar level of accuracy but is much faster than a BLAST search. The na√Øve Bayesian algorithm [48], implemented in RDP, uses 8-mer word-matching for training datasets and provides assignment results with bootstrapped confidence estimates. Phylogenetic placement method is a recently suggested approach that places query sequences into a phylogenetic guide tree on the basis of various evolutionary models. This approach is particularly useful in a case where there are no close relatives to the query sequence in databases, due primarily to the low DB coverage, which is the case with microbial eukaryotes. Tools using phylogenetic methods in taxonomic assignment include the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) [49], pplacer [50], and SEPP [51], and these algorithms were recently incorporated into QIIME [28] and AMPHORA2 [52].
