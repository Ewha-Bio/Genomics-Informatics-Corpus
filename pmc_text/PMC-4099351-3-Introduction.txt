tRNA Gm18 methyltransferase (TrmH)
To date, 150 modified nucleosides have been identified in RNA, and in tRNA alone 92 such modifications have been recorded [12]. Prominent among those are 2'-OH ribose methylated nucleoside, which is commonly found in tRNAs. The posttranscriptional modification in RNA is mediated through specific methyltransferase enzymes [13]. These modifications can occur in the noncoding region of the RNA sequences. In fact, tRNA contains abundant modified nucleosides, which stabilize the L-shaped tRNA structure and improves their molecular recognition [14]. A conserved guanosine is present at position 18 in the D loop of t-RNA modified to 2'-OH methyl guanosine. This modification stabilizes the L-shaped structure of t-RNA by interacting with pseudouridine 55 [15]. The enzyme TrmH catalyzes the reaction through transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) to the 2'-OH group of the G18 ribose in tRNA D-loops [16]. The TrmH gene in Escherichia coli [17], Thermus thermophilus [18], and Aquifex aeolicus [19] has been identified to have similar catalytic motifs in them. TrmH is subdivided into two classes based on their substrate tRNA specificity. The type I enzymes are involved in the modification of all tRNA species, whereas type II modifies only a subset of tRNA species [20]. The Gm18 modification contributes towards defense reactions during pathogen encounters and has been observed in high frequency both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, including viral RNA [21]. Therefore, a Gm18 modification study gains a significant factor of an infectious microbe, as it acts as a toll-like receptor 7 antagonist [21], and it can be utilized as an anti-inflammatory drug as well [20].
