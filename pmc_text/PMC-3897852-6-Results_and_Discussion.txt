Identification of major mutant genes
In this study, the mutation frequency was analyzed separately in overall, non-metastatic, and metastatic samples. We focused on mutant genes exhibiting high frequency in each sample group. A total of 12, 10, and 15 genes were ranked within the top 3 mutations in at least one of cancer type in the overall, non-metastatic, and metastatic samples, respectively (Table 2). Especially, TP53 and TTN showed dominant frequencies for over 1,000 of all samples.
In addition, the pattern of mutation frequency for the selected major mutant genes was analyzed in diverse cancer categories (Fig. 3). Regardless of sample group, MUC16, TTN, and TP53 were found to be frequent in most cancer types. TP53 is a well-known mutant gene, playing an important role in cancer progression [12, 13]. It was reported that TP53 mutation is frequently represented in major cancer lineages [6]. Mutation TTN and MUC16 has not been reported to be critical in cancers. This analysis shows that they may have potential, specific roles in cancer development or progression.
Among 12 major mutant genes selected from the overall samples, BRAF, FRG1B, PBRM1, and VHL had cancer subtype-specific mutation patterns (Fig. 3A). Especially, PBRM1 and VHL showed strong specificity in KIRC tumors. As previously reported [14], the alterations of VHL (a tumor suppressor gene) are clearly dominant in renal cell carcinoma. Together with VHL, PBRM1 was identified as a major gene, frequently mutated in renal carcinoma [15]. An association with the loss of its expression and renal cell carcinoma progression was suggested in previous studies [16].
