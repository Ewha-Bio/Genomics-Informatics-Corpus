NGS and data analysis
We performed NGS analysis for the DNA samples with the OncoChase-AS cancer panel using an Ion S5 sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw sequence data were analyzed with the Torrent Suite (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The aligner for mapping reads to the reference genome is included in the Torrent Suite [10]. To call variants from the mapped sequence data, we used a plug-in in the Torrent Suite, Torrent Variant Caller (v5.2.2.41). In order to annotate the called variants with the queried knowledge database, we used ANNOVAR [11]. In order to verify variants that were not detected by the Torrent Variant Caller plug-in, we confirmed no-called variants using the Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) program [12] with binary alignment mapping (BAM) format files as raw sequencing data before calling variants [13].
