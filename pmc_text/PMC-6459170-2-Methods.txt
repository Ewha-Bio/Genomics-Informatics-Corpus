Data analysis
scRNA data for breast cancer were downloaded from GSE75688, which contains 549 primary breast cancer cells for 11 patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (BC01, BC02), ER- and HER2-positive (BC03), lymph node metastasis (BC03LN), HER2-positive (BC04, BC05, BC06), triple-negative breast cancer (BC07-BC11), and matched bulk tumors [4]. Data for 11 primary breast cancers, excluding the metastasis sample, were selected (Supplementary Table 1). The reads were aligned to the human reference genome hg19 using STAR 2-pass mode and fragments per kilobase million (FPKM), calculated by RSEM. The cells contained more than 70% unique mapping reads. Genes with an average FPKM of more than 2.5 across all cells were selected, and the average FPKM was more than 4 in the same sample. Finally, in total, 415 cells and 4,269 genes were selected.
