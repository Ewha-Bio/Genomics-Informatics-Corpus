Data processing example of siMacro. One of 3 measures of cell viability against siRNAs targeting 21,115 genes in a non-small cell lung cancer line, H1155 [7], is plotted before data processing (A) and after processing by siMacro (B). Screen capture of the part of an input spread sheet (C) and siMacro ouput (D) are presented.
