Expression levels of NEAT1 in glioblastomas. Datasets obtained from Oncomine demonstrated that GBM significantly expressed high levels of NEAT1 compared to the normal counterparts. (A) Fold change = 5.286, p = 3.18 × 10−14 [46]. (B) Fold change = 4.887, p = 1.15 × 10−11 [47]. NEAT1, nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1; GBM, glioblastomas.
