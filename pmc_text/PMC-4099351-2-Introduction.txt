Insight into tRNA modifications
tRNA is a small chain of nucleotides that decipher the genetic code to protein synthesis on codon and anticodon interactions and has a potential role in DNA repair mechanism tRNA methyltransferase brings changes in the nucleosides in the tRNA structure. Recently, some of these nucleoside modifications have been reported to be involved in the cell response to environmental stress and in the repair of DNA damage as well. In many cases, the posttran-scriptional modification of tRNA has facilitated translation of deviant sense codons [7], and these modifications are essential for tRNA folding function. The amino acyl tRNA synthetase recognizes the cognate tRNA through their structure and chemistry, contributed by modified nucleosides at the anticodon loop [8]. Thus, the modification of stem and loop structures of tRNAs regulates gene expression by ordering conformation and dynamics for recognition of the codon and maintenance of the reading frame. Similarly, mRNAs are programmed to shift their frame when there is no modification in tRNA [8]. In an actively dividing cell, tRNA gene content determines the relative abundance of tRNA isoacceptor, which, in turn, determines codon translation efficiency [9]. The relative abundance of a particular tRNA isoacceptor is kingdom-specific, and enzymes present in the organism increase the translational efficiency of codons through modification in the anticodon wobble base. It implies that the modified enzymes play a major role in the evolution of genomic composition [9]. Methylation reactions account for the majority of posttranscriptional modifications in tRNA [10]. tRNA methyltransferase (Trm) catalyzes the modification along the length of tRNA, including at the anticodon site. Indeed, Trm has a potential and crucial role in enhancing the synthesis of proteins that participate in the damage response [11].
