Detection of donor-specific DNA in kidney recipients' plasma and urine cfDNA samples using dPCR
For the detection of donor-specific DNA variants in cfDNA samples from transplant patients, we finally selected 36 candidate SNPs from three different DNA sources: two SNPs commonly used for sex-determination, 27 autosomal SNPs commonly used for human identification, and seven highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs. As a pilot test, we performed dPCR screening with one SNP from each category, and examined plasma and urine cfDNA samples from a kidney transplant recipient with acute tubular necrosis at day 18 after transplantation. Using any of the three SNPs, we were able to detect circulating donor DNA in urine cfDNA samples, but not in plasma cfDNA samples (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2, limited amounts of donor-specific DNA (0%–0.25% of total DNA) were detected in plasma cfDNA samples, whereas high amounts of donor-specific DNA (56%–74% of total DNA) were detected in urine cfDNA samples using all three SNP markers. Thus, our results indicate that plasma cfDNA is not appropriate for kidney transplant monitoring, but urine is a very good source of cfDNA for monitoring kidney transplant patients. Furthermore, using the sex-specific and autosomal SNPs led to identification of a very similar percentage of donor-specific DNA (57% vs. 56%). On the other hand, a higher percentage of donor-specific DNA (74%) was detected using the mtDNA SNP as a marker (Fig. 2). We also observed a strong correlation between the mtDNA and nuclear DNA SNPs (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = 0.57–0.83) as well as between sex-specific and autosomal SNPs (r = 0.90, p = 0.0007) in a comparison of multiple sample tests (Fig. 3). These results indicate that dPCR can be useful for SNP-based detection of donor DNA in the urine of kidney recipients following transplantation.
