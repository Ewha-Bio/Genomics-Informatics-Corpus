SNP association with drug response or resistance
Drug resistance was defined as the occurrence of at least four seizures over the year before recruitment, with trials of more than three appropriate AED, at maximal tolerated doses, based on the occurrence of clinical side effects at supra-maximal doses [25]. The patients were classified as either responsive or resistant to drug therapy. We did not find any significant associations between the selected drug transporter SNPs and either group.
