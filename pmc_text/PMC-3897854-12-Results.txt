Relationship between genotypes of MRP2 and CNS ADRs to VPA
Allele frequencies of the MRP2 polymorphisms are shown in Table 2. Non-ADR patients were more likely to have the deletion allele instead of the G allele at g.-1774 when compared with patients with CNS ADRs (p = 0.0057; ADR, 20.7%; non-ADR, 37.3%). The frequency of the T allele at g.-24 was higher in patients with CNS ADRs than those without (p = 0.0274; ADR, 34.1%; non-ADR, 22.0%). The difference between the groups based on g.-24C > T frequencies was not significant after Bonferroni's correction, while the difference based on g.-1774delG frequencies remained significant.
The genotype frequencies of each polymorphism are shown in Table 3. Genotype frequency distributions were consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (each p > 0.5). The ADR group patients were more likely to have a GG genotype than a deldel genotype at g.-1774delG compared to the non-ADR group (p = 0.023, homo GG and deldel p = 0.0146). The TT and CT genotype frequencies at g.-24C > T were higher in patients with CNS ADRs than non-ADR patients (p = 0.035, hetero CT â†’ TT p = 0.019).
The frequencies of haplotypes present in at least 10% of the population are presented in Table 4. Haplotype frequencies of the MRP2 polymorphisms at all site. The frequency of haplotype 1 was significantly higher in patients without CNS ADRs (32.3%) than those with ADRs (15.8%) (p = 0.0039). The frequency of haplotype 3 was higher in patients with CNS ADRs than those without (p = 0.0139), but this difference was no longer significant after Bonferroni's correction was applied.
