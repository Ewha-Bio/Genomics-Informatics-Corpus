As a test set, the direct lethality dataset from 21,125 sets of siRNA oligos in a non-small cell lung cancer line, H1155 [7], was used. From raw data for cell viability (Fig. 1A), it was evident that there was a row effect and day-to-day variation in transfection efficiency as well as sporadic technical outliers due to contamination (e.g., T1Raw of siCATSPER in Fig. 1C). With the default 1% highest CV filter and row-median normalization, siMacro censored, normalized, and standardized the dataset (Fig. 1B and 1D). siMacro has been developed for but is not limited to cell-based genomewide siRNA screens.
