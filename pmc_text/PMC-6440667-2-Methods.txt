Study population
We retrospectively used the Gene-Environmental Interaction and Phenotype (GENIE) database for Koreans; these data were collected from 10,349 healthy individuals who visited Seoul National University Hospital Gangnam Center for a comprehensive health check-up and consented to have their specimens included in a biospecimen repository. The program for comprehensive health check-ups and the GENIE database is described in another paper [26]. Briefly, blood pressure, waist circumference, height, and weight information were collected through anthropometric measurements during a health screening, and information on age, smoking, alcohol, exercise, and drug use was collected through interviews. After at least 10 hours of fasting, peripheral blood samples were obtained from all patients to determine the levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipopolysaccharide (HDL) cholesterol, and DNA samples were collected from the remaining blood. SNP genotyping was performed by an Affymetrix Axiom KORV1.1-96 Array (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at DNA Link Inc. (Seoul, Korea).
