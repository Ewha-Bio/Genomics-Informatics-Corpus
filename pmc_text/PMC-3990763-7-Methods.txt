Interactive exploration
Mapping property
Rich graphical attributes are employed to provide clinical and background properties of the patients. The attributes are carefully selected based on the feedback from the medical analysts. The mapping property and items can be easily adjusted, filtered (or hidden), and/or re-mapped to different attributes (e.g., patient background and biomedical information) via interactive menus to suit the preferences and new requirements. The mapping options are label, axes, colors, size, shapes, and visual bars.
Filtering
From the visualization, users can interactively filter out uninteresting patients to enhance the view of the associated data. Filtering can be applied to all categorical and quantitative attributes through interactive menus. The filtering allows the researcher/clinician (domain expert) to extract, picture, and interrogate specific features for the patients selected within the similarity space.
Fig. 4 illustrates the view at a navigational stage showing all medium-risk patients only. Patient identifications are also displayed in this example. The figure highlights three patients with similar clinical presentations, such as they were all stratified as medium risk (MR) (blue color), but having diverse outcomes. These patients were managed on the two treatment protocols BFM95 (larger size, ALL48) and Study 8 (smaller size, ALL134 and ALL323). With the patients placed into a similarity space based on genetic data, we have applied further computational methods to extract, visualize, and compare data from the chosen patients. By looking at the figure, we can quickly see that ALL323 is located at the top-left, while the other two patients are positioned closely together at a distance from the first patient. This observation indicates that the two surviving patients ALL48 and ALL134 are genetically similar and that they are genetically different from the deceased patient, ALL323.
