Comparison of three different types of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (autosomal, mitochondrial, or sex-specific) as markers for quantification of donor DNA in kidney transplant recipients' urine. The correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for pairwise comparisons of the donor DNA percentages estimated using the three markers, with the autosomal versus the sex-specific SNP shown (A), the autosomal versus the mitochondrial SNP shown (B), and the sex-specific versus the mitochondrial SNP shown (C).
