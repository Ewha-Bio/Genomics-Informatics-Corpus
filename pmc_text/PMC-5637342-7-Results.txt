Merged panel can improve performance
To compare the imputation accuracy of different panels, we used the 61 HapMap Asian samples from Beijing, China (CHB) and Tokyo, Japan (JPT) as benchmark data [11]. We masked the HLA information of these individuals, imputed them, and compared the imputed genotypes to the true genotypes. We evaluated three panels: the Pan-Asian panel, the Korean panel, and the merged panel of the two. The merged panel achieved an average 4-digit accuracy of six HLA genes of 93.8%, whereas the Pan-Asian and Korean panels had 85.4% and 91.5% accuracy rates, respectively (Fig. 2). The per-HLA gene accuracies are described in Table 1. The performance of the merged panel was equal or superior to that of the individual panels for all HLA genes. The improvement in performance was notable for HLA-DRB1 (Pan-Asian, 85.2%; Korean, 89.3%; merged, 95.1%).
