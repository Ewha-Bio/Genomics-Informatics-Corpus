The tetraspanins
Tetraspanins (TM4SFs) have four transmembrane protein domains with two extracellular loops and one intracellular loop (ICL) and the N- and C-terminal tails [54]. They are expressed on the cell surface and/or intracellular vesicles and contain 33 members in mammals [55]. Tetraspanins, or TM4SFs, are suggested to be located at tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TERMs) [56], where they form protein-protein complexes in a homophilic or heterophilic manner with other TM4SFs, integrins, or growth factor receptors [57, 58]. The protein complexes are known to regulate the dynamics of the complex components on the cell surface with regard to diffusion, trafficking, retention, and stability, in addition to influencing intracellular signal transductions [56, 59, 60].
