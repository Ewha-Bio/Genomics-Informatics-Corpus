Total RNA isolation and cDNA syntheses
Total RNA was extracted from ten tissues of olive flounder (spleen, gill, muscle, kidney, intestine, stomach, liver, fin, brain, and testis) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) depending on the manufacturer’s instructions. These RNAs were treated with RNase-Free DNase I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) to remove genomic DNA contamination. RNAs were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis for analysis of the 28S and 18S RNA bands. The RNA concentration was quantified to 500 ng using a ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Nano Drop, Wilmington, DE, USA). ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix kit (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) was used for cDNA synthesis. Prior to use, a 1 in 50 volume of gDNA remover was added to 4× DN Master Mix and then each quantitated 500 ng RNA samples 6 μL denatured at 65℃ for 5 min. Then, 2 μL of 4× DN Master Mix was added to RNA in order to increase DNase I reaction and incubated at 37℃ for 5 min. After that, 2 μL of 5× RT Master Mix was added to 4× DN Master Mix. Reverse transcription response was performed by following steps; incubation at 37℃ for 15 min, 50℃ for 5 min, heating 98℃ for 5 min and stored the solutions at ‒20℃.
