Strains
The sequences of 76 strains were downloaded from the NCBI site. Details regarding genome sizes, %GC content, the number of encoded proteins, encoded genes, genome type, pathotype, serotype, other characteristics, and accession numbers are summarized in Table 1. Most data presented were extracted from NCBI GenBank and UniProt Bank and some information was extracted from original articles [1415]. The genomes of 24 strains were drafted, and a reordering process of the draft genomes was performed. Twenty-five CDT+ E. coli strains were analyzed, including E. albertii TW07627.
