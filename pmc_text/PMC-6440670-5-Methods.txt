Ligation of DNA fragments in an ordered manner
Using a DNA fragment with a restriction site, a data block is to be further ligated in an ordered manner to form a longer DNA fragment. In our study, two DNA fragments with sizes of about 800â€’1,000 bp will be cut with restriction enzymes to form a common ligation site. SpeI and XbarI are used for the first and second fragments, respectively. Fig. 4 describes this step, and the details of the restriction and ligation conditions follow.
