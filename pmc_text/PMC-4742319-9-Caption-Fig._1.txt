Conflict between most molecular studies based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences (concatenated twelve protein coding sequences: ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, COI, COII, COIII, Cytb, ATPase 6, and ATPase 8) (left) and the mixture of several molecular loci (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA) (right) with regard to crocodilian phylogeny, divergence time, and karyological data. The majority-rule tree with interval node ages from the *BEAST posterior sample is conducted based on a conservative upper bound of 100 million year ago (MYA), placed on the root of Crocodylia (83.5~96.5 MYA) and on the divergence of Alligator-Caiman (64~71 MYA) [1, 18] (left image). The phylogenetic tree within Crocodylia was obtained from Oaks [16] with slight modification (right image). Karyological data were obtained from Cohen and Gans [19], Olmo and Signorio [20], Kawagoshi et al. [21], Srikulnath et al. [22], and Kasai et al. [23]. Estimated divergence times at individual nodes are shown with their interval ages. Crocodylus siamensis (1), complete mitochondrial genome of C. siamensis (DQ353946) sequenced by Ji et al. [24]; Crocodylus siamensis (2), complete mitochondrial genome of C. siamensis (EF581859) sequenced by Srikulnath et al. [17]. ?, no data on chromosome constitution; NF, fundamental number. In Crocodylus lineage, Indo-Pacific species is Crocodylus mindorensis, Crocodylus novaeguineae, Crocodylus johnstoni, Crocodylus siamensis, Crocodylus palustris, and Crocodylus porosus; New World species is Crocodylus moreletii, Crocodylus acutus, Crocodylus intermedius, and Crocodylus rhombifer; and African species is Crocodylus niloticus.
