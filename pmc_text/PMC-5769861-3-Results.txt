Workflow
Fig. 1 shows a graphical overview of the pre-analysis steps and the IVAG workflow. The blue line (Fig. 1A) denotes a schematic representation of the external pipelines required for RNA-seq and GWAS data. These parts are prerequisites for downstream analyses prior to IVAG analysis. The red box in the right panel (Fig. 1B) illustrates the IVAG workflow. The orange items are input files for IVAG, and their detailed formats are described in Supplementary Figs. 1â€“29.
