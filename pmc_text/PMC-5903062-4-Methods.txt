HSF estimation via simulation
To estimate HSF, we simulated the average substitution rate of SNP chip data. We assumed the SNP number of general SNP chip data. The SNP chip data have 30,000‒50,000 SNPs in total, and the founder number can be assumed to be close to “1.” We simulated using the following parameters: the number of SNPs would be 30,000‒50,000 and the harmonic number of sample size would be 4‒6. Using Eq. (1), the expected value of the substitution rate was 3 × 10-10 to 5 × 10-10 (/bp/y). Using the result, we set the average substitution rate to be 4 × 10-10. This was a similar result to Roach et al. [22] who estimated the average mutation rate of human as 10-8 order per generation.
The HSF of Hanwoo and Holstein was estimated using Eq. (1). The evolutionary distances of the Hanwoo and Holstein population across chromosomes were calculated and then average HSF of Hanwoo (23 individuals) and Holstein (10 individuals) were estimated using the substitution rates of each chromosome.
