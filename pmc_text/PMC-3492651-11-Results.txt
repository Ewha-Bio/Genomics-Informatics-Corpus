KDO regulated activators and repressors of immune signaling
After classifying the genes by KMC, we subcategorized them according to their functions. KDO-regulated genes included transcription factors and genes involved in inflammation, immune responses, signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, transport, cell adhesion, and apoptosis (Supplementary Table 1). As expected, KDO-treated cells exhibited a gene regulation pattern similar to that in LPS-treated cells, which included upregulation of Tnf, Il-1α, Il-1β, Cxcl4, and c-Myc. Furthermore, we also observed that KDO regulated several immediate early response genes, such as Egr1, Egr3, Gadd45α, Dusp1, and Dusp2, all of which are reportedly upregulated by LPS [11]. Our results indicated that KDO elicits transcriptional responses that are similar in gene identity and potency to LPS responses.
During the KDO-mediated transcriptional response in RAW 264.7 cells, many of the genes induced at 120 min were candidate feedback repressors of signal transduction [17]. Such repressors were specific to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and Il-1 and include nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor epsilon (Nfκbie, also known as IκBε), nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor zeta (Nfκbiζ, also known as Iκbζ), and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (Il-1ra). In addition, KDO upregulated Tnfsf9, Tnfaip3, Traf1, and Fas6, indicating that KDO has the potential to elicit inflammation. Its upregulation of Irf1 suggested that KDO also activated interferon-stimulated response elements through the MyD88-independent pathway.
Other KDO-induced genes included IFN-β, CD40, Socs5, Cish, Fosl1, Rgs16, CCR9, Ifit3, and cardiotropin 1 (Ctf1). Among these genes, Socs5 and Cish are feedback inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway; both were upregulated after 120 min of stimulation. KDO also promoted Il-10 expression after 120 min of stimulation; this gene contains 2 Creb binding sites in its promoter; so, KDO may have upregulated this gene through enhanced phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT)-glycogen syntase kinase (GSK) pathway signaling and Creb phosphorylation.
