Gene expression profiling
Total RNA was prepared from lung type II cells by using the Qiagen Rneasy kit (Valencia, CA, USA). For cDNA synthesis, RNA (10 μg) was annealed to the oligodT-T7 promoter at 70℃ for 10 min and then reverse transcribed at 42℃ for 3 h. The resulting double-stranded cDNA was used as a template to generate biotinylated cRNA from an in vitro transcription reaction using the Enzo Diagnostics RNA transcript labeling kit (Farmindale, NY, USA). The biotin-labeled cRNA were purified and hybridized to the murine U74A genomic array as directed by Affymetrix technical procedures manual (http://www.affymetrix.com). The washed arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-streptavidin and scanned by using an Affymetrix Gene-array scanner. The experiment was performed with RNA from lung type II cells pooled from 3 animals each for a chip and a total of 4 chips were used with similar results.
