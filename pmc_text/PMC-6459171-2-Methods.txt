Animals and primary alveolar type II cell preparation
BALB/c mice (5–7 weeks old) were used. All experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee. Lung primary alveolar type II cells were prepared as described [7,21]. Briefly, lungs from BALB/c mice were dissected and put in a sterile culture tube containing serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and dispase and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Lungs were then transferred to a culture dish containing DNAse1 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and the tissue gently teased away from the airways. The cell suspension was successively filtered and then pelleted. Crude cell suspensions were added to culture dishes coated with anti-CD45 and anti-CD32 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated for 1–2 h. Culture dishes were removed from the incubator, gently rocked to free settled type II cells and then resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Purity of the type II cell preparations 3 used for these studies was greater than 95% by morphological, immunocytochemical, and reverse transcriptase PCR assays of selected cell-specific markers criteria.
