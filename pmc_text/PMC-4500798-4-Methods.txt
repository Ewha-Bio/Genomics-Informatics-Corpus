Prediction of duplex between miRNAs and mRNA of the HOXA9 gene
A computational approach was carried out to study the binding mode of selected miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) with the mRNA of HOXA9 to confirm the selection of the best miRNA. The properties, like predicted binding sites of HOXA9 for miRNAs (Supplementary Table 3) and minimum free energy (MFE) score of duplex interactions, were used for confirmation of binding. Two different duplexes were formed for mir-196b (represented as mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2) with HOXA9 due to the identification of two target sites in HOXA9 (Supplementary Table 3). The MFE scores for folding of miRNAs and the mRNA duplex (Supplementary Table 4) were calculated using the mfold web server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold). The appropriate secondary structures of miRNAs and the mRNA duplex (Supplementary Table 4) were predicted using the Centroid Fold web server (http://www.ncrna.org/centroidfold/). The prediction of tertiary structures of the duplex were performed in 3dRNA web server (http://biophy. hust.edu.cn/3dRNA/3dRNA.html) using dot bracket structures (Supplementary Table 4) that resulted from the Centroid Fold.
