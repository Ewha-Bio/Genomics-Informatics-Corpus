Regional association plot of the most significant loci associated with medication adherence. Purple circle indicates the strongest association (rs6978712) detected in the genome-wide analysis. Other circles indicate SNPs genotyped in this study, and their color reflects the linkage disequilibrium (r2) with rs6978712. The blue line represents the recombination rates in the 1000 Genome Mar 2012 ASN population. SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms; ASN, super population of the east Asian, which includes Han Chinese in Beijing, China; Japanese in Tokyo, Japan; Southern Han Chinese; Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China; and Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
