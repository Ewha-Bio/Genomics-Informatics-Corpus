nc886 has been given several names, including vtRNA2-1, CBL3, and pre-miR-886. vtRNA2-1 is currently its official name and stands for vault RNA 2-1 [6]. The vault RNAs (vtRNAs) are the RNA components in the vault complex, a large ribonucleoprotein particle whose precise function has not been elucidated yet (reviewed in Berger et al. [7]). In the human genome, there are three canonical vtRNA genes, vtRNA1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. nc886 was thought to be a vtRNA paralog because of sequence homology and therefore was named vtRNA2-1 [6]. However, nc886 is less similar in sequence to canonical vtRNAs than they are similar to each other [5]. Furthermore, nc886 is neither in physical association with the vault complex nor necessary for the integrity of the complex [5]. nc886 is functionally distinct from vtRNA1-1 [458910].
Another alias for nc886, CBL3, stands for cord blood lymphocyte (CBL)-derived ncRNA 3. This name originated from the fact that nc886 was one of the most induced ncRNAs when CBL was infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [11]. Interestingly, canonical vtRNAs were also induced by EBV, which also contributed to the early misconception of nc886 as a vtRNA [12].
In addition, nc886 was once classified as a miRNA precursor and so was registered in the miRNA database (miRBase: http://www.mirbase.org/) [13]. This was due to the high sensitivity of the next-generation sequencing technologies, together with the high intracellular expression level of nc886 but its short half-life [5]. Thus, its degradation products are continuously produced at a quantity high enough to be captured by small RNA sequencing. According to the deepBase (http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/) where small RNA sequencing data were collected and displayed [14], the nc886 sequence was captured at significantly higher frequency than most other genomic regions. In addition, 20-30 nucleotides at the 5'- and 3'-end of nc886 were captured more prominently than its middle portion. This sequencing pattern misinterpreted as each end corresponding to mature miR-886-5p and -3p respectively. However, our extensive analysis proved that it is not a miRNA precursor. First and foremost, nc886 appears as a single band at 101 nucleotides (nts) in Northern hybridization [458910]. Second, the biogenesis of nc886 is dissimilar to that of miRNAs; nc886 is neither processed from Drosha cleavage nor diced into mature miRNAs by Dicer [5]. Third, there is no inverse correlation in expression between nc886 and the predicted target genes of miR-886-5p or -3p, which is against our expectation if nc886 would to produce functional mature miRNAs [5].
Since nc886 does not produce a miRNA precursor nor is in the vault complex, its aliases pre-miR-886 and vtRNA2-1 are misleading. Therefore, our research group renamed it non-coding 886 (nc886) [4] and this name will be used throughout the review.
