Two SNPs, rs7747752 and rs7767391, were found to have the strongest association. They are located in an intron of the cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5 (CDK5) regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1 (CDKAL1) gene located in chromosome 6. This gene has been reported to make contributions to type II diabetes. Both of the SNPs identified in this paper have been also reported to have susceptibility to type II diabetes [14151617]. Note that among the second-tier SNPs—rs2328549 and rs17487711—only the first one is in the intron of CDKAL1 [18]. rs17487711 has been newly identified to have strong association comparable with that of rs2328549, while it is located in the intron of LOC-105379297 in chromosome 8. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) still describes this gene as uncharacterized. In Table 2, 3 out of 4 among third-tier SNPS have been listed to be in the intron of ATPase, class II, type 9B (ATP9B) located in chromosome 18 [19], whereas rs9465871 can be found in the intron of CDKAL1 [202122].
A single prominent pair (rs2328549, rs6486740) revealed itself. In Table 3, detailed information is provided for the top 5 pairs. One of the SNPs in the pair that showed the strongest association, rs6486740, is located in an intron of the glycosyltransferase 1 domain-containing 1 (GLT1D1) gene on chromosome 12, while the other SNP, rs2328549, is located in an intron of CDKAL1, which was mentioned in the previous subsection. GLT1D1 was reported to be related with renal sinus fat [23] and the transfers of glycosyl groups [24]. Among the second-tier SNP pairs, rs7029094 and rs1995761 are located on chromosome 9, but there exists little information about the gene in which they are located.
