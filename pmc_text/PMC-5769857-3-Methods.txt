Generation of pharmacophore model
Ligandscout tools 4.1 [17] was used to generate the ligand-based pharmacophore models. Ligandscout is known to be able to increase the selectivity of a pharmacophore model with the excluded volume feature. To generate more flexible pharmacophore, the threshold of the portion of partially matching features was set to 20%.
