Figure description
Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of our analysis. It explains the procedure of the TC calculation. The gene effect was calculated using GWAS and TC was calculated using gene effect and TPM. As shown in Eq. (2), the TC unit in our analysis is BF%. Fig. 2 shows the plot of TPM and GWAS beta effect. The genes with a higher TPM had a smaller beta effect across the board. According to Eq. (2), a higher TPM and a smaller beta effect would show a smaller TC. Fig. 3 shows the Manhattan plot of â€“log10(p-value) and the TC across chromosomes. The p-value was from GWAS results and TC was calculated as shown in Fig. 1.
