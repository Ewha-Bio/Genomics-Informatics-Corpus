Web construction
Our web-based system includes the traditional taxonomy (order, family, subfamily, genus, and species), as well as the information regarding strain and isolate. Furthermore, users can easily access journals containing information related to the published virus GenBank via the EMBL RESTful protocol [6] and directly download and reuse NCBI FASTA and “gbk” file via the Entrez openAPI [7]. However, the information of the chosen PubMed and strain and isolate are based on NCBI accession in (Table 3). The journal search is connected by the parameters of the HTML get method, which is indicated by the PubMed ID. Web scraping methods were used to build the “ICTV history” table in our database after extracting meaningful information from the NCBI raw data. The tables in our database form the foundation of the web system. In the Spring framework, the web system consists of Java, which is independent of the operating system. According to the user commands, the internal parsing process is executed by pipelines that are implemented by the BioPython module. The internal parsing process extracts the information of the virus taxonomy, history, and reference articles from XML data, which are produced by the EMBL RESTful API, and text files of the NCBI virus GenBank. The overall process map for the web system is described in Fig. 2.
