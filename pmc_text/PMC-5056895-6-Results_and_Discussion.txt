The NS3 protein (accession No. YP_009227202) of ZIKV has 617 amino acids residues and NS3 protein of DENV (accession No. NP_740321.1) has 618 amino acid residues in its protein sequence. The NS3 protein of both ZIKV and DENV have structurally similar with three conserve domain, i.e., FLAVIVIRUS_NS3PRO, Flavivirus NS3 protease (NS3pro) domain; HELICASE_ATP_BIND_1, superfamilies 1 and 2 helicase ATP-binding type-1 domain; and HELICASE_CTER, superfamilies 1 and 2 helicase C-terminal domain (predicted from ScanProsite tool of ExPASy) [33]; however, there are 67% identities and 100% similarities in their amino acid sequences obtained from BLASTP result [34].
