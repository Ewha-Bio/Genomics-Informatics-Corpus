Identification of hypermethylated and downregulated genes
The discovery dataset was used for gene selection. Illumina Infinium Human DNA Methylation27 level 2 data were screened for differentially methylated regions (DMRs), where the median M of the tumor samples was greater than +1 and that of the matched normal samples was less than -1 [9]. For each gene, the mean mRNA expression level in tumor samples was compared to that in normal samples. Genes showing at least 4-fold down-regulation were selected. DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) was used for the functional annotation of the gene list.
