We have constructed the KCGD system, a web-based search platform, to assist investigators in estimating predictive value of interested genes and in identifying molecular signatures from Korean cancer genomics data. As an initial repository with the aim of Korean-specific marker detection, KCGD always open to collaborate with any research investigators or clinicians in Korea and is ready to share Korean cancer genomics data with clinical information to solve the critical problems in the biomedical fields. KCGD is a growing database: although current database mainly contains gene expression with clinical data, the database is ready to handle the RNA-seq data, another gene expression profiling method, or any continuous numeric intensity data (i.e., methylation or genomic variation). In addition, for direct comparative genomic analysis with non-Korean data, we are trying to collect other genomic or epigenomic data from several public database including the Cancer Genome Atlas consortium and comparative browsing would be implemented in near future. Therefore, we suggest that KCGD may be one of the best choice as a co-work partner when users try to discover significant novel factors associated with genomic studies of Korean cancer patients.
