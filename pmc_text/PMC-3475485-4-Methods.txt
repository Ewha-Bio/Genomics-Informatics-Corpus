DNA microarray scanning and analysis
Microarrays were scanned using an Arraywox scanner (Applied Precision, Seattle, WA, USA), analyzed using ImaGene version 5.1 software (Biodiscovery, Segundo, CA, USA), and normalized using Genesight version 3.2 software (Biodiscovery). Normalization was performed by subtracting the means of all genes. The data normalized by Genesight were compared using an M/A plot. Genes differentially expressed were identified by intensity differences, after subtracting the background intensity. Genes showing expression changes of at least 2-fold were selected, and these selected genes were clustered by the hierarchical method.
