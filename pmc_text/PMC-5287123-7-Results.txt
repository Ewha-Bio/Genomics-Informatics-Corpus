Analysis of ovarian cancer DNA methylation data
Next, we applied four statistical methods to real ovarian cancer DNA methylation data. Ovarian cancer DNA methylation data generated from Illumina Infinium Human-Methylation27K Beadchip has been already applied to identify CpG sites and genes associated with ovarian cancer from some different studies [192021]. The methylation data set consists of 20,461 CpG sites from 12,770 genes with 152 controls and 119 cases. Many genes have either one or two CpG sites and some genes have up to 9 CpG sites. Since our four statistical methods can be applied to genomic data with a group structure, and our main goal of this study is to compare group testing procedures with group selection procedure, we excluded genes that have only one CpG site in the analysis. So, we ended up with 14,627 CpG sites from 6,936 genes which have at least two CpG sites.
In the exactly same way used in the simulation studies, we identified top 20 genes for each method. Table 1 shows the top 20 genes and their p-values computed by PCA and Hotelling's T2 test. Also, 20 selected genes by group lasso procedure are included in the table. For the permutation test, we permuted the data over 1,000,000 times, but we found that the empirical p-values of 246 genes are still less than 10â€“7. Due to time limit, we cannot reduce down the number of genes in the top list of permutation test anymore. Therefore, we had to finalize with top 246 genes detected by permutation test. For each statistical method, Fig. 4 summarizes the number of overlapped genes among top 20 genes by the other three methods.
In Fig. 4, it appears that 15 genes in the top 20 list of PCA is also in the top 20 list of Hotelling's T2 test, while only 2 genes in the top 20 list of PCA is in the top 20 list of group lasso. Similarly, we can see that only 3 genes in the top 20 list of Hotelling's T2 test is in the top 20 list of group lasso. Top 246 genes detected by permutation test include all of the 20 genes detected by both PCA and Hotelling's T2 test, but only 7 genes among the 246 genes are overlapped with top 20 genes selected by group lasso. This result indicates that genes selected by group lasso are quite different from genes detected by three group testing procedures.
Next, we identified top 246 genes by each of four different statistical methods since the minimum number of genes detected by permutation test is 246. Fig. 5 summarizes the number of overlapped genes among 246 genes by the other three methods. It seems that three group testing procedures of PCA, Hotelling's T2 test and permutation test have from 164 (66.67%) to 205 (83.73%) overlapped genes with each other. In contrast, group lasso selection procedure have only 24 (9.76%) to 31 (12.60%) overlapped genes with three group testing procedures. In this result, we can conclude that most of genes selected by group lasso are very different from genes detected by multiple group testing procedures in high-dimensional DNA methlyation data analysis.
In the first simulation study three group testing procedures and group lasso selection procedure show very similar selection performance. However, selection performance of four methods was quite different from each other in the second simulation study. We demonstrated that true positive selection could vary on the number of causal sites and the noise level. In analysis of ovarian cancer DNA methylation data, we found that group lasso identified quite different genes, compared with three group testing procedures. In general, regularization procedures like group lasso are known as a good alternative method to testing procedures when we identify disease or trait associated genes with high-dimensional genomic data, where the number of genes far exceeds the number of samples. However, our investigation found that many genes selected by group lasso are rarely overlapped with genes detected by three group testing procedures, which detected many overlapped genes. The similar situation was observed when the number of causal sites is small and the noise level is relatively large in our second simulation study. In that case, true positive rates of group lasso are much higher than those of three group testing procedures, where three testing procedures shows the almost same selection performance. In real DNA methylation data multiple genes are usually highly correlated with each other. Moreover, the number of causal sites could be small and the noise level could be large. But, further biological investigation with genes selected by group lasso should be conducted to figure out the main reason of this big discrepancy between group lasso and group tests in analysis of DNA methylation data.
