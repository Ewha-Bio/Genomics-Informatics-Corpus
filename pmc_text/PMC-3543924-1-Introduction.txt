Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as abnormal glucose tolerance that is first identified or diagnosed during pregnancy [1]. It is estimated that approximately 2% to 5% of all pregnancies in Korean women are complicated by GDM [2]. The clinical significance of GDM is that it increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [3]. In a recent large-scale multinational prospective study, increased maternal glucose concentration during pregnancy was significantly associated with increased neonatal birth weight, primary cesarean delivery, neonatal hypoglycemia, and increased placental C-peptide levels [4]. After parturition, about 15% of GDM women had persistent diabetes at an early postpartum period of 2 months [5]. GDM is also reported to recur at a frequency of 45% in subsequent pregnancies [6]. Women with a previous history of GDM are at increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The risk of T2DM is 3.5 times greater in women with a history of GDM compared to the general population in Koreans [7]. In addition, offspring of GDM women are also at risk of developing obesity and T2DM [8]. The incidence of GDM is expected to rise, as it will parallel the increasing rate of obesity and T2DM. Furthermore, the recent recommendation from the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group has lowered the diagnostic threshold of GDM and is expected to increase the incidence of GDM [9].
