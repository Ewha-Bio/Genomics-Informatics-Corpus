Quantile-quantile (QQ) plot and Manhattan plot of genome-wide association study (GWAS) for medication adherence. (A) QQ plot shows the differences between the observed and expected -log10 (p-value) of the study results. The red line indicates the expected distributions under the null hypothesis. The gray shaded region represents the 95% confidence interval. (B) Manhattan plot of single nucleotide polymorphisms for medication adherence. X-axis represents chromosomes. Y-axis represents -log10 (p-values) obtained by genome-wide association analysis. The red line indicates the suggestive threshold for genome-wide significance (p < 1 Ã— 10-5).
