Equality of IVW and SZ under certain assumptions
Analytical derivation
Here, we show that the two methods IVW and SZ are equivalent under certain assumptions. We have shown that IVW is optimal in the sense that the estimator is MLE and achieves minimum variance, and SZ is optimal in the sense that it maximizes the non-centrality parameter. Although both methods can be considered optimal, their goals and how they are optimized are completely different; IVW aims to obtain the best summary estimate (thus MLE and minimum variance), and SZ aims to maximize the statistical power, without considering the summary estimator. Despite the fact that the two methods are optimized differently with different goals, we show that the resulting statistics are equivalent, in the sense that their z-scores (and therefore their p-values) are equivalent. Again, we assume the definition of z-score Zi=XiVi, which is assumed in Eq. (18). We assume that SZ uses SE(Xi)−1 as weights for z-scores, rather than only using sample sizes.
Then, we can show, by simple algebra: ZSZ=∑iSEXi−1Zi∑iSEXi−2=∑iWiXi∑iWi=ZIVW, (14) which demonstrates that the two methods are exactly equivalent if we use SE(Xi)−1 as weights for SZ.
Empirical simulation
To empirically investigate the equality of IVW and SZ, we compared the power of the two methods. We assumed the following null and alternative hypotheses:
H0:µ = 0
H1:µ ≠ 0
That is, we tested if the mean effect is non-zero.
To generate simulation sets of meta-analysis studies, we used the common simulation framework for simulating genetic association studies. We assumed that there is a single SNP whose minor allele confers risk of a disease, which is a dichotomous trait. We assumed a number of different relative risks, γ=PdiseaseSNPminorPdiseaseSNPminor, ranging from 1.01 to 1.2. We assumed a meta-analysis of 5 genetic association studies and assumed a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.3. In an additional simulation setting, we assumed varying MAFs of (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5) for the 5 studies. We assumed a very small disease prevalence (F ≈ 0). Given these assumptions and parameters, we can calculate the expected MAF in cases and in controls. Specifically, given MAF p and relative risk γ, the case MAF becomes γp/((γ−1)p + 1), where the control MAF becomes approximately p, given F ≈ 0. Given the expected MAF in cases and controls, we could randomly sample genotype data, assuming 500 cases and 500 controls for each of the five studies. To assess the statistical significance of the sample data, we used log odds ratio as a statistic, which follows an asymptotic normal distribution. We repeated the procedure to generate 100,000 simulated meta-analysis sets. Given the significance level α = 0.05, the power was the proportion of sample sets whose meta-analysis p-value was ≤α.
We compared the two methods—IVW and weighted SZ—using the inverse standard error as a weight factor (SZ_SE). Fig. 1 shows that the two methods showed the same power in both situations: under no heterogeneity in MAF between studies (Fig. 1A) and under heterogeneity in MAF (Fig. 1B). This result complements our analytical results that the two methods are equivalent if SZ uses SE(Xi)−1 as weights.
Additionally, we compared the two methods with another method, the weighted SZ, which uses the inverse squared root sample size as the weight (SZ_N). SZ_N was equivalent to IVW and SZ_SE in terms of power, when there was no heterogeneity in MAF (Fig. 1A). However, with the existence of differences in allele frequencies (therefore, differences in weights, wIVW,i ≠ wSZ_N,i), SZ_N showed a slight power loss from the other two methods (Fig. 1B). This result demonstrates that using only sample size as the weight can be suboptimal if there are other factors that can cause variance differences between studies, such as allele frequencies. Nevertheless, the power drop of using only sample size as the weight was quite small (i.e., at γ = 1.15, the power of IVW and SZ_SE was 58.24%, but the power of SZ_N was 57.23%, with only 1.01% power loss.)
