Sailfish is unique software adopting an alignment-free approach for isoform quantification. An index is built from a set of reference transcripts and a specific choice of k-mer length, which consists of data structures that maps each k-mer in the reference transcripts to a unique integer identifier, enabling to count k-mers in a set of reads and to resolve their origin in the set of transcripts. Until the set of reference transcripts or the k-mer length is changed, it is not necessary to rebuild the index. Sailfish computes an estimate of the relative abundance of each transcript in the reference by employing an EM algorithm similar to that used in RSEM. Because Sailfish avoids read alignment entirely, the running time for quantification is much lower than for other existing methods. Sailfish reports terms of abundance measures, including (1) RPKM, (2) k-mers per kilobase per million mapped k-mers (KPKM), and (3) TPM.
We described four programs, RSEM, Cufflinks, StringTie, and Sailfish in detail. In addition to the use of specific algorithm, a major difference between these programs may be the reference type used. A set of transcript sequences is used as a reference in RSEM and Sailfish, indicating that the programs may be suitable for estimating the abundance of known transcripts. In contrast, a reference genome is employed in Cufflinks and StringTie, making it possible to present the estimated abundance of novel transcripts as well as already known transcripts, as spliced read mapping data can reveal known and novel splice junction information simultaneously.
