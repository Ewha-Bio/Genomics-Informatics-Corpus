Consistency verification for Caliciviridae
First of all, in order to verify consistency for whether the virus taxonomy named by ICTV was well classified or not, we compared all RefSeq sequences belonging to Caliciviridae by pairwise alignment sequence comparison (PASC) analysis [5], which provides assistance to search the sequences of the high similarity after pairwise comparing each complete genome in the genus level of Caliciviridae based on ICTV taxonomy, and by BLAST-based alignment method (blastn: nucleotide comparison). The NCBI RefSeq genomes of Caliciviridae exhibited a high homology by the PASC analysis were adequately matched to the classification defined by ICTV taxonomy. However, “NC_006875.1” showed the high similarity for Nebovirus (Table 2). It is consistent with the contention that “NC_006875.1” should be classified to Nebovirus [5].
It is necessary to extract protein sequences from the region where gene expression appears. The extracted protein sequence can be split to open reading frames (ORFs). In viral GenBank, CDS sequences are specified with actual ORF sequences among such ORF fragments. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons begun by a start codon (ATG) and terminated by a stop codon (usually UAA, UAG, or UGA). If transcription is terminated before the stop codon, an incorrect protein is produced. Caliciviridae have three ORFs—ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF1 sequence is involved in the translation of non-structural polyproteins while ORF2 and ORF3 sequences are engaged in generating the major and minor capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2, respectively (Fig. 2) [6]. VP1 protein consists of two domains: P is split to P1, P2 and S. The P2 subdomain is considered with the region involved in cellular interactions and immune recognition [2].
