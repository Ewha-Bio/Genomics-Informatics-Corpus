Distribution of ESNPs and ECNPs
We confirmed the high proportion of African (YRI)-specific SNPs from 3 races: Asian, Caucasian, and African (Supplementary Fig. 5). Then, to search ESNPs from Pan-Asian ethnic groups, we identified 9,306 ESNPs from the Pan-Asian SNP markers and examined the distribution of the ESNPs at the 3 population levels: super-, sub-, and ethnic population (Fig. 1A). We found that 67.82% of ESNPs in the superpopulation level were others, including IN-NI, IN-TB, and CN-UG. It could show that isolated ethnic groups keep their original features and that these features are also presented in other population levels. In the subpopulations, Austronesian, IN-NI, and IN-TB had 95.31% of ESNPs. Additionally, we identified 28,282 CNPs based on the SNP chip profiles and then selected 5,167 ECNPs. We then examined the ECNPs in the 3 population levels (Fig. 1B). In the superpopulations, 36.57% of the ECNPs occurred in Caucasoids. Of the subpopulation ECNPs, 56.26% had Mongoloid features and 36.95% occurred in Uyghurs. Across the ethnic groups, 26.35% of the ECNPs were from Caucasoids (IN-NL). Most ECNPs occurred in Caucasoid populations (IN-NL, IN-IL, IN-DR, IN-SP, IN-EL, IN-WI, IN-WL, and SG-ID) and in ethnic groups that have Mongoloid features (IN-NI, IN-TB, and CN-UG). The ethnic group having Mongoloid features had more ECNPs than other groups, which shows that Pan-Asian ECNPs could serve as the criteria for ethnic specificity in Pan-Asian populations.
