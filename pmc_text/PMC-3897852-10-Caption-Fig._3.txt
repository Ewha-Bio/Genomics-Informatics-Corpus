Lineage-dependent frequency of major mutant genes. (A) Heatmap of the 12 major mutant genes in overall samples. Twelve mutant genes are ranked in the top 3 in at least one cancer type based on the % frequency in the overall samples. (B) Heatmap of the 17 major mutant genes in non-metastatic samples, ranked in the top 3 in at least one cancer type based on the % frequency in metastatic and non-metastatic samples. Two genes colored in blue are derived from non-metastatic samples, and 7 genes colored in red are derived from metastatic samples. Others colored in black are commonly selected in metastatic and non-metastatic samples. (C) Heatmap of the 17 major mutant genes in metastatic samples. The list of genes is the same as in Fig. 3B. Red represents high % frequency and yellow represents low % frequency. In the heatmap for metastatic and non-metastatic samples, three cancer types-OV, GBM, and UCEC-were excluded, because the information on metastasis was not provided. THCA, thyroid carcinoma; OV, ovarian serous cy_stadenocarcinoma; LUAD, lung adenocarcinoma; LUSC, lung squamous cell carcinoma; HNSC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; BLCA, bladder urothelial carcinoma; COAD, colon adenocarcinoma; READ, rectum adenocarcinoma; GBM, glioblastoma multiforme; UCEC, uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma; KIRC, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.
