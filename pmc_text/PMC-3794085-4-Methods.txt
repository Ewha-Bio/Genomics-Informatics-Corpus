Study genotypes
The genotyping of the cohort population was previously described for the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) study [14]. Most DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of participants and genotyped using the Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The quality control steps of genotypes have been described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, the accuracy of the genotyping was determined by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) genotyping algorithm [15]. Consequently, 333,651 SNPs had a missing genotype call rate below 0.1, a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.01, and no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p > 1 Ã— 10-6). To examine the population stratification, multidimensional scaling analysis and principal component analysis were performed using 44,724 pruned SNP markers [14].
