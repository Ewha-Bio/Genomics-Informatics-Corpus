Biophysical properties and phylogenetic relationship of the 120 and 150 kDa proteins of the TsM CF. (A) The 120 kDa protein (fraction IV) was separated in a pH range of 6–11, after which it was further resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. The subunit proteins of 14, 16, 18, 22, and 28 kDa, which were identified by proteome analysis, are seen. (B) Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the subunits of the 120 kDa macromolecule were clustered into two groups of 14 and 18 kDa lineages. (C) 2DE analysis of the 150 kDa protein (fraction III). The protein was isoelectrically focused using IPGphor (pH 6–11), after which it was further separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Each protein was subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. (D) Phylogenetic analyses of the subunit proteins. The representative amino acid sequences were aligned, and optimized with ClustalW and GeneDoc. The phylogram was constructed with the neighborjoining algorithm (PHYLIP). The statistical significance of each branching node was evaluated with 1,000 random samples. TsM, Taenia solium metacestode; CF, cyst fluid; SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; 2DE, two-dimensional electrophoresis; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Mr, molecular weights in kDa.
