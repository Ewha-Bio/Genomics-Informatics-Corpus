Rare alleles are more enriched in the epigenetic signals located in the first introns than in other introns
We next investigated whether the proportions of rare alleles in the first introns were significantly different from those in other downstream introns. As expected, rare alleles in the first introns were significantly more enriched with all the epigenetic signals we tested than other downstream introns (Fig. 1B). It seems reasonable that the first introns carried significantly more rare alleles than the other downstream introns at the sites where epigenetic chromatin marks are located, considering that first introns tend to harbor a greater quantity of epigenetic signals [10,11]. A further notable finding is that the different Tier-1 cell lines showed significantly different amounts of rare alleles in H3K27ac, an active chromatin mark, and in H3K27me3, a polycomb repressive mark. It seems that embryonic stem cells (i.e., H1- hESC cells) tended to carry more rare alleles in active signals (H3K27ac) than in repressive signals (H3K27me3), whereas fully differentiated cells, such as GM12878 and K562 cells, showed higher proportions of rare alleles in repressive marks than in active marks (Fig. 1B). However, the observation of a significantly greater quantity of rare alleles in the first introns than in other introns still stands, despite these differences in the proportions of rare alleles in each chromatin mark site in different cell types.
