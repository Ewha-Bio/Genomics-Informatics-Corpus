Reverse-transcription (RT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification
To eliminate possible DNA contamination of purchased RNA samples, Turbo DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A no-RT control was also amplified to double-check the absence of DNA contamination. Quantity of RNA samples was measured using a ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). Moloney-Murine-Leukemia-Virus reverse transcriptase with an annealing temperature of 42℃ was used for the RT reaction with RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To develop the specific primers for individual alternative transcripts, primer pairs were designed with the aid of Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/) (Table 1). In each run, 1 µL of cDNA was used as template for amplification per reaction. RT-PCR was performed using reactions containing a mixed cDNA template, representing a combination of different tissues examined. RT-PCR amplification for functional genes and a housekeeping gene was carried out for 30 cycles of 94℃ for 3 minutes, 56-60℃ for 1 minute, and 72℃ for 3 minutes. As a standard control, G3PDH was amplified through RT-PCR in human tissues. PCR products were loaded on 1-2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.
