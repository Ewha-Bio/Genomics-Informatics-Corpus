DNA sample preparation (normal and tumor samples)
Genomic DNA samples were prepared for WES. They were freshly obtained from AML patients' bone marrow at initial diagnosis. Subsequent bone marrow samples were aspirated if necessary according the disease status of the patients. AML blast tumor cells were isolated from bone marrow of each patient using Ficoll gradient separation. Matching patients' saliva samples were collected as germline controls. Each tumor and control DNA was extracted via standard protocols of DNA purification. DNA samples for validation were obtained from our frozen stock as needed.
