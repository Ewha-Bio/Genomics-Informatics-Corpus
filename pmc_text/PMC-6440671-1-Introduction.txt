In the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified genetic variants associated with human traits and complex diseases. However, traditional GWASs have several issues and limitations that do not completely explain the heritability of complex human diseases or related traits—so-called missing heritability [1]. To address these issues, various approaches have been proposed, such as rare variant association analysis, genetic interactions, and epistasis [1]. Among possible explanations for missing heritability, there has been growing consideration of gene-gene interaction (GGI) analysis for common genetic variants in terms of statistical approaches and analysis software. Although most research models focus on the case-control study design, there are not many software programs that can analyze a continuous phenotype. Furthermore, GGI analysis has several advantages in terms of statistical power, computing performance, and biological interpretation over single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)‒SNP interaction (SSI) analysis, but there is not much analysis software to analyze it.In this study, we developed software for “Hierarchical Structural Component Analysis of Gene-Gene Interactions” (HisCoM-GGI) [2] that can analyze both GGI and SSI analyses for a continuous phenotype. The basic framework of the HisCoM-GGI software was “Workbench for Integrated Superfast Association study with Related Data” (WISARD) [3], which accepts various types of input formats and provides quality control or data management options that can be used to filter out individuals or genetic variants. In addition, the WISARD program supports multithreading to improve the efficiency of the analysis. By using the advantages of WISARD, HisCoM-GGI software includes all of the functions for GGI analysis on a genomewide scale, such as input format support, data preprocessing, and multithreading.
