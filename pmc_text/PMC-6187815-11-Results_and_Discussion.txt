Pharmacokinetic and toxicity analysis
The ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin compounds were further studied for their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity using the pkCSM and FAF-Drug approaches. First, the Ames toxicity analysis of the compounds was performed, and it was seen that ofloxacin and norfloxacin do not show Ames toxicity. Since Ames test positive compounds may be mutagenic and may lead to cancer. Moreover, all four compounds were not found to inhibit the hERG-1 (human ether a go-go gene) and hERG-2. The inhibition of these regulatory potassium channels leads to the development of long QT syndrome to fatal ventricular arrhythmia.
Based on the hydrophobicity of the designed compounds, the oral bioavailability was also calculated using the FAF-Drugs and pkCSM software. The FAF-Drugs prediction showed that all four compounds have a good oral bioavailability based on Veber’s and Egan’s rules. Next, using the pkCSM software, the maximum recommended tolerated doses were calculated for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin. All four compounds were found to have high oral rat acute toxicity values (2.311, 2.22, 2.237, and 2.216 log mg/kg/day, respectively). This indicates the high tolerance of compounds with recommended tolerated doses (Table 6). The results were based on the maximum recommended starting dose in the phase-1 clinical trials, based on the experimental data of 1,222 human clinical trials. Importantly, these compounds were also not found to cause any skin sensations. Lastly, we analyzed the antibacterial characteristics of the compounds against Tetrahymena pyriformis. We found that all the analyzed compounds (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin) have a high toxicity against the protozoa with a high IGC50 (concentration required to inhibit the 50% growth in log μg/L) score: 0.344, 0.292, 0.286, and 0.29 μg/L respectively. Moreover, the Minnow toxicity values for the compounds were calculated and showed that ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin have values of 1.64, 1.3, 1.47, and 1.21, respectively. These results concluded that ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin have good bioactivity with significant pharmacological properties.
In conclusion, among the four tested FQs (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin), ofloxacin exhibited a high antibacterial activity by in silico assays with high binding docking score of −38.52 kJ/mol to topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase (a well-known antibacterial target protein). All four analyzed FQ compounds meet Lipinski’s rule of five and show drug-likeliness. Based on our results, they also have a high passive absorption and good oral bioavailability based on Veber’s and Egan’s rules and is not toxic to humans.
The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic analysis of the compounds showed that all four compounds have good pharmacological properties. Moreover, ofloxacin was found to possess high IGC50 value of 0.286 μg/L against the T. pyriformis protozoa. Ofloxacin and norfloxacin compounds were tested to be negative for the Ames toxicity test, showing the non-carcinogenic character of the compounds. In particular, all four compounds exhibit marked activity against microorganisms, because they strongly interact with the active sites of topoisomerase II DNA gyrase enzymes and are supported by the optimal pharmacological properties.
