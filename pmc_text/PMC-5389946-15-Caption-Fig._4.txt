Chromatin state enrichment at the differentially methylated regions. (A) The proportions of chromatin states for the differentially methylated CpG sites compared to all CpG sites. The value was calculated as the ratio of the number of CpGs on the chromatin states among the total differentially methylated CpGs divided by the ratio of chromatin states among all CpGs. p-values from Fisher's exact tests are shown at the upper side on each bar. (B) Proportions of obese-hypermethlylated and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites are shown across 15 chromHMM-annotated chromatin states.
