Protein structure prediction and validation
MODELLER9v10 [5] and the SWISS-MODEL [6] server were used for protein structure prediction. The stereochemistry of each protein was evaluated through PROCHECK [7] analysis, available at the RCSB validation server (http://deposit.rcsb.org/validate/), and validated using ProSA-web [8] (http://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php).
