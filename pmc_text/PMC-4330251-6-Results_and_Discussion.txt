Gene ontology and pathway analysis
Gene ontology analysis using DAVID revealed that the 31 genes were enriched in the Wnt receptor signaling pathway (Fisher exact = 9.6E-5); 4 genes-RSPO2, RSPO3, SFRP1, and SFRP2-belonged to this pathway (Table 2). Site of Frizzled proteins (SFRP) genes interact directly with Wnt, the ligand of the Wnt signaling pathway Frizzled (Fz) receptor, inhibiting the binding of Wnt to Fz receptor [10].
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway diagram (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) also confirmed that Wnt and SFRP regulate the Wnt signaling pathway at the upstream level (Fig. 3).
