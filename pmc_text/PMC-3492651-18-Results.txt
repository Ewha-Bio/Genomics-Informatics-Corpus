KDO and IFN-β suppressed the effects of 8-Br in triple-ligand studies
Supplementary Table 6 shows the transcriptional responses in RAW 264.7 cells upon triple-ligand stimulation. We observed the following effects: 1) upregulation of the primary and secondary KDO- and IFN-β-responsive genes; 2) production of various inflammatory cytokines and their receptors (Il-1a, Il-1b, Il-6, Il-20, Il-17rb, Il-15, Il-18, Il-13, Il-4ra, Il-10ra, and Tnf) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10; 3) induction of apoptosis-inducing transcription factors (Fosl-1, Atf3, Egr1, Egr2, Fos-b, Jun dimerization protein [Jdp], and Irf14); and 4) up-regulation of multiple G-protein-coupled receptors, like leukotriene B4 receptor1 (Ltb4r1), complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5ar1), chemokine (c-c) receptor 1 (Ccr1), Gpr132, Gpr65, and calcitonin receptor-like (Calcr1). In these triple-ligand studies, the transcription factors exerting the greatest regulatory control over gene expression were NF-κB, Ap1, Nfat, Stat2, and Stat3. Our data demonstrated that concomitant stimulation with all three ligands induced KDO and IFN-β primary and secondary responsive genes, but it repressed 8-Br-induced transcriptional changes.
