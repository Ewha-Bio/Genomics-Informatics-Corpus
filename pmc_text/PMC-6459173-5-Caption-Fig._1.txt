Workflow of HisCoM-mimi. The hierarchical structural component analysis workflow for the HisCoM-mimi application is shown. HisCoM-mimi first constructs an mRNA-miRNA network that connects negatively correlated miRNAs and target mRNAs. It then estimates the model parameters by maximizing the objective function via the alternating least square method with double-penalty functions for the coefficients.
