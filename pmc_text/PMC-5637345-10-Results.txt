Expression analyses of miR-21-3p and PPIL2 genes in olive flounder tissues
To evaluate the relevance of the expression levels of miR-21-3p and PPIL2, the expression patterns were examined in various olive flounder tissues including spleen, gill, muscle, kidney, intestine, stomach, liver, fin, brain, and testis. The expression pattern of miR-21-3p in multiple tissues was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with miRNA U6 as a reference. The results displayed that miR-21-3p was up-regulated in most of tissues, except for testis. The expression level of miR-21-3p was highest in liver, followed by muscle. Testis expression level was relatively lower than other tissues except liver and muscle tissues (Fig. 8A).
The expression degree for PPIL2 in the numerous tissues were compared with the GAPDH as reference gene. Overall, most of the tissues were down-regulated compared with expression of miR-21-3p. Especially, testis showed the highest expression level of PPIL2 but PPIL2 was hardly expressed in the muscle, intestine, stomach, and liver (Fig. 8B). To sum up, the expression levels of miR-21-3p and PPIL2 mRNA were conversely related to most of tissues.
