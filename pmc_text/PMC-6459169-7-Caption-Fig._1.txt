Major BLAST hits matching the chinstrap and gentoo blood transcripts at the phylum and species levels. Each number indicates the quantity of orthologous gene families shared by the indicated genomic database (A). Four-way Venn diagram of orthologous gene conservation in four species of penguins: Adélie (Pygoscelis adeliae), chinstrap (P. antarcticus), emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri), and gentoo (P. papua) (B). The diagram was constructed with orthologous genes identified by the best reciprocal hit method with tBLASTx (E-value < 10–10) pair-wise ortholog matches. Numbers represent unique or shared genes between penguin species.
