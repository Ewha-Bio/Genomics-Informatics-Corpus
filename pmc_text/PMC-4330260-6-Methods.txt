Statistical analysis
Glucose and insulin levels were natural log-transformed. To examine the effects of SNP-BMI interactions on them, we conducted 4 statistical tests for each SNP. In all analyses, residential area, age, sex, and BMI were the covariates. The first 2 tests were linear regression analyses of lean (BMI < 25) and overweight subjects (BMI â‰¥ 25). The overall interactions between SNPs and BMI were analyzed using continuous BMI values and dichotomized BMI (lean subjects were coded with 1, and overweight subjects were coded with 2). Continuous BMI-SNP interaction analyses were performed using QUICKTEST (http://toby.freeshell.org/software/quicktest.shtml), and the dichotomized BMI-SNP interactions were analyzed using PLINK, version 1.07 [11].
