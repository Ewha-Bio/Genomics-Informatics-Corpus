PCR detection of different microbial groups in drinking water samples
DNA was extracted from the Prebiocide and Tank A water samples by using the Qiagen Miniprep Kit. Several microbial groups were analyzed by PCR amplification of gene fragments of several phylogenetic groups representing different microbial communities [23]. These groups included general bacteria, Bacillus species, gram-positive bacteria (high G + C content), Streptomyces species, eukaryotes (fungi, protists, and green algae), and general fungi. The PCR primer pairs used in the analysis and the groups they represent are listed in Table 1.
