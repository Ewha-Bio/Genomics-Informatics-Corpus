Occurrence of sequence variation by position within tags. The results show a summary of the 1,284 nucleotide sequence mutations in 7,734 Sanger-sequenced up-tags (dark grey) and down-tags (light grey) at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position in the 20-mer barcode is similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1%, except at position 1, which is the highest (3.1%). It shows a tendency to increase from position 20 to position 1. For the statistics in detail, refer to Table 4.
