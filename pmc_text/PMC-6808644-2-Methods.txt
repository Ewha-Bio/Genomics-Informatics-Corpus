FusionScan algorithm
The goal of FusionScan is to identify fusion transcripts composed of combination of intact exons with high sensitivity and specificity. Thus, FusionScan requires multiple split reads that join intact exons of two different genes. This may miss cases where the fusion boundary exists inside the exon but the limitation is minor since most of important fusion markers are combination of intact exons thus far. This can be ascribed to the fact that the introns are much longer than exons in most eukaryotic genomes (e.g., ~27 times longer in the human genome). Furthermore, with the advances in sequencing throughput, the read length and sequencing depth of RNA-Seq has become long and deep enough to have multiple split reads including fusion boundaries in most cases.
The algorithm consists of three main parts of preprocessing and mapping, fusion detection, and filtering steps as shown in Fig. 1. Usage of transcriptome model should be consistent through whole steps. We prefer the RefGene transcriptome model to the Ensembl because of its conservative criteria in modeling splice variants (e.g., total number of human transcripts for hg19 [GRCh37] assembly are 53,598 and 204,940 in the RefGene and Ensembl tracks of University of California Santa Cruz [UCSC] genome browser, respectively). Each step is optimized for reliable detection of fusion genes with high sensitivity and specificity as described below. To avoid confusion from naming, we will call two genes involved in the fusion as the head and tail genes according to the transcription direction of 5′→3′, and two exons adjacent to the fusion boundary as fusion exons.
