Calculation of molecular vibration
Since the EVA and CIMVF descriptors require geometry optimization of a given molecule, each provided theoretical 3-D conformer SDF underwent single low-energy conformation using the GAMESS program package [24]. Restricted Hartree-Fock calculations using the BLYP DFT method with the 6-31G basis set were performed to optimize the geometries of the molecules. Each result was taken as the representative conformation of the molecule, although the calculation of molecular vibrational frequency has some dependence on conformation. The results of geometry optimization were subjected to the calculation step for the molecular vibrational frequency with RUNTYP of HESSIAN in the GAMESS program.
