Virulence factors
As discussed in the last section, we have performed virulence factors analysis for all the 340 HPs to bring about virulent proteins that play an effective role in the propagation of disease. We preferable selected consensus-based approach for the purpose of taking the results of both predictors VICMpred and VirulentPred as positive. Thus, we found 22 HPs predicted virulent by both these programs (Table 2). While looking for the virulent proteins in the array of 104 predicted HPs, we found 11 HPs showing positive virulence that are mentioned in Table 1. Concrete specification of virulence proteins amongst the predicted functional candidates paves the way for further studies on drug discovery and development in a more focused way. Therefore, results of virulence factors analysis hold significant in the lookups for further study and experimental characterization of predicted HPs.
