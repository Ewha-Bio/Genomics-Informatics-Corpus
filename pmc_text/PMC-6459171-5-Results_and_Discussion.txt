Global gene expression in mouse lung type II cells was examined using oligonucleotide microarrays in order to gain insights into the expression levels of transcription factors and signal transduction pathways critical for the transcriptome. Transcript analysis revealed that approximately 2,000 genes (16.6%) were expressed in type II cells, out of the 12,000 genes represented on the U74A mouse Affymetrix chip. About 575 genes were highly expressed whereas about 1,425 were expressed at low levels. Furthermore, a master list of about 350 known and highly expressed genes was constructed (Supplementary Table 1). This list includes about 50 transcription factors that were highly expressed in mouse lung type II transcriptome. Transcriptional factors bind to upstream regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers and in co-operation with co-regulators and general transcriptional factors regulate gene expression [31]. The transcription factor profile of type II cells includes several members of the activator protein (AP1), ATF, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB), Kruppel-like zinc-finger proteins (KLF), and CAAT/enhancer binding proteins (c/EBP) families. A general feature of the transcriptome is the differential expression of multiple members of a transcription factor family that controls redundant, overlapping or non-redundant functions (Fig. 1A and 1B). These include AP1 (Fos, Fosb, jun, Junb, and Jund), ATF (Atf3 and Atf4), NF-kB (Nfkb1 and Rela), and nuclear receptor or NR (Nr4a1 and Nr5a1) 5 family members. Many of these transcription factors have a prominent role in immune responses. Protein domain analysis revealed that the transcription factors have specific domains (leucine zipper, helix-loop-helix, zinc finger, Rel or Kruppel) that facilitate extensive homo-dimerization (ex., c-Jun) or hetero-dimerization (ex., Fos-Jun) that further expands the repertoire of gene regulation. Members of cellular enhancer binding protein or C/EBP family are involved in the regulation of multiple cell types [26]. Metallothioneins (Mt) are regulated by heavy metals and inflammatory response [32]. Nrf2 is a transcription factor with a basic-leucine zipper domain and regulates a large number antioxidant and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme genes through the antioxidant response element (ARE) [27]. Nuclear Receptor family members (Nr4a1 and Nr5a1) are highly expressed in lung epithelium [33]. KLF family members such as Klf4, Klf5 and Klf9 are implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis [34]. Mammalian Btg/Tob family regulates transcription in the nucleus and messenger RNA deadenylation and implicated in anti-proliferation in multiple cell types [35]. Expression levels of transcription factors could vary significantly from high such as Y-box1 (Ybx1) and high mobility group (Hmgn1); moderate such as catennin β (Ctnnb) and metallothionein1 (Mt1) or low like Stat3 and sterol regulatory element binding protein (Srebf1) in type II cells (Fig. 1C). Cluster analysis of transcription factors with biological terms in DAVID Bioinformatics revealed that hetero-dimerization leucine zipper domain as a key regulatory property present in AP1, ATF, and NR families. Furthermore, protein phosphorylation, metal binding and dimerization are major regulatory mechanisms of this category (data not shown). Functional properties of type II cells such as detoxification (response to organic cyclic compounds), cytokine signaling (tumor necrosis factor or TNF-α) and cell growth (development and cancer) were also well represented based on p-value (Fig. 2A). Mapping the list of transcription factors on to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed that TNF-α is the major signal transduction pathway functional in lung type II cells (Fig. 2B). TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) is ubiquitous and is expressed on lung epithelial cells [9]. TNF signaling is mediated through TNFR1 to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinases including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular receptor kinases (ERK), p38 and IκB kinases to activate NF-kB [36,37]. In addition to NF-kB, TNF-α also activates AP1 via JNK and ATF via JNK, ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways [36-38]. Involvement of ERK, JNK, p38 MAP kinases and transcription factors AP1, NF-kB, and ATF has been described in response to influenza infection [39]. TNF-α plays an important role in CD8+ T-cell mediated lung injury [21]. In a mouse transgenic model, lung injury was largely mediated by chemokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon CD8+ T-cell recognition and this response was dependent on TNFR1 [9]. Protein-protein interactions play an important role in co-operative and functional diversity of transcriptional networks in biological functions of multiple cell types [31]. Network analysis of transcription factor interactions in protein interaction databases revealed that extensive interactions between AP1, ATF, NF-kB, NR, and C/EBP family members are possible (Fig. 3). Furthermore, these interactions also predict a potential role for Atf3, Nr4a1, and AP1 family members in TNF-α induced CD8+ T-cell mediated lung injury.In gene expression analysis, clustering algorithm is often used to discriminate genes that are co-regulated in the experimental conditions studied [30]. Furthermore, cluster analysis in multiple tissues facilitates detection of overlapping and tissue-specific patterns of gene expression. This analysis revealed that the gene expression profile of lung and type II were closely related among all tissues tested (Supplementary Fig. 1). Consistent with these observations, shared transcription factor co-expression profiles include Xbp1, Stat3, and Srebf1. Furthermore, transcripts of Mt1, Atf3, Ybx1, and Hmgn1 levels were highly expressed in lung type II compared to the lung (Fig. 4). Cluster analysis also showed examples of highly expressed genes in type II cells compared to lung included SP-C, mucin1 (Muc1), lysozyme2 (Lyz2), ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCA3), sodium-phosphate co-transporter, hemolytic component, heat shock protein (84 kDa), catenin-src, Gro1, and Rab9 (Figs. 4 and 5, Supplementary Fig. 1). There is an overlapping gene expression profile signature between liver and type II cells (data not shown). Liver and lung type II have also a common role in lipid metabolism and express high level of transcription factors Cebpa and Srebf1 that are implicated in lipid metabolism [26,40].Expression levels of cell surface adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin (Cdh) and EpCAM are useful for staining and sorting lung epithelial cells [22]. A highly conserved cellular process in development known as epithelial-to-mesenchyme transition is responsible for transforming epithelial cells in metastatic lung cancer and tumor [41]. Sex determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9) was originally known for its functions in embryonic development specifically in bone formation, testis and lung development [42]. Sox9 is important for stem cell maintenance, tumor progression and metastasis [43]. Pluripotent Sox9 positive lung stem cells are capable of generating airway and type II cells in mice and transplantation of the Sox9+ human lung stem cells in cancer patients have been described [22,25]. I have investigated the transcription factors signature characteristic of lung type II cells in Sox9 positive stem cells of E12.5 lung mouse development and adult lung stem cells from mice [22]. Cluster analysis showed that the gene signature consisting of Stat3, Srebf1, Elf3, Klf5, Cebpa was highly expressed in adult mouse lung stem cells sorted for epithelial markers Cdh or EpCAM (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these results, lung type II marker genes such as surfactant protein C (sftpc), Mucin (Muc1), lysozyme 2 (Lyz2) were also highly expressed in adult compared with E12.5 Sox9+ stem cells. Under defined chemical conditions, E12.5 Sox9 positive lung stem cells can be differentiated into type II cells in vitro, after 2–10 passages in cell culture [22]. Interestingly, the same five transcription factors were also highly expressed under these conditions (Fig. 5B). A major disadvantage of many transcriptome data studies is that they provide a snapshot of gene expression profile in cells or tissues. However, it is well known that gene expression is dynamically and temporally regulated during mouse development. For example, gene expression profile of proteins encoding extra-cellular matrix varies significantly during lung development [16]. Klf5 is expressed at higher levels in lung epithelial cells at the E18.5 stage of mouse development and mice lacking Klf5 die at the time of birth due to respiratory distress [34,44]. Data mining of the transcription factor signature of Stat3, Srebf1, Elf3, Klf5, and Cebpa within the gene expression data set of mouse lung developmental stages revealed that the expression was relatively low in early developmental stages such as E9.5–E12.5, moderate in E14.5–E15.5 and relatively high during late embryonic developmental stages of E16.5–E18.5 (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the gene expression levels are dynamic over time in 8 different stages of mouse lung development. Transcription factor profile is intimately linked with the gene expression profile of any given cell type. Unique combination of transcription factors assembled on individual gene promoter determines the level of gene activity [23,31]. Furthermore, functional organization of mouse lung type II transcriptome can be elucidated in terms of potential role of specific combination of transcription factors. Multiple transcription factors have been shown to play an important role in the lung type II specific cell functions such as detoxification, lipid metabolism, immune responses and cell growth as revealed by knockout mouse models, as discussed below (Fig. 7).
