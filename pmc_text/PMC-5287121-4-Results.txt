Below, we show the characteristics of the two methods and the connections between the two methods. We first show that each method is optimized to meet a unique optimality criterion. Then, we show that the two methods are connected, by using both analytical derivations and empirical simulations. Finally, we demonstrate a situation in which the two methods can give different results using real data.
