Validated genotypes of a 20q13.12 copy number variation (CNV) region in this study. Genotypes of a CNV region on chromosome 20q13.12. The copy number state of cases (left) and control samples (right). The higher bar, lower bar, and no bar in each figure represent a normal number of copies, heterozygous deletion, and homozygous deletion, respectively. The blue bar means the copy number state of the NA10851 sample, which was used as the reference sample.
