Statistical tests
All statistical tests and box plot representations were conducted using R (version 3.5.2) [16] with R studio (version 1.1.463) [17]. The Wilcoxon test was performed using the stat_compare_means function of the ggpubr R package (https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/ggpubr/index.html) to investigate the statistical significance of 6 differences among groups. In-house Python scripts were used for the remaining mapping and parsing analyses (version 3.7.2, http://www.python.org).
