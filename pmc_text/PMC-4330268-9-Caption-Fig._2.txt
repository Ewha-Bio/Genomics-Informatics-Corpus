Examples of MAP software output. MAP software generates the summary metrics and graphical illustration of user-selected mutations. (A) Example of summary metrics. Summary metrics include mutation status for each sample, total mutation frequency, p-values for differences between phenotype groups based on clinical information, genomic position, reference/observed sequence, and additional information, such as read depth by default. (B, C) Examples of frequency (B)- and p-value (C)-based visualization, respectively. The left and right of the heat-map represent the sample name and mutational spectrum, respectively. The bottom of the heat-map represents the gene name by color for the mutational spectrum. Frequency or p-value plots are represented on top of the heat-map. MAP, mutation arranger for defining phenotype-related single-nucleotide variant.
