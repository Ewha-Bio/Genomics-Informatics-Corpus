Prediction of Metal Ion Binding Sites in Proteins from Amino Acid Sequences by Using Simplified Amino Acid Alphabets and Random Forest Model
Metal binding proteins or metallo-proteins are important for the stability of the protein and also serve as co-factors in various functions like controlling metabolism, regulating signal transport, and metal homeostasis. In structural genomics, prediction of metal binding proteins help in the selection of suitable growth medium for overexpressionâ€™s studies and also help in obtaining the functional protein. Computational prediction using machine learning approach has been widely used in various fields of bioinformatics based on the fact all the information contains in amino acid sequence. In this study, random forest machine learning prediction systems were deployed with simplified amino acid for prediction of individual major metal ion binding sites like copper, calcium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc.
