Secondary structure determination
Three categories of "helix," "extended," and "others" were used for the classification of the secondary structures of each residue. Secondary structure determination for each residue referred to the backbone torsion angle values. Amino acid residue was classified into "helix" if the backbone torsion angles belonged to the range of (φ, ψ) = (-155° to -47°, -62° to -52°), (-104° to -47°, -52° to -37°), and (-117° to -104°, -52° to -37°). A residue was classified into the "extended" secondary structure if the backbone torsion angles belonged to the range of (φ, ψ) = (-155° to -138°, 90° to 155°), (-140° to -64°, 90° to 180°), (-64° to -53°, 90° to 100°, or 110° to 168°). Residues with backbone torsion angles belonging to other ranges were classified as "others." The range was determined based on typical Ramachandran plots.
