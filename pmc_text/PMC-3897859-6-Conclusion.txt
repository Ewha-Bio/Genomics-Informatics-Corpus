hpvPDB brings together comprehensive information on a total of 1,036 protein sequences and 743 predicted structures. The outcome of this study might provide a platform for simultaneous structural comparative analysis of these proteins and help in finding out variations in their structures to explore why different strains of HPV have causative associations with different types of cancers. Further, this might also help in designing specific drugs or vaccines against specific strains of HPV. This reserve provides a resource to help virologists identify potential roles for viral protein. Currently the hpvPDB is updated manually through online resources and available scientific publication review; however, to sustain the quality, these data are analyzed and checked before incorporation into this reserve. Meanwhile, to provide regular updates, our team is committed to searching for newly sequenced HPV strains, updating this reserve, and serving the users.
