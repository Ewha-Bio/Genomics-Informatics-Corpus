TM4SF5-mediated EMT in tumor progression
TM4SF5 expression in hepatocytes or NSCLC leads to EMT phenotypes, which in turn cause loss of contact inhibition [74], enhance migration and invasion for metastasis [77], and render gefitinib resistance [78]. TM4SF5 expression causes morphological changes through abnormal regulation of RhoA and Rac1 in hepatocytes, together with the loss of E-cadherin expression leading to EMT induction [74] via induction of Slug [79]. Inhibition of TM4SF5-mediated signaling events of the cytosolic enrichment of p27Kip1 abolishes abnormal multilayer cell growth [74] and retards the G1 to S phase progression [80]. Further, inhibition of TM4SF5-mediated EMT by suppression of cytosolic p27Kip1 expression leads gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells to become gefitinib-sensitive [78]. TM4SF5 is involved in activation of hepatic stellate cells by causing EMT processes, leading to a correlation with the development of liver fibrosis in CCl4-treated mouse models [81]. TM4SF5 expression is achieved by TGFβ1-mediated Smad actions on EGFR activation [73], such that the important roles of the multifunctional cytokine TGFβ1 in the activation of hepatic stellate cells and the EMT are confirmed in a development of murine liver fibrosis. Since liver fibrosis can eventually lead to hepatocarcinoma at a high rate of over 70% [82], the roles of TM4SF5 in the development of both fibrosis and tumorigenesis in the liver can be reasonable.
Meanwhile, TM4SF5 expression enhances directional migration and invasion of hepatocytes. TM4SF5 in hepatocytes causes directional migration at an enhanced speed and the formation of more invadosome-like structures enriched with cortactin, actin, and actin-regulatory proteins, like Arp2 and WASP [77]. TM4SF5-mediated directional migration involves direct interaction and activation of FAK via the ICL domain of TM4SF5 and the F1 lobe of the FAK FERM domain [75]. Further, TM4SF5-mediated invasive ECM degradation requires direct interaction between the COOH-terminus of TM4SF5 and c-Src, which is linked to Tyr845 phosphorylation of EGFR to form more invasive protrusions [76]. TM4SF5-mediated multilayer growth [74], FAK activity, migration, and invasion [75] are abolished by an anti-TM4SF5 reagent, TSAHC (a synthetic compound), which appears to affect its N-glycosylation and at the same time block induction of the TM4SF5-dependent EMT phenotype and multilayer growth [83]. Therefore, TM4SF5 also plays important roles in tumor initiation and progression, possibly being supported by an EMT process.
