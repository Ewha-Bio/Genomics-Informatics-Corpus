Identification of putative unigenes involved in silymarin biosynthesis
Silybin A and B, iso-silybins A and B, silychristin A, isosilychristin, and silydianin are all collectively called silymarins. Silymarins are the major flavolignans produced in C. japonicum. Taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol are the two major precursors responsible for the production of silymarin [20] and are produced by the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathways, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5 (the highlighted boxes represent the enzymes annotated in our data). The unigenes identified for the silymarin production in C. japonicum are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Most enzymes responsible for the production of silymarin were found in all three tissues (flower, leaf, and root) of C. japonicum. Subsequently, silymarin formation occurs via the oxidative radicalization of taxifolin and coniferyl alcohol, followed by a combinational radical coupling [21]. Genes corresponding to the silymarin biosynthetic pathway (flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes) were selected from the C. japonicum transcripts, and the expression patterns were compared among the flower, leaf and root tissues (Supplementary Table 2). The organ-specific gene expression patterns in C. japonicum were confirmed by the heat map technique (Fig. 6). The maximum number of genes was found to be downregulated in leaf tissues.
