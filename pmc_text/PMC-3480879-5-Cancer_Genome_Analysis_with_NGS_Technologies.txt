Returning to biology for clinical utility
As discussed above, there are many factors contributing to tumor heterogeneity, which may impede the discovery of new biomarkers. Thus, we are now urgently in need of developing new strategies for biomarker discovery from cancer genome data. Considering the huge complexity of the cancer genome and the limitation of current technologies, it would be a reliable strategy to evaluate the functional relevance of the candidate biomarkers rather than simply showing the statistical significance of the association by enrolling larger samples or applying more stringent statistics. Although the conventional strategies for biomarker discovery do not require the functional significance of the candidates [43], current hurdles in cancer genomics request a functional validation step in the pipeline of the biomarker discovery. Our limited understanding of the complexity of cancer biology is a significant challenge for translational interpretation of the cancer genome.
