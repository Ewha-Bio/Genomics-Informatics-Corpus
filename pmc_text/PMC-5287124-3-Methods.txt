Experimental evaluation
The experiments have been conducted using the 1000 Genomes phase1 release 3 (1000G) data of East Asian populations (286 individuals from Japanese [JPT], Han Chinese from Beijing [CHB], and Han Chinese form South China [CHS]) [15] and HapMap phase III (HapMap) dataset of 170 individuals from JPT and CHB populations [16].
We used phased genotype data of 75,582 SNPs with minor allele frequency of 0.05 and without indel polymorphisms in chromosome 22 (chr22: 16,050,612–51,243,297) in 1000G dataset, and the phased genotype data of 13,994 SNPs in chromosome 22 (chr22: 16,180,203–51,219,006) in HapMap dataset after applying the same pruning criteria as the case of 1000G.
To construct experimental subsets of 1000G dataset with different density settings, we randomly selected 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% of SNPs (resulting in 60,446, 45,349, 30,233, and 15,116 SNPs, respectively) of all SNP markers in the 1000G dataset in successive order by limiting the selection of SNPs within the SNPs already selected by the bigger subsets.
We applied the three Haploview methods (CI, FGT, and SS), PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++ to the entire 1000G dataset of chromosome 22, the entire HapMap dataset of chromosome 22, and the four datasets constructed from the 1000G dataset with the subsets of SNP markers chosen by the above method (80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% sampling ratio). To obtain results of CI, FGT, and SS, we constructed the moving windows of 1,000 SNPs for every 500 SNPs and run the Haploview program for each window region. When some block boundaries do not agree in the results of overlapped regions in consecutive windows, which occurs usually for the blocks at the boundary of a window, we construct a combined block region of two different block identification results and take it as the final haplotype block.
For PLINK-MIG++ and S-MIG++, there was no need to split the markers of the data used in our experiments due to enough capacity for runtime/memory of two programs. Note that in Haploview program, the CI method declares the size-2 blocks and size-3 blocks as haplotype blocks only when they do not span more than 20 kb and 30 kb, respectively. When we obtained the results using PLINKMIG++ and S-MIG++, we did not apply these limits for size-2 and size-3 blocks as the program does not allow this option. For the CI method, we set the option of Haploview to only consider the SNP pairs that are apart less than 500 kb such that the haplotype block size would be less than the limit. We applied the same condition about the distance between two SNPs in a pair to PLINK-MIG++, but not to S-MIG++ as the program does not allow this option. When we applied S-MIG++ program [13] to the experiments, we set the sampling fraction option of the first step of the algorithm to be 0.01.
