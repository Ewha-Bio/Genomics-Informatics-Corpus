miR-27a expression level in paired tissue samples
We examined the miR-27a expression level in 73 paired gastric cancer tissues to confirm the oncogenic expression of this miRNA variant. The miR-27a expression level was elevated 2.8-fold in gastric cancer tissues compared with non-tumor tissues (p = 1.96e-06) (Fig. 2A), and this miRNA was highly expressed in 61 out of 73 gastric cancer patient samples (80%). The miR-27a expression levels were highly elevated in all stages compared with non-tumor tissues (Fig. 2B). We divided the patient samples into diffuse and intestinal types, based on the Lauren classification, because gastric cancer patients with diffuse-type tumors have a much poorer prognosis than those with the intestinal type. We observed that the miR-27a expression levels were not significantly different between intestinal and diffuse types (p = 0.19; data not shown). By ROC analysis, we observed that the optimal cut-off value for discriminating between patients and healthy individuals was 0.0067 for a miR-27a expression. miR-27a had 73% sensitivity and 62% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer (Fig. 2C). Importantly, we observed a significant association between miR-27a overexpression and poor survival (p = 0.03) (Fig. 2D), suggesting that miR-27a has potential to be used as a prognostic marker for patients with gastric cancer. Taken together, the miR-27a expression pattern resembled that of an oncogenic microRNA and was associated with gastric cancer patient survival.
