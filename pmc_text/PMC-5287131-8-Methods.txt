Molecular docking
Molecular docking between the predicted model of potential drug target with each of the nine natural compounds was conducted using AutoDock-4.2 algorithm (http://autodock.scripps.edu/), by considering the protein structure as rigid whereas ligands were kept as flexible. AutoDock algorithm requires pre calculated grid maps, one for each atom type present in the flexible molecules being docked, and it stores the potential energy arising from the interaction with rigid macro molecules [41]. Ligands were docked around the identified conserved region within the functional domain of the selected drug target. The favorable poses were selected on the basis of lowest binding energy calculated by AutoDock which indicates for most favorable binding conformation between receptor and ligands. Docking procedure was carried out as per normal methodology for protein-ligand docking [4243]. The visualization and analysis of interaction between docked complexes were made using Discovery Studio 3.5 suites.
