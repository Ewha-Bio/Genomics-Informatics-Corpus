Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are defined as RNA transcripts that are not translated into proteins. Classically, only a limited number of RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, small nuclear RNAs, and small nucleolar RNAs, were perceived as ncRNAs. However, this view changed completely after in-depth analysis of mammalian transcriptomes (reviewed in Mattick and Makunin [1]). A decade ago, the advent of next generation sequencing and high-resolution genome tiling arrays revealed that up to 70% of the human genome is transcribed but only about 2% is occupied by protein-coding regions. Moreover, some ncRNAs were found to play regulatory roles for gene expression, as compared to classical ncRNAs that play housekeeping roles. So, ncRNAs are much more dominant in quantity and more diverse in function, than they were thought before.
These regulatory ncRNAs have been a topic of intense study during the last decade. So far, most regulatory ncRNAs bind to target genes via nucleic acid interaction to serve as a specificity factor to recruit effector proteins (Fig. 1). For example, nuclear ncRNAs recruit chromatin remodeling factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) recruit the mRNA-slicing complex (reviewed in Fatica and Bozzoni [2] and Filipowicz et al. [3]). Our laboratory has recently discovered a ncRNA that functions in a completely different way and we named it nc886 [45]. nc886's function is to bind to a protein and control its activity, rather than to recognize target DNA or RNA. Here, a summary of its characteristics and roles in cancer will be reviewed.
