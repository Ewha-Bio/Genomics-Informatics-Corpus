While neuropeptides are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including hunger, food intake, body weight regulation, and circadian rhythms, it has been shown that dysregulation of neuropeptides often results in a variety of neurological disorders [131415]. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Neuropeptides, such as arginine-vasopressin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), enkephalin, Î²-endorphin, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and tachykinins, were shown to have proconvulsive effects, whereas other neuropeptides, like ACTH, angiotensin, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone, were able to suppress seizures in the brain [16]. In addition, neuropeptides, such as dynorphin and substance P, were shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease with motor and non-motor symptoms [17]. Progression to addiction is also known to be influenced by several peptidergic neuromodulators. A few orexigenic neuropeptides, including galanin, enkephalin, and orexin/hypocretin, were shown to have a positive feedback relationship to alcohol, while other hypothalamic neuropeptides, such as dynorphin, CRF, and melanocortins, showed a negative feedback relationship to alcohol intake. Dysregulation of these multiple neuropeptides is assumed to result in alcohol addiction [18]. There was also a report that neuropeptides, such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide/PACAP, and neuropeptide Y (NPY), are associated with regulation of cutaneous immune responses and tissue maintenance and repair. Due to these diverse functions of neuropeptides, neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors have been drug targets for the treatment of neurological disorders [319].
