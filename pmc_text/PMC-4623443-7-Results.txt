miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155 expression levels in screening cohort
To select potential miRNAs for gastric cancer detection, we divided our samples into the 30 screening cohort and 40 validation cohort. The expression levels of three well-known oncogenic miRNAs were evaluated in 30 plasma samples consisting of 15 patients with gastric cancer and 15 healthy controls. Box plots for the quantitative fluorogenic real-time PCR values are shown in Fig. 1. The miR-21 and miR-155 expression levels were not significantly different between the neoplastic group and the control (p = 0.08 and p = 0.27) (Fig. 1A and 1C). However, the plasma miR-27a expression levels were significantly higher in the patients with gastric cancer (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1B). Although miR-21 expression level in plasma was tend to be increased in patient with gastric cancer compared to healthy control (p = 0.08), we selected miR-27a as a high priority for further analysis.
