The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) is a world-wide initiative, which over the course of five years has managed to bring groups of researchers all over the world together in converting their clinical patient data (electronic health records, claims, clinical registries) into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). This initiative has built a large set of publicly available tools which allow researchers to standardize the way they build patient cohorts, characterize their data [1], perform large scale patient level prediction studies [2], and perform electronic phenotyping [3]. In just a few years the OHDSI initiative has managed to perform large-scale studies involving over 200 million patients [4], answer drug safety questions by analyzing the association of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam with increased risk for angioedema in 10 international databases [5], and has characterized the effectiveness of second-line treatment of type 2 diabetes after initial therapy with metformin in over 246 million patients [6]. All of these massive studies have been made possible thanks to the use of a CDM and a standardized vocabulary. This strength becomes a weakness as the vocabulary standardizes multiple external vocabularies, ontologies and term sets, such as SNOMED, RxNorm, MeSH, and 90+ others, but it does not provide an easy way to link them to additional resources such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) [7] and other linked open data resources like Bio2rdf [8] and BioPortal [9]. During our time at the Biomedical Link Data Hackathon 5 in Kashiwa, Japan we developed the first attempt to create an RDF version of the OHDSI vocabulary with linkages to UMLS and BioPortal.
