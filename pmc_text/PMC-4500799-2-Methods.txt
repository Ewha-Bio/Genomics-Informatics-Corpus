Sequence retrieval
Six randomly selected HPs which contain standard number of amino acids sequences of V. cholerae O139 were randomly retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) for annotation. Moreover these were supposed to find out interactions between these proteins as they are both from chromosomal and plasmid DNA. The sequence IDs of those 6 HPs were gi|84095108, gi|163644906, gi|163644912, gi|163644916, gi|84468567, and gi|84468557. Various computational tools and databases were used to analyze the different properties i.e., physicochemical, functional, and structural characteristics of HPs.
