Schematic representation of methodology of performing an exhaustive search and stringent validations in identifying potential leads for combating toxoplasmosis. Multilevel precision: screens the National Cancer Institute (NCI) ligands based on Glide docking score. Molecular Docking: identifies the favorable interactions formed with the key residues. Pass: helps in discovering additional effects of the top compounds that might favor in suppressing the broad spectrum of toxoplasmosis effects. Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MMGBSA): calculates the free energy binding. Molecular dynamics: evaluates the backbone stability, fluctuation, and compactness of the complex. HTVS, high-throughput virtual screen; PASS, Prediction of Activity Spectra of Substances; RMSD, root mean square deviation; RMSF, root mean square fluctuation; SP, standard precision; XP, extra precision.
