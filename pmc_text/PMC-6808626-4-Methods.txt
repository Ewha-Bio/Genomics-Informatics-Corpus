Our web service is implemented using Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/), a Python library that facilitates the creating of web interfaces, and the aforementioned spaCy (https://spacy.io). spaCy’s structure is modular, and processing text happens by calling the respective modules. For our approach, we added a further processing step between “tokenization” and “dependency parsing,” during which we will recompute token segmentation taking into account named entities provided. Then we pass the adjusted token offsets to the dependency parsing module.
