Heat Map representation of differentially expressed genes between E12.5 development and adult lung Sox9+ progenitors in vivo. (A) Cadherin (Cdh) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) positive (+) and negative (â€“) adult epithelial cell populations were shown. (B) E12.5 Sox9+ progenitor cells after early (P2) or late (P10) cell passage in chemically defined medium in vitro. Lung type II gene markers such as Sftpc, Muc1, and Lyz2 were included for the purpose of comparison. Representative genes with differential expression are shown. Raw data values were normalized and are shown as rlog and a >2-fold change were represented by blue and red colors in either direction.
