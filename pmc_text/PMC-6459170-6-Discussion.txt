In conclusion, this result shows that ERBB signaling in TNBC is activated using an indirect route. Finally, the ERBB signaling pathway was activated in TNBC. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, which clarifies much confusion in this field and contributes to precision medicine. Hence, further insights into the biology of ERBB activation TNBC should be forthcoming through additional studies.
