IFN-β induced gene expression of inflammatory/immune responses
Binding of IFN-β to the Type I-IFN receptor activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Phosphorylated Stat proteins regulate gene transcription by binding to conserved sequences within the promoters of IFN-induced genes. IFN-stimulated Stat activation mediates the expression of a second family of transcription factors, the Irf proteins [18]. Irf proteins also mediate transcriptional responses to IFN stimulation. In our study, IFN-β stimulation was associated with Stat2 and Irf1 production, and recent findings indicate that Irf proteins play critical roles in interferon regulation [19].
IFN-β induced a number of genes involved in inflammatory/immune responses, transcription, signaling, and apoptosis. The most highly responsive genes induced by IFN-β were interferon-inducible GTPase 1 (Iigp1), Ifit1, myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 2 (Mx2), Ifit2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Cxcl11, ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (ISG15), Socs1, CD40, and TLR3. Secondary responsive genes included Gbp1, Gbp2, Gbp5, Il-13, and Fas. The fold-changes in the expression of these genes are provided in Supplementary Table 2.
