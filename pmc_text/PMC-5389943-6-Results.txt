(Optional) Data download from public repository (step 2)
We downloaded two samples of the GSE29611 dataset from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) database. We used EBI instead of SRA, as EBI provides both fastq and sra files, while SRA provides only sra files. By ftp protocol, it took about 45 min to download two fastq files from the EBI ftp site.
