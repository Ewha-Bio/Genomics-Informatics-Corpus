Sequencing and alignments
Genome-wide positive selection in pigs was identified using whole-genome resequencing, in which we aligned whole genome reads from three pig breeds, Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc, to the pig reference sequence. These breeds have undergone positive selection with strong signals for lactation, reproduction, meat quality, and growth. On average, ~329,482,871 sequences were mapped to the pig reference genome from the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser (assembly ID: susScr3) using Bowtie2. Table 1 provides a summary of the alignments of 24 pig samples. Over 92.8% of all reads were aligned to the pig reference genome. Pig resequencing data with an average read depth of 11.7Ã— were generated using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. A total of 18,440,443 SNPs were identified using the GATK.
