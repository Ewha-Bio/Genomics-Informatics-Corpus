This report introduces QCanvas, a program that provides a convenient and powerful interface for the pattern analysis of large-scale omics data. This program enables the user to conduct data clustering, data filtering, and graphics editing simultaneously on an integrated platform. These steps are typically performed on omics data, such as DNA (or protein) microarray data. All essential functionalities were integrated into the user-friendly interface of QCanvas. The simple and intuitive nature of this tool meets the practical needs of research scientists working on omics data who do not have expertise in bioinformatics approaches. The program is freely available with demo data and a step-by-step tutorial through the website (http://compbio.sookmyung.ac.kr/~qcanvas).
