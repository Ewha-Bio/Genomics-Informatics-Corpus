Censoring bad wells
Sporadic bad wells are often manually censored one by one, which is inefficient and error-prone in large-scale screens. If the experiment is done in triplicate or more, bad wells can be detected automatically by the inflated coefficient of variation (CV) among the replicates. siMacro identifies bad wells by applying a user-defined cutoff to the CV among normalized values from a replicate. The default is 1%, meaning 1% of the total genes with the highest CV will have a masked outlier well. This significantly reduces false positives but can also overcorrect. Therefore, siMacro reports flags for all genes with censored wells to aid user decisions with regard to exclusion from downstream analysis.
