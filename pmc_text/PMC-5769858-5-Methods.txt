Protein-protein docking
Protein-protein docking between trypsin (PDB ID: 2PTN) and recombinant proinsulins was performed using the InterEvDock server [19]. The InterEvDock server provides three kinds of scores: InterEvDock, FRODOCK [20], and SOAP_PP [21]. We chose the SOAP_PP score to evaluate the binding affinities, and docked poses were used to check whether two proteins were bound at the right position.
