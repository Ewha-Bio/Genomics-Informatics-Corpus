tRNAs are indispensable components of the translational machinery, hence one can surmise that tRNA cleavage affects protein synthesis. However, the mode of translational regulation by tRNA cleavage is not simply a result of change in the mature tRNA pool available for protein synthesis. Ivanov et al. showed that tRNA halves generated by ANG during stress play an active role in inhibiting protein synthesis and triggering the phospho-eIF2Î±-independent assembly of SGs [44].
In addition to tRNA halves, tRFs have also been reported to be involved in global translational inhibition in human cells. In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii a 26-nt long tRF-5 originating from tRNAVal in a stress-dependent manner was shown to directly bind to the small ribosomal subunit and reduce protein synthesis by interfering with peptidyl transferase activity [45]. A similar mechanism of translation inhibition by a tRF-5 was also observed in human cells [46]. A 19-nt long tRF-5 derived from tRNAGln decreased the expression of a reporter gene that did not have a sequence complementary to that of the tRF-5, suggesting that non-specific translational repression is mediated by this tRF-5. An interesting observation from this study was that the tRFs required a conserved "GG" dinucleotide for their activity in inhibiting translation. Because the tRF-5 series were detected in the polysome fraction, interaction of the tRF-5 with the ribosome may contribute to translation [46].
