HLA imputation
For HLA genotype imputation, SNP2HLA software version 1.0.3 was used with default options [9]. Single nucleotide variations, amino acid residues, and four-digit classical HLA alleles of eight HLA genes in chromosome 6 were imputed. HLA haplotype was inferred with Beagle version 3.0.4 [10]. Imputation was performed based on whole exome sequence genotype data after quality control and as reference, the pan-Asian (n = 530) pre-built reference panel provided by the SNP2HLA was used [11]. An imputation quality score of r2 > 0.3 was used as the cut-off. Among the 11 fulminant T1DM cases, we validated the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 imputed genotype in two participants using the AlleleSEQR HLA Sequencing Kit (Atria Genetics, South San Francisco, CA, USA) and it revealed identical results. For association testing we used the best-guessed genotype in 0/1/2 format.
