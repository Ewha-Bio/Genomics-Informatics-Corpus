Factors influencing ADRs to VPA
Many factors, including gender; age; treatment with CBZ, lamotrigine, PHT, or topiramate; and HS, did not influence ADRs. The presence of the genotype G/G at the g.-1774 region of the MRP2 promoter influenced ADRs to VPA in epileptic patients. Logistic regression showed that the G/G correlated independently with ADRs to VPA (p < 0.05; OR, 9.102; 95% confidence interval, 1.111 to 73.378). The del/del allele was the reference category (Table 5). The G/G genotype at g.-1774 might influence lower expression of MRP2 than del/del in the brain, leading to ADRs.
