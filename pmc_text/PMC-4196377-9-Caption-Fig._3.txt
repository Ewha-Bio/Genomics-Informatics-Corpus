Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of gastritis-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in males. This shows how well 20 ranked gastritis-associated SNPs (Table 3) classify patients and normal subjects in males. As much as the ROC curve, these factors can classify gastritis patients and normal subjects in males.
