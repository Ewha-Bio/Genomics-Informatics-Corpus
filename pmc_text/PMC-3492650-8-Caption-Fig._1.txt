Chromatin structure in genomic regions defined by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) in MCF7. (A) Profile of FAIRE and histone modifications (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/14ac, and H3K27me3) on a chromosome scale (chromosome 8, 11, and 12). The peaks denoted by spots were plotted by k-clustering using seqMiner program. (B) Histone modification peak profiles were analyzed, centered on FAIRE signals. The Y axis represents the normalized sum of peak counts, multiplied by 10,000. (C) The overlapping of each FAIRE-histone modification was estimated. (D) FAIRE-histone modifications ranging from -5 kb to 5 kb of transcription start sites (TSSs) were plotted. (E) Chromatin state at CCND1 locus. The box indicates Â±3 kb region from TSS.
