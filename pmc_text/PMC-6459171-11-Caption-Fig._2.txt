Annotation of biological functions and signal transduction pathways in mouse lung type II cells. (A) Signaling pathway terms associated with transcription factors of mouse lung type II were ranked by significance. (B) Schematic representation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) mediated intracellular signal transduction pathways in mouse lung type II cells. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAP, mitogen-activated protein.
