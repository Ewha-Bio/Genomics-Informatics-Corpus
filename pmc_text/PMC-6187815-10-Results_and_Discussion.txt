Pharmacological analysis of FQs compounds
Pharmacological analyses of the ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin compounds based on Lipinski’s rule of five were also performed. Lipinski’s rule of five evaluates the drug-likeness of a chemical compound and determines if a compound with certain pharmacological characteristics would be a possible orally active drug in humans. Drug molecules should be hydrophobic enough to last for the needed time in the body and not easily excreted, as this will enhance the bioactivity efficiency in the body. It is a good approach for drug lead design, especially for hydrophobicity and oral bioavailability prediction. Lipinski’s rule of five consists of the following predictions: molecular weight is from 160 to 500 Da, octanol-water partition coefficient (log P) is between −0.4 and +5.6, molar refractivity is from 40 to 130 cm3, hydrogen donor is less than 5 atoms, hydrogen acceptor is less than 10 atoms, and topological polar surface area is not more than 140 Å. The Molinspiration software was employed to study Lipinski’s rules for the ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, and norfloxacin. It was found that all the four FQs compounds do not violate any part of Lipinski’s rule of five and also followed all the requisite properties needed for a potent drug. The results also indicate that compounds are hydrophobic as they have a low solubility in water. With their good hydrophobicity, it can be concluded that these compounds (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin) will be able to circulate long enough for the optimal duration and will be excreted conveniently. This will enhance their interaction duration with the target protein DNA gyrase enzyme and consequently, result in an efficient inhibition of the target antibacterial protein.
The other pharmacological parameters analyzed were the ADME properties of the FQ compounds. The adsorption properties of all four compounds were analyzed. These properties included the water solubility, Caco2 permeability, intestinal absorption in humans, skin permeability and P-glycoprotein inhibition.
All four compounds (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin) were found to have high water solubility with values of −2.55, −3.03, −3.35, and −3.31, respectively. These values represent the high water solubility of FQ compounds at 25°C, defined on the basis of a database of more than 1,700 drug molecules.
The Caco2 permeability analysis showed that ofloxacin possesses a higher permeability (with a score of 1.402) than other FQs compounds studied. Caco2 permeability is an important property since these monolayers of cells are widely used in the study of the oral administration of compounds during the in vitro human model studies.
Another important consideration in the absorption of the drugs is intestinal absorption during oral administration. Ofloxacin was found to have a high absorption in the intestine with a high score of 96.964, as shown in Table 2. After that, the skin permeability of the compounds was studied, as it is an important parameter for the transdermal delivery of the drugs. The analysis revealed that ofloxacin has a good skin permeability in comparison to the other compounds, which possesses low permeability values. Moreover, all four compounds were found to possess the P-glycoprotein substrate characteristics with no inhibition of P-glycoprotein. These adsorption based pharmacological studies showed that all four compounds possess good adsorption properties, and ofloxacin possesses high-quality factors as a potential antibacterial drug.
After that, the pharmacological properties, including the distribution of drugs were studied, which include the volume of distribution (VDss), fraction unbound in human, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and central nervous system (CNS) permeability. The VDss reflects the drug volume needed so that the dose of the drug would distribute uniformly to provide a similar degree of concentration in the blood. Among the compounds, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good values for uniform distribution. The fraction of drug unbound in the human analysis showed that out of all the FQ compounds, ofloxacin has a minimal unbound fraction with a value of 0.375 (Table 3). This suggests that all four compounds have good distribution level pharmacological properties with very low BBB permeability and CNS permeability.
Next, the metabolism pharmacological parameters of four compounds were studied. All four compounds were not found to inhibit the cytochrome P450 and its different isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4). This suggests that the noninhibition of cytochrome P450 will help in the metabolism of these compounds (Table 4). However, none of the compounds were found as a substrate of cytochrome P450. All four drugs (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin) were also found to possess the optimal total clearance values 0.483, 0.361, 0.323, and 0.188 mL/min/kg respectively (Table 5). The total clearance reflects the hepatic clearance and renal clearance and indicates the requisite bioavailability property for uniform dosing concentrations. We found that all four compounds possess no violations of the Lipinski rule of five and other algorithms and high drug likelines with a large number of approved drugs.
