Cytokine analysis
The Bio-Plex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for quantification of cytokines in tissue culture supernatants. In the kit, an antibody directed against each cytokine is covalently coupled to a different color-coded polystyrene bead. The conjugated beads are reacted with a sample containing a known (standard) or unknown amount of cytokines. After unbound cytokines are removed, biotinylated detection antibodies are added to the reaction. The complexes are detected by streptavidin-phycoerythrin, which has fluorescence characteristics. Quantification is carried out by a specialized microtiter plate reader.
