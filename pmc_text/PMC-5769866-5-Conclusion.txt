Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made in understanding three-dimensional genome architecture. However, its role in cancer remains incompletely understood. An intriguing issue in this context is that, although most topological boundaries are enriched for the binding of CTCF, only 15% of CTCF-binding sites are located within TAD boundaries [15], suggesting that additional factors other than the CTCF/cohesin complex might be required to establish the topological domain structure of the genome [17]. Further work is needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying this level of chromosomal organization, and to what extent it generally contributes to the transcriptional regulation of genes during tumorigenesis.
While increasing evidence has recently indicated that enhancers are located near oncogenic genes and exhibit a large number of variants associated with diseases [91], a more complete understanding of how epigenetic alteration of enhancers directly participates in the development and onset of genome reorganization during tumor progression remains to be obtained. Based on this point, recently developed CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome-editing technology has attracted considerable interest because this approach can acutely modify the epigenetic landscape of specific regulatory elements [92]. For example, targeted editing of the DNA methylation status of CTCF-binding sites changes CTCT recruitment, thereby altering the expression of genes by influencing the organization of higher-order chromatin structures [93]. Furthermore, a high-throughput CRISPR activation system was also used to reveal how noncoding variation associated with human immune dysfunction alters stimulation-dependent enhancer function [94]. Thus, highly specific CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome-editing technology may serve as an attractive treatment option for epigenetic-based cancer therapies in the coming years.
