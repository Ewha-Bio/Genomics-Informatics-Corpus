During the past 6 million years, Alu elements have modified the human genome in a species-specific manner and also caused human disease through de novo insertion or the recombination between them. Genomic rearrangements induced by Alu insertion account for approximately 0.1% of human diseases and genomic deletions by ARMD are responsible for approximately 0.3% of human genetic disorders [103233]. There are many Alu elements which are closely related to human diseases (Table 1) [394041424344454647484950515253]. Alström syndrome is a rare genetic disease which is caused by Alu insertion in ALMS1 gene. ALMS1 is composed of 23 exons and encodes centrosome and basal body-associated protein which plays an important role in microtubule organization, especially form and maintain cilia. The protein is associated with insulin resistance, hypogonadism, and heart disease. Therefore, Alström syndrome has several symptoms such as blindness and obesity. Most mutations causing Alström syndrome occur in exons 8, 10, and 16 of ALMS1 [54]. The mutation of ALMS1 caused by Alu element was first discovered in 2013. AluYa5 element exists in the exon 16 of ALMS1, which disrupts open reading frame, leading to frameshift mutation [40]. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is also caused by Alu element, which locates in BMPR2 gene. BMPR2 locates on chromosome 2 and has 13 exons. Exons 1–3 encoding an extracellular domain were deleted by the recombination between two different AluY elements in PAH patients. In another PAH patient, the exon 10 of the gene was deleted by AluSx involved-nonhomologous recombination. The recombination took place between the Alu element in the intron 9 and a unique sequence in the intron 10 of the gene [41]. Fork stalling and template switching/microhomology-mediated break-induced replication model (FoSTeS/MMBIR) has been often proposed in cases where the complexity of the genomic rearrangement is not able to be explained by using classic recombination mechanisms. Recently, Alu element was reported to be associated with a human genomic deletion responsible for Waardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4). WS4 is a rare neural crest disorder. Three Alu elements are involved in the large deletion within SOX10 regulatory sequences in patients with WS4. The deletion could be explained by a two-step FoSTeS/MMBIR mechanism mediated via the 4-bp and 13-bp microhomology found at the Alu1/Alu3 and Alu3/Alu2 breakpoints, respectively. The deletion of SOX10 regulatory sequences was also identified in patients with Hirschsprung disease and peripheral demyelinating neuropathy–central dysmeylinating leukodystrophy [50].
