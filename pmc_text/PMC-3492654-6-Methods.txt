Genotyping
Genotyping was carried out using the iPLEX assay on the MassARRAY Platform (Sequenom, Inc.). The iPLEX extension was performed in a total volume of 9 µL with 50 µM dNTP/dideoxynucleotide phosphate (ddNTP) each, 0.063 unit/µL Thermo Sequenase (Sequenom, Inc.), and 625 nM to 1.25 µM extension primers. iPLEX extension was performed using 2-step 200 short-cycle programs. The sample was denatured at 94℃ for 5 s, and strands were annealed at 52℃ for 5 s and extended at 80℃ for 5 s. The annealing and extension cycle was repeated 4 more times for a total of 5 cycles, looped back to a 94℃ denaturing step for 5 s, and then entered the 5-cycle annealing and extension loop again. The 5 annealing and extension steps with the single denaturing step were repeated an additional 39 times for a total of 40 cycles. A final extension was done at 72℃ for 3 min. iPLEX extension products were desalted by adding 6 mg resin (SpectroCLEAN; Sequenom, Inc.) and 16 µL water. After full rotation in room temperature, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 3,500 g, 5 min. After desalting, products were transferred to SpectroCHIP using a Nanodispenser (SpectroPOINT; Sequenom, Inc.) and then read through matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (SpectroReader; Sequenom, Inc.). The resulting genotype data were collected by MassArray Typer software version 4.0 (Sequenom, Inc.).
