DNA sequences analysis
For each of the seven genes, we aligned the DNA sequences obtained from the seven Flavobacterium isolates using the software BioEdit, version 7.0 (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/Bioedit/bioedit.html/). After that, the housekeeping gene sequences of the 14 added reference strains were collected using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and aligned in the same way.
