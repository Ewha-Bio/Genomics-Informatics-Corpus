Data acquisition
Somatic mutation data for tumor tissue samples from 2938 patients, harboring 11 cancer types, were obtained from the data portal of TCGA, which were freely available. These data (level 2) for 10 cancer types, except ovarian serous cy_stadenocarcinoma (OV), provide genome-wide somatic mutations on each sample experimented with the Illumina Genome Analyzer DNA Sequencing platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The somatic mutation data for OV were organized, combined with data produced from Illumina and the ABI SOLiD DNA System Sequencing platforms (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The details, including the full name of each cancer type and updated dates of mutation data, are provided in Table 1.
Together with somatic mutation data, clinical data for each patient were downloaded from the data portal of TCGA. These data were applied to categorize samples into metastasis and non-metastasis. The annotation of 'pathologic_M' was available to indicate the stage of metastasis in the patient's tumor samples. The stage of M0' means that there was no evidence of distant metastasis, and 'M1' means that a pathological distant metastasis was found. In this study, the samples from patients annotated as 'M0' were classified as non-metastatic, and those with 'M1' were classified as metastatic.
