HOTAIR Long Non-coding RNA: Characterizing the Locus Features by the In Silico Approaches
HOTAIR is an lncRNA that has been known to have an oncogenic role in different cancers. There is limited knowledge of genetic and epigenetic elements and their interactions for the gene encoding HOTAIR. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanism and its regulation remains to be challenging. We used different in silico analyses to find genetic and epigenetic elements of HOTAIR gene to gain insight into its regulation. We reported different regulatory elements including canonical promoters, transcription start sites, CpGIs as well as epigenetic marks that are potentially involved in the regulation of HOTAIR gene expression. We identified repeat sequences and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are located within or next to the CpGIs of HOTAIR. Our analyses may help to find potential interactions between genetic and epigenetic elements of HOTAIR gene in the human tissues and show opportunities and limitations for researches on HOTAIR gene in future studies.
