Pharmacophore screen
For the initial set of the pharmacophore screen, we selected a lead-like subset [18], defined by the ZINC database (ZINC is not commercial) [19]. Similar to druglikeness [20], like Lipinski’s rule of 5 [21], lead-like compounds are defined as being large enough to be validated in experiments but are smaller than most drugs, optimized too specifically, and more soluble than their drug-like compounds. ZINC provides a lead-like subset fulfilling leadlikeness as follows: (1) molecular weight between 250 and 350 Da, (2) partition coefficient log p ≤ 3.5, and (3) no more than seven rotatable bonds. The structures of lead-like compounds in medium pH were downloaded and converted into a database for screening by idbgen, a component of Ligandscout. We carried out pharmacophore screens using iscreen in Ligandscout for models 1 and 2 independently. Pharmacophore fit scores were also calculated by LigandScout based on the number of matching pharmacophore features and the root-mean-square deviation of the pharmacophore alignment.
