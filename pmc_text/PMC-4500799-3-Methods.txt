Physicochemical and functional categorization
By using the Expasy's Protparam server (http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam) physicochemical characterization, molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), total number of positive and negative residues, extinction coefficient [12], instability index [13], aliphatic index (AI) [14] and grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) [15] of HPs were analyzed.
