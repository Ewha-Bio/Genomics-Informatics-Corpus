Using the GWAS catalog, we extracted 26 candidate SNPs that might be useful for forensic science in terms of EVCs. Two SNPs in MC1R and HERC2 were already genotyped in subjects of the KARE study. Among 26 SNPs, 2 pairs of SNPs, rs1847134 and rs1393350 within TYR and rs4900109 and rs12896399 within SLC24A4, respectively, were under pairwise LD (r2 > 0.8), and 1 SNP in each pair was selected. Two SNPs showing low probe design ability were excluded from the probe selection process. Finally, 20 out of 26 SNPs were selected for genotyping in Koreans.
One SNP, rs7559271 (PAX3), was associated with facial morphology [31]; 2 SNPs, rs3739070 (TRAF3IP1) and rs10235789 (SEMA3A), were identified for the association with iris patterns, such as furrows and crypts, respectively [29]; and the remaining 17 SNPs were associated with hair and/or eye color [10, 24-28, 30]. Among these variants, 8 SNPs were included in the HIrisPlex program the determine hair and iris color.
Allele frequencies and other genetic parameters for the 20 SNPs are provided in Table 1. All analyzed SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the Korean population (p > 0.001). Three SNPs that were associated with facial morphology or iris characteristics in Europeans [29, 31] were polymorphic in the Korean population as follows: rs7559271 (PAX3), rs3739070 (TRAF3IP1), and rs10235789 (SEMA3A). Their minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were 0.303, 0.029, and 0.103, respectively. Among 17 SNPs related to hair or eye color, 4 SNPs were monomorphic and 6 SNPs were very rare (MAF < 0.005) in Koreans. The 4 monomorphic SNPs in Koreans were rs12203592 (IRF4), rs12821256 (KITLG), rs12913832 (HERC2), and rs8033165 (intergenic). Their allele frequencies in Europeans (CEU) in the HapMap database were 0.167, 0.146, 0.792, and 0.447, respectively. The 6 rare SNPs in Koreans were rs16891982 (SLC45A2), rs1408799 (TYRP1), rs35264875 (TPCN2), rs1393350 (TYR), and rs1805007 (MC1R), and their allele frequencies in Europeans were 0.983, 0.695, 0.175, 0.226, and 0.121, respectively. The HapMap database did not include the allele frequency of rs12931267 (MC1R).
Since frequency information alone does not explain phenotype variability, association analysis is required to confirm the genetic effect of the SNPs between appearance phenotype and SNPs. Stokowski et al. [20] reported that SNPs in TYR, SLC45A2, and SLC24A5 were associated with skin pigmentation and largely accounted for differences between those with the darkest and lightest skin in a South Asian sample. A previous study analyzed skin and hair color in Koreans, categorizing hair color into 3 types and skin color into 4 types [33]. The 7 polymorphic SNPs in the Korean population are likely to contribute to color variation within the Korean population. In addition, the 4 monomorphic SNPs could be used for distinguishing East Asians from Europeans.
In this study, we provided the allele frequency of 20 EVCs SNPs by genotyping a large number of Koreans (1,920 individuals) in comparison to the 45 Chinese and 45 Japanese recruited for the International HapMap Project. Even though the usability of these SNPs should be verified by association study in Koreans, this study might provide 10 potential SNP markers for forensic science for EVCs in the Korean population.
