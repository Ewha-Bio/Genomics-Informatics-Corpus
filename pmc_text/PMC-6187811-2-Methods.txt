Oligonucleotides, medium, the gene deletion library, and DNA samples
All synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Cultures were grown in YES medium (0.5% yeast extract, 3% glucose, and the appropriate amino acid supplements) at 30oC, following the instructions [12]. Genomic DNA from the fission yeast gene deletion library was extracted using the Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial kit (Zymo Research Co., Irvine, CA, USA) and then resuspended in distilled water until use.
The gene deletion library used in this study was constructed based on the principle of homologous recombination, as previously reported [5]. In brief, for each strain, the ORF was replaced and tagged by homologous recombination with a deletion cassette consisting of the KanMX module [the selectable resistance gene KanMX4 and a pair of unique 20-mer molecular barcodes (up-tag and down-tag) on both sides flanking the KanMX4 gene] and its flanking homologous regions to the chromosome (Fig. 1A). Deletion cassettes were prepared by two different methods: serial or block PCR (Fig. 1B and 1C). The latter one was designed to have longer flanking homologous regions, resulting in a higher recombination rate than former. Among the 4,354 strains used in this study, 2,886 and 1,468 strains were made by the block and serial PCR methods, respectively.
The oligonucleotide sequences used in the construction of the KanMX4 module were as follows: UP-tag (20-mer), unique barcode sequence assigned to each ORF; DN-tag (or DOWN-tag, 20-mer), unique barcode sequence assigned to each ORF; U1 (20-mer), common priming site 1 for amplifying UP-tags, 5ˊ-CGCTCCCGCCTTACTTCGCA-3ˊ (sense); U2 (18-mer), common priming site 2 for amplifying UP-tags and homologous to the 5ˊ region of the KanMX4 module, 5ˊ-TTAGCTTGCCTCGTCCCC-3ˊ (sense); D2 (18-mer), common priming site 2 for amplifying DN-tags and homologous to the 3ˊ region of the KanMX4 module, 5ˊ-TTTCGACACTGGATGGCG-3ˊ (sense); D1 (20-mer), common priming site 1 for amplifying DN-tags, 5ˊ-TTGCGTTGCGTAGGGGGGAT-3ˊ (sense); G1 (6-mer), gap sequence 1, 5ˊ-TTTAAA-3ˊ (sense); G2 (6-mer), gap sequence 2, 5ˊ-GATATC-3ˊ (sense); G3 (6-mer), gap sequence 3, 5ˊ-AGTATC-3ˊ (sense); G4 (6-mer), gap sequence 4, 5ˊ-TTTAAA-3ˊ (sense).
The oligonucleotide sequences used in the serial or block PCR method were as follows: UP-tag forward (70-mer), 5ˊ-U1-G1-(20-mer UP-tag)-G2-U2-3ˊ; 70-mer DN-tag reverse, 5ˊ-D1–G4-(20-mer DN-tag)–G3–D2-3ˊ.
