The regulatory network, upper section is a dendrogram for regulators' expression and bottom section is a heat map for target genes' expression, generated using Genomica, based on expression profiling. The upper part of the figure represents a dendrogram for a combination of regulators and their expressions for each individual. The lower part shows a heat map for the expression profiling of up-regulated target genes by insulin treatment (row and column indicate genes and individuals, respectively).
