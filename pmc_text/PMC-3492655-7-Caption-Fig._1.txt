Signal intensity (Log R ratio) plots of the copy number variation (CNV) regions. (A, B) CNVs detected from all 3 algorithms. (C, D) CNVs detected from 2 of the 3 algorithms. (E, F) CNVs uniquely detected by a single algorithm. Green bars, copy number-loss CNV regions; red bars, copy number-gained CNV regions.
