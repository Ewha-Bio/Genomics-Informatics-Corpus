Chemistry and anthropometric measurements
Serum, separated from peripheral venous blood, was obtained from each participant after a 12-h fast and then stored at -70â„ƒ until analyzed. For anthropometric measurements, WC was measured on exposed waists midway between the lower rib and the iliac crest using a measuring tape. For difficult cases, WC was measured at 3 cm above the navel. Weight and height were measured while participants were wearing light clothing. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m2). Both systolic and diastolic BP was measured after a 15-min rest. In addition, each participant was interviewed using a structured questionnaire to collect information on smoking and alcohol consumption as well as demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and family and past history of clinical diseases. Cigarette smoking was classified into never smokers, ex-smokers, and current smokers. Alcohol consumption was divided into nondrinkers and current drinkers. Regular physical activity was tracked as either "yes" or "no".
