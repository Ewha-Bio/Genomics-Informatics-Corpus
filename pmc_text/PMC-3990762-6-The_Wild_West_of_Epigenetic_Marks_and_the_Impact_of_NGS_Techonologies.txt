Nucleosome positioning and occupancy
The packaging of DNA coiled around histones produces distinct structures called nucleosomes that form repeating units with approximately 147 bp wrapped around each unit, separated by varying lengths of linker DNA. The occupancy and periodic positioning of nucleosomes can control the accessibility of DNA to transcription factors [23] and DNases, as well as the transcription rate of active gene bodies [44], and are thus considered an epigenetic mark. Biochemically active regulatory regions are generally depleted of nucleosomes [45], whereas inactive repeat regions (heterochromatin) have higher affinity to form nucleosome structures [46].
A map of nucleosome occupancy is generated by using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) for digestion of the chromatin [23], followed by high-throughput sequencing-a technique called MNase-seq. MNase digests all linker DNA but preserves the DNA wound around the nucleosome; when the latter is sequenced and mapped to the reference, a map of the original positioning of nucleosomes is obtained. Due to some inherent biases in MNase affinity (preference to AT-rich regions) and the lack of single base-pair resolution data, attempts were made to develop more precise technologies [24]. An MNase-independent technique that involves chemically modifying engineered histones to bring about cleavage of DNA wound around histones allows direct mapping of nucleosome centers.
