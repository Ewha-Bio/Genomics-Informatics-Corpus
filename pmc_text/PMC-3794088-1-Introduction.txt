Plasma liver enzyme tests are broadly applied to predict biochemical liver functions and to diagnose liver diseases. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) are closely associated with hepatocyte damage and steatosis, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [1]. Elevated liver enzyme levels, as prospective risk factors, have been reported to be involved in type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease [2, 3]. However, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase are related with biliary, cholestatic, and alcoholic diseases [4].
Overweightedness in childhood or adolescence is persistent in adulthood obesity and is closely associated with adverse health effects, including metabolic diseases [5]. A recent cohort study in Korean adolescents has shown strong associations of liver enzyme levels with a cluster of metabolic syndrome components [6]. Thus, finding genetic markers of liver enzyme levels in childhood would be important for early prediction of liver function and its related disease in adulthood.
Liver enzyme levels are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The heritabilities of liver enzyme levels range from approximately 35% to 61% [7, 8]. To date, two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in European ancestry populations have identified genetic variants located in multiple genes associated with levels of ALT (HSD17B13-MAPK10, TRIB1, CHUK, and SAMM50), AST (NBPF3-ALPL), and both of them (CPN1 and PNPLA3) [9, 10]. In addition, a meta-analysis identified pleiotropic effects between NAFLD and metabolic traits, such as low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance [11].
Despite the identification of novel genes or loci associated with liver enzymes in cohort populations, the common variants in childhood are still largely unknown. Here, we present findings from a GWAS in childhood subjects to identify new susceptibility loci for liver enzyme levels.
