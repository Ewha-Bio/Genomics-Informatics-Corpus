Subjects
In the discovery stage, the association results for pulse rate were obtained from the KARE study. The information for subjects of the KARE GWAS is described elsewhere [5]. Subjects for the replication stage were recruited from the Health Examinee cohorts, called HEXA-shared cohorts. The standardized examinations that were applied in this survey included 4,302 participants aged 40 to 70 years. The characteristics of the cohorts are described in Table 1.
