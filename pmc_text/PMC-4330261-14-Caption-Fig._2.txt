The sites of mutation and the oligonucleotides used for in vitro mutagenesis of HNF1B. (A) Upper bar shows the structure of wild-type human HNF-1β. It consists of a dimerization domain (a.a. 1-32), DNA-binding domain (a.a. 106-310), and transactivation domain (a.a. 310-557). The P159L (c.476C>T) mutation and the H153N mutation (c.457C>A) were generated as lower bars. The H153N mutant was a functionally proven mutation. (B) The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are shown. WT, wild-type; POUS, POU-specific; POUH, POU-homeo; HNF-1β, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β.
