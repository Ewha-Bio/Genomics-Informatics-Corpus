Structure prediction and evaluation
Phyre2 (Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine) server was used for modelling of three dimensional structure of putative drug target of B. petrii. The algorithm of Phyre2 server predict three dimensional structure of a protein sequence using the principles and techniques of homology and/or fold recognition, as structural folding pattern is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence. Hence, a protein of interest (drug target) can be modelled with reasonable accuracy basing on a distantly related protein with known (template) structure [35]. The energetically stable structure was obtained through structural refinement and energy minimization using ModRefiner algorithm [36] of Zhang Lab web server (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/). The structural superimposition of refined model with template model was performed using Discovery Studio 3.5 suite. The structural quality and reliability of refined model were evaluated using RAMPAGE [37], ProSA-web [38], Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) [39], and ERRAT [40] web tools.
