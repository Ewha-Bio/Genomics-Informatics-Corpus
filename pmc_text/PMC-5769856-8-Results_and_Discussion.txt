Design of the custom cancer panel
The custom NGS panel, named OncoChase-AS, was designed to detect 95 cancer-related genes with clinically important variants (Fig. 1). The 95 genes were selected based on the published literature and cancer databases, such as COSMIC [17] and GENIE [18]. Of the 95 target genes, 41 genes were selected for mutation screening, 10 genes were selected for CNA screening, and the other 44 genes were selected for screening of both mutations and CNAs (Fig. 1).
