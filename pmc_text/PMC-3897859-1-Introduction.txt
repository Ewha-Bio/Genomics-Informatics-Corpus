Human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus from the papillomavirus family, is capable of infecting humans. About 200 different strains of HPV identified, based on DNA homology, have been found to be etiologically linked to cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, oral, and plantar infectious lesions and cancers, as well [1, 2]. The HPV genome, a double-stranded DNA molecule, consists of 8 kilobase pairs (kbp) of nucleotides, which comprises 3 regions: 6 early open reading frames (ORFs)-E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7; 2 late ORFs-L1 and L2; and an upstream regulatory region [3]. A considerable volume of HPV specific information pertaining to its genome, proteome, structure, and disease association is available scattered on the web with trivial annotations; however, it is not customized to explore for data analysis, host-pathogen interaction, strain-disease association, drug designing, and sequence analysis, etc. Therefore, we proposed to develop a comprehensive reserve on HPV with maximum possible inputs and outputs for the end users.
