COPD-related subnetworks
PhenomeExpress [18] was used to build vital subnetworks in COPD. Phenotypes relevant to COPD were used as seeds to construct the subnetworks. The seed phenotypes were HP:0002875 (exertional dyspnea), HP:0006510 (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), MP:0001183 (overexpanded pulmonary alveoli), MP:0001951 (abnormal breathing pattern), MP:0010959 (abnormal oxidative phosphorylation), MP:0010956 (abnormal mitochondrial ATP synthesis-coupled electron transport), and MP:0002499 (chronic inflammation). Information on protein interactions was extracted from ConsensusPathDB [19]. Functional enrichment of subnetworks was examined by the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool 7 (BiNGO), an open-source Cytoscape (v2.8.1) plugin to assess over-representation of gene ontology terms in networks [20]. Subnetworks enriched with specific functions were selected for further consideration.
