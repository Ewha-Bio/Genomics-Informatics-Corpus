In this paper, we have reviewed how to analyze multi-block datasetsâ€”in particular, using Korean genomewide data: the KARE dataset. We conducted GCCA in order to compare the relationship between and within multi-blocks. To see the relationship between variables, we used SAS [18] to do GCCA and R to visualize the relationships between and within multi-block data in four different subgroups: group 1, group 2, group 3, and group 4. In the relationship between blocks, we could reveal that there existed a stronger association between second canonical variables than between first canonical variables. In addition, we found that the relationship between SNP block and Phenotype block was the strongest, whereas the relationship between SNP block and Disease block was not remarkable. To see the relationship within variables, we made plots that showed how much each variable contributed to the canonical variable. Some SNP variables showed distinguishable influence among variable blocks, but most SNP variables did not show big difference. Phenotype variables, however, were distinguished by each group and showed dramatic differences between groups. In this paper, GCCA was applied to the preselected SNP set which relied on previous literatures, however, further research could be started from screening SNPs which are associated with phenotype or disease status.
We had limitations, in that different types of data, including both discrete and continuous data, can lead to unsuccessful results in GCCA. However, the analysis regarding SNP, phenotype, and disease at the same time would be meaningful itself and can even be more productive when we add pathway assumption in the association analysis. Therefore, further research of this topic should focus on robust generalized canonical correlation analysis, which could function regardless of datatype, and on the relationship that we would like to specify.
