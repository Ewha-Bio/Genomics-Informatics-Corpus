Normalization
The large variability of the total counts per sample prevents meaningful comparisons of raw abundances between individuals. This is usually addressed through normalization of raw counts before the analysis. The most simple and frequently used normalization is the computation of relative abundances by dividing the raw abundances by the total number of counts per sample. Another popular normalization approach is rarefaction, which consists on subsampling the same number of reads for each sample so that all samples have the same number of total counts. Rarefaction is not recommended because it entails the loss of important information [14]. More sophisticated normalization techniques are implemented in some R packages, such as, DESeq [15] or edgeR [16], initially developed for RNA-seq analysis, that are also used for microbiome differential abundance testing. See Weiss et al. [17] for a comparison and discussion on the performance of different normalization methods for microbiome analysis.
CoDA techniques do not require the normalization step because the log-ratio approach involves working with ratios between components and this cancels the effect of the total counts per sample. Instead, CoDA methods entail the imputation of zeros. Microbiome abundance tables are sparse, they contain many zeros, and this should be properly addressed before compositional data methods can be applied. The simplest approach is to replace zeros by a small pseudo-count or to add a small constant to all the elements of the abundance matrix. As an alternative, Martín-Fernández et al. [18] propose the Bayesian-Multiplicative treatment, a zero replacement involving Bayesian inference and a modification of the non-zero values so that the original ratios between the non-zero components are preserved.
