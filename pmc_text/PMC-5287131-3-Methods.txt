Pathway analysis
The participation of virulent proteins in any unique pathways of pathogen could be ensured and analyzed through the exploration of databases, is a common procedure to be followed while predicting putative drug targets. In this study, the pathway analysis was performed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Here, the exploration of KEGG database for pathway study was conducted twice. In the first case, the search was carried out for all obtained virulent proteins against existing pathways of B. petrii using KEGG BLAST algorithm. Secondly, unique pathways of B. petrii (pathways present in B. petrii, not in human) were sort listed from the KEGG database by comparing all pathways between B. petrii and human. Further, selection of common unique pathways [263233] was made between the observed pathways of selected targets and obtained unique pathways of B. petrii. Furthermore, the selection pathways which are essential for the survival of the pathogen were made after detail inspection of obtained pathways. Finally, the key proteins regulating those pathways of B. petrii were considered as putative drug targets (Fig. 1B).
