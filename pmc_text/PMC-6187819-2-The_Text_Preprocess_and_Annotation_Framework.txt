Initially, we wrote a simple Python-based Web crawler, to browse and download PDF files from Genomics & Informatics archives. Then, we converted them into plain text files, using PDFMiner or other optical character recognition (OCR) tools [7]. The goal was to transform an image of a text into a readable text.
The next step was annotation. According to Bernardi et al. (2002) [8], the biological literature is characterized by heavy use of domain-specific terminology, wherein more than 12% of words found in biochemistry publications are technical terms. Therefore, we used NLTK module, for general text processing [9, 10], and GENIA tagger for recognizing biological terms [11–13]. The annotation result used as an example sentence from our dataset, “Most RFLP markers (80%) were pepper-derived clones and these markers were evenly distributed all over the genome.” is as follows:
(‘Most’, ‘Most’, ‘JJS’, ‘B-NP’, ‘O’) (‘RFLP’, ‘RFLP’, ‘NN’, ‘I-NP’, ‘B-DNA’) (‘markers’, ‘marker’, ‘NNS’, ‘I-NP’, ‘I-DNA’) (‘(’,‘(’, ‘(’, ‘O’, ‘O’) (‘80’, ‘80’, ‘CD’, ‘B-NP’, ‘O’) (‘%’, ‘%’, ‘NN’, ‘I-NP’, ‘O’) (‘)’,‘)’, ‘)’, ‘O’, ‘O’) (‘were’, ‘be’, ‘VBD’, ‘B-VP’, ‘O’) (‘pepper-derived’, ‘pepper-derived’, ‘JJ’, ‘B-NP’, ‘B-cell_line’) (‘clones’, ‘clone’, ‘NNS’, ‘I-NP’, ‘I-cell_line’) (‘and’, ‘and’, ‘CC’, ‘O’, ‘O’) (‘these’, ‘these’, ‘DT’, ‘B-NP’, ‘O’) (‘markers’, ‘marker’, ‘NNS’, ‘I-NP’, ‘O’) (‘were’, ‘be’, ‘VBD’, ‘B-VP’, ‘O’) (‘evenly’, ‘evenly’, ‘RB’, ‘I-VP’, ‘O’) (‘distributed’, ‘distribute’, ‘VBN’, ‘I-VP’, ‘O’) (‘all’, ‘all’, ‘DT’, ‘B-ADVP’, ‘O’) (‘over’, ‘over’, ‘IN’, ‘B-PP’, ‘O’) (‘the’, ‘the’, ‘DT’, ‘B-NP’, ‘O’) (‘genome’, ‘genome’, ‘NN’, ‘I-NP’, ‘O’) (‘.’, ‘.’, ‘.’, ‘O’, ‘O’).
Four different levels of tags are attached for each word in the example sentence: base form, POS tag, chunk tag, and named-entity tag. For example, (‘RFLP’, ‘RFLP’, ‘NN’, ‘I-NP’, ‘B-DNA’) represent the part of speech of the word RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) is a noun (‘NN’), and that the word is internal to a noun phrase (‘I-NP’), and a begin phrase of a DNA term (‘B-DNA’).
Specifically, the first tag is a morphological tag to represent a base form of a word. The second tag (based on Penn Treebank tag sets [14]) is a grammatical part-of-speech (POS) tag, needed for analysis of a sentence identifying constituent parts of sentences such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The third tag is a syntactic-level tag that links POS tag to higher order units termed chunks that have discrete grammatical meanings such as noun phrases, verb phrases, or other grammatical phrases [15]. For chunk tags, IOB notation was used, wherein the B/I/O terminology refers to begin phrase (B), internal to phrase (I), and outside of phrase (O) [16]. The last tag is a semantic-level tag to classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as proteins, DNAs, RNAs, cell lines, and cell types [17, 18].
