Random forest predictions
Random forest is a classification algorithm [37] that uses an ensemble of tree-structured classifiers. The random forest is a popular algorithm that has been used in designing computational predictors for various biological problems. Random forest is an ensemble learning method for classification. The random forest classifies a new object with an input vector, the input vector is predicted by each decision tree in the forest. Each tree provides a classification with votes and the class with most votes will be output as the predicted class. It is implemented by using Weka package [38, 39]. To ensure that parameter estimation and model generation of random forest is completely independent of the test data, a nested cross-validation procedure is performed. Nested cross-validation [40] means that there is an outer cross-validation loop for model assessment and an inner loop for model selection. In this study, the original samples are randomly divided into k = 10 parts in the outer loop. Each of these parts is chosen one by one for assessment, and the remaining nine of 10 samples are for model selection in the inner loop where a type of cross-validation using the so-called out-of-bag samples is performed.
