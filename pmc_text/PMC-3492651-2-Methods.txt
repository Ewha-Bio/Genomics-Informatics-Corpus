Cells, reagents, and RNA preparation
RAW 264.7 macrophages were stimulated with KDO (100 ng/mL), IFN-β (300 pM), and/or 8-Br (100 µM). These ligands were applied individually or in combinations containing KDO for 60 min and 120 min. Total RNA was extracted using TriPure (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Each experiment was conducted in duplicate.
