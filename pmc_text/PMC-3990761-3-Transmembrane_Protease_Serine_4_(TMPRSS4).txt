TMPRSS4 in cancer
TMPRSS4 (gene ID, 56649; chromosomal location, 11q23.3), initially referred to as TMPRSS3, was originally identified as a gene expressed in most pancreatic cancer tissues but not in the normal pancreas or chronic pancreatitis [28]. To date, 7 isoforms have been reported. The deduced sequence of 437 amino acids of the longest isoform (isoform 1) contains a serine protease domain with putative trypsin-like activity and a transmembrane domain [28]. In human, TMPRSS4 mRNA was detected in bladder, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and kidney [28], although the physiological roles of TMPRSS4 remain unknown. Furthermore, TMPRSS4 expression was upregulated in malignant compared to benign thyroid neoplasm and was suggested as both a diagnostic and prognostic marker [29, 30]. TMPRSS4 was associated with poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous cell histology [31], triple-negative breast cancer [32], cervical cancer [33], and gastric cancer patients [34]. Kim et al. [35] reported that TMPRSS4 mRNA levels were upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues versus adjacent normal mucosa. The authors also reported that TMPRSS4 protein expression was significantly higher in human colorectal cancer tissues from advanced stages (52.5% and 50.0% of stages III and IV, respectively) than in that of early stage (6.3% in stage I), suggesting that TMPRSS4 may play a role in the progression of non-invasive tumors to invasive malignancies [35]. Jia et al. [36] showed that the inhibitory tripeptide tyroserleutide led to downregulation of TMPRSS4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thereby reducing the invasion and metastasis of HCC induced by irradiation. Taken together, TMPRSS4 may be a novel biomarker for the prognosis of certain types of cancers and could be employed for diagnostics and therapeutics.
On the other hand, the mechanism by which TMPRSS4 expression is modulated has not been well characterized. Recently, Nguyen et al. [37] reported that TMPRSS4 was increased in NSCLC cells under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that hypoxia within the tumor microenvironment may upregulate TMPRSS4 expression.
