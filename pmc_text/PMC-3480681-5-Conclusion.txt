RNA splicing is a core mechanism to generate mature mRNA for translation, and alternative splicing is an indispensable mechanism, stratgically leading to protein diversity for complicated regulation in eukaryotes. In cancer, alternative splicing is more flexible, leading various proteins with aberrant functions to promote growth and the spread of cancer cells. It is important to identify alternative transcripts that function specifically in cancer. These alternative transcripts could be used not only as diagnostic biomarkers but also prognostic and theraputic biomarkers. Therefore, studies on genetic and epigenetic regulation in relation to alternative splice variants in cancer could open new windows of research in answering unsolved questions of tumorigenesis.
