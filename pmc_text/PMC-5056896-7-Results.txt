Study of binding affinity between miRNA-mRNA duplex
Duplex sequences between miR-106 and PTEN, miR-21 and TGFBR2, miR-29b-2 and VEGFA were extracted from miRTarbase web server and prediction of secondary folding pattern was performed in RNA fold. The secondary folding patterns along with their binding energy value are reported (Table 4). The predicted binding energy suggested for a high affinity among selected miRNA-mRNA duplexes. Predicted three dimensional models [63] of the duplex structures between miR-106 and PTEN, miR-21 and TGFBR2, miR-29b-2 and VEGFA also supported for strong molecular interaction between them.
