Regardless of their discovery history, it would be better to have an extended view of ORs to get objective analysis results. Besides OR expression, its transportation to the cytoplasmic membrane of a cell is indispensable for correct function. Recently, Sharma et al. [76] reported a study on the relation between OR protein trafficking and OR transcriptional regulation using an Rtp1 and Rtp2 double-knockout mouse system; thus, a more sophisticated study of OR trafficking should be complemented.
In case of the cancer research, some identified ORs could serve as potential therapeutic targets for cancer diagnosis and its therapeutic applications. All biological phenomena, including cancers, are composite networks. Although much research has been done and is ongoing with regard to ORs, the relationship of the results is not clear. However, it has been proven that molecular functions and physiological changes in various parts could be caused by OR ligands in animal system. Therefore, the future task will be to identify at a holistic level the extent to which OR is involved in overall physiological phenomena in vivo. More in-depth and comprehensive studies on an OR production and delivery system from the viewpoint of chemosensory machinery are needed for the research of animal physiology and the application of OR-related mechanisms. Another additional point to consider is that the OR family is one of the most dynamic gene populations among individuals [77]. In order to discover new facts about the function of ORs, environmental issues, as well as internal factors, must be considered. The report that bats have a unique and diverse OR gene repertoire deserves consideration [78].
To advance the study of the various functions and roles of ORs, the modularity mechanism that acts between the receptor and its wide-ranged ligands should be addressed.
