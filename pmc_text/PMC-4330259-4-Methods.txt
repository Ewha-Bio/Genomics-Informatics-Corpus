Genotyping assays
Samples from the Seoul City cohort were genotyped on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) at DNALink. For the data obtained from this chip, internal quality control (QC) measures were used: the QC call rate (Dynamic Model algorithm) always exceeded 86%. Genotype calling was carried out using the Birdseed (v2) algorithm. A total of 1,004 individuals were genotyped using this platform. Ten of the 1,004 individuals were removed due to low genotyping call rates (<95%). Three individuals were excluded due to failed genotyping of rs2725220, leaving a total of 991 individuals for the study.
