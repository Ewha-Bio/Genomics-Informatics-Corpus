Validation of a CNV region on chr20: 42739446–42741539
We selected one CNV region located on chromosome 20q13.12—chr20: 42739446–42741539—or validation based on position and expected biological function. The allele frequencies of chr20: 42739446–42741539 are indicated in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2. First, we conducted in silico verification for the existence of the CNV region using web-based public data. Many previously reported CNVs, including the chr20: 42739446–42741539 region, were identified using the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.uscs.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) (Supplementary Fig. 3). Also, frequencies of reported CNVs evaluated in various ethnic groups were presented in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV, http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home) (Supplementary Table 1).
To experimentally verify the accuracy of the CNV, we performed quantitative PCR. The position of the CNV probe was defined based on hg19/NCBI build 37. The probe ID used for the TaqMan genotyping assay of the validated CNVs is listed in Table 3. Applications of a positive predictive value as a measurement standard of accuracy indicated the proportion of positive results in the validation of the CNV region. The positive predictive value of the verified CNV region evaluated in our validation was 0.82. Fig. 1 shows the genotype of the identified CNV region, verified by quantitative PCR.
