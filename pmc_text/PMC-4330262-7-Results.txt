Gene expression
We first performed unsupervised cluster analysis comparing COX-2-overexpressing cell lines and control cell lines. Among 24,371 probe sets, we selected and analyzed 567 probe sets with a standard deviation > 0.5. The group of U2OS-COX-2 (U2OS-COX-2 #1, #2, and #3) and the group of U2OS-pcDNA3 (U2OS-pcDNA3 #1, #2, and #3) were well segregated in the unsupervised cluster analysis, confirming that our experiment was validated (Fig. 1).
To identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in COX-2-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells, we first performed the Wilcoxon rank sum test between the group of U2OS-COX-2 and the group of U2OS-pcDNA3. The 2,144 probe sets passed the criteria. Then, to identify DEGs, we selected 76 probe sets with an average fold-change > 1.5.
Among the DEGs, 56 genes were upregulated while 20 genes were downregulated in the group of U2OS-COX-2 as compared to the group of U2OS-pcDNA3 (Tables 2 and 3). The heat map of DEGs is provided in Fig. 2. The gene encoding COX-2, PTGS2, was upregulated by 10.41-fold in the COX-2-overexpressing cell lines as compared to the control cell lines, confirming again that our experiment is validated (Table 2).
