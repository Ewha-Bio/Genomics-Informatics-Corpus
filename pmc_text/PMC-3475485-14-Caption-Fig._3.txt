Expression verification of candidate genes at the mRNA level. (A) Microarray data for selective genes including PPARγ, PKCα, Wnt4, ITGα4, IL6ST, AQP1, and TGF-β2. (B, C) Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of gene expression for selective genes in Pkd2 KO and PKD2 TG MEF cells. β-actin primer was used as the internal control. The experiment was performed in triplicate. PPAR-γ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; PKCα, protein kinase α; ITGα4, integrin α4; AQP1, aquaporin 1; TGF-β2, transforming growth factor-β2; KO, knockout; TG, transgenic; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; KOWT, knockout wild-type (MEF); TGWT, transgenic wild-type (MEF).
