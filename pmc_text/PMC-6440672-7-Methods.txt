Gene selection
Although the pre-screening process greatly reduced the number of genes, there remained the problem of an ill-posed model, since the sample size was very small compared to the number of features. Therefore, sequential variable selection using a multiple Cox regression model was not applicable. To solve such a problem, as presented below, multiple Cox regression using penalized partial likelihood was used for variable selection and shrinkage estimation.
β ^ = argmin β 1 n [ Σ s = 1 S - X i s t + log { Σ i ∈ R s exp ( X i s t β ) } ] + P α , λ ( β ) ,
where Pα,λ(β)=Σc=1Cλ(δ∣βc∣+0.5(1-δ)βc2)+Σg=1Gλ(δ∣βg∣+0.5(1-δ)βg2) is the penalty function. Note that C and G are the indicator sets of clinical and genetic variables, respectively.
Modified partial likelihood was also used to select clinical variables more favorably, since some clinical variables have already been reported to be significant.
P γ , α , λ ( β ) = Σ c = 1 C λ γ ( δ ∣ β c ∣ + 0.5 ( 1 - δ ) β c 2 ) + Σ g = 1 ∣ G ˜ ∣ λ ( δ ∣ β g ∣ + 0.5 ( 1 - δ ) β g 2 )
Thus, the penalty factor γ is used to reduce the penalty of clinical variables.
The partial likelihood estimation process explained above is implemented in the R package “glmnet,” also known as “coxnet” [15].
