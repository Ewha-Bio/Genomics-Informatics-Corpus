Workflow of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data analysis using Bioconductor packages. Four packages are used in this workflow. The ‘dada2’ package performs the trimming of high-throughput sequencing file. The ‘QuasR’ package performs alignment and quality check. The ‘mosaic’ package, which is the core of this workflow, performs the peak calling step. The last package, ‘ChIPseeker,’ performs annotation, visualization, and functional enrichment analysis.
