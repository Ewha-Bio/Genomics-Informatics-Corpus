Screening of miRNAs and genes
Extensive literature search and exploration of online databases were conducted to understand miRNAs mediated regulation of solid cancer associated target genes using miRCancer (http://mircancer.ecu.edu/) and miRDisease (http://mir2disease.org). miRNAs and target genes were screened by following two criteria: (1) only up regulated oncogenes or down regulated tumor suppressor genes were selected and (2) the screening was performed by selecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as target genes when both of them are either up regulated or down regulated. Further, minimum free energy (MFE) score based binding affinity between miRNAs and their target genes were explored and inspected using miRTarbase web server (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/). Furthermore, the involvement of target genes in different biological function was inspected using UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) web server and plotted using Venn (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/) diagram.
