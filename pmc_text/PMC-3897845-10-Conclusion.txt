Genomic technologies hold the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of inherited and complex diseases-including cancer- and facilitate the move towards personalized predictive medicine. The higher throughput and rapidly falling costs of next-generation sequencing have resulted in voluminous genomic data and downstream computational challenges. Thus, the shift from this powerful discovery research to clinical implementation can only be accomplished with careful integration with EMRs, a frontline patient care tool. The most prominent reason to integrate clinical information and biology information under the same system is to provide opportunities for bi-directional exchange of data, technology, and knowledge between two disciplines with different histories and cultures. Additionally, open global cooperation will provide opportunities to make rapid progress in understanding, treating, and preventing human diseases.
