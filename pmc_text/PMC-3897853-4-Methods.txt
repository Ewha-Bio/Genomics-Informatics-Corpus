Acridine orange staining
Acidic vesicular organelles were quantified by vital staining with Acridine Orange (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both the cytoplasm and nucleolus fluoresced bright green and dim red, whereas acidic compartments fluoresced bright red. The intensity of red fluorescence is proportional to the degree of acidity and/or the volume of the cellular acidic compartment [22]. Cells were stained with acridine orange and analyzed by flow cytometry and Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
