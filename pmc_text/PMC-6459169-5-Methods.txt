Data deposition
Raw RNA-seq data were deposited into the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (accession numbers, SRR7874621 for P. antarcticus and SRR7874380 for P. papua) under the bioproject numbers, PRJNA491756 for P. antarcticus and PRJNA491755 for P. papua, respectively. The Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly project was deposited into the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank database under accession numbers, GGXL00000000 for P. antarcticus and GGXK00000000 for P. papua.
