(A) Heatmap of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) binding to transcription start site (TSS) regions. It shows the profile of ChIP peaks binding to TSS regions, which are defined as the flanking sequence of TSSs. (B) Average profile of ChIP peaks binding to TSS regions. The average profile of the ChIP peaks is a graph showing the read count frequency in the range from â€“3000 bp to +3000 bp. Since the H3K4me3 state is a promoter marker, the read count frequency is high in the TSS region.
