Situations in which IVW and SZ can give distinct results
In this section, we demonstrate a situation in which IVW and SZ can give distinct results. As we have shown above, SZ whose weights are given as SE(Xi)−1(SZ_SE) is analytically equivalent to IVW. However, SZ whose weights are given as the square root of sample size (SZ_N) can give slightly different results, if the expected relationship SEXi−1∝N is broken. We have already shown that a MAF difference can result in such breakage of this relationship. Here, additionally, we show that the use of a linear mixed model can also result in such breakage of the relationship SEXi−1∝N. We used the data of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [28]. This dataset includes approximately 2,000 cases for each of seven different diseases and 1,500 controls for each of two control groups (1958C and National Bureau of Standards [NBS]). We used the data on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). After standard quality-control and removal of the MHC region, we obtained 469,225 SNPs. We performed association tests for two diseases; we performed association tests for RA using NBS as controls and association tests for T1D using 1958C as controls. The sample sizes for the two association tests were similar (N = 3,318 and 3,443, respectively). We used logistic regression implemented in plink (with--logistic command). Because the sample sizes of the two tests were similar, we expected that for each SNP, the standard errors of the effect size estimate would be similar. That is, we wanted to test if the relationship SEXi−1∝N held well for these real data. Fig. 2A shows that when we plotted the log10 value of the ratio of the two standard errors, the values were highly concentrated around 0. This implies that the standard errors were very similar between RA and T1D, as expected, because the sample sizes were similar. Thus, the relationship SEXi−1∝N approximately held well. Therefore, Fig. 2A shows that IVW and SZ_N have similar results in this situation.
Next, we changed the study design and used the linear mixed model implemented in the software package Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association (GEMMA). We used GEMMA for both T1D and RA. Fig. 2B shows that the standard errors of these two analyses were similar. Then, we used GEMMA for T1D but not for RA. When we plotted the log10 value of the ratio of the resulting standard errors, the values deviated dramatically from 0 (Fig. 2C). The standard errors were much smaller in the linear mixed model than in the logistic regression. This is expected, because the effect sizes of the linear mixed model and logistic model have different meanings and are not comparable. Therefore, the relationship SEXi−1∝N does not hold. As a result, in the meta-analysis, the p-values of IVW and SZ_N differed dramatically. Note that the standard errors given by GEMMA can be slightly different from the standard linear model, because GEMMA regresses the effect of population structure. However, an additional analysis comparing the standard errors of GEMMA and the standard linear model demonstrated that this effect is minimal and that their standard errors were similar (Fig. 3). Thus, the difference observed between GEMMA and the logistic regression model was mainly due to the use of different models (linear and logistic).
One may argue that a meta-analysis design that combines the results of a logistic regression model and linear model is uncommon. Indeed, for binary traits, the use of a logistic regression model is more suitable. However, for dealing with population structure and cryptic relatedness, a linear mixed model is currently the main tool. For GWASs, there is no widely used efficient package implementing a logistic mixed model. For this reason, many studies are using a linear mixed model for binary traits as approximations. Therefore, if we assume a situation that the effect size in one study is obtained from a logistic regression model and the effect size in another study is obtained from a linear mixed model, the results of IVW and SZ_N can be different.
