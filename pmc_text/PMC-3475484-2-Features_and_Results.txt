System requisites
Java Runtime Environment of Sun Microsystems 1.6.0 (Oracle, Redwood City, CA, USA) or equivalent is required, since the system is written in Java language. We used MySQL database for storing and retrieving CNV data and GBrowse2 [12] for drawing regional information. Both are freely available from their distribution websites.
Since the main search pages are written in Java Server Page (JSP) language, Apache Tomcat is needed for the application server and Apache HTTP server is needed for Gbrowse2 viewer pages (Fig. 1).
