We have shown that both miR-146a and miR-155 were up-regulated in response to the adaptive immune response in PBMC derived from SjS when testing humans and mice [19]. In this study, miR-146a expression in SjS patients as well as in the SjS-prone C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mouse model was investigated to elucidate its involvement in SjS pathogenesis. Expression of miR-146a was significantly increased in SjS patients (n = 25) compared with HC (n = 10), and was upregulated in the salivary glands of the SjS-prone mouse at both 8 weeks (prior to disease onset) and 20 weeks (full-blown disease) of age, and in the PBMC at 20 weeks of age. More importantly, functional analysis revealed the roles for miR-146a in increasing phagocytic activity and suppressing inflammatory cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], interleukin [IL]-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1α, and IL-6), whereas cell migration, nitric oxide production, and expression of antigen-presenting/costimulatory molecules were not affected in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Our data suggest that abnormal expression/regulation of miRNAs in innate immunity may contribute to, or be indicative of, the initiation and early stage of SjS [19].
MiR-146a is known to be activated by nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which controls Toll-like receptor (TLR)/IL-1 receptor signaling pathway through TNF-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK1), the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1(STAT1), and IRF5 [31]. It is important to mention that the expression, the roles, and the target gene regulation of miRNA146a/b need to be interpreted in the context of a specific disease entity as its regulatory mechanisms appear to be more complex than initially anticipated. For instance, in the PBMC of RA patients, the overexpression of miR-146a was found without any change in its target genes [31]. However, in SLE, the expression of miR-146a was decreased with increased IRAK1 expression and unchanged TRAF6 [32]. In a study by Zilahi et al. [33], the authors have found elevated miR-146a/b in the PBMC of SjS with down-regulated IRAK1 and upregulated TRAF6, detected by RT-PCR. Because of these findings, Jacob et al. [34] hypothesized that TRAF6 could be specific for SjS while IRAK1 could be regarded as a risk gene for SLE. They previously reported a multiple defect (decrease) in the expression of various protein kinase C isoenzymes (included PKC) in the monocytes and T cells of SLE patients, but not existing in SjS [10]. Therefore, the authors proposed that TRAF6 contributes to the activation of the NF-κB pathway by the involvement of PKC, which exists normally in the disease, and TRAF6 gene could be a new biomarker of SjS [33].
Another study discovered changes in miRNA expression profiles in the PBMC of patients with SLE (n = 8), pSjS (n = 8), and HC (n = 7) by the Illumina NGS technology [10], which was mentioned earlier for SLE in this review. This study by Chen et al. [10] is interesting in the sense that miR-146a was overexpressed in SLE patient PBMC, which is inconsistent with the finding by Tang et al. [32] that showed downregulated miR-146a in the SLE PBMC. Chen et al. [10] hypothesized that this inconsistency may be due to a difference in the ethnic backgrounds of participants in the two studies; Chen et al.’s study [10] involved Europeans and Tang et al.’s study [32] involved Chinese. The authors also indicated various external factors as a potential reason for the discrepancy, such as dietary habits, exposure to different infectious agents, and other environmental elements, which may have influenced miRNAs expression level in the PBMC of the patients [35, 36].
In a recent study by Peng et al. [24], several miRNAs with a viral origin including miR-181a were shown to be upregulated in PBMC of patients with SjS. MicroRNA profiling by microarrays in Chinese patients with pSjS revealed elevated miRNA 181a in the PBMC [24]. MiRNA expression was initially profiled in female patients (4 pSjS and 3 HC), followed by a large cohort of patients (n = 33) and HC (n = 10). Among the 202 miRNAs that were upregulated and 180 miRNAs that were downregulated in the patients with pSjS, the authors confirmed that miR-181a was the most profoundly differentially expressed in pSjS in comparison with HC. The authors speculate that elevated miR-181a levels in the PBMC of these patients compromise the maturation of B cells, thus enabling them to recognize and attack autoantigens and resulting in disease phenotypes [24]. Interestingly, many virus-derived miRNA were unexpectedly upregulated in the SjS patients, suggesting that viral infection of PBMC may play an important role in SjS.
Although the sources and compositions of the cells were different, the detection of viral miRNAs in PBMC by Peng et al. [24] was in line with the study investigating the salivary glands by Gallo et al. [22]. The former showing the presence of EBV miRNAs and the upregulation of miRNA-181a in B cells, where EBV establishes cell tropism, provides a convincing scenario that viral miRNAs may drive the expression of host miRNAs in a cell-specific manner. The latter study, mentioned earlier, demonstrated that ebv-miR-BART13-3p was present in both B cells and salivary epithelial cells in pSjS salivary glands. The authors further demonstrated the transfer of ebv-miR-BART13-3p from B cells to salivary epithelial cells through exosomes, suggesting a possibility of its role in compromising calcium signaling by targeting STIM1 and consequent secretory dysfunction. The establishment of the interplay between viral miRNA and host miRNA will provide the exact etiological and pathological link between viral infection and SjS.
