Genotype imputation
Of the 13 SNPs that were reported by the MAGIC consortium, 4 SNPs were genotyped in the original KARE genotype data using the Affy 5.0. To maximize the validation SNPs in Koreans, the Chinese-Japanese HapMap dataset was imputed to obtain 6 additional SNPs. Thus, 10 SNPs were analyzed in this study. The detailed imputation procedure has been published. Briefly, the KARE dataset, comprising 351,677 SNPs in 8,842 individuals, was merged with that of the international HapMap Phase II Japanese (JPT) + Chinese (HCB) panel 2 [9]. The genotypes of the KARE individuals were imputed using IMPUTE [10]. Using the following filtering scheme-INFO ≥ 0.5 and posterior probability ≥ 0.9-1,827,004 SNPs were imputed, and 6 SNPs that matched among the 13 SNPs that were reported by MAGIC were selected for study.
