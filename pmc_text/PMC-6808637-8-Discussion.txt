GWAS and expression quantitative trait loci
We used the GWAS and RNA-seq data associated with body fat. The expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are genomic loci that explain a variation in expression levels of mRNAs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_quantitative_trait_loci). Parks et al. [19] showed the genetic control of obesity and gut microbiota composition using eQTL analysis. In our analysis, the accurate beta effect estimation accompanied by p-value are crucial and thus eQTL analysis can help better estimating TC because eQTL information contains the mRNA expression level.
