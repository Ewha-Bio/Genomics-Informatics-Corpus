MD simulation
MD simulation was carried out for the predicted models to understand the stability and conformational changes of the modeled proteins in holo and apo forms. The simulation was carried out in a water (SPC-molecule)-solvated system with optimal physiological conditions, wherein the temperature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 1 atm for both the ER and KR domains. The computed total energy and potential energy remained stable from start of the dynamics simulation until the course of the the 5-ns simulation in the case of both proteins. The ER domain had a total energy of -82,181.468 kJ/mol and a potential energy of -101,788.978 kJ/mol. Similarly, KR also had stable distribution with a total energy of -141,285.655 kJ/mol and potential energy of -174,168.487 kJ/mol. The event trajectory was observed to remain stable throughout the simulation process. Further, the stability of the modeled proteins was verified by plotting the root mean square deviation (RMSD) graph for backbone atoms during the production run. The RMSD for the ER domain remained stable for the 5-ns time frame with minimal deviation until the end of 5 ns (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the RMSD plot for the KR model also suggested a stable trajectory during the production run (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the radius of gyration was also calculated for each model during the simulation process and was found to be within the range of 1 Ã…, indicating the compactness of the models predicted (Figs. 5B and 6B). Hence, these validation studies summarize the higher plausibility of the predicted models.
