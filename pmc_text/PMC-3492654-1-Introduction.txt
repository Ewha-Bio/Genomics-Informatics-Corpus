According to the Korea Central Cancer Registry data, gastric cancer is ranked as the most common cancer in Korean and men and accounted for about 20.1% of all cancers in Koreans. In Korea, 29,727 cases of gastric cancer were newly diagnosed, and the crude incidence rate of gastric cancer in 2009 was 59.9 per 100,000. In males, the number of newly diagnosed cases and incidence rates of stomach cancer in 2009 were 19,953 cases and 80.2 per 100,000, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rates of gastric cancers were increased by 22.5% from 42.8% in 1993-1995 to 65.3% in 2005-2009 [1].
Evidence from pathology and epidemiology studies has provided a human model of gastric carcinogenesis with the following sequential stages: chronic gastritis; atrophic gastritis; intestinal metaplasia; and dysplasia [2]. Also, an environmental element of gastric cancer occurrence exists plentifully. The best well-known risk factors for gastric cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection, by far the strongest established risk factor for gastric cancer; a family history; and smoking. Several factors related to nutrition and food preservation, such as high intake of salt-preserved foods and dietary nitrite or low intake of fruit and vegetables, are likely to increase the risk of gastric cancer [3].
Cancerogenesis, which is the loss of cellular differentiation that leads the digestive tract to cancer, is inhibited by nutrition factors, such as retinoid, vitamins B-complex (including folate), vitamin C, D3, and E, polyphenol, fiber, calcium, selenium, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., Omega-3) [4]. Especially, the environmental factors in cancer and a high intake of vitamin B-complex play important roles in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation [5]. There have been many epidemiological studies that gastric cancer is associated with high-risk dietary profiles (low folate, vitamin B6 intake, and high alcohol), smoking, and low blood folate concentration [6-8].
Folate is the water-soluble form of vitamin B9 in foods [9]. Leafy vegetables, such as spinach, turnip greens, lettuces, dried beans, peas, fortified cereal products, sunflower seeds, and certain fruits, are rich sources of folate. The recommended dietary allowance for adults is 400 µg of food folate a day, which is equivalent to about 240 µg synthetic folic acid in supplements or fortified food. Women of child-bearing age planning a pregnancy should take 400 µg synthetic folic acid daily in addition to their normal dietary intake [10, 11]. There is now substantial data to support an important role for folate in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), Down syndrome, vascular disease, various cancers, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive function, and affective disorders [12]. Cumulative evidences suggest that food containing folate decreases the risk of colorectal, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers [13]. Also, a western lifestyle, which is associated with high total caloric or fat intake (include red meat), and inactive life pattern, has been considered one of the main reasons for increasing trends of cancer in Koreans [14].
Variations in levels of serum total homocysteine (tHcy) can result from genetic or nutrient-related disturbances in the folate pathway. In this mechanism, fasting levels of tHcy mainly reflect the remethylation pathway. In the remethylation pathway, the primary methyl donor for the vitamin B12-dependent conversion of Hcy to methionine is 5-methlytetrahydrofolate, which in turn forms 5, 10-methlytetrahydrofolate by means of the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).
Recent reports suggested that individual genetic variation or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in various genes involved in cellular folate metabolism or transport may also be implicated in cancer risk. In the folate metabolism pathway, cellular folate act as donors and receptors of methyl groups in the biosynthesis of nucleotide precursors used for DNA synthesis and provide methyl groups for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins [15]. MTHFR, methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase (MTRR), and methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR) genes are well known for their association with the folate pathway [16,17].
MTHFR maps to chromosome 1p36.3 and is 2.2-kb long and contains 11 exons. The gene product is a 77-kD protein, although a smaller isoform of approximately 70 kD has been observed in some tissues, such as liver [18]. SNPs in MTHFR, such as C677T (rs1801133), A1298C (rs1801131), and G1793A (rs2274976), have been suggested to be associated with several cancers (colon, gastric, and breast), cardiovascular disease, NTDs, and pregnancy complications [6, 9, 19-21]. In cancer patients, higher sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) among patients carrying the MTHFR 677TT and 1298AA genotypes compared to the others was reported, demonstrating a strong predictive ability of these polymorphisms in response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in gastric cancer [22, 23].
The MTRR gene was mapped to human chromosome 5p15.3-p15.2, is 34 kb long, comprises 15 exons, has 22 codon SNP (cSNP) variation sites, and is thought to produce cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNA isoforms [24, 25]. Polymorphisms in MTRR-rs1801394 (A66G), rs1532268 (S175L), and rs10380 (H595Y)-have been associated with the risk of cancers (breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia), Down syndrome, and Alzheimer disease [26-31]. The MTR gene maps to human chromosome 1q42, is 105 kb, comprises 33 exons, and has 116 SNP variation sites. One polymorphism in MTR (rs1805087) has been associated with colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk [8, 32].
For gastric cancer, a genetic variation in MTHFR has been recently reported [33, 34]. Also, case-control studies with specific results on folate intake (or blood concentration) and gastric cancer risk suggest a protective role in a couple of reports [35, 36]. The MTR or MTRR gene variations were associated with colorectal and pancreatic cancer risk [8, 37], but there has been no report on gastric cancer. In this study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms in MTHFR, MTRR, and MTR and the risk of gastric cancer in Koreans.
