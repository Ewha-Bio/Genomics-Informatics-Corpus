Metritis is an acute inflammatory disease in the uterus of dairy cows, found in ~20% of lactating dairy cows, with the incidence ranging from 8% to more than 40% in some farms [1–3]. Metritis gives rise to a reduction in reproductive performance and milk production and an increase in culling and antibiotic use [4–6], which costs about $358 per case of metritis [7]. Given the U.S. dairy cow population of 9.3 million [8] and the typical incidence in U.S. herds of 20%, the total cost of metritis to the US dairy industry is estimated at approximately $665 million.
Uterine infection is a common phenomenon after parturition and thus uterine discharge is normal physiology for postpartum cows to eliminate bacteria residing in the uterus. However, when cows fail to naturally eradicate bacteria, there is a greater pathogen burden that causes them to suffer from inflammation with enlarged uterus and fetid red-brownish uterine discharge [5, 9]. A fever > 39.5°C can accompany these symptoms, but not all of metritic cows show a fever [10, 11].
Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Prevotella melaninogenica are thought to be primary pathogens causing uterine disease, because these bacteria were frequently isolated from the uterine lumen of diseased cows, and they were shown to affect endometrium and ovary function [12–17]. In particular, E. coli emerged in the uterus within a few days of calving, followed by the colonization of T. pyogenes and F. necrophorum, suggesting that the uterine pathogens work synergistically. However, it should be noted that these bacteria were mostly isolated in cows with endometritis, which is different from metritis in terms of time and location of infection. Previous studies based on a culture method also have a limitation of detecting fastidious anaerobic microorganisms that require specific nutrients for growth on media. Indeed, it has been suggested that about less than 1% of environmental microorganisms are cultivable in the laboratory [18].
To overcome limitations in culture methods, recent studies have used metagenomic sequencing which is a powerful tool to identify bacterial community. For example, clone library sequencing and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed uterine bacterial community of dairy cows that was different between cows with and without metritis [19–22]. The Illumina platform allowed deeper sequencing than previously possible, with the potential to detect very rare phylotypes, which makes it possible to define uterine microbiota associated with metritis [10, 23–26]. Herein, the aim of the current paper is to review some recent studies that used metagenomic approaches to explore uterine bacterial community involved in metritis and discuss uterine bacteria that are known and newly identified in metagenomic sequencing.
