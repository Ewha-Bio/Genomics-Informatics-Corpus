Epidemiological studies
Using the traits in Table 2, we performed a logistic regression test. Table 5 summarizes the results. As we can see, diabetes, gastritis, allergy, external head injury, taking arthritis drug, and degree of albumin were highly correlated with hepatitis. In the case of diabetes, the probability that a diabetes patient had hepatitis was 4 times higher than a diabetes-free person. In general, the hepatitis C virus is often associated with diabetes, and some diabetics may even develop chronic hepatitis [7]. Gastritis is influenced by hepatitis. If we have hepatitis, the probability of getting gastritis is increased 1.5 times. Especially, chronic gastritis develops by chronic hepatitis [8]. Sometimes, allergy cahepatitis. It increases the probability of hepatitis by 1.8 times. Hepatitis virus can cause arthritis [9]; it increases the probability of arthritis by 1.9 times. The degree of albumin is inversely proportional to hepatitis (odds ratio [OR], 0.8), because the liver makes albumin, and hepatitis enervates the process. The OR between external head injury and hepatitis is very high (OR, 1.31). We cannot explain the medical relationship between them. It needs more analysis.
Table 6 shows AUC values from the variables in Table 5. As we can see, four variables can explain 64.7% of the cause of hepatitis, and 8 variables can explain 69.3%. Fig. 2 shows the ROC plot for eight variables in Table 3.
