GWAS of BF
A GWAS using BF of Landrace and Yorkshire pigs was performed. The PLINK program was used for the GWAS [6]. The covariates were sex, parity and breed. The model used for the Landrace and Yorkshire pigs was the following:
y i = μ + sex + parity + breeds + β * g i + e i ,
where yi is the backfat thickness of the i-th individual, μ is the mean of backfat thickness in the population, sex, parity and breeds are the covariate, β is the beta effect in GWAS, gi represents the SNP genotypes and ei is the error in the model.
