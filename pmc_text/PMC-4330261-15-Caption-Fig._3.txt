Transcriptional activity of the wild-type and mutant HNF-1β. The WT and mutant (H153N, P159L) HNF1B expression plasmids (0.02 µg) were transfected into COS-7 cells with 0.2 µg of pGL3-hGLUT2 promoter. β-Galactosidase activity was used for normalization of transfection efficiency. (A) HNF-1β proteins expressed by Western blot. (B) Human GLUT2 promoter regions inserted into the luciferase vector. (C) The relative luciferase activity was measured. Fold-induction refers to the activity with vehicle. Result is represented as means ± SE of five independent experiments. veh, vehicle; WT, wild-type; HNF-1β, hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β; GLUT2, glucose transporter type 2. *p < 0.05.
