We analyzed PHE genes in crenarchaeal genomes with respect to MRCBS. We calculated the expression pattern and codon usage in Aeropyrumpernix K1, Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7. Threshold scores used to classify highly expressed genes in our approach in Aeropyrumpernix K1, Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 were turned out to be 0.75, 0.68, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.83, respectively. GC content of Aeropyrumpernix K1, Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 are 56.31%, 53.74%, 51.36%, 35.79%, and 32.79%, respectively. This variation of GC content may be regarded as the main reason of codon usage variances between different species of Crenarchaeota. Table 1 displays the statistics of PHE genes, GC content and the maximum value of MRCBS for each of the crenarchaeal genomes used in the study. It was observed that percentage of PHE genes in Escherichia coli was 9% to 10% [915] and percentage of PHE genes in Synechocystis was about 10% [11], whereas the percentage of PHE genes in crenarchaeal genomes varied from 11.53% to 33.38% and were independent of GC content or optimal growth temperature of these unicellular organisms. It indicates that the percentage of PHE genes in Crenarchaeota is higher than in bacteria. The correlation between growth temperature and genomic GC content has not established by most of the studies [3334] and in general, the variation in GC content is mostly elucidated by subtle but persistent mutation biases [3536].It is familiar that highly expressed genes show stronger codon usage bias than the genes expressed at lower levels. In agreement with previous other reports [91011], we observed that PHE genes of crenarchaeal species included RP genes, translational/transcription genes, chaperon or degradation genes and many stress and energy metabolism genes. However, all RP genes of crenarchaeal genomes do not incorporate the PHE gene class. The percentage of RP genes in crenarchaeal genomes varies from 47% to 87.88% whereas almost all RP genes in E. coli and yeast fall in PHE class of genes [1920]. It is remarkable that 99.21% RP genes in yeast genome were PHE [20]. However, an average of 65.56% RP genes in crenarchaeal genomes were found to be PHE, indicating that many RP genes of crenarchaeal genomes were of reduced predicted expression level in contrast to E. coli and yeast. Crenarchaeota generally live in extreme environmental conditions that are likely to affect the expression level of the respective gene responsible for its habitat, energy sources and lifestyle. The highest predicted expression levels of top 10 genes for five crenarchaeal genomes are shown in Table 2. It is worth noticing that these genes are separated into different functional categories. Annotation of these PHE genes was done by Secondary (JCVI) Annotation (http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/GenomePage.cgi).As it can be seen from the Table 2, the PHE genes are variably represented among crenarchaeal genomes. We observed that genes belonging to the class of translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis were generally highly expressed. In the top 10 highly expressed genes among five crenarchaeal genomes, 28 RP genes (56%) were found to be highly expressed (shown in Table 2). The RNA polymerase subunits RpoA1, RpoA2, RpoB, RpoE1, RpoE2, RpoH, RpoK, RpoL, and RPoN as with bacterial genomes were found to be predominantly PHE in many crenarchaeal genomes. Several noticeable genes, e.g., Ths, PCNA, P0, Cdc48, and Pfd which are absent from bacterial genomes, but exist in eukaryotes, were found to be highly expressed in many crenarchaeal genomes. A number of genes which include ribonucleotide reductase, the DNA polymerase sliding clamp and members of the FAD synthetase family, exhibit cell cycle-dependent expression in crenarchaeal genomes. It should be noticed that these genes are usually existed by multiple copies in the genome. Among other PHE genes, Rieske iron-sulfur protein and ferredoxin have important functions in these organisms. Besides, we identified a number of PHE genes which play important role in signal transduction mechanism, amino acid transport and metabolism, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and catabolism, cell wall/membrane/envelop biogenesis, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, coenzyme transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, intercellular trafficking, and energy production and conversion.However, a portion of genes categorized as hypothetical genes may be obtained among the PHE genes in most crenarchaeal genomes. Table 2 displays the general statistics of hypothetical or poorly characterized PHE genes found in several crenarchaeal genomes. Goodacre et al. [37] showed that 238 out of 355 essential proteins in 16 model bacterial species comprised proteins in domains of unknown function (DUFs), and most of them characterized single-domain proteins which clearly established the biological importance of DUFs. It suggests that experimental research should emphasis on conserved and essential DUFs for functional analysis. So, PHE hypothetical genes may be interesting candidates for experimental categorizations to find additional key features of the crenarchaeal cell cycle. The temporal and spatial grouping of these genes for chromosome replication, genome segregation, and cell division processes are little categorized in Crenarchaeota than in bacteria and eukaryotes. A comprehensive study of these putative/hypothetical PHE genes should produce a more comprehensive image of the replication and division machineries, and regulatory features of the cell cycle.
