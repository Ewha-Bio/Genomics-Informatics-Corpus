RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted from cells with Trizol (Life Technologies), purified with the addition of chloroform, and precipitated with the addition of isopropanol. The RNA concentration was determined by a spectrophotometer, and the quality of RNA was evaluated by the OD 260/280 ratio and gel electrophoresis.
