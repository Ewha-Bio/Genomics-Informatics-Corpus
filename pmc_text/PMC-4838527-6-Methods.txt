RNA secondary structure prediction
The precursor RNA molecule of msDNA forms a characteristic secondary structure. We used a local installation of the software tool CentroidFold [8] to predict the secondary structure of the msr/msd portion of the candidate retron. As the palindrome terminates with a G residue in both strands, the 5' of which is the branching point for covalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B), sequences without these G residues were removed. The web service version of RNAfold [9] was also used to visually confirm the final prediction set.
