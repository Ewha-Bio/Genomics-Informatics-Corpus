Since large-scale epigenetic datasets such as Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) or Roadmap Genomics became publicly available [1, 2], there has been a growing interest in predicting the function of non-coding DNA regions directly from their sequences [3–6]. The details of the dynamics of chromatin state conversions among different cell types reported that extensive signal variation exists in regulatory regions [7]. And recent studies based on ChromHMM datasets [8, 9] provided novel insights into n-gram probabilistic language models for non-coding DNA regions stratified by chromatin variability.
As a follow-up to our preliminary study on ChromHMM datasets of ENCODE [10], we extend our discoveries and continue ongoing efforts to build comparative nucleotide frequency profiles stratified by the chromatin variability. We hope to detect Markov properties by analyzing datasets of the full range of 127 cell and tissue types provided by Roadmap Genomics.
We investigated whether some subsets of the annotated Roadmap Genomics 15-state model stratified by chromatin variability can be predicted by purely making n-gram models of DNA sequences. To do that, ChromHMM blocks of human genome were first dissected into nucleosome resolution of 200-bp units, which accounted for 1,965,764,166 units (127 × 15,478,458 of 200-bp units), and they were integrated into one BED file. Then each individual unit was assigned one dominant chromatin state, by analyzing the integrated BED file of ChromHMM. Next based on chromatin variability of each 200-bp unit—referred to as occurrence frequency—the number of different chromatin states in ChromHMM annotations we divided the units into two groups for each chromatin state: highly variable units and invariable units. By using highly variable 200-bp units as our control group, we were able to isolate some invariable chromatin units that showed strong Markov properties.
