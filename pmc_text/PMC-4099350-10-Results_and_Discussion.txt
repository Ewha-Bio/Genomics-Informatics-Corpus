Conclusion
Different natural products have been identified and used as promising drug sources against cancer caused by HPV. Advancement in bioinformatics and computational biology are proficient invalidating those natural drugs through in silico approaches. E6 proteins of high-risk HPV 16 inactivate p53 by inducing its degradation, a process that requires a ternary complex between E6, E6AP, and p53. Low-risk HPVs, such as HPV-6 and HPV-11, do not have the ability to degrade p53. Thus, E6 of HPV-16 is of considerable interest for designing novel inhibitors to overcome the challenges of cervical cancer. A high-quality 3D model of E6 obtained through a computational approach and docking analysis employing AutoDock 4.2 in this study provided high-throughput validation. This in silico approach may be of interest in designing new drugs from natural sources against cervical cancer.
