Study overview. (A) Whole exome deep sequencing of whole blood DNA samples from ten breast cancer patients at ~200× depth using the Illumina GAII(x). (B) Generation of ten datasets from 20× to 200× depths. Each dataset was selected independent of the others. (C) Read mapping and variant calling with quality control. Variations such as indels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were annotated with related functional and regional information. (D) Various analyses of identified variants, such as number of variants, read depth, and genomic coverage according to the mapped depths using both the whole genome and diagnostic genes.
