Survival analysis: SFRP methylation in association with clinical factors
It is well known that the survival rate of colorectal cancer is negatively correlated with the tumor stage: the higher the stage, the poorer the survival. We confirmed this trend in the expanded dataset (n = 419). Stages IIA and IIB were merged into stage II, and similarly, stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC were merged into stage III. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed, as expected, lower survival for higher stages (Fig. 9). The Cox regression analyses also indicated a significant association of stage IV with survival rate (mean hazard ratio 6.083) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.778 to 20.812; p = 0.004) (Table 4).
Upon confirming the anticipated survival trends by stage in the expanded dataset, we tested whether the methylation level of SFRP1 correlated with the survival rate. Among the four methylation probes, cg15839448 was chosen, as its methylation level showed the most consistent correlation with the expression level of SFRP1. In order to separate the samples into two groups that showed a survival difference according to SFRP1 methylation beta-values, we used maximally selected rank statistics, implemented in R (the maxstat package), yielding the cutoff point (beta-value = 0.598) (Fig. 10A). Similarly, cg23207990 was chosen for SFRP2, yielding the cutoff point (beta-value = 0.713) (Fig. 10B).
The group with highly methylated SFRP1 showed poorer survival than the other group (p = 0.0181) (Fig. 11A). On the other hand, SFRP2 methylation did not exhibit a significant relationship (p = 0.107) (Fig. 11B). The corresponding hazard ratios from the Cox regression analysis were 1.93 (95% CI, 1.119 to 3.329) and 1.703 (95% CI, 0.892 to 3.25) for SFRP1 and SFRP2, respectively (Table 4). As higher tumor stage shows a higher risk rate in the cumulative hazard curve (Fig. 12A), higher SFRP1 methylation also increases the risk rate (Fig. 12B).
In conclusion, hypermethylation of SFRP genes has been linked to the downregulation of their expression in colorectal cancers [11]. Here, we confirm it using independent TCGA datasets. The evidence was stronger for SFRP1 but only marginal for SFRP2. We also demonstrate that promoter hypermethylation of SFRP1 is linked to poor survival of colorectal cancer patients.
