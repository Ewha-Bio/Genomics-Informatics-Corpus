Construction overview of fission yeast gene deletion strains. (A) Structure of the deletion cassette consisting of the KanMX module and its flanking RHG (Region of Homology to the Gene of interest). The KanMX4 module is flanked by unique barcodes and RHG on both sides. The deletion cassette replaces the open reading frame of interest by homologous recombination. The length of the RHG is from 80 bp to 250‒450 bp, depending on construction method. (B) Serial PCR method. For serial PCR method, 4 rounds of PCR were performed overall. The purpose of the first PCR is for preparation of the KanMX module. Through another 3 rounds of PCR, the RHG of the 80-mer was finally prepared for homologous recombination. (C) Block PCR method. For block PCR method, 4 rounds of PCR were performed overall, as with the serial PCR method. The first PCR is same as the serial PCR method for the preparation of the KanMX module. Two separate PCRs using 51-mer and 25-mer primers and chromosomal DNA as templates were then performed for the preparation of a pair of RHG blocks flanking the KanMX module. Finally, three separated blocks were combined by block PCR. (D) Strategy of colony PCR. For Sanger sequencing, barcode regions were PCR-amplified as indicated. Note that the cp5 and cp3 primers are gene-specific primers. They are around 500 bp apart from the homologous recombination site of each gene deletion cassette. For the sequences of the primers used, refer to “Methods.”
