Chromothripsis-like pattern according to drug treatment
Among the 9 MM cell lines, in particular, KMS-12-BM and KMS-12-PE cells, derived from the same origin, showed different CNA patterns. Thus, changes in CNAs were further analyzed in these cell lines by comparing CNAs after BTZ treatment, which has the most clinical relevance. In order to analyze the drug treatment-induced chromothripsis-like pattern, cell pellets were all collected at the time of treatment. The time frame of the treatment was the same as the schedule in actual clinical practice. Although the cell lines were derived from the same origin, the drug response between the two cell lines was different. In the case of KMS-12-BM, there was no difference in cell viability in the treatment group compared to the control, but in the case of KMS-12-PE, there was a sharp decrease in viability in the treatment group (Fig. 2Aâ€’2D). Analysis of chromothripsis and breakpoints was performed in the cell pellet from Day 11, which represented the end of one cycle of drug treatment.
Compared to the control group, KMS-12-PE, which was considered the drug-sensitive group, did not show any difference in breakpoint events or chromothripsis-like pattern. On the other hand, in the case of drug-resistant KMS-12-BM, breakpoints and chromothripsis-like patterns were increased after drug treatment (Table 2). On analyzing the chromosome arms, the frequency of breakpoints was increased in the q arm versus p arm (p: 111 breakpoints, q: 430 breakpoints).
Of the total chromosomes, the copy number state changed significantly after drug treatment in chr 9. Chr 9 was then further analyzed to compare the gain and loss of genes related to MM (Fig. 2E, F).
A total of 29 of 285 genes that were associated with MM were located in chr 9 [23-31]. Gene gain and loss in chr 9 were analyzed and compared according to drug response, and it was observed that KMS-12-BM, which is resistant to BTZ, showed an increase of CNAs after BTZ treatment (Table 3).
