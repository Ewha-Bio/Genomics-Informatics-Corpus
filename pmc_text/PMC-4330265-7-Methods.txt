Model refinement
Homology-based modeling often contains significant local distortions that render the structure models less useful for high-resolution functional analysis. To refine the predicted protein model, ModRefiner [15], an algorithm for atomic-level, high-resolution protein structure refinement, was used. Protein sequences were given in the FASTA format, and refinement was done for several times to get the most accurate structure.
