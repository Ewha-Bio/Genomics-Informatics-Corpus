Data preparation
The number of Landrace individuals was 1,041 and the number of Yorkshire individuals was 836. Their BF were measured and the genomic DNA of each individual Landrace or Yorkshire pig was genotyped using an Illumina Porcine 60 K SNP Beadchip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Total number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was 62,551 and 62,551 in the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds, respectively. After quality control (minor allele frequency <0.05, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p < 0.0001 and genotyping rate threshold < 0.05), the number of SNPs in the Landrace and Yorkshire breeds was 42,654 and 57,799, respectively. After merging the data of the two breeds, the number of SNPs was 38,002.
