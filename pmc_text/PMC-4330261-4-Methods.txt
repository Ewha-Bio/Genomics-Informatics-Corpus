Cell culture
COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin, before transient transfection. MIN6 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 11.1 mM D-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and the same antibiotics as for COS-7. Cells were cultured at 37℃ in 5% CO2:95% air.
