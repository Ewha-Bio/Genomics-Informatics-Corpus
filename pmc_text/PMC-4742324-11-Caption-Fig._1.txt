Visualization of genome-wide positive selection. Manhattan plots of the degree of selection signals based on pairwise populations of three pig breeds using cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity (A) and cross-population composite likelihood ratio (B). Red lines indicate the significance level and colored dots indicate the genes under significant positive selection.
