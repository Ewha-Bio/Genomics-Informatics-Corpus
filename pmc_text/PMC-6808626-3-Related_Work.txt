The most recent extensive evaluation of existing dependency parsers has been performed by Choi et al. [11]. They evaluate 10 different off-the-shelf parsers for accuracy and speed; reporting labeled attachment scores (LAS) of 85% to 90%. While spaCy does not perform the most accurate in their evaluation, it performs fastest maintaining comparable accuracy. Similar scores are reported in the 2015 SemEval task [12].
Pletscher-Frankild and Jensen [9] note that in text mining literature, tools are often evaluated for accuracy only, omitting practical considerations such as speed and robustness.
Since the publication of the previously mentioned evaluation of dependency parsers [11], new machine learning-based parsers have been published, surpassing existing approaches according to the respective authorsâ€™ own evaluation [13,14]. Amongs them, spaCy was updated to employ a neural network to improve performance [7]. As Yang et al. [15] show, however, domain adaptation remains an issue.
