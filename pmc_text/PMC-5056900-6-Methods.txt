Candidate variant detection (variant filtering)
To filter out false-positives, which were hardly regarded as true somatic mutations or disease driver mutations, we used several additional filtering steps that are generally accepted and generated the final variant calls, as shown in Fig. 1. They included (1) transition-type point mutation; (2) indel >2 bp; (3) normal variants of Inhouse, 1000 Genomes Project, and ExAC_est_Asia (Broad Institute); (4) homozygous-type mutation; (5) conservation <0.3; (6) regions except for missense, splice site, stop gained, and frameshift; (7) total depth <100; and (8) altered allele frequency >0.3 or <0.05 [13].
