Non-coding 886 (nc886) genomic region and sequence. The diagram on the top illustrates the nc886 genomic locus spanning TGFBI and SMAD5 (designated by thick arrows), with arrowheads indicating the direction of transcription. Brown bars are CTCF binding sites. The diagram is not drawn to actual scale. The nc886 region containing a CpG island is magnified in the middle diagram, and the nc886 RNA portion is further magnified in the bottom with the sequence shown. CpG sequences are highlighted in gray. Pol III signatures are in red. This cartoon has been modified from [89]. TGFBI, transforming growth factor Î²-induced; CTCF, CCCTC-binding factor.
