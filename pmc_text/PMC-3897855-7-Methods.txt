Statistical analysis
The results are presented as mean ± standard error range. p-values for each genotype and allele were evaluated by χ2 analysis and Fisher's exact test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between obese subjects and normal-weight subjects of the study. Associations of clinical variables, such as age, BMI, height, weight, and BMR, were analyzed by Pearson correlation test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to develop a BMR equation. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
