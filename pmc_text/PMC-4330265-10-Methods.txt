Docking simulation study
Molecular docking is a computer simulation procedure to calculate the conformation of a receptor-ligand complex. It is used to identify the binding affinity and interaction energy of the molecules with the target protein. Docking analysis was performed by AutoDock Vina [24], which is an automated procedure for predicting the interaction of ligands with bio-macromolecular targets. Before initiating the docking stimulations, phosphoglucosamine mutase protein was modified by adding polar hydrogen, removing all the water molecules, and was also set with the grid box for its binding site, whereas all the torsional bonds of ligands were set free by the ligand module. To evaluate the binding energy on the macromolecule coordinate, a three-dimensional grid box (box size, 76 × 76 × 76 Å; box center, 11 × 90.5 × 57.5 for x, y, and z, respectively) was created using Auto Grid, which calculates the grid map. The combined binding with target protein phosphoglucosamine mutase and ligand, s-mercaptocysteine, was obtained by using PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.5.0.4, Schrödinger, LLC) [25].
