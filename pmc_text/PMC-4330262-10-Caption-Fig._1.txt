Segregation between the group of U2OS-COX-2 and the group of U2OS-pcDNA3. Unsupervised cluster analysis was done between six stable cell lines using 567 probe sets with a standard deviation > 0.5. Normalized log2-gene expression values were used for hierarchical clustering, and an unrooted tree was drawn by R package. COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2.
