Network and pathway analyses
Using 26 genes, we had used IPA (http://www.ingenuity.com/) [8] for network and pathway analyses. It can be summarized in two major networks (Table 2).
The top network is "Cancer, Hematologicial Disease, Cell Cycle," and it has NPM1, GATA2, and CEBPA genes (Figs. 8 and 9). These three genes showed a highly connected network and well-known major driver genes in leukemia.
The second network is related to cell death and survival (Fig. 10). IDH2 and PHF6 genes were located in this network. But overall, somatic mutation frequency in the top network is much higher than the second network above.
IPA analysis reports are summarized in Supplementary Table 8.
