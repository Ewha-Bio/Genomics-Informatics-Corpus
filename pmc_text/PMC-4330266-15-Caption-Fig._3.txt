(A) Ramachandran plot of predicted rpoB model. (B) Ramachandran plot of predicted rpoB (S450L). (C) Ramachandran plot of predicted rpoB (H445Y) mutant models. (D) Zplot of rpoB. (E) Zplot of rpoB (S450L) model. (F) Zplot of rpoB (H445Y). ProSA-web Z-scores of all protein chains in PDB, determined by X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, with respect to their length. The Z-score of rpoB and its mutants were present in that range, represented as black dots.
