Effects of significant BMD loci on BMD at different skeletal sites. Genetic effects are expressed as standardized values and shown for BMD levels measured at the distal radius (BMD-RT; filled circles) and BMD levels measured at the midshaft tibia (BMD-TT; open circles). Horizontal lines represent 95% confidence limits. ars13204965 was seen as significant in women only.
