Chromatin accessibility
Epigenetic mechanisms, such as chromatin accessibility, impact transcription factor binding to DNA, transcriptional specificity, and hence, transcriptional regulation. Open and easily accessible regions of DNA within the chromatin are indicative of local territories of transcriptional activity. Measuring "openness" of DNA at different regions genome-wide, based on the DNase hypersensitivity assay, has helped discover several classes of functional elements, like promoters and enhancers [47]. It has also aided in identifying cell-type specific behaviors by comparison of accessibility profiles [47].
Regions of accessible chromatin are reflective of active regulatory sites. The enzyme DNase I is capable of digesting DNA in nucleosome-depleted regions (i.e., free unwound DNA). Post-digestion sequencing reveals large blocks of DNase hypersensitive sites (DHS) in chromatin (DNase-seq) [25, 48], which, upon further deep sequencing, can reveal up to 40-bp footprints of protected regions (potentially bound by transcription factors). These smaller regions are called digital genomic footprints (DGF) [26]. Formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing is another technique that, by deep-sequencing random fragments of the genome post-crosslinking, measures the frequency of shearing at different loci, thus quantifying accessibility at high resolution, because free DNA that is unbound by factors is more susceptible to shearing [27].
