CDD-BLAST
CD-Search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi/) was done to find out the conserved domain of these protein sequences. This was performed with the use of RPSBLAST, a modified version of PSI-BLAST, to quickly scan a set of predetermined position-specific scoring matriceswith a protein query [19].
