Genetic analysis
Polymorphisms of the MDR1, MRP, and BCRP genes in the Korean population were discovered by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, two-dimensional gene scanning, and direct PCR using methods similar to those described in a previous paper [24]. Genotype screening of each locus in control and epileptic patients was performed by the SNaPshot or SNaPIT method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer.
