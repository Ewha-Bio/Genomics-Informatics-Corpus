Data modeling and data warehouse
Data modeling and warehouse are two key concepts within proper systems architecture for medicine and bioinformatics. The first generation of clinical data warehouses (CDWs) is mostly stored in commercial relational database management systems and collects structured contents, and the healthcare community has developed a large clinical database, which is called the CDW [18]. The extraction, transformation, and load is essential for converting and integrating distributed healthcare data. Ad hoc reporting tools using online analytical processing technology are used to gain intuitive and simple analysis results in clinical informatics.
Bioclinical data warehouses that integrate heterogeneous patient-related clinical or omics data should be considered. Applications analyzing bioclinical data warehouses will include genetic epidemiology and evaluation of decision-support systems before production systems.
In less than a decade, the Human Genome Project has been established to generate a large amount of biological data to practice diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics [19]. The central products using standardized data model are GenBank [20], SWISS-PROT [21], Exon-Intron [22], and IMGT [23].
However, standardized data models for integrated bioclinical data warehouses have not been developed yet. This area will be important to allow researchers to rapidly spread information throughout the world and inspire thousands of research projects.
The experience in designing storages for digital radiological imaging, also known as picture archiving and communication system (PACS), may provide some guidance in bioinformatics data warehouses. In PACS, one has multiple image storages that are not necessarily part of EMR; however, the diagnostic reports are part of the EMR. The PACS images are then made available to physicians as needed.
