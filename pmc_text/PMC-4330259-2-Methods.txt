Study population
Subjects for the GWAS were recruited from the Korean Metabolic Syndrome Research Initiative Study in Seoul City, which was initiated in December 2005. A total of 9,128 individuals were recruited in 2006, and an additional 17,569 individuals were recruited in 2007 [12, 13, 14]. Therefore, the total Seoul City cohort included 26,697 volunteers. Volunteers from the first round underwent routine health examinations at the health promotion centers in university hospitals between January 2006 and December 2007. From this total, 6,563 individuals were randomly selected for measurement of adiponectin levels. The subject characteristics were described in a previous study [14]. In brief, of the 6,563 individuals whose adiponectin was measured, 1,004 individuals were genotyped. The 1,004 subjects were all healthy individuals and were not undergoing any treatment for hyperuricemia. The Institutional Review Board of Human Research of Yonsei University approved the protocols of this study, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment.
