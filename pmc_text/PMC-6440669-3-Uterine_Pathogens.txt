In metagenomic analysis, F. necrophorum was found to be the most abundant species in the uterus, while P. melaninogenica, E. coli, and T. pyogenes were found to be extremely rare (<1% abundance) with no association with metritis [10, 23]. Conversely, E. coli was shown to be associated with uterine health, which conflicts with results from previous studies based on culture methods [23]. Herein, we discuss current understanding of uterine bacteria that are known and newly identified in metagenomic sequencing. P. melaninogenica that was barely detected in metagenomic sequencing [23] and T. pyogenes that is more likely associated with endometritis [30â€“32] are not described in this paper.
