Researchers have long been searching for important disease-associated variants, mainly by investigating functional perturbations caused by nonsynonymous mutations. On the other hand, synonymous mutations have not been considered to be variants that are responsible for showing disease phenotypes. Often, synonymous mutations are filtered out and are not even considered, because candidate variants need to be functionally validated for the possibility of causing diseases or phenotypes. In that sense, it is an interesting revelation that there are various functional activities conducted by synonymous codons in molecular processes. Synonymous mutations do not change the amino acid sequence in proteins but can interrupt the formation of correct mRNA secondary structures, reduce translational accuracy and speed, and even alter the start of transcription. We think that advancing our understanding of the functions of synonymous codons will contribute to the identification of all disease-associated genes and mutations.
