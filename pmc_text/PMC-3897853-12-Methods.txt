SNTB2 knockdown by siRNA
Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 Ã— 105 cells per well. After overnight culture, each well was transfected with 20-40 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with or without IR. The SNTB2 siRNA and negative control siRNA were as follows: SNTB2 (sense: 5'-GUCUCUCUAGGCUGCAUGUdTdT-3', antisense: 5'-ACAUGCAGCCUAGAGAGACdTdT-3') and negative control (sense: 5'-GAUCAUACGUGCGAUCAGAdTdT-3' and antisense: 5'-UCUGAUCGCACGUAUGAUCdTdT-3').
