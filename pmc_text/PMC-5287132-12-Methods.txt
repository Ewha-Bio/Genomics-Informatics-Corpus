Verification and validation of the predicted 3D model
To check the accuracy of the predicted 3D structures, Protein Data Bank Summary (PDBsum; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thorntonsrv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html) was used [29]. The PDBsum generated result was further subjected to documentation analysis by PROgram to CHECK the stereochemical quality of protein structures (PROCHECK) [30]. ERRAT algorithm (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/ERRAT/) helps in the assessment of the protein structure. Verify 3D (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/Verify_3D) Structure Evaluation Server was used for 3D profiling of the residue. Qualitative Model Energy Analysis (QMEAN; http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/cgi/index.cgi) was also done which is a composite scoring function that derives both global and local error estimates on the basis of one single model. Global error is estimated for entire structure and local one for per residue error.
