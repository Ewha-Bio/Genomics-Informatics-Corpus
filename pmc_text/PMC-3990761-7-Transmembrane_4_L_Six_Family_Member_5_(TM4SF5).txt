TM4SF5 in cancer
TM4SF5 (gene ID, 9032) maps to chromosome 17 at 17p13.3 according to Entrez Gene. In AceView, it covers 11.34 kb, from 4621928 to 4633262 (NCBI 36, March 2006), on the direct strand containing 4 different gt-ag introns. Its transcription produces 2 alternatively spliced mRNAs via alternative polyadenylation sites, which putatively encode 2 different isoforms (197 and 132 amino acids), containing an L6 membrane domain (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=35g&c=Gene&l=TM4SF5). TM4SF5 (20,823 Da) is a transmembrane glycoprotein; as a family group, it is related to the tetraspanin family (transmembrane 4 L six family), including TM4SF1 (L6, L6-Ag), TM4SF4 (IL-TIMP), TM4SF518 (L6D), and TM4SF20 [61, 62]. TM4SF5 is highly expressed in diverse types of cancers, including liver, pancreatic, gastric, colon, adrenocorticotropic hormone (corticotropin)-negative bronchial carcinoid tumors, soft-tissue sarcoma, nonendocrine lung, and papilla vateri carcinoma [63, 64, 65, 66]. Similar to tetraspanins (i.e., transmembrane 4 superfamily, TM4SFs), TM4SF5 has four transmembrane domains (TM1-TM4), short cytoplasmic domains at their N- and C-termini, an ICL between TM2 and TM4, two extracellular loops, a smaller extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2, and a larger extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 [61, 62]. Recent clinical studies separately report that TM4SF5 is highly expressed in tumors from deceased breast cancer patients, compared to those from 10-year breast cancer survivors [67], and that postoperative 5-year overall survival of esophageal cancer patients negatively correlates with TM4SF5 expression [68]. These reports suggest that TM4SF5 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis of cancer patients.
