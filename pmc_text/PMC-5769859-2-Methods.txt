Different databases and bioinformatics software were used. Then, the data were reanalyzed and integrated in order to provide a potential model for describing the genetic and epigenetic features of the HOTAIR locus. Table 1 shows list of the in silico tools used in this study and the methodology is represented as a flowchart (Fig. 1). In our analyses, the desired sequence was mostly defined as a sequence that spans from 2 kb upstream of annotated transcription start site (TSS) of HOTAIR to the end of the gene. The selection was based on the previous studies defining putative promoter regions from âˆ’2 kb to +1 kb of the TSS [26]. Some data were analyzed through Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project cited in University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. Encode is a genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging all functional elements in the human genome through related experimental conditions. In addition, all of the software was run with default parameters and criteria. The description of each software and database as well as their criteria of the analyses are described in below.
