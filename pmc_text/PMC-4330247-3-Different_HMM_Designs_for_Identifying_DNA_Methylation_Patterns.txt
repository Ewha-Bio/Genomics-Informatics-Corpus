Genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information follows a basic three-stage design process [13]: conversion of the epigenetic information into genetic information, application of standard DNA techniques, and computational analysis to infer the epigenetic information. All experimental methods for epigenomic annotation generate large amounts of data and require efficient ways of processing the data. In the remainder of this review, we show how HMMs have contributed to answering important epigenetic questions by summarizing HMM-based bioinformatic works, from a computational perspective. Table 1 summarizes the HMM parameters of the three studies that will be reviewed in this paper, in the order of the hidden state complexity.
