Comparison of sequencing and mapping data quality
We sequenced four human colon tumor tissue samples with Illuminaâ€™s HiSeq 4000 and the MGISEQ-2000, and checked the quality of the sequences by running the FastQC program. Overall, the sequence quality of the two platforms was similar. In terms of the Phred score, the MGISEQ-2000 showed a higher percentage for over-Q20 bases, but a lower percentage for over-Q30 bases than the Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Table 1). For over-Q20 bases, the HiSeq 4000 showed an average of 97.84% and the MGISEQ-2000 showed an average of 98.20%. For over-Q30 bases, the HiSeq 4000 showed an average of 94.63% and the MGISEQ-2000 showed an average of 92.60%. For uniquely mapped reads, the MGISEQ-2000 produced better mapping results than the HiSeq 4000 in all four samples (Table 1). On average, the sequencing reads from the MGISEQ-2000 mapped 2.3% more data than the HiSeq 4000.
