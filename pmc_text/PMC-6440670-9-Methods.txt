Sequencing
Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore NNGS equipment (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). First, we enriched the sample to meet the recommended concentration (1 Î¼g of DNA or more). Second, we prepared a sequencing library with the LSK_108 kit from Oxford Nanopore. Third, we loaded the library into the single flow cell attached to the MinION equipment. We conducted the QC procedure to confirm if there were more than 8,000 active nanopores. We ran 2 h for sequencing, and about 10,000 reads were obtained for each sequencing run.
