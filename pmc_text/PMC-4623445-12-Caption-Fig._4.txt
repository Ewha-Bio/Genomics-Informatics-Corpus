Transgenic position of epidermal growth factor (EGF) locus on the rice chromosome 4 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to identify T-DNA junction sequence. (A) The EGF is inserted on the position 31,104,341 of the chromosome 4. (B) The bold with underline is T-DNA sequence of the vector 2,026-2,223 bp and the next bases is rice transgenic locus chromosome 4 (31107341-31107690) in the fragment amplified by PCR test primer1 (5' TACCTGCATGCTGCGGTGAAG 3') and primer2 (5'AGGGCTGTGTAGAAGTACTCGC 3').
