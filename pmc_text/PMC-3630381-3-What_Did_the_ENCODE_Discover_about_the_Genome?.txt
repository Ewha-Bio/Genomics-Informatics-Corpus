DNA methylation and histone modification
The methylation status for the ENCODE cell lines has been obtained by three techniques: 1) sodium bisulfite conversion, 2) reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, and 3) methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (methyl-seq). They profiled the DNA methylation status of over than one million CpG in all ENCODE cell lines and have provided quantitative determination of the proportion of CpG methylation at each site [5, 11, 16-18]. The result has added a lot to our present knowledge of cell-type selective patterns of methylation associated with genomic occupancy of transcriptions factors [17]. The ENCODE team has identified the specific patterns of post-translational histone modifications (e.g., H3K36me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) by ChIP sequencing technique [6]. Then, histone modifications have been connected to the regulatory regions, such as promoters, enhancers, transcribe domains, and silenced regions [6, 11]. The maps of various histone modifications have been constructed genomewide in different cell lines.
