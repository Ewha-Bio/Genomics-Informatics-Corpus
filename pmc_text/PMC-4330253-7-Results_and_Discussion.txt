Genome-wide association study
Table 1 describes the clinical characteristics of Ansung and Ansan regarding the METS criteria: BMI, WC, SBP, DBP, GLU0, HDL, and TG. Based on the NCEP-ATPIII METS criteria for Asians [14], 2,657 KARE subjects were included in the METS cases. The SNPs showing strong and moderate evidence of association (p < 1 × 10-5) are indicated in the Manhattan plot of the GWAS (Fig. 1). In addition to these SNPs, we identified several functional SNPs with suggestive evidence of association (5 × 10-8 ≤ p). In this study, we selected 12 SNPs, of which 2 had genome-wide significant associations (p < 5 × 10-8), 8 had suggestive associations (5 × 10-8 ≤ p < 1 × 10-5), and 2 had functional variants (1 × 10-5 ≤ p < 1 × 10-4) (Table 2) [8, 20, 21, 22]. The top SNP (rs11216126) and 3 suggestive SNPs (rs6589566, rs174 82753, and rs10503669) were previously reported as being associated with METS-related traits, such as serum cholesterol levels or TG levels [8, 20, 21].
LD analysis using 10 SNPs was conducted with the previously reported GWAS SNPs. As a result, 5 SNPs had strong LD with the 15 highly linked GWAS SNPs (Table 3) [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Among the 6 remaining SNPs associated with METS in our GWAS results, 2 SNPs (rs180349 and rs17410962) showed high LD with the previously reported SNPs (r2 > 0.9 and D' = 1) even though the 2 SNPs have not been reported regarding metabolic traits.
Therefore, we discovered 10 significant or suggestive associated SNPs in the METS GWAS, but 6 of them were already reported or linked to the reported SNPs. The remaining 4 suggestive signals and 2 functional variants have been first reported in the current study, and a replication study should be performed in other independent populations.
