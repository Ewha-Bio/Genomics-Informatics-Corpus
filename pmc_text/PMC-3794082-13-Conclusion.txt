Over the last few years, metagenomics has accelerated the understanding of microbial ecology and evolution, thanks to the technical advances of sequencing platforms. Metagenomics itself is not a panacea that is able to answer all unresolved questions and uncover the 'dark matter' of our knowledge in microbial diversity and function studies, but it is undoubtedly an excellent tool, giving insight into completing the jigsaw puzzles of our understanding of the surrounding biosphere by exploring both 'who is out there' and 'what they do' in nature. It is true that studying metagenomics is still recognized by ordinary microbial ecologists as a tool that is difficult to tackle due to its complexity and the enormous amount of sequence data that needs to be dealt with. However, it is not surprising that we will witness 'doing metagenomics' in the future as if we routinely do PCR and gel electrophoresis in our laboratory. Current development of tools and databases for metagenomic studies is in its infancy, and there are still many challenges to overcome. It will not take long to see an explosive growth of metagenomics with a revolution of metagenomic bioinformatics.
