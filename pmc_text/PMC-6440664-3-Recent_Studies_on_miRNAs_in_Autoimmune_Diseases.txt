With the growing evidence of the important biological roles of miRNAs in autoimmune diseases, such as immune cell lineage determination, differentiation, proliferation, and immune regulation, the identification of unique miRNA markers has provided invaluable information in understanding their potential roles in autoimmune disease pathogenesis. The complexity of the biological roles of miRNAs partly stems from the fact that a single miRNA targets multiple downstream molecules and a single target gene may be regulated by multiple miRNAs. In this section, recent studies on miRNAs in common autoimmune conditions and their potential roles are briefly described before extensive discussions on differentially expressed miRNAs in SjS.
