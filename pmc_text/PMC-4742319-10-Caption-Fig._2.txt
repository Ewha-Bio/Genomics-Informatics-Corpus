AT-skew versus A + T content (%) of complete mitochondrial (mt) DNA genomes in Crocodylia. Values are calculated on heavy strands for full length of mtDNA genomes from 23 crocodilians [7911121314151724]. The x-axis indicates the skew values, the y-axis provides the A + T content (%). The wide fine dashed line indicates the Crocodylus relation between AT-skew versus A + T content, whereas the solid line and the dashed line display the Alligatoridae and Crocodylidae relations, respectively.
