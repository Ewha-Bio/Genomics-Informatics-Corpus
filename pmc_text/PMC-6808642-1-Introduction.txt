In 1986, David Barker proposed the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, denoted fetal reprogramming, that the environmental stimuli such as nutrients during vulnerable development stages may permanently program change of organ structure and function of the offspring toward the development of non-communicable diseases [1]. Since Barker’s observation, denoted fetal programming, it is widely recognized that nutrient during pregnancy and lactation is one of the modifiable risk factors for adult chronic diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular diseases [2]. Following the DOHaD concept, early-life environmental factors such as nutrients may modulate the development of the gut microbiota [3]. It is postulated that the gut microbiome can be shaped by nutrients, which induce epigenetic changes prior to fetal and infant programming of disease.
In this review, we describe how early nutrients link microbiome modulation and influence the early epigenome. We refer the term “early-life” to the period from pregnancy to 2 years of age. Moreover, we assess the early-life gut microbiome as epigenetic modifiers are associated with early-onset or adult diseases including metabolic disorders. In detail, section 2 reviews the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms for metabolic signaling through nutrients and their metabolites as epigenetic substrates or cofactors. Section 3 provides several early environmental factors that may modulate early microbial communities. Section 4 describes the effects of each nutrient on gut microbiome changes in early-life through epigenetic mechanisms and the potential role of the gut microbiome in adult disease.
