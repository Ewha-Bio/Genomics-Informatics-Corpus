Visualization showing the mapping by a probset. Probeset "212022_s_at" is applied to specify the colors across the population; green color corresponds to high values and red color corresponds to low values. It indicates clearly the significant difference of patients in the bottom-left cluster, who are mostly painted with "greenish" colors corresponding to the high values, in comparison to reddish colors corresponding to the low values.
