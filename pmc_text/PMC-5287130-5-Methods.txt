Statistical analyses
For each tissue, the correlation between gene expression level of desired genes and compositional features of CDS/protein was analyzed by Graphpad. p-values less than 0.01 were considered as significant. However, in some tissues, because of lacking the p-value less than 0.01, we considered the characteristics with p-values less than 0.05 as the most significant features. Finally, in order to determine truly significant features, false discovery rate (FDR) was analyzed through the FDR online calculator (http://www.sdmproject.com/utilities/?show=FDR) which its method coincides with the R code of the version proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg.
