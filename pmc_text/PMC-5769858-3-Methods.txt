Protein structure prediction
The full sequence (leader peptide of the model plus the native sequence of proinsulin) of each fused protein was used as an input for the structure prediction. Among various methods of 3D protein structure prediction, we used I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) [14], which ranked as first in performance in recent community-based competitions [15, 16].
