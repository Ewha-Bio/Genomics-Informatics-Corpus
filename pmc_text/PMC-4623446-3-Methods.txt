Implementations
The system architecture consists of various software frameworks for robust activity. Our system was mainly implemented with JAVA-based environment. To provide user friendly and active interfaces, the ICEfaces (version 3.3.0, http://www.icesoft.org/) framework was used. To store and handle the datasets, the MySQL database management system was used (version 5.5.11, http://dev.mysql.com). Data queries on MySQL from JAVA are controlled by MyBatis, an XML-based SQL mapping framework (version 3.1.1, https://code.google.com/p/mybatis). All statistical analysis methods were implemented using R (version 3.0.1, http://www.r-project.org) with Bioconductor plugins (version 2.12, http://www.bioconductor.org). Calling R modules from JAVA is managed by the RCaller framework (version 2.1.1, https://code.google.com/p/rcaller). All services are hosted on an Apache Tomcat web server (version 6.0.26, http://tomcat.apache.org). A schematic diagram of the system architecture is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
