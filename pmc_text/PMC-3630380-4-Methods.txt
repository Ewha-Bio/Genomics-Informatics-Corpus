Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and genotyping
In the discovery stage, six SNPs were selected from a public SNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) for the genotyping assay: 1) polymorphic in Chinese and Japanese; 2) tag SNPs in Asian; 3) might have functionality in protein or expression level. The selected SNPs were 1) one SNP in the 5' flanking region (rs2808426); 2) three intronic SNPs (rs10902662, rs1316896, and rs4908351); 3) one SNP in the untranslated region (rs1141747); and 4) one SNP in the 3' flanking region (rs2808430). The genotyping was performed using the GoldenGate kit according to a standard protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Oligos were amplified by allele-specific primer extension. After hybridization to a sentrix array matrix, signal intensities were read by BeadArray Reader (Illumina Inc.). Genotyping analysis was performed using GenomeStudio software (version 1.5.16; Illumina Inc.).
In the replication stage, rs2808426, which was identified in the discovery stage, was genotyped using Taqman technology. The probes were labeled with FAM or VIC dye at the 5' end and a minor groove binder and nonfluorescent quencher at the 3' end. All reactions were performed following the supplier's protocol. SNP genotyping reactions were performed on the ABI PRISM 7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After the PCR amplification, allelic discrimination was performed on the ABI PRISM 7900HT. Allele calls were made with SDS v2.4 software (Applied Biosystems).
