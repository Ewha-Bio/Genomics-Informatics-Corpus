Dataset
Whole-exome sequencing data of tumor/normal paired samples from 10 individuals with blood cancer were obtained in FASTQ format from PGM21 (The National Project for Personalized Genomic Medicine). For 10 of the samples, the genotype information from single nucleotide poymorphism (SNP) chip was additionally obtained (but not the raw data).
