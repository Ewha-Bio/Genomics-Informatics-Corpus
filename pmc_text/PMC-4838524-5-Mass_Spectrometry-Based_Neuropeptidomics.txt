Mass Spectrometry-Based Peptidomics
In contrast to immuno-based methods, mass spectrometry (MS) enables one to detect and identify the precise forms of neuropeptides without a priori knowledge of the peptide's identity, resulting in the identification of previously unknown neuropeptides. MS has been used to identify and characterize hundreds of endogenous peptides in various animals [2526272829]. The high-throughput discovery of neuropeptides based on MS has made up the field of peptidomics (Fig. 2) [630313233]. While typical proteomic analysis involves the digestion of proteins using proteases, such as trypsin, to generate peptides that can be readily sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), peptidomics focuses on the analysis of the native peptide forms, including PTMs, without using digestive enzymes. Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize as many neuropeptides as possible, because each peptide can have its own biological function. While MS-based peptidomics can be utilized to characterize a large number of neuropeptides simultaneously, it can be also applied to the quantification of individual neuropeptides.
