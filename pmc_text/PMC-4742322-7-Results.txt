HLA-DRB1─HLA-DQB1 haplotype analysis
The HLA-DRB1─HLA-DQB1 haplotype frequencies in 11 fulminant T1DM cases and 413 Korean Reference Panel subjects are shown in Table 2. We focused on five haplotypes that were reported to be significantly associated with either increased (HLA-DRB1*04:05─HLA-DQB1*04:01, HLA-DRB1*09:01─HLA-DQB1*03:03) or decreased (HLA-DRB1*01:01─HLA-DQB1*05:01, HLA-DRB1*15:02─HLADQB1*06:01, and HLA-DRB1*08:03─HLA-DQB1*06:01) risk of fulminant T1DM in Japanese. We found that the frequency of the HLA-DRB1*04:05─HLA-DQB1*04:01 haplotype was 0.27 in Korean fulminant T1DM cases and 0.08 in the Korean Reference Panel. This haplotype was significantly associated with a risk of fulminant T1DM by Fisher's exact test (OR, 4.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 to 10.86; p=0.009). None of the other haplotypes showed a significant association presumably due to the limited statistical power.
