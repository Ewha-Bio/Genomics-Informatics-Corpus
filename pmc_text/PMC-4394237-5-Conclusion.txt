A. baumannii employs specialized systems that are required for iron acquisition in iron-limited host environments [16]. In this review, we described the genes of A. baumannii that are involved in acinetobactin biosynthesis and transport. A number of studies have identified the genes that are essential for iron acquisition [13, 15, 16, 17]. Especially, the data presented in this review indicate that A. baumannii strains have genetic diversity in the acinetobacter gene cluster. Even though the roles of the additional genes in acinetobactin cluster in different. A. baumannii strains are not characterized, we suggest that the genes could be associated with A. baumannii virulence. Therefore, functional analysis of the genes in the bacteria is required. Furthermore, we showed both a single entA functional ortholog and variability in the bacterial genome. Therefore, we suggest that A. baumannii has continuously evolved the iron acquisition mechanism, which is associated with acinetobactin from different sources by horizontal gene transfer.
