The concept of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). If transcript abundance depends on the genotype of a genomic locus, such a region is called an eQTL. If an eQTL is found inside or near the boundary of the target gene, it is classified as cis-regulatory (A); otherwise, it is trans-regulatory (B). In the latter case, the expression level of a target gene is not regulated by its cis-eQTL but through a regulator, such as a transcription factor (TF), whose expression is regulated by its cis-element.
