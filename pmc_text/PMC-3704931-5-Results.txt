Table 2 presents the sample and pedigree information. The number of total samples used in this study is 229. The portion of females (58.95%) was higher than males (41.05%). In the pedigree information, the size of each pedigree ranged from 2 to 94. One large extended family (n = 94) provided great statistical power to estimate the inheritance of facial measurements. The number of parent-offspring and sibling pairs was 412 and 191, respectively. Among sibling pairs, the number of brother-sister pairs was the largest (93 pairs). The number of sister-sister and brother-brother pairs was 54 and 44, respectively.
Basic statistics for the 14 original measurements in males and females are summarized in Table 3. Only those results with age ≥ 20 were considered, to account for the variable introduced by age. The mean value for males (n = 79) was significantly higher than females (n = 120) in all measurements (p < 0.05).
Familial correlations and heritabilities of residual variation, adjusted by significant covariates, are presented in Table 4. The mean contribution of significant covariates was 0.27 and ranged from 0.10 to 0.51. As shown, the spousal correlations (p ≥ 0.05), which represent the impacts of a common environment and partially assortative mating, were lower than the other correlations in most measurements. Except for height of the lower face (sn-gn), width of the mandible (go-go), length of the eye fissure (en-ex), width of the mouth (ch-ch), and length of the auricle (sa-sba), the correlations between parent and offspring were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The correlations between siblings were statistically significant for width of the mandible (go-go), nasal protrusion (sn-prn), and length of the auricle (sa-sba). The heritabilities of 13 facial measurements, except for width of the mouth (ch-ch), were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. The heritability of intercanthal width (en-en) in the orbital region was found to be the highest (h2 = 0.61, SE = 0.14), whereas in the nose region, width of the nose (al-al) showed the highest heritability (h2 = 0.53, SE = 0.13).
Table 5 shows the pattern of rotated factors by factor analysis with 14 facial measurements. We obtained 3 factors whose eigenvalue was greater than 1. Factors were denoted according to loading scores of rotated factors above 0.6 [22, 23]. Factor 1 included 4 measurements: height of the lower face (sn-gn), width of the mandible (go-go), width of the nose (al-al), and width of the mouth (ch-ch). Factor 2 included intercanthal width (en-en), biocular width (ex-ex), and length of the eye fissure (en-ex), which were related to the orbital region. Factor 3 included physiognomical height of the face (tr-gn), special upper face height (g-sn), and height of the nose (n-sn). The familial correlations and heritabilities of 3 factors are shown in Table 6. In Factor 1, the correlation of spouse (p ≥ 0.05) was lower than that of parent-offspring and sibling pairs, whereas meaningful familial correlations were not found in Factor 2 or Factor 3. The heritabilities of 3 factors were statistically significant (p < 0.05) and ranged from 0.45 to 0.55. Factor 1, which was related to the lower face, had the highest value for heritability (h2 = 0.55, SE = 0.12).
Using a bivariate model, we examined genetic correlations for all pairs within each factor (Table 7). There were several pairs with a statistically significant genetic correlation (p ≤ 0.05): the pair of height of the lower face (sn-gn) and width of the nose (al-al) (ρG = 0.79, SE = 0.23) for Factor 1, the pair of intercanthal width (en-en) and biocular width (ex-ex) (ρG = 0.82, SE = 0.08) and the pair of biocular width (ex-ex) and length of the eye fissure (en-ex) (ρG = 0.81, SE = 0.09) for Factor 2, and the pair of physiognomical height of the face (tr-gn) and special upper face height (g-sn) (ρG = 0.74, SE = 0.17) and the pair of special upper face height (g-sn) and height of the nose (n-sn) (ρG = 0.98, SE = 0.06) for Factor 3.
