A 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled diabetes mellitus was admitted for glycemic control. She was diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus at an age of 14 (fasting plasma glucose 137 mg/dL, postprandial 2-h glucose 239 mg/dL), with normal body mass index (21.9 kg/m2) and 24-h urine C-peptide level (83.3 µg/day; reference range, 50 to 100µg/day). Although autoantibodies for pancreatic β-cell were not detected, she required insulin therapy for glycemic control. Her serum C-peptide level decreased from 1.8 ng/mL to 0.9 ng/mL during the past year. The total daily insulin requirement was 0.68 IU/kg. The patient's father (diagnosed in his early 30s) and grandmother (the age of diagnosis was unknown) also had diabetes. She did not have urogenital anomalies.
Sequencing of HNF1B revealed a heterozygous P159L point mutation (CCT to CTT in codon 159) in the patient. Among the three other family members, her father was found to have the identical mutation. The pedigree of diabetes mellitus and the result of Sanger sequencing are shown in Fig. 1. This nonsynonymous variant co-segregated according to the affected state of diabetes within the family.
Two point mutations, P159L and H153N (for comparison as functionally proven mutations; i.e., positive control), were generated by in vitro mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis confirmed that the mutant protein was apparently expressed in the transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3A). The region, including nucleotide -1030 of human GLUT2 promoter, which is known to be the cis-element for HNF-1β binding [24], was inserted into the luciferase vector (Fig. 3B). Luciferase activity of the human GLUT2 promoter was increased with overexpression of wild-type HNF-1β compared to the control (p < 0.05 vs. control) (Fig. 3C). When P159L HNF-1β and H153N HNF-1β were expressed, a significant reduction of transcription activity was observed (p < 0.05 vs. wild-type, respectively). In the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the proteins of the expected sizes were translated (Fig. 4A). The EMSA showed that wild-type HNF-1β protein bound well to the GLUT2 promoter, but the mutant proteins had decreased binding activity (Fig. 4B).
The mRNA levels of GLUT2 and INS in MIN6 cells after HNF1B transfection were also investigated. The transfection into MIN6 was confirmed with an efficiency of 60% to 65% (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis showed that the protein expression was well preserved after transfection (Fig. 5B). The quantitated mRNA levels were normalized to that of 18S. When the wild-type HNF-1β was overexpressed, the relative mRNA level of GLUT2 was increased by 2.3-fold (p < 0.05 vs. control) (Fig. 5C). Compared to the wild-type HNF-1β, the relative mRNA levels of GLUT2 for the H153N and P159L mutants were significantly decreased (p < 0.05 vs. wild-type, respectively). There was no significant difference in the mRNA expression level of INS among the four groups (Fig. 5D).
