Inverse variance-weighted average method
We first describe the two methods for the fixed effects model meta-analysis: the IVW and weighted SZ. The fixed effects model assumes that all studies in a meta-analysis share a single true effect size [2182223]. The underlying mathematical model of the observed effect Xi can be shown as: Xi = µ + ei, (1) where µ is the true effect size and ei (the deviation of Xi from µ) is the error in the observation and i = 1,2,…,C. In order to integrate multiple observed effect sizes X1,…,XC from multiple studies, the weighted mean approach has been suggested [22], X¯=∑WiXi∑Wi. (2)
A choice of weight Wi is not immediately evident, but several attempts were made to identify the optimal weight of the methods based on empirical evidence [172024]. Ideally, one needs to put more weight on the studies with more precision against studies with lower precision [32526]. When the sample size of each study is sufficiently large, we can assume that Xi follows a normal distribution approximately, based on the central limit theorem. This applies to situations where the data themselves are not normal (e.g., binary), in which situation the test statistic still follows a normal distribution, as long as the sample size is large. In GWASs, this assumption holds easily, because the sample size is typically as large as thousands of samples. Note that all derivations in this paper are based on this normality assumption. Let SE(Xi) be the estimated standard error of Xi, and Vi = SE(Xi)2. It is common practice to consider the estimated variance Vi as the true variance. The inverse variance-weighted average effect size estimator is the weighted mean of Xi with the weights [22]: Wi = Vi−1. (3)
Given these weights, the standard error of the average effect size X¯ becomes SEX¯=∑Wi−1. The statistical significance can be tested by constructing a z-score statistic of IVW as follows, which asymptotically follows N(0,1) under the null hypothesis of no effects.

The p-value of the two-tailed significance test is p = 2Φ(−|ZIVW|), (5) where Φ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.
