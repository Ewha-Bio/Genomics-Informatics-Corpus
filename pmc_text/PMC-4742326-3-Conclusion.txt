One of the strengths of our work versus previous studies is that we profiled the core elements separately, based on the three classes of promoter states (Active_Promoter, Weak_Promoter, and Poised_Promoter of the ChromHMM). A more detailed analysis of frequency profiles in regard to these three states is beyond the scope of this paper. However, the complete frequency profiles and Java code are published through GitHub (https://github.com/KyungEunLee/motif). We believe that the frequency profiles presented of the three promoter states can be helpful for bioinformaticians to gain a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the various promoter regions and to improve upon old methods of core promoter analysis algorithms for their specific research needs.
