Similarity search and domain prediction
Similarly search was carried out for selected proteins using BLASTP algorithm against Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). The closest homolog for each selected target protein was considered as template based on lowest e-value and highest percentage of similarity The conserved domain region of potential drug target was predicted using conserved domain database (CDD) of NCBI web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi) with default parameters (Fig. 1B).
