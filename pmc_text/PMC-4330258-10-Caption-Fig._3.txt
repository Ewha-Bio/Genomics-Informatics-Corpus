Regional plot of three discovered variants. (A-C) p-value plots showing the association signals in the region of KIAA0232 on chromosome 4 (A), SH2B3 on chromosome 12 (B), and BAK1 on chromosome 6 (C). In the top panel, the association signals scaled by -log10(p-value) (typed or imputed SNPs) at each locus are distributed in a genomic region 500 kb to either side of the lead association signal (typed). Each SNP is plotted as a circle along the chromosomal position, and linkage disequilibrium between the lead SNP and the other SNPs is colored as a scale from low (blue) to high (red) or is colored gray if linkage disequilibrium information was not available in the 1,000 genomes June 2010 CHB+JPT samples. The lead SNP is colored purple diamond, and the overall meta-analysis result is shown with a purple circle. The recombination rate estimated from HapMap phase 2 is plotted in blue. The bottom panel illustrates the locations of known genes. Genetic information is based on NCBI build 36 and dbSNP build 130. SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; CHB, Han Chinese in Beijing, China; JPT, Japanese in Tokyo, Japan.
