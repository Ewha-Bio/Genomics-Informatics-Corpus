In this study, we investigated the effect of SNP marker density on haplotype block partition by comparing the haplotype block partition results based on subsets of the entire SNPs in the region. We observed that using only 20% of the original markers, the number of blocks produced by these methods reduces to 30%–40% and the average length of the blocks increases to 1.8–2.4 times of the results obtained using all SNPs. The effect of the density on the discovery of common haplotype blocks using a subset of the original marker set was almost linear for CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++, and even exponential for FGT and SS methods as the density increases.
We could observe that the three haplotype block partition methods (CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++) based on the definition of haplotype block by Gabriel et al. [8] tend to preserve more common blocks compared to the other two methods (FGT and SS) with low density marker sets. However, even for CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++, the proportions of common blocks preserved with low density marker set decrease to below about 20% using 40% of the original markers when we decide 80% overlap as the common blocks considering only non-singleton blocks. Also, with low density marker sets of 20% or 40% SNPs, more than 75% or 65% haplotype blocks constructed from these low density sets were not found by the results using the entire SNP markers. In summary, the results using the entire SNP marker sets and results using less than half of the marker sets of the same dataset were quite different in all methods investigated in this study.
The FGT methods usually produces smaller size haplotype blocks than the other methods, and the SS methods produces bigger size haplotype blocks than the rest of the methods. However, both methods show low rates of finding common haplotype blocks from the dataset with different density levels compared to CI, PLINK-MIG++, and S-MIG++. Both methods define a haplotype block if strong LD is maintained for all SNPs with each other (FGT) or with the first and last SNPs (SS). From the 1000G dataset with the full set of all SNPs, we could observe that some extensive LD regions where the strong LD is shown between some non-consecutive markers which cannot be considered as in the same block region by FGT or SS by their definition the haplotype block. Consequently, these LD regions are split into small regions when using high density SNP markers, but with low density markers, there are more chance to find bigger haplotype block. The most of haplotype block partition methods have been developed using relatively low density such as the HapMap data rather than the whole genome sequencing data such as the 1000 Genomes Project [10]. The recent methods such as PLINK-MIG++ and S-MIG++ is mere computational improvement of the CI method resulting in similar block partition results as the Haploview-CI algorithm. This study shows that researchers should be very careful when they use the haplotype block construction results from reference panel data for the analysis and interpret genetic analysis using different genotype data with different marker density. Also, there is need for a new method that finds more marker-independent haplotype blocks regardless of the selection of the SNP markers, especially the one that works well for high density SNP markers such as 1000 Genomes Project dataset.
