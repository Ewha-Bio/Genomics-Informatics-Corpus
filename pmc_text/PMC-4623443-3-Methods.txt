Total RNA extraction from fresh tissues and plasma
Venous blood from all subjects was collected into sterile ethylenediamine tetracetic aci-coated vials. Within 1 h, samples were centrifuged (2,000 ×g, 10 min), following which the plasma was removed, aliquoted, and stored at -80℃ until isolation of the circulating RNA. Total RNA was isolated from 300 µL of plasma using the Ambion PARIS Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA from tissue samples was extracted with the miRNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and finally eluted into 80 µL of elution solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. The total RNAs isolated from plasma and tissues were stored at -80℃ until further use.
