RSEM is software that quantifies transcript-level abundance from RNA-seq data. RSEM is operated in two steps: (1) generation and preprocessing of a set of reference transcript sequences and (2) alignment of reads to the reference transcripts followed by estimation of transcript abundances and their credibility intervals. A FASTA formatted file of transcript sequences is used to generate the reference transcripts, which can be obtained from a reference genome database, a de novo transcriptome assembler, or an Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database. Alternatively, a gene annotation file in GTF format and the full genome sequence in FASTA format may be supplied. RSEM uses the Bowtie alignment program [15]. A user-provided aligner can be used for mapping RNA-seq reads using reference transcripts. RSEM provides gene-level and isoform-level estimates as the primary output by computing maximum likelihood abundance estimates based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm after read mapping. Abundance estimates are given in terms of two measures: an estimate of the number of fragments and the estimated fraction of transcripts comprising a given isoform or gene. The latter estimates can be multiplied by 10-6 to obtain a measure of transcripts per million (TPM). RSEM also supports the visualization of alignment and read depth using a genome browser such as the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser.
