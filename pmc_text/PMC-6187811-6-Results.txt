Evaluation of defects in barcodes
An examination of the DNA sequences obtained from the 7734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 6,695 barcodes (86.6%) had no sequence mutation within them (Table 2). In detail, 2,920 strains (5,840 barcodes, 75.5%) had no mutation on either barcode, and 855 strains (855 barcodes, 11.1%) had mutation(s) only on either barcode. In other words, 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) had mutation(s) in the 20-mer molecular barcodes. It is noteworthy that the mutation rate of barcodes made by block PCR was higher by 4.3% than by serial PCR (14.9% vs. 10.6%). It is likely that the key process in block PCR, block-joining, is complicated and creates mutation(s). Among the 1,039 mutated barcodes, 855 mutations were found on either barcode, and 184 mutations were found on both barcodes.
Within the 1,039 mutated barcodes out of the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, 1,284 mutations were found in total, resulting in a mutation rate of 16.6%. There was no significant difference in mutation rate between up-tags and down-tags. When type of mutation was considered for the 1284 mutations (16.6% in total), substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). The overall mutation rate was similar between both yeasts (16.6% vs. 18%). Insertions and deletions occurred at a much lower frequency than substitutions. The frequency of insertions (1.6%) was 1 order of magnitude lower than that of substitutions (10.9%).
