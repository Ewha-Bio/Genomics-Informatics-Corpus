Genomic DNA amplification using the Phi29 DNA polymerase
The DNA plug did not show any detectable amount of DNA when analyzed using PFGE. The GenomiPhi DNA Amplification Kit (Amersham Biosciences) is claimed to have very high sensitivity for DNA detection; the smallest trace of DNA should be amplified if present. In the protocol provided with the amplification kit, it is recommended that the amplification reaction be started with 10 ng of DNA. Although the results initially showed that the concentrated samples did not contain any detectable amount of DNA, the amplification procedure was continued with these samples. The control (DNase free water) and the DNA isolated from the Prebiocide and Tank A samples showed a similarly positive pattern after DNA amplification, which seemed to be nonspecific due to the contamination of the Φ29 DNA polymerase enzyme with exogenous DNA (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the positive controls, such as lambda DNA, showed significant amplification of up to 20-30 µg in a 20-µL reaction. The distribution of the amplified DNA ranged from 20 to 40 kb. Repeated trials of less than 3 h did not result in any amplification; however, a DNA product was noted after 6 h of incubation. The size of the amplified DNA (between 20 kb and 40 kb) was determined by PFGE.
The GenomiPhi DNA Amplification Kit manual explains that nonspecific amplification usually occurs, even in the absence of template DNA, because of the presence of random primers and the high amplification performance capability of the enzyme. In order to confirm whether the amplified DNA had been specifically amplified from the genomic DNA template, 1 µg of each of the amplified DNA samples was digested with HindIII (Fig. 2B). Several fragmented DNA bands with expected sizes were observed in the digestion reaction of the amplified DNA from the lambda (positive control), Prebiocide, Tank A, and control samples, showing that the amplification was specific. Smeared bands of indigestible DNA were also obtained because of partial and/or nonspecific amplification of the genomic DNA.
