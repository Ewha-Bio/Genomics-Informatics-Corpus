Prediction model building and detailed study of selected genes
Along with selected genetic markers and clinical variables we fitted a multiple Cox regression model. For further integrated study of the selected gene markers, we grouped patients into two groups in terms of fitted hazard ratios as high- and low-risk groups. Then, log rank test was performed to test for homogeneity of survival rates between the two groups. Also, a functional study for the selected gene markers using a pathway database was provided for biological understanding [16].
