SNP allele frequency distribution of the two cohorts
We examined the allele frequencies of genome-wide SNPs in the two cohorts, using 358,085 autosomal SNPs from 2,938 samples (total genotyping rate, 0.996). Table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the allele frequency distribution in each cohort. These statistics did not show any distinctive differences between the two cohorts. In addition, Fig. 2A and 2B show the patterns of the MAF differences. We performed the K-S test, a general nonparametric method for comparing the density distributions of two datasets. Fig. 2C shows a plot of the empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) curves of the two cohorts. The K-S test returns a D statistic, which refers to the absolute maximum distance between the ECDF of the two samples and a p-value corresponding to the D statistic. D was 0.015 and the p-value was 0.819; therefore, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the two datasets were drawn from the same distribution.
