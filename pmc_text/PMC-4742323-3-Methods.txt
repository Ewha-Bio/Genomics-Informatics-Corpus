Statistical tests
We used R (v 3.1.3) for all statistical tests (https://cran.r-project.org/). Using the factoMineR (http://factominer.free.fr) and rgl (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgl/) packages, principal component analysis (PCA) and visualization were performed [11]. The survival packages were used (http://r-forge.r-project.org) to compare patient survival rates and draw Kaplan-Meier plots. The coxph function in the survival packages was used for performing the Cox regression analysis [1213].
