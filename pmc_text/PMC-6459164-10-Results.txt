DCGPs and protein sublocalization changes
One emergent subnetwork associated with vesicle-mediated transport might be linked to the possibility that changes in protein subcellular localization play an important role in COPD development. Protein localization was predicted, based on gene expression profiles (Fig. 5A). To construct a co-expression network, gene expression profiles were converted into another format, and co-expression relationships of gene pairs were measured using MICs [23].
Two genes were regarded as DCGPs if the absolute MIC changes between COPD and normal subjects was greater than 0.4. Under this condition, 139 up-regulated pairs and 303 down-regulated pairs in COPD could be identified (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Table 2). In PCA with the DCGPs, there was a clear difference between COPD samples and normal samples (Fig. 5C), even though they showed variability between samples that was not large as with the DEGs (PC1, 0.102; PC2, 0.008; and PC3, 0.005). The prediction model with the DCGPs exhibited good performance (AUC, 0.946). Sixty-two genes among 424 genes in 442 DCGPs overlapped significantly with DEGs (hypergeometric test, p= 3.146e-16), but the remaining 362 genes were not matched to DEGs (Fig. 5D). These results imply that DCGPs could be complementary to DEGs for understanding gene expression profiles.
The prediction of protein subcellular localization is exemplified in Fig. 6A. A mitochondrial protein, NDUFA12, was selected, because it had 8 interacting proteins and showed coherent changes in all interactions. The predicted chance of NDUFA12 translocating toward 12 mitochondria was increased in COPD (43.8%), compared with normal tissue (25.5%). In COPD, protein interactions between NDUFA12 and other mitochondrial proteins were reinforced. However, the actual protein sublocalization changes were expected to be much more complex when considering all protein interactions. Our analysis workflow was designed to include all protein interactions and thus predicted the probabilities of 10 subcellular locations of each protein for each status (Fig. 5A). Out of 76 significant subcellular localization changes between COPD and normal tissue, 19 (25.0%) were related to mitochondria and 52 (68.4%) were related to the nucleus (Fig. 6B).
The predicted probabilities of subcellular locations of the mitochondria-related proteins were examined (Fig. 6C). Except for ILF3, all proteins showed higher chances of localizing to mitochondria in COPD than in normal tissue. Seven of them were mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and other proteins, such as CYC1, ATP5C1, NDUFA12, C1QBP, ATP5A1, SDHB, ATP5O, ECH1, ACADVL, and SFXN3, acted on the matrix of mitochondria. Collectively, proteins targeting mitochondria might be influenced by mitochondrial dysfunction in COPD.
