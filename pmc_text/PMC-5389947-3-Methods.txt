Codon Adaptation Index (CAI)
The CAI [17] measures the deviation of a given protein coding gene sequence with respect to a reference set of genes. It defines translationally optimal codons as those appear frequently in highly expressed genes. The CAI model assigns a parameter, termed ‘relative adaptiveness’ to each of the 61 codons (stop codons excluded). Relative adaptiveness (wi) is obtained by normalizing the frequency of each synonymous codons by the frequency of the most frequent codon. So, relative adaptiveness for most frequent codon is 1 and other codon is less than 1. The CAI of a gene is simply the geometric average of the relative adaptiveness of all codons in a gene sequence, CAI=∏1Nwi1N and wi=fifaa,max, where fi is the frequency of codon i, and faa,max is the maximum frequency of the codon most often used for encoding amino acid aa in a set of highly expressed genes of the particular genome. N is the number of codons in the gene. CAI ranges from 0 to 1. The higher are the CAI values, the genes are more likely to be highly expressed.
