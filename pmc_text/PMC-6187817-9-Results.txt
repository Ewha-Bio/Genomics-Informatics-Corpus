GSTM1 null genotype and drug-related AE
The number of drug-related AEs and the number of subjects with drug-related AEs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects, although it failed to reach statistical significance (Table 2). Furthermore, the AEs were more severe in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Three subjects in the GSTM1 null group experienced AEs with moderate severity, whereas none in the GSTM1 functional group experienced those AEs. Those AEs were feeling hot, feeling cold and a burning sensation, and these sensations are frequently reported AEs in TRPV1 antagonist class drugs [17, 18].
