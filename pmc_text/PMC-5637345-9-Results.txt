Bioinformatic analyses of target genes
PPIL2 is one of the target genes that have the highest MFE level and it was chosen to study the interaction with miR-21-3p due to its ‒30.3 kcal/mol for MFE score. GGI network was used to identify functional roles of target genes, where several genes such as PPM1F, DGCR2, ASCC2, LZTR1, and MVD were found to be co-expressed with PPIL2. The physical interaction function was associated with PRCC, PIM2, BSG, ZNF830, CRNKL1, and KANSL2. CWF19L1, a member of the CWF19 protein family, which controls the cell cycle was predicted to have a correlation with PPIL2. PPIL3, MED15, and DGCR14 showed co-localization ability each other (Fig. 6A). To confirm previous data, PPI network was examined by STRING database, and numerous proteins involved with PPIL2 (Fig. 6B). To understand in Fig. 6B, each circle of proteins means structure decision status, where large sized circles indicate prediction of protein structure. Most proteins that were expected to have a correlation with PPIL2 co-expression were experimentally determined. Also, PPIL2 showed gene neighborhood relationship except PRCC, PRPF19, SNW1, XAB2, and BVD31. Although most of proteins’ function has not been yet identified, TOP2A and TOP2B were known as DNA topoisomerase 2, controlling of topological states of DNA by transient breakage and subsequent rejoining of DNA strands. Proteins related to PPIL2 showed occurrence profile that have two features: similarity scale and clade coverage. The similarity scale in these presence/absence profile could predict protein interaction. Clade coverage means genome group were separated in the phylogenetic tree and two distinct colors indicate that the lowest and highest similarity observed within the clade. Most of proteins were conserved especially in primates compared with other populations (Fig. 7).
