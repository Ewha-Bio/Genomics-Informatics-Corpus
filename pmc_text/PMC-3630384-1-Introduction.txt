Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most wellstudied diseases in the genomic research area [1, 2]. AML occurs usually in middle-aged people and is diagnosed by increasing leukemic myeloblasts in blood over 30% [3]. AML is a genetically heterogeneous disease, since 1/3 of AML patients have chromosomal rearrangements, like t(8;21) and t(15;17), but other AML patients have normal karyotypes [4]. With recent advances of high-throughput genomic technology, a favorable prognosis has been observed with some genetic changes in cytogenetically normal AML [5]. These results were reflected by the World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria; the NMP1 and CEBPA mutations were included in the 2008 revision of these criteria [6]. The molecular change of AML is considered to be the accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic progenitor cells [7]. Next-generation sequencing technology gave us new insights into the clonal heterogeneity of leukemic mutations so that we can make an explanation why some of these mutations are highly reproducible but others are very rare [8]. Still, in 30% of cytogenetically normal AML, the genetic causality origin or strongly associated genetic changes have not yet been discovered [9, 10].
With advances of high-throughput technology, discovery of disease-associated genes is growing [11]. As a consequence, the genetic knowledge databases are growing rapidly. Accordingly, the annotation of candidate causal genes in genetic studies is a very challenging process for researchers. We propose a workflow of the detection of somatic mutation candidates in 10 normal matched AML samples and introduce concept lattice analysis for clustering the samples that have highly mutated genes in common.
