Active site prediction
Site Map 2.6 (Schr√∂dinger, LLC) was used to predict the active sites in the modeled proteins. The presently modeled human FASN ER domain comprises two subdomains forming the Rossmann fold and substrate binding fold. According to Maier et al. [16], on the porcine ER structure, NADP+ is likely to be found in the junction of the subdomains, and Lys1771 and Asp1797 may be donor residues for substrate protonation. This orientation favors the entry of substrate through a tunnel to the nicotinamide ring and its exit through an opening at the posterior part of the ER domain [16]. This fold orientation was observed in our predicted model of ER (Fig. 7). In the case of the KR domain, the predicted active site had Lys1995 as a central key substrate-interacting residue surrounded by Asn2038, Tyr2034, and Ser2021residues, which also coincides with the observations of Maier et al. [16] on porcine KR.
