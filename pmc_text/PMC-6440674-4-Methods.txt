Filtering out highly variable 200-bp units
Since the details of the dynamics of chromatin state conversions among different cell types was reported it was noted that extensive signal variation exists in regulatory regions [7]. So, we needed a way to quantify signal variation in regulatory regions. Thus, we defined the unit variability count of chromatin states of a given 200-bp unit as the number of states where counts of occurrences were non-zero, to define and compare the observed consistency of each chromatin state at any given genomic position across all 127 epigenomes.
Table 1 shows some randomly chosen highly variable and invariable 200-bp units of the integrated BED file, sorted by chromosome number. The degree of chromatin variability is marked as ‘H’ (high) or ‘L’ (low), as in the last column of the table. According to the table, the chromatin state variability count of unit chr14: 61,114,600‒61,114,800 unit would be eleven, as there were eleven non-zero states (state 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15), and this unit is marked as ‘H,’ or highly variable.
We reasoned that we could use variability count statistics and the maximum likelihood decision rule to make optimal classifications for the Markov model, since uniform priors can be assumed if we only use 200-bp units with low chromatin state variability. In this way, highly variable 200-bp units where different chromatin states were frequently switched to other states across different tissues and cell types could be either eliminated, or used as controls in datasets, in practicing Markov models.
Fig. 2 shows statistical distribution of variability counts across human genomes. Human genomes are dissected into 200-bp units from the original 15,478,458 units. Among them, the variability counts of 1,721,585 units were one, meaning that all 127 cell lines annotated the same state in these 200-bp units. The variability count of chromatin states of 1,808,431 units was two; meaning that all 127 cell lines were annotated as one of two states in these 200-bp units.
Furthermore, if a state with the number of occurrence count fewer than five was discarded in each of the units, the average variability count of chromatin states drops dramatically. Variability counts of less than 3 states accounted for 93.64% (38.59% + 36.87% + 18.18%) of overall 200-bp units. This means that most of these 200-bp units have a strong preference for a certain chromatin state.
Our model should not be based on a single cell line, therefore; it is critical to propose a new functional annotation framework that can be generalized to different cell types. This gave us good heuristic insight to design new Markov models for our study. A generalizable framework can be achieved through statistically-justifiable models. Based on the newly integrated BED file, we assigned a dominant chromatin state for each of the 200-bp unit, as was explained in the previous section. In this way, it was possible to assign just one or two dominant chromatin states for most of the 200bp units of the entire human genome.
