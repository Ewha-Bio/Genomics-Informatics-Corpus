From the epidemiological analysis, we found relevant variables with hepatitis. We confirmed that hepatitis has a wide relation with other diseases. If we make a disease network in which the node is a disease and the edge is a correlation coefficient between two nodes, we can understand the relationship among diseases more clearly. Current known disease networks [10, 11] do not show detailed relationships between hepatitis and other diseases. This is a future research topic.
KARE data are the result of a cohort study. It contains a small number of samples for specific diseases, whereas the whole population is very big. It induces an imbalanced dataset for statistical analysis. Our study implies a basic limitation, even though we tried to complement the problem. We also did not find any significant SNPs related with hepatitis. If we combine the knowledge of other biological databases, we may get a more meaningful interpretation for the results of our experiment.
