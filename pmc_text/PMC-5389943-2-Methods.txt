Public data download
While most researchers are likely to analyze their own data, some users may download public ChIP-Seq data from repositories, such as Short Read Archive (SRA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project data portal. In this paper, we used a dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE29611; the data can be found at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SRP006944), one of the datasets from the ENCODE project [12], which aims to identify all functional elements in the human genome. Among the many samples in GSE29611, we used two samples from HeLa cells (Table 1).
