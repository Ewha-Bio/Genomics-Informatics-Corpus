Selective sweep detected by between-population methods
To detect signals of positive selection in the three pig breeds, two between-population methods (XPEHH and XPCLR) were implemented with phased haplotypes based on pairwise populations of Yorkshire-Landrace (Y-L), Yorkshire-Duroc (Y-D), Landrace-Yorkshire (L-Y), Landrace-Duroc (L-D), Duroc-Yorkshire (D-Y), and Duroc-Landrace (D-L). Here, for Y-L, Yorkshire was regarded as the observed population and Landrace as the reference population. XPEHH and XPCLR scores denote selection that happened in the observed population. As a result, several regions of positive selection were identified at a significance level of p-value < 0.01 [21] in XPEHH, and the top 1,000 genes in XPCLR. Table 2 summarizes the numbers of genes under significant positive selection, which were identified in the six breed pairs (Y-L, Y-D, L-Y, L-D, D-L, and D-Y). For example, for the Y-L breed pair, which detects selection that occurred in the Yorkshire population when compared to the Landrace population, 376 and 1,869 genes were under positive selection based on the XPEHH and XPCLR tests, respectively. For the Y-D breed pair, when using the XPCLR test, 1,498 genes were under positive selection with 3,978 SNPs detected in Yorkshire, with Duroc as the reference population. By the consensus set of genes under positive selection identified with both the XPEHH and XPCLR tests, 26, 7, and 14 genes were identified in Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc, respectively (Fig. 1). For example, the 26 Yorkshire genes identified by both the XPCLR and XPEHH tests in both the Y-L and Y-D comparisons, and so effectively detected four times.
