Patient and control samples
The subjects in this study were selected from a cohort that was part of a community-based prevention and management program of childhood obesity in a rural area of Korea (Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do). Twelve participants, six obese children with a high body mass index and six children with a normal body weight, were randomly selected for this pilot study (Table 1). All individuals were 12â€“13 years old, male and had an East Asian ancestry. Since the subjects of this study were minors, informed consent for all individuals was obtained in written format both from the participants and their parents. This study, including the consent procedure, has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (KIRB-00524-010) at The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine.
