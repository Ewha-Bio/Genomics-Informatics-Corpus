Genomics & Informatics (NLM title abbreviation: Genomics Inform) is the official journal of the Korea Genome Organization. A prototype version of the full-text corpus of Genomics & Informatics, called GNI version 1.0, has been recently archived in the GitHub repository [1, 2]. As of July 2018, 499 Part-of-Speech (POS)-tagged full-text articles are available as a corpus resource. Although there has been valuable work done on annotating abstracts, there are differences between abstracts and full-text articles from a natural language processing (NLP) perspective [3].
Now that a prototype GNI corpus has been constructed, we can obtain basic descriptive statistics, which are statistics that do not seek to test for significance. The most basic statistical measure is a frequency count: a simple tallying of the number of instances of something that occurs in a corpus.
The plot in Fig. 1 was based on a conditional frequency distribution of exemplary keywords—algorithm, alignment, cancer, epigenetics, expression, genome, and patient—where the counts being plotted are the number of times the word occurred in each of the randomly chosen articles from Genomics & Informatics.
