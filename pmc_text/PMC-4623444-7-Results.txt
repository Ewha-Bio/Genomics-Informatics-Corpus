TF discovery based on motif using iRegulon
We tried to discover the regulatory TFs for the insulin-treated gene set using iRegulon in Cytoscape. For each down- and up-regulated gene set, we predicted 25 TFs of the target genes based on motif in upstream 20 kb of the target genes. As shown in Fig. 2, target genes are linked to multiple TFs. A single TF targeted about 138 genes in average.
