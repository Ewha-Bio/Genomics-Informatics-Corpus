Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disease caused by an abnormal proliferation of plasma cells [1]. According to the 2014 Ministry of Health and Welfare Cancer Registration Statistics, MM is the third most common cancer among hematologic malignancies in Korea [2]. Recently, the survival rate has been increasing due to the development of various types of new drugs and the therapeutic options for MM have been characterized by proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib) and thalidomide analogs [3, 4]. However, MM still remains an incurable cancer, since most MM patients eventually develop drug resistance and die from the disease [5].
Despite many advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of MM and the development of promising new therapies, only 25% to 35% of patients respond to treatment [6]. With regard to classification, prognostic determinants are usually associated with baseline clinicopathological features of aggressiveness of the disease, such as high β2 microglobulin and albumin [7, 8]. Besides the clinical classification, risk prediction includes chromosomal abnormalities, such as hyperdiploidy and rearrangements, which are already known to be very important for the prognosis, because such complex chromosomal rearrangements are frequently observed [8, 9].
About 40% of MM cases have chromosomal translocations, including CCND1, CCND3, MAF, MAFB, WHSC1 (also known as MMSET), and FGFR3, which are overexpressed through rearrangements in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus [10]. As the disease progresses, MM cells accumulate additional genetic changes, such as loss of RB1 and TP53 and increased 1q21 and 9q34 [11].
MM is divided into two major categories: hyperdiploid MM (h-MM) and non-hyperdiploid MM. The ploidy categories are stable over time such that patients with h-MM usually remain hyperdiploid over the course of the disease [8, 12].
The term ‘chromothripsis,’ which is the massive but highly localized chromosomal rearrangement in response to a one-step catastrophic event, rather than an accumulation of a series of subsequent and random alterations, has recently emerged [13]. Chromothripsis has been reported in almost all cancer types, with a prevalence of 2% to 3% (with an incidence of ∼25% in bone cancers) [14]. Chromothripsis is associated with the development of high-grade cancers and more aggressive tumors [13, 15].
The causes and consequences of chromothripsis might be exploited by the use of molecularly targeted therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor‒targeted therapy for the treatment of glioblastoma [16]. Chromothripsis affects the functions and expression of a considerable number of genes, and this could be associated with the response to particular drugs [17].
Chromothripsis is defined by the three following major features [18, 19]: (1) localized rearrangements in limited areas of one or several chromosomes, (2) copy number states that suddenly oscillate between areas of normal heterozygosity and loss of heterozygosity, and (3) multiple chromosome fragments rearranged in random orientation and order.
Despite chromothripsis being widely reported in many cancers, the exact criteria and the role of copy number alterations have yet to be standardized [16]. Previous studies have shown a poor prognosis in patients with chromothripsis and that chromothripsis is associated with the prognosis in several cancers, including malignant melanoma, neuroblastoma, and colorectal cancer. These findings suggest that chromothripsis is a tool for predicting the prognosis of patients [20].
The aim of this study is to confirm the association of chromothripsis with drug resistance and the prognosis in patients with MM. Although previous studies have been performed in solid tumors, few studies have examined chromothripsis in MM [14, 20, 21], and we hypothesized that chromothripsis is associated with the prognosis of patients who are diagnosed with MM.
