To date, a considerable number of genetic mutations have been identified that play roles in the tumorigenesis of ATC, mainly by traditional approaches (Table 1) [8-13]. The most well-known mutation of thyroid cancer is BRAFV600E, occurring in approximately 26% of ATCs and 45% of PTCs [8, 14]. The BRAFV600E mutant protein is produced by the point mutation of T1799A coding sequence, and as consequence the BRAF kinase shows constitutive activity [15-18]. Its oncogenic and transforming capability has been well studies [19] and interestingly, it is strongly associated with poor prognosis of PTC, including aggressive pathological characteristics, increased recurrence rates, and failure of treatment [20, 21].
The tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly mutated in ATC [8] but uncommon in well-differentiated PTC and FTC. For example, Donghi et al. [22] reported that p53 was mutated in approximately 71% of undifferentiated thyroid cancers (UDTC). Also Fagin et al. [23] reported 83% mutation rate of p53 in ATCs, and Quiros et al. [24] found 88% of p53 mutation in ATC patients using immunohistochemical analysis.
RAS mutations were detected rarely in PTC, but more prevalently in FTC and ATC [25], as if there are relationship between RAS mutations and the aggressiveness of tumor behavior and/or poor prognosis [26, 27]. From three members of RAS family (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS), codon 12/13 of KRAS mutation is known to be associated with poor survival for more aggressive subtype of thyroid tumors, including ATC [26]. RAS is known as an important regulator of cell growth, differentiation and survival of thyroid cancer [28]. In tumorigenesis, RAS may mediate multiple transduction signaling pathways such as Raf-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways [29].
Mutations of PIK3CA are also common in ATC [8]. PIK3CA encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K and PI3K, in turns, involves in the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, which regulates several cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, adhesion and motility. Especially, this pathway linked to the cell survival, angiogenesis and glucose homeostasis which are important for tumorigenesis [30]. Garcia-Rostan et al. [30] showed that the missense mutations of PIK3CA are higher in ATC than in others such as well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Additionally, ATC patients who had mutated PIK3CA showed also Ras or BRAF alterations.
Garcia-Rostan et al. [31, 32] demonstrated the significant association of mutations in β-catenin and the change of its expression with poor prognosis of ATC. They found that activating mutations of CTNNB1, β-catenin encoding gene, often cause the activation of WNT-β-catenin signaling. In general, as an ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein, β-catenin is a downstream signaling molecule in Wnt pathway, and known to have a crucial role in cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin. Interestingly, when it is upregulated, the nuclear translocation is occurred so that the transcription of various tumor-promoting genes could be triggered. Axin 1 is a scaffold protein and located in chromosome 16p13.3. It is supposed to be a tumor suppressor and play a role also in the Wnt pathway. Kurihara et al. [33] found the mutation of Axin 1 in 81.8% of 22 Japanese ATC samples. Together, the genetic alterations of genes in the Wnt signaling pathway are found frequently with ATC suggesting the important role of Wnt pathway for ATC tumorigenesis.
Although the mutation prevalence is not high, mutations in the gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been recently identified in ATC [9, 34]. The overall prevalence of mutations of IDH1 was reported as 11% in 18 ATC samples by Murugan et al. [9]. Murugan and Xing [10] reported two novel point mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, C3592T and G3602A, with a prevalence of 25% in 8 ATC tumor samples. ALK, one of the receptor tyrosine kinases, is a member of insulin receptor subfamily and these transverse point mutations caused the amino acid changes L1198F and G1201E, followed by increase of tyrosine kinase activities. Initially, ALK was identified as an oncogeneic fusion gene NPM1-ALK in anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma [35]. Further, fusion gene EML4-ALK was found in non-small-cell lung cancer [36] and TMP3/4-ALK and RANBP2-ALK in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors [37]. They were aberrantly activated and promoted cell proliferation and survival [38, 39].
Although these mutations have been reported to date, it is not clear what of those are the driver mutations of ATC development or if there is any. Also, many other mutations and genes might be associated with ATC tumorigenesis, which may contribute a lot to the diagnosis and treatment of ATC. Therefore, it is a natural consequence that scientists try to adapt genomic approaches to analyze the mechanism of ATC in very recent years.
