HLA association test between the two cohorts
Finally, we tested the HLA difference between the two cohorts using logistic regression. Similar to the genome-wide analysis above, we included the top 20 PCs as covariates to account for regional differences among the samples. Again, we set one cohort as cases (58C) and the other cohort as controls (UKBS). We then performed association tests to identify associations between markers in the MHC region (including both the imputed binary markers and the genotyped SNPs) and the cohort identifier. Fig. 5A shows the Manhattan plot of associations. We did not find any binary marker that exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance of 5.7 × 10-7 (red line), which was the threshold used in the WTCCC study. Fig. 5B demonstrates that the association tests did not show inflation (λ = 0.92 for all markers and λ = 0.93 for markers with a frequency ≥ 0.05). Overall, both the Manhattan plot and the Q-Q plot showed that there was no significant difference in HLA between the two control cohorts, emphasizing that the two control cohorts can be used as a single combined control for HLA analyses.
