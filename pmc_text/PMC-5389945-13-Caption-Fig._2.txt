Detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) used for determining sex (AMEL-1), an autosomal SNP for human identification (rs28-28793), and a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) SNP (mtDNA_3010) using digital polymerase chain reaction in plasma and urine cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid samples. Samples were isolated from a patient with acute tubular necrosis 18 days after receiving a kidney transplant. In this patient (patient 24), an unrelated male donor's organ was transplanted into a female recipient.
