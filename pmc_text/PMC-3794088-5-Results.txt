A total of 747,076 SNP genotype assays were tested on the DNA samples of 484 Korean childhood subjects. ALT and AST levels of the subjects according to age and sex are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the p-values for the association between genotype distributions and levels of ALT and AST. Manhattan plots of association analyses of all SNPs with respect to ALT and AST are presented with the chromosomal positions (X-axis) and negative logarithm of p-values (Y-axis) of each SNP (Fig. 1). Quantile-quantile plots comparing the association p-values with those expected for a null distribution are also presented (Fig. 2). The highest-ranked SNPs showing the lowest p-values (p < 1.0 × 10-5) of association with ALT and AST levels are listed in Table 1. In addition, genotype clusters of the SNPs are presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Although there was no SNP satisfying the criteria of genome-wide significance (p < 1.0 × 10-8), we identified three loci (rs4949718, rs80311637, and rs596406 in ST6GALNAC3, ADAMTS9, and CELF2, respectively) that were suggestively associated with levels of ALT and AST. Of these SNPs, rs4949718 was found to be more strongly associated with ALT levels (p = 1.87 × 10-7) but less in AST levels (p = 1.49 × 10-6). The missense rs80311637 (V1597M) and intronic rs596406 SNPs were more strongly associated with an increased risk of AST than ALT.
