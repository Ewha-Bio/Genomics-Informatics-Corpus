Tear, saliva, and serum
Biomarkers
A review article on biomarkers in pSjS by Chen et al. [44] emphasizes the importance of bodily fluids such as saliva, tear, and serum as ideal sources for biomarker studies. According to the review, a number of putative saliva biomarkers have been identified by quantitative proteomics, and the combined studies such as salivary proteomics and miRNA screening may improve the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers for disease. The biomarkers identified in bodily fluids for pSjS, which is summarized in the review by Chen et al. [44], include but are not limited to: profilin and anhydrase I in saliva [45], IL-4 and IL-5 in saliva [46], Cathepsin S in tear [47], Myxovirus-resistance protein A (MxA) in whole blood [48], Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L) in serum [49], and CXCL13 in serum and saliva [50].
It is well accepted that IFN type I signature in PBMC and the salivary glands serves as a valuable pSjS biomarker [51]. MxA level in monocytes and in whole blood has been correlated with IFN score and pSjS disease activity [48]. The level of MxA was reportedly reduced after treatment with hydroxychloroquine, which also supports the potentially important role of MxA as a disease biomarker [48]. Utilization of the enzyme immunoassay in the cited study suggested MxA <100 μg/L as low, and MxA >100 μg/L as high [48].
Flt-3L in serum might be associated with lymphoma development in SjS [49]. An interesting study by Tobon et al. [49] reported that the levels of Flt-3L were associated with previously-identified risk factors for lymphoma development, such as presence of purpura, lymphocytopenia, lower levels of C4 and IgM, higher levels of beta2 -microglobulin, and a higher disease activity score. Also, pSjS patients who had a history of lymphoma showed higher levels of Flt-3L. Moreover, the Flt-3L levels were increased in the serum up to about 8 years before the diagnosis of lymphoma. This study has suggested an ideal cutoff value of Flt-3L (175 pg/ml) for an association with lymphoma in patients with pSjS (44% for sensitivity, 97.5% for specificity, and 97% for negative predictive value).
Exosome
Exosomes are small membrane-bound macrovesicles (30–100 nm in size) secreted from various types of cells [52]. They resemble flattened spheres under the electron microscope [53, 54]. Exosomes are known to have a number of biological functions, such as intracellular communication, signal transduction, transport of genetic materials, and modulation of immune responses [54]. They can be found in various bodily fluids such as plasma, serum, breast milk, saliva, and urine [55]. Recent studies have reported miRNAs for SjS biomarkers in these fluids. It has been controversial whether miRNAs detected in many of those body fluids are circulating freely or are concentrated in exosomes [56].
To compare miRNA expression in the exosome pellet and the exosome-depleted fraction of serum and saliva, Gallo et al. [17] measured miRNA expression by qRT-PCR. The study examined miRNAs previously reported to be freely circulating or miRNAs known to be exosome-specific. The concentration of miRNAs was consistently higher in the exosome-pellet compared to the exosome-depleted supernatant. Selected miRNAs that are known to be detectable in exosomes were undetectable in whole serum and the exosome-depleted supernatant. Therefore, the study concluded that miRNAs are primarily present in exosomes. However, the authors found their data inconsistent with two other previously published studies; one indicating that miRNAs were predominantly found in exosome-free cell culture media [57], and another showing that miRNAs were bound to Argonaut-2 protein in plasma and serum [58]. The authors speculated that the discrepancy could be, in part, due to minor differences in purifying exosomes or differences between plasma and serum. The study emphasizes the utilization of exosomal miRNA for early biomarker studies to reduce false-negative results when detecting low abundance miRNAs and the importance of optimized exosome purification process.
