Clinical samples
CAD was confirmed by coronary angiography. The samples were composed of 20 CAD patients and 20 control individuals from Imam Khomeini Hospital of Ahvaz from 2016 to 2017 and sampleâ€™s characteristics are provided in Table 1. The informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The severity of coronary artery narrowing estimated by quantitative coronary angiography to avoid inter-observer and intera-observer variability and stenosis greater than 50% luminal diameter considered as significant CAD. On the other side control group have chosen from persons with completely normal coronary artery angiogram without obvious plaque or narrowing. Coronary artery calcification grade 2 (easily recognized) and 3 (recognized in more than half of one coronary artery) were included and grade 1 calcification (difficult to recognize) excluded to avoid controversy. None of the patients had grade 4 calcification. The process of the study was approved by Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz, Iran.
