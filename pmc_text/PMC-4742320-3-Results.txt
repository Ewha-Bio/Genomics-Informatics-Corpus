Indirect roles of introns
Different ordinal position of introns within the gene has a different functional role
The first intron among all introns within a gene has particularly been a research focus. The first intron is the longest among all other downstream introns within a gene in most species including plants and animals [38]. Additionally, certain transcription factor binding motifs are enriched in first introns [61]. Different parts of genes have different average sizes of introns, e.g., the size of introns in the 5' UTRs are twice as large as introns in coding regions [62]. In Drosophila, long introns evolve more slowly than shorter ones and first introns are the longest compared to other introns [3763]. In Tetrahymena, the introns located closer to the 5' end of genes are more conserved than downstream introns. Our team also proved in a previous study that first introns are the longest and the most conserved [39] compared to other downstream introns. Furthermore, we showed that active histone marks, such as H3K4me1, and H3K4me3, are significantly enriched in the first introns, and the size of the first intron of a gene becomes bigger as the number of exons that gene carries increases. Additionally, we showed in the same paper that the proportions of regulatory histone marks are positively associated with the levels of gene expressions in 12 normal human tissues including kidney, heart, liver, and ovary [39].
Additionally, a replacement of the second intron with other introns in the beta-globin gene in human led to a reduction of the efficiency of 3'-end formation [64]. Introns, particularly first introns, have important roles in the correct cytoplasmic localization of some mRNAs, including the Drosophila oskar gene and mRNA export [6065] as well as in transcriptional and translational regulation [616667].
Taken together, first introns among all introns within genes have special functional characteristics, indicating that the existence of introns within genes is highly unlikely to be the product of a random process.
Introns length matters in the efficiency of natural selection
According to Comeron et al. [41], long introns are favored because they increase the efficiency of natural selection by releasing The Hill-Robertson (HR) interference. The HR interference was basically described as genetic linkage between two sites under selection in finite populations, leading to decreasing effectiveness of natural selection [41]. The HR interference model predicts that selection efficiency should be different between genes that differ in exon-intron structures, so that genes with longer introns should be under weaker HR interference by increasing recombination between two sites in two neighboring exons. In other words, introns may have a role in relaxing intragenic HR interference between sites under the influence of natural selection in finite populations. Recombination gives the opportunity for two independently occurring favorable alleles at linked loci to be located together and thus enhances the efficiency of natural selection [40], which can be one of the plausible scenarios of how introns have been sustained through the evolutionary history of genes.
Introns can provide a source of new genes
Recently, Carvunis et al. [42] suggested a very interesting hypothesis about how novel genes arise from non-functional translated ORFs, named proto-genes, by showing that hundreds of short ORFs of proto-genes located in non-genic sequences were actually translated and might provide adaptive potential to cells in different physiological environments in Ascomycota phylogeny, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. According to their model, the short ORFs can evolve into real functional genes through a kind of continuous evolutionary process. In that sense, long non-coding intron regions in higher eukaryotes can be a good reservoir of short and non-functional ORFs.
Trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are enriched in introns
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a popular approach to identify trait associated genetic variants so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GWASs compare the allele frequencies of case groups (i.e., disease groups) and control groups (i.e., normal groups) of study participants to identify the SNPs that are significantly more enriched in case groups than control groups. If an allele is significantly more frequent in case groups, the allele is said to be a disease-associated allele, or a trait-associated SNP (TAS). In theory, TASs are considered to reside near sites of actual disease-causing mutations in genomes. Interestingly, most of the TASs detected by GWASs have been mapped to intron regions rather than exonic or nonsysnonymous sites (Fig. 1A) [4368]. The statistical significance of this finding was proven by a comparison of the proportion of intronic SNPs mapped by all SNPs obtained from 'v dbSNP 142' after subtracting the TASs (i.e., all SNPs minus TASs) and the proportion of intronic TASs (p<0.01) (Fig. 1B). Investigation of the functional implication of these intron-TASs will thus be an important research subject in the future.
Introns harbor several kinds of noncoding functional RNA genes
Recent studies based on massively parallel sequencing techniques have contributed to identifying various types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in genomes including miRNAs, siRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and they are known to be preferentially located in the intron regions within genes [46]. For instance, about half of the miRNAs in the human genome are located in introns, and they are usually co-expressed with their host genes regulated by the promoters of host genes [44]. Similar to miRNAs, some snoRNAs reside in introns, and they are also regulated by host transcriptional and splicing machineries [45]. Other ncRNAs, including lncRNAs and siRNAs, are also found in intron regions, though the proportion of lncRNAs and siRNAs in introns is lower than that of miRNAs and snoRNAs in introns [246]. Introns are classically degraded after the completion of splicing; however, these ncRNA genes embedded in intron regions are produced upon intron removal [246]. Furthermore, they can survive even longer than the intronic host genes [2]. Considering that the ncRNAs located in introns are co-expressed and co-regulated with their host genes by the promoters and splicing machineries of host genes, they are considered to be involved in auto-regulation of the expression of host genes [46].
