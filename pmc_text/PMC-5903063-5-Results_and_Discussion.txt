The number of SNPs used for imputation for the eight MS markers ranged from 9 to 24 (average 15) for BovineSNP50 and 151 to 296 for BovineHD (average 232). The number of alleles for MS markers ranged between 7 for BM1824 to 24 for TGLA227. The effective number of MS alleles varied from 3.4 in BM1824 to 8.0 in TGLA53. The observed heterozygosity varied from 0.7 in BM1824 to 1.0 in TGLA53 (Table 2).
With BovineSNP50, the highest accuracy of 50% was recorded for TGLA122 and TGLA227 while with BovineHD most of the markers had an accuracy of 50%. The minimum imputation accuracy of 1% was observed for TGLA53 with both the SNP chip panels. TGLA53 had ~40% missing genotypes which could have attributed to the reduction in average accuracy. The genotype concordance rate averaged over all the loci was 40% for the BovineSNP50 whereas it was 43% for BovineHD (Table 1).
The accuracy was limited by marker TGLA53. Accuracy increased to ~50% with BovineHD if TGLA53 marker was removed from the analysis. The allelic concordance of 30% and 43% with BovineSNP50 and BovineHD respectively was seen in the validation samples. The average correlation between the predicted and true genotypes was 31% and 15%, respectively with BovineSNP50 and BovineHD, respectively. Highest correlation was seen for TGLA227 and lowest in TGLA53 with BovineSNP50. With BovineHD highest correlation was seen for BM1824 and lowest for TGLA53. Accuracy of imputation is known to increase with the increase in reference population size and also by including the familial genotype data in the reference population. Also including the genotypes from the related individuals in the reference population allows the Beagle program to infer haplotypes correctly and thus make better predictions for the ungenotyped marker.
Marker density is known to affect the accuracy of imputation. Higher imputation accuracy with increased marker density has been shown by Hayes et al. [12]. While we did observe an increase in accuracy with the HD SNP panel, however it was not high enough to be used in routine practice. McClure et al. [2] observed higher accuracies as compared to our study. They used the validation animals which were derived from the reference population whereas we lacked such design in our samples. Also, no significant increase was observed in number of genotypes imputed correctly with the increase in number of iterations (Table 3).
For the reference population to predict the MS alleles with higher accuracies we need multiple generations of ancestors genotypes along with the pedigree information. For imputing MS markers from SNP data we suggest using related animals. Such studies need to be optimized well before they could be used in routine practice.
