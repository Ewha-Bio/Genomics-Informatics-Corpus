Impact Codon
Das et al. [32] quantified the degree of codon bias by assigning an impact score (dxyzi) to each codon of a gene sequence, since it considers codon usage as well as the base compositional bias. Impact score is defined as dxyzi=fxyzf1(x)f2(y)f3(z), where fxyz is the normalized codon frequency for the codon xyz and fn(m) is the normalized frequency of base m at codon position n in a gene. If X̄ and µ denote the sample mean and population mean of the impact score for a particular codon respectively; and σ the population standard deviation, then z score of a test statistics is given by z=X--µσ/N, where N is the total no of codons. The impact codons are then identified, based on the level of significance from the z score of test statistic. The scores of the impact codons differ markedly from the results expected in the absence of codon bias and it seems reasonable to assume that RCB in the highly expressed genes is strongly influenced by the presence of impact codons.
