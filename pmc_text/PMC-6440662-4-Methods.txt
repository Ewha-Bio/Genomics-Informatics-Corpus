Phase II
Physicochemical characterization
Theoretical physiochemical parameters such as molecular weight, isoelectric point, aliphatic index, instability index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) of these HPs were analyzed using ProtParam server of the Expasy tools (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/). Results of this analysis have been listed in Supplementary Table 2.
Determination of sub-cellular localization
For the identification of a protein as a drug or vaccine candidate, determination of the sub-cellular localization of the protein becomes particularly important. Surface membrane protein can be served as a potential vaccine target while cytoplasmic proteins may act as promising drug targets [32]. We used CELLO [33], PSORTb [34], and PSLpred [35] for the denotation of sub-cellular localization of the query proteins. TMHMM, SOSUI, and HMMTOP were applied for the prediction of query proteins for being a membrane protein, based on Hidden Markov Model [36â€“38]. SingnalP 4.1 [39] was used to predict the signal peptide and SecretomeP 2.0 [40] were utilized for the identification of proteins involved in non-classical secretory pathway. Results of these predictions are summarized in Supplementary Table 3.
Functional prediction of the query proteins
Various tools were used for precise functional assignments of all 39 HPs from S. flexneri (described in Table 1) such as CDD-Blast, Pfam, HmmScan, SMART, Scanprosite, MOTIF [41], INTERPROSCAN [42], CATH [43], SUPERFAMILY [44], and Protonet [45]. Results of these analyses have been outlined in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5.
The computational prediction of the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequences greatly facilitates the subsequent prediction of its function [46]. An online server PS2-v2 (PS Square version 2) [47], a template based method were used to predict the structure of the HPs. The modeling of proteins using this online server further substantiated the function of HPs. Besides, PFP-FunDSeqE [48] has been used to elucidate the protein fold patterns based on a combination of functional domain information and evolutionary information (Table 2).
Virulence factors analysis
Virulence factors (VFs) are described as potent targets for developing drugs because it is essential for the severity of infection [49]. VICMpred [50] and Virulentpred [51] tools were employed to predict VFs from protein sequences with an accuracy of 70.75% and 81.8%, respectively.
Functional protein association networks
The function and activity of a protein are often modulated by other proteins with which it interacts. Therefore, understanding of protein-protein interactions serve as valuable leads for predicting the function of a protein. In this investigation, we had employed STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, https://string-db.org/) [52] to predict protein interactions partners of HPs. To predict functional association, only highest confidence score partner proteins were chosen in this study.
