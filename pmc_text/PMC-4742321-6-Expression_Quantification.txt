Numerous methods have been developed for expression quantification using RNA-seq data. The methods are grouped into two according to the target levels: gene- and isoform-level quantification. Alternative expression analysis by sequencing (ALEXA-seq) [32], enhanced read analysis of gene expression (ERANGE) [33], and normalization by expected uniquely mappable area (NEUMA) [34] support gene-level quantification. Isoform-level quantification methods are divided into three groups according to the reference type and requirement of alignment results. The first group (e.g., RSEM [35]) requires the alignment result of reads using the transcriptome as a reference. The second group (e.g., Cufflinks [24] and StringTie [26]) also requires alignment results of reads using whole genome sequences as a reference rather than the transcriptome. The last group (e.g., Sailfish [36]) uses an alignment-free method. We discuss each isoform-level quantification method in detail in the following sections.
