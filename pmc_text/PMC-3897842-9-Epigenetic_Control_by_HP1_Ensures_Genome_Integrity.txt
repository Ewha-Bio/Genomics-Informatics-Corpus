HP1 subcode: above the histone code
Recently, the "HP1 subcode" hypothesis is emerging in addition to the genetic code and histone code: a hypothesis that the transcription of genetic information encoded in DNA-i.e., genetic code-is regulated in part by histone variants, modifications, and nucleosome occupancy. The histone code hypothesis states that the type and combination of histone modifications are interpreted by the cell as instructions for organizing gene expression and constitutes the most advanced conceptual framework for deciphering the genetic information cascades that regulate gene expression. Further, a combination of HP1 paralogs and modifications may be defined as a second regulatory layer of the code-that is, a subcode-involved in transcription, especially gene silencing, within the general context of the histone code. The HP1 subcode can be secondary-level information residing above the genetic and histone codes and regulate HP1 interactions with other key proteins, further modulating gene silencing and possibly replication, recombination, and DNA repair. In this review, we will discuss the interplay between genetics and epigenetics in cancer through HP1.
