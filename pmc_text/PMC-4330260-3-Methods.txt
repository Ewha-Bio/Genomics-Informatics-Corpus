Phenotypes and quantitative traits
Past diabetes history was obtained through structured questionnaires by interviewers. Anthropometric measurements, including weight and height, were also obtained, and BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m2) [2]. Biochemical assessments were performed, including fasting serum glucose, 2-h 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, and fasting serum insulin (FSI). A total of 3,028 subjects with prevalent hyperglycemia (fasting glucose ≥ 110, 2-h glucose level after 75 g oral glucose challenge ≥ 140), or self-reported diabetes history were excluded. Of the 8,842 individuals who were examined in the previous genomewide association study [7], 5,814 nondiabetic individuals were selected.
