In the KARE dataset, there were substantial overlaps between the cases of DM, HT, and CAD (Fig. 1). We found that the occurrence of one disease was largely dependent on another. For example, the incidence of HT was significantly associated with CAD (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64 to 3.48; p = 4.29e-06). Similarly, the odds ratio of incident DM for HT versus normal was 2.15 (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.56; p = 2.20e-16), and the odds ratio of CAD for DM was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.68; p = 2.82e-02) (Fig. 2).
We analyzed all pairwise interaction effects from the KARE data using GBOOST. As the result, we detected 1,962, 2,023, and 1,709 epistatic interactions in DM, HT, and CAD, respectively (Table 3). For a full list, see the Supplementary Tables 1,2,3. We overlapped these epistatic SNPs within genomic regions, including the promoter, gene distal region, intron, and exon. (Fig. 2). As a result, the majority of detected epistatic SNPs was found to reside in non-coding regions, especially within introns and gene distal regions, which are intergenic regions, excluding promoters.
Furthermore, we tested whether the epistatic SNPs were enriched in regulatory element, such as enhancers and DNase I footprints (Fig. 3). We identified statistically significant enrichment of the SNPs in enhancer regions (p = 0.001), as well as DNase I footprint regions (p < 0.001). This suggests that the disruption of regulatory factor binding might be involved in the disease mechanism. For that reason, we annotated epistatic SNPs using regulatory element information, including promoters, as well as enhancers (see Methods). We also proved that the assigned genes were enriched in each known disease-associated gene set (Table 3).
We built a knowledge-based epistatic network. We discovered that the diseases share many associated genes and also have a number of epistatic interactions within and between genes involved in each disease (Fig. 4). For a detailed list, see the Supplementary Table 4.
For example, we detected an epistatic interaction effect between atypical protein kinase C isotype-specific interacting protein (ASIP) and hexokinase II (HK2) in DM. Previous studies have reported that overexpression of ASIP inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake [13], and HK2 plays a central role in glucose metabolism [14]. Our result implies that gene pairs, such as ASIP and HK2, could boost the incidence of DM through epistatic interactions. We also detected several significant epistatic interaction effects in CAD and HT between several DM-associated gene pairs. This finding could provide a genetic basis for the increased prevalence of CAD and HT in diabetic patients.
