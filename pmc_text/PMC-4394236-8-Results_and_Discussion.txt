Target-template alignment
The amino acid sequences of the human FASN ER and KR domains were retrieved from Uniprot (P49327). Comparative modeling method was implemented to predict the structures of the ER and KR domains. The structural templates for modeling the query sequences were searched against PDB using BLASTP. Many of the hits obtained were similar to the query sequences, mainly representing the reductase families. The best templates were selected in accordance with the optimal pairwise alignment, sequence coverage, and sequence conservation. Accordingly, mammalian (porcine, Sus scrofa) fatty acid synthase (chain A) (PDB ID: 2VZ8, 3.2 Ã… resolution, region 1635 to 1860, 82% similarity) was chosen for ER. Similarly, the template chosen for the KR domain (porcine, Sus scrofa) showed significant homology (83% of sequence identity matching to region 1866 to 2117 of 2VZ8) and was used for modeling the KR domain.
