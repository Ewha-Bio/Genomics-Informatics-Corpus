Frequency of copy number alterations in MM cell lines
We analyzed the frequency of copy number alterations (CNAs), including mosaicism in 9 MM cell lines. Among them, chrs 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and X were the sites with the most frequent CNAs in the MM cell lines (Fig. 1A). Among the MM cell lines, the frequency of CNAs (66.67% to 95.83%, median: 83.33%) in MM.1S and KMS-12-PE cells was relatively low (16/24 chromosomes), and the frequency of CNAs in U266 and RPMI8226 cells was high (23/24). U266 cells showed fewer CNAs, but alterations were observed in almost all chromosomes except one.
The chromosomes were divided into arms to confirm the trend of CNAs. According to the algorithm, if the copy number was 2.5 or more, it was considered an amplification, and if the copy number was 1.5 or less, it was considered a loss. Analysis of the tendency of CNAs showed that more CNAs were observed in the q arm than in the p arm (Fig. 1B and 1C).
To identify the chromothripsis-like pattern in MM cell lines, the copy number oscillation state was identified. If there were more than 10 breakpoints in a single chromosome, it was considered a chromothripsis-like pattern [14, 22]. The chromosome where the chromothripsis-like pattern was most frequently observed was chr 1 in 5 cell lines, followed by chrs 11 and 12 in three cell lines. On the other hand, chrs 4 and 14 showed fewer chromothripsis-like patterns. Of the cell lines, KMS-11 cells most frequently had a chromothripsis-like pattern (5/24 chromosomes), followed by RPMI8226 (4/24 chromosomes).
The chromosome arms were analyzed to confirm the trend of the chromothripsis-like pattern. As a result of the analysis, breakpoints were observed more than twice as often in the q arm than in the p arm (p: 209 breakpoints, q: 502 breakpoints) (Table 1). Breakpoints were also most frequently observed in chr 1.
