Identification of differentially expressed proteins
The biomarkers should reflect the alteration of disease-related pathophysiological processes in the patient samples, compared to controls. Thus, the DEPs between control and patient samples are identified as the biomarker candidates (identification of DEPs) (Fig. 1). A number of statistical methods have been developed for identification of the DEPs, such as t-test [34] or integrative statistical methods [3536], with the multiple comparison correction. These methods compare the relative protein abundances between control and patient samples and then estimate the significance (p-value or FDR) of the difference in the relative protein abundances between control and patient samples methods. The proteins with p-value or FDR < 0.01 or 0.05 are then selected as the DEPs. Furthermore, additional constraints are used to select more reliable DEPs. For example, for each DEP, the number of the patients showing the fold-changes larger than a cutoff (1.5- or 2-fold) is counted, and a subset of DEPs with the number of patients larger than a certain percentage (50% of the patients) can be selected as the reliable DEPs [37]. Using this criterion, we can focus on the DEPs that are likely to show their alterations in the abundance in at least more than half of the patients when they were used as biomarker candidates for newly collected patient samples.
