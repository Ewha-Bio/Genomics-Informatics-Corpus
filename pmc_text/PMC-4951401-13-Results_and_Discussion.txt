RMSF, Rg, and intermolecular bond stability as a measure of shortlisting potential leads targeting AMA1
The RMSF graph inferred NSC95522 and NSC179676 to exhibit the least fluctuation of <1 Å at the critical hotspot residues (Tyr230, Tyr213, Tyr15, and Tyr110) in comparison to the apo form, indicating a gain of backbone rigidity. As discussed earlier, flexibility of these residues is crucial for homing RON2. However, the other two compounds did not show this impact (Fig. 3A and 3B). Moreover, the Rg for both apo and all 4 holo forms was found to be within an admissible deviation of <1 Å. NSC95522 and NSC179676 showed the lowest Rg deviation of 0.44 Å and 0.53 Å, while the apo form showed 0.57 Å; thus, this reinforces that these two compounds confer backbone rigidity and compactness, which strongly preclude RON2 binding (Fig. 3C). Secondary structure element (SSE) perturbations were also analyzed in a similar way as discussed above. This inferred no major dynamism in the SSE during the entire production run; it also corroborated with the fewest changes observed in the intra-molecular hydrogen bonds formed for the apo and all other 4 holo forms (Fig. 3D). For all four of these compounds, the stability of protein-ligand contacts during the production run was analyzed and visualized as a 2D interaction map (Fig. 4A–D). This inferred π-cation interactions to be unanimously stable for all four compounds. Recent studies propose that ligands exhibiting π-cation interactions with Phe, Tyr, and Trp of the receptor highly influence the conformational stability of the proteins, as they are strong non-covalent electrostatic interactions [3435]. A holistic and stringent comparative analysis was performed over the 4 holo forms against the apo form, which strongly reinforces that AMA1-NSC95522 and AMA1-NSC179676 are stable complexes. Moreover, both these compounds exhibit prominent π-cation interactions with the proven hotspot residues Tyr213, Tyr230, Tyr110, and Tyr215 of AMA1 for ~80% of the entire production run, implying that these compounds are potential blockers of conformational changes of AMA1, which facilitates the binding of RON2 [35]. The MMGBSA scores of the AMA1-NSC95522 and AMA1-NSC179676 complexes were found to be -79 kcal/mol and -59 kcal/mol respectively, also ensuring significant binding and stable complex formation [20].
In conclusion, NSC95522 and NSC179676 shall be considered the most potential leads, with both showing significant binding free energies with strong intermolecular interactions to hydrophobic cleft residues. Moreover, these compounds were also found to limit the torsion angle of the AMA1 tilt of 90°, while the other two compounds showed a wide range of deviation (~90° to 180°). Hence, all of these inferences strongly suggest that NSC95522 and NSC179676, with antiprotozoal and ophthalmic activity, shall prove to be highly efficient leads for targeting AMA1-RON2 interactions (Fig. 4E), thereby combating toxoplasmosis. However, further experimental validation is required to study the efficacy of these molecules.
