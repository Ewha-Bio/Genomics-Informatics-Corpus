The application of Exome-Seq and Whole Genome-Seq profiled a mutational spectrum in various cancers [5-8]. The RNA-Seq could profile not only the gene expressions but also new parameters such as allelic expression, alternative splicing [9, 10], RNA-editing [11], and alternative polyadenylation of 3'-untranaslated region (3'-UTR) [12, 13]. Structural variations such as gene-fusions, e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG in prostate cancer [14] and KIF5B-RET in lung cancer [15] have been identified from the analysis of NGS data. Moreover, the patterns of genome rearrangements can be analyzed systematically. For example, a novel pattern of genomic rearrangement such as fold-back inversion could be found by simply examining the short read alignment of NGS data [16]. A novel mechanism of cancer genome rearrangement i.e., chromothripsis has been proposed, which represent a catastrophic event of fragmentation and reassembly of a single chromosome [17]. In addition, high-resolution epigenomic profiles of cancer genome could be obtained by applying NGS to chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). For example, a recent study of the genome-wide DNA methylation profile showed novel patterns in which the majority of DNA methylation changes occurs at CpG island shores neighboring the regions up to 2 Kb from CpG islands, and revealed the patterns of cancer-specific and tissue-specific DNA methylation [18, 19]. Aberrant histone modification was also found in cancers showing an association with the patient's prognosis [20]. These studies support the pivotal role of epigenetic regulation in cancer development and progression. Moving forward, new applications such as genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) [21] and translocation capture sequencing (TC-Seq) [22] have recently been proposed, which could profile the genome-wide translocation hotspots.Notably, the advantage of NGS is not restricted to these applications. It serves a platform for the identification of novel RNAs or DNAs. For example, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from intergenic and intronic regions have been identified in prostate cancers i.e., prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) [23]. A novel class of DNA i.e., extrachromosomal microDNA, has been recently found by NGS technology, which is derived from unique non-repetitive sequence enriched in 5'-UTR, exons, and CpG islands [24]. The role of microDNA in cancer will be the next question.
