Differences in DNA methylation and gene expression patterns between obese and normal individuals
We first investigated whether gene expression levels and/or DNA methylation profiles can distinguish obese individuals from control individuals with normal body weights (n = 6 in each group). To this end, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses using gene expression profiles. No clear segregation was observed between the obese and control individuals using the gene expression profiles (Fig. 1A). In contrast to gene expression, hierarchical clustering using DNA methylation profiling revealed a unique cluster of obese individuals that was segregated from the controls (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the obese individuals may harbor characteristic epigenetic marks in their blood cells. We next investigated the global distribution of DNA methylation levels of all CpG sites examined across the 12 individuals. The distribution of beta-values (Fig. 1C) showed a bimodal distribution whose two peaks correspond to the hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG sites. After transforming the beta-values to M-values (Fig. 1D), we divided the DNA methylation sites into hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG sites using the Gaussian mixture model. Boxplots of M-values corresponding to hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG sites are shown for each sample in Fig. 1E and 1F, respectively. Of note, when sorted by median value, a clear segregation of obese individuals from controls was observed in both profiles. M-values representing hypomethylated CpG sites skewed higher for obese individuals compared with controls, and the resulting shift in median values was responsible for the segregation of obese and control individuals (p ≈ 0.0 for all normal vs. all obese; one-tailed t test) (Fig. 1E). In addition, the hypermethylated CpG sites of obese individuals tended to have lower M-values compared to controls (p ≈ 0.0 for all obese vs. all normal; one-tailed t test) (Fig. 1F). The overall M-value distribution between obese and control individuals suggests that the difference in methylation between two groups may be subtle, but our analyses revealed the CpG sites in obese individuals may have less frequent hypomethylation and hypermethylation compared to controls.
