Metagenomics is defined as the study of the metagenome, which is total genomic DNA from environmental samples. Metagenomics has long been one of the major research tools in microbial ecology since the term was first used in 1998 [1]. Metagenomic information allows for a more in-depth understanding of the ecological role, metabolism, and evolutionary history of microbes in a given ecosystem by analyzing environmental DNA directly without prior cultivation. Metagenomics has made unprecedented contributions to microbial ecology; among them, one of the most outstanding discoveries of metagenomics is the first description of proteorhodopsin in marine bacteria [2]. Moreover, many hypotheses and questions in ecology and evolutionary biology have been tested and answered through metagenomic research. For example, Fuhrman et al. [3] tested a latitudinal gradient of biodiversity, which is one of the most widely recognized patterns in macroscopic taxa, on marine bacteria, and more recently, the taxonomic and functional distinction of bacteria in desert compared to other nondesert biomes was investigated through cross biome comparison using shotgun metagenomics [4]. Varied definitions converge into two main categories, targeted metagenomics and shotgun metagenomics, depending on their purpose and target materials. This review offers an overview of the tools and databases that are widely used in both targeted and shotgun metagenomics, in particular emphasizing on metagenome sequences generated by recent next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.
