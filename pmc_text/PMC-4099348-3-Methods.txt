Design and oligonucleotides
The list of the entire exons for the 30 genes was obtained from a consensus coding sequence database, CCDS (build 36.3), showing a total number of 701 exons covering 102 kb, according to hg18 (March, 2006 assembly).
Targeted restriction fragments were selected using Disperse software [11]. Templates for circularization of each chosen targeted fragment (selector probes) were designed using ProbeMaker software [12]. Each selector probe consisted of two sequences of 20-25 nucleotides complementary to the ends of its targeted restriction fragment.
The 3'-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) were prepared by incubating the oligonucleotides with 1× Tdt buffer (NEB), 1× CoCl2 (NEB), 0.1 mM dUTP-biotin (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and 0.2 units/µL terminal transferase (NEB) in a final volume of 50 µL. The reaction was incubated at 37℃ for 1 h and followed by enzyme inactivation at 75℃ for 20 min.
