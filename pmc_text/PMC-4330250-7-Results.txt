Phasing short reads
We downloaded whole-genome paired-end NGS data of seven samples from the TIARA database to discover haplotypes with the SNPs associated with BMI within the 53 LD blocks from the GWA analysis. We mapped the short reads to the human reference genome (hg19), and those reads with bad mapping quality (mapping quality <5) were filtered out. The average mapping rate was about 93%. We separated the mapped reads into the 53 LD blocks for each of seven individuals (Table 1). Each group of separated reads was called for variants, and the heterozygous SNPs were phased using the phase function in Samtools. Not all of the SNPs in an LD block were always phased into a contiguous haplotype block. Whenever multiple haplotype blocks were found for a given LD block, we kept only those that encompassed the significant SNPs identified from the GWAS.
