The current DTC genetic testing needs more objective evidences. If they have a scientific basis from Korean population, even poor performances can have a chance to improve because they know which part needs to be updated or changed. But companies extremely rarely show the method and performance of their predictive model from Korean population.
They demand to the government authorities to allow disease prediction services as DTC genetic testing including cancer, diabetes and heart disease without disclosing their models and performances to the scientific or medical societies. If it is allowed, it will cause the profound confusion or chaos to the consumers, medical institutions, and health insurance system and the huge waste of medical resources. Currently the facility and human resources in DTC genetic testing company are not regulated by law. There is no penalty to their rejection to proficiency test by law. For improving the situation with the above mentioned direction, the legal coercion is inevitable. Amendment of Bioethics and Safety Act or making a law equivalent to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) in United States for appropriate regulation is a prerequisite step.
The predictive models of DTC genetic testing need the validation before implementation. But practically not all of the tests can be validated or achieved to the certain standard.
If so, disclosing all the relevant information transparently for the right choices by the consumers instead can be considered. The relevant information includes the explanation of the whole process of the tests, the references of the method they used, disclosing the implication and limitation of the results, how to deliver the report to consumers etc. And the company should consider the possible outcomes after getting trait(s) risk and provide the report guidelines not to cause any harm or negative effect to the consumers including psychological distress or waste of medical resources.
New genomic technologies and knowledges expand our view and their applications would improve human health. Medical diagnosis and treatment is shifting to genetic based precision medicine. Its progress is strictly guided by evidence-based medicine (EBM). In contrast, if DTC genetic testing with lack of equivalent level of EBM is not regulated, our society will pay a lot.
