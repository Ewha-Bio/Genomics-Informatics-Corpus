Restriction enzyme analysis
One microliter of the RCA product from the Prebiocide or the Tank A samples was incubated with 10 U of HindIII at 37â„ƒ overnight. Restriction digestion products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In addition, among the 9,740 clones obtained from the fosmid library constructs, subsets of randomly selected clones from the Prebiocide or Tank A samples were digested with NotI restriction enzyme for measuring insert DNA sizes.
