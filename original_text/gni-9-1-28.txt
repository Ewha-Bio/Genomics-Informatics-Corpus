Abstract

Most  statistical  methods  for  finding  interesting  genes  are 
focusing  on  the  summary  values  with  large  fold-changes 
or  large  variations.  Very  few  methods  consider  the 
probe  level  data.  We  developed  a  new  measure  to  de-
tect  reliability  that  incorporates  the  probe  level  data. 
This  reliability  measure  is  useful  for  exploring  the  micro-
array  data  without  ignoring  the  probe  level  data.  It  is 
easy  to  calculate,  and  it  can  be  used  for  all  the  other 
statistical  methods  as  a  good  guideline  to  find  real  dif-
ferentially  expressed  genes.  Instead  of  filtering  out 
genes  before  the  analysis,  we  use  whole  genes  in  the 
analysis  and  make  decisions  with  new 
reliability 
measures.

Introduction

In  Affymetrix  microarrays,  the  expression  of  each  gene 
is  measured  by  comparing  the  hybridization  of  the  sam-
ple  mRNA  to  a  set  of  probes.  A  probe  is  composed  of 
11-20  pairs  of  oligonucleotides,  each  25  base  pairs  in 
length.  The  first  type  of  probe  in  each  pair  is  known  as 
a  perfect  match  (PM),  which  is  taken  from  the  target 
gene  sequence.  The  second  type  is  known  as  a  mis-
match  (MM),  created  by  changing  the  middle  (13th) 
base  of  the  PM  sequence.  The  purpose  of  measuring 
MM  values  is  to  control  for  nonspecific  binding  of 
mRNA,  but  the  actual  use  of  MM  values  has  become 
controversial  (Lazaridis  et al.,  2001).
    A  gene  expression  experiment  is  usually  conducted 
with  multiple  arrays,  also  called  chips,  to  compare  gene 
expression  across  different  treatments  (genotype,  co-

factor,  replicate).  Each  chip  is  prepared  by  labeling  it 
with  a  fluorescent  dye  and  hybridizing  it  to  an  array. 
The  arrays  are  scanned  into  images,  which  are  numeri-
cally  processed  to  obtain  fluorescence  intensity  values 
for  each  PM  and  MM  sequence.  Gene  expression  mi-
croarrays  are  powerful  bioinformatic  tools,  but  the  varia-
bility  arising  throughout  the  measurement  process  can 
obscure  the  biological  signals  of  interest.  Quantification 
of  the  measurement  error  helps  to  extract  significant  bi-
ological  signals.
    The  chip-to-chip  variability  is  controlled  by  normal-
ization,  which  yields  the  same  distribution  of  PM  and 
MM  values  for  each  chip.  (See  Bolstad et al.,  (2003)  for 
a  comparison  of  methods.)  After  normalization,  the  val-
ues  from  a  probe  set  are  summarized  into  a  single  gene 
expression  measure,  quantifying 
the  gene  activity. 
Common  approaches  are  the  average  difference,  the 
model-based  expression  index  (Li  and  Wong,  2001),  the 
MAS  5.0  algorithm  from  Affymetrix,  and  the  robust  mul-
ti-chip  average  (rma)  (Irizarry et al.,  2003).  Fig.  1  shows 
profile  plots  for  two  genes,  265670_s_a  and  249093_at, 
each  having  11  PM  values.  The  rma  summary  ex-
pression  value  is  a  solid  line,  and  the  PM  values  are 
dashed  lines.  The  horizontal  axis  shows  the  numbers  for 
the  eight  chips,  organized  into  three  genotypes  (A,  B,  C) 
and  their  replicates,  and  the  vertical  axis  shows  the 
log-scale  expression  values.  The  gene  265670_s_a  has 
much  less  variability  in  PM  value  than  the  gene 
249093_at,  and  thus,  it  is  considered  to  have  a  more  re-
liable  measure  of  gene  expression.
    Commonly  used  models  for  finding  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes  are  ANOVA  (Churchill,  2004)  and  the 
HLM  for  one-way  ANOVA  (Chu  et al.,  2002).  These 
models  compare  the  expression  values  across  ex-
perimental  treatments  for  each  gene.  Genes  that  have 
differential  expression  on  different  treatments,  relative  to 
its  variance  over  all  chips,  will  have  a  low  p-value.  Both 
of  these  methods  use  the  summary  expression  value.  In 
practice,  with  our  data  we  have  found  that  they  also 
yield  somewhat  unsatisfactory  results.  Many  genes  on 
the  resulting  lists  have  relatively  flat,  uninteresting  pro-
files,  and  yet,  many  genes  filtered  from  the  list  have  rel-
atively  structured,  interesting  profiles.  This  has  moti-
vated  us  to  consider  using  the  PM  value  in  addition  to 
the  summary  expression  value  to  evaluate  the  sig-
nificance  of  genes. 
    Table  1  and  Table  2  show  ANOVA  results  for  two 
sample  genes,  265670_s_at  and  249093_at.  The  p-val-

ues  for  both  genes  are  very  small,  less  than  10-7,  sug-
gesting  that  both  genes  have  significantly  different  ex-
pression  between  treatments.  A  closer  look,  however,  is 
revealing.  The  gene  265670_s_at  has  a  very  large  mean 
square  treatment  effect,  4.9763,  and  a  small  mean 
square  error,  resulting  in  a  high  F  value  and  low 
p-value.  In  contrast,  the  gene  249093_at  has  a  small 
mean  square  treatment  effect,  0.1653,  and  a  very  small 
mean  square  error  effect,  0.0001,  which  also  yields  a 
high  F  value  and  low  p-value.  The  profiles  of  these  two 
genes  are  also  plotted  in  Fig.  1.  Although  both  genes 
are  significant  according  to  the  ANOVA  table,  the  genes 
are  not  alike.  One  gene  has  very  flat  profiles,  which 
makes  it  less  interesting  than  the  other  gene.
    The  two  genes  have  another  difference.  The  profiles 
of  the  PM  values  are  also  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  gene 
249093_at  has  a  lot  more  variability  in  PM  values  than 
265670_s_at.  The  variability  in  the  PM  value  should  be 
incorporated  into  a  model  for  detecting  significant  ex-
pression  differences. 
    Chu et al.  (2002)  proposed  using  the  HLM  for  one-way 
ANOVA,  which  is  a  classical  linear  mixed  model,  in-
corporating  probe-level  data,  for  modeling  expression. 
To  fit  the  model,  they  use  standard  maximum  likelihood 

(ML)  methods  using  the  Proc  Mixed  procedure  in  SAS 
and  apply  it  for  each  gene.  They  also  estimate  the  sum-
mary  values  from  this  model  and  use  them  for  further 
analysis,  like  clustering.  However,  ML  fitting  for  the 
model  might  be  too  sensitive  to  outliers.  Fig.  2  shows 
the  difference  between  RMA  summary  values  and  sum-
mary  values  from  the  HLM  model  for  two  genes, 
265670_s_at  (■)  and  249093_at  (○).  For  265670_s_at, 
the  estimated  values  from  the  HLM  model  are  similar  to 
the  RMA  summary  values.  However, 
the  gene 
249093_at,  which  has  more  varied  PM  values,  shows 
quite  different  estimated  values  from  the  HLM  model 
compared  to  the  RMA  summary  values.  This  is  due  to 
the  variation  in  the  PM  values.
    In  this  paper,  we  define  the  reliability  of  a  summary 
gene  expression  value  using  the  variation  of  probe-level 
data  and  show  how  to  use  this  reliability  measure  with 
models  for  gene  expression  analysis  and  associated 
variance  modifications,  such  as  SAM  (Tusher  et al., 
2001)  and  eBayes  (Smyth,  2004).  Reliability  quantifies 
the  uncertainty  in  gene  expression  measurements  that 
can  assist  in  filtering  out  genes  with  too  much  variability 
in  favor  of  genes  that  have  consistent  measurements 
and  significant  expression.

the  estimated  values  from  the  HLM  are  similar  to  the  RMA 
summary  values.  However,  the  gene  249093_at  shows  quite 
different  estimated  values  from  the  mixed  model  compared 
to  the  RMA  summary  values.

Methods 

We  start  from  the  2-level  hierarchical  linear  model  (HLM) 
for  one  gene.  Let  be Plk  the  log2-transformed  probe  lev-
el  intensity  value  of  the  l-th  chip  and  the  k-th  oligonu-
cleotide  probe,  l  =1,  2,  …,  L,  and  k  =1,  2,… ,  K  (usually 
between  11-20).  The  chip-to-chip  variability  is  usually 
controlled  by  normalizing  the  log2-transformed  probe  in-
tensity  values  using  the  quantile  method.  Then,  the 
probe  level  model  is 

lk MP

=

γ+
lk

l

(1)
    where Ml  represents  the  summary  expression  value  of 
the l-th  chip  and γlk  is  the  normally  distributed  random 
error  with  a  mean  of  0  and  a  probe  level  variance  σ2. 
We  assume  the  common  probe  level  variance  for  each 
chip.  Because  we  do  not  know  the  true  value  for Ml,  we 
set  the  level-2  (summary  value  level)  model  as  follows: 

lM

=

εμ+
l

(2) 
    where  μ is  the  overall  mean,  and  εl  is  the  random 
effect  associated  with  the l-th  chip,  assumed  to  be  nor-
mally  distributed  with  a  mean  of  0  and  a  variance  τ2. 
We  assume  that  εl  and  γlk  are  independent. 

    Combining  (1)  and  (2)  yields  the  model 

lkPM

=

γεμ +
lk

l

(3) 

    which  is  a  one-way  ANOVA  model  with  a  random  ef-
fect,  where  μ is  the  overall  mean,  εl  is  a  summary  val-
ue  level  random  effect,  and  γlk  is  a  probe  level  random 
effect.  Then,  the  variance  of  log2  probe  intensities  is

    The  σ2  parameter  represents  the  probe  level  varia-
bility,  and  τ2  captures  the  variability  of  the  summary 
values.  Most  models  for  finding  significant  genes  start 
from  the  summary  value  level  model,  using  the  summary 
values  and  ignoring  the  probe  level  variability.  Our  inter-
est  focuses  not  only  on  τ2  but  also  on  σ2.  If  σ2  is 
large  relative  to  τ2,  the  summary  values  of  the  chips 
might  be  less  reliable.
    In  the  2-level  HLM,  the  reliability  ρ of  the  estimated 
lMˆ   is  defined  as  follows  (Raudenbush  and  Bryk,

2002):

    where  τ2  represents  the  variation  of  the  summary 
value Ml,  and  σ2  represents  the  variation  of  log2  probe 
intensity  values  PMlm.  Therefore,  this  reliability  can  be 
written  as:

    This  measure  is  defined  from  the  structure  of  HLM 
and  represents  the  reliability  of  the  summary  expression 
values  of  the  specific  gene.  This  population  version  of 
the  reliability  is  usually  estimated  by  fitting  the  hier-
archical  model,  where  a  simple  mean  of  the  log2-trans-
formed  probe  intensity  values  is  used  as  the  summary 
value.  However,  a  simple  mean  of  the  log2  probe  in-
tensities  is  rarely  used  for  the  summary  value  in  micro-
array  data  analysis.  There  are  a  lot  of  methods  to  calcu-
late  summary  values  in  robust  way  (Bolstad  et al., 
2003),  including  RMA.  Recently,  (Millenaar  et al.,  2003) 
compared  several  calculation  methods  for  summary 
values.  They  concluded  that  the  user  needs  to  try  sev-
eral  different  methods.  However,  it  is  usually  not  easy.
    We  extend  the  approach  by  estimating  reliability  for 
any  type  of  summary  value  method.  Let  yl  be  a  sum-
mary  value  of  the  l-th  chip,  and  Pl1,  Pl2,  …,  PlK  are 
probe-level  data.  yl  is  calculated  from  Pl1,  Pl2,  …,  PlK 
using  one  of  the  summarization  methods.  Then,  our  new 
reliability  measure  is  defined  as  follows:

than  0.85.  Therefore,  if  the  ratio  of  variances  between 
probe-level  data  and  summary  values  is  less  than  or 
equal  to  1,  we  expect  to  have  a  reliability  greater  than 
0.92.  If  the  reliability  is  less  than  0.92,  in  this  case,  we 

    This  new  reliability  measure  can  be  calculated  easily 
with  several  different  summary  expression  values.  If 
RMA  is  the  summary  estimation  method,  yl  is  a  sum-
mary  value  from  RMA  (Irizarry et al.,  2003)  and  Pl1,  Pl2, 
…,  PlK  are  log2  PM  values.  If  MBEI  (Li  and  Wong,  2001) 
values  are  used,  yl  is  a  summary  value  from  the  dchip 
method  and  Pl1,  Pl2,  …,  PlK  are  log2  PM  -  log2  MM 
values.
    This  new  reliability  statistic,  ρ*,  is  easy  to  calculate, 
and  it  can  be  applied  for  a  variety  of  summary  value 
methods.  The  population  version  of  reliability  ρ in  the 
equation  (6)  is  only  for  the  2-level  HLM  model  and  can 
lMˆ .  On  the  other  hand,  the  reliability 
only  be  used  for 
statistic  ρ*  can  be  used  for  diagnostics  in  models  with 
various  summary  values.  Therefore,  it  is  possible  to 
compare  various  methods  to  calculate  summary  values 
using  this  measure.
    There  is  no  general  rule  to  decide  whether  the  reli-
ability  is  high  or  not.  We  suggest  a  guideline  that  helps 
in  decision-making.  The  definition  of  ρ*  can  be  re-stat-

    The  data  were  recorded  on  the  new  Affymetrix 
GeneChip  Arabidopsis  Genome  Array.  The  PM  values 
were  normalized  using  the  quantile  method,  and  RMA 
was  used  to  determine  the  summary  expression  value.

We  compare  the  gene  lists  resulting  from  the  eBayes 
(Smyth,  2004)  and  SAM  (Tusher  et al.,  2001)  methods, 
classical  ANOVA,  and  HLM  for  one-way  ANOVA,  along 
with  reliability.  Table  3  shows  the  results  ordered  by  the 
top  15  genes  from  classical  ANOVA.  Table  4  shows  the

Fig.  4.  Profiles  of  summary  expression  and  PM  values  for  genes  ranked  highly  by 
ANOVA  in  Table  3.  Two  genes,  246785_at  (left)  and  262128_at  (right),  are  ranked  1  and
2,  respectively,  on  the  ANOVA  list.  262128_at  has  quite  consistent  PM  values  and  big 
differences  between  the  treatments,  which  clearly  makes  it  an  interesting  gene. 
246785_at  has  slightly  less  consistency  and  less  difference  between  the  treatments, 
which  makes  it  really  less  interesting  than  the  number  2  ranked  gene.

Fig.  5.  Profiles  of  summary  expression  and  PM  values  for  genes  ranked  highly  but  hav-
ing  low  reliability  in  Table  3:  262605\_at  (left)  and  265575_at  (right)  have  large  variability 
in  PM  values.  They  have  very  low  reliability,  and  yet  they  are  ranked  in  the  top  15  by 
ANOVA  with  p-values  less  than  1.0-8;  the  profiles  suggest  that  these  two  genes  are  not
at  all  interesting.

by  HLM,  and  the  reliability  of  this  gene  is  less  than  per-
fect  at  0.846.  The  methods  disagree  on  the  significance 
of  this  gene.  The  second-ranked  gene,  262128_at,  has 
a  good  reliability  (0.993)  and  is  ranked  highly  by 
eBayes,  SAM,  and  HLM;  so,  the  methods  all  agree  that 
this  is  an  interesting  gene.  Fig.  4  shows  the  profiles  of 
PM  values  for  these  genes.  The  difference  in  variability 
of  the  PM  values  supports  the  position  that  262128_at 
is  undoubtedly  an  interesting  gene  but  that  246785_at  is 
much  less  so.
    The  worst  genes  on  this  list  (Table  3)  are  262605_at 
and  265575_at,  with  reliabilities  of  0.166  and  0.624, 
respectively.  Fig.  5  shows  the  profiles  of  PM  values  for 
these  genes.  There  is  a  lot  of  variability  in  the  PM 
values.  Although  they  are  at  the  top  of  the  ANOVA 
model's  list  of  significant  genes,  they  should  not  be  on 
a  final  list  of  interesting  genes.
    Table  4  shows  that  there  is  considerable  agreement 
about  genes  between  eBayes  and  SAM.  Both  methods 
adjust  their  test  statistics  by  shrinking  an  individual 
gene's  variance  estimate  towards  the  variance  of  all 
genes.  All  of  the  differentially  expressed  genes  on  this 
list  also  have  high  reliability.  The  HLM  disagrees  with 
eBayes  and  SAM  about  the  interestingness  of  several  of 
the  genes.
    A  comparison  of  all  of  the  genes  is  possible  using 
brushing  in  a  scatterplot  matrix  (Becker  and  Cleveland, 

1988).  Fig.  6  is  the  screenshot  of  the  brushing  being 
done  with  GGobi  (Swayne et al.,  2003).  The  scatterplot 
matrix  has  5  diagnostic  statistics:  reliability,  eBayes  F 
values,  ANOVA  F  values,  SAM  F  values,  and  HLM  χ2 
values.  (Large  test  statistics,  F,  χ2  correspond  to  small 
p-values.)  Each  point  in  this  plot  represents  one  gene, 
with  its  corresponding  values  on  the  diagnostics  plotted 
against  the  appropriate  axis.
    The  diagonal  elements  are  density  plots  of  each 
diagnostic.  The  eBayes,  ANOVA,  SAM,  and  HLM  test 
statistics  are  all  strongly  left-skewed,  which  says  that 
there  are  a  lot  more  small  values  of  these  statistics  and 
few  high  (important)  values.  Reliability  has  an  unusual 
distribution  -  fewer  genes  have  high  or  low  reliability 
and  many  more  genes  are  in  the  mid-range  of  the  scale.
    The  off-diagonal  plots  in  the  scatterplot  matrix  are  the 
(5*  4/2=10)  pairwise  plots  of  the  5  diagnostics,  which 
shows  how  the  statistics  are  related  to  each  other.  The 
values  for  eBayes  and  SAM  are  very  strongly  related, 
with  a  slight  non-linear  relationship.  eBayes  and  SAM 
have  a  reasonably  close  association  with  ANOVA,  with 
the  exception  of  a  relatively  small  number  of  the  genes. 
eBayes  and  SAM  have  a  moderate  association  with 
HLM  -  for  most  genes,  the  HLM  value  seems  to  be  the 
same  as  the  eBayes  or  SAM  value  plus  a  constant. 
ANOVA  has  almost  no  relationship  with  HLM.  Reliability 
has  a  much  different  relationship  with  each  of  the  other 

Fig.  6.  The  scatter  plot  matrix  from  GGobi.  Red  highlighted 
genes  have  high  reliability  ones.  If  they  also  have  high  val-
ues  in  the  analysis,  they  must  be  truly  differentially  ex-
pressed  ones.

Fig.  7.  The  scatter  plot  matrix  of  reliability  and  ANOVA  F 
statistics  in  GGobi.  Highlighted  genes  (red)  have  high  reli-
ability  ones.  Genes  with  high  a  ANOVA  rating  and  low  reli-
ability  are 
identified  as  246785_at,  265575_at,  and 
262605_at.

diagnostics.  Reliability  and  eBayes  have  the  strongest 
association,  where  genes  with  high  test  statistic  values 
also  generally  have  high  reliability.  Many  genes  with 
high  reliability  have  low  test  statistic  values.  This  associ-
ation  is  similar  for  SAM  and  HLM  but  not  so  for  ANOVA; 
there  are  several  genes  that  have  high  ANOVA  test  sta-
tistics  but  relatively  low  reliability.
    Brushing  on  the  scatterplot  matrix  is  done  in  the  den-
sity  plot  of  reliability.  Genes  with  the  highest  reliability 
are  brushed  (red).  These  same  genes  are  colored  (red) 
in  the  other  plots.  The  values  that  these  genes  have  on 
the  other  diagnostics  is  interesting;  they  cover  the  full 
range  of  F  statistic  values  for  eBayes,  SAM,  and  ANOVA 
but  moderate  to  high  values  of  χ2
  for  HLM.  HLM  uses 
the  PM  values,  on  which  reliability  is  calculated,  in  the 
model,  while  the  methods  do  not;  so,  there  should  be 
some  similarity  between  the  diagnostic  values.  That 
there  are  some  differences  must  be  due  to  the  use  of 
non-robust  estimates  of  the  summary  values.  Comparing 
eBayes  and  ANOVA,  the  high-reliability  genes  have  a 
very  strong  relationship,  and  there  are  many  genes  rat-
ed  highly  by  ANOVA  that  have  low  reliability.  The  most 
interesting  feature  of  the  diagnostics  revealed  by  the 
scatterplot  matrix  is  that  there  are  three  outliers,  which 
are  the  three  genes  that  eBayes,  SAM,  and  HLM  all  rate 
very  highly:  262128_at,  251428_at,  and  254098_at. 
There  is  also  an  outlier  in  the  values  of  ANOVA,  which 
have  low  reliability,  and  this  corresponds  to  the  gene 
that  ANOVA  rates  very  highly,  counter  to  all  of  the  other 
diagnostics:  246785_at.  We  also  see  several  other  out-
liers  in  the  ANOVA  and  Reliability  plot  that  have  low  reli-
ability,  two  of  which  correspond  to  265575_at  and 
262605_at  (Fig.  7).

    From  this  analysis,  it  looks  like  eBayes,  SAM,  and 
HLM  all  do  a  reasonable  job  in  finding  significantly  dif-
ferentially  expressed  genes.  However,  they  can  miss  a 
few  genes  that  perhaps  should  be  detected,  and  they 
can  also  accept  a  few  genes  that  perhaps  should  not 
be  detected.  Reliability  helps  to  uncover  these.
    Table  5  lists  5  genes  that  have  high  reliability  (＞0.9) 
and  relatively  high  ranks  (＜1,000).  But,  they  also  have 
small  fold-changes  that  might  exclude  them  if  filtering  is 
conducted  before  the  analysis.  Profiles  for  two  of  these 
genes  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.  These  genes  are  charac-
terized  by  small  differences  in  the  summary  expression 
values  for  each  treatment  but  also  by  very  consistent 
PM  values.  Based  on  the  PM  values,  to  which  eBayes 
and  SAM  are  blind,  it  could  very  well  be  argued  that 
these  are  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes. 
    Table  6  lists  5  genes  that  have  very  low  reliability 
(＜0.65)  and  relatively  high  ranks  (＜1,000).  They  would 
be  included  in  the  significantly  differently  expressed 
genes,  but  the  reliability  of  these  genes  is  very  low, 
casting  doubt  on  the  interestingness  of  these  genes. 
Based  on  the  PM  values,  to  which  eBayes  and  SAM  are 
blind,  it  could  very  well  be  argued  that  they  are  not  sig-
nificantly  differentially  expressed  genes.
    In  this  paper,  we  defined  a  new  reliability  statistic  that 
can  be  used  with  any  other  statistical  method  to  find 
differentially  expressed  genes.  This  measure  is  very 
easy  to  calculate,  relative  to  applying  the  eBayes  and 
SAM  methods.  Therefore,  it  can  be  used  easily  for  the 
exploratory  data  analysis  step  as  well  as  the  intensive 
data  analysis  step.  It  also  provides  a  guide  to  the  var-
iance  of  each  gene's  summary  expression  value.  This 
statistic  can  also  be  used  with  the  other  statistical

cluded  from  a  list  of  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes  by  all  methods.  The  pro-
files  show  that  these  genes  may  be  important.  They  have  small  differences  in  the  sum-
mary  expression  values  for  each  treatment  but  also  very  consistent  PM  values.
