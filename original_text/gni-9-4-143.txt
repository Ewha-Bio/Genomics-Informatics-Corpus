Abstract

In  this  study,  we  propose  a  novel,  intuitive  method  of 
constructing  an  expression  quantitative  trait  (eQT)  net-
work  that  is  related  to  the  metabolic  syndrome  using 
LOD  scores  and  peak  loci  for  selected  eQTs,  based  on 
the  concept  of  gene-gene  interactions.  We  selected  49 
eQTs  that  were  related  to  insulin  resistance.  A  variance 
component  linkage  analysis  was  performed  to  explore 
the  expression  loci  of  each  of  the  eQTs.  The  linkage 
peak  loci  were  investigated,  and  the  "support  zone"  was 
defined  within  boundaries  of  an  LOD  score  of  0.5  from 
the  peak.  If  one  gene  was  located  within  the  "support 
zone"  of  the  peak  loci  for  the  eQT  of  another  gene,  the 
relationship  was  considered  as  a  potential  "directed 
causal  pathway"  from  the  former  to  the  latter  gene.  SNP 
markers  under  the  linkage  peaks  or  within  the  support 
zone  were  searched  for  in  the  database  to  identify  the 
genes  at  the  loci.  Two  groups  of  gene  networks  were 
formed  separately  around  the  genes  IRS2  and  UGCGL2. 
The  findings  indicated  evidence  of  networks  between 
genes  that  were  related  to  the  metabolic  syndrome.  The 
use  of  linkage  analysis  enabled  the  construction  of  di-
rected  causal  networks.  This  methodology  showed  that 
characterizing  and  locating  eQTs  can  provide  an  effec-
tive  means  of  constructing  a  genetic  network.

lenge  in  human  genetic  studies  and  chronic  disease  epi-
demiology  due  to  the  complexity  of  its  biological  implica-
tions.  Metabolic  syndrome,  which  is  diverse  in  pathology 
and  considered  to  be  a  growing  health  problem,  con-
sists  of  a  cluster  of  endocrine-metabolic  disorders,  such 
as  hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  glucose  intolerance,  and 
abdominal  obesity  (Reaven,  2002).  Insulin  resistance  has 
been  considered  an  underlying  risk  factor  of  these  en-
docrine  disorders  (Reaven,  1988),  and  its  pathological  or 
epidemiological  characteristics  have  been  continually  in-
vestigated,  including  its  genetic  aspects.  Genetic  studies 
on  metabolic  syndrome  have  been  conducted  mostly 
using  the  candidate  gene  approach,  with  much  success 
in  identifying  its  genetic  components  (Bonnet  et al., 
2008;  Groop,  2000;  Horenstein  and  Shuldiner,  2004;  Ma 
et al.,  2007;  Mercado  et al.,  2002;  Sale  et al.,  2006; 
Stern,  2003;  Vasseur  et al.,  2006;  Wang  et al.,  2004; 
Yang  and  Chuang,  2006).  Some  studies  have  focused 
on  the  relationships  between  components  of  the  meta-
bolic  syndrome  (Kopf  et al.,  2008;  Mussig  et al.,  2009) 
or  among  the  candidate  genes  that  are  related  to  it 
(Foufelle  and  Ferre,  2002).  However,  the  mechanism  that 
underlies  the  interrelationships  between  related  genes 
has  been  not  fully  determined,  and  although  various 
genes  contribute  to  the  disease,  the  effect  size  of  a  sin-
gle  gene  is  very  weak.
    Understanding  genetic  components  represents  a  chal-
lenge  in  not  only  insulin  resistance  but  also  most  com-
plex  diseases.  To  unravel  the  underlying  genetic  mecha-
nisms  for  complex  diseases,  various  concepts  and  meth-
ods  have  been  applied,  such  as  gene-network  (Wessels 
et al.,  2001),  pathway  analysis  (Yu  et al.,  2009),  and 
gene-regulator  approaches  (de  Jong,  2002;  Hasty et al., 
2001).  Gene  set  approaches,  such  as  network  modeling, 
can  be  utilized  when  information  on  the  genetic  pathway 
is  lacking.
    Various  studies  have  contributed  to  determining  gene- 
gene  interactions  by  constructing  gene  network  models 
using  several  statistical  approaches  (Markou  and  Singh, 
2003a).  Some  studies  have  applied  computational  meth-
ods,  such  as  neural  network  models  (Markou  and  Singh, 
2003b;  Vohradsky,  2001).  Gene  network  models  that  are 
based  on  statistical  and  computational  approaches  have 
been  helpful  in  detecting  the  "lines"  of  gene-gene  inter-
actions.  However,  exploring  the  biological  or  functional 
directions  of  network  lines  still  remains  a  challenge,  be-

144 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  9(4)  143-151,  December  2011

cause  the  biological  implication  of  these  models  has 
mostly  been  unconsidered  and  because  interpreting  the 
metabolic  pathway  among  the  networked  genes  can  be 
difficult.  The  biological  aspect  of  disease-related  metab-
olites  must  be  taken  into  account  due  to  its  importance 
in  understanding  gene-gene  interactions.  A  clear  exam-
ple  can  be  seen  in  the  components  of  metabolic  syn-
drome,  such  as  insulin,  lipid,  glucose,  and  adiponectin, 
which  interact  with  each  other.  Glucose  metabolism  in-
teracts  with  lipid  metabolism  via  the  central  nervous 
system  (Schulingkamp et al.,  2000).  The  insulin  pathway 
is  associated  with  adipose  metabolism,  which  is  evident 
in  certain  disorders,  such  as  fatty  liver  disease  (Bouzakri 
et al.,  2006;  Kantartzis et al.,  2009;  Previs et al.,  2000). 
The  challenges,  nonetheless,  are  in  detecting  the  inter-
actions  and  effects  of  genes  on  each  other.
    To  solve  this  problem,  some  studies  have  suggested 
the  concept  of  a  causal  network,  which  consists  of  bio-
logical  functions  and  implications  in  the  gene  network 
construction  (Schadt  and  Lum,  2006).  This  approach  has 
been  useful  in  clarifying  how  genetic  networks  intervene 
in  the  biological  pathway  of  animal  populations  (Kulp 
and  Jagalur,  2006;  Schadt et al.,  2005;  Tu et al.,  2006). 
In  humans,  however,  the  causal  genetic  network  re-
mains  a  challenge  because  of  its  complexity  and  numer-
ous  associated  factors,  including  environmental  and  be-
havioral  variables. 
    In  this  study,  we  demonstrated  a  simple,  intuitive 
method  of  constructing  a  directed  causal  network  with 
an  expression  quantitative  trait  (eQT)  that  is  related  to 
metabolic  syndrome.  We  aimed  to  explore  the  direction 
that  supported  the  biological  function  of  the  eQTs  and 
not  base  our  interpretation  solely  on  statistical  signifi-
cance.  To  identify  the  direction,  we  used  information 
from  the  peak  loci  of  each  eQT  via  variance  component 
linkage  analysis.  The  use  of  these  eQTs,  which  was  ob-
tained  during  mRNA  transcription,  can  be  helpful  in 
identifying  the  genetic  components  that  are  associated 
with  disease  (Rockman  and  Kruglyak,  2006).  In  the 
Materials  and  Methods  section,  we  describe  the  data 
that  we  obtained  and  the  eQT  selection  criteria.  The 
methodology  of  constructing  the  directed  gene  network 
modelvia  linkage  analysis  is  also  referred  to  in  this 
section.  In  the  Results  section,  we  present  the  linkage 
peak  loci  and  logarithm  of  the  odds  (base  10)  (LOD) 
scores  of  important  eQTs.  We  also  describe  the  gene 
network  model  that  is  associated  with  metabolic  syn-
drome  by  matching  the  peak  loci  and  several  specific 
genes.  In  the  Discussion  section,  we  show  the  biological 
implication  of  our  results  with  an  inquiry  into  our  meth-
odology  of  gene  network  construction.

Methods

Data  and  materials

Data  were  obtained  from  Problem  1  (Genetics  of  Gene 
Expression  Variation  in  Humans)  of  the  15th  Genetic 
Analysis  Workshop  (GAW15)  and  contained  194  in-
dividuals  in  14  3-generation  Centre  d'Etude  du  Polymor-
phisme  Humain  (CEPH)  Utah  families  (Cheung  and 
Spielman,  2007;  Morley  et al.,  2004).  The  expression 
levels  of  3554  genes  in  lymphoblastic  cells  were  ana-
lyzed  as  phenotypes.  From  these  genes,  we  selected  49 
eQTs  that  are  known  to  be  associated  with  insulin  re-
sistance,  based  on  previous  studies  and  gene 
databases.  The  basic  characteristics  of  the  selected 
eQTs  are  presented  in  Table  1.   
    The  genotype  data  were  collected  for  2884  single- 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  markers  across  22  auto-
somal  chromosomes  and  the  X-linked  chromosome  from 
194 individuals. Sex-averaged Rutgers Combined Linkage- 
Physical  Map  (Matise et al.,  2007)  was  matched  with  the 
original  map  file  to  account  for  the  recombination  frac-
tion  of  given  SNP  markers.

Gene  network  model  construction  via  linkage 
analysis

For  each  of  the  49  metabolic  syndrome-related  eQTs, 
variance  component  linkage  analysis,  which  is  commonly 
used  for  mapping  quantitative  trait  loci,  was  performed 
to  search  the  genomic  loci  with  a  linkage  peak  across 
22  autosomal  chromosomes.  Note  that  the  X-linked  23rd 
chromosome  was  excluded  from  the  investigation.  The 
linkage  peak  loci  were  investigated,  and  the  "support 
zone"  was  defined  within  the  bounds  up  to  an  LOD 
score  of  0.5  from  the  peak.  Fig.  1  represents  an  exam-
ple  of  a  linkage  peak  point  and  support  zone  identi-
fication  with  an  eQT  of  the  IRS2  gene. 
    To  explore  gene-gene  interactions,  we  studied  the  re-
lationships  between  all  possible  pairs  of  the  49  genes. 
We  investigated  whether  SNP  markers,  which  are  lo-
cated  on  the  linkage  peak,  were  found  in  several  specif-
ic  genes.  If  one  gene  was  located  within  the  "support 
zone"  of  the  peak  loci  for  the  eQT  of  another  gene,  the 
relationship  was  considered  as  a  potential  "directed 
causal  pathway"  from  the  former  to  the  latter  gene,  ac-
cording  to  the  following  logic;  if  there  is  a  linkage  be-
tween  eQT  as  a  phenotype  and  a  genetic  locus,  the 
causal  direction  can  be  assumed  to  be  from  the  gene 
to  the  phenotype,  rather  than  the  opposite  direction. 
Since  a  particular  eQT  represents  the  function  of  the  un-
derlying  gene  (e.g.,  A),  the  greatest  linkage  signal  is  ob-
served  on  the  locus  of  A.  In  addition,  if  the  eQT  for  A

Results

Linkage  analysis  of  eQTs

To  identify  the  network  model  of  the  gene  expression 
levels  that  were  related  to  metabolic  syndrome,  variance 
component  linkage  analyses  were  performed  individually 
with  the  49  selected  eQTs.  Table  2  represents  the  LOD 
scores  and  linkage  peak  loci  of  14  eQTs.  We  identified 
about  14  linkage  peaks  with  LOD  scores  ＞2.0  for  eQTs, 
with  6  of  these  eQTs  displaying  LOD  scores  ＞2.5.  For 
the  genes  ADFP  and  IRS2,  the  highest  LOD  scores  of 
3.09  and  3.08  were  observed  at  SNPs  on  chromosomes 
5  and  2,  respectively.

Comparison  of  linkage  peak  loci

To  explore  gene-gene  interactions,  we  investigated  whe-
ther  the  SNP  markers  on  the  linkage  peak  or  in  the 
"support  zone"  were  included  in  several  specific  genes. 
The  results  showed  that  several  SNP  markers  colo-
calized  within  these  genes.  Since  we  used  a  small  SNP 
marker  set,  we  considered  that  the  49  selected  eQTs 
might  not  have  been  identified  with  the  linkage  analysis.

and  support  zone.

is  also  linked  with  another  gene  B,  this  linkage  also  im-
plies  a  causal  direction  from  gene  B  to  the  eQT  pheno-
type,  which  suggests  a  causal  connection  from  gene  B 
to  gene  A,  which  underlies  the  eQT.  Genes  from  the  49 
selected  eQTs  were  preferentially  included  in  the  meta-
bolic  syndrome-related  gene  network  model  due  to  their 
association  with  the  mechanisms  of  the  disease.  Other 
genes,  which  were  identified  with  SNP  markers  in  the 
support  zone,  were  also  added  in  the  directed  network 
model.  Merlin  1.1.2  software  was  used  for  the  variance 

146 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  9(4)  143-151,  December  2011

Therefore,  we  searched  the  location  of  each  selected 
eQT  in  the  NCBI  gene  database  to  determine  whether 
the  location  of  each  eQT  coincided  with  the  linkage 
peak. 
    Tables  3  and  4  show  the  relationship  between  genes 
pairs  with  LOD  scores  of  ＞2.0.  Eight  genes,  LRRIQ1, 
APOL3,  APOL4,  IGSF4,  ASTN2,  NRP1,  SFXN1,  and 
ASCL3,  were  located  on  the  peak  of  eQTs,  known  as 
IGF1,  UGCGL2,  IDE,  BCL2,  BCAP29,  VEGFB,  PTPN6, 
and  APOBEC3B,  respectively.  Thirty-one  genes  were  lo-
cated  in  the  support  zone.  Among  the  total  39  genes  at 
both  the  peak  point  and  support  zone,  7  genes,  known 
as  APOL3,  IGFBP2,  BTG1,  UGCGL2,  LEPR,  APOL6,  and 
IRS2,  were  included  in  the  49  selected  eQTs. 

Directed  gene  network  construction

The  gene  network  was  constructed  with  the  selected 
eQTs,  from  which  two  groups  of  gene  networks  were 
formed,  each  around  the  genes  IRS2  and  UGCGL2  (Fig. 
2).  IRS2  was  grouped  with  6  genes,  APOBEC3B,  BTG1, 
HDLBP,  IDE,  IGF1,  and  IGFBP2.  To  explore  the  biologi-
cal  network,  the  functions  of  each  gene  were  searched 
via  the  NCBI  gene  database.  The  IRS2  gene,  which  be-
longs  to  an  insulin  receptor  substrate  family,  is  known 
to  play  a  role  in  the  insulin  signaling  pathway.  The  cog-
rouped  genes  were  also  related  to  insulin  metabolism. 
We  found  a  stream  from  IGFBP2  to  IDE,  which  con-
sisted  completely  of  genes  that  play  a  role  in  insulin

metabolism.  The  UGCGL2  gene  is  known  to  transfer 
glycosyl  groups  (Arnold  and  Kaufman,  2003).  It  showed 
a  directed  network  with  4  genes,  known  as  APOL3, 
APOL6,  LEPR,  and  UGP2.  This  grouped  network  showed 
a  pathway  of  adipose,  lipid,  and  glucose  metabolites. 
LEPR,  the  leptin  receptor,  is  known  to  be  related  to  adi-
pose  tissue  mass  regulation  (Kershaw  and  Flier,  2004; 
Ronti et al.,  2006).  APOL3  and  APOL6  both  play  a  role 
in  lipid  metabolism,  in  lipid  transportation  and  lipid  bind-
ing,  respectively.  UGP2,  which  was  identified  as  being 
influenced  by  UGCGL2  in  our  study,  undertakes  glucose 
transfer,  especially  in  liver  and  muscle  tissues.  The 
shape  of  the  gene  network  between  the  two  groups  is 
distinct.  The  network  around  the  IRS2  gene  displays  a 
flow  of  the  insulin  pathway.  However,  in  the  second 
group  surrounding  the  UGCGL2  gene,  3  of  the  other 
genes  that  were  identified  influence  UGCGL2.  According 

to  these  results,  we  can  propose  that  IRS2  plays  a  role 
as  an  intermediator  in  the  insulin  metabolism  pathway 
and  that  UGCGL2  appears  to  be  at  the  center  of  the 
lipid  and  glucose  metabolism  pathway.

Discussion

In  this  study,  we  aimed  to  construct  a  directed  gene 
network  that  was  related  to  metabolic  syndrome  via 
comparison  of  the  linkage  peak  loci  and  LOD  scores  of 
selected  eQTs.  Since  the  genetics  of  metabolic  syndrome 
is  polygenic  and  heterogeneous  (Mercado et al.,  2002), 
the  gene  set  approach  that  we  have  presented  in  this 
study  can  be  helpful  in  understanding  the  genetic  com-
ponents  of  the  disease.  We  explored  the  direction  that 
supported  the  biological  gene  function.  Two  groups  of 
gene  networks  were  constructed,  each  surrounding  the

genes  IRS2  and  UGCGL2.  The  former  networking  group 
showed  the  pathway  that  was  related  to  insulin  metabo-
lism,  and  the  latter  represented  lipid  and  glucose 
metabolism.
    We  identified  the  direction  among  gene-gene  inter-
actions,  and  several  genes  could  be  supported  with 
known  biological  pathways,  reported  in  previous  studies. 
For  example,  the  BTG1  gene  was  identified  in  our  study 
as  belonging  to  a  group  that  was  surrounded  with  IRS2, 
which  belongs  to  a  family  of  insulin  receptor  substrate 
proteins  (Saltiel  and  Kahn,  2001).  It  supports  the  known 
biological  correlation  that  gene  expression  of  BTG1  is 
regulated  by  insulin  (Kuiperij,  2004).  Insulin  also  plays  a 
role  in  the  insulin-like  growth  factor-binding  protein 
(IGFBP)  system  (Kelley et al.,  1996),  as  shown  in  the  re-
lationship  between  IRS2  and  IGFBP2  in  the  present 
study.  Also,  we  could  find  the  IGF1  and  IRS2  genes  in 
the  same  network  in  this  study,  which  could  be  sup-
ported  by  a  previous  report  that  demonstrated  that  a 
decrease  in  IGF1  causes  the  degradation  of  IRS2  (Rui 
et al.,  2001).  We  also  found  studies  that  support  our  re-
sults  regarding  the  second  group  (e.g.,  leptin  is  asso-
ciated  with  glucose  levels)  (Schwartz  et al.,  1996). 
    According  to  our  results,  the  leptin  receptor  LEPR 
gene  affects  a  glucose-related  gene,  UGCGL2.  Apolipo-
protein-related  genes,  such  as  APOL3,  APOL4,  and 
APOL6,  in  our  gene  network  are  also  associated  with 
glucose  metabolism,  as  suggested  by  increased  apoli-
poprotein  levels  in  glucose-impaired  patients  (Pietzsch 
et al.,  1998). 
    Since  the  biological  correlation  between  endocrine- 

metabolic  components  remains  undiscovered,  we  could 
not  confirm  the  relationship  between  all  of  the  genes  in 
our  network.  However,  our  results  also  support  the  evi-
dence  of  a  gene  network,  which  was  not  based  solely 
on  biological  evidence.  We  intended  to  replicate  our  re-
sults  with  a  prior  gene  network  model,  which  included 
gene  function  with  the  network  construction  (Franke  et 
al.,  2006).  A  gene  pathway  previously  known  via  Franke 
et al.  was  found  in  our  study  to  have  relatively  simple 
structure  associated  with  a  higher  LOD  score.  The  net-
work  between 
the  genes  ASCL  and  APOBEC3B 
(LOD=2.46)  consists  of  only  3  genes.  In  contrast,  BTG1 
and  IGF1  (LOD=1.5)  constitute  a  more  complex  network 
with  12  related  genes  (Fig.  3).  We  can  suppose  that 
higher  LOD  scores  indicate  a  stronger  effect  on  other 
genes  and  that  their  biological  pathway  is  more  directly 
associated  with  each  other.
    This  study  presents  a  robust,  directed  causal  network 
construction  via  linkage  analysis.  Linkage  analysis  and 
eQTs  can  be  utilized  to  explore  gene-gene  interaction 
mechanisms,  including  their  biological  implications.  We 
also  anticipate  that  our  method  will  help  overcome  the 
challenge  of  computational  complexity  and  the  cost  of 
constructing  genetic  networks  (Markou  and  Singh,  2003b; 
Wessels  et al.,  2001)  due  to  the  simplicity  of  linkage 
analysis  to  identify  gene  expression  loci. 
    However,  this  method  of  genetic  network  construction 
has  several  limitations.  A  linkage  analysis  with  additional 
SNP  markers,  which  will  increase  its  density,  may  gen-
erate  more  accurate  LOD  scores  and  increase  the  link-
age  support  zone.  An  analysis  with  more  eQTs  and  oth-

er  criteria  to  establish  boundaries  of  the  "support  zone" 
can  also  affect  the  results.  However,  in  our  study,  the 
support  zone  had  LOD  scores  ＞1.7.  We  considered 
this  boundary  to  be  acceptable,  based  on  an  LOD  score 
range  of  1.7-1.8,  which  has  been  considered  potential 
evidence  of  linkage  among  genes  (Avery  et al.,  2004; 
Comuzzie et al.,  2001;  Lindgren et al.,  2002;  Zhu et al., 
2002).
    Despite  these  limitations,  we  anticipate  that  our  study 
will  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the  genetic  com-
ponents  that  are  involved  in  metabolic  syndrome.  Our 
methodology  supports  the  characterization  and  location 
of  eQTs  as  an  effective  approach  for  constructing  a  ge-
netic  network.
