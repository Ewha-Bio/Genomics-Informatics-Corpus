Abstract 
Adaptive responses to diverse microbial pathogens might 
be limited in  relatively few types.  Host cell  responses to 
pathogens are  believed to be  patterned  or stereotyped 
along with species or class. We tried to compose the host 
response  to  Mycoplasma  in  terms  of  cellular  gene 
expression. Although gene expression profile of two host 
Hela and  293 cells were quite different each other,  30 
genes  were  differentially  expressed  by  mycoplasma 
infection in both of Hela and 293 cells. Six of them (PR48, 
MADH4, MKPX, CRK, RBM7, NEK3) were related to cell 
cycle  or  proliferation.  Another  category  of  genes  like 
IL 1 HY1, KLRF1, TNFSF14, GBP1  were host defense to 
elicit immune responses. With this set of genes, we establish 
the prediction model for mycoplasma contamination.

Introduction 

The  Mycoplasma,  with  over  100  different  species,  are 
the smallest self-replicating organisms known at present 
and  constitute  a  distinct  class  within  the  prokaryotes 
characterized by their lack of a rigid cell  wall.  They can 
be classified into fermentative strains, which gain energy 
by fermentation  of carbohydrates and non-fermentative 
strains that are unable to metabolize carbohydrates via 
glycolysis. The mycoplasmas are extra cellular parasites 
usually attached to the external surface of cells, but can 
also penetrate these (Razin eta/.,  1998). In humans,  M. 
pneumoniae is a frequent cause of respiratory infections, 
and is at the origin of approximately 20 %of all community(cid:173)
acquired  pneumonias  (Hammerschlag,  2001 ).  Being

'minimal  cells',  Mycoplasma  have  also  been  used  to 
investigate the machinery of self-replicating  organisms 
(Razin,  1992). 

Beside health problems,  mycoplasma contamination 
constitutes one frequent problem when studying cultured 
cells (estimated frequency varying from 5 to 35 %). The 
strains M.  hyorhinis,  M.  orale,  M.  arginini,  M.  fermetans, 
M.  hominis and Acholeplasma laidlawii represent 90-95 
%  of  the  contaminating  isolates  (Hay  et  a/.,  1989). 
Contamination is initially often difficult to detect because 
the contaminated culture grows well and appears normal 
by ordinary light microscopy. In addition, Mycoplasma is 
highly contagious and can rapidly spread through the cell 
stocks.  The  possible  consequences  of  mycoplasma 
infection  for  the  host-cells  are  multiple  and  variable, 
ranging  from  no  apparent  effect  to  extensive  changes 
with inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, 
induction  of  cytokines  and  oxidative  radicals,  and 
malignant  transformation  (Avron  and  Gallily,  1995; 
Sokolova eta/.,  1998; Tsai  eta/., 1995). There is also a 
possibility  that  mycoplasmal  biological  activities  may 
erroneously be interpreted as being of host origin (Choi et 
a/.,  1998). 

Understanding  the  molecular  basis  of  a  host's 
response to microbial infection is essential for preventing 
disease and tissue damage as a result of the inflammatory 
response. A better understanding of this process should 
allow for the design of drugs that can more specifically and 
effectively target infected cells with reduced side-effects. 
The host-pathogen interaction can result in many changes 
to the host cell including modulation of RNA expression, 
target receptor induction, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, 
signal  transduction  pathway  activation,  and  vacuolar 
trafficking  (Finlay  and  Cossart,  1997;  Cummings  and 
Reiman, 2000). DNA microarray enabled us to describe a 
unique biological phenomenon in terms of genome-wide 
gene expression analysis.  It can provide a bird-eye view 
on a certain phenomenon as well as complete list on the 
significant genes. Gene expression profiling using DNA 
microarray has been offering potentials for defining the 
patterns  especially  on  gene  expression  during  normal 
biological  or  disease  processes.  Moreover,  many  of 
differentially expressed genes that may play an  integral 
role in these processes were identified. 

In this paper, we have utilized spotted oligonucleotide 
microarray to examine the expression of  1 0,416 known

regulatory  genes  upon  mycoplasma 
infection.  We 
compare the distribution of patterns of gene expressions in 
two different cell lines, Hela and 293 cells. After that we 
select 30  genes that  expressed  differentially in  both  of 
Hela  and  293  cells,  as  biomarkers  for  Mycoplasma 
infection. Actual prediction model for the infection is also 
discussed. 

Materials and Methods 
Cell culture and Mycoplasma infection 
We  used  Hela  and  293  cells  were  maintained  in 
Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (DMEM, JBI, Seoul, 
Korea) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JBI), 
1 %  Penicillin-Streptomycin  (Invitrogen).  Cells  were 
plated  in  concentration  of  2-5x1 06  per  T75  flask  18  h 
before mycoplasma infection. M. hyoriniswere harvested 
at log phase to treat onto cells at 1 08 per T75 flask. After 
48 h, cells were washed with phosphate buttered saline 
and harvested for RNA preparation. 

RNA extraction 
Total  cellular  RNA  was  prepared  using  RNAeasy total 
RNA purification kit (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA) followed by 
treatment with RNase-free RQ DNase (Promega Corp., 
Madison,  WI}.  For  eDNA  synthesis,  random  hexamer 
primers  (Gibco/BRL)  were  used  to  prime  reverse 
transcriptase  (RT)  reactions.  Using this  method  it was 
possible to  use the same  RT reaction  (eDNA)  for  PCR 
amplification with different sets of gene-specific primers. 
The  eDNA  synthesis  was  carried  out  using  Moloney 
murine  leukemia  virus  (M-MLV)  Superscript  II  reverse 
transcriptase  (Gibco/BRL)  following  the  manufacturer's 
instructions. To  analyze  relative  expression  of  different 
mRNAs, the amount of eDNA was normalized based on 
the signal from ubiquitously expressed actin mRNA. 

Oligonucleotide microarray 
Total  RNAs from control  or Mycoplasma-infected Hela 
or 293 cells  used as to  extract total  RNA  for  quantipli(cid:173)
cated experiment including one dye-swapping set. 

Total  RNA  was  prepared  by  using  TriZol  reagent 
(Gibco-BRL).  The  array  used  in  this  experiment  was 
MacArray  (Oligo-Human  10K,  Macrogen  Inc.,  Seoul, 
Korea) according to the manual provided by manufacturer. 
Briefly,  100 11g of total  RNA was labelled by incubating it 
with  Cyanine-3-dUTP  (6.0  mM)  (Perkin  Elmer  Life 
Sciences} or Cyanine-5-dUTP (4.0 mM) (Perkin Elmer Life 
Sciences), dNTP mixture, 0.1 M DTT, RnaseOUT, inorganic 
pyrophosphatase,  reverse  transcriptase  at  40 OC  for  3 
hours.  Before  hybridization,  8 11g  of  Cyanine-3-CTP 

labelled cRNA and 8 11g of Cyanine-5-CTP labelled cRNA 
were  mixed together with  2.5  td of Mouse  Cot-1  DNA 
(Invitrogen), 2.5  fJ),  of Deposition control target (Operon 
Technologies),  and  12.5  fJ),  of  2Xhybridization  butter 
(Agilent Technologies).  The mixture was centrifuged  at 
12,000 rpm for 3 min after it was boiled for 2 min. About 
24 fJ),  of the mixture was hybridized on the array at 65 OC 
for 16 h.  After hybridization, the array was washed with 
solution  I  (0.5xSSC,  0.01%  SDS,  and  1  mM  DTT  in 
nuclease-free water), solution II (0.25xSSC, 0.01% SDS, 
and  1 mM DTT in nuclease-free water),  and solution  Ill 
(0.06xSSC  and  1 mM  DTT  in  nuclease-free  water) 
respectively.  Cy3  and  Cy5  fluorescent  intensities were 
determined  using 
(Axon 
Instruments), and images were analyzed using the built-in 
program  to  calculate  relative  ratios  and  to  determine 
confidence intervals. 

the  GenePix  scanner 

Data analysis 
Fluorescence  intensity  was  processed  and  measured 
using GenePix Pro software (Axon Instruments). Intensity 
data were imported to an in-house microarray database. 
Variance  stabilizing  normalization  by  Huber  eta/.  was 
applied with the 'vsn' package in Bioconductor using the 
R statistical package. After performing intensity-dependent 
global LOWESS regression, spatial and intensity dependent 
effects were managed by pin-group LOWESS normalization 
following by the approach of Yang eta/.  A variation filter 
was used to reduce the number of genes for the following 
cluster analysis. Specifically, we applied the non-parametric 
Kruskaii-Wallis one-way analysis of variance to eliminate 
the genes that did not change significantly across samples. 

Results 
Characteristics of host response to Mycoplasma 
Host responses to mycoplasma infection were tested in 
two different human cell  lines,  Hela and  293,  which  is 
usually used by molecular biology experiments. Subconfluent 
cells at 2-5x1 06 cells per 100 mm dish were incubated with 
mycoplasma pellet at the concentration of 1 08  per 10 ml 
media. Gross morphology of each cells was not significantly 
changed upon microbial  infections. To stabilize the host(cid:173)
pathogen interaction, we incubated cells with Mycoplasma 
for 48 h. The transcripts of infected cells were compared with 
uninfected control cells. 

Overall  expression  similarities  for  each  samples  of 
microarray data is provided in Fig. 1. These measures in 
the  table  are  calculated  as  a  pattern-similarity  of  two 
samples.  The  absolute  value  of  Pearson  correlation 
coefficient is used for the pattern-similarity. According to

Selection of biomarkers for Mycoplasma infection 
From  the  quadruplicated  profile  of  1 OK  oligonucleotide 
microarray in each cells, we selected genes for the host 

responses to  mycoplasma infection  under the following 
standards (Table 1) : 

i)  Standard  deviation  in  both  of infected  and  control 
groups should be less than two fold in both cell  lines, ii) 
Average fold activation of infected groups should exceed 
two fold. iii) Average fold activation of uninfected control 
group should be less than two fold. iv) Activation of gene

expression should be found in both of Hela and 293 cells. 
According to the GO (http://www.geneontology.org/), 
we  could  classify  these  30  genes  in  their  biological 
functions  (Table  1 ).  In  view  of  biological  effect  of 
Mycoplasma infection,  we found  that  two categories  of 
genes like cell  cycle/proliferation and immune response 
were changed upon the infection. Especially Mycoplasma 
leads to the growth retardation or arrest in vitro, which might 
be explained by the transcriptional activation of genes like 
PR48, MADH4 and MKPX. Although two cell lines were not 
from immunological tissues, we detected the increase of 
transcripts like IL 1 HY1,  KLRF1, TNFSF14 and GBP1. 

Prediction model for Mycoplasma contamination 
The 30 genes selected significantly, listed in Table 1, are 
believed that they are strongly involved the  process  of 
mycoplasma infection in human cells. From this fact, we 
define  the  contamination  index  for  a  given  sample  of 
microarray, as follows: 

30 
1 
CI(S)=- ~ 
30  z=l 

where {g1,  ... , g30} is the set of gene in Table 1,  M(g,s) 
is the log-ratio of expression of g under the samples, and 
/(x) = 
isthefunctiont hat indicate the 

exp( -5 +5  I xI 2 
1 +exp( -5+5 I xI 

probability of a gene with expression value x became a 
differentially expressed gene. 

Since these genes are differentially expressed in both 
cells,  we  may  consider  that  the  contamination  index 
Cl(s)  reflects  that  whether  the  unknown  sample  s  is 
infected  by  Mycoplasma  or  not.  To  give  a  specific 
criterion  for mycoplasma contamination,  we  calculated 
the contamination  indices with  respect to the  randomly 
selected genes. Mean values and standard deviations of 
the  indices for each  samples are extracted  by iterating 
these process 1 ,000 times. Parameters in random model 
are listed in Table 2.

We set a criterion to predict contamination by Mycoplasma 

for a given sample s as follows: 

Cl(s) > m + 3*o-, 

where m and  o- are mean and standard deviation in 
random  model,  respectively.  The  threshold  "m+3*cr"  is 
taken to satisfy that the false positive rate is less than 0.01. 
That is,  the  probability of Cl(s)  > m+3*o- when  s  is  not 
contaminated by Mycoplasma is less than 0.01. According 
to the Table 2, only the case of sample "293 cell-replication 
2" fails to predict the mycoplasma contamination out of 8 
total samples.  In the sample "293 cell-replication 2",  we 
observe that the contamination index (0.16773) is much 
larger than  the  mean  contamination  index  (0.0857)  for 
randomly  selected  genes,  but  the  standard  deviation 
(0.0431) is relatively large to the contamination index, so 
the  log-expression  profile  in  the sample is far from  the 
normal  distribution,  which  is  a  basic assumption of our 
predicting model. 

Discussion 
Efforts in functional genomics related to cancer research 
have  yielded  major  successes  in  the  pursuit  of  gene 
expression signatures. Approaches for gene expression 
analysis, such as time-series analysis, pattern discovery, 
clustering,  and  class  prediction,  have  been  recently 
reviewed  (Solnim,  2002).  Expression-based  criteria  or 
class predictors have been defined based on neighborhood 
analysis (Golub, 1999), a supervised method based on a 
subset  of  genes  whose  expression  strongly correlates 
with  specific  classes,  as  well  as  Bayesian  regression 
models (West, 2001) and artificial neural networks (Khan, 
2001 ). These predictors were successfully used to classify 
novel  samples  in  a  manner  consistent  with  clinical 
assessments.  In  fact,  classifications  based  on  gene 
expression  alone  or  class  discovery  have  also  been

demonstrated  and  suggesting  that  gene  expression 
profiling have the capacity to identify subtypes that have 
not  been  previously  defined  (Golub,  1999).  Although 
these results are promising, one should note that many of 
the  previously  conducted  cancer  line  gene  expression 
analyses  are  one  dimensional;  in  contrast,  a  host 
expression profile evoked by pathogen exposure would be 
expected  to  be  temporal  and  may  also  exhibit  dose 
dependence.  Comprehensive  sets  of  gene  expression 
profiles  that  explore  temporal  and  dose  ranges  for 
pathogen exposure must be produced to map the continuum 
of gene expression changes. 

In this paper, we suggested a list of genes that is believed 
to strongly related to the mycoplasma contamination in 
two different  human  cell  lines,  Hela and  293.  We also 
suggested a model to predict that a given sample is infected 
by the mycoplasma. This naive process has strong power 
to predict, and is suitable to the our data which has unique 
structure  that  consisted  of  expression  of  genes  upon 
infection  in  various  experimental  conditions  such  as 
cell-lines or dose ranges. To get a more strong prediction 
power  for  overall-non-contamination  of  a  concerned 
sample, we need a structural experimental profiling data for 
host response of infection by wide source of pathogens.
