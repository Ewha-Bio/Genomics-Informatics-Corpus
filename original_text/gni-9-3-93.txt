and  outer  root  sheath  (ORS)  (Fig.  1;  Blanpain  et al.,

teins  that  contribute  to  HF  keratinization,  leading  to  for-
mation  of  a  rigid  structure  (Langbein  et al.,  2005;  Shi-

they  start  to  lose  hair  from  the  head  and  continue  to 
lose  it  until  reaching  the  caudal  area  (Brooke,  1926). 
Then,  this  hairless  phenotype  is  permanent  hence  the 
name  ‘hairless’.  A  study  of  Hrhr  mutant  mice  has  re-
vealed  that  the Hr  gene  is  important  for  hair  growth  and 
the  hair  cycle  (Panteleyev et al.,  1998).  The  rat hr  gene 
was  isolated  as  a  gene  that  is  regulated  by  thyroid  hor-
mone  (Thompson,  1996),  and  the  human HR  gene  was 
identified  as  a  gene  that  is  responsible  for  congenital 
hair  disorders  (Ahmad  et al.,  1998a;  Ahmad  et al.,

Abstract

The Hairless  (HR)  gene  regulates  the  expression  of  sev-
eral  target  genes  as  a  transcriptional  corepressor  of  nu-
clear  receptors.  The  hair  follicle  (HF),  a  small  independ-
ent  organ  of  the  skin,  resides  in  the  epidermis  and  un-
dergoes  regenerative  cycling  for  normal  hair  formation. 
HF  development  requires  many  genes  and  signaling 
pathways  to  function  properly  in  time  and  space,  one  of 
them  being  the HR  gene.  Various  mutations  of  the HR 
gene  have  been  reported  to  cause  the  hair  loss  pheno-
type  in  rodents  and  humans.  In  recent  studies,  it  has 
been  suggested  that  the HR  gene  is  a  critical  player  in 
the  regulation  of  the  hair  cycle  and,  thus,  HF  develop-
ment.  Furthermore,  the HR  gene  is  associated  with  the 
Wnt  signaling  pathway,  which  regulates  proliferation  and 
differentiation  of  cells  and  plays  an  essential  role  in  hair 
and  skin  development.  In  this  review,  we  summarize  the 
mutations  responsible  for  human  hair  disorders  and  dis-
cuss  the  roles  of  the  HR  gene  in  HF  development.

Introduction

The  hair  follicle  (HF)  is  a  small  independent  organ  of  the 
skin  that  undergoes  regenerative  cycling  for  normal  hair 
formation.  HF  formation  during  embryogenesis  and  re-
generative  cycling  periods  occurs  through  close  cross-
talk  between  epithelial  and  mesenchymal  cells  (Millar, 
2002).  HF  cycling  is  composed  of  the  growth  phase 
(anagen),  regressing  phase  (catagen),  and  resting  phase 
(telogen)  (Paus  et al.,  2004). 
    The  HF,  a  complex  skin  appendage,  is  composed  of 
many  different  compartments,  including  the  sebaceous

mouse  Hr  gene  is  expressed  mainly  in  the  brain  and 
skin,  with  minor  expression  elsewhere  (Cachon-Gonzalez 
et al.,  1994;  Cachon-Gonzalez  et al.,  1999). 
    In  this  review,  we  will  summarize  the  molecular  char-
acteristics  of  the  Hr  gene,  the  roles  of  the  Hr  gene  in 
HF  development,  and  the  mutations  that  are  responsible 
for  human  hair  disorders.

HR,  a  Corepressor  of  Nuclear  Recep-
tors

The  HR  acts  as  a  transcriptional  corepressor  through  in-
teraction  with  nuclear  receptors.  Nuclear  receptors  regu-
late  the  expression  of  specific  genes  as  transcription 
factors  in  developmental  processes  and  other  various 
physiological  processes.  Typically,  nuclear  receptors  ac-
tivate  the  transcription  of  target  genes  through  binding 
to  their  ligands,  such  as  steroid  hormone,  thyroid  hor-
mone,  and  other  small  molecules,  including  retinoic 
acids  and  vitamin  D.  In  some  cases,  nuclear  receptors 
repress  transcription  in  the  absence  of  their  ligands 
(Jepsen et al.,  2002;  Mangelsdorf et al.,  1995;  Privalsky, 
2004;  Smith  et al.,  2004),  and  this  repression  occurs 
through  association  with  its  corepressors,  such  as  nu-
clear  receptor  corepressor  (N-CoR),  silencing  mediator 
for  retinoic  acid  and  thyroid  hormone  receptors  (SMRT), 
and  HR  (Chen et al.,  1995;  Horlein et al.,  1995;  Sande., 
1996;  Thompson  et al.,  2006;  Zhongjian  et al.,  2006). 
HR  has  been  shown  to  interact  with  thyroid  hormone  re-
ceptor  (TR),  retinoic  acid  orphan  receptor  α (RORα), 
and  vitamin  D  receptor  (VDR)  (Thompson,  1996;  Hsieh 
et al.,  2003;  Moraitis  et al.,  2002).

Interaction  with  the  thyroid  hormone  receptor 
and  retinoic  acid  orphan  receptor-α

    TR  is  a  receptor  for  thyroid  hormone,  which  is  an  es-
sential  component  of  development  of  the  central  nerv-
ous  system  (CNS),  and  functions  as  a  transcription  fac-
tor  that  regulates  the  expression  of  target  genes  in  re-
sponse  to  thyroid  hormone  binding.  The  interaction  be-
tween  HR  and  TR  was  found  in  a  yeast  two-hybrid 
screen  for  HR-interacting  proteins,  and  its  interaction 
was  reduced  in  the  presence  of  thyroid  hormone  (Thom-
pson  et al.,  1997).  In vitro  biochemical  assays  and  in 
vivo  coimmunoprecipitation  experiments  have  demon-
strated  that  hr  has  two  independent  TR-interacting  do-
mains  (TR-ID)-TR-ID1  and  TR-ID2  span  amino  acids 
816-830  and  1026-1038  of  the  rat hr  gene,  respectively 
(Fig.  2).  These  TR-ID  domains  of  HR  contain  a  con-
sensus  sequence,  a  stretch  of  hydrophobic  residues: 
I/LIXXL/VV.  This  essential  motif  is  similar  to  those  of 
other  corepressors,  such  as  N-CoR  and  SMRT  (Potter et

domains  (yellow:  RD1,  236-450;  RD2,  750-864;  RD3,  864- 
981);  ROR-interacting  domains  (green:  ROR-ID1,  586-590; 
ROR-ID2,  778-782);  TR-interacting  domains  (red:  TR-ID1, 
816-830;  TR-ID2,  1026-1038);  VDR-interacting  domains  (over-
laps  with  RD3,  750-864).  ZF  indicates  zinc-finger  domain 
(621-646)  (Thompson,  2009).

al.,  2001;  Potter  et al.,  2002;  Thompson  et al.,  1997). 
    Deletion  mapping  of HR  revealed  three  repression  do-
mains  (RD)  that  span  amino  acids  236-450  (RD1),  568- 
864  (RD2),  and  864-981  (RD3)  (Fig.  2).  The  repression 
activity  usually  occurs  through  interaction  with  histone 
deacetylases  (HDACs)  (Burke  et al.,  2000;  Glass  et al., 
2000;  Pazin et al.,  1997).  The  HR  protein  interacts  with 
several  HDACs,  including  HDACs  1,  3,  and  5,  and  the 
repression  activity  of  HR is  reduced  on  treatment  with 
HDAC  inhibitors.  Furthermore,  HR localizes  in  the  nu-
clear  matrix-associated  deacetylase  body,  which  com-
prises  corepressors  and  HDAC  complexes  (Potter et al., 
2001;  Potter et al.,  2002,  Downes et al.,  2000).  This  evi-
dence  suggests  that  HR  may  contribute  to  brain  or  CNS 
development  through  TR,  acting  as  a  transcriptional  co-
repressor.
    The  HR  protein  interacts  with  another  nuclear  re-
ceptor,  RORα,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  cer-
ebellar  development,  lipid  metabolism,  and  neoplasia 
(Gigue're., 1999; Moraitis et al., 2003). HR binds to RORα 
using  two  interaction  motifs,  containing  an  LXXLL  con-
sensus  sequence,  and  represses  transcriptional  activa-
tion  by  RORα  (Moraitis  et al.,  2002).  Cotransfection 
analysis  revealed  that  HR represses  transcriptional  acti-
vation  by  all  ROR  isoforms-α,  β,  and  γ.  Interestingly, 
the  repression  activity  of  RORα by  HR is  dependent  on 
two  LXXLL  motifs,  as  mutations  in  these  motifs  abol-
ished  repression  activity  by  HR,  while  these  mutations 
did  not  affect  the  repression  activity  of  TR  by  HR 
(Moraitis  et al.,  2002).

Interaction  with  the  vitamin  D  receptor

Although  HR interacts  with  TR  and  RORα,  this  is  not 
enough  to  explain  the  skin  phenotype  in  HR mutants, 
because  there  is  no  evidence  that  defects  in  these  re-
ceptors  cause  a  phenotype  that  is  as  striking  as  the 
complete  hair  loss  that  is  observed  in  HR  mutants 
(Alonso et al,  2003).  On  the  other  hand,  mutants  with  a 
deletion  in  the  VDR  manifest  a  hair  loss  phenotype, 

A  Gene  Responsible  for  the  Hairless  Phenotype  in  Mouse  and  Human    95

which  resembles  that  of HR mutant  in  mice  and  humans 
(Li  et al.,  1997;  Yoshizawa  et al.,  1997).
    The  VDR  not  only  mediates  signals  of  1,  25-dihydrox-
yvitamin  D3  (1,25(OH)2D3)  but  also  acts  as  a  tran-
scription  factor,  even  in  the  absence  of  vitamin  D.  Tar-
geted  gene  deletion  studies  revealed  that  VDR  is  asso-
ciated  with  multiple  biological  processes,  especially  the 
progression  of  the  normal  hair  cycle  in  mammalian  skin 
(Yoshizawa  et al.,  1997;  Li  et al.,  1997;  Malloy  et al., 
1999;  Hirst et al.,  1985;  Hughes et al.,  1988;  Rut et al., 
1994). 
    VDR  regulates  gene  expression  by  forming  a  hetero-
dimer  with  RXR  and  binding  to  a  vitamin  D-responsive 
element  in  target  genes.  As  a  partner  of  the  heterodimer 
of  VDR,  RXRα is  relevant  for  hair  cycling,  since  condi-
tional  inactivation  of  RXRα in  mice  caused  alopecia,  as 
in  VDR-null  mice  (Li et al.,  2000).  GST  pull-down  assays 
revealed  that HR interacts  with  VDR  protein in vitro,  and 
this  interaction  is  unaffected  by  the  1,25(OH)2D3  ligand. 
Coimmunoprecipitation  experiments  also  showed  an  in-
teraction  between  HR  and  VDR  in  mammalian  cells 
(Hsieh  et al.,  2003).  The  interaction  domain  of  HR for 
VDR  overlaps  with  the  interaction  domains  for  TR  and 
RORα (Fig.  2),  and  the  minimal  amino  acid  region  was 
mapped  to  750-864  (RD2)  of  HR (Hsieh  et al.,  2003). 
The  transcriptional  repression  of  VDR  by  HR occurs 
both  in  the  presence  and  absence  of  its  ligand,  vitamin 
D,  which  is  different  from  that  of  TR,  in  that  HR medi-
ates  repression  only  by  unliganded  TR  (Potter  et al., 
2001;  Hsieh et al.,  2003).  In  humans,  HR interacts  with 
VDR  and  represses  the  reporter  activity  of  its  target 
genes,  such  as  involucrin,  transglutaminase,  PLC-γ1, 
and  24-hydroxylase,  in  human  keratinocytes  (Zhongjjan 
et al.,  2006). In situ  hybridization  assay  revealed  that HR 
and  VDR  mRNA  colocalize  in  a  subset  of  cells  in  murine 
HFs,  including  the  matrix  and  ORS  (Hsieh et al.,  2003). 
Immunostaining  showed  that  both  nuclear  proteins  are 
colocalized  in  a  subset  of  HF  cells  in  human  skin 
(Zhongjjan  et al.,  2006).  These  results  support  the  bio-
chemically  defined  evidence  of  an  interaction  between 
HR and  VDR  in vivo  in  mouse  and  human  skin. 

Regulation  of  Hair  Cycle  and  Hair  Folli-
cle  Structure

Mutant  mice  of  hairless  gene
Mouse  models  of  various  Hr mutations,  such  as  Hrhr, 
Hrrh,  and  Hrm1Enu,  have  been  actively  studied  to  under-
stand  the  pathophysiology  of  human  hair  loss  disorders 
(Cachon  et al.,  1994;  Ahmad  et al.,  1998c;  Panteleyev 
et al.,  1998;  Nam  et al.,  2006).  Homozygous  mutant 
mice  with  autosomal  recessive  mutations  in  Hr display 

a  distinct  phenotype  with  strikingly  similar  patterns  of 
hair  loss.  These  mutant  mice  grow  hair  normally  in  the 
postnatal  stages;  however,  they  shed  hair  progressively 
from  the  eyelids  to  the  hind  limbs  and  subsequently  de-
velop  alopecia  by  the  third  week  of  postnatal  life.  Addi-
tionally,  targeted  disruption  of Hr also  causes  a  hair  loss 
phenotype,  which  is  restored  by  the  expression  of  HR 
in  keratinocytes  (Beaudoin et al.,  2005;  Thompson et al., 
2006).  In  Hrhr mice,  apoptotic  cell  death  in  HFs  is  ob-
served  in  the  transition  stages  from  the  catagen  to  ana-
gen,  suggesting  that  HR may  play  a  role  in  regulating 
the  HF  growth  cycle  (Panteleyev  et al.,  1999). 
    Mutant  mice  with  a  loss  of  function  in Hr display  the 
hair  loss  phenotype,  which  suggests  that  null  or  a  lack 
of  functional  HR causes  the  hair  loss  phenotype.  Re-
cently,  it  was  shown  that  dysregulation  of  HR expres-
sion  also  causes  the  hair  loss  phenotype.  The  ‘hairpoor’ 
(HrHp)  and  Naked  (HrN)  mice  display  a  different  hair  loss 
phenotype  from  those  reported  in  mice  with  a  loss- 
of-function  mutation  in  HR  (Baek  et al.,  2009).  The 
HrHp/+  mouse  has  short  and  sparse  hair  at  early  ages 
but  gradually  lose  hair  and  become  almost  bald  at  age 
40  weeks,  while  homozygote  (HrHp/HrHp)  mice  are  born 
Hairless  and  stay  naked  (Baek  et al.,  2009).  We  found 
that  this  HrHp mouse  harbors  a  mutation  in  the  5'  un-
translated  region  (UTR)  of  the  Hr gene,  and  it  causes 
overexpression  of  HR protein  (Baek et al.,  2009;  Kim et 
al.,  2010).  This  evidence  has  revealed  that  both  loss- 
and  gain-of-function  mutations  in Hr cause  the  hair  loss 
phenotype,  which  suggests  that  expressional  regulation 
of Hr is  critical  for  maintenance  of  the  hair  cycle  or  de-
velopment  of  HF.

Regulation  of  hair  follicle  structure

Keratins  are  critical  components  of  the  HF.  The  hair 
shaft  is  highly  keratinized  tissue,  and  its  major  compo-
nents  are  hair  keratins  (Langbein et al.,  2005).  The  kera-
tins  are  divided  into  two  types-type  I  and  type  II-and 
their  heterodimerization  forms  intermediate  filaments  that 
provide  resilience  to  hair.  Keratin  is  produced  by  kerati-
nocytes,  which  multiply  and  differentiate.  While  some 
keratinocytes  become  epithelial  cells  of  the  ORS  and 
IRS,  some  become  elongated  to  form  the  hair  shaft 
(Coulombe et al.,  2002;  Moll et al.,  2008).  Epithelial  ker-
atins  are  widely  expressed  in  the  ORS  and  IRS  of  the 
HF  (Langbein  et al.,  2003;  Langbein  et al.,  2001).
    Keratin  expression  is  regulated  by  several  signaling 
pathways  and  transcription  factors,  such  as  Lef1  (a  key 
transcription  factor  in  Wnt  signaling),  Msx2,  Foxn1,  and 
Hoxc13  (DasGupta et al.,  1999;  Merrill et al.,  2001;  Ma 
et al.,  2003;  Schlake  et al.,  2000;  Tkatchenko  et al., 
2001).  Recently,  we  found  that  HR regulates  the  ex-

96    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(3)  93-101,  September  2011

pression  of  keratins  that  reside  in  the  IRS.  The  IRS 
forms  its  structure  by  obligate  heterodimerization  of 
specified  keratins.  Type  I  IRS  keratin  genes  (ie,  Krt25, 
Krt27,  and Krt28)  and  the  type  II  IRS  keratin  gene Krt71 
have  been  identified  as  specifically  expressed  in  the  IRS 
and  are  known  to  support  the  structures  of  the  IRS  cu-
ticle,  Huxley's  layer,  and  Henle’s  layer  (Runkel  et al., 
2006;  Tanaka  et al.,  2007).  We  observed  that  the  ex-
pression  of Krt25, Krt27, Krt28, Krt71,  and Tchh  is  con-
sistently  affected  by  HR,  both  in vivo  and  in vitro  (in 
submission).  These  results  suggest  that  HR affects  the 
formation  of  the  HF  through  regulation  of  keratin  ex-
pression  in  the  IRS.

Association  with  the  Wnt  Signaling  Path-
way
Wnt/β-catenin  signaling  plays  a  crucial  role  not  only  in 
HF  morphogenesis  but  also  in  the  regeneration  of  the 
HF  through  regulation  of  anagen  initiation  in  the  adult 
hair  cycle  (Ahmad  et al.,  1998c;  Huelsken  et al.,  2001; 
Beaudoin et al.,  2005;  Stenn et al.,  2001).  The  β-cate-
nin  protein,  a  key  molecule  of  the  Wnt  signaling  path-
way,  is  activated  and  translocated  into  the  nucleus 
when  a  Wnt  protein  binds  to  its  receptor,  Frizzled.  In  the 
nucleus,  β-catenin  forms  a  complex  with  Lef1/Tcf  tran-
scription  factors  and  regulates  target  gene  expression 
(Huelsken et al.,  2001).  Inactivation  of  Wnt  signaling  oc-
curs  through  its  inhibitors,    and  keratinocyte  cells,  in-
family,  Sclerostin  do-
cluding 
main-containing protein 1 (Sostdc1), Wnt inhibitory fac-
tor 1 (Wif1), and  the Secreted frizzled-related protein 
(Sfrp)  family  (Kawano  et al.,  2003).

Transcriptional  regulation  of  Wnt  signaling  in-
hibitors

The  fact  that  induction  of  HR protein  using  transgenic 
systems  rescues  the Hairless  phenotype  of  HR-null  mice 
reveals  that  HR functions  in  progenitor  keratinocytes 
and  induces  the  hair  cycle,  thus  allowing  HF  regener-
ation  (Beaudoin et al.,  2005).  This  suggests  that  HR may 
regulate  the  Wnt  signaling  pathway,  since  this  signaling 
directly  regulates  HF  regeneration  (Zarach  et al.,  2004; 
Beaudoin et al.,  2005;  Lo  Celso et al., 2004).  Gene  ex-
pression  profiling  of Hr knockout  and Hr-rescued  trans-
genic  mice  have  revealed  that  the  Wnt-responsive  gene 
Axin2  is  regulated  by  HR,  which  suggests  that  HR can 
promote  the  Wnt  signaling  pathway.  In  addition,  the  HR 
overexpression  mouse HrHp  shows  increased  expression 
of Myc and Ccnd1,  target  genes  of  Wnt  signaling  (Kim 
et al.,  2010).  As  expected,  the  Wnt  inhibitors Wise  and 
Soggy  are  upregulated  in Hr knockout  mice  and  down-

regulated  in  HR-rescued  transgenic  skin,  showing  an  in-
verse  relationship  with  HR expression in vivo  (Beaudoin 
et al.,  2005;  Thompson et al.,  2006).  Furthermore, Sfrp2 
mRNA  expression  is  downregulated  in HrHp  mouse  skin 
(Kim  et al.,  2010).  A  promoter  analysis  has  suggested 
that  the  regulation  of  Wnt  inhibitor  expression  is  regu-
lated  by  HR specifically,  because  there  is  no  such  regu-
lation  that  is  detected  by  another  corepressor,  SMRT 
(Beaudoin  et al.,  2005;  Thompson  et al.,  2006).  These 
findings  suggest  that  HR can  modulate  more  than  one 
regulator  in  the  Wnt  signaling  pathway,  and  it  appears 
to  be  crucial  that  the  timing  and  level  of  HR protein  ex-
pression  are  tightly  regulated  for  normal  HF  develop-
ment.  Regulation  of  Wnt  signaling  by  HR is  one  compo-
nent  of  the  complex  interactions  of  signaling  pathways 
in  HF  cycling.  HR may  regulate  the  expression  of  genes 
that  modulate  other  signaling  pathways,  such  as  Shh, 
BMP,  and  TGF-β,  which  regulate  HF  morphogenesis 
and  cycling.

Genetic  Hair  Disorders  with  HR  Muta-
tion

Atrichia  with  papular  lesions  and  Alopecia  uni-
versalis  congenita

Atrichia  with  popular  lesions  (APL;  MIM  209500)  is  a 
rare  autosomal  recessive  disorder.  Patients  are  born 
with  natal  hair,  which  falls  out  in  the  first  few  months 
of  life  and  never  replenishes.  In  addition  to  the  complete 
absence  of  any  hair,  including  scalp  hair,  eyebrows, 
eyelashes,  and  pubic  hair,  they  also  develop  papular 
eruptions  on  the  scalp,  cheeks,  elbows,  arms,  knees, 
and  thighs.  Histological  examination  of  a  patient’s  skin 
has  revealed  the  absence  of  HFs  (Ahmad et al.,  1998a; 
Henn  et al.,  2002;  Sprecher  et al.,  1999). 
    A  similar  hair  disorder  as  APL,  alopecia  universalis 
congenita  (ALUNC;  MIM  203655)  also  manifests  as  a 
lack  of  body  hair  without  papular  lesions  and  has  been 
found  to  be  caused  by  mutations  in  the  HR gene.  A 
skin  biopsy  of  one  patient  revealed  that  there  were  few 
HFs  present,  without  hair  in  them  (Ahmad et al.,  1998b). 
Multiple  kinds  of  mutations  of  the  human HR gene  with 
a  loss  of  function  have  been  reported  (Table  1).
    As  a  model  for  APL,  we  and  others  have  reported 
hairless  mutant  mice  that  have  a  similar  phenotype  as 
APL.  Histological  analyses  have  revealed  that  they  show 
an  absence  of  HFs  and  the  formation  of  abnormal 
structures,  such  as  utricles  and  dermal  cysts,  in  the  skin 
(Ahmad  et al.,  1998c;  Panteleyev  et al.,  1998;  Nam  et 
al.,  2006;  Zarach et al.,  2004;  Sundberg,  1994).  APL  is 
also  caused  by  recessive  mutations  in  the VDR  gene,  as

(VDDR2A;  OMIM  277440)  patient  (Miller  et al.,  2001). 
This  suggests  that  there  is  a  functional  relationship  be-
tween  HR and  VDR  in  controlling  postnatal  cycling  of 
the  HF,  as  mentioned  above. 

Marie  Unna  hereditary  hypotrichosis

Autosomal  dominant  Marie  Unna  hereditary  hypotri-
chosis  (MUHH;  MIM  146550)  is  characterized  by  abnor-
mal  hair  density  in  the  scalp,  eyebrows,  eyelashes,  and 
body.  Affected  individuals  are  born  with  sparse  hair  that 
is  characteristically  coarse,  wiry,  and  twisted  in  early 
childhood  and  progress  to  complete  baldness  (Argenzia-

no  et al.,  1999;  Unna.,  1925;  Ludwig.,  1953).  Although 
genetic  heterogeneity  has  been  reported  in  Dutch,  Bel-
gian,  British,  French,  German,  and  Chinese  families,  the 
majority  of  MUHH  pedigrees  has  been  linked  to  chro-
mosome  8p21,  near  the  HR gene  (Sreekumar  et al., 
2000;  van  Steensel  et al.,  1999;  Lefevre  et al.,  2000; 
Cichon et al.,  2000;  Yan et al.,  2004;  He et al.,  2004). 
In  addition  to  the  characteristic  sparse  hair  phenotype 
at  birth,  MUHH  is  different  from  other HR defect-asso-
ciated  disorders,  in  that  it  is  inherited  in  a  dominant 
manner,  whereas  the  other  disorders  are  inherited  in  a 
recessive  mode.  Recently,  13  distinct  mutations  were 
identified  in  patients  with  MUHH.  Interestingly,  all  of 
these  mutations  were  present  in  the  5'  UTR  of HR (Wen 
et al.,  2009),  in  contrast  to  mutations  present  in  the 
coding  sequences  of HR that  result  in  a  loss  of  function. 
We  and  others  have  shown  that  all  of  these  mutations 
upregulate  HR expression  at  the  translational  level  using 
a  reporter  system  (Wen  et al.,  2009;  Kim  et al.,  2010). 
In  fact,  in  an  animal  model,  the HrHp  mouse,  which  has 
a  mutation  located  at  the  same  position  of  the HR gene 
as  in  MUHH,  the  expression  of  HR was  found  to  be 
greatly  increased  compared  with  that  of  wild-type  mice 
(Kim  et al.,  2010).

Conclusion

The  study  of  HR has  suggested  that  HR functions  in  HF 
development  and  cycling.  As  a  transcription  factor,  HR 
regulates  the  expression  of  many  genes  that  are  com-
ponents  of  the  HF  or  key  molecules  of  the  signaling 
pathway  for  hair  cycling  and  HF  maintenance.  There 
may  be  many  more  genes  that  remain  to  be  discovered 
as  targets  of  HR  in  the  skin.  Identification  of  them  will 
greatly  facilitate  the  elucidation  of  the  biological  func-
tions  of  HR  in  developmental  processes  and  the  molec-
ular  mechanisms  of  HF  cycling.  The  HF  is  a  very  dy-
namic  organ,  with  continuous  regeneration  throughout 
an  organism’s  life,  and  the  presence  and  behaviors  of 
its  stem  cells  are  only  recently  slowly  being  uncovered. 
Since  HR  associates  with  Wnt  signaling,  which  is  an  es-
sential  pathway  for  stem  cell  function,  and  is  expressed 
in  ORS  cells,  which  are  the  same  lineage  as  bulge  cells, 
the  elucidation  of  HR  function  in  HF  stem  cells  will  be 
required.  Further  study  of  HR  function  in  HF  cycling  as 
well  as  in  stem  cell  biology  will  provide  a  better  under-
standing  of  HF  development  and  may  help  us  under-
stand  the  development  of  other  HR-expressing  tissues, 
such  as  brain.
