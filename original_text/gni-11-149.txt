Liver  enzyme  elevations,  as  an  indicator  of  liver  function,  are  widely  associated  with  metabolic  diseases.  Genome-wide 
population-based association studies have identified a genetic susceptibility to liver enzyme elevations and their related 
traits; however, the genetic architecture in childhood remains largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide association 
study to identify new genetic loci for liver enzyme levels in a Korean childhood cohort (n = 484). We observed three novel loci 
(rs4949718, rs80311637, and rs596406) that were multiply associated with elevated levels of alanine transaminase and 
aspartate transaminase. Although there are some limitations, including genetic power, additional replication and functional 
characterization will support the clarity on the genetic contribution that the ST6GALNAC3, ADAMTS9, and CELF2 genes have 
in childhood liver function.

Introduction

Plasma liver enzyme tests are broadly applied to predict 
biochemical liver functions and to diagnose liver diseases. 
Alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  and  aspartate  transaminase 
(AST) are closely associated with hepatocyte damage and 
steatosis, 
liver  disease 
(NAFLD) [1]. Elevated liver enzyme levels, as prospective 
risk  factors,  have  been  reported  to  be  involved  in  type  2 
diabetes and coronary heart disease [2, 3]. However, alkaline 
phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase are related 
with biliary, cholestatic, and alcoholic diseases [4]. 

including  non-alcoholic  fatty 

Overweightedness  in  childhood  or  adolescence  is  per-
sistent in adulthood obesity and is closely associated with 
adverse health effects, including metabolic diseases [5]. A 
recent cohort study in Korean adolescents has shown strong 

associations  of  liver  enzyme  levels  with  a  cluster  of 
metabolic syndrome components [6]. Thus, finding genetic 
markers  of  liver  enzyme  levels  in  childhood  would  be 
important for early prediction of liver function and its related 
disease in adulthood.

Liver  enzyme  levels  are  affected  by  environmental  and 
genetic factors. The heritabilities of liver enzyme levels range 
from  approximately  35%  to  61%  [7,  8].  To  date,  two 
genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs)  in  European 
ancestry populations have identified genetic variants located 
in multiple genes associated with levels of ALT (HSD17B13- 
MAPK10, TRIB1, CHUK, and SAMM50), AST (NBPF3-ALPL), 
and both of them (CPN1 and PNPLA3) [9, 10]. In addition, a 
meta-analysis identified pleiotropic effects between NAFLD 
and metabolic traits, such as low-density lipoprotein, high- 
density lipoprotein, triglyceride, fasting glucose, and insulin

Despite the identification of novel genes or loci associated 
with  liver  enzymes  in  cohort  populations,  the  common 
variants in childhood are still largely unknown. Here, we 
present  findings  from  a  GWAS  in  childhood  subjects  to 
identify new susceptibility loci for liver enzyme levels. 

Methods 
Study subjects

Students, aged between 8 and 13 years, were recruited 
from Gwacheon City and Kyunggi Province from April to 
June 2010. This study was performed as a part of the Korean 
Children-Adolescents Study (KoCAS), which has been mo-

7 in Gwacheon City or fourth grade at age 10 in Seoul and 
Gyeonggi Province, Korea. Subjects who were enrolled in a 
specific diet program or were taking any medications known 
to affect appetite were excluded from the study. AST and ALT 
levels were measured in the serum of each subject. The study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review board of 
Seoul Paik Hospital, Inje University, and the Korea Center for 
Disease  Control  and  Prevention.  Informed  consent  was 
obtained from the childrens’ parents.

Genotyping and quality control

A total of 532 samples were genotyped using the Illumina 
HumanOmni1-Quad  BeadChip (Illumina  Inc., San  Diego, 
CA, USA). Samples that revealed the following properties 
were excluded: genotyping call ＜ 98%, heterozygosity ＞ 
30%,  sex  inconsistency,  cryptic  first-degree  relative,  or 
duplication. A total of 48 subjects were excluded from the 
sample QC process. Markers with a high missing call rate (＞
5%), minor allele frequency ＜ 0.01, and significant devia-

tion from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p ＜ 1 × 10-6) were 
also  excluded.  The  remaining  747,076  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were used in subsequent analyses 
for association.

Association analyses

Genome-wide association was analyzed using the PLINK 
software (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink). 
The  association  between  genotypes  and  concentration  of 
liver enzymes in plasma was evaluated with linear regression 
analysis, controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) as 
covariates. The Manhattan plots of －log10 (p-value) were 
made using Haploview v. 4.2. The quantile-quantile plots 
were  generated  using  R  statistics  package  to  assess  the 
overall significance of the genome-wide associations.

Results

A total of 747,076 SNP genotype assays were tested on the 
DNA samples of 484 Korean childhood subjects. ALT and

AST  levels  of  the  subjects  according  to  age  and  sex  are 
presented  in  Supplementary  Table  1.  Linear  regression 
analyses were performed to estimate the p-values for the 
association  between  genotype  distributions  and  levels  of 
ALT and AST. Manhattan plots of association analyses of all 
SNPs with respect to ALT and AST are presented with the 
chromosomal positions (X-axis) and negative logarithm of 
p-values  (Y-axis)  of  each  SNP  (Fig.  1).  Quantile-quantile 
plots  comparing  the  association  p-values  with  those  ex-
pected for a null distribution are also presented (Fig. 2). The 
highest-ranked SNPs showing the lowest p-values (p ＜ 1.0 
× 10-5) of association with ALT and AST levels are listed in 
Table  1.  In  addition,  genotype  clusters  of  the  SNPs  are 
presented in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Although  there  was  no  SNP  satisfying  the  criteria  of 
genome-wide significance (p ＜ 1.0 × 10-8), we identified 
three  loci  (rs4949718,  rs80311637,  and  rs596406  in 
ST6GALNAC3,  ADAMTS9,  and  CELF2,  respectively)  that 
were suggestively associated with levels of ALT and AST. Of 
these  SNPs,  rs4949718  was  found  to  be  more  strongly 
associated with ALT levels (p = 1.87 × 10-7) but less in AST 
levels (p = 1.49 × 10-6). The missense rs80311637 (V1597M) 
and intronic rs596406 SNPs were more strongly associated 
with an increased risk of AST than ALT. 

Discussion

The levels of ALT and AST, known as transaminases, are 
important indicators for determining hepatocyte injury or 
hepatocellular diseases. However, ALT is known to be found 
in the highest level in the liver; thus, ALT levels are more 
liver-specific indicators [4]. Moreover, it has been reported 
that  ALT  levels  are  more  significantly  associated  with  a 
cluster of metabolic syndrome than AST levels in a Korean 
adolescent cohort study [6]. 

In  this  study,  we 

identified  three  novel  genes 
(ST6GALNAC3, ADAMTS9, and CELF2) that were multiply 
associated with elevated levels of ALT and AST. Of the three 
loci, rs4949718 in the intron region of ST6GALNAC3 yielded 
the lowest p-value for the association with ALT, compared to 
AST levels (Table 1). In addition, rs80311637 (ADAMTS9) 
and  rs596406  (CELF2)  were  shown  to  be  more  strongly 
associated with AST levels, compared to ALT. These results 
indicate that the liver-specific feature of ALT was not driven 
as the secondary association for AST. In recent, a previous 
GWAS  in  an  Amish  population  identified  two  genetic 
variants (rs17209512 and deletion) in glutamic-oxaloacetic 
transaminase  1  (GOT1)  that  were  associated  with  serum 
AST. However, the rs17209512 SNP, which is in incomplete 
LD with rs76850691, was not replicated in our study (Table 
1).

For the three multiply associated loci, we performed con-
ditional analyses to test whether the association with the 
other trait was simply secondary to the primary association 
(Supplementary Table 2). In these analyses, the association 
signals on rs4949718 for AST and rs80311637 and rs596406 
for ALT were abolished by adjustment of the ALT and AST, 
respectively. It is assumed that the multiple effects of these 
loci on ALT and AST resulted from the secondary effects by 
physiologically  correlated  features  between  ALT  and  AST 
[12].  In  addition,  when  comparing  with  BMI-unadjusted 
data, the association signals in ALT were relatively weaker 
than those of the BMI-adjusted data. However, there was no 
significant difference in p-values before and after adjusting 
for BMI in AST (data not shown).

ST6GALNAC3  encodes  a  type  of  sialyltransferase  that 
plays a role in the transfer of sialic acids from cytidine 5' 
monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic  acid  (CMP-NeuAc)  to 
the  carbohydrate  termini  of  glycoproteins  and  glycolipids 
[13].  Previous  GWASs  have  revealed  the  associations  of 
ST6GALNAC3 SNPs with human electroencephalogram and 
nicotine dependence [14, 15]; however, there has been no 
report on an association with liver enzyme levels. Although 
the  association  with  liver  enzymes  is  still  unknown, 
ST6GALNAC3 has been shown to be associated with sub-
scapular skin-fold thickness, a type of obesity-related trait, in 
a Korean adult population [16]. Obesity affects elevated liver 
enzyme levels by inducing inflammatory responses in the 
liver, accompanied by increases in C- reactive protein [17]. 
The involvements between obesity and liver enzyme levels 
have been found in cohort studies [18-20]. Therefore, the 
association of ST6GALNAC3 with obesity may influence liver 
enzyme levels indirectly. In addition, ST6GALNAC3 protein 
interacts with α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG), 
which  is  also  known  as  fetuin-A,  by  enzyme-substrate 
specificity [13]. AHSG is abundantly distributed in serum 
protein and is  produced mainly in the liver, and elevated 
levels of this protein are associated with the risk of NAFLD 
[21].  Considering  that  liver  enzyme  levels  are  closely 
involved indicators in NAFLD [22, 23], the interaction with 
AHSG might induce an association between ST6GALNAC3 
and liver enzyme levels.

ADAMTS9  is  a  metalloproteinase  that  plays  a  role  in 
cleavage of proteoglycans and is expressed in skeletal muscle 
and pancreas [24]. ADAMTS9 has been reported as a type 2 
diabetes susceptibility region in a GWAS [24]. This gene has 
also shown an association with insulin resistance and im-
paired beta-cell function in the pancreas [25]. Taken toge-
ther, the association of ADAMTS9 with liver enzymes might 
be due to its susceptibility to diabetes and insulin resistance.
CELF2 (also known as CUGBP2) induces the skipping of 
exon 11 of insulin receptor (IR). The mRNA expression level 

152

www.genominfo.org

of exon-skipped IR is significantly lower in liver than in other 
organs in mouse models [26]. It has been reported that a 
decrease  in  the  number  of  IRs  on  target  cells  can  cause 
insulin resistance [27]. Therefore, it is assumed that CELF2 
affects liver enzyme levels by lowering expression of IR in 
liver that induces insulin resistance.

In  summary,  our data  demonstrate  new  multiple asso-
ciations  with  ALT  and  AST  levels  in  a  Korean  childhood 
cohort. Further replication and functional studies remain to 
be done to clarify the genetic factors of liver dysfunction.
