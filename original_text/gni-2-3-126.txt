Abstract 
T helper-type 2 cytokines,  such  as  IL-4 and  IL-13,  may 
play  a  central  role  in  allergic  diseases.  The  protein 
known  as  signal 
transducers  and  activators  of 
transcription  6  (STAT6)  is  a  key  transcription  factor 
involved  in  both  IL-4- and  -13-mediated  biological 
responses.  Two  polymorphisms  of  the  STAT  6  gene 
(exon  1  and  G2964A  variant)  have  been  found.  We 
investigated whether these ST AT6 gene polymorphisms 
were associated with allergic rhinitis.  Blood samples for 
genetic analysis were obtained from 285 individuals with 
allergic  rhinitis  and  from  271  healthy  subjects  without 
atopic disease. The G2964A variant of the STAT6 gene 
was  genotyped  using  PCR-RFLP  analysis.  The  GT 
repeat polymorphism in exon 1 of the STAT6 gene was 
genotyped  by 
fragment  analysis.  There  was  no 
association  between  the  2964A variant and  GT repeat 
polymorphism in exon 1 of the ST AT6 and allergic rhinitis 
in  a  Korean  population  (both  p  >  0.05).  Our  results 
suggest that a combination of STAT6 gene polyrnorphisms 
is not a useful marker for predicting allergic rhinitis.

As  allergic  diseases  are  multifactorial  diseases,  the 
development of allergic rhinitis appears to be determined 
by the interaction between genetics and  environmental 
exposure. 
IL-13  have  been

atopy. These cytokines are produced by T helper (Th) 2 
cells and are capable of inducing isotype class-switching 
of 8 cells to produce lgE(Howard eta/., 2001).  IL-4 and 
-13  share  the  IL-4  receptor  a  chain  as  a  common 
receptor  component  and  have  similar  biological 
properties(Callard eta/., 1997). 

Signal  transducers  and  activators  of  transcription 
(STAT) proteins are a family of transcription factors that 
mediate  many cytokine-induced  responses(lhle,  1995). 
STAT6 is involved in the IL-4 and -13 signaling pathway, 
two cytokines that are related to allergic diseases(Lin et 
a/., 1995). STAT6-deficient (STAT6+) mice fait to develop 
IL-4-mediated  functions,  including  Th2  differentiation, 
the  expression  of  cell  surface  markers,  and  lg  class 
switching  to  lgE  (Kapan  eta/.,  1996;  Shimoda  eta/., 
1996). This finding demonstrates that STAT6 activation 
is  involved  in  IL-4- and  IL-13-mediated disorders,  such 
as allergy. 

The human STAT6 gene,  which  is approximately 19 
kb  long,  is  located at 12q13.3-q14.1  and consists of 23 
exons(Patel eta/., 1998). Exon 1 of the STAT6 gene is a 
non-coding  region  with  GT  repeat  polymorphism  that 
might  play  an  important  role  in  mRNA  expression  or 
mRNA stability(Tamura  eta/.,  2001).  If  the  GT  repeat 
polymorphism 
influences  such  regulatory  elements 
directly  or  indirectly,  the  consequence  would  be  the 
abnormal translation of the ST AT6 mRNA(Duetsch eta/,. 
2002).  Recent  studies  identified  the  polymorphisms  of 
exon  1  and  a  G2964A  variant  of  the  ST AT6  gene  in 
allergic subjects (Tamura eta/., 2001; Gao eta/., 2000; 
Tamura eta/., 2003). Therefore,  we tested whether the 
STAT6 gene polymorphisms are associated with allergic 
rhinitis

association  between  total  serum  lgE  levels  and  blood 
eosinophil counts and the ST AT6 gene polymorph isms 
with allergic rhinitis. 

in  Korea.  And  we  also 

investigated 

Materials and Methods 
The distribution  of the  ST AT6  gene was  determined in 
271  healthy subjects  (138 men and  133 women;  mean 
age,  28.6  ±  8.5  years)  and  285  patients  with  allergic 
rhinitis (149 men and 136 women; mean age, 26.9 ± 12.3 
years).  The  patients  visited  our  outpatient  clinic  at 
Wonkwang University Hospital. The diagnosis of allergic 
rhinitis  was  based  on  clinical  symptoms  of  sneezing,

watery rhinorrhea,  congestion,  and a positive skin-prick 
test  or  multiple  allergen  simultaneous  test  (MAST 
lmmunosystems, CA,  USA). Six common aeroallergens 
were  tested:  house  dust  mites  (Oermatophagoides 
farinae,  Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus),  house dust, 
grass  mix  (Bermuda  and  Timothy  grass),  tree  pollens 
(box  elder,  hazelnut,  poplar  mix,  ash  mix,  cedar,  and 
birch),  animal  fur  extracts  (cat  and  dog  dander),  and 
molds  (Alternaria,  Cladosporium,  and Aspergillus spp.). 
All  of  the  patients diagnosed with  allergic  rhinitis  had  a 
history of  all  of the  symptoms and  at  least one  positive 
allergy  test.  We  carefully  selected  healthy  control 
subjects.  A  detailed  questionnaire  was  used  to  select 
subjects  who  had  no  family  history  of  atopy.  All  of  the 
control subjects were negative for allergic symptoms and 
had negative results on allergy testing. Informed consent 
was obtained from all of the patients and control subjects, 
and  the  protocols  were  approved  by the  Committee  of 
Ethics,  Faculty of Medicine, Wonkwang University. 

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. 
The dinucleotide repeat polymorphism of the first exon of 
the  ST AT6  gene  was  genotyped  as  previously 
described(Tamura eta/., 2001 ).  The G2964A variant of 
the STAT6 gene was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. PCR 
primer  sets  were  designed 
fragments 
containing each polymorphism. 

to  amplify 

PCR was performed  in a volume of 20 pi  containing 
50 ng of genomic DNA,  125 pmol of each dNTP,  1 U of 
Taq polymerase,  Taq buffer, and 10 pmol of the forward 
and reverse primers. For STAT6 exon 1, a 6-FAM-labled 
forward  primer  was  used.  The  cycle  conditions  were 
95°C for 5 min, and then 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 62°C 
(STAT6 exon 1) or 55°C (G2964A variant) for 30 s,  and 
72°C for 40 s,  with  a final  7 min  at 72°C,  in a PTC-200 
Peltier-effect thermal cycler (MJ  Research, MA,  USA). 

The 285 subjects with allergic rhinitis and 271  controls 
were genotyped in terms of the GT repeat polymorphism in 

ex on 1 of the ST AT6 gene. After PCR, 1 p, I of the products 
plus  0.5  p,l  of  the  GeneScan  500  ROX  size  standard 
(Applied Biosystems,  Warrington,  UK)  were denatured in 
12  p,l  of  formamide  and  separated 
in  an  Applied 
Biosystems  Prism Genetic Analyzer  (ABI  PRISM  31 00) 
with  POP4  polymer;  then  the  fragment  lengths  were 
determined. The polymorphic PCR products were classified 
into four alleles: A 1 (352 bp,  13GT repeats) to A4 (358 bp, 
16GT repeats) (Table 1 ). The forward and reverse primers 
used for ST AT6 exon  1 were 5'gagggggacagagtaagtggg3' 
and 5'gctagcacctcccccctt3', respectively. 

rM 

The G2964A polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region 
of  the  STAT6  gene  (NCBI  SNP  Cluster  ID:  rs324015) 
was  determined  by  PCR and  the amplification- created 
restriction site method according to Amoli  et a/(Amoli  et 
a/.,  2000).  The forward  and  reverse  primers  used  were 
5'gaagttcaggctctgagac3'  and  5'ccatcaccctcagagagc3', 
respectively.  The  PCR  product  of  the  93-bp  band  was 
mixed with 3 U of BsaHI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, 
MA,  USA)  and  the  reaction  buffer,  according  to  the 
manufacturer's  instructions.  The  digestion  with  BsaHI 
yielded 7 4- and 19-bp fragments when there was a G at 
position 2964. The reaction was incubated at 3JCC for 5 
h;  10 •  I of the product was loaded onto a 4.5% agarose 
gel  containing  ethidium  bromide,  for  electrophoresis. 
Individuals homozygous for the rare allele (allele 2964A) 
yielded  one  uncut  band  (93  bp).  The  2964G  allele 
yielded two bands of 7 4 and  19 bp. 

Serum  levels  of total  lgE were determined by  using 
the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (E170, Roche 
Diagnostics  GmbH,  Mannheim,  Germany).  Eosinophil 
values were determined by the eosinophil  numbers per 
total  cell  numbers  per  p.Q  . A  reading  of  more than  100 
IU/mL  total  lgE  was  considered  as  atopy.  The  normal 
range of blood eosinophil counts was 40-500/p.Q. 

The genotypes and  allele frequencies  of the ST AT6 
gene  polymorphisms  in  the  controls  and  patients  were

compared  using  Pearson's  two-tailed  chi-squared  test 
(SPSS  10.0,  SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL).  The  standard 
analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  test  for  quantitative  traits 
was used to compare levels of serum total  lgE and blood 
eosinophil counts. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
was determined using the x 2  goodness-of-fit test. 

Results 
The  distribution  of  the  GT  repeat  polymorphism  of 
STAT6 exon 1 is shown in Table 1. The distribution of the 
four  alleles  (13-,  14-,  15-,  and  16GT repeat  alleles)  is 
shown. The 15/15GT genotype occurred most frequently 
in the allergic rhinitis and control groups. The next most 
frequent  was  13/15GT in  both  groups.  Although  these 
two genotypes were more frequent in the control group, 
the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). 
There  was  no  13/17GT  or  16/16GT  genotype  in  the 
allergic  rhinitis  group,  whereas  there  was  no  15/17GT 
genotype  in  the  control  group.  None  of the  GT-repeat 

alleles  of  the  patients  with  allergic  rhinitis  were 
significantly different from those of the control group (p > 
0.05). 

Table 2 shows the distribution of the G2964A variant 
of the ST AT6 gene. The genotypes of the allergic rhinitis 
group were  not significantly different from  those of the 
control  group  (p  >  0.05).  The  mutant  A  allele  was 
predominant in both groups. Moreover, the frequency of 
the  A  allele  in  the  allergic  rhinitis  group  was  not 
significantly different from that of the control  group (p > 
0.05). 

There  was  no  significant  difference  in  either  mean 
total serum lgE levels or blood eosinophil counts between 
the genotype of G2964A of the STAT6 gene (Table 3). 

And also there was no significant difference in mean 
blood eosinophil counts between the distribution of GT 
repeat polymorphism of STAT6 exon 1 (Table 4).

(Edfors-Lubs  eta/.,  1971 ).  The  estimated  heritability of 
allergic diseases is 50-60% based  on  twin  studies and 
segregation analyses( Palmer eta/., 2000). The genetics 
of allergic rhinitis have not been studied as well as those 
of  asthma  and  atopy.  Although  much  effort  has  been 
spent attempting to dissect complex diseases genetically, 
the  genetics  of  these  diseases  seem  to  be  more 
complicated than initially thought. 

in  dizygotic 

Some  genetic  linkages  have  been  demonstrated 
using  molecular markers  located  in  and  around  genes 
whose  products  are  involved  in  the  pathophysiology of 
atopy or are spread throughout the genome(Bieecker et 
a/.,  1998;  Wilkinson  et  a/.,  1999).  Single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms  are  the  most  common  variation  in  the 
DNA sequence and are present at a frequency of about 1 
in 1 ,000 nucleotides in humans(Kruglyak L eta/., 2001 ). 
Recent studies  reported the linkage and association 
between  two  ST AT6  gene  polymorphisms-the  GT 
repeat polymorphism in  exon  1 and the G2964A variant 
of the STAT6 gene-and allergic diseases(Tamura K et 
a/., 2001; Gao eta/., 2000; Tamura eta/., 2003). Tamura 
eta/. (2001) showed that the genotypes of the 13/15GT 
repeat heterozygosity and 15GT homozygosity in exon 1 
of  ST AT6  were  significantly  associated  with  allergic 
rhinitis.  They  suggested  that  the  dinucleotide  repeat 
polymorphism  identified  in  their  study  represents  a 
marker  mutation,  or  might  be  genetically  linked  to 
another polymorphism associated with the development 
of allergic disease,  such  as  atopic dermatitis,  bronchial 
asthma,  or  food-related  anaphylaxis.  In  a  case-control 
study conducted in  British and Japanese adults,  Gao et 
a/.  (2000)  found  no  association  between  the  STAT6 
2964A variant and  adult asthmatic subjects in  a British 
population,  but  found  an  association  with  adult  atopic 
mild asthmatic subjects in a Japanese population. Two 
different  case-control  studies  of  atopic  asthma  in 
Japanese  populations  found  different  results  for  the 
association  between  this  SNP  and  allergic  diseases 
(Gao  eta/., 2000;  Tamura eta/., 2003). These findings 
suggest  that  there  are  marked  differences  not  only 
between  different  ethnic  groups  but  also  within  one 
ethnic  group,  underlining  the  genetic  heterogeneity  of 
complex  diseases  like  allergic  diseases.  We  found  no 
associations  between  the  2964A  variant  and  the  GT 
repeat  polymorphism  in  exon  1 of  STAT6  and  allergic 
rhinitis  in  a  Korean  population.  Ethnic  differences  are 
well  documented  to  play  a  major  role  in  association

studies,  thus  it  is  important  to  verify  and  identify 
polymorphisms in the particular population under study. 
Several  previous studies  have suggested that there 
are  significant  interethnic  differences  in 
the  allele 
frequencies  of  atopy  predisposition  genotypes  among 
Asians compared with the Caucasian population (Kim et 
a/.,  2004;  Lee  eta/., 2004;  Yao  eta/.,  2003;  Kim  eta/., 
2004).  In  a  recent  study of the  G2964A variant,  the  G 
allele was dominant in Caucasians( Gao eta/., 2000). By 
contrast,  the A allele was dominant in  our (Korean) and 
another (Japanese)  (Gao  eta/., 2000) study population 
(i.e.,  Korean:  57%,  Japanese:  67%,  Caucasian:  24%). 
These findings  suggest genetic heterogeneity between 
Asian and Western populations. 

An  elevated  total  serum  lgE  is  seen  in  disorders 
related to atopy,  such  as asthma and allergic rhinitis.  A 
genetic linkage has been reported between the totallgE 
level and the region on  chromosome 5q31-33 encoding 
a  cluster  of  cytokine  genes  (Meyers  eta/.,  1994).  We 
investigated  the  relationships  between  the  eosinophil 
count and total serum immunoglobulin E (lgE) level and 
the genotypes of the GT repeat polymorphism in exon 1 
and  the  G2964A variant  of the  ST AT6  gene  in  allergic 
rhinitis  patients,  but  could  not  find  any  significant 
associations. To the best of our knowledge, this report is 
the first study of STAT6 gene polymorphisms in allergic 
rhinitis in a Korean population. Our results indicate that a 
combination of STAT6 gene polymorphisms may not be 
a useful marker for predicting allergic rhinitis in a Korean 
population. Larger, population-based studies are necessary 
to  confirm  the  association  of  this  genetic  marker  with 
allergic  rhinitis

understanding  of  allergic  disease-specific  genes,  their 
expression,  and

Conclusions 
T helper-type 2 cytokines,  such  as  IL-4 and  IL-13,  may 
play  a  central  role  in  allergic  diseases.  The  protein 
known  as  signal 
transducers  and  activators  of 
transcription  6  (STAT6)  is  a  key  transcription  factor 
involved  in  both 
I L -4- and  -13-mediated  biological 
responses.  Two  polymorphisms  of  the  STAT  6  gene 
(exon  1  and  G2964A  variant)  have  been  found.  Our 
results  indicate  that  a  combination  of  STAT6  gene 
polymorph isms may not be a useful marker for predicting 
allergic rhinitis in a Korean population.
