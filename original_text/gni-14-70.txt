Transposable elements are one of major sources to cause genomic instability through various mechanisms including de novo 
insertion,  insertion-mediated  genomic  deletion,  and  recombination-associated  genomic  deletion.  Among  them  is  Alu 

element  which  is  the  most  abundant  element,  composing ∼10%  of  the  human  genome.  The  element  emerged  in  the 

primate genome 65 million years ago and has since propagated successfully in the human and non-human primate genomes. 
Alu element is a non-autonomous retrotransposon and therefore retrotransposed using L1-enzyme machinery. The ‘master 
gene’ model has been generally accepted to explain Alu element amplification in primate genomes. According to the model, 
different subfamilies of Alu elements are created by mutations on the master gene and most Alu elements are amplified from 
the hyperactive master genes. Alu element is frequently involved in genomic rearrangements in the human genome due to 
its abundance and sequence identity between them. The genomic rearrangements caused by Alu elements could lead to 
genetic disorders such as hereditary disease, blood disorder, and neurological disorder. In fact, Alu elements are associated 
with approximately 0.1% of human genetic disorders. The first part of this review discusses mechanisms of Alu amplification 
and diversity among different Alu subfamilies. The second part discusses the particular role of Alu elements in generating 
genomic rearrangements as well as human genetic disorders.

Introduction

Transposable elements accounts for ∼45% of the human 
genome. They are divided into DNA transposon and retro-
transposons, according to their amplification mechanisms. 
DNA transposons mobilize through a “cut and paste” me-
chanism while retrotransposons propagate through “copy 
and paste” mechanism. Retrotransposon transcribes its RNA 
intermediate, and the RNA intermediate integrates into a 
new genomic region using a mechanism called target primed 
reverse transcription (TPRT). Endogenous retroviruses, long 
interspersed elements (LINEs), and short interspersed ele-
ments (SINEs) belong to retrotransposon. Alu element, one 
of  the  SINEs,  is  the  most  successful  retrotransposon  in 
primate  genomes.  The  estimated  copy  number  of  the 
elements is 1.1 million and it is currently retrotransposi-

tionally active in the human genome [1]. The full-length Alu 
element is 300 bp long and has a dimeric structure. Both of 
the left and right monomers were derived from 7SL RNA 
gene and thus they share a high level of sequence identity. 
Alu elements have an internal RNA polymerase III promoter 
(A and B boxes) in the 5' region and a poly (A) tail in the 3' 
end. The transcription of Alu element is initiated by internal 
RNA polymerase III promoter and terminated at a nearby 
genomic  location  having  TTTT  terminator  because  the 
element lacks a transcription terminator (Fig. 1). Alu elem-
ents use L1 enzyme machinery for their mobilization. L1 
provides  Alu  elements  with  endonuclease  and  reverse 
transcriptase. L1 endonuclease recognizes consensus oligo-
mer (5'-TTTT/AA-3') and cleaves the genomic region. A-rich 
region of Alu elements binds to the released consensus site 
and  the  elements  are  reverse-transcribed  by  L1  reverse 
transcriptase.  The  second  strand  of  the  Alu  element  is

Fig.  1. Structural schema of Alu elements.  A  full-length Alu  element  is  300  bp  in  length  and  composed  of  left  monomer,  right  monomer,
and poly(A) tail. A and B boxes in the left monomer contain RNA polymerase III promoter binding sites. Alu inserts in the host genome 
using  target  site  duplication  (TSD)  of  flanking  region.

Fig.  2.  Mechanisms  of Alu  amplification.  This  figure  depicts  four  different  mechanisms  for Alu  amplification.  (A)  Master  gene  model  is
a typical mechanism. All members of the same Alu subfamily are derived from one or a few transpositionally active Alu elements. When
the  active Alu  element  mutates  but  remains  the  transposition  activity,  it  will  produce  a  new  Alu  subfamily.  (B)  Intermediate  model  is 
literally  an  intermediate  form  of  master  gene  and  transposon  models.  More  than  a  few  active Alu  elements  exist  in  host  genome  and 
each  of  them  actively  produces  its  progenies.  (C)  Transposon  model  suggests  that  all  Alu  elements  including  mutated  elements  have 
transposition  activities.  (D)  Stealth  driver  model  suggests  that  old Alu  element  which  stayed  transcriptionally  dormant  for  the  extended
period  can  produce  a  new Alu  subfamily  by  retrieving  a  high  transposition  activity.  Green  and  blue  boxes  indicate  active  and  inactive
Alu  elements,  respectively.  X  indicates  a  mutation  and  the  mutated  Alu  elements  represent  different  subfamilies. 

synthesized by host DNA polymerase using the first strand 
of the Alu element as a DNA template. The newly inserted 
Alu element has 7 to 20 bp direct repeats on both sides of the 
element, termed target site duplications (TSDs) [2, 3].

Alu elements are divided into several subfamilies which 
are determined based on diagnostic nucleotides. During the 
past 60 million years of the primate genome evolution, old 
Alu subfamilies became retrotranspositionally dormant while 
new Alu subfamilies emerged and expanded, leading to the 
increased number of different Alu subfamilies. The generally 

accepted  canonical  mechanism  for  Alu  amplification  is 
master gene model [4] but it could not explain the recent 
expansion of AluYb subfamily in the human genome: AluYb 
subfamily was retrotranspositionally dormant for the past 20 
million years but it retrieved the ability to retrotranspose and 
rapidly expanded in the human genome within the past a few 
million years, which led to a new model of Alu amplification, 
stealth model, to explain the aberrant amplification of AluYb 
subfamily [5].

contributing to human genetic diversity [2, 4, 6]. Alu element 
is  able  to  disrupt  gene  function  either  by  inserting  into 
exonic regions or causing alternative splicing of the genes. In 
addition, they could cause genomic deletions through inser-
tion-mediated deletion or recombination-associated deletion. 
The homologous recombination (HR) between Alu elements 
has  associated  with  genomic  duplications,  genomic  con-
version as well as genomic deletions in the human genome. 
The genomic changes could affect gene expression and lead 
to abnormal proteins resulting in genetic diseases [7-11].

Amplification and Diversity of Alu Elements

Alu elements emerged in the primate genome, approxi-
mately 65 million years ago (mya). Since then, they have 
successfully amplified and diversified in primate genomes. 
However, their amplification rate has been fluctuated over 
the time. The majority of Alu elements were inserted in the 
primate  genome  ∼40  mya  and  one  new  Alu  insertion 
occurred in every birth at the time of the most successful 
amplification [1], which is much higher than an averaged 
amplification rate, one insertion every 21 new births during 
the past 60 million years [10, 12]. Alu elements are divided 
into different subfamilies according to key diagnostic nucl-

eotides on them. Therefore, Alu elements sharing the diag-
nostic  nucleotides  are  grouped  into  the  same  subfamily. 
Major Alu lineages are AluJ, AluS, and AluY which are dis-
tinguished from each other, based on 18 diagnostic nucle-
otides on their sequences [6]. Among the three major line-
ages, AluY lineage is the youngest and AluJ lineage is the 
oldest. During the long time, AluJ subfamilies have accu-
mulated more random mutations on them and thus their 
mutation  rates  are  much  higher  than  the  younger  sub-
families [2].

There  are  four  different  models  suggested  for  Alu  ex-
pansion. The first model is master gene model which well 
explains how new Alu subfamily is created. It suggests that 
new  Alu  subfamily  is  generated  by  point  mutation(s)  of 
retrotranspositionally hyperactive Alu element. During the 
primate evolution, the master genes accumulated diagnostic 
nucleotide changes, leading to different subfamilies at diffe-
rent times. Thus, all Alu subfamilies were derived from a 
series of sequential master genes which accumulated diag-
nostic base changes, and all members of an Alu subfamily 
were propagated from a few master genes representing the 
subfamily. Because Alu element contains a high content of 
CpG dinucleotide, point mutation frequently occurs on them. 
In general, the master genes produce a high number of its

of the respective gene. (A) Alu insertion in the exonic region. Exons could be skipped and deleted, called exon skipping. (B) Alu insertion
in the genic region, Alu element is able to provide a polyadenylation signal. Thus, Alu element could induce the premature termination 

of  gene  transcription.  (C–E) Alu  element  is  also  able  to  provide  cryptic  splicing  sites,  leading  to  alternative  gene  transcripts.  Blue  and

red  boxes  indicate  exon  and  Alu  element.  Arrow  shows  promoter  and  the  dash  line  indicates  alternative  splicing  form.

progenies (Fig. 2A) [4, 6]. However, some Alu elements have 
low retrotranspositional activity and their amplification is 
not well explained by the master gene model. Unlike the 
master  gene  model,  transposon  model  suggests  that  all 
elements have a similar capability of generating new copies 
(Fig. 2C). The third model is intermediate model which is 
literally  the  intermediate  of  master  gene  and  transposon 
models. The third model suggests that there are much more 
than  a  few  hyperactive  Alu  elements  (Fig.  2B)  [4,  13]. 
Recently, Han et al. [5] introduced the forth model called 
stealth  model.  It  follows  the  concept  of  the  master  gene 
model but explains aberrant amplification of Alu elements. 
Hyperactive Alu elements get mutated and lose its retro-
transpositional capability relatively quickly by selection. In 
contrast, Alu elements with a low retrotransposition activity 
are able to retain its retrotransposition activity and produce 
the short-lived hyperactive Alu elements over an extended 
period  of  time.  It  was  introduced  to  explain  the  recent 
remarkable expansion of old Alu elements, AluYb lineage, in 
the human genome (Fig. 2D) [5].

Alu Insertion

Alu element is a primate-specific retrotransposon and has 
played  an  important  role  in  primate  genomic  diversity. 
During the past six million years, 5,530 Alu elements newly 
inserted into the human genome [14, 15]. Most of them 
were  propagated  through  classical  insertion,  in  that,  Alu 
elements are inserted into the human genome using TPRT 
mechanism. The hallmark of the classical Alu insertions is 
TSDs flanking both ends of an Alu element. However, Alu 
elements  integrated  through  non-classical  insertions  are 
deficient of TSDs but have instead 1 to 7 bp microhomolo-
gous sequences on their pre-insertion site. When chromo-
somal double strand break (DSB) happens, Alu element is 
able to integrate into the genomic region through the HR 
between the elements and the chromosomal break site [14, 
16]. Through the de novo insertion event, Alu elements have 
modified the human genome in a species-specific manner. In 
addition, they could disrupt genes by inserting into their 
exonic regions (Fig. 3A). Alu elements locating in the intronic 
region  could  also  regulate  gene  function  by  promoting 
alternative splicing of the genes; the elements have multiple 
splice donor/accept sites (Fig. 3D). The alternative splicing 
generates  Alu exonization or/and  intron retention  in res-
pective transcripts, which could disrupt or modify the func-
tion of the genes (Fig. 3C and 3E) [8, 17]. As mentioned 
above, Alu elements have a relatively high point mutation 
rate and can obtain splicing sites by the point mutations after 
the insertion. The Alu elements provide cryptic splicing sites 
and recognize these sites by splicing factors (Fig. 3C and 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

3D). Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) gene encodes mito-
chondrial  enzyme  ornithine  δ-aminotransferase,  which 
converts  ornithine  to  glutamate.  The  deficiency  of  this 
enzyme results in autosomal recessive eye disease. The third 
intron  of  OAT  gene  contains  the  right  monomer  of  Alu 
element  which  is  residues,  279  to  138,  of  antisense  Alu 
element.  The  antisense  Alu  monomer  provides  cryptic 
splicing sites by the point mutation, cytosine to guanine. The 
cryptic splicing site causes an alternative splicing of the gene, 
disrupting the function of OAT gene. Consequently, patients 
suffer  from  gyrate  atrophy  of  the  choroid  and  retina  by 
producing  abnormal  proteins  [18].  Alu  elements  can 
influence  gene  function  through  RNA  editing  which  is  a 
post-transcriptional alteration. Adenosine deamination by 
an enzyme, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) 
results in inosine, which in turn interpreted as guanosine by 
translation or spliceosome machinery. Adenosine to inosine 
(A-to-I) is the most frequent RNA editing in humans. A-to-I 
RNA editing occurs within a long duplex of RNA sequence 
because  ADAR  works  only  on  double  strand  RNA 
structures.  Due  to  the  dimeric  structure,  Alu  element  in 
RNA sequences forms the stem loop structure, leading to 
A-to-I  RNA  editing  [19].  In  addition,  two  Alu  elements 
located in close to each other can make a stem loop structure, 
which result in A-to-I editing and the edited Alu element 
could subsequently bring out novel alternative splicing site 
[19-23]. On the other hand, the intronic Alu elements could 
lead  to  deletion  of  nascent  exons,  which  is  called  exon 
skipping. It therefore disrupts open reading frames of the 
human genes (Fig. 3A). Ganguly et al. [24] have reported 
that intronic insertion of AluYb9 causes exon skipping and 
leads to hemophilia A disease. Hemophilia A is an X-linked 
disorder caused by exon skipping of exon 19 in Factor VIII 
gene. AluYb9 locates in the intron 18 of the gene and causes 
the skipping of the exon19 from the gene transcript.

Alu elements could regulate gene function by providing 
canonical polyadenylation signal, AATAAA (Fig. 3B) [25, 
26]. Alu elements contain three potential polyadenylation 
sites and two of them are active in the human genome. 
One of the previous studies on Alu elements has reported 
that ∼10,000 Alu elements are identified within the 3' untr-
anslated region (UTR) of protein coding human genes. Among 
them, 107 Alu elements retain active polyadenylation site. 
Interestingly,  99%  of polyadenylation-active Alu  elements 
locate in the forward direction although the elements exist in 
the 3' UTR of human genes randomly, regarding the insertion 
direction.  In  addition,  old  Alu  subfamily  has  more  active 
polyadenylation sites than younger subfamilies [27, 28]. An 
example of Alu polyadenylation site affecting gene function 
is calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) which is a member of G 
protein-coupled  receptor.  The  gene  involves  in  regulating

extracellular level of calcium ion. Alu element locates in the 
exon 7 of the gene and pre-terminates transcripts of CaSR by 
providing a stop codon signal. Patients having the missense 
mutations show symptoms of familial hypocalciuric hyper-
calcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism [29-31].

Recombination between Alu Elements

A total of 515 Alu-mediated deletion events have been 
identified  in  the  human  genome.  The  deletion  events 
occurred  either  through  Alu  insertion-mediated  deletions 
(AIMD) or Alu recombination-mediated deletions (ARMD): 
24 AIMDs and 492 ARMDs. AIMDs and ARMDs have deleted 
11,206 and 396,420 base pairs of the human genome, res-
pectively, after the divergence of the human and chimpanzee 
lineages (∼6 mya) [14, 32-34]. Alu element has been fre-
quently involved in the genomic recombination because of 
its  two  characteristics:  a  high  level  of  sequence  identity 
among  them  and  its  abundance  in  the  human  genome. 
Among the 492 ARMD events, 197 ARMD events were occ-
urred  by  the  recombination  between  Alu  elements  be-
longing to different subfamilies. Although AluJ subfamily is 
more abundant than AluY subfamily in the human genome, 
AluY  subfamily  is  more  associated  with  ARMD  events 
because AluY subfamily retains a higher sequence identity 
among its members than AluJ subfamily does. Alu element 
accumulates random mutations over time so that older Alu 
elements have more mutations than younger elements [33].
DNA DSB is one of the most dangerous events of DNA 
damage.  In  the  human  genome,  it  could  be  repaired  by 
retrotransposons using two different mechanisms: nonho-

mologous  end-joining  mediated  deletion (NHEJ)  and  HR 
[34]. NHEJ does not need a homologous template for repair 
of DSBs while HR requires sequence homologies on either 
side of the break for the repair (Fig. 4A). DSB repair by NHEJ 
mechanism  is  initiated  by  an  enzyme  complex  including 
Ku70/80 heterodimer. After the enzyme complex binds to 
either side of DSB, it functions as a docking site for other 
NHEJ  enzymes  such  as  DNA  ligase  [35,  36].  Nonallelic 
homologous recombination (NAHR) is one of HRs. It occurs 
between two DNA sequences which are not alleles but share 
a high sequence similarity from one another. Major NAHR 
hotspots  for  several  human  diseases  locate  at  repeat  ele-
ments including Alu element. During meiosis, Alu elements 
can  misalign  and  the  subsequent  crossover  could  lead  to 
genetic rearrangements of duplication, deletion, and trans-
location [37, 38]. NAHR is proceeded either by interchro-
mosomal recombination, in which occurs between different 
chromosomes or intrachromosomal recombination, in which 
recombination  occurs  via  crossing  over  within  the  same 
chromosome. Interchromosomal recombination results in a 
deletion  or  duplication  depending  the  orientation  of  the 
DNA sequences. Intrachromosomal recombination results 
in a deletion or inversion (Fig. 4B).

Genetic Disorder Caused by Alu Elements

During the past 6 million years, Alu elements have mo-
dified the human genome in a species-specific manner and 
also caused human disease through de novo insertion or the 
recombination  between  them.  Genomic  rearrangements 
induced by Alu insertion account for approximately 0.1% of 

Fig.  4. Mechanisms of Alu recombination-mediated deletions. (A) Nonhomologous end-joining mediated deletion mechanism. After DNA
double  strand  breaks,  non-homologous  templates  are  ligated  by  Alu  element.  (B)  Nonallelic  homologous  recombination  mechanism, 
interchromosomal recombination occurs between two different Alu elements which locate on different chromosomes and mediates genomic
duplication or deletion. Intrachromosomal recombination occurs between two different Alu elements which locate on the same chromosome
and  mediates  genomic  deletion.  Green  and  yellow  boxes  represent  Alu  elements.  The  red  dot  line  indicates  homologous  sequences.

ARMD, Alu recombination-mediated deletions; NAHR, nonallelic homologous recombination; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining mediated 
deletion;  FoSTeS/MMBIR,  fork  stalling  and  template  switching/microhomology-mediated  break-induced  replication.

human  diseases  and  genomic  deletions  by  ARMD  are 
responsible for approximately 0.3% of human genetic dis-
orders [10, 32, 33]. There are many Alu elements which are 
closely related to human diseases (Table 1) [39-53]. Alström 
syndrome is a rare genetic disease which is caused by Alu 
insertion in ALMS1 gene. ALMS1 is composed of 23 exons 
and encodes centrosome and basal body-associated protein 
which plays an important role in microtubule organization, 
especially form and maintain cilia. The protein is associated 
with insulin resistance, hypogonadism, and heart disease. 
Therefore, Alström syndrome has several symptoms such as 
blindness  and  obesity.  Most  mutations  causing  Alström 
syndrome occur in exons 8, 10, and 16 of ALMS1 [54]. The 
mutation  of  ALMS1  caused  by  Alu  element  was  first 
discovered in 2013. AluYa5 element exists in the exon 16 of 
ALMS1, which disrupts open reading frame, leading to fra-
meshift  mutation  [40].  Pulmonary  arterial  hypertension 
(PAH) is also caused by Alu element, which locates in BMPR2 
gene. BMPR2 locates on chromosome 2 and has 13 exons. 
Exons 1–3 encoding an extracellular domain were deleted by 
the recombination between two different AluY elements in 
PAH patients. In another PAH patient, the exon 10 of the 
gene was deleted by AluSx involved-nonhomologous recom-
bination.  The  recombination  took  place  between  the  Alu 
element in the intron 9 and a unique sequence in the intron 
10 of the gene [41]. Fork stalling and template switching/ 
microhomology-mediated break-induced replication model 
(FoSTeS/MMBIR) has been often proposed in cases where 

the complexity of the genomic rearrangement is not able to 
be explained by using classic recombination mechanisms. 
Recently, Alu element was reported to be associated with a 
human genomic deletion responsible for Waardenburg syn-
drome type 4 (WS4). WS4 is a rare neural crest disorder. 
Three Alu elements are involved in the large deletion within 
SOX10  regulatory  sequences  in  patients  with  WS4.  The 
deletion could be explained by a two-step FoSTeS/MMBIR 
mechanism mediated via the 4-bp and 13-bp microhomology 
found at the Alu1/Alu3 and Alu3/Alu2 breakpoints, respec-
tively. The deletion of SOX10 regulatory sequences was also 
identified in patients with Hirschsprung disease and peri-
pheral  demyelinating  neuropathy–central  dysmeylinating 
leukodystrophy [50].

Conclusion

In this review, we discuss the amplification of Alu ele-
ments and its impact on human genomic rearrangements 
and  human  disease.  Four  different  models:  master  gene, 
intermediate,  transposon,  and  stealth  models  have  been 
suggested to explain the Alu amplification during primate 
evolution.  Among  them,  master  gene  model  is  generally 
accepted to explain the diversity of Alu subfamilies. Since the 
divergence of human and chimpanzee, Alu elements have 
caused  various  genetic/genomic  rearrangements  in  the 
human genome through human-specific insertion, deletion, 
and recombination. Alu elements could repair DSBs in the

human genome using microhomology between the element 
and the break point, leading to de novo Alu insertion. In spite 
of the positive effect, Alu element is considered to be one of 
major factors to cause human genomic instability because 
many  Alu  elements  are  associated  with  various  human 
diseases.  The  recombination  between  Alu  elements  has 
deleted  human  genic  regions  and  subsequently  disrupted 
gene function, leading to human diseases. The abundance of 
Alu  elements  in  the  human  genome  and  a  high  level  of 
sequence  identity  among  them  predispose  them  to  be  a 
tremendous  and  unpredictable  factor  to  cause  genomic 
instability and the related human diseases. Characterization 
of Alu amplification in the human genome and elucidating 
the mechanisms which Alu elements could utilize to cause 
human  diseases  may  help  us  understand  Alu-associated 
pathogenesis and predict Alu-associated human diseases.
