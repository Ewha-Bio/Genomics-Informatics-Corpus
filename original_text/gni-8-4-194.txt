Abstract

The  PIK3CA  gene,  oncogenic  gene  located  on  human 
chromosome  3q26.3,  is  an  important  regulator  of  cell 
proliferation,  death,  motility  and  invasion.  To  evaluate  the 
role  of PIK3CA  gene  in  the  risk  of  Korean  lung  cancer, 
genotypes  of  the  PIK3CA  polymorphisms  (rs11709323, 
rs2699895,  rs3729679,  rs17849074  and  rs1356413)  were 
determined  in  423  lung  cancer  patients  and  443  normal 
controls.  Statistical  analyses  revealed  that  the  geno-
types  and  haplotypes  in  the PIK3CA  gene  were  not  sig-
nificantly  associated  with  the  risk  of  lung  cancer  in  the 
Korean  population,  suggesting  that  these PIK3CA  poly-
morphisms  do  not  contribute  to  the  genetic  suscepti-
bility  to  lung  cancer  in  the  Korean  population.

Introduction

Lung  cancer  has  been  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-re-
lated  deaths  in  Korea,  and  its  incidence  continues  to 
rise  (Shin et al.,  2007).  Nevertheless,  prognosis  of  lung 
cancer  remains  largely  poor  despite  innovations  in  diag-
nostic  testing,  surgical  technique,  and  development  of 
new  chemotherapeutic  agents.  Recently  introduced  tar-
geted  agents  show  different  response  according  to  his-
tologic  subtype,  and  the  efficiency  of  treatment  modal-
ities  for  lung  cancer  depends  on  the  time  of  diagnosis 
(Brambilla et al.,  2001).  Therefore,  there  is  a  great  need

for  rapid  and  efficient  early  detection  methods.  There-
fore,  in  order  to  develop  improved  molecular  biomarkers 
for  early  detection  and  prediction  of  response  to  chemo-
therapy,  it  is  important  to  identify  genetic  alterations 
specific  to  each  subtype  of  lung  cancer.  Single  nucleo-
tide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  have  an  excellent  potential 
to  be  used  as  biomarkers  for  diagnosing  genetic  dis-
eases,  including  cancers,  compared  to  other  less  com-
mon  polymorphisms  and  microsatellite  markers. 
    Phosphatidylinositol  3-kinases  (PI3Ks)  are  a  family  of 
lipid  protein  kinases  that  regulate  various  cellular  func-
tions,  including  cell  proliferation,  survival,  motility,  and 
adhesion  (Engelman  et al.,  2006).  The  PIK3CA  gene 
encodes  a  catalytic  subunit  p110α of  class  IA  PI3Ks 
that  is  located  in  the  downstream  signaling  pathway  of 
growth  factor  receptors,  such  as  EGFR  and  HER2  onco-
proteins;  the  pathway  is  negatively  regulated  by  the 
PTEN  tumor  suppressor  protein.  One  of  the  most  im-
portant  downstream  targets  of  the  p110α complex  in 
cancer  is  AKT,  which  up-regulates  cell  survival,  pro-
liferation,  and  growth  signaling  through  phosphorylating 
multiple  substrates,  including  apoptosis-related  proteins 
(BAD  and  FKHR)  and  the  mTOR  complex  components 
(PRAS40  and  mTOR)  (Manning  and  Cantley,  2007). 
    Somatic  mutations  of  the PIK3CA  gene  have  been  re-
ported  in  a  wide  range  of  human  cancers,  being  espe-
cially  frequent  in  breast,  colorectal,  ovary  and  liver  tu-
mors  (Karakas et al.,  2006).  Mutation  of  the PIK3CA  is 
likely  to  function  as  an  oncogene  in  human  cancers 
(Kang et al.,  2005),  however,  the  mutation  rate  shown  in 
lung  cancer  is  relatively  low  (Kawano  et al.,  2006;  Lee 
et al.,  2005;  Samuels  et al.,  2004).  Furthermore,  muta-
tion  and  copy  number  gain  of  the  PIK3CA  gene  have 
been  reported  to  be  associated  with  lung  cancer 
(Massion  et al.,  2002;  Yamamoto  et al.,  2008),  never-
theless,  the  association  between  polymorphism  and  the 
risk  of  lung  cancer  has  not  yet  been  fully  clarified.
    This  study  was  undertaken  to  examine  the  poly-
morphism  of  PIK3CA,  and  its  relation  with  the  risk  of 
lung  cancer  in  Korean  population.  To  our  best  knowl-
edge,  this  is  the  first  report  on  the  polymorphism  of 
PIK3CA  in  lung  cancer  patients  in  Korean  population.

Methods

Study  subjects

Between  August  2001  and  November  2007,  blood  sam-

ples  were  collected  from  866  subjects,  including  423 
lung  cancer  patients  and  443  normal  controls  without 
cancer.  Lung  cancer  patients  were  recruited  from  the 
patient  pool  at  the  Genomic  Research  Center  for  Lung 
and  Breast/Ovarian  Cancer,  and  control  subjects  were 
randomly  selected  from  a  pool  of  healthy  volunteers 
who  had  visited  the  Cardiovascular  Genome  Center  and 
Genomic  Research  Center  for  Allergy  and  Respiratory 
Diseases.  Detailed  information  on  diet,  smoking  status, 
drinking  status,  lifestyle,  and  medical  history  were  col-
lected  by  a  trained  interviewer  using  a  structured 
questionnaire.  Out  of  423  cases,  413  smoking  status, 
335  stage,  and  407  cell  types  were  available  for  charac-
teristic  information,  while  341  smoking  status  out  of  443 
controls  were  available  for  characteristic  information 
(Table  1).  All  study  subjects  provided  written  consents 
and  were  ethnic  Koreans,  and  all  the  participating 
Institutional  Review  Boards  approved  the  study  protocol.

Preparation  of  genomic  DNA  and  genotyping

Genomic  DNA  was  prepared  from  peripheral  blood  sam-
ples  using  a  Puregene  blood  DNA  kit  (Gentra,  Minneap-
olis,  MN,  USA),  according  to  the  manufacture’s  proto-
col.  We  performed  genotyping  for  the  five  polymor-
phisms  (rs11709323,  rs2699895,  rs3729679,  rs17849074 
and  rs1356413).  Genotyping  was  done  by  the  SNP-IT 
assay  using  the  SNPstream  25K  System  (Orchid  Biosci-
ences,  Princeton,  NJ,  USA).  Briefly,  the  genomic  DNA

region  spanning  the  polymorphic  site  was  amplified  pol-
ymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  by  one  phosphothiolated 
primer  and  one  regular  PCR  primer.  The  amplified  PCR 
products  were  then  digested  with  T7  exonuclease.  The 
5'  phosphothiolates  protected  one  strand  of  the  PCR 
product  from  T7  exonuclease  digestion,  resulting  in  the 
generation  of  a  single-stranded  PCR  template.  The  sin-
gle-stranded  PCR  template  was  overlaid  on  a  384-well 
plate  that  contained  a  covalently  attached  SNP-IT  pri-

version  3.2.  The  haplotypes  and  their  frequencies  were 
estimated  by  the  Haploview  program  version  3.2.  Geno-
type-specific  risks  were  estimated  as  odds  ratios  (ORs) 
with  associated  95%  confidence  intervals  by  uncondi-
tional  logistic  regression  (SAS  version  9.1;  SAS  Institute, 
Cary,  NC,  USA)  and  adjusted  for  age,  gender  and  smo-
king  status.

coefficients  (|D’|  and r2)  and  haplotypes  among  the  poly-
morphisms  were  calculated  (Fig.  1).  Haplotype  block  in-
cluded  rs2699895,  rs3729679  and  rs17849074  among 

the  five  polymorphisms. 
    Association  of  lung  cancer  risk  with  PIK3CA  poly-
morphisms  was  then  analyzed  (Table  2),  revealing  no 
association  of  the  five  polymorphisms  with  the  risks  of

lung  cancer.  The  association  of  the  polymorphisms  with 
the  risk  of  lung  cancer  was  further  examined  after  strat-
ifying  the  subjects  according  to  gender  and  smoking 
status.  However,  subsequent  analysis  also  revealed  no 

significant  association.  Furthermore, 
the  haplotypes 
(C-A-T,  A-G-T  and  C-A-C)  of  PIK3CA  polymorphisms 
were  not  associated  with  the  risks  of  lung  cancer  in 
three  alternative  models  (Table  3).

PIK3CA  Polymorphism  and  Lung  Cancer  Risk    199

Discussion

References

Most  human  malignancies  are  caused  by  somatic  varia-
tions  within  the  cancer  genome,  leading  to  activation  of 
oncogenes  or  inactivation  of  tumor  suppressor  genes, 
and  many  of  the  resultant  changes  target  cell  signaling 
pathways  (Vogelstein  and  Kinzler,  2004).  PI3K/AKT  path-
way  is  the  major  pathway  controlling  cell  growth  and  tu-
morigenesis  (Cantley,  2002;  Katso et al.,  2001;  Vivanco 
and  Sawyers,  2002),  and  the  pathway  lies  downstream 
of  receptor  tyrosine  kinase,  including  EGFR.  In  addition 
to PIK3CA,  other  components  of  the  pathway,  including 
the  loss  of  the  inhibitor  PTEN  or  activating  mutation  of 
AKT,  occurs  in  certain  cancers  (Samuels  and  Ericson, 
2006;  Shibata  et al.,  2009). 
    Recently,  a  few  studies  revealed  genetic  variations  of 
PIK3CA  gene  in  colon,  rectal  and  bladder  cancer  risk 
(Chen et al.,  2009;  Slattery et al.,  2010),  however,  there 
has  been  no  study  done  on  the  association  between 
lung  cancer  risk  and  polymorphism  of  PIK3CA  gene  in 
the  Korean  population.  In  this  study,  we  hypothesized 
that  PIK3CA  polymorphisms  are  associated  with  lung 
cancer  risk.  However,  our  finding  indicated  no  associa-
tion  between  PIK3CA  polymorphisms  and  lung  cancer 
risk  in  the  Korean  population. 
    Genetic  variations  often  show  ethnic  variation  (Kim et 
al.,  2006;  Kim et al.,  2008).  In  the  present  study,  the  ob-
served  frequencies  of  the  minor  alleles  of  rs11709323, 
rs2699895,  rs3729679,  rs17849074  and  rs1356413  were 
0.116,  0.186,  0.189,  0.041  and  0.111,  respectively. 
According  to  the  HapMap  database,  the  frequencies  of 
the  minor  alleles  in  Asian  ethnic  groups  (Han  Chinese 
and  Japanese)  were  shown  to  be  0.045,  0.148,  0.193, 
0.045  and  0.039,  respectively,  thus  showing  similar  fre-
quencies  to  the  present  study.
    A  series  of  our  previous  studies  showed  that  poly-
morphisms  of  oncogene,  tumor  suppressor  gene  and  re-
ceptor  tyrosine  kinase  are  related  to  lung  cancer  risk 
(Choi  et al.,  2009;  Jo  et al.,  2008;  Kim  et al.,  2010; 
Sung  et al.,  2008).  On  the  other  hand,  however,  the 
genotypes  of  PIK3CA  gene  polymorphisms,  determined 
in  866  Koreans  in  the  present  study,  revealed  no  sig-
nificant  difference  between  lung  cancer  patients  and 
normal  controls.  This  result  suggests  that PIK3CA  gene 
polymorphisms  are  not  likely  to  play  a  major  role  in  the 
susceptibility  of  Korean  to  lung  cancer.
