HOTAIR is an lncRNA that has been known to have an oncogenic role in different cancers. There is limited knowledge of 
genetic  and  epigenetic  elements  and  their  interactions  for  the  gene  encoding  HOTAIR.  Therefore,  understanding  the 
molecular mechanism and its regulation remains to be challenging. We used different in silico analyses to find genetic and 
epigenetic elements of HOTAIR gene to gain insight into its regulation. We reported different regulatory elements including 
canonical promoters, transcription start sites, CpGIs as well as epigenetic marks that are potentially involved in the regulation 
of HOTAIR gene expression. We identified repeat sequences and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are located within or 
next to the CpGIs of HOTAIR. Our analyses may help to find potential interactions between genetic and epigenetic elements 
of HOTAIR gene in the human tissues and show opportunities and limitations for researches on HOTAIR gene in future 
studies.

Introduction

It has been estimated that about 1.5% of human genomic 
DNA can be annotated as protein coding sequences [1]. So, 
more  than  98%  of  the  human  genome  does  not  encode 
protein [2, 3]. However, a large proportion of the genome 
transcribes  non-coding  RNAs  such  as  miRNAs  and  long 
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [4, 5]. LncRNAs have impor-
tant roles in different cellular and molecular mechanisms 
[6]. These long RNAs regulate the activity and position of 
epigenetic machinery during cell function and segregation 
[7]. In fact, some of the lncRNAs can recruit catalytic activity 
of  chromatin-modifying  proteins  [8].  Dysregulation  of 
lncRNAs  has  been  also  reported  in  cancer  initiation  and 
progression. However, the molecular mechanism and regulation 
of these RNAs have been remained to be unknown [9, 10].
Rinn et al. [11] identified HOTAIR lncRNA with a 2.2 kb 
length. HOTAIR gene is located in a region between HOX11 
and  HOX12  on  chromosome  12q13.3  [12-16].  HOTAIR 
lncRNA  binds  to  both  polycomb  repressive  complex  2 
(PRC2) and lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) complexes, 
through its 5’-3’ domains and directs them to HOXD gene 

cluster  as  well  as  other  genes  in  order  to  increase  gene 
silencing by coupling the histone H3K27 trimethylation and 
H3K4 demethylation [17, 18]. 

HOTAIR  is  an  oncogene  RNA  that  is  known  to  have 
potential  role  in  several  cancers.  Its  overexpression  is 
reported in different solid tumors such as breast, gastric, and 
colorectal tumors [19, 20]. The oncogenic role of HOTAIR is 
reported in different mechanisms such as cell proliferation, 
invasion, aggression, and metastasis of the tumor cells as 
well as inhibition of apoptosis [3, 21-25]. In spite of different 
reports  on  the  potential  oncogenic  role  of  HOTAIR,  the 
molecular regulation of this gene needs to be revealed by 
more studies.

Since  the  genetic  and  epigenetic  complexities  of  the 
HOTAIR locus have not been characterized yet, we aimed to 
provide  an  integration  data  to  highlight  different  com-
positional  features of  HOTAIR gene. The  potential  model 
may help to design future studies to reveal the molecular 
mechanisms of this lncRNA. In this study, we highlighted 
and described a number of features in HOTAIR locus, which 
may be involved in regulation of this gene. The integrated 
report  is  derived  from  the  in  silico  approaches  through 
different databases and software.

Elements  (ENCODE)  project  cited  in  University  of 
California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser. Encode is a 
genome-wide consortium project with the aim of cataloging 
all functional elements in the human genome through related 
experimental conditions. In addition, all of the software was 
run with default parameters and criteria. The description of 
each software and database as well as their criteria of the 
analyses are described in below. 

Methods 

Different  databases  and  bioinformatics  software  were 
used. Then, the data were reanalyzed and integrated in order 
to provide a potential model for describing the genetic and 
epigenetic features of the HOTAIR locus. Table 1 shows list of 
the in silico tools used in this study and the methodology is 
represented  as  a  flowchart  (Fig.  1).  In  our  analyses,  the 
desired  sequence  was  mostly  defined  as  a  sequence  that 
spans from 2 kb upstream of annotated transcription start 
site (TSS) of HOTAIR to the end of the gene. The selection 
was  based  on  the  previous  studies  defining  putative 
promoter regions from −2 kb to +1 kb of the TSS [26]. 
Some  data  were  analyzed  through  Encyclopedia  of  DNA

Results
HOTAIR gene is transcribed into different RNA 
isoforms by alternative compositional features

According to the Ace view database, 11 distinct GT-AG 
introns are identified in the HOTAIR gene. This results in 
seven different transcripts, six of which are created through 
alternative  splicing  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/ 
research/acembly/).  Different  variants  were  found  in 
GENECODE V22 and Ensembl. According to the Refseq, 
there  are  three  transcript  variants  for  this  gene  (NR_ 
047518.1, NR_047517.1 and NR_003716.3) (Fig. 2).

Since it seems that alternative transcripts of HOTAIR are 
due to alternative promoters, TSSs, alternative polyadeny-
lation sites, and alternative splicing, we tried to find different 
promoters,  TSSs,  polyadenylation,  and  splice  sites  in  the 
HOTAIR gene. 

We found alternative promoters and polyadenylation sites 
in  the  HOTAIR  locus  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ieb/ 
research/acembly/).  According  to  the  Ensembl,  there  are 
two active promoters in this gene (Fig. 3). Also, Chromatin 
state  segmentation  using  Hidden  Markov  Model  (HMM) 
[27]  identified  these  two  active  promoters  as  well  as 
enhancers in the HOTAIR gene in some cell lines. The HMM 
is  a  probabilistic  model  representing  probability  distri-
butions  over  sequences  of  observations.  Supplementary 
Table 1 which is based on UCSC hg19, shows the positions 
of the active promoters of HOTAIR locus in Ensemble and 
HMM. 

Promoter  prediction  with  different  tools  recognized 
alternative promoters throughout this gene. Promoter scan 
program was run with the default promoter cutoff score. 
This  program  predicts  promoters  based  on  the  degree  of

homologies with eukaryotic RNA pol II promoter sequences 
(https://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan/) 
[28]. 
Different  TSSs  were  also  found  in  the  HOTAIR  gene  by 
different  programs  and  software 
including  Eponine, 
Switchgear,  and  Promoter  2  [29].  The  Eponine  program 
provides  a  probabilistic  method  for  detecting  TSSs.  The 
Switchgear algorithm uses a scoring metric based largely on 
existing transcript evidence. Promoter2 takes advantage of a 
combination  of  principles  that  are  common  to  neural 
networks  and  genetic  algorithms.  The  positions  of  found 
TSSs compared to other features are shown in the Supp-
lementary Table 1. 

CpG islands were found to be overlapped with 
active promoters and DNase I hypersensitivity sites

According  to  the  UCSC  browser,  bona  fide  CpGIs, 
Weizmann Evolutionary, and CpG ProD program, there were 
different CpG Islands (CGIs) in the HOTAIR gene. These 
CpGIs  are  shown  in  the  Fig.  4.  UCSC  genome  browser 
identifies CGIs of human genome based on the regions of 
DNA with average (G+C) content greater than 50%, length 
greater than 200 bp and a moving average CpG O/E greater 
than 0.6 [30, 31]. “Bona fide” identifies functional CpGIs by 
linking genetic and epigenetic information [32]. Weizmann 
evolutionary (WE) predicts highly conserved CGIs through 
their classification of evolutionary dynamics (http://genome. 
ucsc.edu/) [33]. “CpG ProD” program identifies CpGIs-ov-
erlapping with promoters in the large genomic regions under 
analysis  and  shows  these  CpGIs  with  length  longer  than 
other CpGIs [34]. Then, we tried to find any overlap between 
CpGIs  and  other  regulatory  elements.  Two  TSSs  (CHR-
12-P0397-R1, CHR12-P0397-R2) were found within CpG165 
(annotated in UCSC genome browser) and 1437 (derived

from bona fide CGIs). The CpGIs were mostly overlapped 
with  the  active  promoter  regions  (Fig.  3,  Supplementary 
Table 1). We focused on CpG165 and found some regulatory 
elements which are within or near to this CpG (Table 2).

In  addition,  several  DNase  I  hypersensitivity  hotspots 
were found to be overlapped with CpGIs in some cell lines 
(Supplementary  Table  1).  We  found  the  DNase  I  hyper-
sensitivity peak clusters of HOTAIR gene in 95 cells with 
score  greater  than  0.6  by  using  UCSC  genome  browser. 
DNase I hypersensitivity peak cluster 19 is located within 
CpG1433 and mostly overlaps with CpG18. Also, DNase I 
hypersensitivity peak cluster 41 is located within CpG1437 
and  mostly  overlaps  with  CpG165  and  partially  overlaps 
with CpG2 (WE) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). 

Furthermore,  we  detected  specific  CpG  dinucleotides 
methylation status within or near the predicted CpGIs in 
some cell lines by using ENCODE (Supplementary Table 2). 
This track identifies specific CpG dinucleotides methylation 
status  by  Infinium  human  methylation  450  bead  array

and (4) methylated (score ≥ 600) (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).

CTCF and transcription factor binding sites are 
overlapped with CpGIs and TSSs

GTEx  RNA-seq  strategy  indicates  that  HOTAIR  has 
variable  expression  in  different  tissues  and  its  most 
expression  level  is  in  the  artery-tibial  tissue  (data  not 
shown). We found two putative regions for CTCF binding 
sites  in  the  HOTAIR  locus  by  ENCODE  with  factorbook 
motifs, one of which is located within CpG1437 (bona fide 
CpGIs) and mostly overlaps with CpG165 (Table 2, Fig. 3). 
This track determines regions of transcription factor binding 
sites  taken  from  a  comprehensive  chip-seq  experiments 
identified by ENCODE and factorbook pool (http://genome. 
ucsc.edu/). We predicted sequences of motifs and positions 
of these motifs in the HOTAIR locus by using MEME and 
MAST programs (Supplementary Table 3). MEME program 
searches  the  motifs  from  downloaded  sequences  through 
using complementary strengths of probabilistic and discrete 
models  (http://MEME-Suite.org/)  [35,  36].  The  program 
was run with default parameters and normal mode of motif 
discovery. Mast program searches specific sequences based 
on predicted motifs by MEME program and exactly matches 
these  sequences  with  the  motifs  sequences  (http:// 
MEME-Suite.org/) [37].

We found nine sequences of modules depending on their 

174

www.genominfo.org

transcription factor binding sites in the HOTAIR locus by 
PReMode  program  [38,  39].  We  observed  some  of  these 
elements  overlapped  with  the  predicted  CpGIs  and  TSSs 
(Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). In addition, we determined 
that  some  of  these  modules  have  common  transcription 
factors (data not shown). 

Some polymorphisms such as tandem repeats exist 
within the regulatory elements

Repeat Masker found several repeats sequences overla-
pped with regulatory elements of the HOTAIR locus such as 
CpGIs (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1) and motifs (Supple-
mentary Table 3). Repeat master investigates query sequences 
and generates a detailed annotation of available repeats in 
these  sequences  and  shows  dispersed  repeats  and  low 
complexity DNA sequences (http://genome.ucsc.edu/). In 
addition,  tandem  repeat  finder,  which  analyzes  simple 
tandem  repeats,  predicted  one  simple  tandem  repeat 
(GAGGGAGGGAGCGAGA) within this gene (Supplementary 
Table  1)  (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)  [40].  In  addition,  we 
found  some  simple  nucleotide  polymorphisms  within  re-
gulatory sequences of HOTAIR gene (Supplementary Table 4). 

Discussion 

Studies  have  shown  that  aberrant  epigenetic  modifi-
cations  including  aberrant  DNA  methylation  and  histone 
modification are significantly involved in the dysregulation 
of genes with their potential roles in cancers [41]. However, 
identification of the exact elements of HOTAIR as well as 
their interaction has not been discovered yet. This study was 
aimed to find and highlight different regulatory elements by 
data integration. We identified putative regulatory elements 
that contribute to the regulation of HOTAIR expression by in 
silico analyses. Identification of these elements suggests new 
understanding  of  HOTAIR  expression  and  might  help  to 
design future studies on this lncRNA which has oncogenic 
role in different cancers [42-45]. 

First, we tried to show different isoforms of HOTAIR RNA 
transcribed through alternative mechanisms. Since a recent 
study suggested the important role of HOTAIR domains in its 
function [46], we propose studying the molecular roles of 
different RNA isoforms in future researches. Then, in order 
to  find  alternative  and  potential  features  involved  in 
generation of RNA isoforms, we checked the putative TSSs, 
promoters,  and  polyadenylation  sites.  We  found  different 
features,  which  are  potentially  involved  in  alternative 
transcription of HOTAIR gene. 

Considering  the  potential  involvement  of  methylation 
beyond  CGI-promoters  in  human  cancer,  we  focused  on 
potential  CGIs  of  HOTAIR.  According  to  the  fact  that 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

function  of  DNA  methylation  seems  to  be  varied  with 
context, we tried to find any relation between the CGIs and 
other  compositional  features  such  as  TSSs,  promoters, 
enhancers, DNase I hypersensitivity sites, and CTCF binding 
sites. Alterations in DNA methylation are known to coo-
perate with genetic elements and to be involved in human 
carcinogenesis. The results showed different CpGIs in the 
HOTAIR  locus  and  determined  their  epigenetic  status 
through  integration  analysis.  The  methylation  status  of 
these CGIs needs to be revealed in future researches. The 
methylation  analysis  will  be  so  important  because  we 
currently  know  that  most  CGIs  located  in  TSSs  are  not 
methylated.  However,  CGI  methylation  of  the  TSS  is 
associated  with  long-term  silencing.  In  addition,  CGIs  in 
gene bodies are sometimes methylated in a tissue-specific 
manner  [47].  It  has  been  reported  that  methylation  of  a 
CTCF-binding  site  may  block  the  binding  of  CTCF. 
Altogether, different CpGIs overlapped with genetic elements 
seem to have important roles in controlling HOTAIR.

Some repeat sequences and single nucleotide polymor-
phisms exist within or next to the predicted CpGIs. We think 
that  repeat  number  variations  may  effect  on  methylation 
status  of  regulatory  regions  of  HOTAIR  gene.  Different 
studies reported some associations between polymorphisms 
of HOTAIR and cancers risks. The examples are the asso-
ciation  between  rs920778  [48],  rs4759314  [49],  and 
rs12826786 [25] and gastric cancer, rs7958904 and colore-
ctal cancer [50], rs920788 and breast cancer [51], rs4759314 
and rs7958904 in epithelial ovarian cancer [52]. We found 
that some SNPs are located within regulatory regions and so 
may effect on the gene expression. Also, since the repeat 
sequences of HOTAIR gene might contribute to the methy-
lation  status  of  regulatory  regions,  we  highlighted  the 
overlaps between these sequences and the predicted CpGIs.
Due to the overlap with active promoter, strong enhancer, 
CTCF binding site, DNase I hypersensitive sites, SNPs, and 
repeat  sequences,  CpG165  seems  to  be  more  important 
compared to other CpGIs for generation of the long RNA 
isoform. However, according to the Fig. 3, considering the 
overlap with other structural features, other CpGIs within 
the  gene  structure  also  seems  to  be  involved  in  gene 
regulation. This integration model should be checked and 
validated in future experimental works. 

Altogether, it seems that alternative transcripts of HOTAIR 
originate from interactions between genetic and epigenetic 
elements. Our data provide strong evidence based on the 
databases  and  in  silico  prediction  that  specific  sequence 
motifs  may  potentially  be  involved  in  DNA  methylation 
states of various set of CGIs in different tissues including 
normal  and  tumors.  Our  study  suggests  that  the  combi-
natorial  binding  of  specific  transcription  factors  plays  a
