In silico Identification of SFRP1 as a Hypermethylated 

Gene in Colorectal Cancers

Aberrant  DNA  methylation,  as  an  epigenetic  marker  of  cancer,  influences  tumor  development  and  progression.  We 
downloaded publicly available DNA methylation and gene expression datasets of matched cancer and normal pairs from the 
Cancer Genome Atlas Data Portal and performed a systematic computational analysis. This study has three aims to screen 
genes that show hypermethylation and downregulated patterns in colorectal cancers, to identify differentially methylated 
regions in one of these genes, SFRP1, and to test whether the SFRP genes affect survival or not. Our results show that 31 
hypermethylated genes had a negative correlation with gene expression. Among them, SFRP1 had a differentially methylated 
pattern at each methylation site. We also show that SFRP1 may be a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer survival.

Introduction

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, 
launched  in  2003  by  the  US  National  Human  Genome 
Research Institute (NHGRI), has accelerated the study of 
various  aspects  of  epigenetics  [1],  among  which  DNA 
methylation has been one of the most actively studied areas 
[2]. DNA methylation refers to the chemical conversion of a 
cytosine nucleotide in DNA to 5-methylcytosine by DNA 
methyltransferase. This phenomenon usually takes place at 
the genomic region where a cytosine is immediately followed 
by a guanine and where the dinucleotide is enriched more 
than expected from the G ＋ C content of the genome. Such 
CpG  islands  (CGIs)  are  typically  found  in  the  promoter 
region of a gene, regulating its expression [3].

Tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), including DNA repair 
genes that repair DNA mismatch during DNA replication, 
maintain  the  normal  activities  of  cells,  preventing  cancer 
development.  On  the  other  hand,  their  hypermethylation 
may repress their expression, influencing the development 
and growth of cancer cells. Moreover, TSG expression may 
cause gene silencing through the hypermethylation of CGIs, 
and such a paradigm opens up a new avenue of cancer diagnosis 

and treatment based on DNA methylation profiles [4].

In  cancer  cells,  genes  that  play  important  roles  in  cell 
growth and differentiation, such as TSG, DNA repair genes, 
and  apoptosis-related  genes,  show  downregulation  in 
expression  due  to  hypermethylation  in  their  promoter 
regions. For example, the expression of p16, a well-known 
TSG,  is  downregulated  due  to  its  promoter  hypermethy-
lation  [5],  and  DNA  repair  genes,  such  as  BRCA1  and 
hMLH1,  are  also  hypermethylated,  repressing  their  gene 
expression [6].

It appears that hypermethylation profiles in CGIs may be 
useful targets for cancer treatment. Some DNA methylation 
inhibitors have been used as anticancer agents, paving a new 
avenue for the development of anticancer therapeutics [7]. 
Gene expression profiles have been used in cancer diagnosis 
and prognosis, but mRNA levels usually fluctuate temporally 
or are greatly influenced by environmental cues, resulting in 
unstable  diagnostic  sensitivity.  On  the  other  hand,  DNA 
hypermethylation can show high specificity and sensitivity in 
cancer diagnosis [8]. Furthermore, its molecular diagnosis is 
gaining  more  and  more  acceptance  due  to  its  availability 
through real-time and quantitative blood testing [9]. In this 
study, we surveyed colon cancer data to look for genes that 
show  hypermethylation,  and  investigated  their  effects  on

Methods
Data

The  Cancer  Genome  Atlas  (TCGA),  launched  in  2009, 
aimed to analyze the genomic features through sequencing 
of about 30 different types of cancers. We downloaded the 
microarray datasets on gene expression and DNA methyla-
tion  of  colorectal  cancer  and  normal  samples  from  the 
following URL: https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/dataAccess 
Matrix.htm (the “Data Type” field was selected as “Clinical,” 
“DNA Methylation,” and “Expression-Genes”). There were 
12 matched cancer/normal pairs of both data types, and these 
were defined as the discovery set. The microarray platforms 
were  UNC__AgilentG4502A_07_3  and  Illumina  Infinium 
Human  DNA  Methylation  27  (Illumina,  San  Diego,  CA, 

Table  1.  Differentially  hypermethylated  and  downregulated  genes

USA) 
for  gene  expression  and  DNA  methylation, 
respectively. For the methylation data, the so-called M-value 
was  calculated  as  the  log2  ratio  of  the  intensities  of  the 
methylated  probe  versus  unmethylated  one,  and  the 
beta-value was the ratio of the methylated probe intensity 
and the overall intensity, either methylated or unmethylated 
[9].

For  the  clinical  outcome  analysis,  we  downloaded  an 
expanded dataset from the URL, totaling 524 samples (202 
samples on the Illumina Infinium Human DNA Methyla-
tion27 platform and 322 samples on the Illumina Infinium 
Human DNA Methylation450 platform), and 419 samples 
with clinical information were used in the survival analysis. 
For these samples, we downloaded a text file on tumor stage, 
last contact days, and vital status.

Identification of hypermethylated and 
downregulated genes

The  discovery  dataset  was  used  for  gene  selection. 
Illumina Infinium Human DNA Methylation27 level 2 data 
were screened for differentially methylated regions (DMRs), 
where the median M of the tumor samples was greater than 
＋1 and that of the matched normal samples was less than 
−1 [9]. For each gene, the mean mRNA expression level in 
tumor samples was compared to that in normal samples. 
Genes  showing  at  least  4-fold  down-regulation  were 
selected. DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) was used 
for the functional annotation of the gene list.

Survival analysis

Survival  analysis  was  undertaken  with  the  survival 
package in R (version 2.13.0). Survival time was represented 
by the days since cancer diagnosis in the hospital until the 
last contact date. The survival time of the patients who were 
still alive at the last contact date were treated as censored. 
Kaplan-Meier survival plot and Cox regression analysis were 
also performed with the survival package. In order to parti-
tion patients into two groups according to methylation level, 
the cutoff point was determined by the maximally selected 
rank statistics method, available in the R maxstat package.

TCGA  sample  codes  represent  sample  types:  “01”  for  tumor  sample  and  “11”  for  matched  normal.

Gene ontology and pathway analysis

Gene ontology analysis using DAVID revealed that the 31 
genes were enriched in the Wnt receptor signaling pathway 
(Fisher exact = 9.6E-5); 4 genes—RSPO2, RSPO3, SFRP1, 
and  SFRP2—belonged  to  this  pathway  (Table  2).  Site  of 
Frizzled proteins (SFRP) genes interact directly with Wnt, 
the  ligand  of  the  Wnt  signaling  pathway  Frizzled  (Fz) 
receptor, inhibiting the binding of Wnt to Fz receptor [10]. 
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
pathway  diagram  (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)  also 
confirmed that Wnt and SFRP regulate the Wnt signaling 
pathway at the upstream level (Fig. 3).

Wnt signaling pathway-related genes in colorectal 
cancer

Both the SFRP1 and SFRP2 genes are known to show DNA 
hypermethylation in colorectal cancers; their relatively low 
expression causes upregulation of Wnt signaling and thus 

tumor cell proliferation [11]. Wnt2, a member of the Wnt 
gene family, and  SFRP1  showed drastically opposite gene 
expression patterns in the discovery dataset (Fig. 4). Given 
the premise that downregulation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 due to 
DNA  hypermethylation  deteriorates  the  inhibition  of  the 
Wnt  ligand  signaling  pathway,  we  surveyed  the  gene 
expression profile of the pathway genes, including SFRP. The 
significance of the differential expression of each gene was 
measured by t test using the discovery dataset. The p-value 
distributions were compared between the genes involved in 
Wnt signaling (n = 151) and those that were not involved in 
Wnt signaling (n = 17,658) using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. 
The genes involved in Wnt signaling showed more signifi-
cant differential expression than the others (p = 0.01658). 
SFRP1 and WNT2 were among the top ranked genes of the 
pathway (Fig. 5).

shared between the two platforms, one of them (cg06166767, 
chr8:41287005) did not show hypermethylation, while the 
other three showed similar hypermethylation (Fig. 6). Table 
3  shows  the  correlation  between  differential  methylation 
and differential expression, which was measured using linear

methy  Analysis  was  used  to  depict  the  chromosomal 
location  in  relation  to  CGI,  along  with  the  methylation

among probes. Aberrant methylation patterns of SFRP have 
been  reported  not  only  in  colorectal  cancers  but  also  in 
gastric  cancers  [12],  breast  cancers  [10],  and  pancreatic 
cancers [13]. From TCGA, we downloaded 12 matched pairs 
for  each  cancer  of  the  following  organs:  bladder,  breast, 

esophageal, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, 
and  uterine  corpus  endometrium.  Except  for  liver  and 
endometrial cancers, the DNA methylation levels of both 
SFRP1 and SFRP2 were consistently higher in cancers than in 
the normal counterparts (Fig. 8). It should be noted that in 
colorectal  cancers,  the  mean  methylation  M-value  of  the 
tumor samples was greater than 0. While stomach cancers 
(STAD)  also  showed  a  mean  M  of  greater  than  0,  the 
difference between the tumor and normal sample was not as 
large as in colorectal cancers. In all other cancers, the mean M 
was below 0, implying marginal hypermethylation at most.

Survival analysis: SFRP methylation in association 
with clinical factors

It is well known that the survival rate of colorectal cancer

is negatively correlated with the tumor stage: the higher the 
stage, the poorer the survival. We confirmed this trend in the 
expanded dataset (n = 419). Stages IIA and IIB were merged 
into stage II, and similarly, stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC were 
merged  into  stage  III.  The  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curves 
showed, as expected, lower survival for higher stages (Fig. 
9). The Cox regression analyses also indicated a significant 
association of stage IV with survival rate (mean hazard ratio 
6.083) (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.778 to 20.812; p = 
0.004) (Table 4).

Upon confirming the anticipated survival trends by stage 
in the expanded dataset, we tested whether the methylation 
level of SFRP1 correlated with the survival rate. Among the 
four  methylation  probes,  cg15839448  was  chosen,  as  its 
methylation level showed the most consistent correlation 
with the expression level of SFRP1. In order to separate the 
samples into two groups that showed a survival difference 
according to SFRP1 methylation beta-values, we used maxi-
mally selected rank statistics, implemented in R (the maxstat 
package),  yielding  the  cutoff  point  (beta-value  =  0.598) 
(Fig. 10A). Similarly,  cg23207990 was  chosen  for  SFRP2, 
yielding the cutoff point (beta-value = 0.713) (Fig. 10B).

The group with highly methylated SFRP1 showed poorer 
survival than the other group (p = 0.0181) (Fig. 11A). On 
the other hand, SFRP2 methylation did not exhibit a signifi-
cant relationship (p = 0.107) (Fig. 11B). The corresponding 

hazard ratios from the Cox regression analysis were 1.93 
(95% CI, 1.119 to 3.329) and 1.703 (95% CI, 0.892 to 3.25) 
for  SFRP1  and  SFRP2,  respectively  (Table  4).  As  higher 
tumor  stage  shows  a  higher  risk  rate  in  the  cumulative 
hazard  curve  (Fig.  12A),  higher  SFRP1  methylation  also 
increases the risk rate (Fig. 12B).

In conclusion, hypermethylation of SFRP genes has been 
linked to the downregulation of their expression in colorectal 
cancers [11]. Here, we confirm it using independent TCGA 
datasets.  The  evidence  was  stronger  for  SFRP1  but  only 
marginal  for  SFRP2.  We  also  demonstrate  that  promoter 
hypermethylation  of  SFRP1  is  linked  to  poor  survival  of 
colorectal cancer patients.
