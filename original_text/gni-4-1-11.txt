Abstract 
The aim of this study is to identify hRad21-binding sites 
in  human chromosome, the core component of cohesin 
complex  that  held  sister  chromatids  together.  After 
chromatin immunoprecipitation with an hRad21  antibody, 
it  was  cloned  the  recovered  DNA  and  sequenced  30 
independent  clones.  Among  them,  20  clones  (67%) 
contained repetitive elements including short interspersed 
transposable  elements  (SINE  or  Alu  elements),  long 
terminal repeat (LTR} and long interspersed transposable 
elements (LINE), fourteen of these twenty (70%) repeats 
clones had Alu elements, which could be categorized as 
the  old  and  the  young  Alu  Subfamily,  eleven  of  the 
fourteen  (73%}  Alu  elements  belonged  to  the  old  Alu 
Subfamily, and only three Alu elements were categorized 
as  young  Alu  subfamily.  There  is  no CpG  island within 
these selected  clones.  Association  of  hRad21  with  Alu 
was confirmed  by chromatin  immunoprecipitation-PCR 
using  conserved  Alu  primers.  The  primers  were 
designed  in  the flanking  region  of Alu,  and  the spe!Cific 
Alu  element  was  shown  in  the  selected  clone.  From 
these  experiments,  it  was  demonstrated  that  hRad21 
could bind to SINE,  L TRs, and LINE as well as Alu.

Introduction 
The linkage of sister chromatids, which is provided by a 
multi-subunit  complex  called  cohesion  (Riedel  et  a/., 
2004} remains until every chromosome achieves amphitetic 
attachment, At the onset of anaphase, sister cohesion is 
eliminated by separase, a protease that cleaves the Scc1 
subunit of the cohesion ring (Cairns, 2003)  During DNA

replication, cohesion molecules are laid down along the 
chromosome  and 
to  hold  sister 
chromatids  together  until  anaphase.  It  is  thought  that 
cohesin forms  a ring  around the two sister chromatids, 
with Scc1  and Scc3 bridging the globular heads of SMC1 
and  SMC3.  In  human  cells,  a  remodeling  complex 
containing the ATPase SNF2h was found to co-purify with 
the Scc1  and SMC subunits, presumably due to a direct 
interaction  between  cohesin  and  this  SNF2h  complex. 
These results suggest that the remodeling complex might 
be required to recruit cohesion (Riedel eta/., 2004). 

In  addition,  cohesin,  which  holds  Sister chromatids 
together  after  DNA  replication,  has  been  known  to  be 
involved  in  both  the  repair  of  double  strand  breaks  by 
homologous  recombination  and  the  intra  S  phase 
checkpoint.  Phosphorylation  of  SMC1  is  an  important 
downstream  signal  required  for  mediating  the  intra  S 
phase checkpoint and ether responses to DNA damage. 
Recently,  it  is  known  that  Rad21  is  one  of  the  major 
cohesin  subunits  that  holds  sister  chromatids  together 
until anaphase when proteolytic cleavage by separase, a 
caspase  like  enzyme,  allows  chromosomal  separation 
(Lehmann,  2005}.  In  addition,  Rad21  appears  during 
apoptosis induced by diverse stimuli  (Pati  eta/., 2002). 
And  nuclear  phosphoprotein  Rad21 
is  required  for 
appropriate  chromosomal  cohesion  during  the  mitotic 
cell  cycle  and  double  strand  breaks  repair  after  DNA 
damage (Strom eta/., 2005}. 

In  this  study,  cloning  and  sequencing  the  ChiP 
products  have  been  done  to  manifest  the  cohesin 
binding sites (Hakimi  eta/., 2002). 

Materials and Methods 
Cell lines and cultural conditions 
Human chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells were grown 
in RPMI medium (Gibco, Ufe Technologies, Inc.) containing 
10% fetal  bovine  serum  (Gibco),  streptomycin  (100  /.lg 
/ml},  and  penicillin  (100 units)  in 4 plastic tissue culture 
plates  in  a  humidified  condition  containing  5% C02 at 
3JCC.  The cells were  grown to a density of  1 x1 07  cells 
per dish  before  being  harvested  for  37% formaldehyde 
cross-linking  experiments.  The  cell  line  was  obtained 
from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL 243 ™).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation 
K562  cells  were  treated  with  37%  formaldehyde  for 
1 Ominutes  incubation  at  3rC to  cross-link  hi stones  to 
DNA. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline 
containing  1 Jtg/ml  pepstatin A and  1 mM  phenylmethyl 
sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), the cell pellets were resuspended 
in 300 pJ,  of lysis buffer [150 mM NaCI, 25 mM Tris HCI 
(PH 7.5), 5 mM EDT A,  1% Triton X-100, 0,1%SDS, 0,5% 
sodium deoxycholate] and sonicated for 2x7 seconds in 
ice  cold  environment.  The  lysate  (400  /d)  was  then 
divided into the fraction: One fraction (200 /d) was diluted 
with  18 ml  ChiP dilution buffer [0.01% SDS,  1% Triton 
X-1 00, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCI, (PH 8.1 ),  150 mM 
NaCI], and other fraction (200 /df} was used for nonspecific 
background. The lysate was incubated with 2 p,R,  of anti 
hRad21  antibody (Bethyl} at 4°C overnight or incubated 
with mouse lgG antibody (Abeam) at 4°C as a negative 
control.  To  collect  the  immunoprecipitated  complexes, 
herring testis  DNA/Protein A Agarose-50% surry beads 
were  added  and  incubated  for  1  hour  at  4°C.  After 
washing,  the  beads were  eluted  to  500  pJ,  with  elution 
buffer (1% SDS, 0.1  MNaHC03}. The DNAs cross-linked 
With histone were then reversed by heating the sample at 
65°C for 4 h. The de-crosslinked DNAs were extracted by 
the  phenol/chlorform  method,  ethanol-precipitated,  and 
resuspended in 16 pJ, of distilled water. There was a total 
of four individual chromatin immunoprecipitations in the 
K562 cell line to obtain DNA enriched with anti-chyphone 
hRad21  antibody for cloning purposes (Yutaka et at., 2003). 

aoning of hRad21-enriched DNA fragments 
The  ChiP  products  from  K562  cells  were  treated  with 
Klenow polymerase to fill the gaps into the making blunt 
ends and were ethanol-precipitated, then cloned into the 
zero blunt vector (Invitrogen). To optimize cloning efficiency, 
molar ratio of insert: vector has been keeping as 10:1. This 
ligation solution was stayed at room temperature overnight 
and  could  be  gotten  30  colonies  by  transforming  the 
ligation  reaction  into Top10 One shot competent  E coli 
cells and cultured in S.O.C growth medium overnight.

ChiP Products from K562 Cell were used to confirm the 
correct insertion of the DNA into the vector using the M13 
primers as  follows.

ChiP  products  from  K562  were  used  for  confirmation 
PCR using the oligonucleotide Primers as follows.

The  PCR  products  were  visualized  by  agarose  gel

To identify genes bind to hRad21, ChiP using an anti 
hRad21  antibody is performed and cloned the immunop 
recipitated  DNA.  To  confirm  the  binding  sites,  PCR 
confirmation  of  ChiP  using  anti  hRad21  antibody  was 
done. 

Result 

To identify genes linked to hRad21,  ChiP using an  anti 
hRad21  antibody was performed and cloned the immuno 
precipitated DNA. 

Cell  pellets were  sonicated  several  times  in  various 
inputs and amplitudes. As optimal condition, the showed 
homogenous, about 500 bp sizeed nucleosomal particles 
were  gained.  As  a  first  step  toward  reconstitution  of 
cohesin  activity  in  vitro,  the  minimal  size  of  chromatin 
fragments that would be bound to cohesin in  living cells 
was estimated. Same parameter has not been determined, 
as relevant ChiP data on cohesin-binding sites available 
have  a  resolution  of  no  finer  than  1  kb  (Glynn  et at., 
2004}. 

In  addition,  these fragments were  inserted into zero 
blunt vector using Zero Blunt PCR Cloning Kit which was 
transformed to One Shot Top 10 chemically competent 
E-coli competent cells and cultured. After that 30 clones 
were  randomly  selected  (Table  1),  sequenced  and 
characterized  using  REPBASE  (girinst.orgl)  and  BLAT 
(genome.ucsc.edul)  searches.  It  was  revealed  that  the 
primer sets which  had  been  derived  from  the  selected 
clone  (clone 1 8) was originated from that selected clone 
using PCR technique (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).  Twenty of thirty 
clones (67%) contained repeated elements of the human 
genome.  Among them,  fourteen  of the twenty repeated 
clones (70%) had Alu elements that were categorized as 
the old and the young Alu subfamily.  Eleven of fourteen 
(78%} AIU  elements belonged to the old Alu Subfamily, 
and only three Alu elements were categorized as young 
Alu subfamily. All Alu elements were in or under 200 bp. 

Identification of hRad21-Binding Sites in Human Chromosome  13 

However, some of sequences could begin or end  in the 
middle  of the  elements,  and  the  range  of  Alu  element 
length was  100-150 bp.  Considering that AIU  elements 
from  about  10%  of  the  human  genome,  these  results 
Indicate significant enrichment of Alu elements, suggesting 
high density of chromatin remodeling complexes in these 
retroelements. 

One  clone  (MIR)  related  to  a  short  interspersed 
transposable element (SINE) other than Alu was obtained. 
Another  clone  (LIMEC)  could  be  classified  as  a  Long 
Interspersed  Transposable  Element  (LINE)  which  is 
belonged  to  subclass2  retroelement.  Four  additional 
clones were belonged to subclass3 retroelement named 
as Long Terminal  Repeats (LTR). 

There  was  no  CpG  island  within  these  selected 
clones (data not shown). (www.med.ualberta.ca/tutorials/

been  repeated  in each 30 selected colonies.  After that, 
the  products  were  sequenced  at  the  were  sequenced 
facility. 

To test  this  hypothesis,  one  Alu  clone  of  30  clones 
was selected and prepare primer sets encompassing the 
Alu  elements.  The  primer  was  located  in  the  flanking 
region of the specific Alu element in the selected clone. 
ChiP-PCR by these primers are shown in Fig.  1. DNA of 
clone  18  combined  with  hRad21  antibody  was  found, 
suggesting  that  clone  18  might  be  the  binding  site  of

Discussion 
It  is  important  to  identify  the  coheSin  binding  sites  in 
human genome to explore what is happening when DNA 
damage is  occured  nearby  (Strem  eta/.,  2005).  In  this 
study,  Alu  elements were  identified  as  major seats for 
cohesin  using  chromatin  immunoprecipitation.  It  was

found a correlation between modification of histone tails 
and association of the cohesin complex with chromatin. In 
this study, parts of human genome binding to hRad21  of 
cohesin compiex are identified (Fig.  3). 

The  SNF2h-NuRD-cohesin  complex,  which 

is  a 
chromatin remodeling complex, was recently reported to 
specifically associate with some Alu elements, accompanied 
by histone  H3-Lys 4  methylation.  In  those  studies,  the 
binding of the cohesin complex to chromatin around Alu 
elements  could  be  increased  by  inhibition  of  DNA 
methylation. 

Among 14 Alu clones recovered here, the frequency 
of  old  Alu  elements  (11clones,  78%)  and  young  Alu 
elements  (3  clones,  12%)  and  is  consistent  with  the 
prevalence of old and young Alu elements in the human 
genome. This study shows that hRad21  is characteristic 
of  both  old  and  young  Alu  subfamilies.  Alu  repeats 
represent  the  most  frequent  repetitive  element  in  the 
human genome. 

It was found another repetitive elements, LINE, in one 
clone (5%). LINE elements comprise about 5% of human 
genome and are concentrated in A-T rich regions. In this 
study LINE elements were less specifically targeted than 
Alu elements,  although the  number of clones overall  in 
this  study  was  small.  In  addition,  1  SINE  (5%)  and  4

The  chromatin  remodeling  complex,  SNF2h-NuRD 
was  recently  reported  to  specifically  associated  with 
some  Alu  elements,  accompanied  by  Histone  Lysine 
methylation (Campbell eta/.,  2002). 

In this study it is revealed cohesin itself is bound to Alu 
elements  and  contribute  to  genomic  stability  with 
H3-Lysine  methylation  (Nasmyth  and  Haering.,  2005). 
An obvious functional significance of these findings is to 
provide a molecular mechanism for the known silencing 
of Alu  elements  (Hogue  eta/.,  2002).  This  silencing  is 
thought to be essential  in  reducing the mutational  load 
associated  with  active  Alu  elements  in  dividing  cells 
(Jessberger,  2002).  During  DNA replication,  hRad21  is 
binding  to  the  SMC  heads,  consisting  of  cohesin 
complex and recruits Scc3 to strengthen the structure at 
the Alu sequences of the two sister chromatids (Volkov, 
2005)
