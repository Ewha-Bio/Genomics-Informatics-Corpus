Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible  factor  1α (HIF1α)  is  a  transcription 
factor  that  plays  a  key  role  in  the  adaptation  of  cells  to 
low  oxygen  stress  and  oxygen  homeostasis.  The  oxy-
gen-dependent  degradation  (ODD)  domain  of  HIF1α is 
responsible  for  the  negative  regulation  of  HIF1α  in 
normoxia.  The  interactions  of  the  HIF1α ODD  domain 
with  partner  proteins  such  as  von  Hippel-Lindau  tumor 
suppressor  (pVHL)  and  p53  are  mediated  by  two  se-
quence  motifs,  the  N-  and  C-terminal  ODD  (NODD  and 
CODD).  Multiple  sequence  alignment  with  HIF1α homo-
logs  from  human,  monkey,  pig,  rat,  mouse,  chicken, 
frog,  and  zebrafish  has  demonstrated  that  the  NODD 
and  CODD  motifs  have  noticeably  high  conservation  of 
the  primary  sequence  across  different  species  and 
isoforms.  In  this  study,  we  carried  out  molecular  dynam-
ics  simulation  of  the  structure  of  the  HIF1α CODD  mo-
tif  in  complex  with  the  p53  DNA-binding  domain  (DBD). 
The  structure  reveals  specific  functional  roles  of  highly 
conserved  residues  in  the  CODD  sequence  motif  of 
HIF1α for  the  recognition  of  p53.

Introduction
Hypoxia-inducible  factor  1α (HIF1α)  is  a  master  regu-
lator  in  oxygen  homeostasis  and  in  the  adaptation  of 
cells  to  low  oxygen  stress  (Bruick  and  McKnight,  2002; 
Lee  et al.,  2004;  Semenza,  2001).  HIF1α is  a  ubiq-
uitous,  basic  helix-loop-helix/PAS  (Per,  Arnt,  and  Sim 
protein)  transcription  factor  that  activates  the  expression 
of  genes  that  are  involved  in  angiogenesis,  erythropoi-
esis,  energy  metabolism,  apoptosis,  and  proliferation  in

response  to  hypoxia  (Semenza,  1999;  Semenza,  2003). 
While  it  is  stable  in  hypoxia,  HIF1α,  in  normoxia,  un-
dergoes  ubiquitination  by  von  Hippel-Lindau  tumor  sup-
pressor  (pVHL)  and  subsequent  proteasomal  degra-
dation.  This  sensing  of  change  in  oxygen  levels  is  medi-
ated  by  the  oxygen-dependent  degradation  (ODD)  do-
main  of  HIF1α (Fig.  1).  Binding  of  pVHL  to  the  HIF1α 
ODD  domain  is  dependent  on  the  hydroxylation  of  two 
prolyl  residues,  Pro402  and  Pro564,  in  the  ODD  domain 
(Ivan  et al.,  2001;  Jaakkola  et al.,  2001).  On  the  other 
hand,  the  HIF1α ODD  domain  exerts  its  transcriptional 
activation  function  through  the  interaction  of  its  C-termi-
nal  part  (residues  531∼575,  N-TAD)  with  basal  tran-
scription  machinery  (Jiang et al.,  1996).  Recently,  the  in-
teractions  of  the  HIF1α ODD  domain  with  multiple  part-
ner  proteins,  such  as  ARD1  (Jeong  et al.,  2002),  prolyl 
hydroxylase  (PHD)  (Schofield  and  Ratcliffe,  2004),  and 
p53  (Fels  and  Koumenis,  2005;  Sanchez-Puig  et al., 
2005),  also  have  been  reported. 
    However,  the  molecular  basis  for  the  multiple  binding 
specificity  of  the  HIF1α ODD  domain  has  not  been  un-
derstood  yet.  The  detailed  characterization  of  the  corre-
lation  between  the  binding  sequence  motifs  in  the  ODD 
domain  and  its  binding  to  multiple  target  proteins  is 
necessary  for  understanding  the  versatile  function  of  the 
HIF1α ODD  domain.  Two  functionally  independent  se-
quence  motifs,  the  N-terminal  and  C-terminal  ODD 
(NODD  and  CODD),  in  the  HIF1α ODD  domain  were 
shown  to  bind  to  the  DNA-binding  domain  (DBD)  of  p53 
(Hansson  et al.,  2002).  The  crystal  structure  of  the 
CODD  motif  in  complex  with  pVHL  was  determined  to

tional  activation  domain,  respectively.  Pro402,  Pro564,  and

explain  the  structural  basis  for  the  recognition  of  hy-
droxyproline  in  the  CODD  motif  by  pVHL  (Hon  et al., 
2002;  Min et al.,  2002).  In  this  study,  we  performed  mo-
lecular  dynamics  simulation  of  the  structure  of  the  com-
plex  between  the  CODD  motif  and  the  p53  DBD  and 
compared  it  with  the  structure  of  the  complex  between 
the  CODD  motif  and  pVHL.  The  results  demonstrate 
specific  functional  roles  of  highly  conserved  amino  acids 
in  the  HIF1α ODD  motif  for  the  recognition  of  p53.

Methods
To  build  a  structural  model  of  a  HIF1α CODD  peptide 
(residues  560∼577)  in  complex  with  the  p53  DBD,  we 
performed  molecular  dynamics  simulation  by  using  the 

molecular  modeling  package  InsightII  (Accelrys).  The  ini-
tial  structure  of  the  HIF1α CODD  peptide  was  obtained 
from  the  structure  of  the  hydroxylated  peptide  bound  to 
pVHL  (PDB  code  1LQB)  (Hon  et al.,  2002).  Based  on 
the  contact  points  from  previous  chemical  shift  pertur-
bation  data  (Hansson  et al.,  2002),  the  CODD  peptide 
was  manually  docked  in  an  extended  structure  on  the 
binding  groove  of  the  crystal  structure  of  DNA-free  p53 
DBD  (PDB  code  2OCJ)  (Wang  et al.,  2007).  To  get  rid 
of  steric  clashes,  conjugate  gradient  minimization  of  the 
modeled  structure  was  performed  by  the  program 

DISCOVER  until  0.01  kcal/mol/Å was  reached.  This  was 

followed  by  500-ps  molecular  dynamics  simulation  at 
300  K,  in  which  the  backbones  of  the  molecule  were 
restrained.  During  the  molecular  dynamics  simulation,

the  CODD  peptide  and  p53  DBD  were  tethered  with  a 
force  constant  of  10,  and  the  integration  time  step  was 
1  fs.  Finally,  the  structure  was  further  subjected  to  con-
jugate  gradient  minimization  until  convergence  to  0.01 

kcal/mol/Å.  Molecular  dynamics  calculations  and  energy 

minimization  of  the  complex  molecule  were  carried  out 
with  a  consistent  valence  forcefield.  Figures  were  pre-
pared  by  using  the  software  InsightII. 

Results  and  Discussion

Two  functionally  independent  sequence  motifs,  NODD 
and  CODD,  in  the  HIF1α ODD  domain  were  shown  to 
bind  to  partner  proteins,  such  as  pVHL  and  p53 
(Hansson  et al.,  2002;  Hon et al.,  2002).  To  further  in-
vestigate  the  sequence  conservation  between  HIF1α 
homologs  from  different  species,  we  performed  multiple 
sequence  alignment  with  HIF1α homologs  from  human, 
monkey,  pig,  rat,  mouse,  chicken,  frog  (Xenopus laevis), 
and  zebrafish  (Fig.  2).  The  sequence  alignment  by  the 
program  ClustalW  (Larkin et al.,  2007)  demonstrates  that 
there  are  two  sequence  motifs  (NODD  and  CODD)  that 
display  noticeably  high  conservation  of  the  primary  se-
quence  across  different  species  and  isoforms.  The 
NODD  motif  corresponds  to  residues  387∼420,  where-
as  the  CODD  motif  encompasses  residues  549∼582.  In 
particular,  the  leucine-alanine-proline  (LAP)  motif,  which 
contains  the  hydroxylation  sites  Pro402  and  Pro564,  is 
common  in  both  the  NODD  and  CODD  motifs.  On  the 
other  hand,  only  the  CODD  motif  is  conserved  in  human 
HIF3α (Hara et al.,  2001)  (data  not  shown).  The  abso-
lutely  conserved  amino  acid  residues  in  the  CODD  motif 
include  residues  557∼560,  562∼569,  and  571∼574 

(Fig.  2).  It  is  interesting  to  see  how  the  same  sequence 
motif  is  capable  of  recognizing  different  partner  proteins 
with  high  specificity.  Also,  it  remains  unclear  why  the 
two  functionally  independent  N-  and  C-terminal  ODD 
motifs  in  HIF1α are  necessary  for  binding  to  partner 
proteins  such  as  pVHL  and  p53.  One  possibility  is  that 
the  presence  of  two  redundant  sequence  motifs  may  be 
associated  with  the  oligomeric  status  of  the  partner  pro-
teins  (such  as  a  tetramer,  in  the  case  of  p53)  (Hansson 
et al.,  2002;  Jeffrey  et al.,  1995). 
    The  peptide-based  binding  screening  by  Hansson  et 
al.  identified  that  the  peptides  that  encompass  the 
CODD  motif  bind  to  the  p53  DBD  with  micromolar  affin-
ity  in  solution  (Hansson et al.,  2002).  A  previous  chem-
ical  shift  analysis  for  the  CODD  peptide  by  NMR 
showed  that  the  conformation  of  the  hydroxylated 
CODD  peptide  was  nearly  identical  to  that  of  the  un-
modified  CODD  peptide  in  solution  (Hon  et al.,  2002). 
Therefore,  on  the  basis  of  the  extended  structure  of  the 
hydroxylated  peptide,  we  generated  an  initial  model  of 
the  CODD  peptide  (residues  560∼577)  for  docking  and 
molecular  dynamics  simulation.  Based  on  previous 
chemical  shift  perturbation  data  (Hansson  et al.,  2002), 
we  built  an  initial  structural  model  of  the  CODD-p53 
DBD  complex  and  carried  out  molecular  dynamics  simu-
lation  for  the  structure  of  the  CODD-p53  DBD  complex. 
    Fig.  3  shows  the  structure  of  the  CODD-p53  DBD 
complex  that  was  derived  from  the  molecular  dynamics 
simulation.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3A,  the  CODD  peptide  mol-
ecule  occupies  the  DNA-binding  site  of  the  p53  DBD. 
The  structural  model  for  the  CODD-p53  DBD  complex  is 
in  good  agreement  with  previous  chemical  shift  pertur-
bation  data.  Among  the  p53  DBD  residues  that  show

Role  of  a  Conserved  Sequence  Motif  in  the  HIF1α ODD  Domain    75

significant  chemical  shift  perturbations  (Hansson  et al., 
2002),  His115,  Thr118,  Thr231,  Val122,  His233,  Arg280,  and 
Thr284  are  in  direct  contact  with  the  CODD  peptide  (Fig. 
3B,  Table  1).  On  the  other  hand,  the  chemical  shift  per-
turbations  in  Tyr126  and  His178  are  likely  to  arise  not  from 
direct  contact  but  from  conformational  change,  because 
they  are  distant  from  the  binding  site.  The  binding  of  the 
CODD  peptide  to  the  p53  DBD  is  mediated  at  two  dif-
ferent  sites  of  the  p53  DBD.  The  residues  564∼571  in 
the  CODD  peptide  bind  to  the  primary  binding  site,  and 
residues  572∼577  bind  to  the  secondary  binding  site. 
The  primary  binding  site  of  the  p53  DBD  is  composed 
of  loop  1  and  helix  2,  and  the  secondary  site  consists 
of  the  β-strands  3,  5,  and  8.  The  interactions  between 
the  CODD  peptide  and  the  p53  DBD  are  mainly 
hydrophobic.  The  high  binding  specificity  of  the  complex 
seems  to  be  gained  through  the  extensive  involvement 
of  side  chains  of  the  CODD  peptide  that  are  in  direct 
contact  with  the  p53  DBD,  which  is  similar  to  what  has 
been  observed  for  the  CODD-pVHL  complex.  In  con-
clusion,  the  highly  conserved  CODD  motif  provides  a 
conserved  binding  mode  and  an  elaborate  binding  spe-
cificity  for  the  recognition  of  p53.

    On  the  basis  of  the  three-dimensional  structure  model, 
we  investigated  the  specific  functional  roles  of  highly 
conserved  residues  in  the  CODD  motif  for  the  recog-
nition  of  the  p53  DBD.  The  major  binding  determinants 
of  the  CODD  motif  that  are  involved  in  direct  contact 
with  the  p53  DBD  are  listed  in  Table  1.  In  particular, 
among  the  highly  conserved  residues,  the  residues 
Pro564,  Ile566,  Phe572,  Leu574,  and  Phe577  participate  in  key 
hydrophobic  interactions  and  major  van  der  Waals  con-
tacts  with  the  p53  DBD  residues.  On  the  other  hand, 
Asp571  forms  a  hydrogen  bond  with  Ser116  in  the  p53 
DBD.  The  other  conserved  residues  seem  to  play  a 
scaffolding  role  by  precisely  positioning  the  contacting 
residues  for  optimal  interaction  with  the  p53  DBD.  The 
major  binding  determinants  for  pVHL  binding  differ 
slightly  from  those  for  p53  binding,  indicating  that  the 
specific  role  of  each  conserved  residue,  albeit  within  the 
same  CODD  motif,  is  dependent  on  the  partner  protein. 
This  may  explain  how  the  same  sequence  motif  is  capa-
ble  of  recruiting  different  partner  proteins  with  high 
specificity.
    One  of  the  most  striking  differences  is  that  hydrox-
ylation  at  Pro564  is  essential  for  binding  pVHL  but  not  for 
binding  the  p53  DBD.  The  steady-state  affinity  constant 
of  VCB  (pVHL,  elongins  C  and  B)  for  the  unmodified 
CODD  peptide  was  estimated  to  be  approximately 
1000-fold  less  than  the  affinity  for  the  hydroxylated 
CODD  peptide  (Hon et al.,  2002).  This  drastic  reduction 
in  binding  affinity  stems  from  the  loss  of  two  hydrogen 
bonds  due  to  the  absence  of  a  hydroxyl  group  in  Pro564. 
Contrary  to  this,  binding  of  the  CODD  motif  to  the  p53 
DBD  does  not  depend  on  the  hydroxylation  of  Pro564. 
Fig.  4  shows  a  structural  comparison  of  the  CODD-p53 
DBD  complex  with  the  CODD-pVHL  complex.  Pro564  is 
rather  solvent-exposed  on  the  shallow  binding  groove  of

the  p53  DBD  (Fig.  4A),  whereas  Hyp564  is  deeply  buried 
in  the  deep  binding  pocket  of  pVHL  (Fig.  4B).  This 
structural  difference  in  the  binding  pocket  may  explain 
why  the  hydroxylation  of  Pro564  is  required,  not  for  p53 
DBD  binding,  but  for  pVHL  binding. 
    In  conclusion,  the  multiple  sequence  alignment  of 
ODD  domains  of  many  HIF1α homologs  shows  that  the 
NODD  and  CODD  motifs  are  highly  conserved  between 
various  species.  This  evolutionary  sequence  conserva-
tion  correlates  with  the  functional  importance  of  the 
NODD  and  CODD  motifs  for  their  recognition  of  partner 
proteins  such  as  pVHL  and  p53.  The  structure  of  the 
HIF1α CODD  motif  in  complex  with  the  p53  DBD  from 
our  molecular  dynamics  calculation  shows  that  the  side 
chains  of  highly  conserved  amino  acids  are  in  extensive 
contact  with  the  residues  in  the  p53  DBD,  demonstrat-
ing  specific  functional  roles  of  major  binding  determi-
nants  in  the  HIF1α  CODD  motif.  The  structure  also 
provides  useful  information  for  designing  small  mole-
cules  that  modulate  HIF1α-p53  interactions  in  tumor 
hypoxia.
