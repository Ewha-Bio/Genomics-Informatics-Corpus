The  harshness  of  legionellosis  differs  from  mild  Pontiac  fever  to  potentially  fatal  Legionnaire’s  disease.  The  increasing 
development of drug resistance against legionellosis has led to explore new novel drug targets. It has been found that 
phosphoglucosamine  mutase,  phosphomannomutase,  and  phosphoglyceromutase  enzymes  can  be  used  as  the  most 
probable therapeutic drug targets through extensive data mining. Phosphoglucosamine mutase is involved in amino sugar 
and nucleotide sugar metabolism. The purpose of this study was to predict the potential target of that specific drug. For this, 
the 3D structure of phosphoglucosamine mutase of Legionella pneumophila (strain Paris) was determined by means of 
homology modeling through Phyre2 and refined by ModRefiner. Then, the designed model was evaluated with a structure 
validation  program,  for  instance,  PROCHECK,  ERRAT,  Verify3D,  and  QMEAN,  for  further  structural  analysis.  Secondary 
structural features were determined through self-optimized prediction method with alignment (SOPMA) and interacting 
networks by STRING. Consequently, we performed molecular docking studies. The analytical result of PROCHECK showed 
that 95.0% of the residues are in the most favored region, 4.50% are in the additional allowed region and 0.50% are in the 
generously allowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Verify3D graph value indicates a score of 0.71 and 89.791, 1.11 for 
ERRAT and QMEAN respectively. Arg419, Thr414, Ser412, and Thr9 were found to dock the substrate for the most favorable 
binding of S-mercaptocysteine. However, these findings  from this current  study will  pave the  way for further extensive 
investigation of this enzyme in wet lab experiments and in that way assist drug design against legionellosis.

Introduction

Legionella  pneumophila  is  a  gram-negative  intracellular 
facultative  pathogen  that  is  mainly  responsible  behind 
hospital  and  community-acquired  legionellosis  and  about 
90% cases of legionellosis are caused by this species [1]. 
Legionellosis  patients  predominantly  have  pneumonia, 
chills,  fever  even  their  cough  likely  to  be  dry  or  phlegm 

nature. L. pneumophila isolation by comparing clinical and 
environmental  L.  pneumophila  isolates  precludes  different 
sources whether it is contagious or not through a number of 
typing methods. Such methods of typing make it’s easier like 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), is usually considered 
to be extremely biased [2-6]. PFGE can recognize unique 
strains  of  L.  pneumophila  with  a  precise  profile  that  is 
considered sporadic. The origin of L. pneumophila sg 1 clone 
was identified at 1997. In Paris, legionellosis was caused by

a single L. pneumophila sero group 1 strain [7]. An ample of 
enzymes  is  required  in  bacterial  metabolism.  Drugs 
resistance against L. pneumophila considered to the search for 
most novel drugs of designing. At present, computational 
analysis  was  taken  place  in  order  to  discover  novel  drug 
targets  that  are  non-homologous  to  human.  All  enzymes 
involved in metabolic pathway of those certain bacteria are 
precursor  to design  such  kind  of drugs.  Phosphoglucosa-
minemutase and phosphomannomutase, these two typically 
have  the  potential  target  sites.  Phosphomannomutase  is 
processed  with  glycosylation,  adding  the  groups  of  sugar 
molecules (oligosaccharides) to proteins. The enzyme pho-
sphoglucosamine  mutase  catalyzes  the  chemical  reaction 
alpha-D-glucosamine  1-phosphate  to  D-glucosamine  6- 
phosphate, which converts alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate 
to  D-glucosamine  6-phosphate.  This  enzyme  is  pheno-
menally the same as phosphomannomutase, which transfers 
a phosphate group within a molecule. The systematic name 
of  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  is  alpha-D-glucosamine 
1,6-phosphomutase. It participates in metabolism of amino 
sugars. Phosphoglucosamine mutase (GlmM) catalyzes the 
formation of glucosamine-1-phosphate from glucosamine- 
6-phosphate,  an  essential  step  in  the  pathway  for  UDP- 
N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis in bacteria. This enzyme 
must be phosphorylated to be active and acts according to a 
ping-pong mechanism involving glucosamine-1,6-diphosphate 
as  an  intermediate  [8].  The  phosphoglucosamine  mutase 
auto-phosphorylates in vitro in the presence of ATP. The same 
is pragmatic with phosphoglucosamine mutases from other 
bacterial  species,  yeast  N-acetylglucosamine-phosphate 
mutase, and rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase. Labeling 
of GlmM enzyme with ATP requires divalent cation. The label 
can  be  lost  if  it  is  incubated  more  vigorously  with  of  its 
substrates. At glycosylation, the phosphomannomutase enzyme 
converts mannose-6-phosphate to mannose-1-phosphate [9]. 
Mannose-1-phosphate  is  converted  into  GDP-mannose 
which transfers mannose to the growing oligosaccharides 
chain. Congenital disorder type Iais is initiated by mutations 
in  the  PMM2  gene.  Mutations  alter  the  formation  of 
phosphomannomutase  enzyme  that  lead  to  the  reduced 
enzyme activity and shortage of GDP mannose within cells. 
As  there  have  no  enough  activated  mannose,  incorrect 
oligosaccharides  are  produced.  Abnormal  glycosylated 
proteins  in  organs  and  tissues  regulate  the  signs  and 
symptoms in CDG-Ia [10]. In addition, it participates in the 
metabolism of both fructose and mannose.

So, homology modeling will predict the desired function 
and  possible  disease  treatment  if  needed  because  of  its 
importance on cell metabolism systems. The present study is 
aimed  to  predict  the  three-dimensional  (3D)  structure  of 
phosphoglucosamine mutase by means of homology modeling. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

Consequently,  to  depict  its  structural  features  and  to 
comprehend the molecular function, the structural model 
for the desired protein was constructed.

Methods 
Sequence retrieval

The  amino  acid  sequences  of  the  enzyme  phospho-
glucosamine mutase in L. pneumophilia (strain Paris) were 
retrieved  from  the  UniProt Knowledge  Base  (UniProtKB) 
database, which is the foremost hub for the compilation of 
well-designed  information  on  proteins,  with  consistent, 
accurate,  and  rich  annotation.  The  accession  ID  of 
phosphoglucosamine  mutase  is  Q5X1A3,  and  it  contains 
455 amino acids.

Analysis of physico-chemical properties

ProtParam (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/), a tool of 
Expasy was used for the analysis of the physiological and 
chemical properties from the protein sequence. This tool can 
predict different physico-chemical properties, like the molec-
ular weight, isoelectric pH, aliphatic index, grand average of 
hydropathicity (GRAVY), and extinction coefficients.

Secondary structure prediction

Secondary  structure  was  predicted  by  using  the  self- 
optimized prediction method with alignment (SOPMA) [11]. 
The protein’s secondary structure includes an  helix, 310 
helix, pi helix, beta bridge, extended strand, beta turns, bend 
region,  random  coil,  ambiguous  states,  and  other  states. 
SOPMA  predicts  these  properties  by  using  homologous 
protein identification, sequence alignment, and conforma-
tional score determination method. Prediction accuracy was 
confirmed by correlation coefficient value. Plain text format 
data were inputted, and default parameters were set.

Protein-protein interaction networking 

Protein  cooperates  with  other  proteins  to  perform 
accurate functions. To identify protein-protein interactions, 
STRING was used. STRING is a biological database that is 
used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
for different known and predicted interactions. At present, 
the database covers up to 5,214,234 proteins from 1,133 
organisms [12].

Model building 

3D structure determination of a protein is the key step of 
structural  genomics  initiative  [13].  To  predict  the  3D 
homology  model  of  phosphoglucosamine  mutase,  Phyre2 
(Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine) [14], the 
most popular online protein fold identification server, was 

www.genominfo.org

269

A Hasan,  et  al.  Molecular Characterization of Phosphoglucosamine Mutase from Legionella pneumophila

used. Phyre2 uses a dataset of known proteins taken from 
different reliable databases, such as Structural Classification 
of Proteins (SCOP) database and Protein Data Bank (PDB). 
Through  sequential  steps,  such  as  profile  construction, 
similarity analysis, and structural properties, Phyre2 selects 
the best suited template and generates a protein model. To 
get an accurate model, intensive mode of protein modeling 
was selected. The input data of this enzyme were in FASTA 
format.  In  this  respect,  the  intensive  mode  of  protein 
modeling was selected in order to get an accurate model. 
After model building, it is necessary to further refine in quest 
of the best model generation.

Model refinement

Homology-based  modeling  often  contains  significant 
local distortions that render the structure models less useful 
for  high-resolution  functional  analysis.  To  refine  the 
predicted protein model, ModRefiner [15], an algorithm for 
atomic-level, high-resolution protein structure refinement, 
was  used.  Protein  sequences  were  given  in  the  FASTA 
format, and refinement was done for several times to get the 
most accurate structure.

Evaluation and validation of the model

The accuracy and stereo chemical quality of the predicted 
model  were  evaluated  with  PROCHECK  [16,  17]  by 
Ramachandran plot [18] analysis, which was done through 
“Protein structure and model assessment tools” of Swiss- 
model  workspace;  2.5  Å  resolution  was  selected  for 
PROCHECK analysis. The best model was selected on the 
basis of overall G-factor, number of residues in the core, and 
allowed, generously allowed, and disallowed regions. ERRAT 
[19], Verify3D [20], and Qualitative Model Energy Analysis 
(QMEAN) [21] were used for further analysis of the selected 
model. The verified structure was visualized by Swiss-PDB 
Viewer [22].

Active site analysis

The active site is the specific region of the target protein 
responsible  for  its  activity and is constructed of different 
amino acids. To identify the active site with the determined 
model, Computed Atlas of Surface Topography of proteins 
(CASTp)  [23]  server  was  used.  This  provides  an  online 
resource for locating, delineating, and measuring concave 

surface regions on three-dimensional structures of proteins, 
including  pockets  located  on  protein  surfaces  and  voids 
buried in the interior of proteins.

Docking simulation study

Molecular docking is a computer simulation procedure to 
calculate the conformation of a receptor-ligand complex. It is 
used to identify the binding affinity and interaction energy of 
the molecules with the target protein. Docking analysis was 
performed by AutoDock Vina [24], which is an automated 
procedure  for  predicting  the  interaction  of  ligands  with 
bio-macromolecular  targets.  Before  initiating  the  docking 
stimulations,  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  protein  was 
modified by adding polar hydrogen, removing all the water 
molecules, and was also set with the grid box for its binding 
site, whereas all the torsional bonds of ligands were set free 
by the ligand module. To evaluate the binding energy on the 
macromolecule  coordinate,  a  three-dimensional  grid  box 
(box size, 76 × 76 × 76 Å; box center, 11 × 90.5 × 57.5 for 
x, y, and z, respectively) was created using Auto Grid, which 
calculates the grid map. The combined binding with target 
protein  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  and 
ligand,  s- 
mercaptocysteine,  was  obtained  by  using  PyMOL  (The 
PyMOL  Molecular  Graphics  System,  version  1.5.0.4, 
Schrödinger, LLC) [25].

Results and Discussion

The  UniProt  Knowledge  Base  (UniProtKB)  delivers  an 
authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional 
information.  Sequences  of  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  of 
Legionella  pneumophilia  (strain  Paris)  were  obtained  from 
UniProtKB.  Manual  annotation  is  the  landmark  of  the 
SwissProt  section  of  UniProtKB  [26,  27].  The  protein 
sequence  was  analyzed  using  the  ProtParam  server  [28], 
which can predict the physical and chemical parameters for 
the protein. The parameters of this server are helpful for 
experimental handling of the protein, like biological analysis 
or extraction.

ProtParam  results  reveal  that  the  protein  has  23,295 
extinction  coefficients,  27.68  instability  index,  108.00 
aliphatic index, and 0.059 grand average of hydrophobicity, 
with  more  positively  charged  residues  than  negatively 
charged  amino  acids.  The  physico-chemical  properties  of

Secondary structure analysis is increasing day by day to 
predict  protein  function  and  structure.  The  secondary

PPI network generation has become very important tool of 
the modern biomedical research arena for the understanding 
of  complex  molecular  mechanisms  and  the  detection  of 
novel modulators of disease processes. These types of work 
have been shown to be very important in the study of a wide 
range of human diseases, as well as their signaling pathways 
[29-31]. PPI of phosphoglucosamine mutase was generated 
through STRING, presented in Fig. 2. STRING forecasts a 
confidence score and 3D structures of protein and protein 
domains. Confidence scores were generated on the basis of 
different  parameters,  like  neighborhood,  co-occurrence, 
coexpression,  and  homology.  STRING  utilizes  references 
from UniProt and predicts functions of different interacting 
proteins.  PPI  network  demonstrates  that  phosphogluco-
samine mutase interacts with 10 other proteins, such as mur 
E is hypothetical protein with a confidence score of 0.687; 
glmU  is  bifunctional  N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate 
(Glc-N-1-P) uridyltransferase/glucosamine-1-phosphate N- 
acetyltransferase  (UDP-GlcNAc),  which  catalyzes  the  last 
two  sequential  reactions  in  the  de  novo  biosynthetic 
pathway  for  UDP-GlcNAc.  It  is  also  responsible  for  the 
acetylation  of  Glc-N-1-P  to  give  GlcNAc-1-P  and  for  the 
uridyl  transfer  from  UTP  to  GlcNAc-1-P,  which  produces 
UDP-GlcNAc. This protein is closely related to glmM with the 
highest confidence score (0.998). The second highest confi-

dence  protein  is  glmS,  glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate 
aminotransferase,  which  catalyzes  the  first  step  in  hexo-
samine metabolism, converting fructose-6P into glucosamine- 
6P using glutamine as a nitrogen source. Another important 
protein,  murC  (confidence  score,  0.667),  UDP-N-acetyl-
muramate-L-alanine ligase, works in cell wall formation.

Homology  modeling  of  the  unique  and  essential 
metabolic  protein  was  done  by  using  Phyre2  in  order  to 
obtain the 3D structure of them. 3D protein structures give 
important  insights  about  the  molecular  basis  of  protein 
function  and  thereby  allow  an  effective  design  of  experi-
ments [32]. That is why, in the understanding and manipula-
tion  of  biochemical  and  cellular  functions  of  proteins,  the 
high-resolution 3D structure of a protein is the main key [19]. 
Phyre2 generated the best suited result, showing that the 
predicted structure had a 100% confidence level and uses the 
template c3pdkB. Secondary structure and disorder predic-
tion leads to a conclusion that phosphoglucosamine mutase 
has disordered region of 4%. To gain a more accurate model, 
refinement through ModRefiner was done.

After  derivation  by  the  ModRefiner,  the  refined  model 
(Fig.  3)  of  the  desired  enzyme  was  analyzed  for  further 
advancement. In the initial model of phosphoglucosamine 
mutase, the percent of residues in the favored region in the 
Ramachandran  plot  was  84.0%  versus  95.0%  in  the  final 
model. The red, brown, and yellow colored regions are the 
symbol  of  the  favored,  allowed,  and  generously  allowed 
regions, respectively, the same as defined by PROCHECK 
(Fig. 4). Parameters, such as residue in the favored, allowed, 
and  generously  allowed  region  and  G-factor,  are  the

determinants of a good model [33-35].

Subsequent to that, PROCHECK was used to measure the 
accuracy of protein models. Parameter comparisons of these 
proteins were made with well-refined structures that have 
similar resolution. Through PROCHECK analysis, specific 
information  about  the  protein  chains  and  their  stereo-
chemical  quality,  like Ramachandran plot  quality,  peptide 
bond  planarity,  bad  non-bonded  interactions,  main  chain 
hydrogen bond energy, C alpha chirality, and overall G factor, 
and the side chain parameters like standard deviations of 
chi1 gauche minus, can be obtained [36]. Ramachandran 
plot statistics of phosphoglucosamine mutase revealed that 
most of the amino acid residues (above 90% of amino acid 
residues) were present in most favored regions (Table 3). 
Thus, the protein model was very good, seeing that all of the 
residues were within the limits of the Ramachandran plot.
Verification  was  also  done  by  ERRAT,  Verify3D,  and 
QMEAN server. ERRAT uses a quadratic error function to 
characterize  and  differentiate  between  correctly  and 
incorrectly determined regions of protein structures based 
on characteristic atomic interaction [37]. The overall quality 
of the model by ERRAT analysis was 89.791. The Verify3D 
graph value of the model is 0.71, which indicates that the 
environmental  profile  of  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  is 
quite good [38-40]. On the basis of a linear combination of 
six  structural  descriptions,  the  QMEAN  scoring  function 
estimates  the  global  quality  of  the  models.  The  local 
geometry model analysis is done by a torsion angel potential 
over three consecutive amino acids, and the quality of the 
model  can  be  compared  to  a  reference  structure  of  high 
resolution  obtained  from  X-ray  crystallography  analysis 
through Z score. QMEAN Z-score provides an estimation of 
the “degree of nativeness” of the structural features observed

quality to experimental structures [41].

The  assessing  of  long-range  interactions  is  carried 
through  secondary  structure  specific  distance-dependent

describes  the  burial  status  of  the  residues.  Secondary

The  respective  values  of  Z-scores  of  C_  interaction 
energy,  solvation  energy,  torsion  angle  energy,  secondary 
structure, and solvent accessibility are 0.28, −1.03, −1.20, 
1.43, and 1.12 in the case of phosphoglucosamine mutase, as 
shown in Table 4. The overall QMEAN score for phospho-
glucosamine  mutase  is  1.11.  QMEAN-generated  results 
confer phosphoglucosamine mutase as a qualified model for 
further drug target scopes.

The  active  site  of  phosphoglucosamine  mutase  was

have also reported the best active site area of the experi-

molecular docking study will assist efficient inhibitor design 
against legionellosis in the future. 

molecular weight of 153.22 g/mol (Table 6), was found to 
bind at the active site of phosphoglucosamine mutase with 
the lowest binding energy (Fig. 6). It has been clear that 
s-mercaptocysteine formed similar hydrogen bond interac-
tions  with  phosphoglucosamine  mutase.  From  the  active 
site  analysis,  41  amino  acid  residues  were  found  in  the 
potent active site. The interaction between the active site 
residues and the ligand found in our present study is useful 
for perceiving the potential mechanism of residues and the 
drug binding. The hydrogen bonds play a significant role for 
the structure and function of biological molecules, and we 
found  significant  results.  Among  the  41  residues,  Thr9, 
Arg246,  Val306,  Gly307,  Asp308,  Ser412,  and  Thr414 
interacted  with  the  ligand;  the  others  did  not.  Docking 
analysis  with  ligand  identified  specific  residues—viz. 
Thr414,  Ser412,  and  Thr9  (Fig.  7)−within  the  phos-
phoglucosamine mutase binding pocket to play an important 
role in ligand binding affinity, which further itself inhibits its 
function and exposes studies about new drug discovery.

The putative drug targets phosphoglucosamine mutase, 
phosphoglyceromutase,  and  phosphomannomutase  for 
legionellosis  have  been  reported  as  potential  in  the 
literature.  That  is  why  in  our  study,  the  3D  structure  of 
phosphoglucosamine  mutase  from  L.  pneumophila  (strain 
Paris)  was  predicted  and  validated  by  a  variety  of 
bioinformatics tools and software. Analyzing the results, it 
could  be  concluded  that  future  characterization  of  phos-
phoglucosamine mutase from L. pneumophila (strain Paris) will 
be  noteworthy  for  the  regulation  of  legionellosis.  The 
modeled 3D structure will provide a good-quality foundation 
for experimental development of the crystal structure, and the
