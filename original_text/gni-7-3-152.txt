Abstract

Although  the  genetic  basis  for  bone  mineral  density 
(BMD)  has  been  studied  by  many  groups  so  far,  genes 
responsible  for  this  complex  trait  has  not  been  com-
pletely  revealed.  In  order  to  localize  quantitative  trait  loci 
(QTLs)  for  BMD  variation  in  Asian  population,  the  study 
was  designed  using  a  group  of  Mongolian  population,  a 
genetically  closed  population  with  a  homogeneous 
lifestyle.  BMD  was  measured  at  the  left  and  right  wrists 
and  ankles  using  DEXA  in  1,082  participants  from  142 
families.  Genotyping  of  13  polymorphic  microsatellite 
markers  on  chromosome  13  (average  spacing  8-9  cM) 
and  two-point  and  multipoint  linkage  analysis  were 
performed.  In  two-point  linkage  analysis,  we  identified 
two  markers,  D13S175  (6.03  cM)  and  D13S265  (68.73 
cM)  that  had  LOD  scores  greater  than  1  for  left  ankle 
(LOD=2.09,  LOD=1.49,  respectively).  We  also  found  a 
marker  D13S175  (6.03  cM)  with  a  high  LOD  for  left  wrist 
(LOD=1.49)  and  the  markers  D13S265  (68.73  cM)  and 
D13S217  (17.21  cM)  for  the  right  wrist  (LOD=  1.82, 
LOD=  1.62,  respectively).  Among  these  significant  mark-
er  regions,  only  two  regions  at  17  cM  (13p11)  and  65 
cM  (13q21)  for  the  right  wrist  overlapped  with  major 
QTLs  reported  in  following  multipoint  linkage  analysis 
(LOD=  1.7549,  LOD=1.4462,  respectively).  This  study 
provides  the  possible  evidence  of  the  presence  of  QTLs 
affecting  right  wrist  BMD  in  Mongolian  populations  on 
13p11  and  13q21.  Modest  evidence  was  also  found  for 
genes  affecting  left  ankle  and  left  wrist  BMD  on  13p13.

Introduction

than  before 

increasingly  significant 

Osteoporosis  is  the  primary  risk  factor  for  osteoporotic 
fractures  which  lead  to  significantly  elevated  morbidity 
and  mortality  in  elderly  (Streeten et al.,  2006).  As  pop-
ulations  age  in  both  developed  and  developing  world, 
the  magnitude  of  this  global  public  health  problem  will 
become 
(WHO 
Scientific  group  2003).  Previous  studies  have  shown  that 
multiple  factors  influence  the  peak  bone  mass,  including 
genes,  hormonal  influences,  lifestyle  and  environmental 
exposures  (Jouanny  et al.,  1995).  Specifically,  calcium 
intake,  physical  activity,  and  BMI  may  play  important 
roles  in  peak  bone  mass,  suggesting  that  nutritional  and 
genetic  factors  may  interact  to  influence  bone  modeling. 
There  are  several  lines  of  evidence  that  support  the  ge-
netic  influence  on  bone  mineral  density  (BMD).  Twin 
studies  have  shown  that  BMD  is  highly  heritable,  with 
genes  accounting  for  60∼88%  of  the  total  variation  in 
BMD  (Barthe et al.,  1998;  Pocock et al.,  1987).  Familial 
aggregation  studies  have  shown  that  the  risk  of  osteo-
porotic  fracture  is  elevated  in  the  first  degree  relatives 
of  probands  with  osteoporosis  (Barthe  et al.,  1998). 
    Genetic  linkage  analysis  and  candidate  genes  associ-
ation  studies  have  implicated  several  chromosomal  loci 
and  multiple  candidate  genes  (Jin  and  Ralston,  2005). 
To  date,  more  than  10  studies  have  performed  genome- 
wide  linkage  scans  to  localize  quantitative  trait  loci 
(QTLs)  that  modulate  BMD,  and  these  studies  have 
identified  several  QTLs.  However,  only  a  limited  number 
of  loci  have  been  replicated  across  studies.  Strongest 
support  for  linkage  has  been  observed  for  chromosome 
1p36  influencing  hip  BMD  (Devoto et al.,  2001).  In  addi-
tion,  1q21,  4q32,  12q24,  13q14  and  16p13  have  been 
implicated  for  BMD.  However,  only  a  few  studies  have 
performed  a  genome  wide  linkage  analysis  in  Asian 
populations  to  localize  the  region  that  may  harbor  sus-
ceptibility  genes  for  BMD  (Hsu  et al.,  2007). 
    In  the  present  study,  we  examined  randomly  selected 
extended  families  from  a  region  of  Mongolia  to  under-
stand  the  epidemiologic  characteristics  of  bone  health 
indices  (BHI)  as  surrogates  for  bone  mineral  density;  to 
assess  the  magnitude  of  heritability  of  BHI;  and  to  per-
form  variance  component  linkage  analysis  for  chromo-
some  13. 

Methods

Study  population

The  study  population  was  recruited  from  the  residents 
of  Orhontuul  soum,  Selenge  aimag,  Mongolia.  The  study 
using  a  Mongolian  population  was  designed  for  its  ge-
netically  closed  population  with  a  homogeneous  lifestyle. 
We  studied  a  total  of  1,082  individuals  from  142  Mongo-
lian  families.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  study  included  a 
slightly  higher  proportion  of  females  compared  with 
males  (56.7%  vs.  43.3%,  respectively).  Ages  for  partic-
ipants  ranged  from  5  to  82  years;  37.6%  in  ages  0∼19, 
13.4%  in  20∼29,  19.7%  in  30∼39,  12.7%  in  40∼49 
and  16.6%  in  50  and  up.  Female  participants  were 
somewhat  older  than  male  participants  (30.6  vs.  27.6, 
respectively). 

Genotyping

Venous  blood  samples  were  obtained  from  all  study 
participants  and  genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  the 
buffy  coat  of  blood  leukocytes.  Subjects  were  geno-
typed  at  thirteen  microsatellite  markers  with  an  average 
spacing  of  8.5  cM  using  ABI  Prism  Linkage  Mapping  set 
version  2.5  (Applied  Biosystems  Inc.  CA,  USA)  (Supple-
mentary  Table  1).  PCR  amplification  was  done  and  the 
software  ABI  300  DNA  sequence  and  GENESCAN  3.7 
was  used  for  analysis.  Prior  to  performing  linkage  analy-
sis,  we  checked  for  deviations  from  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium  and  Mendelian  inconsistencies  in  marker  da-
ta  using 
(O'Connell  and 
Weeks,  1998).

the  PEDCHECK  program 

Bone  densitometry

Bone  health  indices  (BHI)  as  surrogates  for  bone  mineral 
density  (BMD)  was  measured  using  a  dual  energy  X-ray 
absorptiometer  (DEXA,  Lunar  PIXI  densitometer,  GE 
Lunar  Corp.,  USA).
    BMD  was  measured  at  four  sites,  left  and  right  wrists, 
and  ankles.  Data  were  reported  as  BHI  in  grams/cm2.

Statistical  analyses

We  first  examined  distribution  of  bone  density  index  by 
age  and  sex.  We  examined  each  phenotype  to  see 
whether  it  is  normally  distributed.  Because  substantial 
changes  were  observed  by  broad  age  categories,  we 
stratified  subjects  into  10  year  interval,  and  computed 
the  mean  and  standard  deviation  for  BMD  at  the  wrists 
and  ankles.  T-scores  were  calculated  using  the  BMD 
means  and  standard  deviations  using  the  following 

equation:  T-score=(BMDsubject−Peak  BMD)/SDpeak  for 

ages  20  years  and  older.  Peak  adult  bone  mass  was 
defined  as  the  mean  BMD  of  the  age  group  with  the 
highest  mean  BMD  value.  Based  on  WHO  criteria  (WHO 

Scientific  group  2003),  subjects  with  a  T-score≤−2.5 
a  T-score  between −1  and −2.5  were  considered  to 

were  considered  to  have  osteoporosis,  and  those  with 

have  osteopenia.  All  descriptive  statistical  analyses  were 
performed  using  SPSS  version  12.0.
    We  performed  heritability  and  linkage  analyses  as  im-
plemented  in  SOLAR  version  4.0.7  (http://www.sfbr.org/ 
solar/4.0.7.doc).  BMD  at  the  four  different  sites  were 
used  as  phenotypes.  We  first  computed  heritability  for 
each  phenotype,  while  controlling  for  age,  sex  and  age 
by  sex.  For  each  trait  with  the  estimated  trait  standard 
deviation  under  0.5,  a  correction  factor  was  applied.  For 
left  ankle,  left  wrist,  right  ankle  and  right  wrist,  a  correc-
tion  factor  of  8.4,  9,  8.7,  and  9.7  was  multiplied  to 
BMD,  respectively.  We  compared  the  likelihood  for  a 
variance  component  model  where  the  additive  genetic 
variance  for  a  quantitative  trait  locus  (QTL)  (σ2
q)  was 
constrained  to  zero  vs.  the  likelihood  for  a  model  where 
σ2
q  was  estimated.  We  rejected  the  null  hypothesis  if

the  twice  the  difference  in  the  log  likelihood  yielded  a 
test  statistic  that  is  asymptotically  distributed  as  a  50:50 
mixture  of  a  χ2  distribution  with  one  degree  of  freedom 
and  a  point  mass  at  zero  (Self  and  Liang,  1987).  We 
then  performed 
linkage 
analysis.  To  test  for  linkage,  we  compared  the  likelihood 
for  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  additive  genetic  variance 
due  to  a  QTL  (σ2
q)  against  the  alternative  hypothesis 
that  estimates  σ2
q.  Twice  the  difference  in  the  natural 
log  likelihood  of  these  models  yields  a  test  statistic,  as 
described  above.

Results

We  studied  bone  health  index  in  1,452  individuals  in  142 
pedigrees.  These  include  452  nuclear  families  and  592 
founders. 
    Table  2  shows  that  the  mean  BMD  of  left  wrist  was 
slightly  higher  than  that  for  right  wrist  (0.44  vs.  0.43,  re-
spectively),  and  similarly,  the  mean  BMD  for  left  wrist 
was  somewhat  higher  than  that  for  left  ankle  (0.44  vs. 
0.41,  respectively).  As  expected,  the  mean  BMD  of 
males  were  higher  than  that  of  females.  The  peak  value 
of  mean  BMD  in  Mongolian  women  was  calculated  to 
compare  with  prior  studies  done  in  Japan  and  China.

Japan  had  a  peak  mean  BMD  value  of  0.359  g/cm2, 
China  0.451  g/cm2  and  Mongolia  0.485  g/cm2  which 
shows  Mongolian  women  to  have  the  highest  value.
    The  polynomial  regression  equations  describe  the  re-
lation  between  age  and  BMD  at  each  site  (Supplemen-
tary  Table  2).  The  cubic  regression  model  was  the  sim-
plest  model  that  significantly  improved  the  fit  to  the  da-
ta  at  every  site.  The  best  fitting  effect  (R2)  of  the  re-
gression  model  that  includes  age,  age2  and  age3  ex-
plains  70.5%  of  the  observed  variation  for  left  wrist, 
41.2%  for  left  ankle,  70.5%  for  right  wrist,  and  41.9% 
for  right  ankle. 
    Using  the  definition  of  osteoporosis  by  WHO  criteria, 
the  prevalence  of  osteoporosis  was  approximately  three- 
to  four-fold  higher  in  females  than  in  males  in  this 
population.  For  example,  42%  of  the  female  subjects 
met  the  criteria  of  osteoporosis  in  the  ankle  compared 
with  11∼12%  in  males  (Supplementary  Table  3).
    Variance  component  linkage  analysis  for  each  trait 
was  performed  using  13  microsatellite  markers.  After 
adjusting  for  age,  sex,  and  age  by  sex  in  the  polygenic

model,  estimates  for  total  additive  genetic  heritability 
(H2
r)  were  high  for  left  ankle  and  left  wrist  among  four 
different  sites.  H2
r  for  left  ankle  was  0.52  (p＜0.001),  left 
wrist  0.70  (p＜0.001).  On  the  other  hand,  compared  with 
heritability  estimates  for  left  wrist  and  ankle,  H2
r  was 
lower  for  right  ankle  0.03  (p=0.25)  and  right  wrist  0.24 
(p＜0.001)  (Fig.  1).
    Two-point  linkage  analysis  based  on  thirteen  micro-
satellite  markers  on  chromosome  13  revealed  that 
D13S175,  located  at  6.03  cM,  had  the  highest  two-point 
LOD  score  of  2.09  for  left  ankle,  1.49  for  left  wrist,  and 
0.42  for  right  ankle.  In  addition,  D13S265,  located  at 
68.73  cM  showed  evidence  of  linkage  for  the  BMD  val-
ue  for  right  wrist  (LOD=1.82),  and  for  left  ankle,  wrist  al-
so  (LOD=1.65,  LOD=1.16,  respectively)  (Fig.  2).
    For  the  two  markers  with  the  high  LOD  scores,  we 
then  examined  family-specific  LOD  scores  to  see  wheth-
er  these  linkage  signals  were  derived  from  a  subset  of 
families.  Each  analysis  showed  subsets  of  families  with 
high  LOD  scores.  In  the  analysis  on  left  ankle  and  wrist,

one  family  (pedigree  1)  had  the  highest  LOD  of  1.93  for

    Multipoint  linkage  analysis  was  performed  with  family 
47  deleted  due  to  technical  problems.  With  the  modified 
data  it  showed  several  suggestive  QTLs  for  BMD.  As 
shown  in  Table  3,  the  highest  LOD  score  for  left  ankle 
was  0.8229  on  13p13  at  0  cM  and  the  second  highest 
score  was  0.2116  on  13q21  on  60  cM  between  markers 
D13S179  and  D13S156.  For  BMD  at  left  wrist,  there 
were  also  two  suggestive  QTLs  which  were  0.7611  on 
13p13  and  0.4610  on  13q21  on  70  cM  between  markers 
D13S265  and  D13S779.  QTLs  for  BMD  of  right  ankle 
showed  highest  LOD  score  of  0.4103  on  13p13  at  0  cM. 
As  for  the  right  wrist  BMD,  we  identified  two  significant 
QTLs;  the  highest  LOD  score  being  1.7549  on  13p11at 
17  cM  and  the  other  having  a  LOD  score  of  1.4468  on 
13q21  at  69  cM  between  marker  D13S170  and 
D13S265.  The  multipoint  linkage  results  are  shown  in

Discussion

We  conducted  a  detailed  genetic  study  of  bone  health 
measures  using  measures  for  the  left  and  right  wrists 
and  ankles  in  members  of  multigenerational  families 
from  Mongolia.  We  show  that  in  this  population,  herit-
ability  estimates  for  left  wrist  and  left  ankle  exceeded 
0.5,  and  those  for  right  wrist  and  ankle  were  somewhat 
lower.  Linkage  analysis  localized  potential  QTL  to  two 
markers,  D13S175  (6.03  cM)  and  D13S265  (68.73  cM). 
    This  study  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  parse  ge-
netic  environmental  factors  that  influence  bone  health 
measures  using  a  large  set  of  family  data  in  Asian 
population.  This  population  appears  to  have  higher  bone 

health  measures  compared  with  other  Asian  pop-
ulations,  highlighting  the  importance  of  environmental 
factors.  Mongolian  population  appears  to  have  higher 
BMD  than  other  Asian  populations,  including  Japanese 
and  Chinese  populations  (Iki  et al.,  2001;  Wu  et al., 
2004).  Previous  studies  have  consistently  shown  that 
Asian  populations  have  lower  BMD  as  compared  with 
the  population  of  European  origin  (Wand  et al.,  1997). 
Some  of  the  findings  confirm  earlier  studies.  Compar-
ison  study  of  BMD  by  sex  have  shown  that  BMD  is  low-
er  in  females  than  in  males  by  about  8∼10%.  This  dif-
ference  between  genders  is  the  effect  of  men’s  larger 
bone  size  and  greater  bone  strength.  According  to 
Looker  and  colleagues,  men  had  significantly  higher 
BMD  values  than  women  to  around  10∼15%.  However, 
when  variables  like  bone  size  and  bone  strength  were 
corrected,  the  difference  was  decreased  to  1∼8% 
(Looker  et al.,  2000). 
    The  prevalence  of  osteoporosis  in  Mongolian  women 
over  age  50  was  19.2%  and  21.6%  in  left  and  right 
wrist.  This  prevalence  was  lower  than  that  reported  in 
the  Japanese  Population  Osteoporosis  Study  (Iki  et al., 
2001)  of  females  over  50  with  a  36.3%  prevalence  in 
the  distal  radius.  On  the  other  hand,  the  prevalence  in 
our  study  was  higher  than  that  of  other  ethnicities  with 
10.0%,  5.0%,  13.3%,  15.6%  and  15.1%  in  European, 
African,  Asian,  Hispanic,  and  native  American  origins, 
respectively,  over  50  years  measured  in  the  distal  fore-
arm  using  DEXA  (Barrett-Connor  et al.,  2005). 
    Heritability  estimates  exceed  50%  after  controlling  for 
covariates  that  are  important  for  bone  health.  Total  ad-
ditive  genetic  heritability  (H2
r)  of  the  BMD  were  found  to 
be  more  highly  heritable  in  the  left  ankle  and  wrist  than 
right.  This  is  congruent  with  the  expectation  in  that  right 
wrist  and  ankle  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  daily  activ-
ities  of  living;  therefore,  the  heritability,  an  estimate  of 
genetic  influence,  will  be  underestimated. 
    Prior  to  multipoint  analysis,  we  performed  two-point 
analysis  using  measures  of  wrists  and  ankles.  We  found 
two  significantly 
for  BMD-LA  and 
BMD-LW  on  marker  D13S175  at  6.03  cM  and  D13S265 
at  68.73  cM  with  a  LOD  greater  than  1.  In  BMD-RA,  the 
two  markers  showing  the  highest  LOD  were  D13S175 
and  D13S217  but  this  result  seems  less  feasible  for  two 
reasons:  the  heritability  is  too  low  (H2
r=0.03)  and  the 
highest  LOD  is  less  than  1.  As  for  BMD-RW,  the  two 
highest  LOD  appeared  in  marker  D13S265  and  D13S217 
(Fig.  2).  This  possibly  suggests  that  genes  may  regulate 
BMD  differently  at  different  skeletal  sites  and  that 
gene-environmental  interactions  may  also  play  an  im-
portant  role.  Nevertheless,  all  markers  for  high  LOD  of 
the  four  different  traits  were  located  between  6.03  cM 
and  68.73  cM  on  chromosome  13.  This  suggests  that 

regions 

linked 

there  are  some  chromosomal  regions  highly  linked  to 
BMD  between  these  two  locations.  Pedigree  specific 
LOD  revealed  that  pedigree  1  had  the  highest  con-
tribution  to  the  overall  LOD  for  D13S175  in  BMD-LA  and 
BMD-LW.  Other  families,  pedigree  18,  21  and  139  also 
had  high  contributions.  The  mean  BMD  values  for  LA 
and  LW  in  these  families  were  slightly  higher  than  the 
remaining  families  but  the  difference  was  not  significant 
in  paired  t-test.  The  assumed  reasons  are  that  the  num-
ber  of  these  selected  families  was  not  big  enough  and 
that  the  BMD  values  were  not  corrected  by  variables 
such  as  sex  and  age.  Therefore,  a  more  sophisticated 
study  design  in  subfamily  analyses  is  needed  to  help 
understand  the  extent  of  genetic  effects  on  BMD. 
    In  addition  to  two-point  linkage  analysis,  multipoint 
linkage  analysis  was  performed.  The  strongest  linkage 
signal  was  on  13p11  (LOD=1.7549)  for  right  wrist.  This 
region  has  not  been  previously  reported  to  have  associ-
ations  with  BMD;  nevertheless  there  is  a  candidate  gene 
at  13p11  for  interleukin  17D.  Interleukin  17  is  known  to 
affect  osteoclastic  resorption  and  mediate  bone  destruc-
tion,  suggesting  that  it  may  be  associated  with  BMD 
(Van  Bezooijen  et al.,  1999).
    The  second  strongest  linkage  in  our  study  was  on 
13q21.33  at  69cM  for  right  wrist  (LOD=1.4462)  which 
was  also  shown  in  left  wrist  with  the  LOD  score  of 
0.4610  (Fig.  2).  Chromosome  13q21  has  been  reported 
in  other  previous  studies.  Kammerer et al.  (Kammerer et 
al.,  2003)  found  a  suggestive  linkage  on  13q14-13q22  in 
male  Mexican  Americans  (LOD=3.46  of  the  trochanter 
and  LOD=2.51  of  the  hip  neck)  which  was  close  to  our 
QTL  region.  There  was  another  report  of  strong  linkage 
(Hsu et al.,  2007),  which  showed  highest  LOD  score  of 
3.62  for  BMD  of  lumbar  spine  on  chromosome  13q21. 
However,  this  was  performed  as  a  sex-specific  linkage 
analysis  which  only  considered  women.  Although  no  ob-
vious  candidate  genes  are  present  in  this  region,  there 
is  another  strong  evidence  for  a  QTL  (LOD=16.3)  that 
affects  femur  BMD  in  femal  mice  (Beamer et al.,  2001). 
This  linkage  was  shown  in  a  region  homologous  to  hu-
man  chromosome  13q14-21,  which  strongly  suggests 
that  these  may  be  a  relevant  QTL.  Deng et al.  (Deng et 
al.,  2002)  also  reported  suggestive  evidence  (LOD=2.43) 
for  a  QTL  for  spine  BMD  on  13q33-13q34,  but  this  may 
represent  a  different  QTL.
    There  were  another  suggestive  QTLs  for  left  ankle 
and  wrist  which  showed  linkages  with  LOD=0.8229  and 
0.7611  each  on  13p13  at  0  cM.  This  corresponds  with 
the  results  of  the  two-point  analysis  though  the  score 
was  less  significant  in  the  multipoint  linkage.  Also,  high-
est  LOD  score  of  right  ankle  was  shown  at  the  same  re-
gion  13p13  at  0  cM  (LOD=0.4103).  To  our  knowledge, 
no  previous  linkage  has  been  reported  for  BMD  pheno-

types  in  this  region. 
    In  summary,  we  identified  three  suggestive  QTLs  at 
chromosome  13p11,  13q21.33  and  13p13  in  the  Mongo-
lian  population.  13q21.33  has  been  reported  in  previous 
studies,  suggesting  that  there  may  be  a  relavant  QTL  in 
this  region.  The  different  findings  between  our  study  in 
Mongolian  population  and  previous  studies  imply  that 
genetic  variation  underlying  BMD  may  depend  on  eth-
nicity  or  geographic  location,  though  we  should  always 
consider  that  the  differences  in  study  design  exist. 
Further  studies  such  as  fine  mapping  through  linkage 
disequilibrium  or  positional  candidate  gene  analysis  will 
be  required  to  definitively  identify  genes  and  their  func-
tional  consequences  that  contribute  to  BMD.
