Introduction 
The detection and the regulation of synthetic chemicals 
and the establishment of toxicity that may pose a genetic 
hazard in our environment are subjects of great concern 
because of its close correlation  between environmental 
contamination  and  human  health.  Since  the  tens  of 
thousands  of  man-made  chemicals  that  have  been 
introduced into the environment in the last few decades 
must also  be tested  for their damaging  effect on  DNA, 
the agents that cause this damage must be identified. 

Toxicology  has  been  defined  as  the  qualitative and 
quantitative study of the adverse effects of xenobiotics 
on living organisms. Moreover, modern toxicology goes 
beyond  the  study of the  adverse  effects  of exogenous 
agents to the  study of cellular and  molecular effects of 
toxicants using  molecular biological tools.  Toxicology is 
a  multidisciplinary field,  and  an  important  science that 
impacts  both  environmental  health  regulation  and  the 
development and practice of medicine (Klaassen, 2001 ). 
Classical toxicological tools require hundreds of animals 
and provide little information with respect to mechanism(s). 
For  example,  descriptive  studies  in  genetically  inbred 
animals do not explain genetic and biological differences 
in 
individual 
response to drugs and environmental xenobiotics. 

the  human  population  that  influence 

Recently,  several  new methods for the  detection  of 
genetic  damages  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  were  introduced 
according to the rapid  progress  in  toxicology combined 
with cellular and molecular biology (Ryu,  1999c, 2002a,b).

Among these methods, the single cell gel electrophoresis 
(comet assay) which can be detected DNA damages in 
cell  level  (Mckelvey-Martin  et  a/.,  1993;  Singh  et  a/., 
1988,  1991,  1994;  Ryu  et at.,  1997;  Tice  et at.,  2000), 
mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase gene assay (Clive et 
a/.,  1983;  Ryu  eta/.,  1999b), FISH (fluorescence in  situ 
hybridization) (Hayashi  eta/.,  1994),  PRINS  (primed  in 
situ  hybridization)  (Abba  et  at.,  1993)  and  transgenic 
animal  and  cell  line model  as a parameter of lac I (Big 
Blue)  (Kohler eta/.,  1991;  Ryu  et at.,  1998a,b,  1999a, 
2000, 2001c) or lac Z (Muta Mouse) (Suzuki et at., 1993) 
gene  mutation  are  newly  introduced  based  on  cellular 
and  molecular  toxicological  approaches.  Also,  in  vivo 
supravital micronucleus assay with peripheral reticulocytes 
by using acridine orange fluorescent staining (Hayashi et 
at.,  1990;  Ryu  et at.,  2001b) was introduced  instead  of 
mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. Moreover, the 
rapid  progress  in  cellular  and  molecular  biology,  like 
many other branches of biomedical research, toxicology 
is now experiencing a renaissance fueled by the application 
of "omic" technologies to gain a better understanding of 
the  biological  basis  of toxicology  of drugs  and  other 
environmental  factors  (Aederma  and  McGregor,  2002; 
Hamadeh and Afsari,  2004). 

In this review on current toxicology,  at first,  the rapid 
progress  of  cellular  and  molecular  toxicological  tools, 
and  then  concept,  approaches  and  applications  of 
toxicogenomics will be described. 

Cellular and Molecular Toxicology 
Since  the  remarkable  progress  in  cell  biology  and 
biochemistry, the use of cell lines, enzymes, construction 
of  genes  etc  became  more  easier  to  handle  in  the 
laboratories.  In  this respect,  classical toxicology moved 
to cellular and  molecular toxicology at present,  and  will 
move to toxicogenomics (Newton eta/., 2004) in the near 
future.  For  example,  genetic  toxicology  has  great 
changes  in  methodology and  sensitivity.  Generally,  the 
carcinogenicity  including  genotoxicity  is  one  of  the 
potential toxicity that may consider for the human health. 
It has been widely assumed that mutation represents at 
least  one  step 
in  carcinogenesis.  The  evidence 
supporting this idea is that the majority of mutagens are 
carcinogens (McCann et at.,  1975) and, for at least some 
compounds,  mutagenic  potency  is  closely  correlated 

154  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 2(4) 153-162, December 2004 

to 

found 

with carcinogenic potency (Meselson and Russel, 1977). 
Moreover, rrutagens and certain non-mutagenic carcinogens 
have  also  been 
induce  chromosomal 
rearrangement  (Zimmermann,  1971) which  may  affect 
carcinogenesis by altering gene expression, perhaps by 
allowing the activation  or inactivation  of cellular cancer 
genes (Radman eta/., 1982). Several classical genotoxicity 
assay  systems  with  rapidity  and  reliability  have  been 
introduced  and  practically  applied  (Ames  et at.,  1973; 
Maron  and  Ames,  1983;  Mersch-Sundermann  et  at., 
1991) for predicting the carcinogenicity of chemicals and 
also  been  introduced  to  the  evaluation  of genotoxicity 
{lshidate  and  Odashima,  1977;  Radman  et at.,  1982; 
Hayashi  et at.,  1990,  1994;  Ryu  et at.,  1993a,b,  1997, 
1999b) and of antimutagenicity (Sato et at.,  1991; Ryu et 
a/.,  1993b, 2001b).  Cytogenetic studies on  mammalian 
cells in vivo (Schmid,  1975;  Hayashi et at.,  1990,  1994) 
as well  as in  vitro  {lshidate and  Odashima,  1977) have 
also  been  widely  used  as  a  screening  method  for 
DNA-attacking substances. 

However,  these  kinds  of  toxicity  evaluation  tools 
cannot elucidate the mode and/or mechanism of actions 
of  chemicals,  especially  carcinogens  and  mutagens. 
Moreover, many scientists try to develope more precise, 
convenient and sensitive techniques for the detection of 
DNA damages as  an  index of carcinogenicity.  Several 
new cellular and  molecular genotoxicity assay systems 
are summarized briefly as follows. 

Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet) assay: Since 
Ostling and Johanson ( 1984) introduced nicroelectrophoretic 
technique, Singh et at. ( 1988) have modified and improved 
the microgel electrophoresis technique to evaluate DNA 
damage  in  single  cells  under alkaline  conditions.  The 
comet  assay  is  rapid,  sensitive,  visual  and  simple 
technique  to  quantify  DNA  strand  breaks  in  individual 
cells  at  least  3  major  basic  protocols  (Ostling  and 
Johanson,  1984; Singh eta/.,  1988,  1991,  1994,  1995; 
Olive et at.,  1993, 1994). 

If the agent can  cause the strand  breakage,  we can 
see the extent of tail from the head (nucleus) like comet 
with  staining  of  fluorescent  dyes  such  as  ethidium 
bromide,  acridine orange and  propidium  iodide etc.  To 
harmonize  comet  assay,  International  Workshop  on 
Genotoxicity  Test  Procedure  (IWGTP)  was  held  at 
Washington  D.C.  on  March,  1999  by  Environmental 
Mutagen Society supported with  OECD.  Our laboratory 
(Ryu  et at.,  1997,  2001a,  2002c)  also  involved  in  this 
harmonization  and  recommended  as  OECD  guideline 
with Tice et at. (2000). General reviews on this technique 
have been published by Tice et at.  (2000) and Fairbairn 
et at.  (1995,  1996). 

Mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase (tk)+l- gene assay 

(MOLY):  MOLY with  L5178Y  tk+l- mouse  lymphoma 
cells  described  by  Clements 
(1994),  with  minor 
modification  (Clive  et  at.,  1995,  Garriott  et  at.,  1995; 
Oberly  and  Garriott,  1996;  Ryu  et  at.,  1999b ).  The 
cytotoxicity  of  chemical  was  determined  by  relative 
survival (RS) after 3 hr treatment at concentrations up to 
5,000 ug/ml in the presence and absence of S-9 mixture. 
The  highest  concentration  chosen  was  one  with  a 
1 0-20% RS. Cultures were exposed to the test chemical 
for 3 hr, then cultured for 2 days before plating in 96-well 
microliter plates at 2000 cells/well with trifluorothymidine 
for mutant selection and at 1.6 cells/well for cell viability. 
The number of wells containing colonies was counted on 
day 12 after plating,  and  large and  small  colonies were 
scored.  Mutation  frequencies  were  analyzed  by  the 
statistical  package,  Mutant  V2.31  program  (Hazleton, 
England) in accordance with the UKEMS guidelines. 

Supravital  staining  in  vivo micronucleus  assay with 
peripheral reticulocytes : The micronucleus (MN) assay 
in  vivo  is  a  method  devised  primarily  for  screening 
chemicals  for  chromosome-breaking  effects.  In  the 
monitoring of chromosome breakage, the test is at least 
as  sensitive  as  the  metaphase  method;  in  addition  it 
includes effects on the spindle apparatus. 

This  MN  assay  using  peripheral  blood  erythrocytes 
was  introduced  by  MacGregor  et  at.,  (1980}  and 
developed by Hayashi  et at.  (1990,  1994) having  more 
simple and  convenient compared  to  conventional  bone 
marrow assay by the introduction  of supravital  staining 
with acridine orange (Ryu eta/., 2001b). The conventional 
Giemsa staining method, however, has some disadvantages 
because  not  only  MNs  but  also  some  cell  inclusions 
containing  RNA and  other acidic materials  are stained 
dark blue by Giemsa; it is occasionally difficult to identify 
MNs from these inclusions. Acridine orange metachromatic 
fluorochrome  discriminates  between  DNA and  RNA  by 
green and red fluorescence, respectively. 

In  vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay  : The 
micronucleus  assays  have  emerged  as  one  of  the 
preferred  methods for assessing  chromosome damage 
because  they  enable  both  chromosome  loss  and 
chromosome breakage to be measured reliably (Heddle 
et at.,  1983). Because micronuclei can only be expressed 
in cells that complete nuclear division a special method 
was  developed  that  identifies  such  cells  by  their 
binucleate  appearance  when  blocked  from  performing 
cytokinesis by cytochalasin-B, a microfilament-assembly 
inhibitor. This assay allows better precision because the 
data obtained are not confounded by altered cell division 
kinetics  caused  by  cytotoxicity  of  agents  tested  or 
sub-optimal cell culture conditions (Fenech et at.,  1999). 
Transgenic Mutagenesis assay system: The transgenic 

Current Progress of Next Generation Battery of Toxicology- Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, and Toxicogenomics  155 

mutagenesis  system  is  a  useful  and  powerful  tool  to 
evaluate the genotoxicity, and  it also provides a window 
of  carcinogenesis  and  mutagenesis  mechanisms  of 
chemicals  based  on  information  such  as  mutation 
pattern,  frequency,  and  location  in  sequence context of 
the  lac  I  target  gene  (Gorelick,  1995).  The  lac  I 
transgenic Big  Blue Rat2 fibroblast cell  line carries over 
40 copies of lambda shuttle vector (Dycaico eta/., 1994) 
containing lac I gene as a target (Heddle and Tao,  1995; 
Summers eta/.,  1989). The lac I gene,  as  a mutational 
target,  is  very  useful  for  the  study  of  the  mutational 
characteristics of a carcinogen for several reasons. First, 
the relatively small size (1 ,080 bp of coding region) of lac 
I  gene  facilitates  sequence  analysis.  Second, 
the 
expression  of 
rapid 
colorimetric assay to screen for mutations. The mutations 
induced  in  the  lac  I  gene  can  easily  be  quantified  by 
mutant frequency  (MF),  and  the  precise  mutation  type 
and  distribution  can  quickly  be  identified  by  direct 
sequencing. Moreover, considering that mutations in lac 
I  gene  induced  by  chemicals  reflect  the  effects  of 
mutagens  on  other  endogenous  genes  such  as  proto(cid:173)
oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor  genes,  and  that 
mutations occurred in these genes are the most common 
events  in  many  types  of  human  cancer  (Kohler  et at., 
1991;  Gossen  eta/.,  1989),  this  assay  may  provide  a 
powerful tool to predict the mutation spectrum induced in 
cancer-related  genes  more  accurately  (Ryu  et  a/., 
1998a,b, 1999a, 2000).

Toxicogenomics 
The recent completion of the human genome sequencing 
project and  the push  to finish  the mouse genome have 
raised the stakes in science with predictions of disease 
cures,  more effective and  safer pharmaceuticals,  and  a 
greater  understanding  of  environmental  effects  on 
human health. The impact of human genome projects on 
toxicological  research  is  high,  heralding  the  emerging 
technologies  of 
toxicogenomics,  proteomics,  and 
bioinformatics (Lovett, 2000; Pollack, 2000) for the future 
use  of  these  technologies  and  their  impact  on  drug 
discovery,  safety evaluation,  elucidation  of pathways of 
toxicity, and risk assessment. The basis of toxicogenomics 
is  summarized  in  Fig.  1.  The  NIEHS  established  the 
National Center for Toxicogenomics(NCT) in September 
2000.  According  to  the  center's  mission  statement,  its 
goal  is  "to  use  the  methodologies  and  information  of 
genomics science to significantly improve our understanding 
of  basic  biological  responses  to  environmental  stressors/ 
toxicants." Paul Gilman, who is an assistant administrator 
for  EPA,  states  that toxicogenomics  is  a  powerful  tool 

Fig.  1. The basis of Toxicogenomics 

with great promise for risk assessment (Bergeson et a/., 
2002). And also,  he stressed that EPA encourages and 
supports  continued  genomics  research  as  a  powerful 
tool for understanding the molecular basis of toxicity and 
developing  biomarkers  of  exposure,  effects,  and 
susceptibility.  He  also  mentioned 
that  genomics 
information is useful in a weight-of-the-evidence approach 
for  human  health  and  ecological  risk  assessments  on  a 
case-by-case basis at this time. By combining these new 
"omics"  approaches  with  classical  and/or  conventional 
toxicological  methods,  it  is  possible  to  develope  the 
experimental  models  and  strategies to  evaluate  1) the 
diverse structure and properties of various chemicals; 2) 
the relationship between the time of exposure, dose, and 
health  outcomes;  3)  the  influence  of  genetics  and 
behavioral 
interaction  between  mutiple 
components  of  biological  systems  in  development  of 
toxic responses;  5)  intrinsic biological health  responses 
with extremely low concentration for long time exposure, 
and 6) toxicological responses of compounds at an early 
stage  of  the  drug  discovery  process  and  health  risk 
assessment. 

factors;  4) 

What  is  Toxicogenomics?  :  Toxicogenomics,  in  a 
broader sense, is defined as a study of the response of a 
genome to hazardous substances, using: i) Genomic-scale 
mRNA expression  (transcriptomics),  ii)  Cell  and  tissue 
wide protein expression (proteomics), and iii) Metabolite 
profiling (metabon/lomics) in combination with bioinforrnatic 
methods  and  conventional  toxicology  (In  a  narrow 
sense, it refers to the use of transcriptomics).  In relation 
to  chemical  hazard/risk  assessment,  this  emerging 
science could provide tools for improving the understanding 
of mechanism of toxicity,  identification of biomarkers for 
prediction  of  toxicity  and  exposure,  and  possibly 
alternative methods for chemical screening,  hazard and 
toxicity identification, characterization, and classification. 

156  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 2(4) 153-162,  December 2004 

Approaches and Application ofToxicogenomics: The 
utilization  of these  new  technologies  along  with  more 
established  genetic  approaches  such  as  quantitative 
real time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), and the 
use of genetically altered animals will dramatically move 
the  field  of toxicology  forward.  As  you  know  well,  the 
recent  remarkable  advances  in  genomics,  proteomics, 
and  metabon/lomics,  the  interactions between  multiple 
genes,  proteins, and pathways can now be investigated 
with more easy and time-saving ways (Irwin et at., 2004). 
eDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays and high-throughput 
2-D electrophoresis systems  have quickly emerged  as 
the  premier  tools  to  enable  genomewide  analysis  of 
gene  expression  at  the  RNA  and  protein  level.  These 
new technologies are heavily influencing drug discovery 
and preclinical safety in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
industry (Freeman,  2000,  2004).  Toxicologists are also 
promoting  genomic  expression 
technologies  as  a 
superior  alternative  to Jraditional  rodent  bioassays  to 
identify  and  assess  the  safety  of chemicals  and  drug 
candidates  for  human  safety  (Afshari  et  a/.,  1999; 
Nuwaysir eta/.,  1999;  Pennie eta/., 2000,  2002;  Ryu  et 
a/.,  2002d).  It is expected that gene expression profiling 
will  identify  mechanisms  of  action  that  underlie  the 
potential  toxicity  of  chemicals  and  drug  candidates. 
Ultimately, toxicogenomics (the integration of genomics, 
bioinformatics, and toxicology) is expected to accelerate 
drug development (Suter, 2004; Yang eta/., 2004), and 
aid  environment  ecological  (Neumann  and  Galvez, 
2002) and health risk assessment. 

In  the  laboratory,  these  are  some  examples  of 
questions  that  researchers  will  be  able  to  address  by 
toxicogenomics as follows;  Which  genes are regulated 
upwards or downwards (apoptosis, cellular proliferation, 
metabolism,  communication  and  cell  adhesion,  etc.) 
following  an  exposure  to  mercury,  PCBs  or  triazines 
pesticides?  Is  the  response  similar  in  the  liver,  lung, 
testes,  ovaries and  brain? Are the responses of animal 
and cell models comparable to humans? The network is 
also particularly interested in the genetic factors responsible 
for environmental  contaminant-induced  breast cancers, 
unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, and children's health. 
The  approaches  in  the  commercial  basis,  one  of 
examples,  TNO  pharma  (2004)  has  taken  up  the 
challenge  of  toxicogenomics.  A  research  program  is 
initiated with the following features; 

Embedding  in  "classical"  toxicology:  comparison  of 
multiple  gene  expression  and  proteome  changes 
induced in vivo as a function of time and dose level. 

Use of in vitro systems to underscore in vivo findings 

(but not the other way around!). 

Integrated  genomics  and  proteomics  analysis  of 

target organs. 

Incorporation  of  kinetics  and  metabolism  in  target 

organ toxicity assessment. 

Evaluation of possible polymorphisrns in the mechanism 
of toxicity, and the consequences for extrapolation to the 
human situation. 

Combination  of  tissue  microdissection  and  gene 
expression  analysis  in  order  to  relate  pathology  and 
genomics. Comparison of gene expression changes to a 
toxicogenomics database to allow for classification of the 
effects. 

A proprietary pathway related  bioinformatics system 

aiding the toxicologist in understanding the data. 

Complex data analysis based  on  pattern  recognition 

and proprietary principle component analysis. 

First  grade  technology  ("home-made"  high  density 
DNA  arrays,  2D-proteomics  with  MALDI-TOF  and 
nanospray MS). 

Advantages and !irritations: There are both advantages 
and  limitations  to  the  use  of  gene  microarray  and 
proteomics technologies in toxicological screening.  The 
main  advantage is  a global  approach to  understanding 
the  complex mechanisms  involved  in  toxicology.  Gene 
microarrays have been  costly and  limited  in  availability, 
but  the  past  year  has  shown  a  commitment  by  the 
scientific community to the general use and availability of 
gene microarrays. Consequently, cost has been reduced 
by  increased  supply  and  demand.  Furthermore,  the 
availability and cost is substantially improving with many 
universities and  research centers establishing genomic 
and proteomic facilities. Also recent experiments applied 
to  cancer genetics  have  demonstrated  the  potential  of 
gene expression profiling to accurately classify disease 
phenotypes (Aiizadeh eta/., 2000;  Bittner eta/., 2000), 
thus lending hope that expression profiling may classify 
and  thus  predict  phenotypes  of toxicity.  Despite  these 
expectations,  it  is  still  uncertain  how gene  expression 
profiling  experiments  will  ultimately  contribute  to  our 
understanding of toxicity and allow us to  realize the full 
potential  of this  new  technology.  Pennie  et a/.  (2000, 
2002,  2004)  have  also  discussed  the  possibilities  and 
caveats  of gene  expression  profiling  in  the  context  of 
toxicology  and  have 
mechanistic  and  predictive 
addressed the certainty, biological relevance. Therefore, 
toxicogenomics  and  proteomics  will  certainly  become 
generally used technologies in the near future. 

HeaiUl RiskAssessmentand Biomarkers: Biomarkers 
will play an important role in early detection of environmentally 
induced disease, since routine surveillance programs in 
both  human  and  animals in  suspected  environmentally 
hazardous  areas  could  be  instituted.  Toxicogenomics 
and  proteomics  are  also  providing  new biomarkers for

use in human studies. It is now possible to envision schemes 
for  integrating  the  results  of  molecular  epidemiological 
investigations into the general toxicological evaluations of 
environmental  agents.  These  will  allow  intermediate 
endpoints to be used for making  realistic human health 
assessments and for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms 
that  identify  targets  for  intervention,  all  with  the  goal  of 
preventing  environmentally  mediated  human  disease. 
Also,  select  biomarker  responses  that  predict  the 
likelihood  of disease  occurrence will  find  application  in 
the interpretation of individual medical diagnostic tests, 
with 
the  goal  of  improving  cancer  detection  and 
management. The objective is to determine whether gene, 
protein or metabolite expression profiles or "signatures" 
can serve as markers to  predict toxicity. Current efforts 
are underway to establish "best choices and  practices" 
and  perform  proof-of  principle  experiments 
to 
phenotypically anchor altered  patterns of expression to 
conventional  parameters  of  toxicity.  These  trials  are 
more closely define the  time  and  dose relationships  to 
express  "signatures"  that  develope  tools  of  predictive 
toxicology and  elucidate common  mechanism of toxicity 
and drug action.  Early detection of toxic exposures is a 
developing art, but many groups have already successfully 
classified  chemical  exposures  based  on  profiling  of 
treated  animals  (Bartosiewicz  et  a/., 
mRNA  from 
2001a,b;  Hamadeh  et  a/.,  2002a,b,c).  This  kind  of 
information  might be useful for risk assessment  in  that 
significant changes in expression in a small set of highly 
discriminatory genes can together act as a biomarker of 
toxic mechanisms or endpoints. 

Toxicoinfonnatics  :  There  is  more  specified  fields 
such as toxicoinformatics. Toxicoinformatics is the important 
factor oftoxicogenomics field. Toxicoinformatics is essential 
computational  tools for the analysis of time- and dose(cid:173)
dependent changes in patterns of toxicant-induced gene 
expression.  Development  of  these  capabilities  will 
require a database that complies high quality data from 
diverse  sources  involving  different  gene  expression 
platforms, assay methods, validation results and diverse 
drugs,  chemicals  or  environmental  agents.  Complete 
analysis will require linkage between and among additional 
databases that  provide  most current sequence  identity 
can  annotate  gene  identify  and  function,  chemical 
structure, toxicity, pathology, pharmacokineticslbiodistribution, 
and  genotoxicity  (Mattes  eta/.,  2004;  Mattingly  eta/., 
2004; Olden eta/., 2004; Tong eta/., 2004). 

International Hannonization and QA/QC : To promote 
the  further  development  and  application  of the  "omic" 
technologies to toxicology and environmental health risk 
assessment,  recently,  on  Oct  12-13,  Toxicogenomics 
International  Forum  (2004)  was  held,  and  continuosly, 
OECD/IPCS organized a speciaiiNOfkshop fortoxicogenomics 
focusing  eco-toxicogenomics  at  Kyoto,  Japan  on  Oct 
13-15,  2004.  In  this  OECD/IPCS  workshop  (2004),  4 
group sessions open to discuss the problems and future 
plan  of  toxicogenomics,  especially  focused  on  eco(cid:173)
toxicogenomics (Fig. 2). 

One is biological breakout group and they summarized 
that toxicogenomic technologies have unique opportunities 
to address ecological and human health concerns, such 
as;  i) offering  possibilities to reduce,  refine and  replace 

158  Genomics & Informatics  Vol.  2(4) 153-162, December 2004 

costly animal intensive methods for chemical screening 
and testing, ii) understanding how and why species and 
subgroups differ in  sensitivity and response to chemical 
stress, and create a stronger scientific foundation for the 
safety  factors.  This  will  allow  effective  policies  to  be 
developed in order to protect endangered and importance 
species,  iii) assessing  the  effects of chemical  mixtures 
and  combination  of stressors.  Previously,  appropriate 
methods  have  been  lacking.  iv)  reduced  uncertainty in 
assessment  of ecological  conditions.  These  will  allow 
effective policies to be developed to protect endangered 
and important species. For these reasons, it is important 
that these new tools are evaluated and implemented for 
chemical risk assessment. 

In  the technical  group,  several  useful technical tools 
such as global oligo array,  global eDNA array,  targeted 
oligo array, targeted eDNA array, Q-PCR and SAGE for 
transaiptorrics, and 20-rvw...DI, 20-I'VlS'MS, Ophergen-rvw.JJI, 
Protein  arrays,  LC-MS/MS,  ICAT-MALDI,  ICAT-MS/MS 
and ELISA for proteomics, and NMR, targeted MS-based, 
LC-electrochemical for metabolomics were discussed. 

The  regulatory usefulness of toxicogenomic tools  is 
very important (Frueh eta/., 2004).  In this respect, in the 
regulatory group, expected outcomes are a road map for 
development, validation and regulatory use of genomic(cid:173)
based tools, proposals for further activities related to the 
use of genomic-based methods in chemical assessment 
and  promotion  of  related  research  to  be  undertaken 
within  the  OECD  Environment,  Health  and  Safety 
Programme, and proposals for mechanism of international 
co-ordination 
the  development,  validation  and 
regulatory use of genome-based tools. 

for 

The bioinfonratics group adopted general recomrendations 
such as 1) stable funding and adequate funding must be 
provided  to  a  national  and 
internationals  level  for 
standardization initiatives, database and tool development 
and  long-term maintenance,  2)  provide training  in  data 
requirements  and  bioinformatics  issues  relating 
to 
ecotoxicogenomics for risk  assessors,  3)  governments 
should  promote  synergy  between  the  toxicology  and 
ecotoxicology communities, including a trialogue between 
regulators  and  bioinformaticians  on  an 
scientists, 
the  broader  context  of 
international  scale,  4) 
in 
ecotoxicogenomics  studies, 
initial  efforts  should  be 
centered on a few species representative of the ecological 
complexity,  and 5) establish a task force/working group 
to  implement  these  recommendations  and  coordinate 
future actions. 

The  ultimate  promise  of toxicogenomics  lies  in  its 
potential  ability;  (i) to  identify sources  of interindividual 
variability  in  response  to  drugs  and  environmental 
xenobiotics,  both  in  terms of efficacy and  toxicity;  This 

area of research requires genetics knowledge regarding 
individual variation which determines person's responses 
to drugs and  xenobiotics;  (ii) to  provide a database for 
the  development  of  high-throughput  and 
low-cost 
platforms for screening substances for toxicity; and (iii) to 
improve the process of discovering new targets for drug 
the  high  degree  of  QA/QC  on 
action.  However, 
microarray chips  to  produce  more  reliable  data will  be 
remained to be solve at present. 

factors  and  also 

individual's  genetic  information 

As every human being on the earth are unique in their 
genetic make up, there are huge variations in responses 
in 
against  outer  environmental 
susceptibility to  a  disease.  As  the  medical  research  is 
getting  into  the  arena  of personalized  medicine  which 
applies 
in  disease 
treatment and selection of drugs, toxicogenomic research 
also have to look into the individual genetic differences. 
A  genetic variation  which  is  involved  in  metabolism  of 
toxicants  and  chemicals  can  answer  the  questions  of 
why  some  people  react  more  sensitively  to  same 
than  others.  Careful  cataloging  of 
environments 
association between genetic background and responses 
to  toxic  substances  will  serve  as  a  powerful  tool  to 
understand  toxicological  phenomenon.  This  way,  one 
can  possibly  assess  each  individual's  risks  in  a  given 
environment and design a plan to avoid any toxic effects. 
Consequently, toxicogenomics will be a great promising 
next generation technology (Waring and  Halbert, 2002) 
in the fields of health risk assessment, drug safety, food 
safety and forensic toxicology etc. 

Additionally, there will a new paradigm that is systems 
biology. The confluence of omics, bioinformatics, mechanistic 
studies at the molecular level, and computational biology 
has  yielded  a  new  discipline  called  systems  biology 
(Oitvai and Barabasi, 2002). " Systems biology is a new 
field  of  biology  that  aims  to  develop  a  system-level 
understanding  of  biological  systems(Kitano,  2002).  It 
requires collective efforts from  multiple research  areas, 
such  as  molecular  biology  (genomics),  high-precision 
measurement,  computer  science,  control  theory  and 
other scientific and engineering fields.
