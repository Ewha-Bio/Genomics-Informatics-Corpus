Studies of cancer heterogeneity have received considerable attention recently, because the presence or absence of resistant 
sub-clones may determine whether or not certain therapeutic treatments are effective. Previously, we have reported G64, a 
co-regulated gene module composed of 64 different genes, can differentiate tumor intra- or inter-subpopulations in lung 
adenocarcinomas  (LADCs).  Here,  we  investigated  whether  the  G64  module  genes  were  also  expressed  distinctively  in 
different subpopulations of other cancers. RNA sequencing-based transcriptome data derived from 22 cancers, except LADC, 
were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Interestingly, the 22 cancers also expressed the G64 genes in a 
correlated manner, as observed previously in an LADC study. Considering that gene expression levels were continuous among 
different tumor samples, tumor subpopulations were investigated using extreme expressional ranges of G64—i.e., tumor 
subpopulation with the lowest 15% of G64 expression, tumor subpopulation with the highest 15% of G64 expression, and 
tumor subpopulation with intermediate expression. In each of the 22 cancers, we examined whether patient survival was 
different among the three different subgroups and found that G64 could differentiate tumor subpopulations in six other 
cancers, including sarcoma, kidney, brain, liver, and esophageal cancers.

Introduction

Different  tumors  or  cancers  in  different  patients  have 
distinct  genetic  and  cellular  profiles,  including  kinds  of 
genetic mutations, patterns of gene expression, and meta-
static potential, which is often called cancer heterogeneity. 
The heterogeneity occurs both within and between tumors 
and  leads  to  intra-tumor  heterogeneity  and  inter-tumor 
heterogeneity,  respectively  [1-3].  Understanding  cancer 
heterogeneity  has  recently  been  one  of  the  important 
research  subjects,  because  it  is  the  base  of  difficulty  in 
developing effective cancer treatments. 

Tumor  heterogeneity  is  basically  due  to  the  different 
origins of tumor cells or tissues. Various biological factors, 
such  as  smoking,  gender,  age,  or  hormonal  status,  can 
influence  cancer  initiation  or  progression,  as  well.  Fund-
amentally, there are genetic variations among the hosts, even 
for the same cancer [4-6]. Astonishingly rapid development 

of massively parallel sequencing, alternatively called next- 
generation sequencing technologies, has recently elucidated 
the  extent  of  tumor  heterogeneity,  and  several  hundred 
somatic mutations and structural variants that drive cancers 
have been identified [7-9].

Previously,  we  reported  the  characterization  of  the 
heterogeneity  of  human  lung  adenocarcinomas  (LADCs) 
from  patient-derived  xenografts  via  single-cell  transcri-
ptome sequencing [10]. These cells were categorized into 
two separate subpopulations based on their expression of a 
module  gene  named  G64.  We  found  that  G64  up- 
regulation/down-regulation  was  also  present  in  patient 
tissue  samples  obtained  from  the  Cancer  Genome  Atlas 
(TCGA),  with  G64  up-regulation  corresponding  to  poor 
survival and associated with multiple clinical variables, such 
as smoking status (which exhibited the highest correlation) 
and tumor stage. 

In  the  present  study,  we  investigated  if  G64  can  diffe-

rentiate tumor subpopulations in other cancers, as well.

Methods
Websites for downloading RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
data for 22 cancer datasets

The  TCGA  website  (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/ 
tcgaHome2.jsp) was used for downloading RNA-seq-based 
transcriptome data and patient survival information for 22 
cancers. The RNA-seq data downloaded for each cancer are 
listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. As described in 
the  previous  report  [10],  expression  values  of  0＜FPKM 
(fragments  per  kilobase  of  exon  per  million  fragments 
mapped)＜0.1 were all converted to 0.1 to avoid the infinity 
problem. Each FPKM value of each gene was divided by the 
average FPKM estimated for the total patient samples where 
the gene is expressed and was log2-transformed, for which 
heat map analysis combined with hierarchical clustering was 
performed with the ‘hclust’ function of R package (https:// 
stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/hclus
t.html).

Statistical tests

We used R (v 3.1.3) for all statistical tests (https://cran. 
r-project.org/).  Using  the  factoMineR  (http://factominer. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

free.fr) and rgl (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgl/) 
packages, principal component analysis (PCA) and visuali-
zation  were  performed  [11].  The  survival  packages  were 
used (http://r-forge.r-project.org) to compare patient survival 
rates and draw Kaplan-Meier plots. The coxph function in 
the  survival  packages  was  used  for  performing  the  Cox 
regression analysis [12, 13]. 

Results
Selection of two extreme patient groups and one 
intermediate group determined by G64 expression

The  G64  genes  were  originally  identified  by  their  co- 
regulated expression pattern in single cells derived from a 
single  LADC  tumor  region  [10].  Interestingly,  we  have 
reported that 488 LADC patients samples downloaded from 
the TCGA were also separated into two distinct groups by 
the G64 genes. In the present work, we examined whether 
G64 could be a classifier for other cancers, as well. For this 
analysis, 22 RNA-seq-based transcriptome data with a sam-
ple size ≥150 were retrieved from the TCGA. The threshold 
of 150 was selected, because it was considered to be the 
minimum number of samples for statistical tests between

different groups (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).

As  done  in  the  previous  LADC  study  [10],  heat  map 
analysis  was  performed  for  each  cancer  type  to  see  how 
patient samples were separated by G64 (Supplementary Fig. 
1).  As  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  1,  the  co-regulated 
patterns of G64 expression were confirmed in all types of 
cancers we tested. However, distinct two-group separations 
were not as evident as the case for LADC. Therefore, we 
classifies patient samples further into three different cate-
gories by using a 15% extreme threshold of G64 expression 
(Supplementary Fig. 2): the highest 15% group, the lowest 
15% group, and an intermediate group. For this purpose, the 
patients  were  sorted  out  by  the  intensity  of  the  average 
FPKM values of the G64 genes expressed in each patient. As 
a result, for instance, among a total of 531 kidney renal clear 
cell carcinoma (KIRC) samples, 160 samples were assigned 
into  the  two  extreme  groups—the  highest  15%  and  the 
lowest  15%—whereas  the  remaining  371  samples  were 
classified into the intermediate group. 

G64 up-regulating cancers tend to have a poor 
prognosis in six different cancers

We next investigated whether patient survival was signi-
ficantly  different  in  these  three  groups  classified  by  the 
average intensity of G64 expression. Patient survival rates 
were compared among the three patient groups for each of 
the 22 cancers. As done in the LADC study, we performed 
Kaplan-Meier  analysis  using  the  patients’  survival  data 
obtained from the TCGA in each type of cancer. Survival 
rates were compared between the lowest 15% versus highest 
15% groups (i.e., P1 comparison in Table 1), the lowest 15% 
versus intermediate groups (i.e., P2 comparison in Table 1), 
and the intermediate versus highest 15% groups (i.e., P3 
comparison in Table 1). PCA confirmed the groups’ sepa-
rations by G64 expression (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 3–7). 
As summarized in Table 1, only six cancers were shown to 
have  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups, 
including  KIRC,  brain  lower  grade  glioma,  liver  hepa-
tocellular carcinoma, kidney renal papilloma cell carcinoma, 
esophageal  carcinoma,  and  sarcoma.  In  all  comparisons

tion  of  the  two  different  groups  was 
significantly  different  (p＜0.001),  as 
shown  in  Table  1.

between groups in these 6 cancers, G64 up-regulation was 
consistently observed to be associated with worse patient 
prognosis  in  the  Cox  regression  analysis  (Fig.  1,  Supple-
mentary Fig. 3–8). 
The 22 cancers were subsequently divided into two batches: 
i.e.,  six  survival-differentiating  cancers  and  16  survival- 
non-differentiating  cancers.  After  the  RNA-seq  samples 
from the 22 cancers were collected as separate batches, we 
examined the aspect of survival difference by G64 expression 
in  each  batch.  Consequently,  the  survival-differentiating 
batch, mixing up six different cancer samples (531 ＋ 514 ＋ 
351 ＋ 289 ＋ 184 ＋ 257 = 2,126 samples), clearly maintained 
the  survival  differentiation  among  the  lowest  15%,  the 
highest 15%, and the intermediate groups (Fig. 2), whereas 
the  survival-non-differentiating  batch,  mixing  up  16 
different cancer samples (178 ＋ 373 ＋ 302 ＋ …. ＋ 179 ＋ 
150 = 5943 samples), showed no survival difference among 
the three different groups determined by G64 expression 
levels (Fig. 2). Taken together, the G64 genes can differe-
ntiate cancer samples by their survival rate differences in 
cancers other than LADC.

Discussion

Basically, it was an interesting finding that genes, named 
the  G64  module  in  our  previous  study  (i.e.,  a  highly  co- 
regulated  gene  group),  can  classify  not  only  single  cells 
derived  from  a  single  tumor  but  also  tumors  that  have 
originated from several different cancers. Various biomar-
kers have been identified and developed for molecular dia-
gnostics in cancers. In fact, numerous genes included in the 
list of the G64 module have already been identified as cancer 
diagnostic  or  prognostic  markers  by  several  independent 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

researchers [14-16]. For instance, CDCA5 and NCAPH have 
been characterized to be highly expressed in lung cancers 
[17, 18]. Our previous study showed that cell cycle genes 
were  a  main  functional  GO  category  in  the  G64  module. 
Consistently, dysregulation of the cell cycle has long been 
proven  to  be  a  critical  process  causing  cancers  [19-22]. 
However, to our knowledge, it was the first finding ever that 
G64 genes were co-regulated in various cancers, and patient 
prognosis  can  be  differentiated  by  these  genes.  Here,  we 
clearly  showed  that  the  G64  module  can  be  a  good  bio-
marker, predicting cancer prognosis at least for six different 
cancers—i.e., seven different cancers if LADC is included. 
It is unclear what common molecular characteristics the 
seven cancers (i.e., 6 cancers in the present study and LADC) 
share together other than co-regulated G64 expression. The 
seven cancers must be initiated and progress by different 
genetic or environmental causes and pathways, and there is 
no  proper  explanation  for  the  common  subpopulation 
differentiation  carried  through  G64  expression.  It  is  also 
hard  to  explain  at  this  moment  why  the  64  genes  are 
co-regulated  on  an  inter-tumoral  level  and  intra-tumoral 
level and why up-regulating patients tend to have a poor 
prognosis. One possibility we can think of is that expression 
of  these  genes  may  be  associated  with  drug  metabolism, 
contributing to drug sensitivity or drug resistance. It will be 
interesting  to  study  further  how  expression  of  G64  is 
changed during the recurrence of cancers. Taken together, 
G64  genes  would  be  a  good  candidate  of  developing 
prognostic markers for multiple cancers.
