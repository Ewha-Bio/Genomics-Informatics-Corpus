Abstract

A  large  number  of  studies  have  been  performed  to  iden-
tify  biomarkers  that  will  allow  efficient  detection  and  de-
termination  of  the  precise  status  of  a  patient’s  disease. 
The  use  of  microarrays  to  assess  biomarker  status  is 
expected  to  improve  prediction  accuracies,  because  a 
whole-genome  approach  is  used.  Despite  their  potential, 
however,  patient  samples  can  differ  with  respect  to  bio-
marker  status  when  analyzed  on  different  platforms, 
making  it  more  difficult  to  make  accurate  predictions, 
because  bias  may  exist  between  any  two  different  ex-
perimental  conditions.  Because  of  this  difficulty  in  ex-
perimental  standardization  of  microarray  data,  it  is  cur-
rently  difficult  to  utilize  microarray-based  gene  sets  in 
the  clinic.  To  address  this  problem,  we  propose  a  meth-
od  that  predicts  disease  status  using  gene  expression 
data  that  are  transformed  by  their  ranks,  a  concept  that 
is  easily  applied  to  two  datasets  that  are  obtained  using 
different  experimental  platforms.  NCI  and  colon  cancer 
datasets,  which  were  assessed  using  both  Affymetrix 
and  cDNA  microarray  platforms,  were  used  for  method 
validation.  Our  results  demonstrate  that  the  proposed 
method  is  able  to  achieve  good  predictive  performance 
for  datasets  that  are  obtained  under  different  ex-
perimental  conditions.

Introduction

To  identify  disease-specific  genes,  numerous  datasets 
have  been  created  under  different  experimental  con-
ditions  at  different  laboratories,  albeit  for  the  same 
purpose.  Many  aspects  of  these  results,  which  have 
been  derived  from  different  datasets,  are  inconsistent,

even  though  the  datasets  were  created  with  the  same 
objective  using  the  same  or  similar  technical  platforms. 
Therefore,  methods  to  integrate  the  results  from  different 
datasets  (Moreau, et al.,  2003;  Rhodes, et al.,  2002)  as 
well  as  methods  to  combine  datasets  prior  to  analysis 
have  been  studied  (Jiang, et al.,  2004;  Kim, et al.,  2007; 
Lee, et al.,  2004).  Such  studies  have  shown  that  reliable 
results  can  be  obtained  by  integrating  results  that  are 
derived  from  different  datasets  and  analyzing  the  com-
bined  datasets,  as  long  as  an  increasing  number  of 
samples  are  utilized.  The  use  of  categorized  values  of 
gene  expression  ratios  may  improve  prediction  accu-
racies  with  respect  to  classification  of  different  ex-
perimental  datasets  (Huan  et al.,  2002).  One  approach 
that  has  been  suggested  is  the  discretization  of  gene 
expression  levels  (George et al.,  2004).  This  method  di-
vides  continuous  gene  expression  levels  into  several 
categories,  and,  as  a  result,  the  bias  that  can  exist  be-
tween  different  microarray  datasets  is  minimized.
    Properly  developed  integration  approaches  should 
help  identify  biomarkers  to  classify  specific  diseases 
based  on  high-throughput  data.  However,  when  a  pa-
tient’s  sample  is  evaluated  to  determine  his/her  dis-
ease  status  using  more  than  one  experimental  condition 
relative  to  a  determined  biomarker  set,  correct  pre-
diction  becomes  impossible.  Furthermore,  methods  to 
predict  the  disease  status  of  a  patient  using  biomarkers 
that  initially  are  identified  under  different  conditions  than 
those  that  are  used  for  the  patient  analysis  have  not 
been  developed.
    This  study  suggests  a  method  that  can  accurately 
predict  the  disease  status  of  a  patient  using  a  pre-
determined  biomarker  that  is  developed  on  a  different 
platform.  Specifically,  we  performed  a  two-step  dis-
cretization  of  gene  expression  values  by  their  rank, 
which  were  processed  in  both  the  biomarker  selection 
and  prediction  stages.

Methods

Datasets

To  evaluate  our  proposed  method,  we  used  two  differ-
ent  datasets:  the  NCI  dataset  (Lee, et al.,  2003)  and  the 
colon  cancer  dataset  (Kim,  et al.,  2007;  Notterman,  et 
al.,  2001).  Both  of  these  datasets  include  gene  ex-
pression  information  that  was  determined  experimentally 
using  two  different  microarray  platforms  (oligonucleo-
tide-based  and  cDNA-based).  There  are  a  large  number

of  cancer  tissue  types  in  the  NCI  dataset;  however,  we 
used  only  the  expression  data  of  ovarian  cancer  and 
colon  cancer  tissues  in  this  study.  The  datasets  that 
were  used  in  this  study  are  summarized  in  Table  1.

Selection  of  significant  gene  sets  from  the  train-
ing  dataset

For  transformation  of  the  dataset,  gene  expression  ra-
tios  were  ranked  in  order  of  expression  ratio  for  each 
gene,  and  the  ranks  were  matched  with  the  correspond-
ing  experimental  group.  This  process  is  similar  to  the 
first  step  of  the  nonparametric  Mann-Whitney  U  test. 
The  steps  that  were  used  to  discretize  gene  expression 
levels  are  summarized  below:
    (1) Gene  expression  ratios  were  ranked  for  every 
gene  in  each  dataset  that  had  more  than  two  ex-
perimental  groups.

Disease  status  prediction  for  a  new  patient  us-
ing  the  selected  discriminative  gene  set

The  test  dataset  was  predicted  using  the  selected  dis-
criminative  gene  set  as  follows:
    (1) Gene  expression  ratios  were  re-ranked  within  each 

experiment  in  the  discriminative  gene  set. 

    (2) A  predictor  was  created  by  using  the  re-ranked 

discriminative  gene  set  in  (1). 

    (3) Gene  expression  ratios  of  the  test  sample  to  be 

predicted  were  ranked. 

    (4) The  prediction  accuracy  of  the  ranked  test  dataset 
was  calculated  using  the  predictor  created  in  step 
(2).

    The  processes  for  significant  gene  selection  and  dis-
ease  prediction  (B  and  C)  were  summarized  in  Fig.  1.

patterns  and  experimental  groups.  The  Kruskal-Wallis

gene  expression  and  the  discretized  dataset,  respec-
tively.  To  evaluate  the  predictive  accuracy  of  the  se-
lected  significant  gene  set,  the  Random  Forest  (RF)  test 
was  used  to  enable  re-sampling  while  still  allowing  for 
repetition  (Breiman,  2001).  We  used  the  RF  program  in 
the  R  package  (http://www.r-project.org)  and  calculated 
OOB  (Out  Of  Bag)  error  and  prediction  accuracy  as 
well.
    We  compared  the  prediction  accuracies  when  real 
gene  expression  values  were  used  and  when  the  ranks 
of  gene  expression  values  were  used.  These  two  ap-
proaches  can  be  summarized  as  follows.
    (1) Method  1:  Gene  expression  values  were  used  for 

gene  selection  and  prediction  stages,  and  OOB 
error  rate  and  prediction  accuracy  were  calculated 
(OOB_raw  data,  Prediction_raw  data).

    (2) Method  2:  During  the  gene  selection  and  prediction 
stages,  the  ranks  of  gene  expression  were  used 
(OOB_rank,  Prediction_rank);  this  is  the  proposed 
method.

Results  and  Discussion

The  OOB  error  rates  and  the  prediction  accuracies  were 
compared  for  the  two  different  approaches-namely,  raw 
data  versus  rank  data.  In  the  NCI  dataset,  the  prediction

accuracy  was  improved  by  using  rank  data  (p=0.052275); 
however,  the  OOB  error  rate  was  significantly  higher 
(p=0.037566)  (Fig.  2). 
    We  next  compared  the  OOB  error  and  prediction  ac-
curacy  for  the  cDNA  and  Oligo  datasets  when  they  were 
used  as  training  and  testing  sets,  respectively.  While  the 
OOB  error  rate  was  not  significantly  different  from  the 
results  in  Fig.  3A  (p=0.277),  the  prediction  accuracy  of 
the  proposed  method  was  significantly  higher  (p=4.57E- 
12)  (Fig.  3B).  In  addition,  the  OOB  error  rate  was  almost 
0  when  the  cDNA  dataset  was  used  as  the  training  da-
taset  (Fig.  3A).  In  contrast,  the  OOB  error  rates  were 
high  for  both  of  the  approaches  when  the  Oligo  dataset 
was  used  for  training  (Fig.  2A).  Nevertheless,  the  pre-

diction  accuracies  did  not  exhibit  dependency  on  the 
OOB  error  rate  (Fig.  2B,  3B).
    In  the  NCI  dataset,  the  fixed  prediction  accuracy  was 
determined  for  the  case  when  gene  expression  levels 
were  used  for  both  gene  selection  and  prediction.  This 
result  indicated  that  all  13  tissues  were  classifiable  into 
either  the  ovarian  or  colon  cancer  groups.  By  scaling 
the  difference  in  gene  expression  between  the  training 
and  testing  datasets,  the  biomarker  that  was  selected 
from  the  training  dataset  was  not  an  accurate  predictor 
of  disease  status  when  it  was  applied  to  the  test 
dataset.  In  contrast,  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  bio-
marker  was  improved  when  the  discretized  dataset  was 
used  for  prediction.  This  result  can  be  interpreted  to

mean  that  the  use  of  ranks  compensated  for  the  influ-
ence  that  different  platforms  had  on  prediction.  Further, 
the  prediction  accuracy  did  not  exhibit  dependency  on 
the  number  of  significant  genes.  For  this  comparison, 
the  significant  genes  were  added  one  by  one  according 
to  their  level  of  significance.  The  fluctuation  in  prediction 
accuracies  can  be  interpreted  to  mean  that  the  added 
genes  shuffled  the  order  of  gene  expression  and  af-
fected  predictability.  Our  results  clearly  showed  that  the 
use  of  data  that  were  discretized  by  rank  was  more  ef-
fective  when  the  cDNA  dataset  was  used  for  training 
(Fig.  3)  rather  than  when  the  Oligo  dataset  was  used 
(Fig.  2).
    For  the  colon  cancer  dataset,  there  was  no  sig-
nificantly  different  OOB  error  rate  between  the  two 
methods  (p=0.33)  (Fig.  4A).  However,  the  prediction  ac-
curacy  was  significantly  higher  when  the  proposed 
method  was  used  (p=0.0118)  (Fig.  4B).
    While  the  OOB  error  rate  for  the  colon  dataset  was 
significantly  different  (p=0.0260)  (Fig.  5A),  the  prediction 
accuracy  was  not  (p=0.611)  (Fig.  5B).  As  shown  in  Fig. 
5A,  the  OOB  error  rate  was  significantly  different  by  ap-
proximately  25  genes,  becoming  very  similar  afterward. 
Therefore,  the  significant  OOB  error  rate  was  likely  due 
to  the  differences  that  were  observed  within  this  range. 
However,  the  non-significance  of  the  prediction  accu-
racy  could  have  been  due  to  the  very  low  prediction  ac-
curacies  of  the  proposed  method  in  this  range  (Fig.  5B). 
    The  OOB  error  rate  was  slightly  lower  when  the  cDNA 
dataset  was  used  as  the  training  dataset;  however,  sim-
ilar  to  what  was  observed  for  the  NCI  dataset,  the  pre-
diction  accuracy  was  not  dependent  on  the  OOB  error 
rate.  When  the  Oligo  dataset  was  used  as  the  training 
dataset  and  more  than  25  to  30  significant  genes  were 
used,  the  proposed  method  exhibited  good  performance 
with  respect  to  prediction  accuracy  (Fig.  4).  However, 
there  was  some  fluctuation  in  prediction  accuracy  when 
the  cDNA  dataset  was  used  as  the  training  dataset. 
Further,  when  the  real  gene  expression  levels  were 
used,  all  tissues  were  classifiable  into  one  of  two 
classes,  normal  and  tumor,  which  also  was  observed  for 
the  NCI  dataset.
    The  use  of  biomarkers  that  are  identified  using  micro-
arrays  can  be  expected  to  improve  the  prediction  accu-
racies  for  a  given  disease  status.  However,  when  a 
sample  from  a  patient  is  analyzed  on  a  different  ex-
perimental  platform  than  that  used  to  analyze  the  bio-
marker,  it  becomes  difficult  to  make  an  accurate  pre-
diction  of  disease  status,  because  bias  can  be  gen-
erated  when  analyzing  two  different  types  of  samples. 
Therefore,  we  developed  a  method  to  correctly  predict 
disease  status  even  when  the  new  sample  is  analyzed 
on  a  different  platform  than  that  originally  used  to  iden-

is 

increased  according 

to 

tify  the  biomarker.
    In  the  NCI  dataset,  we  found  that  it  was  effective  to 
use  the  discretized  value  to  select  significant  genes  and 
make  predictions;  however,  large  variations  in  prediction 
accuracies  were  observed  as  the  number  of  genes 
increased.  This  result  likely  was  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
NCI  dataset  contains  a  small  number  of  samples,  and 
thus  misclassification  of  even  one  sample  may  impact 
the  prediction  accuracy.  The  prediction  accuracy  could 
be  decreased  by  adding  redundant  genes  when  the 
number  of  genes 
their 
significance.
    Though  the  prediction  accuracy  of  the  proposed 
method  was  higher  than  the  previous  method  that  used 
continuous  gene  expression,  it  was  not  affected  by  the 
number  of  significant  genes.  Specifically,  when  the 
cDNA  dataset  was  used  as  the  training  dataset,  the 
OOB  error  rate  was  almost  0  and  the  selected  gene  set 
exhibited  good  predictive  performance.  This  result  in-
dicates  that  the  high  and  stable  prediction  accuracy 
was  due  to  a  reliably  selected  biomarker  (Fig.  3).
    In  the  colon  cancer  dataset,  OOB  error  rates  were 
low  in  both  cases  (Fig.  4A,  5A).  While  the  prediction  ac-
curacy  was  improved  by  the  proposed  method  when 
the  Oligo  dataset  was  used  for  training,  it  was  not  use-
ful  when  the  cDNA  dataset  was  used  for  training.
    For  both  datasets,  the  OOB  error  rates  were  lower 
and  more  stable  when  the  cDNA  dataset  was  used  as 
the  training  dataset  rather  than  the  Oligo  dataset. 
Further,  if  fewer  than  50  significant  genes  were  consid-
ered,  the  proposed  method  exhibited  good  performance 
for  prediction  of  Oligo  data  with  cDNA  data,  and  vice 
versa.
    For  prediction  of  a  new  patient’s  disease  status  using 
biomarkers,  the  patient’s  sample  should  be  analyzed 
using  the  same  platform  that  was  used  to  develop  the 
biomarker 
results. 
However,  this  ideal  situation  is  not  always  possible,  and 
thus  a  reliable  method  to  analyze  data  is  needed  for 
cases  when  the  biomarker  and  patient  sample  have 
been  processed  on  different  platforms.  The  proposed 
method,  which  is  capable  of  handling  such  an  analysis, 
does  so  by  transforming  the  gene  expression  values  of 
a  training  dataset  into  discretized  values  and  then  se-
lecting  discriminative  genes  from  the  resulting  dis-
cretized  dataset. 
    Using  the  process  that  is  outlined  in  this  paper,  the 
disease  status  of  a  patient  can  be  predicted  more  reli-
ably  using  a  biomarker  that  is  developed  on  a  platform 
different  to  what  was  used  to  analyze  the  patient's 
sample.  During  the  prediction  stage,  we  transformed  the 
selected  significant  genes  by  rank.  By  comparing  the 
predictive  accuracy  of  the  number  of  significant  genes, 

to  avoid  bias  and 

inaccurate 

we  expect  that  a  stably  discriminative  gene  set  that  has 
a  high  predictive  capacity  can  be  produced.
