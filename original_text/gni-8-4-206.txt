The  genotype  frequencies  of  rs1800682  were  different 
between  ICH  and  controls  in  the  dominant  model 
(OR=0.49,  95%  CI=0.26-0.94,  p=0.031)  but  not  between 
SAH  and  controls.  In  the  analysis  of  clinical  symptoms, 
however,  rs1800682  was  not  related  to  the  3  clinical 
phenotypes  (NIHSS,  MBI,  and  CRPS).  These  results 

suggest  that  a  promoter  SNP  (rs1800682, −670C/T)  in 

FAS  may  be  associated  with  the  development  of  stroke 
in  the  Korean  population.

Abstract

The  Fas  (TNF  receptor  superfamily,  member  6)  (FAS)/ 
FAS  ligand  (FASLG)  interaction  plays  a  central  role  in 
the  regulation  of  programmed  cell  death.  FAS  and 
FASLG  polymorphisms  in  promoter  regions  affect  tran-
scriptional  activities.  To  investigate  whether  FAS  and 
FASLG  polymorphisms  are  associated  with  the  develop-
ment  and  clinical  phenotypes  of  stroke,  2  promoter  sin-
gle  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  FAS  (rs1800682, 

−670C/T)  and  FASLG  (rs763110,  −844C/T)  were  se-

lected  and  genotyped  by  direct  sequencing  in  220 
stroke  patients  [107  ischemic  stroke  (IS),  77  intra-
cerebral  hemorrhage  (ICH),  and  36  subarachnoid  hemor-
rhage  (SAH)]  and  369  control  subjects.  For  the  analysis 
of  clinical  symptoms,  all  stroke  patients  were  divided  in-
to  3  clinical  phenotypes  according  to  the  respective  re-
sults  of  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  Stroke  Survey 
(NIHSS)  and  the  Modified  Barthel  Index  (MBI)  and  the 
presence  or  absence  of  complex  regional  pain  syn-
drome  (CRPS).  The  SNPStats,  SNPAnalyzer,  and  Helix-
tree  programs  were  used  to  analyze  the  genetic  data. 
Multiple  logistic  regression  models  (codominant,  domi-
nant,  and  recessive)  were  used  to  estimate  odds  ratios 
(ORs),  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  and  p-values.  The 
promoter  SNP  rs1800682  was  associated  with  stroke  in 
the  codominant  (OR=0.48,  95%  CI=0.25-0.94,  p=0.04) 
and  dominant  models  (OR=0.51,  95%  CI=0.30-0.87, 
p=0.011).  However,  a  FASLG  SNP  (rs763110)  was  not  in 
Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p＜0.05).  In  the  analysis  of 
stroke  types,  rs1800682  was  associated  with  IS  in  the 
codominant  (OR=0.30,  95%  CI=0.12-0.74,  p=0.025),  do-
minant  (OR=0.44,  95%  CI=0.23-0.88,  p=0.018),  and  re-
cessive  models  (OR=0.45,  95%  CI=0.21-0.99,  p=0.042).

Introduction

Stroke  is  a  medical  emergency  and  refers  to  the 
long-term  disability.  Stroke  is  generally  classified  into  is-
chemic  stroke  (IS)  and  hemorrhagic  stroke,  including  in-
tracerebral  hemorrhage  (ICH)  and  subarachnoid  hemor-
rhage  (SAH).  With  regard  to  stroke  prevalence,  about 
85%  is  IS,  9%  is  ICH,  and  4%  to  5%  is  due  to  SAH 
(Petrea et al.,  2009).  Environmental  factors,  such  as  hy-
pertension,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  cigarette  smoking, 
contribute  to  the  risk  of  stroke,  and  several  lines  of  evi-
dence  indicate  that  genetic  factors  are  also  involved  in 

the  development  of  stroke  (Gil-Núñez,  2007;  Grysiewicz 

et al.,  2008;  Ikram  et al.,  2009;  Lanktree  et al.,  2010; 
Matarin  et al.,  2007).  Several  candidate  genes  for  the 
susceptibility  to  stroke  have  been  studied.  Interestingly, 
the  promoter  variants  of  these  candidate  genes  are 
thought  to  contribute  to  the  development  of  stroke.  The 
-1082  G/A  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  in  the 
promoter  region  of  interleukin  (IL)  10  was  significantly 
associated  with  IS  in  the  South  Indian  population 
(Munshi et al.,  2010).  The  -607C  allele  of  IL18  was  as-
sociated  with  an  increased  risk  of  IS  in  the  Han  Chinese 
population  (Zhang  et al.,  2010).  Kim  et al.  (2010)  sug-

gested  that  the  −399C/T  neuropeptide  Y  (NPY)  pro-

moter  polymorphism  should  be  considered  a  genetic 
risk  factor  for  IS  in  older  adult  and  female  Koreans. 

Munshi et al.  (2010)  also  suggested  that  the −344T  al-

lele  of  aldosterone  synthase  is  an  important  risk  factor 
for  hypertension  and  IS.  Shi  et al.  (2009)  showed  that 

the −863C/A  SNP  of  tumor  necrosis  factor  (TNF)  is  as-

sociated  with  an  increased  risk  of  idiopathic  childhood 
IS.  Reuter et al.  (2009)  reported  the  association  between 

the  −261G/A  of  TIMP  metallopeptidase  inhibitor  2 

(TIMP2)  and  ICH.
    Fas  (TNF  receptor  superfamily,  member  6)  (FAS)  is  a 
member  of  the  TNF  receptor  family  and  contains  a 
death  domain.  FAS  plays  crucial  roles  in  the  regulation 
of  apoptosis  and  also  activates  nuclear  factor  of  kappa 
light  polypeptide  gene  enhancer  in  B-cells  1  (NFKB1), 
mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  3  (MAPK3,  ERK1),  and 
MAPK8  (JNK)  (Chen  et al.,  2010).  The  FAS/FAS  ligand 
(FASLG)  system 
the 
death-inducing  signaling  complex 
including 
Fas-associated  death  domain  protein  (FADD)  and  cas-
pase  8,  and  has  been  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
various  malignancies  and  neurodegenerative  diseases 
(Hueber,  2000).  Recently,  promoter  SNPs  of  FAS  and 
FASLG  in  various  diseases  were  published.  Zhu  et al. 
(2010)  suggested  that  the  FAS  -670C  allele  could  be 
used  as  a  genetic  risk  marker  for  metastasis  in  naso-
pharyngeal  carcinoma  patients.  Broen  et al.  (2009)  re-

ported  that  the −670C/T  FAS  polymorphism  could  play 

important  regulator  of 

is  an 

(DISC), 

ocardial  infarction.  Liu  et al.  (2009)  demonstrated  that 

a  role  in  the  susceptibility  to  limited  cutaneous  systemic 
sclerosis.  Hanasaki et al.  (2009)  showed  that  a  FAS  pro-

moter  SNP  (−670C/T)  might  be  a  risk  factor  for  my-
the  FASLG  −844C  allele  is  associated  with  a  sig-
ported  that  the  FAS −1377G/A  and  FASLG −844C/T 

nificantly  increased  cancer  risk.  Cao  et al.  (2010)  re-

polymorphisms  are  associated  with  the  risk  of  naso-
pharyngeal  carcinoma.
    In  this  study,  we  investigated  whether  the  promoter 
SNPs  of  FAS  and  FASLG  were  associated  with  stroke 
in  the  Korean  population.  Three  clinical  phenotypes  of 
stroke  patients,  according  to  scores  on  the  National 
Institutes  of  Health  Stroke  Survey  (NIHSS)  and  the 
Modified  Barthel  Index  (MBI)  and  the  presence  or  ab-
sence  of  complex  regional  pain  syndrome  (CRPS),  were 
also  assessed.

Methods

Controls  (n=369,  182  males,  187  females)  were  selected 
from  healthy  participants  who  were  examined  in  a  gen-
eral  health  check-up  program;  none  had  any  clinical  evi-
dence  of  stroke,  ischemic  heart  disease,  or  any  other 
severe  disease.  Stroke  patients  were  selected  among 
participants  who  were  visiting  the  Stroke  Center  of  the 
East-West  Neo-Medical  Center  and  the  emergency  room 
of  Kyung  Hee  Medical  Center  (Seoul,  Korea)  between 
October  2007  and  December  2009.  Two  hundred  twenty 
stroke  patients  (114  males,  106  females)  were  recruited. 
Patients  with  trauma,  hematoma,  brain  tumors,  and  ac-
cidental  or  iatrogenic  stroke  were  excluded.  All  patients 
were  diagnosed  using  cranial  CT,  MRI,  angiography,  or 
duplex  sonography.  The  stroke  group  consisted  of  IS 

FAS  Promoter  SNP  and  Stroke    207

from  all  subjects. 

(n=107),  ICH  (n=77),  and  SAH  (n=36)  (Table  1).  Stroke 
patients  were  divided  into  3  clinical  phenotypes  by 
NIHSS  score,  MBI  score,  and  the  presence  or  absence 
of  CRPS.  The  neurological  deficit  on  admission  was 
evaluated  by  NIHSS.  The  outcome  at  hospital  discharge 
was  assessed  by  MBI.  Written  informed  consent  was 
obtained 
If  patients  were  un-
communicative,  consent  was  obtained  from  a  guardian 
or  close  relatives.  This  study  was  approved  by  the  eth-
ics  review  committee  of  the  Medical  Research  Institute, 
School  of  Medicine,  Kyung  Hee  University  (20040915).
    Blood  samples  for  DNA  extraction  from  each  subject 
were  collected  in  EDTA-coated  tubes  and  then  stored  in 

a −20oC  refrigerator.  Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  us-

Ⓡ
  DNA  mini  kit  (QIAGEN,  Valencia,  CA, 
ing  the  QIAamp
USA).  Genotypes  were  determined  by  direct  sequencing 
(MACROGEN,  Seoul,  Korea).  Polymerase  chain  reactions 
(PCRs)  were  performed  with  the  following  primers  for 
rs1800682  (sense,  5’-TCACCAGAGCACGAAAGAATTA-3’; 
antisense,  5’-GGCTTCTGCTGTAGTTCAACCT-3’;  prod-
uct  size,  423  bp)  and  rs763110  (sense,  5’-TGCCTATA-
ATCCCAGCTACTCA-3’;  antisense,  5’-CCAGAGAAGTC-
ACTCCCACATT-3’;  product  size,  383  bp).  The  PCR 
products  were  sequenced  using  an  ABI  PRISM  3730XL 
analyzer  (PE  Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA). 
Sequencing  data  were  analyzed  using  SeqManII  soft-
ware  (DNASTAR  Inc.,  Madison,  WI,  USA).
    SNPStats  (http://bioinfo.iconcologia.net/index.php?module
=Snpstats),  SNPAnalyzer  (ISTECH  Inc.,  Goyang,  Korea), 
and  Helixtree  (Golden  Helix  Inc.,  MT,  USA)  were  used  to 
evaluate  the  genetic  data.  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium

gression  models  (codominant,  dominant,  and  recessive) 
were  used  to  determine  odds  ratios  (ORs),  95%  con-
fidence  intervals  (CIs),  and  p-values.  The  required  sam-
ple size for statistical power was estimated using a genet-
ic  power  calculator  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/

tests  was  set  at  p＜0.05.

Results  and  Discussion

The  clinical  features  of  stroke  patients  and  control  sub-
jects  are  shown  in  Table  1.  The  mean  ages  of  stroke 
patients  and  control  subjects  were  59.85±11.94 

(mean±SD)  and  53.18±13.69  years,  respectively.  Pa-
tients  were  divided  into  3  clinical  phenotypes,  according 
to  NIHSS  (scores  of  neurological  deficit  on  admission; 
＜6,  n=92  and  ＞6,  n=128),  MBI  (scores  for  outcome  at 
hospital  discharge;  ＜60,  n=117  and  ＞60,  n=42),  and 

CRPS  (presence  and  absence;  ＋,  n=35  and −,  n=185).

p=0.04)  and  dominant  models  (OR=0.51,  95%  CI= 
0.30-0.87,  p=0.011).  The  genotype  distributions  of 
rs1800682  were  in  HWE  (p＞0.05),  but  rs763110  was 
not  in  HWE  (p＜0.05)  (data  not  shown).  The  failed  re-
sults  of  HWE  for  rs763110  may  be  due  to  the  small 
sample  size.  Therefore,  we  did  not  analyze  the  results 
of  rs763110  in  the  next  experiments.  In  Table  3,  the 
genotype  distributions  of  rs1800682  were  different  be-
tween  IS  and  controls  in  the  codominant  (OR=0.30, 
95%  CI=0.12-0.74,  p=0.025),  dominant  (OR=0.44,  95% 
CI=0.23-0.88,  p=0.018),  and  recessive  models  (OR=0.45, 
95%  CI=0.21-0.99,  p=0.042).  The  rs1800682  SNP  was 
associated  with  ICH  in  the  dominant  model  (OR=0.49, 
95%  CI=0.26-0.94,  p=0.031),  while  rs1800682  was  not 
associated  with  SAH.  As  shown  in  Table  4,  we  did  not 
find  any  associations  between  rs1800682  and  the  3  clin-
ical  phenotypes  (NIHSS,  MBI,  and  CRPS).  We  calcu-
lated  the  sample  power  using  a  genetic  power  calcula-
tor.  The  sample  power  of  the  stroke  group  was  0.9604 
for  rs1800682  (α=0.05,  genotype  relative  risk=2-fold, 
number  of  cases  for  80%  power=125).  Although  the 
number  of  stroke  cases  was  small,  this  calculation 
shows  that  sample  size  was  relatively  high  enough  to 
detect  statistical  differences.  Previously,  we  reported  no 
association  between  rs1800682  and  stroke  (Seo  et al., 
2002).  The  opposite  result  may  due  to  the  small  sample 
size  (stroke  patients,  n=91;  controls,  n=103).  To  confirm 
our  results,  another  study  should  be  conducted  in  an-
other  population.
    Stroke  is  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  and  the 
leading  cause  of  disability  in  Korea.  Brain  damage  fol-
lowing  stroke  results  from  the  complex  interaction  of 
multiple  pathways,  including  excitotoxicity,  acidotoxicity, 

FAS  Promoter  SNP  and  Stroke    209

ionic 
imbalance,  periinfarct  depolarization,  oxidative 
stress,  inflammation,  and  apoptosis  (Dolye et al.,  2008). 
Cell  death  after  cerebral  ischemia  appears  to  be  due  to 
necrosis,  but  many  neurons  in  the  ischemic  penumbra 
or  periinfarct  zone  undergo  apoptosis  (Broughton et al., 
2009).  There  are  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic  pathways  for 
the  activation  of  apoptosis.  Intrinsic  mechanisms  of 
apoptosis  activate  the  mitochondrial  apoptotic  pathway, 
characterized  by  changes  in  B-cell  CLL/lymphoma  2 
(BCL2)  family  proteins,  cytochrome c  release,  and  cas-
pase  3  activation.  Extrinsic  mechanisms  of  apoptosis  in-
volve  the  death  receptor  pathway.  The  FAS/FASLG  in-
teraction  initiates  apoptosis,  triggering  recruitment  of 
FADD.  FADD  contains  a  death  effector  domain,  which 
binds  to  procaspase  8.  This  complex  (FALG-FAS-FADD- 
procaspase  8)  is  known  as  DISC,  catalyzing  the  proteo-
lytic  cleavage  of  procaspase  8  to  generate  caspase  8 
(Love,  2003;  Sugawara et al.,  2004).  Disregulated  apop-
tosis  has  been  implicated  in  neurodegenerative  dis-
orders,  including  Alzheimer  disease,  Parkinson  disease, 
and  multiple  sclerosis.  The  FAS/FASLG  system  is  a  key 
regulator  in  neuronal  cell  apoptosis  (Ethelland  and 
Buhler,  2003;  Reich et al.,  2008).  Stroke  causes  several 
neurological  complications,  such  as  hemiparalysis,  dys-
phasia, facial palsy, and motor disorder. Therefore, we hy-

In  our  control 
group,  the  TT,  TG,  and  CC  genotype  frequencies  were 
0.29,  0.48,  and  0.23,  which  are  similar  to  those  seen  in 
the  Japanese  population.  The  CC,  CT,  and  TT  genotype 
frequencies  of  rs763110  have  been  reported  to  be 
0.431,  0.414,  and  0.0.155  in  Europeans;  0.489,  0.422, 
and  0.089  in  Chinese;  and  0.558  0.349,  and  0.093  in 
Japanese  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/BUILD132).  In 
our  control  group,  the  CC,  CT,  and  TT  genotype  fre-
quencies  were  0.530,  0.460,  and  0.01,  which  are  similar 
to  those  seen  in  the  Japanese  population.

    In  conclusion,  promoter  SNP  (rs1800682,  −670C/T) 

in  FAS  is  associated  with  stroke.  In  the  analysis  of 
stroke  types,  rs1800682  was  also  associated  with  IS 
and  ICH.  We  divided  stroke  patients  into  3  clinical  sub-
groups  based  on  NIHSS  score,  MBI  score,  and  CRPS, 
but  we  did  not  find  any  significant  associations  between 
the  3  clinical  phenotypes  and  rs1800682.  Considering 
the  small  sample  size  of  our  study,  additional  studies 
with  large  samples  and  different  populations  should  be 
conducted  to  confirm  our  results. 
    Our  results  suggest  that  the  promoter  SNP  rs1800682 

(−670C/T)  in  FAS  may  contribute  to  the  susceptibility  to 

stroke  in  the  Korean  population.
