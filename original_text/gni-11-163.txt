Earlier issues in this year have focused on the theme of 
epigenomics. This issue starts with a review on the interplay 
between epigenetics and cancer genetics, which is followed 
by two review articles on cancer genomics. One of the pri-
mary goals of cancer genomics is to translate its discovery to 
clinical  practice.  Subsequent  review  articles  provide  per-
spectives  on  clinical  informatics  and  methods  on  how  to 
prioritize  disease-related  genes  from  next-generation  se-
quencing data. Genome-wide data should be interpreted in 
the  context  of  systems  biology,  and  the  following  review 
articles offers comprehensive information on network bio-

logy and its applications. The next two review articles handle 
often overlooked but essential components of genomics, i.e., 
biobanks  and  ethical  standards.  We  have  two  additional 
reviews, totaling 10.

A couple of original research articles also address cancer 
genomics.  The  remaining  five  articles  and  an  application 
note cover a wide range of genomics and informatics. In this 
issue,  we  have  five  articles  in  total  that  have  been  con-
tributed from outside of Korea. We hope that Genomics & 
Informatics will advance next year to become a truly inter-
national journal that is authored and read worldwide.
