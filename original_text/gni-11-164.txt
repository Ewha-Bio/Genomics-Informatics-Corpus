Genomic instability, which occurs through both genetic mechanisms (underlying inheritable phenotypic variations caused by 
DNA  sequence-dependent  alterations,  such  as  mutation,  deletion,  insertion,  inversion,  translocation,  and  chromosomal 
aneuploidy)  and  epigenomic  aberrations  (underlying  inheritable  phenotypic  variations  caused  by  DNA  sequence-inde-
pendent alterations caused by a change of chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications), is 
known to promote tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Mechanisms involve both genomic instability and epigenomic 
aberrations that lose or gain the function of genes that impinge on tumor suppression/prevention or oncogenesis. Growing 
evidence  points  to  an  epigenome-wide  disruption  that  involves  large-scale  DNA  hypomethylation  but  specific  hyper-
methylation of tumor suppressor genes, large blocks of aberrant histone modifications, and abnormal miRNA expression 
profile. Emerging molecular details regarding the modulation of these epigenetic events in cancer are used to illustrate the 
alterations of epigenetic molecules, and their consequent malfunctions could contribute to cancer biology. More recently, 
intriguing  evidence  supporting  that  genetic  and  epigenetic  mechanisms  are  not  separate  events  in  cancer  has  been 
emerging; they intertwine and take advantage of each other during tumorigenesis. In addition, we discuss the collusion 
between epigenetics and genetics mediated by heterochromatin protein 1, a major component of heterochromatin, in order 
to maintain genome integrity.

Genomic Instability in Cancer 

Cancers have traditionally been accepted as diseases that 
are induced by the accumulation of a set of genetic mutations 
that have been considered the major causes of neoplasia [1]. 
But,  is  genomic  instability  a  consequence  of  cancer  pro-
gression or indeed a cause that drives cancer development? 
From about 1902 up until now, the involvement of genomic 
instability  in  tumorigenesis  has  long  been  the  subjet  of 
debate. In the beginning, Theodor Boveri’s work with sea 
urchins showed that all chromosomes are required for nor-
mal  development,  known  as  the  Boveri-Sutton  chromo-
some theory. He had also suggested in 1902 that malignant 
tumors might be the result of a certain abnormal condition of 
the chromosomes, which may arise from multipolar mitosis. 
In the last century, remarkable findings and progresses in 
cancer  research  have  added  genomic  instability  to  the 
hallmark list of cancer. Moreover, genomic instability gene-
rates the genetic and phenotypic heterogenicity and diversity 
that expedite tumorigenesis and the acquisition of cancer 

hallmarks.

Our genomes are constantly threatened by a number of 
challenges that are originating from extracellular and intra-
cellular stimuli. Effective cellular responses to these enor-
mous genotoxic stresses are acutely required to maintain 
genomic  integrity.  These  stresses  can  induce  a  variety  of 
problems  in  the  DNA,  such  as  double-strand  breaks, 
single-strand breaks, oxidative lesions, and pyrimidine di-
mers.  Eukaryotes  have  evolved  elaborate  DNA  damage 
response  (DDR)  mechanisms  to  properly  respond  to  the 
genotoxic stresses of these lesions. DNA damage induces 
several cellular responses, including checkpoint activation, 
DNA repair, and the triggering of apoptotic pathways for 
irreparable DNA damage (Fig. 1). Underlying these DDRs 
are  functions  of  many  tumor  suppressors,  which  are  fre-
quently lost in cancers. To keep the genome intact, DNA 
replication must be carried out without error, and if there is 
a mistake, it should be repaired correctly. Also, to give time 
for cells to repair any defect, cells must have intact check-
point  responses.  Replicated  genomes  must  be  passed  to

genetic  code,  but  it  has  to  be  copied  into  RNA  as  an 
intermediate messenger or non-coding functional compo-
nent.  This  copying  process,  transcription,  is  regulated  at 
several  steps,  including  initiation,  elongation,  and  termi-
nation, by a variety of mechanisms. Moreover, eukaryotic 
transcription  has  to  deal  with  chromatin  templates,  such 
that histone modifications and chromatin remodeling vastly 
affect gene expression. Several types of cancers and genetic 
disorders are often associated with abnormal transcription, 
highlighting the importance of regulated transcription in the 
pathology and prevention of cancers.

Part of the genome has no transcribed information, which, 
however, has functional roles by various mechanisms. For 
example, cis elements (DNA sequences) can act as regu-
latory  elements  for  transcription  and  replication.  Also, 
centromeric DNA is required for mitotic and meiotic chro-
matin  structure,  and  telomeric  DNA  plays  a  role  in 
sheltering the ends of chromosomes and eventually guar-
ding the genome. Indeed, centromeric and telomeric hetero-
chromatin structures consist of specific repetitive sequen-
ces, which play a role in maintaining genomic integrity, such 
that  heterochromatin  structure  is  required  for  accurate 
chromosome segregation (centromere) and inhibiting DNA 
breakages and nonhomologous end-joining (telomere). An-
euploidy  and  chromosomal  rearrangement,  which  are 
frequently observed in many cancers, are in part caused by 
aberrant chromatin structure.

Generally,  genomic  instability  is  often  associated  with 
cancer and can be indicative of a poor prognosis for some 
types of cancer. Lately, this concept has now been expanded 
to the field of epigenetics, and disorganization of epigenetic 
regulatory mechanisms is prevalent in cancer [5, 6]. Par-
ticular gene expression is determined not only by the genetic 
status of gene itself but also by epigenetic features, such as 
promoter regions, enhancers, and insulators, in chromatin 
and chromatin-modifying enzymes.

Mutations in tumor suppressors and/or oncogenes induce 
a loss or gain of function, respectively, and abnormal expres-
sion of these genes are likely to be linked to cancer initiation. 
Feinberg proposed a hypothesis that epigenetic alterations 
can induce genetic changes and contribute to tumor pro-
gression and also initiation [7]. Epigenetic changes occur 
without a change in the DNA sequence, and they can be 
induced  by  various  factors,  such  as  chromatin  structure, 
including DNA methylation, histone variants, and modifi-
cations;  nucleosome  remodeling;  and  small  non-coding 
regulatory RNAs (Fig. 2) [8]. In addition to histone proteins, 
DNA is associated with several nonhistone chromosomal 
proteins,  including  high-mobility  group  and  heterochro-
matin protein 1 (HP1), which can also play an important 
regulatory  role  in  DNA-dependent  processes,  such  as 

Fig. 1. On the road to cancer: genomic instability. Failure of DNA
damage  responses  that  conduct  surveillance  and  checkpoints  to 
guard  genome  causes  genomic  instability,  the  most  common 
characteristic  of  human  cancers.  It  has  therefore  been  proposed 
that genomic instability contributes to and drives tumor initiation 
and development. Defects in the DNA damage responses generate
genomic  instability  and  facilitate  tumorigenesis.

daughter cells without error; therefore, either miscopying or 
missegregation of chromosomes should be avoided. If these 
self-guarding machineries are not effective, cells that have 
problems  should  die.  So,  DNA  replication,  DNA  repair, 
transcription,  cell  cycle  machinery,  chromosome  segrega-
tion, and apoptosis are six domains to keep genomic inte-
grity. Also, these DDRs are coordinately regulated and work 
together, via a series of signaling pathways that eventually 
activate surveillance and checkpoints for genomic integrity. 
In other words, cancer cells have problems in these machi-
neries, leading to genomic instability.

Epigenetics and Cancer 

The word “epigenetics” was termed in the early 1940s to 
describe the events that could not be wholly explained by 
traditional genetics [2]. Conrad Waddington (1905‒1975) 
defined epigenetics as “the branch of biology which studies 
the causal interactions between genes and their products 
which bring the phenotype into being” [3]. The epigenetic 
field  now  actively  uncovers  the  molecular  mechanisms 
underlying  these  phenomena,  and  epigenetics  has  been 
defined today as “the study of changes in gene function that 
are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not 
entail  a  change  in  DNA  sequence”  [4].  In  other  words, 
epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression or 
phenotype,  caused  by  mechanisms  other  than  DNA  se-
quences, and some of these epigenetic changes have even 
been shown to be heritable.

and  noncoding  RNAs. 

transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair, 
in a similar manner to histones. 

Histone modifications and cancer

Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin that are 
composed of DNA wrapped around 8 histone core proteins 
[9]. One of best understood epigenetic mechanisms is his-
tone  modification.  The  histone  N-terminal  tails  protrude 
from nucleosome cores and thus are subject to numerous 
modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphory-
lation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, and citrullination, 
creating a massively complex bar code. It is thought that 
activating or repressive complexes are recruited to DNA and 
reshape chromatin into relaxed or a tightly packed structure, 
based  on  the  histone  code－instructions  through  a  com-
bination  of  histone  modifications  [10].  Like  a  writer, 
histone-modifying  enzymes  write  the  histone  code  via 
histone modifications and mark specific sites of the genome 
with histone modifications－for example, active promoter 
regions that are marked with augmented trimethylation in 
H3  at  lysine  4  (H3K4me3)  inactive  promoters  that  are 
marked  with  augmented  trimethylated  H3  at  lysine  27 
(H3K27me3) or trimethylated H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3), 
and enhancers that are marked with monomethylated H3 at 
lysine  4  (H3K4me1)  and/or  acetylated  H3  at  lysine  27 
(H3K27ac) [11-13]. These histone modification patterns are 
regulated by a variety of enzymes, including histone acetyl-
transferases and deacetylases, which introduce and remove 
acetyl groups, respectively. Similarly, histone methyltrans-
ferases  (HMTs)  and  demethylases  introduce  and  remove 
methyl groups. The combination of histone modifications 
largely affects gene expression by the recruitment of tran-

scriptional  regulatory  proteins,  which  bind  to  specific 
modified histone markings. Thus, a combination of histone 
modifications acts as a histone code－high-level information 
residing above the genetic code, which is genetic information 
stored in the form of DNA.

Aberrant patterns of histone modification marks are often 
found in cancer. Advances in high-throughput sequencing 
have  allowed  for  genome-wide  mapping  of  chromatin 
changes that occur during tumor initiation and progression 
[8]. A recent report suggested that cancer cells often ex-
perience  losses  of  histone  acetylation  and  methylation, 
occurring predominantly at the acetylated Lys16 and trime-
thylated Lys20 residues in histone H4. These losses are also 
associated  with  the  hypomethylation  of  repetitive  DNA 
sequences, which is a well-known characteristic of cancer 
cells [14].

DNA methylation and cancer

One of the best studied epigenetic signals is DNA methy-
lation. In contrast to a dazzling variety of histone modifi-
cations,  DNA  methylation  is  a  simple  covalent  chemical 
modification, resulting in the attachment of a methyl (CH3) 
group at the 5' carbon position of the cytosine ring. When 
methyl  groups  are  attached  to  the  DNA  in  genes,  trans-
cription of these genes is usually turned off, and then these 
genes are silenced. When a cell divides, its DNA is copied via 
replication  and  divided  equally  into  two  daughter  cells 
during  mitosis.  During  this  process,  the  pattern  of  DNA 
methylation can also be copied onto the new daughter DNA, 
allowing the information that determines whether a gene is 
“on” or “off” to be inherited to the two daughter cells [15].
DNA  methylation  in  mammals  occurs  mostly  at  CpG 
dinucleotides, and methylation of CpG islands explains a 
stable gene silencing mechanism [15]. In normal somatic 
cells, most (over 50%) CpG islands are unmethylated. DNA 
methylation  is  important  for  the  regulation  of  non-CpG 
islands, CpG island promoters, and repetitive sequences to 
maintain  genome  stability  [15,  16].  Furthermore,  DNA 
methylation plays important roles in X chromosome inac-
tivation, imprinting, embryonic development, silencing of 
repetitive elements and germ cell-specific genes, differen-
tiation,  and  maintenance  of  pluripotency  [16-18].  DNA 
methylation is controlled by a family of DNA methyltrans-
ferases (DNMTs) that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups 
from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the 5' position of cytosine 
bases  in  the  CpG  dinucleotide.  Methyl-binding  domain 
(MBD) proteins, such as MeCP2, MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4, 
bind  to  methylated  CpG  sites  and  are  involved  in  tran-
scriptional repression [19].

In  cancer,  hypomethylation  usually  occurs  at  repeated 
DNA sequences, such as long interspersed nuclear elements,

whereas  hypermethylation  predominantly  involves  CpG 
islands  [20].  DNA  hypermethylation  has  been  shown  to 
result  in  abnormal  silencing  of  several  tumor  suppressor 
genes in most types of cancer [21]. Thus, DNA methylation 
is grossly reduced, but DNA hypermethylation is specifically 
and locally augmented at CpG islands at tumor suppressor 
genes  (Table  1);  yet,  its  involvement  and  role  in  tumori-
genesis remain controversial. Yet, experimental progress has 
added an emerging epigenetic aberration, “aberrant DNA 
methylation,” to an established cancer hallmark, “genomic 
instability.” DNA hypermethylation at tumor suppressors or 
genes having tumor suppressive functions is more frequent 
than their mutations in cancer cells. Hundreds to thousands 
of genes are hypermethylated in cancer cells, while only tens 
of genes are mutated. Epigenetic silencing via DNA methy-
lation  results  in  gene  inactivation  and  promotes  carcino-
genesis,  indicating  that  DNA  methylation  impinges  on 
carcinogenesis.

MicroRNA and cancer 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-
coding  RNAs  that  have  epigenetic  functions  in  post- 
transcriptional  regulation  of  gene  expression  via  mRNA 
degradation or sequestering and translational repression and 
have  physiologically  essential  roles  in  most  cellular  pro-
cesses. Therefore, their dysfunction is implicated in human 
diseases, including cancer, as well as inherited diseases and 
developmental defects. The human genome may encode over 
1,400 miRNAs, which frequently target many genes related 
to cancer development or prevention [22]. In light of the 
linkage between miRNA and cancer, they have been cate-
gorized into three groups: oncogenic, tumor-suppressive, or 
context-dependent miRNAs [23]. In tumorigenesis, the loss 
of tumor-suppressive miRNAs promotes the expression of 
target oncogenes, while increased expression of oncogenic 
miRNAs can repress target tumor suppressor genes [23]. 
Mutations in a miRNA can disrupt its recognition of binding 

targets  and  further  result  in  oncogene  activation  and/or 
tumor suppressor repression. Indeed, oncogenic miRNAs, 
such as miR-155, miR-21, and miR-17 to -92, whose expres-
sion triggers cancer development, appear to be amplified, 
and  tumor  suppressive  miRNAs,  such  as  miR-146  and 
miR-15  to  -16,  whose  loss  triggers  cancer  development, 
appear  to  be  downregulated  in  cancers  [23].  Moreover, 
mutations  of  miRNAs,  including  miR-101  and  miR-29, 
targeting epigenetically modifying enzymes, such as EZH2 
[24, 25] and DNMT3 [26], respectively, are often found in 
human cancers. Aberrant expression or mutation of such 
miRNAs is likely to further reinforce extensive and heavy 
epigenetic alterations [23, 27]  and might  have  effects  on 
histone or DNA methylation at promoters of other miRNAs 
that  target  oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressors.  Under- 
expression of miR-127, which targets BCL6, is correlated 
with abnormal methylation at its promoter in cancer [28]. In 
the  course  of  remarkable  progress  in  the  study  of  cancer 
epigenetics,  new  observations  linking  aberrant  miRNA 
expression and tumorigenesis imply that miR-mimic mole-
cules  might  serve  as  effective  therapeutics  by  replacing 
tumor suppressor miRs or targeting oncogenic miRs.

Epigenetics  and  Genetics  Cooperates  in 
Cancer Development

Many types of human cancers and disorders/diseases are 
often induced by misregulation of gene expression. Mechas-
nims for this misregulation involve both genetic mutations 
(genetic instability) and epigenetic modifications that dis-
rupt the function of genes, including tumor suppressor and 
oncogenes,  as  well  as  other  genes  related  to  cancer,  via 
altered activity or expression of the products of the genes. 
Given the importance of epigenetic dysregulation in tumor 
initiation and development, differentiating causative “dri-
vers”  (causes)  and  resulting  “passengers”  (outcomes)  is 
becoming an important priority for cancer biology as well as

epigenetics.  Driver  genes  have  to  be  essential  for  cancer 
causation, whereas passenger genes are not necessary [29]. 
By the development and improvement of technology, it may 
eventually  be  possible  to  accurately  and  minutely  distin-
guish epigenetic aberrations of driver genes [30, 31]. Many 
current clinical investigations and trials of epigenetics-based 
cancer  therapy,  highlighting  the  reciprocal  regulation  of 
epigenetically  modifying  enzymes,  miRNAs,  and  genetic 
defects in cancer, have come from scientific discoveries of 
how epigenetic aberrations in cancer manage to play a key 
role  at  every  stage  of  tumorigenesis  and  have  such  a 
profound impact on the underlying mechanisms of tumo-
rigenesis.  Nevertheless,  cooperation  between  epigenetics 
and  genetics  in  tumorigenesis  (Fig.  3)  is  the  subject  of 
debate. The interconnection between these two processes 
becomes increasingly apparent, in large part because it is 
realized that mutations of various epigenetic modifier genes 
are associated with human cancers [32]. The mutation of 
epigenetic  modifiers  presumably  fosters  profound  epige-
netic anomalies in terms of DNA methylation, histone modi-
fications, miRNA, and nucleosome positioning and occu-
pancy, which expedites global dysregulation of gene expres-
sion. Underlying this dysregulated epigenome is genomic 
instability, which generates mutations in epigenetic modi-
fiers  that  induce  abnormal  gene  expression,  which  may 
predispose one to cancer [32], although this remains to be 
demonstrated. Insight into its underlying mechanisms helps 
establish  the  epigenetic  involvement  in  tumorigenesis. 

Fig.  3.  Epigenetic  silencing  is  more  frequent  that  mutations  in 
cancer cells. In cancer cells, hundreds to thousands of genes are 
hypermethylated  (DNA  methylation),  histone  codes  at  more  than 
thousands  of  genes  are  aberrantly  modified  via  histone  modifi-
cations or histone variant compositions, and miRNA expression is
dysregulated, while tens of genes are affected by mutations. Both
epigenetic silencing and inactivating mutations or deletions result
in  gene  inactivation.

Because epigenetic processes involve a number of overlap-
ping  and  interconnected  mechanisms  and  pathways,  it  is 
difficult  to  definitely  identify  the  cellular  and  molecular 
identities and the mechanism(s) underlying the epigenetic 
outcomes and phenotype. Based on studies of cell lines that 
have  originated  from  tumor  tissues  and  tissue  samples 
collected from  cancer patients, aberrant epigenetic  marks 
can  result  in  inappropriate  expression  of  genes  that  are 
associated  with  cancer  (tumor  suppressors  and/or  onco-
genes). It is now generally accepted that human cancer cells 
harbor global epigenetic abnormalities and that epigenetic 
alterations may be the key to tumor initiation and develop-
ment [5, 6, 8]. The cancer epigenome is characterized by 
substantial changes in various epigenetic regulatory layers; 
herein, we introduce some important examples of epigenetic 
disruptions  that  cause  mutations  of  key  genes  and/or 
alterations of signaling pathways in cancer development.

However,  this  idea  has  now  been  expanded  to  be  a 
scientific norm by consolidating and incorporating the al-
tered epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that are common 
and prevalent in cancer [5, 6]. Both genetics and epigenetics 
ultimately involve abnormal gene expression－i.e., pheno-
type. The expression level of a particular gene is determined 
by its context at the genetic level, which consists of several 
cis  elements,  including  promoters,  regulatory  regions, 
enhancers, and insulators, each of which recruits specific 
transcriptional  proteins  for  activation,  repression,  and 
constitutive or facultative transcription by various mecha-
nisms. In other words, cis elements can act as a primary 
platform for recruiting epigenome-modifying enzymes and/ 
or chromatin remodeling factors. The modified epigenome 
follows immediately and acts as a secondary platform for 
transcriptional effector machinery. Finally, transcription is 
turned on or off, and its level is determined by the overall 
epigenomic context. 

The genetic road to cancer is relatively straightforward: 
mutation  of  tumor  suppressors  and/or  oncogenes  causes 
either a loss or gain of function and abnormal expression－
namely  the  very  relationship  between  altered  genotype- 
altered  phenotype.  On  the  contrary,  there  are  no  genetic 
changes  but  a  sick  phenotype  in  the  epigenetic  road  to 
cancer.  The  epigenetic  pathway  to  cancer  is  much  more 
complicated  and  roundabout  and  is  determined  by  inte-
grating  numerous  epigenetic  variations,  including  DNA 
methylation, histone variants and modifications, and nucle-
osome remodeling, as well as small non-coding regulatory 
RNAs (Fig. 2) [8]. During tumor initiation and progression, 
the epigenome undergoes multiple alterations, including a 
genome-wide loss of DNA methylation (hypomethylation), 
frequent increases in promoter methylation of CpG islands, 
and aberrant changes in nucleosome occupancy and histone

modification profile, and these epigenetic aberrations drive 
tumor cell heterogeneity, as well as tumorigenesis.

Epigenetic aberration is a major feature of cancer, but its 
etiological role in tumor development remains controversial. 
This contrasts with genomic instability, which is known to 
produce cancer-causing mutations. Recent evidence demon-
strates that a dysregulated epigenome can promote tumo-
rigenesis via altered gene expression; however, the question 
of whether a dysregulated epigenome can predispose one to 
DNA  damage  and  generate  genomic  instability  remains 
clearly  unaddressed.  Only  few  possible  mechanisms  have 
been  proposed;  one  possible  mechanism  by  which  chro-
mosome  segregation  errors  promote  tumorigenesis  is  by 
inhibiting chromosome condensation for mitotic entry or 
destabilizing heterochromatin at centromeres, which facili-
tates chromosomal misalignment and accelerates the for-
mation of unattached chromosomes or malfunctioning spin-
dles.  A second  mechanism is  chromosomal breakage  and 
non-homologous  end-joining,  which  result  in  chromo-
somal rearrangement and extensive structural alterations in 
chromosomes.  Third,  a  dysregulated  epigenome  at  telo-
meres  promotes  its  elongation  or  chromosomal  rearran-
gement.  Intriguingly,  histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  or 
knockdown/knockout of epigenome modifiers can induce 
DNA damage, but whether this DNA damage can indeed 
predispose one to cancer remains unestablished. 

Epigenetic Control by HP1 Ensures Genome 
Integrity
Heterochromatin protein 1 

HP1 was originally identified in Drosophila, functioning in 
heterochromatin-mediated  gene  silencing.  Three  different 
paralogs of HP1 are found in Drosophila melanogaster: HP1a, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

HP1b, and HP1c. Subsequently, orthologs of HP1 were also 
discovered  in  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  (Swi6),  xenopus 
(Xhp1α  and  Xhp1γ),  chicken  (CHCB1,  CHCB2,  and 
CHCB3), and mammals (HP1α, HP1β, and HP1γ) (Fig. 4) 
[33, 34]. HP1 binds directly to the methylated K9 residue of 
histone  H3  (H3K9me),  a  surrogate  marker  for  tran-
scriptionally repressive heterochromatin, and is critical for 
its maintenance [35-37]. Therefore, its canonical functions 
include  maintaining  heterochromatin  integrity  as  a  fun-
damental  unit  of  heterochromatin,  silencing  by  hetero-
chromatin formation, and gene repression by heterochro-
matization of euchromatin. HP1 proteins are characterized 
by two conserved domains: the chromodomain (CD) in its 
N-terminus and the chromo shadow domain (CSD) in the 
C-terminus (Fig. 4). The CD has been shown to directly bind 
H3K9me, while the CSD is implicated in interacting with a 
partner protein and its homo- and hetero-dimerization. Two 
CD and CSD domains are separated by a hinge domain that 
is involved in DNA and RNA binding (Figs. 4 and 5) [38, 39]. 
HP1  interacts  with  numerous  epigenomic  modifiers  with 
different cellular functions in different organisms (Fig. 5). 
Some  of  these  HP1-interacting  partners  are  histone 
methyltransferse, DNMT, and methyl CpG-binding protein 
MeCP2 (Fig. 5), supporting its role in epigenomic modifi-
cation. 

HP1 and chromatin structure

HP1 proteins are mostly enriched at heterochromatin cen-
tromeres and pericentromeric regions, telomeres and sub-
telomeric  regions,  and  transcriptionally  repressive  genes. 
However, HP1 is also found at euchromatic sites [40, 41],

though whether euchromatic HP1 has a disparate function 
and which HP1 paralog is located at euchromatin remain 
unclarified. A structure-based study revealed that a hydro-
phobic pocket of the HP1 CD interacts with histone H3K9me 
[42].  This  epigenetic  mark  is  generated  by  a  conserved 
family  of  HMTs,  named  after  the  Drosophila  member  SU 
(VAR)3-9,  discovered  as  a  suppressor  factor  involved  in 
position-effect  variegation  [43,  44].  Both  HP1  and  SU 
(VAR)3-9  function  in  heterochromatin  structure  forma-
tion. Loss of SU(VAR)3-9 results in displacement of HP1 
from  heterochromatic  regions  and  alteration  in  gene  re-
pression  [45].  Mechanisms  by  which  HP1  localizes  to 
euchromatin sites appear to involve more than the recog-
nition of H3K9me, which is poorly understood. An alter-
native  mechanism  of  localization  might  be  mediated  via 
interactions between its CSD and other factors. HP1 CSD 
homodimerizes through an alpha-helical region and gene-
rates a platform that can interact with the PxVxL motif in its 
interacting partner proteins, such as DNMT1/3, SU(VAR) 
3-9, and the p150 subunit of CAF-1 (Fig. 5) [46]. A second 
alternative mechanism of localization on chromatin involves 
interactions with RNA through a hinge domain, such that 
association of HP1 with specific loci in Drosophila and centric 
regions  in  mouse  makes  them  susceptible  to  RNase 
treatment [39, 47]. For example, it has been demonstrated 
that an HP1 subcode with sumoylation plays a role in hete-
rochromatin  architecture,  via  its  association  with  micro-
satellite  RNAs  [48].  A  third  mechanism  for  chromatin 
localization  is  found  at  the  distal  ends  of  Drosophila 
telomeres, where HP1 is thought to bind DNA directly [49]. 
However,  in  mammals,  localization  of  HP1  proteins  to 
telomeric  regions  occurs  via  H3K9  association  [50-53]. 
Together,  HP1  localizes  to  chromatin  using  both  genetic 
(DNA  or  RNA  sequence)  and  epigenetic  (histone  modi-
fication) information.

HP1 subcode: above the histone code 

Recently, the “HP1 subcode” hypothesis is emerging in 
addition to the genetic code and histone code: a hypothesis 
that  the  transcription  of  genetic  information  encoded  in 
DNA－i.e.,  genetic  code－is  regulated  in  part  by  histone 
variants,  modifications,  and  nucleosome  occupancy.  The 
histone  code  hypothesis  states  that  the  type  and  com-
bination of histone modifications are interpreted by the cell 
as  instructions  for  organizing  gene  expression  and  con-
stitutes  the  most  advanced  conceptual  framework  for 
deciphering the genetic information cascades that regulate 
gene expression. Further, a combination of HP1 paralogs and 
modifications may be defined as a second regulatory layer of 
the  code－that  is,  a  subcode－involved  in  transcription, 
especially gene silencing, within the general context of the 

histone  code.  The  HP1  subcode  can  be  secondary-level 
information residing above the genetic and histone codes 
and  regulate  HP1  interactions  with  other  key  proteins, 
further modulating gene silencing and possibly replication, 
recombination,  and  DNA  repair.  In  this  review,  we  will 
discuss the interplay between genetics and epigenetics in 
cancer through HP1.

Pleiotropic functions of HP1

Besides heterochromatin formation and the maintenance 
functions  of  HP1,  this  protein  also  recruits  the  cohesin 
complex  to  pericentromeric  heterochromatin  for  centro-
meric sister chromatid cohesion. Recent studies have shown 
that  HP1  does  not  always  act  in  the  context  of  hetero-
chromatin  and  functions  in  gene  activation  and  telomere 
maintenance [38]. Furthermore, HP1 interacts with many 
different  proteins,  including  transcription  factors,  chro-
matin regulators, and DNA replication and repair factors, as 
well  as  components  of  the  nuclear  envelope  [54],  and 
functions via collaboration with its interacting proteins in 
diverse  cellular  processes,  including  mitosis  progression 
[55, 56], DNA damage repair [57-59], transcription [60-62], 
and chromatin remodeling (Figs. 4 and 5) [63, 64].

Whether  and  How  HP1  Is  Associated  with 
Cancer
HP1-mediated transcriptional regulation in response 
to DDR

Recently, we proposed a mechanism in which HP1 could 
recover transcription in response to DNA damage signals 
[60]. HP1 accumulates at the promoter before DNA damage, 
but BRCA1 is recruited to the promoter after the damage 
while promoter-resident HP1 is disassembled. Importantly, 
HP1 assembly is recovered post release from the damage in 
a  BRCA1-HP1  interaction-dependent  manner  and  simul-
taneously targets SUV39H1 to chromatin. HP1/SUV39H1 
restoration at the promoter results in BRCA1 disassembly 
and histone methylation. In the aftermath, transcriptional 
repression  resumes.  This  report  provides  a  partial  ex-
planation for the targeting of HP1 to a variety of chromatin 
structures  and  its  functions  in  constructing  de  novo 
heterochromatin  from  euchromatin  or  facultative  hetero-
chromatin, in  addition to maintaining previously existing 
heterochromatin. In addition, a role in the DDR for HP1, 
previously  implicated  in  heterochromatin  and  silencing, 
reveals  new connections  between tumor-suppressive pro-
cesses that maintain genome integrity.

HP1 depletion activates DDRs

Recent  studies  have  revealed  the  possible  link  of  HP1 

170

proteins to the DDR [59, 65, 66]. However, the spatial and 
temporal regulation of the association and dissociation of 
HP1 with chromatin in response to DNA damage remains 
unclear and controversial. A couple of studies have reported 
that  DNA  damage  induces  the  transient  dissociation  of 
inhibitory HP1 proteins from DNA damage sites in order to 
help  DNA  repair  proteins/complexes  gain  access  to 
chromatin [65, 66]. In contrast, another study has indicated 
that HP1 is recruited and associates at DNA damage sites, 
such as UV-induced DNA lesions and chromosomal breaks 
upon DNA damage, which helps the DDR via its dynamic 
dissociation and association with DNA damage sites [59]. 
Recently,  Lee  and  colleagues  [67]  have  shown  that  HP1 
promotes homologous recombination repair via recruitment 
of  BRCA1  to  damaged  chromatin.  Together,  chromatin 
protein  HP1  plays  some  unelucidated  roles  in  keeping 
genomic as well as epigenomic integrity.

Whether and how HP1 is related to cancer

An  aberrant epigenome  in cancer cells results from an 
altered  chromatin  structure  resulting  from  alterations  in 
chromatin-modifying enzymes and/or chromatin proteins. 
Examples  of  HP1γ-interacting  proteins  are  the  histone 
proteins, epigenetic modifiers, transcription factor family, 
DNA repair factors, and replication proteins (Fig. 5) [48, 
54-57, 60, 62, 63, 67-80]. The diversity of HP1γ-associated 
proteins has increased with the recent discovery that HP1γ 
interacts with BRCA1, a tumor suppressor that guards the 
genome. In addition,  HP1γ is  involved in  the  recovery of 
BRCA1-mediated  transcription  post-DDR.  There  is  no 
direct  evidence 
is  a  component  of 
BRCA1-mediated tumor suppression. However, a couple of 
tantalizing  observations  support  this  possibility:  HP1γ 
expression  is  elevated  in  prostate  cancer  [81],  and  in 
addition, depletion of HP1 paralogs activates the formation 
of DNA damage repair foci. HP1 paralogsare recruited to 
repair foci and promote DNA repair, following DNA damage. 
This raises the question of whether increased or decreased 
HP1γ  can  foster  or  suppress  tumor 
initiation  and 
development.  In  light  of  the  HP1γ-BRCA1  association,  it 
would be intriguing to test whether the genes encoding the 
HP1 family are also overexpressed in breast cancers. It would 
also be interesting to test whether the HP1 family impinges 
on genomic stability.
