Abstract

Biological  pathways  are  known  as  collections  of  knowl-
edge  of  certain  biological  processes.  Although  knowl-
edge  about  a  pathway  is  quite  significant  to  further 
analysis,  it  covers  only  tiny  portion  of  genes  that  exists. 
In  this  paper,  we  suggest  a  model  to  extend  each  in-
dividual  pathway  using  a  microarray  expression  data 
based  on  the  known  knowledge  about  the  pathway.  We 
take  the  Rosetta  compendium  dataset  to  extend  path-
ways  of  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  obtained  from  KEGG 
(Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  genes  and  genomes)  database. 
Before  applying  our  model,  we  verify  the  underlying  as-
sumption  that  microarray  data  reflect  the  interactive 
knowledge  from  pathway,  and  we  evaluate  our  scoring 
system  by  introducing  performance  function.  In  the  last 
step,  we  validate  proposed  candidates  with  the  help  of 
another  type  of  biological  information.  We  introduced  a 
pathway  extending  model  using  its  intrinsic  structure 
and  microarray  expression  data.  The  model  provides  the 
suitable  candidate  genes  for  each  single  biological  path-
way  to  extend  it.

Introduction

Biological  pathways  can  be  regarded  as  a  collection  of 
known  relations  or  reactions  between  biological  objects 
(i.e.  genes  or  gene  products).  But  the  knowledge  about 
biological  pathway  is  not  complete  and  insufficient  to 
cover  the  whole  number  of  genes  or  gene  products.  In 
case  of  human,  for  example,  about  3,000  genes  are

covered  by  the  major  biological  pathway  databases.  The 
rest  with  the  relation  with  other  genes  remains  to  be 
explored.  We  view  biological  pathways  as  a  set  of  bio-
logical  knowledge  that  should  be  expanded  by  using 
experimental  data  like  DNA  microarray  gene  expression 
data. 
    Recently,  microarray  gene  expression  datasets  are  in-
cessantly  cumulated  with  the  aid  of  recent  technological 
advances.  Analyzing  these  datasets  makes  it  possible  to 
measure  the  expressions  of  tens  of  thousands  of  genes 
simultaneously  under  various  experimental  conditions.  In 
this  paper,  we  propose  a  model,  PathPlus,  to  determine 
genes  for  biological  pathway  extension  by  combining 
the  knowledge  about  biological  pathways  and  the  ex-
perimental  data  from  DNA  microarray  experiments. 
    The  most  significant  feature  of  PathPlus  is  that  it  uses 
established  knowledge  (i.e  biological  pathway)  as  a  tem-
plate  to  expand  the  knowledge.  Previous  studies  try  to 
directly  infer  biological  networks  (or  pathways)  from 
gene  expression  data  by  various  computational  or  stat-
istical  means  without  using  prior  knowledge  (or  tem-
plate).  To  induce  networks  of  genes  or  proteins,  for  ex-
ample,  that  might  conjecture  biological  pathways  from 
large-scale  data,  some  construct  bayesian  networks 
from  gene  expression  data  or  infer  functional  protein 
complexes  from  protein  interaction  data  (Friedman et al., 
2000).  Others  combine  various  genomic  data  to  infer  bi-
ological  networks  without  using  prior  knowledge  about 
biological  interaction.  In  fact,  there  are  a  few  recent 
works  trying  to  reconstruct  biological  relations  based  on 
prior  knowledge  (Yamanishi et al.,  2004;  Kharchenko et 
al.,  2004).  Yamanishi et al.  uses  kernel  method  to  pre-
dict  new  gene-to-gene  interaction  within  metabolic  path-
way  and  bases  it  on  known  pathway  knowledge  by 
adopting  supervised  approach.  The  work  of  Kharchenko 
et al.  compares  established  metabolic  network  with  ex-
pression  profiles  to  find  genes  that  can  complete  a  met-
abolic  pathway  with  some  participants  missed.  While 
the  methods  are  good  in  finding  missing  genes,  they  do 
not  suggest  possible  new  members  (or  genes)  for  the 
given  biological  pathway  for  pathway  extension.
    We  first  observe  that  a  biological  pathway  contains 
highly  verified  information  but  covers  only  a  small  frac-
tion  of  genes,  while  microarray  data  provide  noisy  ex-
perimental  data  but  covers  the  whole  genome.  The  es-
sence  of  PathPlus  approach  is  to  determine  candidate 
genes  that  are  highly  likely  to  be  related  to  a  given 
pathway  by  combining  microarray  gene  expression  data

Graph  construction  from  biological  pathway

For  the  purpose  of  illustration  in  the  present  study,  we 
use  pathways  and  gene  expression  profiles  of  Sacchar-
omyces  cerevisiae.  KEGG  (Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  genes 
and  genomes)  database  (Kanehisa,  1996)  provides  88 
biological  pathways  for  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae.  We 
extracted  43  pathways  by  removing  those  containing 
less  than  12  genes  to  avoid  the  perturbation  caused  by 
the  scarcity  of  basis  knowledge.  KEGG  relations  are  div-
ided  into  three  categories:  EC  relation,  PP  relations  and 
GE  relation.  EC  relation  stands  for  relations  between 
two  genes  whose  protein  products  share  the  same  me-
tabolite  in  a  metabolic  pathway.  When  two  proteins  in-
teract  directly,  genes  coding  them  are  said  to  have  PP 
relation.  GE  relation  means  that  one  gene  or  its  product 
regulates  the  expression  of  the  other  gene.  In  addition, 
we  define  co-member  relation  that  refers  to  the  genes 
assigned  to  the  same  function  in  a  pathway.  To  con-
struct  a  pathway  graph  from  this  information,  we  make 
a  node  for  each  gene  and  link  a  pair  of  nodes  when 
they  are  assigned  one  of  the  relations  listed  above.

Graph  construction  from  microarray  expression 
data

As  a  source  of  microarray  expression  data,  we  use  the 
Rosetta  compendium  dataset  (Hughes  et al.,  2000), 
which  is  hitherto  the  most  systematic  approach  to  pro-
file  yeast  genes.  The  dataset  is  consisted  of  300  micro-
array  experiment  results,  which  contain  287  diverse 
gene  mutations  and  13  chemical  treatments.  They  all 
cover  6,153  genes  in  each  microarray  data.  The  log-ex-
pression  ratio  values  are  used  as  entries  of  expression 
matrix,  and  these  values  are  normalized  so  that  mean 
and  standard  deviation  of  each  column  are  0  and  1, 
respectively.
    The  whole  genes  in  the  microarray  dataset  make  no-
des  in  reference  graph  of  the  pathway  graph  for  each 
pathway  we  will  concern.  We  here  present  two  different 
methods 
the  microarray 
dataset.  Each  method  needs  thresholds  in  constructing 
graphs  and  we  will  give  criteria  to  optimize  threshold  so 
that  the  resulting  graph  reflects  the  biological  knowledge 
in  some  sense.
Method of linking co-DEGs:  The  process  of  identify-
ing  DEGs  (differentially  expressed  genes)  is  one  of  the 
major  steps  of  analyzing  gene  expression  data  under 
the  assumption  that  the  expression  data  are  modeled  to 
find  significant  changes  in  gene  expression  levels  be-
tween  treatment  conditions  and  control  conditions.

from 

Fig.  1.  Overview  of  PathPlus.  To  combine  biological  path-
way  and  microarray  gene  expression  data,  that  have  differ-
ent  data  structures,  we  transform  both  into  graphs,  pathway
graphs  and  reference  graphs.  Applying  a  scoring  system, 
we  obtain  a  set  of  candidate  genes  with  high  scores  for 
each  pathway.  The  set  is  verified  by  using  another  knowl-
edge  resource,  the  Gene  Ontology.

and  the  known  knowledge  about  the  biological  pathway 
(Fig.  1). 
    To  combine  biological  pathways  and  microarray  data-
sets,  that  are  very  different  in  data  structure,  we  trans-
form  both  into  a  common  template  structure,  a  graph. 
We  transform  each  pathway  into  a  graph  whose  nodes 
correspond  to  genes  or  gene  products  and  edges  to  bi-
ological  relations  between  them.  Then,  we  extract  from 
microarray  data  a  reference  graph  having  the  largest 
structural  similarity  with  the  given  pathway  graph  by  op-
timizing  the  parameters  of  graph  construction.  PathPlus 
provides  a  score  measuring  the  likelihood  of  a  gene  to 
be  related  to  a  pathway  using  the  structure  of  the  refer-
ence  graph.  The  scoring  system  is  based  on  the  cen-
trality  measures  introduced  by  the  social  network  analy-
sis  (Bogatti  et al.,  1997;  Faust,  1997).
    Finally,  we  obtain  sets  of  candidate  genes  with  high 
scores  for  biological  pathways  and  evaluate  the  results 
by  verifying  the  functions  of  the  candidate  genes  using 
another  heterogeneous  data,  the  Gene  Ontology  (GO), 
with  promising  results.  PathPlus  approach  may  contrib-
ute  to  establish  methodological  concepts  in  knowledge 
extension  and  to  give  insights  into  biologically  untapped 
territories.

Methods

To  combine  the  two  different  data  types,  biological 
pathways  and  microarray  gene-expression  data,  Path-
Plus  use  graph  as  the  common  template  for  analysis.  A 
graph  consists  of  a  set  of  nodes  and  a  set  of  edges. 
Nodes  represent  genes  (or  gene  products)  and  edges 
gene-to-gene  interactions  in  the  present  study.

for  optimizing  threshold  to  determining  DEGs  are  in-
troduced  and  applied  to  further  analysis  (Iyer  et al., 
1999;  Tusher  et al.,  2001;  Dudoit  et al.,  2002).  Linking 
co-DEGs  methods  constructs  a  graph  by  linking  two 
genes  that  are  co-DEGs,  i.e.,  they  are  DEGs  under 
same  experimental  condition.  The  method  was  applied 
to 
the  microarray  expression  dataset  with  various 
threshold  values.
Method of linking similarly expressed genes:  This 
method  is  the  way  of  determining  edges  based  on  ex-
pression  similarity.  In  this  paper,  the  absolute  value  of 
Pearson  correlation  coefficient  is  taken  as  similarity 
system.  When  a  similarity  of  a  pair  of  genes  exceeds  a 
given  threshold,  these  two  genes  are  linked  in  this 
method.

The  most  compatible  reference  graph  of  path-
way  graph

Among  all  possible  values  of  threshold,  single  value  is 
to  be  determined  so  that  the  compatibility  between 
pathway  graph  and  reference  graph  can  be  maximized. 
The  compatibility  between  two  graph  structures  is  de-
signed  to  indicate  the  measurement  by  which  two  graph 
structures  are  similar.  Here  we  will  introduce  the  notion 
of  compatibility  between  two  graphs,  in  the  general  con-
text  of  graph  theory.  The  geodesic  distance d(g, h; G) 
between  nodes g  and h  is  defied  by  the  length  of  short-
est  path  from g  to h  in  the  graph G.  This  distance  rep-

resents  the  global  structure  of  graph  (Chartrand  et al., 
1988).  If  two  graphs G1  and G2  are  constructed  on  the 
same  set  of  nodes,  then  the  geodesic  distance  of  two 
graphs  can  be  easily  defined  by  the  average  of  differ-
ences  of  all  geodesic  distances  of  all  pairs  of  nodes  in 
each  graph,  i.e. 

dist(G1,G2) =

Σ|d(g,h;G1)-d(g,h;G2)|

n(n-1)/2

   

where  the  summation  is  taken  over  all  (unordered)  pairs 
of  nodes  and n  is  the  number  of  common  set  of  nodes. 
We  here  note  that  it  is  symmetric  and  satisfies  triangle 
inequality  (Chartrand  et al.,  1988).  Now  let  GP  be  the 
pathway  graph  and GM  = GM(q)  is  a  (reference)  graph 
constructed  by  microarray  data  with  threshold  q  using 
certain  graph  construction  method.  Then  the  compati-
bility  Comp(GP, GM)  is  obtained  by

Comp(GP, GM) = 1 - dist(GP, GM|GP)/(n-1)

    Here n  is  the  number  of  genes  in GP,  and GM|GP  is 
the  relative  subgraph  of  GM  to  GP.  Since  the  pathway 
graph  GP  contains  only  small  subset  of  genes  that  are 
described  in  graph GM,  it  is  natural  to  compare GP  and 
subgraph  of GM.  It  is  clear  that  the  compatibility  lies  be-
tween  0  and  1  and  it  becomes  1  only  when GM  includes 
exactly  same  suture  of GP.  The  most  compatible  refer-
ence  graph  of GP  is  the  graph GM  which  maximize  the 
compatibility  with  GP.  Simple  greedy  algorithm  is  used 
to  find  such  optimal  threshold  for  each  pathway.  It  is

reference  graphs  can  be  compared  to  it  according  to  different  parameters  ((B),  (C)  and  (D)).  Triangular  tables  represent  geo-
desic  distances  of  gene  pairs  in  pathway  graph  (A)  and  reference  graphs  (B)-(D)  which  are  restricted  to  genes  in  the  pathway,
respectively.  In  this  figure,  (C)  is  determined  to  be  the  most  compatible  reference  graph  of  (A).

worthy  to  note  that  different  optimal  threshold  may  used 
for  extending  different  pathways.
    The  effect  of  threshold  optimization  on  compatibility  is 
illustrated  in  Fig.  2.  When  a  pathway  graph  is  given  in 
(A),  various  reference  graphs  can  be  compared  to  it  ac-
cording  to  different  parameters  ((B),  (C)  and  (D)).  In  this 
figure,  (C)  is  determined  to  be  the  most  compatible  ref-
erence  graph  of  (A).

Scoring  system

With  the  most  compatible  reference  graph  of  a  pathway 
graph,  we  suggest  a  gene  list  supposed  to  be  related 
to  the  given  pathway  by  investigating  scoring  system 
which  is  designed  to  assign  a  higher  score  on  a  gene 
that  is  more  likely  to  be  related  to  the  pathway.  We  in-
vent  scoring  system  based  on  the  idea  of  centrality 
measures  introduced  by  social  network  analysis  (Bogatti 
et al.,  1997).  Social  network  analysis  has  its  strength  in 
reflecting  the  structure  of  a  graph  being  observed, 
though  it  does  not  directly  represent  quantitative  rela-
tions  between  two  nodes.  Because  many  biological  net-
works  are  known  to  work  in  on-off  manner,  we  suggest 
that  social  network  analysis  would  be  a  suitable  method 
to  analyze  biological  networks.  Here  in  this  paper,  we 
make  our  scoring  system  by  adopting  closeness  central-
ity  and  betweenness  centrality  from  social  network  anal-
ysis  (Bogatti et al.,  1997;  Faust,  1997).  The  normalized 
betweenness  centrality  Cbet(g)  and  normalized  close-
ness  centrality  Cclo(g)  of  a  node  g  are  defined  by

Cbet(g) =

    and

Cclo(g) =

n-1

Σd(g,x)
x≠g

    Here n  is  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  graph, path(x, 
y)  is  the  number  of  all  shortest  paths  from x  to y,  and 
path(x, y; g)  is  the  number  of  shortest  paths  from  x 
and y,  which  pass  through g.  In  the  definition  of  close-
ness  centrality,  the  geodesic  distance  d(g, x)  is  used. 
Betweenness  centrality  of  a  node  measures  the  poten-
tial  to  mediate  flows  of  resources  or  information  be-
tween  other  nodes,  and  closeness  centrality  of  a  node 
measures  the  distances  by  efficient  paths  from  the  node 
to  all  the  other  nodes.
    Fig.  3  illustrates  the  different  behaviors  of  the  two 
centrality  measures  in  a  certain  types  of  graphs.  In  (A), 
centrality  of  a  is  expected  to  be  greater  than  that  of  b, 
since  the  node  a  make  connection  of  two  disconnected 
subgraphs,  while  the  node  b  is  related  with  only  single 
subgraph.  Although  both  centralities  of  a  are  greater 
than  those  of  b,  betweenness  centralities  of  a  and  b 
distinguish  their  social  roles  dramatically.  On  the  other 
hand,  in  (B),  closeness  centralities  can  discriminate  the 
social  roles  rather  than  betweenness  centralities.  In  this 
case,  related  nodes  with  c  are  more  central  than  nodes 
related  with  d.  To  assign  a  score S(g)  of  a  gene g,  we 
need  to  construct  a  temporary  graph  which  is  a  sub-
graph  of  the  most  compatible  reference  graph  GM, 
whose  nodes  are  set  of  genes  in  the  pathway  graph GP

seness  scores  discriminates  social 
roles  of  c  and  d  in  (B).

plus  a  gene g.  We  define  two  scoring  systems  by  nor-
malized  betweenness  and  closeness  centrality  measures 
of g  in  the  temporary  graph.  We  call  them  the  between-
ness  scoring  system  and  closeness  scoring  system, 
respectively. 

Results  and  Discussion

Correlation  between  microarray  data  and  path-
way  knowledge

The  basic  assumption  of  PathPlus  is  that  gene  ex-
pression  profile  reflects  pathway  structure  and  pathway 
structure  affects  gene  expression  profile.  We  defined 
two  ‘expressional  homogeneity’  indices,  co-degree  and 
similarity,  between  a  pair  of  genes. 
    Co-degree  between  two  genes  in  a  microarray  gene- 
expression  dataset  is  defined  as  the  number  of  con-
ditions 
in  which  both  are  differentially  expressed. 
Similarity  between  two  genes  is  defined  as  the  absolute 
value  of  the  Pearson  correlation  between  the  two  gene 
profile  vectors.  Two  genes  directly  connected  in  a  path-
way  graph  are  expected  to  have  higher  homogeneity  in-
dices  than  those  non-connected.
    We  further  defined  three  more  measures,  E(P,M)  = 
the  average  of  the  homogeneity  (i.e.  co-degree  or  sim-
ilarity)  indices  of  all  directly  connected  pairs  in  a  path-
way  graph P, N(P,M)  =  the  average  of  the  homogeneity 
(i.e.  co-degree  or  similarity)  indices  of  all  pairs  that  are 

not  directly  connected  in  a  pathway  graph P,  and R(M) 
=  the  average  of  homogeneity  indices  of  all  gene  pairs 
in  a  microarray  dataset  M. 
    If  the  basic  assumption  of  PathPlus  holds,  we  expect 
that  the  inequality E(P,M)  ＞ N(P,M)  ＞ R(M)  should 
be  satisfied.  Fig.  4  demonstrates  the  distributions  of  the 
average  homogeneity  indices  of  directly  connected  and 
non-directly-connected  gene  pairs  for  selected  pathways 
and  those  of  all  gene  pairs  from  the  whole  microarray 
dataset.  Because  it  is  observed  that  the  inequality 
holds,  it  is  suggested  that  microarray  gene-expression 
profile  reflects  biological  pathway  structures  and  vice 
versa.  These  measures  were  only  introduced  to  show 
the  correlation  between  microarray  data  and  pathway 
knowledge.

Performance  evaluation  of  scoring  systems

PathPlus  assigns  a  score  for  each  candidate  gene.  We 
evaluated the reliability of the scoring system. To measure 
the  reliability  of  scoring  system  or  performance  of  model, 
we introduce a performance function, f(k) = M(k)/nㆍ100 
(%),  where M(k)  is  the  number  of  genes  that  included 
in  the  original  pathway  among  top  k  ranked  genes,  and 
n  is  the  number  of  genes  in  the  pathway,  and  k  runs 
from  0  to N,  the  number  of  candidate  genes.  (N=6,153 
in  this  study).

formances  of  actual  pathways,  but  the  lower  part  (E), 
(F),  (G)  and  (H)  represent  performances  of  randomly

tions  of  randomly  constructed  pathways  are  roughly  lo-
cated  on  the  diagonal  lines  connecting  origin  and 
top-right  point  (N, 100).  The  curves  of  actual  perform-
ances  are  located  in  the  upper  triangular  parts  in  gen-
eral,  so  we  expect  that  two  scoring  systems  make  quite 
good  results  of  our  purpose.  Betweenness  scoring  sys-
tems  give  more  stable  performance  with  the  reference 
graph  constructed  by  linking  co-DEGs.  The  reference 
graph  obtained  by  the  method  of  linking  similarly  ex-
pressed  genes  serves  not-so-good  performance  scoring 
systems.  These  poor  results  maybe  related  to  the  sim-
ilarity  system  (the  absolute  value  of  Pearson  correlation 
coefficient)  of  two  genes.  Pearson  correlation  usually  ig-

nores  the  local  similarity,  i.e.,  it  may  assign  low  sim-
ilarity  to  pair  of  genes  which  are  highly  co-expressed 
only  in  the  small  number  of  experimental  conditions. 
The  linking  co-DEGs  methods  overcome  the  locality 
problem  in  some  sense.

Validation  of  the  model  via  extrinsic  information

The  candidate  gene  list  has  been  obtained  by  applying 
our  model  to  each  pathway.  Since  we  have  two  scoring 
systems  and  also  two  methods  to  construct  reference 
graphs,  each  pathway  has  4  lists  of  candidates.  Table 
1  and  2  show  the  top-ranked  genes  with  respect  to  the 
pathways:  "glycolysis  /  gluconegenesis"  and  "TCA  cy-
cle".  These  two  pathways  are  selected  due  to  their  bio-
logical  significances  and  performances.  In  these  tables, 
we  find  that  ranks  of  gene  list  from  different  scoring 
systems  are  quite  compatible  each  other,  but  different 
types  of  constructing  reference  graph  create  incon-
sistent  lists  of  candidates.  Each  table  consists  of  two 
lists  classified  by  its  methods  of  graph  construction,  and 
in  each  part,  sums  of  ranks  (r),  ranks  in  betweenness 
scoring  system  (rb),  ranks  in  closeness  scoring  system 
(rc)  and  grades  are  examined.  The  grades  are  assigned 
by  the  association  with  amiGO  annotation  and  standard 
biological  references.  The  grade  "A"  is  assigned  to

In  the  table,  r  is  for  sums  of  ranks,  rb  for  betweenness  ranks,  rc  for  closeness  ranks.  The  grades  are  assigned  by  the  asso-
ciation  with  amiGO  annotation.  The  grade  “A”  is  for  genes  that  clearly  associated  with  the  pathway,  “B”  is  for  genes  that 
have  equivocal  interpretation,  “C”  is  for  genes  without  association  and  “?”  is  for  genes  with  unknown  functional  annotation.

the  pathway  also  have  been 

genes  that  are  clearly  associated  with  the  pathway,  "B" 
is  genes  with  equivocal  interpretation,  "C"  is  genes  with-
out  association  and  "?"  is  for  the  case  of  unknown  func-
tional  annotation.  All  grade  is  endowed  with  subjectivity.
    Let  us  look  into  the  candidates  for  "glycolysis  /  gluco-
neogenesis"pathway.  A  few  candidates  are  annotated  a 
general  or  vital  cellular  function  or  component  that  we 
cannot  easily  judge  the  relevance  to  the  pathway 
(YFL014W, YML128C, YHR136C, YKL096W and YMR094W). 
A  few  others  are  not  revealed  about  their  functions 
(YBR296C,  YGL117W,  YDL037C,  YGR110W,  YBR147W 
and  YGR035C).  And  some  genes  suggestive  of  strong 
relation  with 
found 
(YFR053C, YML123C, YNL160W and YBR296C). YFR053C 
functions  as  a  hexokinase,  which  is  one  of  the  key  en-
zymes  of  glycolysis  but  has  been  omitted  from  pathway 
graph  because  the  gene  ID  has  not  been  served  by 
KEGG  database  (E.C  2.7.1.1.  in  glycolysis  /  gluconeo-
genesis  pathway  data  from  KEGG  corresponds  to  it). 
YBR296C  and  YML123C  are  genes  whose  products 
function  as  phosphate  transporters-glycolysis  process  is 
intrinsically  linked  with  citric  acid  cycle,  which  is  sub-
sequently  linked  with  oxidative  phosphorylation.  There-
fore  the  extension  of  glycolysis  /  gluconeogenesis  path-
way  toward  oxidative  phosphorylation  via  phosphate 
transporter  can  be  sufficiently  persuasive.
    The  next  candidate  list  is  the  one  for  extension  of  cit-
ric  acid  cycle.  This  pathway  is  historically  well  known, 
and  is  considered  to  be  centrally  located  within  a  meta-
bolic  pathway  network.  (Jeong  et al.,  2001)  Hence  al-
most  every  gene  might  be  traced  to  its  relation  to  citric 
acid  cycle  within  a  few  connections. 
    Nevertheless,  in  the  list  are  some  genes  that  draw  our 
attention  (YLR303W,  YCL040W,  YCL018W,  YOL151W, 
YCL030C,  YDL022W,  YFR053C  and  YJL116C).  YLR303W 
deals  with  serine  metabolism,  which  is  initiated  from  a 
precursor  of  citric  acid  cycle,  3-phosphoglycerate. 
YCL040W  is  a  gene  with  glucokinase  activity  that  is  es-
sential  in  glycolysis/glucokinase  pathway,  which,  as  we 
mentioned  above,  is  closely  lined  with  citric  acid  cycle. 
YJL116C  is  a  gene  for  mitochondrion  organization  and 
biogenesis  and  citric  acid  cycle  occurs  within 
mitochondrion.  YOL151W  is  known  to  have  oxidor-
eductase  activity,  which  is  crucial  for  oxidative  phos-
phorylation-  the  very  next  step  of  citric  acid  cycle  for 
energy  generation.  YDL022W  is  related  to  NAD  activity, 
which  plays  a  key  role  in  citric  acid  cycle.  Similarly,  oth-
ers  participate  in  or  are  related  to  citric  acid  cycle; 
YCL018W  is  related  to  the  cycle  through  malate  met-
albolism,  YCL020C  through  histidine  metabolism  and 
YFR053C  through  fructose  metabolism.

Biological  Pathway  Extension  Using  Microarray  Data    209

Conclusions 

In  this  paper,  we  made  an  attempt  to  extend  an  estab-
lished  pathway  through  microarray  expression  data.  To 
obtain  this  goal,  we  transformed  knowledge  about  path-
ways  and  microarray  expression  data,  respectively,  into 
graph  structures,  and  analyzed  two  graphs  with  a  scor-
ing  system  we  invented  based  on  social  network  theory. 
We  also  validated  the  reliability  of  the  scoring  system  by 
computing  prediction  powers.  Then  final  result  of  candi-
date  lists  has  been  presented  and  has  been  examined 
through  another  source  of  biological  data,  amiGO 
annotation.
