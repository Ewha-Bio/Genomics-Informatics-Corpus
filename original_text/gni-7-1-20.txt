Abstract

Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  is  a  chronic  autoimmune  dis-
order  that  is  characterized  by  inflammation  of  the  syno-
vial  tissue  and  deterioration  of  the  joint  and  bone.  A  re-
cent  study  reported  a  potential  gene-environment  inter-
action  between  HLA-DR  and  smoking.  The  present 
study  investigated  whether  a  specific  gene  was  related 
to  the  association  between  smoking  and  the  severity  of 
RA  (rheumatoid  factor  levels  ＞20  IU/ml).  We  used  the 
resources  of  the  NARAC  family  collection  of  GAW  15 
databases,  and  1139  subjects  with  RF＞20  IU/ml  were 
included  in  the  current  analysis.  The  linkage  panel  con-
tained  5858  SNP  markers,  and  5744  SNPs  passed  qual-
ity  control  criteria.  Linear  regression  analyses,  using 
PLINK  software  and  generalized  estimating  equation  re-
gression  models,  were  used  to  test  for  associations  be-
tween  the  SNPs  and  the  severity  of  RA  according  to 
smoking  groups.  Two  major  findings  were  established. 
First,  the  severity  of  RA  in  smokers  was  associated  with 
rs703618  (p=6×10
of  the  stabilin  2  (STAB2)  gene  on  chromosome  12. 
Second,  there  were  significant  differences  in  the  levels 
of  RF  between  ‘ever  smokers’  and  ‘never  smokers’  ac-
cording  to  the  rs703618  genotype  (G/G,  A/G,  A/A).  We 
investigated  whether  a  specific  gene  acts  as  a  mediator 
between  smoking  and  the  severity  of  RA  and  found  that 
the  STAB2  gene  could  affect  this  relationship.  Our  find-
ing  indicates  that  smoking  may  mediate  RA  severity  by 
affecting  the  expression  level  of  a  specific  gene.

Rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA),  which  is  a  chronic  auto-
immune  disorder  that  is  characterized  by  inflammation 
of  the  synovial  tissue  and  deterioration  of  the  joint  and 
bone,  causes  severe  disability  and  increases  mortality 
(Lee  and  Weinblatt,  2001).
    There  is  substantial  evidence  that  genetic  factors  play 
crucial  roles  in  the  occurrence  of  RA.  The  genes  for 
MHC  class  II,  particularly  the  HLA-linked  genes,  show 
consistent  and  strong  associations  with  the  onset  of  RA 
(Gregersen et al.,  1987;  de  Vries et al.,  2002;  Turesson 
and  Matteson,  2006).  In  addition,  several  environmental 
factors  are  implicated  in  the  development  or  progression 
of  RA  (Klareskog et al.,  2006).  Of  these  factors,  smoking 
is  suspected  to  be  an  important  contributor  to  the  oc-
currence  and  severity  of  RA  (Harrison,  2002;  Alamanos 
and  Drosos,  2005).  Silman  et al.  (1996)  investigated 
smoking-discordant  twin  pairs  with  RA  and  found  that 
smoking  was  associated  with  susceptibility  to  RA. 
Smokers  show  an  increased  incidence  of  RA  and  ele-
vated  levels  of  rheumatoid  factor  (RF)  (Saag et al.,  1997; 
Masdottir  et al.,  2000;  Wolfe,  2000),  which  is  an  in-
dicator  of  RA  severity  (Cabral  et al.,  2005).
    Considering  that  the  occurrence  of  RA  reflects  the  in-
teraction  between  genetic  and  environmental  factors,  an 
approach  to  estimating  such  interactions  would  be  use-
ful  in  the  detection  of  RA  susceptibility  genes.  A  recent 
study  reported  a  potential  gene-environment  interaction 
between  the  shared  epitope  of  HLA-DR  and  smoking.  In 
RF-seropositive  RA,  HLA-DRB1  genotypes  are  asso-
ciated  with  smoking,  which  means  that  a  gene  that  is 
defined  as  a  risk  factor  for  RA  is  strongly  affected  by 
this  environmental  factor  (Padyukov  et al.,  2004).
    We  hypothesized  that  smoking  has  a  significant  effect 
on  the  elevation  of  RA  and  that  this  relationship  is  medi-
ated  by  the  function  of  a  specific  gene.  This  purpose  of 
this  study  was  to  investigate  the  gene-environment  in-
teraction  between  smoking  and  the  severity  of  RA.

Subjects
We  used  the  resources  of  the  15th  Genetic  Analysis 
Workshop  (GAW  15)  database  and  the  North  American 
Rheumatoid  Arthritis  Consortium  (NARAC)  family  collec-

tion.  Families  were  recruited  from  12  NARAC  centers  in 
the  USA  according  to  following  criteria:  1)  at  least  1  sib-
ling  had  documented  erosions  on  hand  radiographs;  and 
2)  at  least  1  sibling  had  disease  onset  between  the  ages 
of  18  and  60  years  (Jawaheer et al.,  2001).  The  dataset 
included  823  families  (92%  Caucasian,  5%  Hispanic, 
2%  African,  0.6%  Asian,  and  0.4%  Native  American) 
with  1966  affected  siblings  with  RA. 
    Age,  sex,  smoking  history,  and  serum  RF  were  eval-
uated  in  the  present  study.  Smoking  histories  were  cate-
gorized  as  ‘Ever  smokers’  or  ‘Never  smokers’  after  RA 
onset,  because  RA  patients  are  more  likely  to  try  to  quit 
smoking,  and  classifying  smokers  based  only  on  current 
smoking  status  may  underestimate  the  effect  of  smok-
ing.  Serum  samples  were  collected  at  study  entry,  and 
RF  IgM  was  measured  using  a  latex-enhanced  nephelo-
metric  procedure.  RF  production  has  been  considered 
the  leading  indicator  of  RA  severity  (Cabral et al.,  2005), 
although  there  is  controversy  due  to  the  detection  of 
healthy  population  and  the  relation  with  age  (Westwood 
et al.,  2006).  In  this  study,  we  defined  the  severity  of  RA 
as  more  than  20  IU/ml  for  RF  levels  (Aigner et al.,  2007). 
Finally,  the  current  analysis  included  1139  subjects  (689 
families)  with  RF＞20  IU/ml.
    Illumina  performed  an  analysis  of  genome-wide  SNPs 
with  commercially  available  SNP  panels  of  all  of  the 
families.  Samples  were  genotyped  using  the  panel  of 
5858  SNPs  across  the  genome,  spaced  at  an  average 
distance  of  0.64  cM  (Illumina  Inc.,  San  Diego  CA,  USA, 
BeadArray  platform  and  GoldenGate  assay).  Nearly  all  of 
these  markers  (98.1%)  passed  quality  control  filters 
(MAF＞5%,  SNP  call  rate＞90%,  and  HWE  p  value＞
0.01),  giving  a  total  yield  of  5744  SNPs.  The  results  of 
the  analysis  of  the  NARAC  Caucasian  families  have 
been  published  (Amos et al.,  2006;  Taylor et al.,  2007). 
Detailed  information  on  the  study  subjects  is  available  at 
the  NARAC  website  (http://www.naracdata.org).

Statistical  analysis 

The  RF  values  were  log-transformed  to  assure  a  normal 
distribution,  and  smoking  habits  were  categorized  into 
‘ever  smoker’  and  ‘never  smoker’  groups.  The  data 
analysis  included  5744  genome-wide  SNPs  (MAF＞5%, 
SNP  call  rate＞90%,  and  HWE  p  value＞0.01)  and  the 
smoking  habits  of  subjects  with  RF  levels  ＞20  IU.  For 
the  groups  that  were  stratified  by  smoking  habits,  fam-
ily-based  tests  of  association  using  PLINK  software 
(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/plink/)  were  per-
formed  with  all  of  the  available  SNPs,  and  generalized 
estimating  equation  (GEE)  regression  models  were  used 
to  test  for  associations  between  the  SNPs  and  the  se-
verity  of  RA  according  to  smoking  groups.  In  the  model, 
the  RF  level  was  used  as  a  response  variable,  and 
SNPs,  age,  and  sex  were  used  as  explanatory  variables. 
    To  show  interaction  between  a  significant  SNP  and 
smoking  status,  we  calculated  the  mean  RF  values  for 
the  3  genotypes  (G/G,  A/G,  A/A)  of  a  significant  SNP 
and  presented  the  least  square  means  (95%  confidence 
intervals)  for  each  allele  after  adjustment  for  age  and 
sex  (Fig.  4),  using  SAS  software  package  version.  9.1

Results

Table  1  lists  the  general  characteristics  of  the  subjects. 
The  mean  age  was  57  years  in  males  and  55  years  in 
females.  Seventy-three  percent  of  males  responded  to 
having  a  smoking  history,  while  52%  of  females  had  a 
smoking  history.  The  mean  RF  value  was  higher  in 
males  (362.9  IU)  than  in  females  (340.6  IU).  RF  (＞20 
IU/ml)  is  log-transformed  (Fig.  1). 
    The  results  from  the  genome-wide  association  analy-
sis  of  RF  are  presented  in  Fig.  2,  and  the  top  4  SNPs 
(p＜10

SNP  in  the  association  between  smoking  and  RF  was 
rs703618  (p=6×10
PubMed  website,  we  confirmed  the  position  and  gene 
name  of  rs703618  (Table  2  and  Fig.  3).
    The  rs703618  SNP  comprises  3  genotypes  (G/G,  A/G, 
A/A),  and  G/G  exists  as  the  minor  allele.  ‘Ever  smokers’ 
with  the  A/A  genotype  had  higher  RF  levels  than  those 
with  the  G/G  genotype.  In  contrast,  the  ‘never  smokers’ 
showed  similar  RF  levels  for  all  3  genotypes.  There  were 
significant  differences  in  the  RF  levels  of  individuals  with 
the  A/A  genotype  between  ‘ever  smokers’  and  ‘never 
smokers,’  while  the  G/G  genotype  was  not  associated 
with  smoking  status  (Table  3).  This  trend  was  retained 
after  adjustment  for  age  and  sex  (Fig.  4).

Discussion

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  investigate  whether 
a  specific  gene  was  related  to  the  association  between 
smoking  and  the  severity  of  RA  (in  patients  with  RF  lev-
els  ＞20  IU/ml).  Two  major  findings  were  established. 
First,  the  severity  of  RA  in  smokers  was  associated  with 
−5),  which  lies  in  the  intronic  region 
rs703618  (p=6×10
of  the  stabilin  2  (STAB2)  gene  on  chromosome  12. 
Second,  there  were  significant  differences  in  the  levels 
of  RF  between  ‘ever  smokers’  and  ‘never  smokers’  ac-
cording  to  the  rs703618  genotype  (G/G,  A/G,  A/A).  The 
RF  levels  were  significantly  increased  in  ‘ever  smokers’

    In  fact,  this  finding  of  the  study,  in  which  we  looked 
at  how  a  specific  gene  mediates  the  relationship  be-
tween  smoking  and  RA  severity,  may  be  a  false  positive 
or  a  pattern  of  linkage  disequilibrium  due  to  the  multiple 
comparison  issue.  Also,  the  statistical  significance  of  our 
result  is  not  strong.  However,  we  found  certain  evidence 
to  support  the  association  due  to  the  robust  methods 
(i.e.,  data  collection,  using  a  powerful  statistical  tool) 
and  biological  plausibility.  The  NARAC  dataset  that  was 
used  in  the  present  analysis  is  reliable  and  stable,  hav-
ing  been  generated  at  12  centers  in  the  USA  with 
well-defined  protocols.  The  data  were  collected  using 
strict  and  consistent  criteria  for  inclusion  and  exclusion, 
and  hand  radiographs  were  used  as  an  entry  criterion  in 
the  NARAC  study  to  ensure  reliability  in  the  diagnosis  of 
RA  and  to  avoid  disease  misclassification  (Jawaheer et 
al.,  2001).  Here,  our  results  were  obtained  from  the 
PLINK  software  package,  which  is  a  powerful  statistical 
tool  for  association  analyses  of  individual  and  fam-
ily-based  data  (Purcell  et al.,  2007).
    Furthermore,  the  rs703618  SNP  (STAB2  gene)  that 
was  observed  in  the  present  study  has  a  biological  role 
that  is  related  to  immune  function.  The  STAB2  gene 
encodes  the  hyaluronan  receptor  for  endocytosis  (HARE), 
which  mediates  hyaluronan  and  chondroitin  sulfate 
clearance  from  the  lymph  and  blood  (Harris et al.,  2004). 
Hyaluronan,  which  is  an  important  component  of  syno-
vial  fluid  and  extracellular  matrix,  is  a  glycosamino-
glycan  polymer  of  repeated  units  of  N-acetylglucos-
amine  and  glucuronic  acid.  Hyaluronan  plays  essential 
roles  in  embryogenesis,  angiogenesis,  cell  proliferation, 
and  wound  healing  (Stern  et al.,  2006;  Kogan  et al., 

Fig.  4.  Mean  RF  values  in  relation  to  the  rs703618  geno-
types  according  to  smoking  history  (error  bars  indicate  95% 
CI).  The  values  are  adjusted  for  age  and  sex.  Smoking  his-
tories  were  categorized  as  ‘Ever  smokers’  or  ‘Never  smok-
ers’  after  RA  onset  (*p＜0.05).

immunosuppressive 

2007).  It  has  been  reported  that  hyaluronan  modulates 
anti-inflammatory  and 
functions 
(Delmage  et al.,  1986;  Bollyky  et al.,  2007).  Bollyky  et 
al.  (2007)  have  suggested  that  high-molecular-weight 
hyaluronan  enhances  the  suppressive  effects  of  CD4＋
CD25＋  regulatory  T  cells,  and  this  may  provide  a  clue 
as  to  the  cellular  immune  response.  RA  patients  show 
elevated  HA  levels  in  their  sera  and  synovial  fluid 

(Engström-Laurent  et al.,  1985;  Goldberg  et al.,  1991; 

Nagaya et al.,  1999;  Majeed et al.,  2004).  Although  the 
role  of  the  STAB2  gene  in  the  relationship  between 
smoking  and  RA  severity  remains  questionable,  smoking 
appears  to  be  related  to  RA  severity  (or  increased  RF 
levels)  in  terms  of  the  impairment  and  abnormality  of 
immune  functions  (Harel-Meir et al.,  2007);  during  these 
processes,  the  STAB2  gene  appears  to  reinforce  the  al-
teration  of  immune  responses.  Thus,  stimulation  of  the 
STAB2  gene  due  to  smoking  may  influence  immune 
function  and  contribute  to  the  severity  of  RA.
    Our  study  has  some  major  limitations.  This  study  was 
a  case-only  design.  This  is  a  good  approach  to  screen 
gene-environment  interactions  with  small  standard  er-
rors,  but  it  is  difficult  to  generalize  results  for  the  gen-
eral  population  due  to  the  case  selection,  and  its  results 
may  be  caused  by  the  linkage  disequilibrium  between 
markers  and  alleles  (Ahn et al.,  2005;  Ahn,  2006).  We  al-
so  restricted  the  analysis  to  a  comparison  of  ‘ever 
smokers’  and  ‘never  smokers’  and  did  not  consider  the 
number  of  packs  of  cigarettes  that  were  smoked  daily. 
Some  studies  have  reported  that  smoking  is  associated 
with  both  the  duration  and  number  of  packs  that  is 
smoked  by  RA  patients  (Stolt et al.,  2003;  Costenbader 

24    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(1)  20-25,  March  2009

et al.,  2006).  However,  because  RA  patients  are  more 
likely  to  try  to  quit  smoking,  and  because  we  consid-
ered  that  smoking  would  have  a  triggering  effect  on  RA 
(Klareskog et al.,  2007),  the  classification  of  ‘ever  smok-
ers’  and  ‘never  smokers’  is  not  likely  to  involve  a  sub-
stantial  bias.  As  mentioned  above,  the  issues  about 
statistical  power  and  multiple  comparisons  appear  to  be 
insufficiently  strong  enough  to  confirm  our  findings.  This 
caveat  must  be  considered  when  interpreting  these 
findings.
    In  conclusion,  we  investigated  whether  a  specific 
gene  acts  as  a  mediator  between  smoking  and  the  se-
verity  of  RA  by  indicating  the  elevation  of  RA  and  found 
that  the STAB2  gene  could  affect  this  relationship.  Our 
finding  indicates  that  smoking  mediates  RA  severity  by 
affecting  the  manifestation  of  a  specific  gene  and  sug-
gests  the  possibility  of  gene-environment  interactions 
between  smoking  and  RA  severity.  Further  studies  are 
required  to  elucidate  the  biological  significance  of  this 
finding.  Furthermore,  it  seems  likely  that  an  under-
standing  of  the  gene-environment  interactions  will  be 
essential  for  the  detection  of  susceptibility  genes  for 
complex  diseases.
