Abstract

Hypertension  is  the  most  prevalent  disease  worldwide 
and  is  itself  a  risk  factor  for  cerebral,  cardiac,  and  renal 
diseases.  The  inconsistency  of  candidate  genes  sug-
gested  by  previous  genomewide  association  studies 
(GWASs)  may  be  due  to  not  only  differences  in  study 
design  and  genetic  or  environmental  background  but  al-
so  the  difference  in  the  power  of  analysis  between  con-
tinuous  traits  and  discrete  traits.  We  analyzed  352,228 
single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  8842  un-
related  Koreans  obtained  from  Ansan  and  Ansung 
cohorts.  We  performed  a  series  of  GWA  analyses  using 
three  different  phenotype  models;  young  hypertensive 
cases  (278  subjects)  versus  elderly  normotensive  con-
trols  (680  subjects);  the  upper  25%  (2211  hypertensive 
cases)  versus  the  lower  25%  of  the  SBP  distribution   
(2211  hypotensive  controls);  and  finally  SBP  and  DBP 
as  continuous  traits  (8842  subjects).  The  numbers  of 
young  hypertensive  cases  and  elderly  normotensive 
controls  were  not  large  enough  to  achieve  genomewide 
significance.  The  model  comparing  the  upper  25%  sub-
jects  to  the  lower  25%  of  subjects  showed  a  power  that 
was  approximate  to  that  of  QTL  analysis.  Two  neighbor-
ing  SNPs  of  the  ATP2B1 gene,  rs17249754  (SBP,  p=

we  did  not  observe  any  gene  variant  attaining  genome-
wide  significance  consistently  in  the  three  phenotype 
models  except  for  the ATP2B1  gene  variants.  In  general, 
the  association  signal  with  blood  pressure  was  stronger 
in  women  than  in  men.  Genes  identified  in  GWASs  are 
expected  to  open  the  way  for  prevention,  early  diag-
nosis,  and  personalized  treatment  of  hypertension.

Introduction
Nearly  one  billion  people  (−26%)  of  the  adult  pop-

(KNHANES 

Examination  Survey 

ulation  worldwide  have  hypertension  (Kearney  et al. 
2005).  According  to  the  Korean  National  Health  and 
Nutrition 
2008, 
http://knhanes.  cdc.go.kr/),  the  prevalence  of  hyper-
tension  is  26.9%  among  Korean  adults  aged  above  30 
years.  Clinically,  the  diagnosis  of  hypertension  is  given 
when  the  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and  diastolic 
blood  pressure  (DB)  are  above  140/90  mm  Hg  in  the 
resting  position.  About  90%  to  95%  of  cases  are  pri-
mary  (essential)  hypertension,  which  refers  to  high  blood 
pressure  that  is  not  caused  by  any  other  disorders 
(Carretero  and  Oparil,  2000).

Hypertension  is  one  of  risk  factors  for  cerebral,  car-
diac,  and  renal  diseases  (Pierdomenico et al.,  2009).  On 
the  other  hand,  essential  hypertension  usually  occurs 
with  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  such  as  aging,  obesity, 
type  2  diabetes  (T2DM),  and  hormone  disorders.  Lifestyle 
factors  that  are  known  to  cause  hypertension  include 
sedentary  lifestyle,  high  stress,  high  salt  intake,  and  al-
cohol  consumption  (Kyrou  et al.,  2006).  Both  blood 
pressure  and  hypertension  are  traditional  examples  of 
complex  traits  controlled  by  the  complex  interplay  of 
genes  and  environmental  factors  (Pickering et al.,  1959). 
The  heritability  of  blood  pressure  ranges  from  31%  to 
68%,  depending  on  studies  based  on  different  measure-
ments  of  SBP  and  DBP  (Pilia et al.,  2006;  Tobin et al., 
2005).

Ehret  (2010)  summarized  the  12  genomewide  associa-
tion  studies  (GWASs)  on  blood  pressure  and  hyper-

tension  that  were  recently  published.  While  10-20  loci 
were identified in previous GWASs, only two (i.e. CYP17A1, 
MTHFR)  genes  were  reproducibly  associated  with  blood 
pressure  or  essential  hypertension  in  large  cohorts. 
Ehret  (2010)  pointed  out  the  possibility  that  the  differ-
ences  in  significant  SNPs  that  were  identified  among 
these  12  GWASs  may  be  due  to  the  difference  in  power 
of  analysis  between  continuous  traits  and  discrete  traits. 
A  continuous  trait  provides  more  variation  than  a  dis-
crete  trait;  thus,  continuous  trait  locus  (QTL)  analysis  is 
considered  to  be  more  powerful  than  discrete  trait  anal-
ysis  (e.g.,  case-control  analysis)  (Potkin  et al.,  2009). 
However,  means  of  SBPs  and  DBPs  measured  in  a  gen-
eral  population  (i.e.,  a  cohort)  may  not  be  representative 
of  the  true  means  in  the  population,  since  most  hyper-
tensive  patients  have  taken  antihypertensive  drugs  to 
lower  their  blood  pressure.  On  the  other  hand,  compar-
ing  extreme  discordant  phenotypes,  such  as  individuals 
at  the  lowest  end  versus  individuals  at  the  highest  end 
of  the  blood  pressure  spectrum,  may  be  a  powerful  ap-
proach  in  GWASs  (Nebert,  2000).

In  this  study,  we  have  compared  the  gene  variants 
associated  with  quantitative  blood  pressures  (SBP  and 
DBP)  with  those  identified  in  GWASs  using  different  def-
initions  of  discrete  phenotypes  to  present  an  alternative 
strategy  that  has  increased  statistical  power  over  a 
case-control  study  in  the  context  of  a  GWAS  for  hyper-
tension.

Methods

Study  samples  and  genotype  data

The  study  subjects  were  obtained  from  the  two  com-
munity  cohorts,  Ansung  and  Ansan,  which  were  estab-
lished  in  a  rural  area  and  an  urban,  respectively,  in 
South  Korea,  as  part  of  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemio-
logy  Study  (KoGES),  launched  in  2001.  The  Korea

Association  Resource  (KARE)  project  was  initiated  in 
2007,  and  a  total  of  10,038  unrelated  Koreans  were 
genotyped  with  the  Affymetrix  Genomewide  Human  SNP 
array  5.0  (Affymetrix  Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  After 
exclusion  of  inadequate  samples  with  high  genotype 
missing  rate,  high  heterozygosity,  gender  inconsistencies, 
cancer,  and  high  identity-by-state  (＞0.8),  a  total  of 
8842  individuals  aged  40  to  69  years  were  included  in 
the  subsequent  analyses.  We  analyzed  352,228  single 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  markers  after  excluding 
29.6%  of  the  500K  SNPs  with  low  genotype  quality  (i.e.,

Statistical  analysis

We  calculated  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  (SD)  for 
the  continuous  variables  and  counted  the  number  and 
frequencies  for  discrete  variables  by  gender  to  describe 
the  baseline  characteristics  of  study  subjects  using  the 
STATA  software  package,  v11  (Stata  Corp,  College  sta-
tion,  Texas,  USA).  We  drew  box  plots  of  systolic  (SBP) 
and  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  by  gender  and  three 
age  groups  (39-49,  50-59,  and  60-70)  using  R  program, 
v2.9.1  (http://www.r-project.org).

Three  phenotype  models  were  used:  first,  we  com-
pared  the  younger  age  group  of  39-49  years  with  high 
SBP  (≥140  mm  Hg)  and  the  elderly  age  group  of  60-70 
years  with  low  SBP  (＜120  mm  Hg);  second,  we  per-
formed  a  GWAS  by  comparing  the  upper  25%  and  low-
er  25%  of  the  SBP  distribution;  and  finally,  we  per-
formed  QTL  analyses  on  SBP  and  DBP.  We  used  PLINK 
v1.06  to  estimate  MAF,  to  test  for  deviations  from  HWE, 
and  to  conduct  single-marker  genomewide  association 
tests  (Purcell et al.,  2007).  While  we  tested  discrete  phe-

notypes  in  multiple  logistic  regression  analyses,  we  car-
ried  out  multiple  linear  regression  analyses  between 
352,228  SNP  markers  with  SBP  and  DBP  using  models 
with  adjustments  for  age,  sex,  place  of  residence,  and 
BMI  under  an  additive  genetic  model.  Further  analyses 
were  performed  after  stratification  of  gender  with  adjust-
ments  for  age,  place  of  residence,  and  BMI.  We  sum-
marized  the  GWAS  results  with  the  integration  of  PLINK 
output  and  annotation  data  using  Python  v2.6.2  (http:// 
python.org).  We  present  the  Manhattan  plots  of  the 
GWAS  results,  which  were  drawn  using  R  v.2.9.1.

Results

As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  study  subjects  were  com-
posed  of  4183  men  (47.3%)  and  4659  women  (52.7%) 

with  a  mean  age  of  52  and  53  years,  respectively. 
Among  7287  individuals  who  answered  the  question  on 
medication  use,  10.3%  of  men  and  14.8%  of  women 
answered  that  they  had  taken  antihypertensive  drugs. 
The  mean  SBP  and  mean  DBP  among  men  (122/82  mm 
Hg)  were  slightly  higher  than  those  of  women  (121/79 
mm  Hg).

The  box  plots  present  the  distributions  of  SBP  and 
DBP  by  gender  and  age  (Fig.  1).  Blood  pressure  tended 
to  increase  with  age,  especially  in  the  case  of  SBP.  The 
upper  25%  and  lower  25%  of  the  SBP  distribution  in 
men,  women,  and  all  subjects  were  110/132,  107/133, 
and  109/132  mm  Hg,  respectively.  The  corresponding 
values  of  DBP  were  74/89,  70/87,  and  72/88  mm  Hg, 
respectively.  While  the  distribution  of  DBP  was  approx-
imately  normal,  the  distribution  of  SBP  was  slightly

skewed  to  the  right.  Since  most  previous  GWASs  on 
SBP  were  conducted  without  any  transformation,  we 
performed  a  GWAS  using  the  untransformed  SBP  re-
sponse  variable  for  comparability  with  the  previous 
reports.

Initially,  we  compared  the  GWAS  results  obtained  by 
using  three  different  phenotype  definitions  for  SBP 
(Table  2).  Although  we  compared  comparably  young  hy-
pertensive  cases  (SBP≥140  mm  Hg)  with  elderly  nor-
motensive  controls  (SBP＜120  mm  Hg)  to  increase  the 
statistical  power,  the  numbers  of  cases  and  controls 
were  not  sufficiently  large  enough  to  achieve  a  genome-
wide  level  of  significance.  Fig.  2  shows  two  SNPs  that 
exceeded  the  genomewide  threshold  in  the  QTL  analysis 
as  well  as  in  the  discrete  trait  analysis,  comparing  the 

upper  25%  of  individuals  with  hypertension  with  the 
lower  25%  of  individuals  with  hypotension.  As  expected, 
the  strongest  evidence  for  association  was  observed  in 
the  QTL  analysis,  due  to  not  only  the  higher  power  of 
the  QTL  analysis  over  discrete  analysis  but  also  the 
largest  pool  of  subjects  being  analyzed  in  this  QTL 
analysis.  While  the  estimate  of  the  effect  of  this  SNP 
was  in  the  same  direction  for  both  genders,  the  associ-
ation  signal  was  stronger  in  women  than  in  men.

In  Table  3,  we  show  the  candidate  genes  correspond-
ing  to  the  top  9  SNPs  identified  from  the  three  GWAS 
models  using  different  definitions  for  SBP.  Two  SNPs, 
rs17249754  and  rs7136259,  located  approximately  10 
kb and 31 kb from the 5’ end of the ATPase, Ca++ tran-
sporting,  plasma  membrane  1  (ATP2B1)  gene,  passed

the  Bonferroni  correction  in  the  model  for  SBP  as  a  QT 
and  the  model-namely,  25%  High  versus  25%  Low 
SBP.  However,  we  did  not  observe  any  gene  identified 
consistently  in  the  three  GWA  analyses,  except  these 
two  SNPs,  which  achieved  the  Bonferroni  level  of 
significance.  Among  the  top-ranking  SNPs  observed  in 
the  analysis  of  young  hypertensive  cases  and  elderly 
normotensive  controls,  six  SNPs  were  located  in  the  in-
trons  of  the  gamma-aminobutyric  acid  (GABA)  A  re-
ceptor,  beta  1  (GABRB1)  gene.  In  the  25%  High  versus 
25%  Low  SBP  GWAS,  rs3764795  was  located  in  an 
exon  of  glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored  mole-
cule-like  protein  (GML,  8q24.3);  this  SNP  is  a  missense 
mutation  that  causes  an  Arg-to-Cys  substitution.

We  have  provided  more  detailed  information  on  the 
three  SNPs  that  passed  the  Bonferroni  correction  in  the 
GWAS  for  SBP  and  DBP  in  Table  4.  The  mean  differ-
ences  and  95%  confidence  intervals  (95%  CI)  that  were 

estimated  in  men,  women,  and  both  genders,  re-
spectively,  are  shown  in  this  table.  While  the  two  SNPs 
of  the ATP2B1  gene  showed  a  stronger  effect  in  wom-
en,  rs11066280,  which  is  25.2  kb  downstream  of  the  ri-
bosomal  protein  L6  (RPL6)  gene,  showed  a  significant 
genomewide  association  in  men  only.  The  association  of 
ATP2B1  with  SBP  was  stronger  than  that  with  DBP. 
Interestingly,  four  SNPs  that  are  92.4  kb  upstream  of 
the  mannosidase,  alpha,  class  2A,  member  1  (MAN2A1) 
gene  showed  strong  evidence  for  an  association  with 
DBP  in  elderly  men  only  (e.g.  rs6421827,  p=4.86×10
(data  not  shown).

Conclusion

Quantitative  phenotype  is  inherently  different  from  a 
case-control  study.  The  use  of  QTs  as  phenotypes  in-
crease  the  statistical  power  over  categorical  association

approaches  in  the  context  of  a  GWAS  of  hypertension. 
In  contrast  to  a  case-control  analysis,  a  QT  analysis  has 
considerably  greater  power.  A  QT  analysis  can  identify 
the  same  risk  genes  found  in  a  typical  case-control 
study  or  an  entirely  different  set  of  genes  because  of 
the  specificity  of  the  phenotype  definition.

In  this  study,  we  compared  the  gene  variants  asso-
ciated  with  quantitative  blood  pressure  (SBP  and  DBP) 
with  those  identified  in  GWASs  using  different  definitions 
of  discrete  phenotype.  The  numbers  of  young  hyper-
tensive  cases  and  elderly  normotensive  controls  were 
not  large  enough  to  achieve  genomewide  significance. 
The  model  comparing  the  upper  25%  to  the  lower  25% 
of  subjects  showed  a  power  that  was  approximate  to 
that of the QTL analysis. Two neighboring SNPs, rs17249754 
and  rs7136259  of  the  ATP2B1  gene,  were  associated 
with  both  SBP  and  DBP.  Interestingly,  an  SNP  of  the 
RPL6  gene,  rs11066280,  revealed  a  significant  genome-
wide  association  with  SBP  in  men  only,  and  four  SNPs, 
located  near  the MAN2A1  gene,  showed  a  strong  asso-
ciation  with  DBP  in  elderly  men  aged  60-70  years  only. 
However,  we  did  not  observe  any  gene  variant  that  at-
tained  genomewide  significance  consistently  in  the  three 
phenotypic  models,  except  for  the ATP2B1  gene  variants.
So  far,  10-20  loci  have  been  proposed  as  candidate 
genes  for  hypertension.  However,  only  two  genes  re-
ported  in  previous  studies  were  replicated  in  the  12  re-
cently  published  GWASs  (Ehret,  2010).  Previously,  we 
reported  the  association  of ATP2B1  with  SBP  and  DBP 
using  the  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  data  ob-
tained  from  two  Korean  community-based  populations 
(Cho  et al.,  2009).  Among  the  genes  reported  in  pre-
vious  studies,  two  genes,  SRC 
(also  called  CSK, 
rs1378942,  15q24.1)  and ATP2B1  (12q21.33),  were  also 
identified  in  the  current  study.  The  association  between 
the  SRC  gene  and  DBP  was  shown  in  the  Global  BP 
(Newton-Cheh  et  al.,  2009),  and  the 
Gene  Study 
ATP2B1  gene  was  associated  with  SBP  and  DBP,  as 
well  as  hypertension,  in  the  CHARGE  study  (Levy et al., 

2009).  ATP2B1  plays  a  critical  role  in  intracellular  cal-
cium  homeostasis  (Ehret,  2010);  thus,  it  is  biologically 
plausible  that  the  gene  variants  are  involved  in  blood 
pressure  control.

Previous  studies  analyzed  the  KARE  data  to  replicate 
the  association  of  six  SNPs  with  essential  hypertension, 
reported  by  the  Wellcome  Trust  GWAS,  and  to  identify 
nonsynonymous  SNPs  associated  with  BP  and  hyper-
tension  through  the  analysis  of  1180  nsSNPs  that  are 
included  in  the  Affymerix  SNP  Array  5.0.  A  total  of  7551 
individuals  were  analyzed  after  excluding  antihypertensive 
therapy  from  the  SBP  and  DBP  GWAS.  Such  variables 
as  age,  sex,  area,  and  BMI  were  controlled  in  their  QTL 
analyses.  However,  none  of  the  SNPs  was  replicated  in 
the  Korean  population  at  the  genomewide  significance 
level  in  these  analyses  (Hong  et al.,  2009;  2010a). 
Recently,  Hong et al.  identified  10  SNPs  associated  with 
blood  pressure  and  hypertension  risk  using  the  KARE 
data,  composed  of  8842  individuals,  and  replicated 
three  SNPs-17249754  of  the  ATP2B1  gene,  rs1378942 
in  the CSK  gene,  and  rs12945290  in  the  ARSG  gene-in 
the  Health2  data  on  7861  subjects  (Hong et al.,  2010b). 
In  the  current  study,  we  did  not  exclude  1056  in-
dividuals  who  had  taken  antihypertensive  drugs.  The  pa-
tients  who  were  currently  taking  antihypertensive  drugs 
might  reduce  their  BP,  and  therefore,  the  strength  of  as-
sociation  might  be  diluted  and  the  statistical  power 
might  decrease  when  these  individuals  are  included  in 
the  QTL  analysis.  This  means  that  including  individuals 
who  are  taking  antihypertensive  drugs  increases  the 
false  negative  rate  instead  of  increasing  the  false  pos-
itive  association.  It  may  be  a  reason  for  the  incon-
sistency  of  the  results  of  the  current  study  and  those  of 
Hong  et al.  The  GWASs  on  blood  pressure  have  pro-
vided  valuable  insights  into  the  underlying  genetic  archi-
tecture  of  essential  hypertension.  However,  much  work 
remains  to  be  done  in  understanding  the  functional  and 
pathophysiological  properties  of  the  gene  variants  that 
were  identified  in  the  previous  GWASs.  Future  studies 

114    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(3)  108-115,  September  2010

on  rare  variants  with  intermediate  or  large  effect  on  BP 
might  facilitate  the  investigation  of  heritability  of  BP.  The 
genes  that  have  been  identified  in  GWASs  are  expected 
to  open  the  way  for  the  prevention,  early  diagnosis,  and 
personalized  treatment  of  hypertension.
