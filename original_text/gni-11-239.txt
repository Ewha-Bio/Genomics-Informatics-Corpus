Somatic mutation is a major cause of cancer progression and varied responses of tumors against anticancer agents. Thus, we 
must obtain and characterize genome-wide mutational profiles in individual cancer subtypes. The Cancer Genome Atlas 
database includes large amounts of sequencing and omics data generated from diverse human cancer tissues. In the present 

study, we integrated and analyzed the exome sequencing data from ∼3,000 tissue samples and summarized the major 
genes) with low frequency from an analysis of 11 major cancer subtypes. The majority of tissue samples harbored 20‒80 

mutant genes in each of the diverse cancer subtypes and stages. Mutations were observed in most human genes (~23,000 

different mutant genes, on average. Lung cancer samples showed a greater number of mutations in diverse genes than other 
cancer subtypes. Only a few genes were mutated with over 5% frequency in tissue samples. Interestingly, mutation frequency 
was  generally  similar  between  non-metastatic  and  metastastic  samples  in  most  cancer  subtypes.  Among  the  12  major 
mutations, the TP53, USH2A, TTN, and MUC16 genes were found to be frequent in most cancer types, while BRAF, FRG1B, 
PBRM1, and VHL showed lineage-specific mutation patterns. The present study provides a useful resource to understand the 
broad spectrum of mutation frequencies in various cancer types.

Introduction

Recent progress in high-throughput sequencing techno-
logy  has  contributed  to  the  generation  of  genome-wide 
somatic mutation profiles in diverse cancer samples. The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of largest collaborative 
efforts to generate multi-level omics data on human cancer 
tissue  samples.  Particularly,  information  on  genome-wide 
somatic mutations has been collectively profiled from exome 
sequencing data from thousands of patients’ tumor samples. 
Somatic mutation is a main driving force for cancer deve-
lopment and progression. Thus, many researchers have tried 
to complete the catalog of somatic mutations in cancer cell 
lines [1, 2]. Somatic mutation is also known to be involved 
in  key  mechanisms  for  cellular  sensitivity  or  resistance 
against chemotherapy [3-5].

In  our  previous  study  using  cancer  cell  line  data,  we 
reported  that  somatic  mutation  was  a  more  significant 
classifier  than  cancer  lineage  in  predicting  the  anticancer 
drug  response  [6].  Thus,  we  identified  many  unknown 
association  patterns  between  cancer  drug  response  and 

mutational genotypes in cancer cell lines－e.g., MYC-amp 
mutation-specific sensitivity of insulin-like growth factor 1 
receptor inhibitors. In addition, mutation information pro-
vided important clues for us to better interpret the biological 
relevance of molecular signatures identified from the tran-
scriptome and proteome data of diverse cancer cell lines. The 
next step should be to find out the clinical application of 
mutation-specific  drug  responses  or  molecular  signatures 
obtained from cell line-based analysis.

Thus, it is important to systematically analyze the mu-
tational  genotype  (mutaome)  of  various  human  tissue 
samples and identify mutations significantly associated with 
specific types of tumors. ‘Mutaome’ means the cancer mu-
tational landscape, including mutations in oncogenes and 
tumor suppressors. In the present study, we organized all 
sequence-based mutation information into gene-based fre-
quency data. Then, we comparatively determined the major 
genes of somatic mutations in diverse cancer subtypes and 
cancer stages (i.e., non-metastatic and metastatic samples). 
This work will provide practical information for directing in 
vitro cell line-based mutation-specific phenotypes to clinical

Methods
Data acquisition

Somatic  mutation  data  for  tumor  tissue  samples  from 
2938  patients,  harboring  11  cancer  types,  were  obtained 
from the data portal of TCGA, which were freely available. 
These  data  (level  2)  for  10  cancer  types,  except  ovarian 
serous  cy_stadenocarcinoma  (OV),  provide  genome-wide 
somatic mutations on each sample experimented with the 
Illumina Genome Analyzer DNA Sequencing platform (Illu-
mina, San Diego, CA, USA). The somatic mutation data for 
OV  were  organized,  combined  with  data  produced  from 
Illumina  and  the  ABI  SOLiD  DNA  System  Sequencing 
platforms (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The 
details,  including  the  full  name  of  each  cancer  type  and 
updated dates of mutation data, are provided in Table 1. 

Together  with  somatic  mutation  data,  clinical  data  for 
each patient were downloaded from the data portal of TCGA. 
These data were applied to categorize samples into meta-
stasis and non-metastasis. The annotation of ‘pathologic_M’ 
was  available  to  indicate  the  stage  of  metastasis  in  the 
patient’s tumor samples. The stage of M0’ means that there 
was no evidence of distant metastasis, and ‘M1’ means that 
a pathological distant metastasis was found. In this study, 
the samples from patients annotated as ‘M0’ were classified 
as non-metastatic, and those with ‘M1’ were classified as 
metastatic. 

Analysis of somatic mutations

The number of detected mutations in each cancer type 

ranged from tens to hundreds of thousands. We organized 
the detected point mutations into 23,050 human genes. The 
number of mutant genes per sample was counted for ~3,000 
samples.  In  addition,  the  mutation  frequency  and  its 
percentage were calculated for all samples and each cancer 
type. The major mutant genes that ranked within the top 3 in 
each  cancer  type  were  selected  based  on  the  observed 
frequency  in  the  overall,  non-metastatic,  and  metastatic 
samples.

The patterns of frequency for the selected major genes 
were analyzed through hierarchical clustering method. The 
clustering and its visualization on a heatmap were performed 
using  the  software  QCanvas  [7].  QCanvas  can  be  down-
loaded  freely  from  the  website  http://compbio.sook-
myung.ac.kr/~qcanvas. 

Results and Discussion
Mutation frequency in patients’ tumor samples

From the TCGA database, thousands of patients’ tumor 
samples  were  analyzed  to  detect  variants  in  the  whole 
genome. To quantify the genome-wide mutation profile in 
diverse tumors, we organized the whole mutant genes into 
several cancer types and stages, using the annotation infor-
mation  obtained  from  TCGA.  Overall,  a  total  of  871,684 
mutations were virtually found in 23,050 human genes from 
2,938 patient tumor samples (Table 1). Samples covered 11 
diverse cancer types (Table 1). These data were continuously 
updated  and  produced  by  analyzing  additional  samples. 
Together with the extended production of multi-level omics 
data using the same patients’ tissue samples, TCGA provides 
a useful resource for understanding the role of mutations in 
cancer progression.

The distribution of mutant genes on each sample showed 
that  a  variety  of  genes  are  mutated  in  individual  tumor 
samples. Most samples contained on average 20‒80 muta-
tions (Fig. 1A). This means that each single tumor sample 
has  mutations  in  multiple  genes.  Various  mutations  in  a 
cancer  sample  were  already  well-characterized  and  cons-
tructed  as  open  source  data  [8],  and  the  significance  of 
multiple mutations in a single tumor has been constantly 
suggested [9, 10]. It is appropriate that a tumor may also 
consist of a heterogeneous collection of cells with different 
types of mutations. Furthermore, in the aspect of lineage 
dependency, the amount of mutations in individual samples 
varied,  depending  on  cancer  type  (Fig.  1C).  Lung  adeno-
carcinoma samples have a wide range of mutation frequen-
cies in individual samples and harbor more mutations than 
other lineages. The broad range of mutation frequencies in 
lung cancer was also referred to in Lawrence et al. [11]. In 
contrast, thyroid carcinoma has relatively few mutations in 
individual samples. Further studies are required to under-
stand the association with the amounts of mutations and 
major  biological  factors  in  each  cancer  type.  This  can  be 
analyzed  by  comparing  with  the  patient’s  clinical  infor-
mation, including smoking. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  mutation  of  each  gene  was 
observed at a very low frequency in all samples (Fig. 1B). 
Most genes contained mutations in less than 1% of samples, 
and only a few genes contained mutations in over 5% of all 
samples.  Generally,  the  mutation  of  a  gene  showed  low

other lineages), and sometimes, a gene showed a mutation 
in ＞8% of UCEC tumors. In conclusion, there are only a few 
genes in which mutations are frequently (i.e., ＞1-2%) found 
in  tumor.  Genes  with  relatively  frequent  mutations  in 
tumors may have a significant role in cancer progression. 

Comparative analysis of mutations between 
non-metastatic and metastatic samples 

TCGA provides annotations for the stage of metastasis in 
each  patient  sample  from  the  clinical  data.  According  to 
these data, thousands of samples for 8 cancer types, except 
for OV, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and UCEC, were 
classified  into  89  metastatic  and  1341  non-metastatic 
samples in order to compare the mutation frequency bet-
ween them. The annotation for metastasis was not provided 
for the excluded cancer types－OV, GBM, and UCEC. Intere-
stingly, metastatic samples had similar mutation frequencies 
as non-metastatic samples for most cancer types (Fig. 2). 
Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) had significant (p 
＜ 0.01)  difference  in  frequency  between  metastatic  and 
non-metastatic samples. This result implied that there is no 
differential occurrence of mutations between metastatic and 
non-metastatic samples, except in minor case.

Identification of major mutant genes

In this study, the mutation frequency was analyzed se-
parately in overall, non-metastatic, and metastatic samples. 
We focused on mutant genes exhibiting high frequency in 
each sample group. A total of 12, 10, and 15 genes were 
ranked within the top 3 mutations in at least one of cancer 
type in the overall, non-metastatic, and metastatic samples, 
respectively  (Table  2).  Especially,  TP53  and  TTN  showed 
dominant frequencies for over 1,000 of all samples. 

In  addition,  the  pattern  of  mutation  frequency  for  the 
selected major mutant genes was analyzed in diverse cancer 
categories  (Fig.  3).  Regardless  of  sample  group,  MUC16, 
TTN, and TP53 were found to be frequent in most cancer 
types. TP53 is a well-known mutant gene, playing an im-
portant role in cancer progression [12, 13]. It was reported 
that TP53 mutation is frequently represented in major cancer 
lineages  [6].  Mutation  TTN  and  MUC16  has  not  been 
reported to be critical in cancers. This analysis shows that 
they may have potential, specific roles in cancer develop-
ment or progression.

Among 12 major mutant genes selected from the overall 
samples, BRAF, FRG1B, PBRM1, and VHL had cancer sub-
type-specific mutation patterns (Fig. 3A). Especially, PBRM1

and  VHL  showed  strong  specificity  in  KIRC  tumors.  As 
previously reported [14], the alterations of VHL (a tumor 
suppressor gene) are clearly dominant in renal cell carci-
noma. Together with VHL, PBRM1 was identified as a major 
gene,  frequently  mutated  in  renal  carcinoma  [15].  An 
association  with  the  loss  of  its  expression  and  renal  cell 
carcinoma  progression  was  suggested in  previous studies 
[16]. 

are required for other major metastasis-associated mutant 
genes. In conclusion, the diversity of major mutant genes in 
metastatic  samples  is  quite  different  from  those  in  non- 
metastatic tumors, although the overall mutation frequency 
is similar between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. 
The  present  study  provides  a  useful  resource 
for 
understanding the varied frequency of diverse mutations in 
patients’ tumor samples. 

Mutant genes dependent on metastasis

We  found  that  there  was  no  difference  in  the  overall 
frequency of metastatic and non-metastatic samples (Fig. 2). 
The  nine  mutant  genes  found  in  non-metastatic  samples 
were all included in the major mutant genes in the overall 
samples (Fig. 3B). The lineage-dependent frequency in non- 
metastatic samples was also similar with the overall pattern 
in Fig. 3A. However, half of the 15 major mutant genes from 
metastatic samples were different from the mutant genes in 
non-metastatic or overall samples (Fig. 3C). The mutations 
of FAM182B, LOC653544, PLEC, STAG2, PTPRT, CSMD3, and 
LRP1B represented unique frequencies in metastatic sam-
ples. Especially, PTPRT is a member of the protein tyrosine 
phosphatase (PTP) family. The deletion of PTPRD, included 
in  the  same  PTP  family,  is  frequently  seen  in  metastatic 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [17]. Further studies
