Abstract

Heat  shock  proteins  are  a  class  of  molecular  chaper-
ones  that  can  be  found  in  nearly  all  organisms  from 
Bacteria,  Archaea  and  Eukarya  domains.  Heat  shock 
proteins  experience  increased  transcription  during  peri-
ods  of  heat  induced  osmotic  stress  and  are  involved  in 
protein  disaggregation  and  refolding  as  part  of  a  cell’s 
danger  signaling  cascade.  Heat  shock  protein,  Hsp20  is 
a  small  molecular  chaperone  that  is  approximately 
20kDa  in  weight  and  is  hypothesized  to  prevent  ag-
gregation  and  denaturation.  Hsp20  can  be  found  in  sev-
eral  strains  of  Proteobacteria,  which  comprises  the  larg-
est  phyla  of  the  Bacteria  domain  and  also  contains  sev-
eral  medically  significant  bacterial  strains.  Genomic 
analyses  were  performed  to  determine  a  common  evolu-
tionary  pattern  among  Hsp20  sequences  in  Proteobac-
teria.  It  was  found  that  Hsp20  shared  a  common  ances-
tor  within  and  among  the  five  subclasses  of  Proteo-
bacteria.  This  is  readily  apparent  from  the  amount  of  se-
quence  similarities  within  and  between  Hsp20  protein 
sequences  as  well  as  phylogenetic  analysis  of  se-
quences  from  proteobacterial  and  non-proteobacterial 
species.

Introduction

Heat  shock  proteins  are  part  of  a  cellular  defensive  sys-
tem  that  is  of  extreme  importance  and  can  be  found  in 
nearly  all  living  organisms.  In  1974  the  first  heat  shock 
protein  was  reported  for  Drosophila melanogaster,  the 
universality  of  these  proteins  became  a  realization  soon 
afterward  when  they  were  discovered  in  organisms 
ranging  from  humans  to  bacteria  (Schleisinger,  1990). 
The  role  of  heat  shock  proteins  is  to  protect  native  pro-
teins  from  misfolding  and  aggregating  under  heat  in-

duced  or  osmotic  stress  (Oganesyan et al.,  2007).  They 
comprise  a  group  of  several  proteins  in  which  tran-
scription  is  increased  when  cells  are  exposed  to  heat  in-
duced  or  osmotic  stress  by  heat  shock  factor  as  part  of 
the  heat  shock  response  (Schleisinger,  1990;  Suzuki  et 
al,  1998;  Trotter et al.,  2002;  Davies et al.,  2006;  Oga-
nesyan et al.,  2007).  The  heat  shock  response  prompts 
the  cell  danger  signaling  cascade,  in  which  heat  shock 
proteins  refold  and  de-aggregate  proteins  that  have  be-
come  damaged  in  the  cell  (Davies et al.,  2006).  In  addi-
tion,  heat  shock  proteins  are  found  as  both  intracellular 
and  extracellular  proteins  that  participate  in  the  immune 
response  (Davies et al.,  2006).  Heat  shock  proteins  are 
also  expressed  under  normal  conditions  as  molecular 
chaperones,  to  assist  in  protein  folding  and  maintenance 
of  protein  integrity  (Davies  et al.,  2006;  Oganesyan  et 
al.,  2007).  Heat  shock  protein  Hsp20,  is  a  family  of 
small  heat  shock  proteins  that  are  approximately  20kDa 
in  weight  and  identified  by  a  conserved  C  terminal  do-
main  of  about  100  residues  (Kim et al.,  1998).  It  is  hy-
pothesized  that  Hsp20  proteins  form  large  hetero-
oligomeric  aggregates  that  protect  other  proteins  against 
aggregation  and  denaturation  (Mulder  et  al.,  2007). 
Hsp20  was  first  discovered  in  human  skeletal  muscle 
and  has  been  found  to  be  expressed  in  cardiac  muscle, 
stomach,  intestine  and  bladder  (Rembold  et al.,  2000; 
Meeks  et al.,  2005;  Mulder  et al.,  2007). 
    The  phylum  Proteobacteria  is  no  exception  in  the 
sense  that  it  too  posses  heat  shock  proteins.  It  is  one 
of  the  largest  phyla  of  the  Bacteria  domain  and  is  fur-
ther  subdivided  into  five  categories:  alpha,  beta,  delta, 
epsilon  and  gamma  The  alpha,  beta  and  gamma  sub-
classes  were  highly  supported  by  morphological  analy-
ses,  however,  the  delta  and  epsilon  subclasses  were 
added  separately  and  are  considered  to  have  separated 
earlier  than  the  other  subclasses  on  the  phylogenetic 
tree  (Ludwig  and  Klenk,  2001).  All  Proteobacteria  are 
Gram  negative  and  posses  a  membrane  composed  of 
lipopolysaccharides.  Betaproteobacteria  play  a  pivotal 
role  in  plant  nitrogen  fixation  and  are  commonly  found 
in  environmental  samples  (Dedysh et al.,  2004).  Epsilon-
proteobacteria  are  known  to  inhabit  the  digestive  tracts 
of  animals  and  humans  (Miroschnichenko  et al.,  2004). 
Gammaproteobacteria  encompass  several  species  of 
medically  and  scientifically  important  groups  of  bacteria 
include  Salmonella,  Vibrio,  Pseudomonas  and 
that 
Escherichia  (Lee  et al.,  2005). 
    The  major  aim  of  our  present  work  is  to  study  the  se-
quence  evolution  of  Hsp20  among  all  five  subclasses  of 

Proteobacteria.  The  genomes  of  all  Proteobacteria  de-
scribed  in  NCBI  site  were  examined  in  order  to  find 
which  strains  posses  Hsp20.  Based  on  morphological 
phylogenetic  analyses,  four  to  seven  of  the  strains  rep-
resenting  the  five  Proteobacteria  subclasses  were  chos-
en  for  sequence  homology  analysis.  These  sequences 
were  then  analyzed  using  a  number  of  bioinformatics 
tools  to  determine  a  common  evolutionary  pattern 
among  Hsp20  among  the  subclasses  of  proteobacteria.

Methods

The  complete  Hsp20  protein  sequences  from  the  24 
Proteobacteria  microorganisms  were  obtained 
from 
NCBI  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).  The  protein  sequen-
ces  include  at  least  four  Hsp20  sequences  from  the  five 
subclasses  of  Proteobacteria.  Hsp20  was  chosen  after 
careful  examination  its  sequences  to  determine  that  it 
occurs  in  a  medial  amount  of  strains  of  the  Proteobac-
teria  phylum.  Hsp20  sequences  were  found  only  in  little 
over  fifty  percent  of  strains  in  this  phylum.  In  other 
words,  Hsp20  sequences  are  yet  to  be  identified  in 
many  bacterial  strains.  From  these  strains  preliminary 
phylogenetic  trees  were  assembled  to  determine  which 
sequences  were  most  closely  related  based  on  boot-
strap  values.  Four  to  seven  sequences  with  the  highest 
bootstrap  values  were  chosen  to  represent  the  five  sub-
classes  of  Proteobacteria.  The  Hsp20  protein  sequences 
were  aligned  using  the  multiple  sequence  alignment  pro-
gram  CLUSTALW  (Thompson  et al.,  1994).  Alignments 
were  performed  within  and  between  the  five  subclasses 
of  Proteobacteria.  To  compare  the  similarity  between 
the  Hsp20  protein  sequences  found  in  the  subclasses  of 
Proteobacteria,  Dot-plot  comparisons  using  Dotmatcher 
with  a  window  size  of  10  and  a  threshold  of  23  were 
performed  (Rice  and  Longden,  2000).  Dot-plots  are  used 
to  compare  the  similarities  of  a  very  closely  related 
genes  or  protein  sequences  (Chandra et al.,  2006).  They 
consider  only  the  diagonal  fragments  of  similarity  and 
project  them  onto  the  axes  of  a  graph  based  on  a  data 
matrix,  distance  matrix  and  a  chi-squared  analysis 
(Landes et al.,  1992).  The  neighbor-joining  method  was 
used  to  construct  phylogenies  from  the  alignments  of 
Hsp20  sequences  using  ClustalX  (Thompson  et  al., 
1997). 
    In  order  to  assess  the  level  of  significance  from  the 
inferred  clades,  a  bootstrap  procedure  was  used.  The 
resulting  trees  were  visualized  using  the  TREEVIEW 
(Page,  1996).  To  determine  the  possible  common  ances-
try  of  proteobacterial  Hsp20  proteins,  additional  phylo-
genetic  analysis  was  carried  out,  after  adding  17  more 
non-proteobacterial  sequences  (eight  from  firmicutes 
and  nine  from  actinobacterial  group).

Results 

Multiple  sequence  alignments  performed  within  all  of  the 
five  Proteobacteria  subclasses  resulted  in  at  least  thirty 
residues  of  high  sequence  conservation  (Fig.  1).  The 
most  positions  of  sequence  conservation  were  found  in 
Gammaproteobacteria  with  eighty-four  highly  conserved

residues,  followed  closely  by  Alphaproteobacteria  with 
eighty-one  highly  conserved  residues  and  trailed  by 
Epsilonproteobacteria  with  only  twenty-nine  highly  con-
served  residues.  Betaproteobacteria  and  Deltaproteo-
bacteria  fell  within  the  mid-range  with  forty-three  and 
thirty-two  highly  conserved  residues,  respectively. 
    Protein  sequences  within  and  between  the  five  sub-
lcasses  of  Proteobacteria  were  analyzed  by  Dot-plot 
comparison  to  align  protein  by  protein  between  two  mi-
croorganisms  (Fig.  2).  These  comparisons  allow  for  visu-
alization  of  sequence  breaks  and  co-linearity  among  the 
sequences  analyzed  (Chandra et al.,  2006).  The  dot-plots 
performed  within  the  five  subclasses  revealed  a  high  de-
gree  of  co-linearity  (Fig.  2A).  This  is  readily  apparent 
among  Alphaproteobacteria,  Betaproteobacteria,  and 
Gammaproteobacteria.  The  dot-plots  performed  be-
tween  the  five  subclasses  revealed  very  little  to  no  re-
gions  of  co-linearity  (Fig.  2B). 
    Comparative  analysis  of  the  24,  Hsp20  protein  se-
quences  by  phylogenetic  analysis  resulted  in  a  tree  with 

three  major  clades  (Fig.  3).  The  first  clade  consisted  of 
subclasses  Delta  and  Epsilon  group.  The  second  clade 
consisted  of  micro  organisms  representing  Beta  proteo-
bacterial  group  only.  The  third  major  clade  consisted  of 
subclasses  Apha  and  Gamma  group.  The  Alpha  and 
Gamma  clade  had  a  bootstrap  value  of  100,  but  the 
Delta  and  Epsilon  clade  had  a  bootstrap  value  of  76.  A 
rectangular  cladogram  constructed  using  both  proteo-
bacterial  and  non-proteobacterial  species  resulted  in 
possible  common  ancestry  of  proteobacterial  Hsp20 
proteins  (Fig.  4).

Discussion

In  view  of  the  multiple  sequence  alignment  performed, 
it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the  Hsp20  found  in  all 
24  Proteobacteria  sequences  shares  a  common  ances-
tor.  This  becomes  even  more  apparent  when  consider-
ing  the  multiple  sequence  alignments  within  five  sub-
classes  of  Proteobacteria.  The  largest  amount  of  con-

served  protein  residues  was  found  among  the  Alpha, 
Delta,  Epsilon  and  Gamma  subclasses.  From  our  se-
quence  analysis,  it  is  reasonable  to  conclude  that  the 
Alpha  and  Gamma  subclasses  evolved  together.  In  ad-
dition  the  Delta  and  Epsilon  subclasses  must  have 
evolved  together  leaving  the  Beta  subclass  to  evolve  on 
its  own.
    The  Dot-plot  comparisons  performed  within  the  five 
subclasses  revealed  that  the  Hsp20  sequences  showed 
a  high  degree  of  similarity.  This  result  is  particularly  ap-
parent  among  the  Alpha,  Beta  and  Gamma  subclasses 
compare  to  Delta  and  Epsilon  subclasses.  Again,  this 
data  highly  supports  the  work  performed  by  Ludwig  & 
Klenk  (2001)  in  that  the  Alpha,  Beta  and  Gamma  sub-
classes  are  separated  from  the  Delta  and  Epsilon 
subclasses.  In  addition,  it  is  becoming  highly  apparent 
that  the  Hsp20  heat  shock  proteins  are  divergent  be-
tween  the  subclass  of  the  Proteobacteria  yet  they  all 
share  a  common  ancestor.  Dot-plot  analyses  performed 
between  the  five  subclasses  either  did  not  result  in  any 
co-linearity  or  there  were  several  sequence  breaks  pres-
ent  in  the  comparison.  The  Dot-plot  comparison  per-
formed  between  Gammaproteobacteria  and  Alphapro-
teobacteria  revealed  some  sequence  similarity  with  sev-
eral  sequence  breaks.  Despite  the  sequence  breaks,  it 
appears  that  Alphaproteobacteria  and  Gammaproteo-
bacteria  share  a  more  recent  last  common  ancestor 
than  any  of  the  other  five  subclasses.
    The  phylogenetic  tree  clearly  supports  the  distinctions 
of  Hsp20,  among  the  five  subclasses;  this  is  evident 
from  the  multiple  sequence  alignments  and  the  Dot-plot 
comparisons  as  well.  There  is  a  clear  separation  of 
Betaproteobacteria  from  the  rest  of  the  subclasses  and 
but  not  among  the  subclass  itself.  This  suggests  that 
Hsp20  in  Betaproteobacteria  evolved  separately  from 
the  other  four  subclasses.  It  is  then  possible  to  hy-
pothesize  that  Betaproteobacteria  was  the  first  of  the 
five  subclasses  of  Proteobacteria  to  have  evolved.  In 
addition,  the  Gammaproteobacteria  and  the  Alphapro-
teobacteria  clades  are  joined  together  with  a  bootstrap 
value  between  them  of  100.  The  grouping  of  Alphapro-
teobacteria  with  Gammaproteobacteria  is  consistent  with 
the  near  equal  multiple  sequence  alignment  con-
servation  that  was  observed  and  the  Dot-plot  compar-
ison  between  the  two  subclasses,  suggesting  that  the 
Hsp20  heat  shock  proteins  among  Alphaproteobacteria 
and  Gammaproteobacteria  share  a  more  recent  last 
common  ancestor  than  do  any  of  the  other  subclasses. 
In  addition,  the  grouping  of  Deltaproteobacteria  and 
Epsilonproteobacteria  suggests  that  Hsp20  heat  shock 
proteins  among  these  two  subclasses  share  a  more  re-
cent  common  ancestor  than  they  do  with  any  of  other 
Proteobacteria  subclasses.  In  spite  of  the  separation  of 

the  subclass  clades  among  each  other,  the  separation 
of  Hsp20  between  the  subclasses  is  consistent  with  the 
Dot-plot  comparisons.  This  strongly  suggests 
that 
Hsp20  evolved  separately  within  the  five  subclasses  to 
adapt  to  the  needs  of  the  particular  subclass.  Further-
more,  analysis  of  proteobacterial  and  non-proteobacte-
rial  sequences  corroborated  the  possible  common  an-
cestry  of  proteobacterial  Hsp20  proteins  by  producing 
unique  clades. 

Future  Perspectives

It  is  clear  that  Hsp20  plays  an  important  role  among 
Proteobacteria  from  the  fact  that  it  is  not  only  present 
in  several  strains  of  Proteobacteria  but  also  that  the 
Hsp20  protein  sequences  are  highly  conserved  among 
the  five  subclasses  of  Proteobacteria.  In  addition,  it  is 
evident  that  Hsp20  shares  a  common  ancestor  within 
and  between  the  five  subclasses  of  Proteobacteria. 
However,  it  is  unclear  at  this  point  what  the  last  com-
mon  ancestor  among  Proteobacteria  Hsp20  heat  shock 
proteins  was  and  therefore  further  research  is  needed  to 
answer  vital  questions  in  this  regard.  Our  future  work 
may 
in 
Proteobacteria  and  Hsp20  in  the  rest  of  the  bacteria 
phylum,  or  going  even  farther,  and  finding  a  relation 
among  Archaeabacteria  and  Eukaryotes.  This  could  be 
achieved  through  further  bioinformatic  analyses  that  en-
compass  large  number  of  sequences  from  Bacteria, 
Archaea  and  Eukarya  domains.
