Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is widely used to identify the causative mutations underlying diverse human diseases, 
including  cancers,  which  can  be  useful  for  discovering  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  targets.  Currently,  a  number  of 
single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-calling algorithms are available; however, there is no tool for visualizing the recurrent and 
phenotype-specific mutations for general researchers. In this study, in order to support defining the recurrent mutations or 
phenotype-specific  mutations  from  NGS  data  of  a  group  of  cancers  with  diverse  phenotypes,  we  aimed  to  develop  a 
user-friendly tool, named mutation arranger for defining phenotype-related SNV (MAP). MAP is a user-friendly program with 
multiple  functions  that  supports  the  determination  of  recurrent  or  phenotype-specific  mutations  and  provides  graphic 
illustration images to the users. Its operation environment, the Microsoft Windows environment, enables more researchers 
who cannot operate Linux to define clinically meaningful mutations with NGS data from cancer cohorts.

Introduction

It  is  widely  accepted  that  mutation  is  the  main  causal 
factor for diverse tumorigenesis [1, 2]. The recent develop-
ment of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has 
revolutionized the speed and throughput of DNA sequenc-
ing, which facilitates the discovery of new driver mutations 
[3]. For example, the ARID1A gene is mutated in 83% of 
gastric cancers with microsatellite instability and the SF3B1 
gene is somatically mutated in 9.7% of chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia patients [4, 5]. In colorectal cancers, although the 
majority  of  recurrent  mutations  have  been  previously 
known, some novel mutations, such as the mutations in the 
SOX9  and  FAM123B  genes,  were  also  identified  by  NGS 
technology,  which  may  have  implications  for  colorectal 
tumorigenesis [6]. In melanoma, approximately 40% was 
found to have causal mutations affecting B-Raf function [7]. 
Along  with  the  well-known  driver  mutations,  the  novel 

mutations identified by NGS will be useful for predicting the 
prognosis and molecular characterization of cancers [8, 9]. 
Recently,  a  number  of  mutation  calling  tools,  such  as 
VarScan [10], Genome Analysis ToolKit [11], and MuTect 
[12],  have  been  developed  to  detect  single-nucleotide 
variants (SNVs) or indels from NGS data. However, SNV 
calling  from  a  single  cancer  case is  not  the  final  step  for 
defining  clinically  meaningful  mutations.  To  define  the 
pathogenic  SNVs  in  human  cancers,  a  commonly  used 
approach is to identify the phenotype-associated recurrent 
mutations in the study group. Due to the data size burden of 
NGS  output,  profiling  the  mutations  associated  with  a 
certain  phenotype  or  prognosis  in  a  study  group  by  a 
researcher who does not have a bioinformatics background 
or  facilities  is  very  difficult.  Currently,  there  is  no  user- 
friendly  tool  supporting  methods  for  the  detection  of 
recurrent or phenotype-specific mutations.

In  this  study,  in  order  to  support  the  definition  of 
recurrent mutations or phenotype-specific mutations from

NGS data of a group of cancers with diverse phenotypes, we 
aimed  to  develop  a  user-friendly  tool,  named  mutation 
arranger for defining phenotype-related SNV (MAP).

Description

MAP  software  was  designed  as  a  standalone  program, 
compatible  in  Microsoft  Windows  environments  with  a 
user-friendly graphic interface, and compiled codes of MAP 
can be easily installed. Both Variant Call Format [13] and its 
annotation  files,  such as  ANNOVAR  output [14],  can be 
used as input files for MAP. When a user loads the input file, 
called Sample Descriptor file (GSF), MAP software displays 
the sample set information and filter options (Fig. 1). Once 
data are loaded, the user can filter the data using the ‘Analysis 
Options' tab in MAP software based on annotation infor-
mation. By using the sample set and analysis options, MAP 
software generates the summary metrics for multiple sam-
ples. Summary metrics include the mutation status for each 
sample, total mutation frequency, p-values for differences 
between phenotype groups based on clinical information, 

genomic position, reference/observed sequence, and addi-
tional  information,  such  as  read  depth  by  default.  MAP 
software also displays more detailed information in sum-
mary metrics based on the user-selected ‘Analysis Options.' 
In the ‘Analysis Result’ tab, MAP software provides the fre-
quency- or p-value-based filter function. This functionality 
supports  detection  of  the  recurrent  mutations  in  study 
subjects  and  identification  of  the  phenotype-specific 
mutation that occurs significantly in a certain phenotypic 
subclass. Then, MAP software represents the user-selected 
mutations graphically in the ‘Visualization’ tab. To sort the 
variants by genomic position, p-value, or frequency, users 
can use the sort function in the ‘Analysis Result’ tab. Details 
of  the  program  download,  installation,  and  analysis 
procedures are available in the user manual.

The major steps of MAP are as follows.
- Generating mutation summary metrics in study subjects
- Determination of recurrent mutations by frequency
- Determination of phenotype-specific mutations by 
association test
- Graphical illustration of user-selected mutations

displayed  in  the  Source  tab.  In  the  Sample  Set  Files  tab,  MAP  software  displays  the  input  file  status  and  phenotype  information.  MAP 
software  supports  the  filter  function  in  the  Analysis  Options  tab  based  on  annotation  information.  Examples  of  the  Sample  Set  Files  tab 
and  Analysis  Options  tab  are  shown  in  red  and  blue  boxes,  respectively.  MAP,  mutation  arranger  for  defining  phenotype-related

Prerequisites

Mutation calling files from Genome Analysis ToolKit [11] 
can be used directly as input files for ‘Sample Descriptor.’ 
Alternatively,  manually  prepared  standard  Variant  Call 
Format [13] is also available. Annotation information files, 
such as ANNOVAR outputs, can be used as input files for 
Sample Descriptor. GSF is a comma-separated values text 
file that describes the input files, such as GATK output files 
and  ANNOVAR  output  files, and  phenotype information. 
MAP imports this Sample Descriptor file as the input file. 
Details are available in the user manual.

Generation of summary metrics

When users load the input file, MAP software displays the 
sample set information and filter options in the ‘Source’ tab. 
If any file is not prepared properly, MAP software informs the 
user in the ‘Sample Set Files’ tab. After data are loaded, the 
user can filter the data using the ‘Analysis Option’ tab based 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

on  annotation  information.  MAP  software  supports  eight 
filter options for exonic function. By using the mutation calls 
of each sample, MAP generates the summary metrics (Fig. 
2A). Based on user-selected filters in the ‘Analysis Options' 
tab,  summary  metrics  represent  additional  annotation 
information, such as gene name, function, known variant, 
and amino acid change. The additional annotations can be 
hidden using the SNP filter option in the ‘Analysis Option’ 
tab.  These  mutation  metrics  are  exported  into  a  comma- 
separated values text file for further investigation. 

Determination of recurrent or phenotype-specific 
mutations

In  the  ‘Analysis  Result’  tab,  MAP  software  defines  the 
recurrent  mutations  in  study  subjects  by  frequency.  The 
frequency  threshold  can  be  determined  arbitrarily  by  the 
user in the ‘Frequency Filter’ function. MAP also defines the 
phenotype-specific  mutations  using  the  mutation  metrics 
and phenotype information. Phenotype-specific mutations

that occur more frequently in one of two clinical conditions 
(e.g., drug-responder vs. non-responder) are determined by 
chi-square test under the user-defined significance level. 

Visualization

The graphic user interface is implemented in the software 
for  users  to  easily  handle  large-scale  data  or  access  the 
analysis result (Fig. 2B and 2C). The recurrent or phenotype- 
specific  mutations  can  also  be  demonstrated  visually  in 
heat-map style. Furthermore, MAP software can support the 
visualization  for  additional  information  at  a  time.  For 
example, the left and right of the heat-map represent the 
sample  name  and  mutational  spectrum,  respectively.  The 
bottom of the heat-map represents the gene name by color 
for  mutational  spectrum.  Frequency  or  p-value  plots  are 
represented on top of the heat-map (Fig. 2B and 2C). This 
graphical result can be exported into an image file for further 
investigation. 

Conclusion

MAP is a user-friendly program with multiple functions 
that supports the determination of recurrent or phenotype- 
specific mutations and provides graphic illustration images 
to the users. Its operation environment, Microsoft Windows, 
enables  more  researchers  who  cannot  operate  Linux  to 
define clinically meaningful mutations with NGS data from 
cancer cohorts.
