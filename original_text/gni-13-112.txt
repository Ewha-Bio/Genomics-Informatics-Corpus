The intron has been a big biological mystery since it was first discovered in several aspects.  First, all of the completely 
sequenced  eukaryotes  harbor  introns  in  the  genomic  structure,  whereas  no  prokaryotes  identified  so  far  carry  introns. 
Second, the amount of total introns varies in different species. Third, the length and number of introns vary in different 
genes,  even  within  the  same  species  genome.  Fourth,  all  introns  are  copied  into  RNAs  by  transcription  and  DNAs  by 
replication processes, but intron sequences do not participate in protein-coding sequences. The existence of introns in the 
genome should be a burden to some cells, because cells have to consume a great deal of energy to copy and excise them 
exactly at the correct positions with the help of complicated spliceosomal machineries. The existence throughout the long 
evolutionary history is explained, only if selective advantages of carrying introns are assumed to be given to cells to overcome 
the negative effect of introns. In that regard, we summarize previous research about the functional roles or benefits of 
introns. Additionally, several other studies strongly suggesting that introns should not be junk will be introduced.

Introduction

All  eukaryotic  genomes  carry  introns  as  parts  of  some 
gene structures and the introns are to be eliminated by a 
complex  molecular  machinery  called  the  spliceosome 
comprising five snRNAs and more than 150 proteins [1,2]. 
Although  the  debate  on  the  origin  of  introns,  i.e.,  the 
intron-early versus intron-late hypothesis, has still not been 
completed, it is obvious that most spliceosomal introns have 
been  gained  after  prokaryote-eukaryote  divergence  [3-5], 
and there has been no spliceosomal introns found in pro-
karyotic lineages so far. The intron has still been propagating 
in some eukaryotic lineages [6], whereas other lineages have 
experienced extensive losses of introns during evolutionary 
life history [2]. Primates have a higher density of intronic 
sequences than primitive eukaryotes that diverged earlier in 
eukaryotic  life  history,  such  as  yeast,  Drosophila  and 
Caenorhabditis  elegans.  Intron  sequences  constitute  app-
roximately 25% of the human genome, which is 4∼5 times 
the size of exons [7]. It has been noticed that the number of 
genes varies little between these eukaryotic species ranging 
less than 2-fold from 14,000 genes to 25,000 genes, whereas 

the  size  of  introns  greatly  varies  up  to  several  fold, 
implicating  that  introns  might  have  roles  in  determining 
species-specific characteristics and complexities [8].

Introns certainly impose a huge energetic burden to the 
cell, considering that the density of introns (i.e., the genic 
regions consuming large amounts of energy for nothing in 
terms of protein synthesis) is greater than that of exons in 
genomes.  The  reasons  that  introns  propagated  in  some 
eukaryotic  genomes  regardless  of  this  energetic  disa-
dvantage have been issues yet to be explained. According to 
Lynch  [9],  introns  are  just  selfish  DNAs  that  invade 
protein-coding  genes  in  eukaryotic  genomes,  and  the 
deleterious  introns  can  be  sustained  due  to  severe  po-
pulation bottlenecks. Many studies have discussed selective 
advantages  that  introns  bring  to  the  cell  in  eukaryotes, 
contributing  to  overcoming  the  energetic  disadvantage 
[2,10-20].  However,  the  results  derived  from  different 
studies are still controversial so far [13, 21-25].

Recent multi-omics studies using a large-scale genome, 
transcriptome, and epigenome data produced by massively 
parallel sequencing techniques or next generation sequencing 
techniques provide an opportunity for us to investigate new 
territories in genomes and lead to novel functional insights

into noncoding DNAs, intergenic regions, and introns. In the 
present  review,  we  first  introduce  some  studies  showing 
what molecular  characteristics of  introns cannot  be  expl-
ained by a simple random mutational process that real junk 
DNAs may have undergone. Subsequently, we summarize 
the  functional  characteristics  of  introns  that  have  been 
studied providing clues about the adaptive significance of 
introns in genomes. We divide the functional roles of introns 
into two different categories, i.e., direct roles and indirect 
roles in Table 1 [15,26-46], and demonstrate the details in 
the Results section. 

It is problematic, though, that the ‘function’ of genes in 
molecular biology generally has been limited in the concept 
of  ‘protein  function’.  As  recently  intensively  debated, 
‘biological  function’  should  be  extended  to  expression 
regulation  by  cis-acting  elements  located  at  the  outside 
regions of protein-coding parts in genes [47], and that is 
what we mean in discussing intron function.

Direct roles of introns

Regulation of alternative splicing
Introns  are  crucial  because  the  protein  repertoire  or 
variety is greatly enhanced by alternative splicing in which 
introns take partly important roles. Alternative splicing is a 
controlled molecular mechanism producing multiple variant 
proteins from a single gene in a eukaryotic cell. One of the 
remarkable examples of the increasing protein repertoire by 
alternative splicing is the Drosophila Dscam gene, of which 
over  38000  isoforms  can  potentially  be  produced  by 
alternative  splicing.  Pan  et  al.  [27]  have  provided  experi-
mental  evidence  suggesting  that  approximately  95%  of 
multiexon  genes  in  the  human  genome  may  undergo 
alternative  splicing.  Furthermore,  very  short  introns  are 
selected  against  because  a  minimal  length  of  intron  is 
required for the splicing reaction [28]. 

It has been noticed that the length of conservations in 
flanking introns of conserved alternative exons, i.e., exons 
that are alternative in several species, is greater than the 
length  of  conservations  in  flanking  introns  of  conserved 
constitutive exons, i.e., exons that are constitutive in several 
species  [26],  suggesting  that  introns  carry  cis-acting  ele-
ments  that  regulate  alternative  splicing.  In  fact,  short 
cis-acting  motifs  that  are  necessary  for  binding  splicing 
factors have been recognized and named intronic splicing 
silencers and intronic splicing enhancers. 

Positive regulation of gene expression 
The  expression  enhancing  effect  of  introns  was  first 
recognized  in  the  experiment  using  simian  virus  40  con-
structs with or without introns, showing that their protein 
products were significantly diminished without their introns 
[15]. Subsequently, Buchman and Berg [48] showed that, in 
a certain condition, constructs with introns were expressed 
up  to  400  times  higher  than  constructs  without  introns, 
suggesting that introns can strongly enhance gene expre-
ssion. In fact, some introns are designed to be included to 
construct expression vectors for guaranteeing a higher level 
of expression [49]. A large-scale analysis performed in yeast 
also confirmed that genes with introns tend to have a higher 
level of gene expression compared to genes without introns 
[50]. A similar observation was made in mammals, as well 
[51].

Classically, enhancers mediate either direction of expre-
ssion, up- and down-regulation of genes, and involve both 
spatial and temporal control of gene expression in a specific 
cell independent of genomic location [52]. On the contrary, 
intron-mediated enhancers (IMEs) mainly identified in plant 
generally act in the expression enhancement of genes and are 
primarily located in the first ordinary intron position within

a gene. In fact, in experiments performed in Arabidopsis, 
rice, and even mammals, the expression level of a gene with 
IMEs was increased up to 100-fold [29]. Genomic location 
and distance from transcription start site can influence the 
IME  activity  unlike  the  mode  of  expression  regulation 
performed by the classical enhancers [53]. 

Transcription  initiation  and  termination  processes  are 
cellular processes that involve introns, as well, which need 
some sequence elements in introns to be correctly comple-
ted. For instance, some studies showed that specific sequ-
ence elements in introns, such as enhancers and silencers, 
regulate  transcription  initiation  through  modulating  the 
function of the promoters of genes [30, 54]. 

Regulation of nonsense-mediated decay 
Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) was originally known 
as a surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes that selectively 
removes  mRNAs  containing  erroneously  generated  pre-
mature termination codons (PTCs). However, several recent 
studies have suggested that NMD may be another normal 
mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression regul-
ation [34, 35, 55]. Consistently, a recent study has shown 
that the levels of the expressions of genes important for plant 
development are regulated by NMD [36]. The question is 
how NMD recognizes the PTC-containing transcripts, i.e., 
what  the  molecular  characteristics  of  the  NMD  target 
transcripts are. Generally, NMD recognizes the transcript on 
which an exon-exon junction complex (EJC) resides more 
than 50∼55 base-pairs downstream of an authentic termi-
nation  codon  as  the  premature  transcripts,  i.e.,  its  target 
mRNAs, implicating that introns somehow play a role in 
recognizing the premature mRNA targets. Kalyna et al. [36] 
have  shown  that  introns  located  in  5’  or  3’  untranslated 
regions (UTRs) play important roles in controlling NMD- 
sensitivity of transcripts.

Introns may be associated with mRNA transport or chromatin 

assembly

It has been reported that spliced transcripts are exported 
faster from the nucleus to cytoplasm than their unspliced 
counterparts  [56,57]  indicating  the  association  between 
splicing machineries and nuclear export, although there are 
some contradictory studies [58,59]. In fact, nuclear trans-
port to the cytoplasm of transcripts containing introns in 
their 5’ UTRs was known to be regulated by the transcription 
export complex and the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, 
whereas the transport of transcripts lacking introns in their 
5’ UTRs was regulated by signal sequences located in the 
open reading frames (ORFs) of those genes [60]. A recent 
experiment  using  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  has 
investigated how intron-bearing and intronless constructs 
are distributed differently across the nucleus and cytoplasm 
and showed that intron-bearing transcripts are preferentially 

located in the cytoplasm [31].

There are some studies suggesting that introns may have 
a role in chromatin assembly as well. Recent genome-wide 
mapping analyses of nucleosome positions have shown that 
nucleosomes  are  relatively  depleted  in  intron  regions 
compared to exonic regions [32, 33]. Schwartz et al. [32] 
have suggested that sequence elements of intron ends may 
be  responsible  for  nucleosome  depletion  in  introns  by 
pushing the nucleosomes away toward exons. 

Indirect roles of introns 

Different  ordinal  position  of  introns  within  the  gene  has  a 

different functional role

The  first  intron  among  all  introns  within  a  gene  has 
particularly  been  a  research  focus.  The  first  intron  is  the 
longest among all other downstream introns within a gene in 
most species including plants and animals [38]. Addition-
ally, certain transcription factor binding motifs are enriched 
in first introns [61]. Different parts of genes have different 
average sizes of introns, e.g., the size of introns in the 5’ 
UTRs are twice as large as introns in coding regions [62]. In 
Drosophila, long introns evolve more slowly than shorter 
ones  and  first  introns  are  the  longest  compared  to  other 
introns [37,63]. In Tetrahymena, the introns located closer 
to the 5’ end of genes are more conserved than downstream 
introns. Our team also proved in a previous study that first 
introns  are  the  longest  and  the  most  conserved  [39] 
compared to other downstream introns. Furthermore, we 
showed that active histone marks, such as H3K4me1, and 
H3K4me3, are significantly enriched in the first introns, and 
the size of the first intron of a gene becomes bigger as the 
number of exons that gene carries increases. Additionally, 
we showed in the same paper that the proportions of regul-
atory histone marks are positively associated with the levels 
of gene expressions in 12 normal human tissues including 
kidney, heart, liver, and ovary [39]. 

Additionally,  a  replacement  of  the  second  intron  with 
other  introns  in  the  beta-globin  gene  in  human  led  to  a 
reduction of the efficiency of 3’-end formation [64]. Introns, 
particularly first introns, have important roles in the correct 
cytoplasmic  localization  of  some  mRNAs,  including  the 
Drosophila oskar gene and mRNA export [60,65] as well as 
in transcriptional and translational regulation [61,66,67].

Taken  together,  first  introns  among  all  introns  within 
genes have special functional characteristics, indicating that 
the existence of introns within genes is highly unlikely to be 
the product of a random process. 

Introns length matters in the efficiency of natural selection 
According to Comeron et al. [41], long introns are favored 
because they increase the efficiency of natural selection by 
releasing  The  Hill-Robertson  (HR)  interference.  The  HR 

114

www.genominfo.org

interference was basically described as genetic linkage bet-
ween two sites under selection in finite populations, leading 
to decreasing effectiveness of natural selection [41]. The HR 
interference model predicts that selection efficiency should 
be  different  between  genes  that  differ  in  exon-intron 
structures, so that genes with longer introns should be under 
weaker HR  interference by  increasing recombination bet-
ween two sites in two neighboring exons. In other words, 
introns  may  have  a  role  in  relaxing  intragenic  HR  inter-
ference between sites under the influence of natural sele-
ction in finite populations. Recombination gives the oppor-
tunity for two independently occurring favorable alleles at 
linked  loci  to  be  located  together  and  thus  enhances  the 
efficiency of natural selection [40], which can be one of the 
plausible  scenarios  of  how  introns  have  been  sustained 
through the evolutionary history of genes. 

Introns can provide a source of new genes
Recently, Carvunis et al. [42] suggested a very interesting 
hypothesis about how novel genes arise from non-functional 
translated  ORFs,  named  proto-genes,  by  showing  that 
hundreds of short ORFs of proto-genes located in non-genic 
sequences  were  actually  translated  and  might  provide 
adaptive potential to cells in different physiological enviro-
nments in Ascomycota phylogeny, including Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae.  According  to  their  model,  the  short  ORFs  can 
evolve into real functional genes through a kind of conti-
nuous evolutionary process. In that sense, long non-coding 
intron regions in higher eukaryotes can be a good reservoir of 
short and non-functional ORFs. 

Trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms are enriched in 

introns

Genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS)  has  been  a 
popular approach to identify trait associated genetic variants 
so-called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GWASs 
compare the allele frequencies of case groups (i.e., disease 
groups) and control groups (i.e., normal groups) of study 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

participants to identify the SNPs that are significantly more 
enriched in case groups than control groups. If an allele is 
significantly more frequent in case groups, the allele is said 
to be a disease-associated allele, or a trait-associated SNP 
(TAS). In theory, TASs are considered to reside near sites of 
actual disease-causing mutations in genomes. Interestingly, 
most of the TASs detected by GWASs have been mapped to 
intron regions rather than exonic or nonsysnonymous sites 
(Fig. 1A) [43,68]. The statistical significance of this finding 
was proven by a comparison of the proportion of intronic 
SNPs mapped by all SNPs obtained from ‘v dbSNP 142’ after 
subtracting the TASs (i.e., all SNPs minus TASs) and the 
proportion  of  intronic  TASs  (p＜0.01)  (Fig.  1B).  Investi-
gation of the functional implication of these intron-TASs will 
thus be an important research subject in the future.

Introns harbor several kinds of noncoding functional RNA genes
Recent  studies  based  on  massively  parallel  sequencing 
techniques have contributed to identifying various types of 
noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in genomes including miRNAs, 
siRNAs, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), 
and they are known to be preferentially located in the intron 
regions within genes [46]. For instance, about half of the 
miRNAs in the human genome are located in introns, and 
they are usually co-expressed with their host genes regulated 
by the promoters of host genes [44]. Similar to miRNAs, 
some snoRNAs reside in introns, and they are also regulated 
by host transcriptional and splicing machineries [45]. Other 
ncRNAs, including lncRNAs and siRNAs, are also found in 
intron  regions,  though  the  proportion  of  lncRNAs  and 
siRNAs  in  introns  is  lower  than  that  of  miRNAs  and 
snoRNAs in introns [2,46]. Introns are classically degraded 
after  the  completion  of  splicing;  however,  these  ncRNA 
genes embedded in intron regions are produced upon intron 
removal [2,46]. Furthermore, they can survive even longer 
than  the  intronic  host  genes  [2].  Considering  that  the

transcript. (B) The proportions of intronic
TASs and all intronic SNPs after sub-

ncRNAs located in introns are co-expressed and co-regu-
lated with their host genes by the promoters and splicing 
machineries of host genes, they are considered to be involved 
in auto-regulation of the expression of host genes [46]. 

Discussion

The existence of introns in genome is a real mystery, given 
the expensive energy cost for a cell to pay for copying the 
entire length of several introns in a gene and excising them 
at the exact position, controlled by big RNA and protein 
complexes  after  transcription.  Nevertheless,  most  comp-
letely genomes of eukaryotic cells so far carry introns in their 
genomes  [69,70],  and  some  studies  even  showed  that 
introns  had  been  propagated  during  eukaryotic  lineage 
evolution [3,9,71-73]. The origin of spliceosomal introns in 
eukaryotic lineage has been attempted to be explained by the 
massive  invasion  of  group  II  self-splicing  introns  from 
bacteria to eukaryotes [3,5]. It is very hard to understand 
how and why introns propagate in eukaryotic lineages and 
what the beneficial effect of introns on cell survival is. 

We reviewed here putative functional roles of introns in 
various cellular processes such as splicing, mRNA transport, 
NMD, and expression regulation. Besides, introns may give 
some advantages as a mutational buffer in eukaryotic geno-
mes  protecting  coding  sequences  from  being  affected  by 
randomly occurring deleterious mutations. Introns occupy 
about 40% on average of the total length of genes, which 
means that most randomly occurring mutations will fall into 
intron  regions,  and  do  not  affect  protein  sequences  and 
functions.  However,  it  is  not  clear  how  extensively  and 
strongly this buffering effect of intron regions might have 
evolutionary  advantages  for  intron  retention  against  the 
pressure of removing cellular burdens. 

Taken  together,  introns  are  clearly  not  junk,  and  they 
provide  selective  advantages  to  cells  to  be  evolutionarily 
maintained, nevertheless, it has expensive energetic costs. 
New advanced molecular biology techniques will lead to the 
functional territories of introns in a more detailed scale in 
the near future.
