Abstract

We  have  released  five  Java  Application  Programming 
Interface  (API)  packages  for  viewing  three-dimensional 
structures  of  proteins  from  the  Protein  Data  Bank.  To 
this  end,  the  user  interface  of  an  earlier  version  has 
been  refactored  in  an  object-oriented  fashion,  in  which 
refactoring  is  the  process  of  changing  a  software  sys-
tem  to  improve  its  internal  structure,  without  altering  the 
external  behavior.  Various  GUI  design  and  features  have 
been  provided  conveniently 
the  Model- 
View-Control  (MVC)  model,  which  is  an  architectural 
pattern  used  in  software  engineering.
Availability:  The source code and API specification can be 
downloaded  from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/j3dpsv/.

Introduction

Since  a  protein  structure  had  been  visualized  entirely 
with  computers  in  the  mid  1970's  (Beem  et al.,  1977), 
numerous  programs  for  visualizing  3D  protein  structures 
have  been  described  (Sayle  et al.,  1995;  Humphrey  et 
al.,  1996;  Bernstein  et al.,  2000;  DeLano  et al.,  2002; 
Berman et al.,  2002;  Westbrook et al.,  2003;  O'Donog-
hue  et al.,  2004;  Herraez  et al.,  2006),  and  programs 
such  as  Jmol  (http://www.jmol.org/),  RasMol  (http://www. 
umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/),  Cn3D  (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/Structure/CN3D/cn3d.shtml/),  SRS3D  (http://www. 
srs3d.org/),  PyMOL  (http://www.pymol.org/),  UCSF  Chi-
mera (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/), VMD (http://www. 
ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/),  YASARA  (http://www.yasar-
a.org/),  and  BRAGI  (http://bragi.gbf.de/)1  have  been  dis-

tributed.  However,  as  most  developers  were  targeting 
end-users  only,  the  readability  of  the  source  code  was 
generally  poor.
    We  had  built  a  3D  protein  visualization  module  from 
scratch  as  part  of  a  large  bioinformatics  project  (Cho et 
al.,  2007).  However,  the  architecture  of  the  initial  system 
was  poorly  designed  such  that  people  outside  of  the 
formal  developer  group  had  a  hard  time  in  under-
standing,  modifying,  and  even  utilizing  the  module.  To 
remedy  the  problem,  we  refactored  the  entire  code  in-
terfaces  of  the  initial  version  recently  to  enhance  soft-
ware  reusability  and  code  readability.
    Moreover,  we  decided  to  participate  in  an  open 
source  project  by  releasing  five  jar  packages  and  the 
Application  Programming  Interface2  (API)  specification  in 
Fig.  1  to  the  public  through  the  Sourceforge3  open 
source  repository.  API  differs  from  an  end  product  in 
that  it  is  the  source  code  interface  that  a  library  pro-
vides 
for  services  by  other 
programs.  This  dissemination  may  make  it  possible  to 
save  software  development  time  for  future  developers.

An  Exemplary  GUI  System

Reusable  modules  and  classes  reduce  implementation 
time  and  increase  the  likelihood  of  eliminating  bugs  and 
localizing  code  modifications  when  a  change  in  im-
plementation  is  required.  In  the  initial  version  of  the  in-
terface,  all  of  the  classes  got  tangled  with  each  other 
and  corrupted  the  concept  of  object-oriented  program-
ming.  However,  they  have  been  completely  redesigned, 
as  shown  in  Table  1.  This  table  summarizes  the  recent 
modifications  of  our  system,  and  the  interfaces  for  each 
class  are  documented,  similar  to  Fig.  2.  The  refactored 
version  is  now  composed  of  3851  lines,  compared  with 
the  initial  version,  which  was  composed  of  2765  lines  of 
code. 
    By  importing  the  five  packages,  an  exemplary  soft-
ware  system  called  J3dPSV4  1.0,  shown  in  Fig.  3,  has 
been  developed  for  viewing  3D  structures  of  proteins 
for  demonstrational 
from 
purposes.  J3dPSV  supports  visualization  of  proteins  for 
educational  purposes  by  simulating  simple  molecular 
graphics.  In  addition,  J3dPSV  interactively  displays  a 
molecule  on  the  screen  in  a  variety  of  color  schemes, 
molecular  representations,  and  animation  features.  The 
molecular  model  can  be  changed  by  selecting  the  list 
(cartoon  tubes,  backbone,  protein,  cylinder,  or  line)  in 

the  Protein  Data  Bank5

the  Style  combo  box  (by  importing  threeDModel.jar  in 
Table  1).  In  addition  to  the  default  color  scheme,  struc-
tures  can  be  highlighted  either  by  selecting  the  appro-
priate  amino  acid  properties  or  by  selecting  secondary 
structure  types  in  the Select  combo  box.  Ligands  or  wa-
ter  can  be  displayed  or  hidden  by  selecting  the  radio 
buttons  between  the Style  and  the Select  combo  boxes. 
A  rotational  animation  of  the  molecule  can  be  played  by 
clicking  the  play  button  (▶)  on  the  toolbar.
    In  complex  computer  applications  that  present  a  large 

amount  of  data  to  the  user,  a  developer  often  wishes  to 
separate  data (model)  and  user  interface (view),  so  that 
changes  in  the  graphical  user  interface  will  not  affect 
data  handling.  Indeed,  dividing  the  program's  structural 
architecture  between model  and view  increases  data  re-
organization  without  any  change  in  the  user  interface. 
The  main  class  of  J3dPSV  roughly  corresponds  to  the 
view  part,  and  the  five  packages  in  the  compressed  jar 
files  correspond  to  the  model  part  in  the  MVC  archi-
tecture,  respectively.

Conclusion  &  Future  Direction

implementation 

Bioinformatics  is  the  field  of  science  in  which  biology 
and  information  technology  merge  into  a  single  dis-
cipline;  research  in  bioinformatics  includes  method  de-
velopment  for  storage  and  retrieval  issues  of  data. 
According  to  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health,  the  de-
velopment  and  implementation  of  tools  that  enable  effi-
cient  access  and  management  of  different  types  of  in-
formation  is  one  of  the  important  sub-disciplines  within 
bioinformatics,  in  addition  to  the  development  of  new  al-
gorithms  and  statistics.
    This  paper  discusses  the 
issues. 
Computer  technologies  such  as  Web  Services6  and  re-
factoring  are  becoming  significant  in  the  field  of  bio-
informatics  tool  development  to  improve  internal  con-
sistency  and  clarity.  By  developing  an  exemplary  GUI 
system,  we  demonstrated  that  our  refactored  packages 
can  be  efficiently  imported  into  large-scale  bioinfor-
matics  applications,  for  which  an  integrative  analysis 
and  visualization  play  a  vital  role.  It  is  noteworthy  that 
J3dPSV  provides  most  of  the  fundamental  features  of 
3D  protein  visualization,  with  only  380  additional  lines  of 
code  after  importing  the  general  purpose  packages.
    Currently,  our  packages  do  not  provide  a  command 
language  interface  for  selecting  parts  of  the  molecule  for 
a  special  display  mode.  For  more  advanced  users,  we 
plan  to  provide  APIs  of  built-in  command  languages  and 
structural  prediction.  We  will  constantly  upgrade  our 
APIs  and  provide  additional  interfaces  with  more  power-
ful  features.

The  PDBOpen.class  in  the  pdbController.jar  package 
only  works  with  traditional  PDB  files.  Minor  mod-
ifications  could  be  necessary  to  make  it  compatible  with 
recent  changes  in  the  PDB  file  format  to  address  incon-

4The  sequence  table  of  J3dPSV  is  connected  to  the  3D  viewer. 
Clicking  a  mouse  button  while  hovering  over  an  appropriate  part 
of  the  selected  molecule  will  highlight  both  the  3D  image  and  the 
sequence  of  this  part  of  the  molecule,  and  the  label  above  the 
sequence  table  will  display  information  about  this  part.  Dragging 
the  sequence  table  will  bring  a  similar  result.  As  many  PDB  struc-
tures  consist  of  multiple  subunits,  clicking  the  Chain  ID  table  al-
lows  individual  chains  in  the  structure  to  be  viewed  or  hidden.
