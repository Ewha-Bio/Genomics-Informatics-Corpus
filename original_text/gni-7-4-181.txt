Abstract

Myotonic  dystrophy  type  1  (DM1),  which  is  a  dominantly 
inherited  neurodegenerative  disorder,  results  from  a  CTG 
trinucleotide  repeat  expansion  in  the  3’-untranslated  re-
gion  (3’-UTR)  of  the  myotonic  dystrophy  protein  kinase 
(DMPK)  gene.  Retention  of  mutant  DMPK  (mDMPK) 
transcripts  in  the  nuclei  of  affected  cells  has  been 
known  to  be  the  main  cause  of  pathogenesis  of  the 
disease.  Thus,  reducing  the  RNA  toxicity  through  elimi-
nation  of  the  mutant  RNA  has  been  suggested  as  one 
therapeutic  strategy  against  DM1.  In  this  study,  we  sug-
gested  RNA  replacement  with  a trans-splicing  ribozyme 
as  an  alternate  genetic  therapeutic  approach  for  amelio-
ration  of  DM1.  To  this  end,  we  identified  the  regions  of 
mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA  that  were  accessible  to  ribozymes 
by  using  an  RNA  mapping  strategy  based  on  a  trans- 
splicing  ribozyme  library.  We  found  that  particularly  ac-
cessible  sites  were  present  not  only  upstream  but  also 
downstream  of  the  expanded  repeat  sequence.  Repair 
or  replacement  of  the  mDMPK  transcript  with  the  spe-
cific  ribozyme  will  be  useful  for  DM1  treatment  through 
reduction  of  toxic  mutant  transcripts  and  simultaneously 
restore  wild-type  DMPK  or  release  nucleus-entrapped 
mDMPK  transcripts  to  the  cytoplasm.

Introduction

    DM1  is  an  autosomal  dominant  genetic  and  the  most 
common  neuromuscular  disease  in  adults,  affecting  ap-
proximately  5  to  20  out  of  100,000  among  the  world-
wide  population  including  Asians  (Harper,  2001).  The 
DM  mutation  is  a  CTG  trinucleotide  expansion  in  the 
3’-UTR  of  the  DMPK  gene  on  chromosome  19q  (Brook

et al.,  1992).  The  severity  of  disease  is  proportional  to 
the  number  of  the  expanded  CTG  repeats.  The  number 
of  repeats  is  in  the  range  of  5-35  in  the  normal  pop-
ulation,  and  DM  alleles  harbor  more  than  50  and  up  to 
several  thousand  repeats  in  DM1  patients.  The  patho-
genesis  of  DM1  is  directly  mediated  by  a  toxic  mDMPK 
RNA  that  is  entrapped  in  the  affected  cell  nucleus.  A 
number  of  pieces  of  evidence  suggest  that  pleiotropic 
effects  of  aberrant  interactions  between  the  mDMPK 
transcripts  that  are  retained  in  the  nucleus  and  RNA- 
binding  proteins,  such  as  muscleblind-like  1,  change  the 
metabolism  of  target  mRNAs,  including  splicing  (Whee-
ler,  2008).  Additively,  decreased  DMPK  protein  levels  in 
DM1  patients  due  to  loss  of  cytoplasm-localized  mRNA 
for  translation  could  cause  physiological  and  functional 
alterations  in  phosphorylation  of  target  proteins,  includ-
ing  CUG-binding  protein  1,  and  hence  has  been  sug-
gested  as  a  contributor  to  the  pathology  of  the  disease 
(Kaliman  and  Llagostera,  2008). 
    There  is  no  cure  for  DM  yet.  However,  several  ap-
proaches  to  reduce  the  mutant  RNA-mediated  toxicity 
through  elimination  of  nucleus-trapped  toxic  mDMPK 
transcripts  have  been  proposed  as  specific  therapies  for 
reversal  of  the  disease  phenotype.  They  include  ap-
proaches  with  antisense,  small  catalytic  RNA,  or  siRNA, 
which  can  reduce  the  level  of  mDMPK  RNA  by  directly 
targeting  the  expanded  CUG  repeats  of  the  mDMPK 
transcript  (Furling et al.,  2003;  Krol et al.,  2007;  Langlois 
et al.,  2003;  Mahadevan  et al.,  2006).  However,  high 
specificity  for  degradation  of  the  mutant  alleles,  non-
toxicity,  and  lack  of  off-target  effects  will  be  required  to 
minimize  nonspecific  reduction  of  the  normal  allele  and 
cellular  toxicity.  RNA  repair  or  RNA  replacement  has 
been  described  as  a  new  approach  to  human  gene 
therapy  against  genetic  disorders,  which  relies  on  the 
Tetrahymena  group 
ribozyme 
(Sullenger  and  Gilboa,  2002).  This  ribozyme  could  cleave 
a  target  5’-exon  RNA  and  trans-ligate  an  exon  that  is 
tagged  at  its  3’-end  onto  the  cleaved  target  RNA  both 
in vitro  and  in  bacteria  and  mammalian  cells  (Been  and 
Cech,  1986;  Sullenger  and  Cech,  1994;  Jones  et al., 
2006).  Therefore,  the trans-splicing  ribozyme  can  reduce 
the  level  of  a  specific  target  RNA  and  simultaneously  in-
duce  transgene  activity  specifically  in  the  target  RNA- 
expressing  cells.  Indeed,  trans-splicing  ribozymes  have 
been  successfully  developed  to  replace  mutant  tran-
scripts  that  are  associated  with  several  human  genet-
ically  inherited  diseases,  including  DM1  (Lan  et al.,

be  performed  first.  To  this  end,  we  employed  an  RNA 
mapping  strategy  based  on  RNA  tagging  (Jones  et 
al.,1996)  and  a  trans- splicing  ribozyme  library,  which 
has  been  described  in  detail  elsewhere  (Fig.  1)  (Lan  et 
al.,  1998;  Lan et al.,  2000;  Kwon et al.,  2005;  Ryu et al., 
2003;  Song  and  Lee,  2007).
    We  constructed  the  GN5  ribozyme  library,  which  is 
based  on  the Tetrahymena  group  I  intron  and  contains 
a  randomized  IGS.  Ribozymes  in  the  GN5  library  can 
bind  to  the  substrate  RNA,  cleave  at  any  accessible  U 
residue,  and  transfer  a  3’-exon  that  is  tagged  onto  the 
ribozyme  to  the  end  of  the  cleaved  5’-target  product. 
We  used  a  portion  of  the lacZ  gene  as  a  3’-exon  mo-
lecular  tag  in  the  GN5  library.  mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA  was 
synthesized  using in vitro  transcription  of  PCR-amplified 
vector  encoding  the  mDMPK  3’-UTR  gene  with  200 
CTG  repeats  (kindly  supplied  by  Dr.  Leonidas  Phylactou 
at  the  Cyprus  Institute  of  Neurology  and  Genetics).  In 
order  to  map  the  mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA,  GN5  library 
RNA  (10  nM)  was  incubated  at  37°C  for  3  hrs  under 

1998;  Phylactou et al.  1998;  Rogers et al.,  2002).  More-
over,  we  have  shown  that  trans-splicing  ribozyme  tar-
geting  and  replacing  the  human  telomerase  reverse  tran-
scriptase  (hTERT)  RNA  could  specifically  and  efficiently 
regress  human  tumors  not  only  in  cell  cultures  but  also 
in  animals  without  any  toxicity  in  normal  tissues  or  any 
off-target  splicing  effects  (Hong  et al.,  2008;  Jeong  et 
al.,  2008;  Kwon et al.,  2005;  Song  and  Lee,  2008;  Song 
et al.,  2009).  Thus,  a  trans-splicing  ribozyme  that  can 
repair  toxic  mDMPK  RNA  with  the  wild-type  one  or  re-
place  the  nucleus-entrapped  mutant  transcripts  with 
RNA  that  can  be  released  into  the  cytoplasm  would  be 
a  potential  tool  for  DM1  treatment.  To  this  end,  we  have 
developed  mDMPK  3’-UTR-specific  trans-splicing  ribo-
zymes  by  utilizing  an  RNA  mapping  procedure  that 
identifies  the  most  accessible  ribozyme  sites.

Mapping  of  the  trans-splicing  ribozyme 

    Any  uridine  (U)  residue  in  a  target  RNA  can  be  tar-
geted  for  splicing  by  the trans-splicing  ribozyme  through 
alteration  of  the  internal  guide  sequence  (IGS),  which  is 
the  5’-exon  binding  site  of  the  ribozyme,  to  make  it 
complementary  to  the  target  sequence  (Long  et al., 
2003;  Sullenger,  1995).  However,  the  ribozyme  can  ac-
tually  access  only  a  limited  number  of  uridines  on  the 
target  RNA  due  to  complicated  tertiary  structure  for-
mation  of  the  substrate  RNA  (Lan et al.,  2000).  To  de-
velop  most  potential  mDMPK  3’-UTR-specific  ribo-
zymes,  therefore,  identification  of  the  regions  of  the  tar-
get  transcript  that  are  accessible  to  ribozymes  should

ce  site  is  shown  in  parentheses.  Repeated  sequences  of 
CUG,  which  are  represented  in  a  box,  form  a  stable  hairpin 
structure.  For  brevity,  25  repeats  of  the  CUG  sequence 
were  drawn  in  this  figure.  The  extended  200  CUG  repeat  it-
self  also  formed  a  long  hairpin  stem  configuration.

NaCl,  5  mM  MgCl2)  in  the  presence  of  guanosine  (200 
μM)  and  in vitro-generated  target  RNA  (100  nM).  The 
trans-splicing  reaction  products  were  then  reverse-tran-
scribed  at  37°C  for  30  min  in  the  presence  of  arginina-
mide  (10  mM)  with  a  3’primer  that  was  specific  for  the 
ribozyme’s  3’-exon lacZ  sequence  (5’-ATGTGCTGCAAG 
GCGATT-3’)  (Jones et al.  1996).  Produced  cDNAs  were 
amplified  by  PCR  for  30  cycles  using  the  same  3’primer 
and  a  5’primer  that  was  specific  for  the  5’-end  of  the 
target  RNA  (5’-ACCCTAGAACTGTCTTCGACTCC-3’)  or 
downstream  region  of  the  expanded  CTG  sequence 
(5’-GGAATTCGGGGGATCACAGACCAT-3’).  The  am-
plified trans- splicing  products  were  then  cloned  in-
to  the  pUC19  vector,  and  sequences  of  several  clones 
were  determined.

Ribozyme-accessible  uridines  in  mDMPK  3’-UTR 
RNA

    When  we  analyzed  sequences  of  the  splicing  junction 
sites  of  the  trans-spliced  products  amplified  with  the 
5’-end  of  the  target  RNA  as  the  5’  primer,  several  ur-
idines,  only  in  the  upstream  of  the  expanded  trinucleo-
tide  repeat  sequence,  appeared  to  be  particularly  acces-
sible  (Fig.  2).  Long  hairpin  structures  of  the  expanded 
trinucleotide  repeat  might  hamper  PCR  amplification  of 

trans-spliced  products  that  result  from  the  splicing  re-
action  with  U  residues  downstream  of  the  trinucleotide 
repeat  sequence.  To  identify  accessible  U  residues  in 
the  target  RNA  that  were  present  downstream  of  the  tri-
nucleotide  repeat,  we  also  amplified trans-splicing  prod-
ucts  with  the  5’primer  that  was  specific  for  right  down-
stream  part  of  the  trinucleotide  repeat  sequence.  Then, 
several  uridines  downstream  of  the  expanded  CUG  re-
peat  sequence  were  also  shown  to  be  particularly 
accessible.  In  conclusion,  the  most  accessible  site  up-
stream  of  the  CUG  repeat  sequence  was  located  in  the 
uridine  at  position  99  of  the  mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA.  In 
addition,  the  uridine  at  position  854  of  the  target  RNA 
was  the  most  accessible  site  that  was  present  down-
stream  of  the  CUG  repeat.  Interestingly,  most  of  the  ac-
cessible  sites,  including  positions  99  and  854,  which 
were  identified  using  this  mapping  method,  were  gen-
erally  present  in  the  loop  or  bulge  region  of  the  RNA’s 
secondary  structure,  as  predicted  by  a  computer  pro-
gram  (Fig.  2).  In  contrast,  no  accessible  sites  were 
found  in  the  long  hairpin-formed  CUG  repeat  region.  In 
previous  studies,  we  showed 
relative 
trans-splicing  reaction  efficacy  at  different  sites  in  a  tar-
get  RNA  in  cells  and  in vitro  was  closely  associated 
with  the  predicted  accessibility  determined  by  mapping 
results  (Ryu  et al.,  2003;  Ryu  and  Lee,  2004;  Kwon  et 
al.,  2005).  Therefore,  the  ribozymes  that  target  the  ac-

cessible  sites  identified  here  are  anticipated  to  be  more 
active  than  those  that  target  other  sites.
    A  specific  ribozyme  that  targeted  position  99  or  854 
of  the  mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA  (Rib99  or  Rib854,  re-
spectively)  was  constructed  by  in vitro  transcription  of 
cDNA  template.  We  made  cDNA  template  by  PCR  of 
the  pT7L-21  plasmid  with  a  5’  primer  that  contained  the 
T7  promoter  and  each  ribozyme’s  IGS,  and  a  3’  primer 
that  was  specific  for  the  3’-exon  sequence,  as  de-
scribed  (Sullenger  and  Cech,  1994;  Jones et al.,  1996). 
The  pT7L-21  plasmid  encodes  a  slightly  shortened  ver-
sion  of  the  native  group  I  intron  from Tetrahymena.  The 
IGS  of  the  L-21 trans-splicing  ribozyme  (5'-GGAGGG-3') 
was  exchanged  with  5'-GGCGGT-3'  in  Rib99  or  with 
5’-GGAAAG-3’  in  Rib854.  The  specific  ribozyme  (100 
nM)  was  then  incubated  with  the  substrate  RNA  (10  nM) 
under  splicing  conditions.  RT-PCR  analyses  were  per-
formed  using  a  3'  primer  that  was  specific  for  the  3'- 
exon  tag  sequence  and  a  5'  primer  that  was  specific  for 
the  mDMPK  3’-UTR  RNA.  The  amplified  fragment  could 
be  seen  at  the  expected  size  of  197  bp  or  130  bp  when 
incubating  the  target  RNA  with  Rib99  or  Rib854,  re-
spectively  (data  not  shown).  Sequence  analyses  of  the 
amplified  trans-spliced  products  revealed  that  both 
Rib99  (targeting  the  upstream  region  of  the  expanded 
CUG  repeat)  and  Rib854  (targeting  the  downstream  site 
of  the  expanded  CUG  repeat)  accurately  employed  the 
trans-splicing  reaction  of  their  3'-exon  tag  onto  the  tar-
get  RNA  at  the  predicted  reaction  site  (Fig.  3).  These 
studies  indicate  that  specific  ribozyme  targeting  of  pre-
dicted  accessible  sites  can  replace  mDMPK  3’-UTR 
RNA  with  a  3'-exon  that  is  tagged  at  the  3'-end  of  the 
ribozyme  with  high  fidelity  through  targeted  trans-spli-
cing.
    Recently,  several  gene  therapy  protocols,  based  on 
inhibitory  RNA  or  short  oligonucleotides  that  target  the 
toxic  mDMPK  transcript,  have  been  described  for  DM1 
therapy  (Wheeler,  2008).  For  the  successful  application 
of  the  RNA-  or  oligonucleotide-mediated  strategies  to 
clinical  DM1  treatment,  specificity,  safety,  and  efficacy, 
in  addition  to  delivery  issues,  are  important  criteria  to  be 
considered.  In  this  study,  we  developed trans-splicing  ri-
bozymes  that  can  potentially  repair  the  mutant  DMPK 
transcript  with  the  wild-type  one  or  replace  the  mutant 
RNA  with  a  therapeutically  relevant  transcript.  In  pre-
vious  studies,  we  have  shown  that  hTERT-specific 
trans-splicing  ribozymes  could  specifically  and  effective-
ly  target  and  replace  the  hTERT  RNA in vivo  as  well  as 
in  tumor  cells  without  toxic  effects  on  normal  tissues 
and  without  nonspecific  off-target  splicing  to  other 
RNAs  besides  the  target  transcript  (Hong  et al.,  2008; 
Jeong et al.,  2008;  Song et al.,  2009).  The trans-splicing 
ribozyme  that  targets  upstream  of  the  expanded  CUG 

findings  showed 

the  cytoplasm.  Recent 

repeats  (Rib99)  that  was  developed  in  this  study  could 
be  used  as  a  repair  tool  to  restore  the  wild-type  DMPK 
protein.  A  major  advantage  of  the  RNA  repair  approach 
with  a  trans-splicing  ribozyme  for  DM1  therapy  is  that 
the  ribozyme  could  restore  and  maintain  the  regulated 
expression  of  normal  DMPK  protein  and  that  it  could  si-
multaneously  reduce  the  production  of  toxic  mutant 
DMPK  RNA.  However,  targeting  sites  in  the  mDMPK 
3’-UTR  are  also  present  in  the  wild-type  DMPK  RNA. 
Therefore,  one  limitation  of  the  RNA  repair  approach  is 
the  possibility  of  targeting  normal  alleles.  Although  tar-
geting  and  replacing  normal  DMPK  RNA  with  a  trans- 
splicing  ribozyme  will  not  lead  to  reduction  of  normal 
protein,  the  efficacy  of  repair  of  mutant  transcript  can 
decrease.  Therefore,  high-efficiency  targeting  to  the  tar-
get  RNA  will  be  a  critical  factor  for  a  successful  ther-
apeutic  outcome.  Another  developed  ribozyme  that  tar-
gets  downstream  of  the  expanded  CUG  repeats  (Rib 
854)  could  be  useful  to  replace  the  toxic  RNA  that  is 
entrapped  in  the  nucleus  with  RNA  that  can  be  released 
into 
that 
mDMPK  3’-UTR  that  is  aberrantly  retained  in  the  nu-
cleus  could  be  transported  extensively  to  the  cytoplasm 
when  it  has  attached  to  its  3’-end  the  woodchuck  post- 
transcriptional  regulatory  element  (WPRE),  which  can 
naturally  accumulate  hepatitis  transcripts  in  the  cyto-
plasm,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  myoblast  differentia-
tion  whose  initiation  is  failed  in  mutant  3’-UTR-express-
ing  cells  (Mastroyiannopoulos  et al.,  2005  and  2008). 
Therefore,  RNA  replacement  of  the  mDMPK  3’-UTR 
RNA  with  RNA  with  WPRE  could  stimulate  cytoplasmic 
release  of  the  mDMPK  transcript,  relieving  the  patho-
genic  effects  that  are  induced  by  the  toxic  RNA.
    Another  group  also  suggested  that  the  trans-splicing 
ribozyme  approach  may  form  a  therapeutic  strategy  for 
diseases  that  are  associated  with  repeat  expansions,  in-
cluding  DM1  (Phylactou et al.,  1998).  However,  the  au-
thors  constructed  and  characterized  a  ribozyme  that  tar-
geted  a  randomized  selected  site.  An  essential  factor 
that  influences  the  efficacy  of  RNA-mediated  gene  ther-
apeutic  approaches  is  the  accessibility  of  inhibitory  ele-
ments  for  binding  to  the  target  RNA.  RNA  mapping 
studies,  which  were  performed  in  this  study,  therefore, 
should  be  preceded  to  select  the  most  accessible  sites 
in  the  target  RNA,  develop  the  most  potent  RNA  in-
hibitors,  and  optimize  intracellular  anti-mDMPK  RNA 
activity.  Noticeably,  this  study  showed  that  very  stable 
RNAs,  such  as  mDMPK  3’-UTR,  were  successfully  tar-
geted  and  mapped  with  the trans-splicing  ribozyme.  The 
mapping  procedure  that  was  performed  in  this  study 
could  be  broadly  useful  for  the  identification  of  the  most 
accessible  sites  in  specific  disease-associated  tran-
scripts  to  develop  therapeutic  strategies  with  RNA  in-

hibitors.
