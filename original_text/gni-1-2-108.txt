Abstract 

We  have  constructed  a molecular linkage  map  of  pepper 
(Capsicum  spp.)  in  an  interspecific  F2  population  of  107 
plants  with  320  RFLP,  136 AFLP,  and  46  SSR  markers. 
The  resulting  linkage  map  consists  of  15  linkage  groups 
covering 1, 720 eM with an average map distance of 3. 7 eM 
between  framework  markers.  Most  RFLP  markers  (80%) 
were  pepper-derived  clones  and  these  markers  were 
evenly distributed  all  over the  genome.  Genes for defense 
and  biosynthesis  of  carotenoids  and  capsaicinoids  were 
mapped  on  this  linkage  map.  By  using  30  primer 
combinations,  AFLP  markers  were  generated  in  the  F2 
population.  For development of SSR markers in Capsicum, 
microsatellites were  isolated from  two  small-insert genomic 
libraries  and  the  GenBank database.  This  combined  map 
provides  a starting  point for  high-resolution  QTL  analysis, 
gene isolation, and molecular breeding.

Introduction 

Pepper (Capsicum spp.) is an economically important crop 
worldwide; it is the second most cultivated crop next to rice 
in  Korea.  Pepper consists of  12 chromosome pairs  with  a

variable genome size from 3,200 to 5,600 Mb (Moscone et 
a/.,  2003).  During  the  last  decade,  plant  genomic 
researches  have  become  an  essential  tool  for  plant 
molecular genetics  and  breeding,  and  its  first  and 
indispensable  step  is  the  construction  of  a molecular 
linkage  map  (Tanksley eta/.,  1992;  Thorup  eta/.,  2000; 
Huh  eta/.,  2001 ).  All  of  the  published  genetic  maps  of 
Capsicum  so  far  have  been  based  on  either  interspecific 
populations  (Livingstone  eta/.,  1999;  Grube  eta/.,  2000; 
Ben  Chaim et a/.,  2001;  Kang  et a/.,  2001)  or intraspecific 
populations  (Lefebvre  eta/.,  2002).  These  studies 
employed  RFLP,  AFLP  and  RAPD  molecular  markers. 
Nagy et a/.  (1998)  and  Huang  et a/.  (2000)  reported  the 
development  of  SSR  markers  from  a pepper small-insert 
genomic library on EMBL database. 

Here  we  report  the  construction  of  an  integrated 
molecular linkage  map  of pepper using  RFLP,  AFLP,  and 
SSR,  based  on  a  population  of  107  interspecific  F2 
individuals.  The  objective  of this  report  was  to  add  AFLP 
markers  into  a map  of  RFLP  and  SSR  markers  for  high(cid:173)
resolution mapping. 

Materials and Methods 

A total of 107 F2  plants, derived from the interspecific cross 
Capsicum annuum cv. TF68  x  C. chinense cv.  Habanero, 
were used as a mapping population. These parental plants 
were  chosen  by  analysis  of  genetic  distance  and 
hybridizing  ability  (Nahm eta/.,  1997).  DNA was  extracted 
from  leaf tissue of each individual plant following a method 
described in  Kang et a/.  (2001 ).  RFLP and AFLP  methods 
were described in Vos eta/. (1995) and  Kang eta/. (1997, 
2001)  and  the  SSR  method  in  Lee  et a/.  (2003).  Pepper, 
tomato,  and  tobacco  clones  were  used  as  probes  for the 
construction of an RFLP map. With 9 out of 64 EcoRI/Msel 
primer  combinations,  AFLP  analysis  was  performed  and 
136 AFLP markers were scored. 

Linkage  analysis  of  RFLP,  AFLP,  and  SSR  loci  was 
performed  using  MAPMAKER  3.0/EXP  (Lander eta/., 
1987).  To  identify  linkage  groups,  pairwise  comparisons 
and  grouping  of  markers  were  performed  using  the 
"group"  command at a maximum recombination fraction of 
20 eM  and a minimum  LOD  score of 4.0.  To establish the 
most  likely order within  each  linkage  group,  the  "order" 
command  was  used  and  the  remaining  markers  were 
added into frame map using the  '1ry"  command. The order 
of  markers  was  confirmed  using  the  "ripple"  command.

Fig.  1.  Combined  map with  RFLP,  SSR  and  AFLP  of  pepper.  The  linkage  groups  (LG)  (1-12)  were  labeled  according  to  synteny with 
tomato markers described in  Livingstone eta/. (1999) and Ben Chaim eta/. (2001 ),  and other groups were arbitrarily labeled according to 
total  map distance of each  linkage  group.  LG  8 is  not present in the  pepper map  anymore  as  a result of  matching corresponding  LGs 
between tomato and  pepper.  On the left of the vertical double lines are map distances in  eM  calculated  by the  Kosambi function  and on 
the  right  are  DNA  markers.  Markers  are  framework  markers  ordered  at  LOD>3  and  markers  in  the  parenthesis  were  placed  between 
framework markers at  LOD<3 or located  using  the  'try'' command.  Uppercase  letters at the end  of the  marker names  indicate that the 
marker is one of at least two segregating loci detected by a single assay.

Alternatively,  a framework of markers was generated using 
the  "compare"  command  and  the  best  order  was 
confirmed.  Recombination fractions were converted to map 
distances  in  centiMorgans  (eM)  using  the  Kosambi 
mapping function (Kosambi,  1944). 

Results and Discussion 
RFLP analysis 
To  perform  RFLP  analysis,  550  pepper clones  and  108 
tomato  clones  were  assayed  for  polymorphism  on 
southern  blot  survey filters  containing  parental  total  DNA 
fragments  digested  with  five  restriction  enzymes  (Oral, 
EcoRI,  EcoRV,  Hindlll,  Xbal).  Of the  550  pepper  clones 
assayed, the number of probes which revealed RFLPs with 
at least one enzyme was 255 (46%).  When tomato clones 
were  assayed,  63  out  of  108  clones  (58%)  showed 
polymorphism.  Of the  318  polymorphic  clones,  287  were 
usable for RFLP  linkage analysis,  the  other markers could 
not be  scored  clearly for  F2 individuals.  The  addition  of 33 
RFLP markers resulted  in a total of 320 RFLP markers for 
this map (Table 1 ) . 

AFLP analysis 
Reliability  and  reproducibility  of  AFLP  analysis  was 
evaluated  and  it  was  found  that  the  technique  is  both 
reliable  and  efficient for  marker selection  and  mapping  in 
hot pepper. 

With  9 out  of  64  EcoRI  I  Msel  primer combinations, 
AFLP  analysis  for  106  F2  individuals  was  performed  and 
136  AFLP  markers  were  scored  (Kang  et a/.,  1997).  All 
markers  were  scored  as  dominant  although  some  bands 
showed 
intensity  differences  between  putative 
homozygous  and  heterozygous  alleles.  Per  primer 
combination,  there  were  on  average  15.1  markers  for 
EcoRI  I  Msel  combination.  Although  many  more 
polymorphic  fragments  were  observed,  not  all  of  them 
could  be  registered,  due  to  the  dense  and  sometimes 
overlapping band patterns. 

The  usefulness  and  applicability  of  AFLP  markers  in 
genetic  linkage  mapping  was  evaluated  by  examining  all 
136 markers with 7t test for goodness of fit.  This statistical 
analysis  revealed  that  22  markers  out  of  136  (16.2%), 
deviated from the expected segregation ratio. 

SSR analysis 
Microsatellites  or simple  sequence  repeats  are  highly 
variable  DNA sequences that can  be  used  as  informative 
markers for the genetic analysis of plants and animals.  For 
development  of  microsatellite  markers  in  Capsicum, 
microsatellites were isolated from two small-insert genomic 
libraries  and  the  GenBank database  (Lee  eta/.,  2003).

Using  five  types  of  oligonucleotides,  (AT)1s,  (GA)1s,  (GT)1s, 
(ATT)w,  (TTG)w,  as  probes,  positive  clones  were  isolated 
from  the  genomic  libraries  and  sequenced.  Out  of  130 
positive  clones,  77  clones  showed  microsatellite 
sequences,  from  which  40  reliable  microsatellite  markers 
were developed. (GA)n and (GT)n sequences were found to 
occur most frequently  in  the  pepper genome,  followed  by 
(TTG)n and (A T)n. 

Isolated  pepper  microsatellites were  examined  for 
marker development.  Out  of  the  77  microsatellite  clones, 
29 clones were unsuitable for designing primer sequences 
because of partial sequence data (19 clones),  the location 
of microsatellite sequences near the cloning site (8 clones) , 
and  a sub-optimal  melting  temperature  detected  during 
PCR primer selection (2 clones). 

The  remaining  48  clones  containing  complete  and 
suitable  microsatellite  sequences  produced  products 
ranging  from  100 to  300  bp.  Primers  that  amplified 
products  were  given  serial  numbers  following  designation 
Hpms.  In  addition,  32  microsatellite  sequences  from  the 
GenBank accession were used for primer design. 

Combined mapping 
A total of 502 markers (320 RFLP, 136 AFLP, and 46 SSR 
markers) were placed in  16 groups using a minimum  LOD 
score  of  3.0  and  maximum  recombination  value  of  0.25 
(Fig.  1).  The  resulting  linkage  map  consists  of  10  large 
(206  - 60.3  eM)  and  5 small  (32.6  -1 0.3)  linkage  groups 
covering  1, 750 eM with an average map distance between 
framework  markers  of  3.7  eM.  LG  8 is  not  present  in  the 
pepper  map  anymore  as  a  result  of  matching  cor(cid:173)
responding  LGs  between  tomato  and  pepper.  This  map 
consists of 15 linkage groups although pepper has 12 sets 
of  chromosomes.  However,  more  recent  data  and  an

additional intraspecific map we are developing suggest that 
both  LG2  and  LG15,  and  LG12  and  LG13  are  syntenic, 
thus  reducing  the  number of  linkage  groups  to  13 
(unpublished  data).  The  numbering  of  LGs  is  consistent 
with other pepper and tomato maps. 

The total of 320 RFLP markers represens the addition of 
179  new  RFLP  markers  onto  the  SNU  map  which 
contained  141  RFLP  markers  (Kang  eta/.,  2001).  New 
additional  RFLPs included pepper genomic clones,  tomato 
clones,  defense-related  pepper clones,  pungency-related 
clones,  and other pepper genes.  In the combined  map,  63 
markers  are from  tomato  and  the  rest from  pepper,  which 
would  serve  as  a good  reference  for  pepper comparative 
genome studies. 

In  this  study,  most  AFLP  markers  could  not  be  placed 
unambiguously (multiple equivalent LOD scores) within the 
framework  map.  This  may  be  due  to  incomplete 
information  about  homozyous  and  heterozygous 
genotypes  of  the  AFLP  markers  in  the  F,  mapping 
population. 

The 46 polymorphic SSR loci have been assigned to the 
Capsicum  RFLP  linkage  map.  Of these,  13  SSR  markers 
were  obtained  from  GenBank  and  29  SSR  markers  from 
genomic  DNA  libraries.  Detection  of  discrete  loci, 
segregation  in  a Mendelian  fashion,  and  codominance  of 
these SSR markers made them ideal genetic markers. 

This  map  combines  the  strengths  of  different  marker 
systems and provides new opportunities for mapping in the 
large pepper genome. 

Our group  has  also  constructed  a pepper  BAC  library, 
containing about 15 genome equivalents (Yoo et at.,  2001, 
2003). The combined genetic map and physical map along 
with  this  BAC  library  are  very  powerful  resources  to 
construct a precise integrated map of the pepper genome.
