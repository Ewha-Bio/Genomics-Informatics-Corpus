Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is a high-resolution, high-throughput method of identifying submicroscopic genomic copy 
number variations (CNVs). CMA has been established as the first-line diagnostic test for individuals with developmental delay 
(DD), intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). CMA analysis 
was performed in 42 Korean patients who had been diagnosed with unexplained DD, ID, ASDs, and MCAs. Clinically relevant 
CNVs were discovered in 28 patients. Variants of unknown significance were detected in 13 patients. The diagnostic yield was 
high (66.7%). CMA is a superior diagnostic tool compared with conventional karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybri-
dization.

Introduction

Chromosomal  microarray  (CMA)  analysis  is  widely 
recognized and recommended as the first-tier cytogenetic 
diagnostic test for patients with developmental delay (DD), 
intellectual  disability  (ID),  autism  spectrum  disorders 
(ASDs), or multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs) [1, 2].

DD describes persons aged 5 years or younger who have 
demonstrated  several  significant  delays  in  the  following 
areas: cognitive, speech, social/personal, fine/gross motor, 
and daily activities. ID is diagnosed at or after age 5 years 
when one’s intelligence quotient is deemed to be less than 
70 and when permanent intellectual impairment results in a 
general deficit in adaptive behaviors [3]. ASD comprises a 
wide range of neurological and developmental disabilities, 
encompassing autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive deve-
lopmental disorders, and childhood disintegrative disorder 
[3]. MCAs refer to the presence of multiple major malfor-

mations, such as cardiac defects and missing limbs, or 3 or 
more minor malformations (e.g., syndactyly and club feet). 
Combined, these disorders are highly prevalent (DD/ID, 
up to 3% [4]; ASDs, 1% to 2% [5]; MCAs, 0.16% [6]) and 
might have a genetic etiology, such as copy number variation 
(CNV) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The prevalence of 
pathogenic CNVs is high in those with autism (5% to 10%) 
and children with both ID and MCAs (20% to 25%) [7].

CMA  is  a  high-resolution,  high-throughput  technique 
that detects submicroscopic CNVs that are not observable 
with traditional cytogenetic analysis tools, including karyo-
typing  and  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH)  [8]. 
Further, CMA has a higher diagnostic yield (12.2% on ave-
rage)  than  conventional  tests  [1,  2].  However,  as  with 
next-generation sequencing (NGS), interpreting microarray 
anomalies  poses  challenges  for  clinical  laboratories  and 
clinicians  in  establishing  the  clinical  significance  and 
pathogenicity of the detected CNVs. 

Variability  in  the  interpretation  arises  from  internal

databases that are limited by the number of cases that are 
analyzed; racial and socio-economic bias; and the complete 
lack of openly accessible centralized resources for sharing 
CMA data, patient phenotypes, and clinical interpretations 
between laboratories in South Korea and overseas. More-
over,  disparate  technology  platforms  with  varying  array 
designs, resolution, and coverage render the standardization 
of CMA and its uniform interpretation more difficult.

In this study, we attempted to establish the origin of DD, 
ID, ASDs, and MCAs in 42 Korean patients; demonstrate the 
value  of  CMA  in  determining  the  genomic  etiology  of 
unexplained DD, ID, and MCAs; and discuss the challenges 
facing CMA.

Methods
Patients

The parents and guardians of the probands were informed 
about the microarray study and given information about the 
risks, benefits, and limitations of CMA testing. Informed 
consent was obtained by a clinical geneticist or the rese-
archers.

The study sample comprised 42 individuals (29 males, 13 
females), ranging in age from newborns to 38 years, who had 
negative  test  results  for  metabolic  disorders  and  other 
suspected  disorders  and  did  not  present  with  any  reco-
gnizable syndrome.

Clinical  data,  including  medical  history,  were  collected 
from the medical records and the parents and guardians of 
the probands. General observations for dysmorphic features 
were  made,  and  the  height  and  head  circumference  were 
measured by the clinician or the researchers.

DNA preparation

Blood  samples  were  collected  at  the  time  of  consent. 
Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  peripheral  blood 
lymphocytes using the AccuPure Cell/Blood DNA Mini Kit 
(AccuBioMed Co, Ltd, New Taipei City, Taiwan) according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  DNA  concentration  and 
quality were measured using a NanoDrop One Microvolume 
UV-Vis  spectrophotometer  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA) and a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced 
Analytical Technologies, Ankeny, IA, USA).

Chromosomal microarray

CMA  tests  were  performed  with  Affymetrix  CytoScan 
750K  arrays  (Affymetrix,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA)  and  a 
GeneChip GCS3000dx V2 scanner (Affymetrix) according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  array  had  750,436 
markers  (550,000  non-polymorphic  markers  and  200,436 
single nucleotide polymorphism markers), based on genome

build hg19. The results were analyzed with Chromosome 
Analysis Suite ver. 3.2.0.1252 (Affymetrix).

Interpretation

CNVs  were  categorized  as  pathogenic,  benign,  and 
variants of uncertain significance (VUS) by considering gene 
content, size, inheritance pattern, and previously reported 
microdeletion  or  microduplication  regions.  University  of 
California  Santa  Cruz Genome Browser was employed to 
check all of the information relevant to the locations of the 
CNVs.  dbVar  (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar)  and 
the Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in 
Humans using Ensembl Resources (https://decipher.sanger. 
ac.uk/) were consulted to check clinically relevant structural 
variations and determine whether the observed CNVs were 
of clinical significance. We considered CNVs to be causative 
if  the  variant  was  responsible  for  a  known  syndrome; 
encompassed a gene(s) of known function; or occurred de 
novo or, if inherited, the parent was variably affected or if the 
involved gene(s) had been reported to be associated with 
ID/DD/ASDs  in  public  databases  and  the  scientific 
literature. The term VUS was used if the variants affected a 
gene(s) of unknown clinical significance and if, at same time, 
the  size  was  substantially  less  than  100  kb  (the  average 
resolution of the probes used) and when the family studies 
were inconclusive or unavailable [9].

Results

A total of 41 clinically relevant CNVs were detected in 28 
(66.7%) patients: three (10.7%) of those presenting with 
MCAs, 23 (82.1%) with a variable degree of DD or ID, and 
two (7.1%) with varying degrees of ID and ASDs; 10 (35.7%) 
patients had multiple rearrangements.

Among 28 pathogenic cases, nine were diagnosed with 
microdeletion/microduplication syndromes, including 1p36 
deletion  syndrome,  5q14.3  deletion  syndrome,  16p11.2 
deletion syndrome, 16p11.2 duplication syndrome, 19p du-
plication  syndrome,  9p  duplication  syndrome,  19p13.2 
deletion syndrome, and 22q11.2 duplication syndrome.

In this study, more pathogenic duplications were observed 
than deletions (22 vs. 19). Also, 12 cases (28.6%) were VUS, 
and two cases (4.8%) were benign CNVs (Table 1).

Discussion

Genomic CNVs can contribute to the etiologies of DD, ID, 
ASDs, and MCAs. With its proven diagnostic yield, CMA has 
been recommended by a number of professional societies as 
part of the standard assessment for individuals in whom the 
underlying cause is unclear [10, 11].

Evaluating  genomic  variants  identified  by  CMA  is 
time-consuming and difficult. Variations in their interpretat
ion  are  not  uncommon  due  to  platform  differences  (e.g., 
resolution and array design), lack of standardization, and 
differences  in  the  resources  that  are  available  to  and  the 
expertise of the bioinformatics team and clinicians [12].

At  the  time  of  writing,  South  Korea’s  National  Health 
Insurance  (NHI) does  not  recognize  CMA  as  a  medically 
necessary test nor does it subsidize the cost of CMA testing. 
NHI allows only multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampli-
fication  tests  for  four  microdeletion  syndromes:  Angel-
man/Prader-Willi  syndrome,  DiGeorge  syndrome,  Mill-
er-Dieker syndrome, and Williams syndrome [13]. Although 
subsidies for NGS genetic testing have received government 
approval this year, NGS tests are limited to a small number 
of pre-approved diagnostic gene panels. With NGS in the 
early  stages  of  clinical  application  in  this  country  due  to 
government  restrictions  and  due  to  insufficient  human 
bioinformatics resources and lack of a central system for a 
nationwide interlaboratory QA program and data sharing, 
there is currently no affordable high-resolution, high-throu-

ghput  diagnostic  genetic  test  for  CNVs  available  to  the 
public in South Korea. 

One major limitation of this study is that due to the costs 
of CMA, we were unable to investigate the families of the 
probands  to  confirm  the  clinical  significance  of  some 
detected CNVs. Other limitations were associated with the 
sensitivity  and  specificity  of  the  chosen  CMA  testing 
platform; low-level mosaicism and balanced rearrangements 
might not be detected [14]. For example, in patient 26, FISH 
revealed  a  derivative  chromosome  15  resulting  from  a 
translocation between chromosomes 9 and 15.

This  study  illustrates  the  ability  of  CMA  to  greatly 
improve  the  diagnostic  yield  (66.7%)  for  patients  with 
unexplained DD, ID, ASDs, and MCAs. However, it is also 
important to note that the clinical impact of CMA beyond the 
diagnosis  is  very  limited.  It  is  unlikely  that  any  genomic 
genetic test will lead to better clinical outcomes for adults 
with  DD,  ID,  ASDs,  and  MCAs,  because  the  genetic 
diagnosis often does not lead to an intervention strategy for 
adult patients. Nevertheless, the diagnosis will influence the 
parents’ reproductive planning, assist genetic counselors in

assessing  recurrence  risks  and  providing  guidance  to  the 
patients’  families,  and  ultimately  help  reduce  childhood 
morbidity  and  mortality.  Therefore,  we  recommend  the 
introduction  and  recognition  of  CMA  as  the  first-tier 
diagnostic genetic test in South Korea.
