DNA barcoding has been widely used in species identification and biodiversity research. A short fragment of the mito-
chondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence serves as a DNA bio-barcode. We collected DNA barcodes, based on 
COI  sequences  from  156  species  (529  sequences)  of  fish,  insects,  and  shellfish.  We  present  results  on  phylogenetic 
relationships to assess biodiversity the in the Korean peninsula. Average GC% contents of the 68 fish species (46.9%), the 59 
shellfish  species  (38.0%),  and  the  29  insect  species  (33.2%)  are  reported.  Using  the  Kimura  2  parameter  in  all  possible 
pairwise comparisons, the average interspecific distances were compared with the average intraspecific distances in fish 
(3.22 vs. 0.41), insects (2.06 vs. 0.25), and shellfish (3.58 vs. 0.14). Our results confirm that distance-based DNA barcoding 
provides sufficient information to identify and delineate fish, insect, and shellfish species by means of all possible pairwise 
comparisons. These results also confirm that the development of an effective molecular barcode identification system is 
possible.  All  DNA  barcode  sequences  collected  from  our  study  will  be  useful  for  the  interpretation  of  species-level 
identification and community-level patterns in fish, insects, and shellfish in Korea, although at the species level, the rate of 
correct identification in a diversified environment might be low.

Introduction

DNA  barcoding  is  a  simple  and  useful  step  toward 
understanding the ecosystem. It also serves to further our 
interests in biodiversity research [1]. A short standardized 
sequence (400-800 bp) of DNA can be used to distinguish 
individuals of a species. This approach was taken, because 
genetic diversity between species is markedly greater than 
that within species [2]. Numerous computational analysis 
methods and systems have been introduced for this purpose 
[3-5]. The use of this system can provide rapid, accurate, 
cost-effective, and automatable process for species identifi-
cation. The success rate of each barcoding application varies 
significantly among groups. Moreover, global datasets that 

represent extensive ecosystems are expected to be subjected 
to particular difficulties, especially in groups in which recent 
speciation rates are high and effective population sizes are 
large  and  reasonably  stationary  [6].  Several  studies  of 
species-level  identification  have  covered  many  groups  of 
organisms, including birds, fishes, and various arthropods 
[4, 6-8].

In order to use the barcoding system for species  iden-
tification, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences 
were obtained in this study from 529 sequences, represen-
ting  156  species  from  fish,  insects,  and  shellfish  in  the 
Korean peninsula.

Methods

The first community-level  barcoding studies were  con-
ducted in the most diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems 
in  an  inland  and  coastal  area  of  South  Korea  (include 
reference). We collected samples to obtain an overview of 
the variation patterns for 529 COI sequences among 68 fish 
species, 29 insect species, and 59 shellfish species. Multiple 
specimens were collected for most of the species. Fish and 
shellfish were collected from Yeosu in Jeollanam-do; shell-
fish were collected from Taean; and insects were collected 
from Chungcheongnam-do, Gangwon-do, Gyeongsangbuk- 
do, and Jeollabuk-do in South Korea. Samples were collected 
using  different,  technically  appropriate  methods  (Fig.  1, 
Supplementary Table 1) [9]. If possible, the samples were 
obtained from widely distributed places in South Korea.

Genomic  DNA  was  isolated  from  samples  using  the 
Qiagen DNeasy 96 blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, 
CA, USA) according to the instructions. DNA fragments of 
target genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) with primers for the COI gene (primer sequences: 
LCO1490 GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG and HCO 
2198 TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA) [10]. PCR 
amplification  was  performed  using  Top-Taq  PreMix  (2×; 
CoreBio,  Seoul,  Korea)  under  the  following  conditions: 
denaturation  (1  min  at  94oC),  annealing  at  51oC  for 
amplification of the COI gene, and extension (2 min at 72oC). 
PCR  products  were  purified  with  the  Core-One  PCR 
purification kit (CoreBio), and TA cloning was performed 
using the pGEM-T Easy Vector system (Promega, Madison,

WI, USA) by Macrogen Inc. The clones for each marker were 
sequenced  with  forward  (SP6)  and  reverse  (T7)  primers 
using an ABI 3730XL sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster 
City, CA, USA). The sequences reported in this paper have 
been  deposited  in  GenBank  under  accession  numbers 
HM180413-HM180941.

To  obtain  the  species  information  for  each  operational 
taxonomic unit (OTU) in a phylogenetic tree, a BLAST search 
was performed using the BLASTN program from NCBI [11]. 
A  cutoff  value  for  the  BLAST  result  was  established  as 
follows: query coverage ＞ 90% and identity ＞ 75% for COI. 
The levels of sequence divergence within and between the 
selected species were investigated using the pairwise Kimura 
2 parameter (K2P) distance model [12]. The neighbor-joining 
tree, with gap positions ignored on a pairwise basis, was 
constructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method with 
K2P  distances  in  MEGA4  [13].  These  distances  were 
hierarchically arranged in accordance with intraspecific and 
interspecific species differences within each genus. When 
the sequence dataset consisted of only 2 genera from the 
same family, an intergeneric comparison within the family 
was not performed.

Results and Discussion

After BLASTN annotation analyses were conducted, K2P 
distances  were  compared  at  different  taxonomic  levels, 
revealing distinct features in the sequences both within and 
between species. With respect to the COI sequences of the 
156 species represented, the interspecific K2P distances for 
the COI sequences from the 68 fish species, the 59 shellfish 
species, and the 29 insect species ranged from 0% to 45.25% 
(fish, 0% to 40.99%; insects, 0% to 10.34%; shellfish, 0% to 
45.25%) (Fig. 2A), whereas the intraspecific K2P distances 
with ≥3 sequences ranged from 0% to 0.985% (fish, 0% to 
0.985%; insects, 0.005% to 0.635%; shellfish, 0% to 0.817%) 
(Fig. 2B). The average interspecific distances and average 
intraspecific distances were, respectively, 3.58 and 0.14 in 
shellfish, 3.22 and 0.41 in fish, and 2.06 and 0.25 in insects 
(Table 1). In shellfish, the greatest interspecific K2P diffe-
rences were 25.57-fold higher than the intraspecific values. 
The overall base composition in each species of fish, insect, 
and shellfish was as follows: T (thymine) ranged from 27.4% 
to 33.7% (highly abundant); G (guanine) ranged from 16.8% 
to 21.5% (not highly abundant) (Table 1). These findings for 
fish were consistent with previous studies showing that T 
occurred  more  frequently  and  G  occurred  less  frequently 
than A (adenine) and C (cytosine) [8].

In our polytypic species analysis with more than 3 indivi-
duals in each species, the average intraspecific difference was 
approximately 0.5%, and the maximum intraspecific diver-

gence was only 1.86% (Table 2). The highest overall GC% 
content was found in the 18 species of fish. Lower values 
were found in the 2 species of insects and in the 6 species of 
shellfish (Table 2). The fish Chelidonichthys spinosus had a high 
GC% content of 50.9%. The mean GC% content of the 18 
barcoded fish species was higher than that of the 6 shellfish 
species (46.9 ± 2.2% vs. 38.0 ± 4.9%) (see also Table 2). 
Sixteen of the 21 species with GC% content ≥45% were fish, 
whereas only 1 shellfish species exhibited GC% content 
≥45%. The GC% content can be used in a new approach to 
evaluate  animal  evolutionary  relationships,  although  the 
relationship  between  GC%  content  and  the  evolutionary 
branching  date  is  not  very  accurate  [14].  Moreover,  the 
average divergence of congeneric species pairs was greater 
than that found for intraspecific differences, but 10 species 
in 5 genera had interspecific distances below 0.1% (Table 3). 
These  species  included  Hexagrammos  agrammus/H.  otakii, 

Ampedus humeralis/A. subcostatus, Anomala luculenta/A. mong-
olica,  Chlorostoma  argyrostoma  turbinatum/C.  turbinate,  and 
Omphalius rusticus rusticus/O. pfeifferi carpenteri. In addition, 
the NJ tree exhibited shallow interspecific divergence except 
at the first deep divergence (Fig. 3). In fish, several clades 
had a high level of bootstrap support (≥97%) (Fig. 3A). 
These  clades  included  Thrysa  chefuensis  and  T.  adelae, 
Hexagrammos otakii and H. agrammus. In insects, the clades 
that had a high level of bootstrap support (≥95%) included 
Fusinus forceps, F. longicaudus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and M. 
edulis. In shellfish, 2 clades separated out with a high level of 
bootstrap support (≥99%) (Fig. 3B). These clades included 
Anomala mongolica and A. luculenta, Ampedus humeralis and A. 
subcostatus (Fig. 3C).

In  conclusion,  we  obtained  DNA  barcodes  using  COI 
sequences from fish, insects, and shellfish. The aims of this 
research  were  species  identification  and  contribution  to
