Abstract

Osteoarthritis  (OA)  is  the  most  common  degenerative 
joint  disorder  in  the  elderly  population.  To  identify 
OA-associated  genetic  variants  and  candidate  genes, 
we  conducted  a  genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS). 
A  total  3,793  samples  (476  cases:  wrist  ＋ knee  and 
3317  controls)  from  a  community-based  epidemiological 
study  were  genotyped  using  the  Affymetrix  SNP  5.0.  An 
intronic  SNP  (rs4789934)  in  the  TIMP2  (tissue  inhibitor  of 
metalloproteinase-2)  showed  the  most  significance  with 
OA  (odd  ratio  [OR]  =  2.06,  95%  confidence  interval  [CI] 
=  1.52-2.81,  p  =  4.01  ×  10－6).  Furthermore,  a  poly-
morphism  (rs1352677)  in  the  NKAIN2  (Na＋/K＋  trans-
porting  ATPase  interacting  2)  was  suggestively  asso-
ciated  with  OA  (OR  =  1.43,  CI  =  1.22-1.66,  p  =  7.01  × 
10－6).  The  present  study  provides  new  insights  into  the 
identification  of  genetic  predisposing  factors  for  OA.

sequently  increases  serious  social/economic  problems  in 
the  elderly  population  worldwide  (Du et al.,  2005;  Ikega-
wa,  2007).  As  with  any  joint  affected  by  osteoarthritis, 
the  primary  symptom  for  wrist  and  knee  OA  as  predom-
inant  weight-bearing  joints  is  intractable  pain  with  in-
creased  stiffness.  Specifically,  wrist  OA  can  occurs  sec-
ondary  to  an  intra-articular  fracture  of  the  distal  radius 
or  an  extra-articular  fracture  resulting  in  malunion  (Weiss 
and  Rodner,  2007).  Several  risk  factors  such  as  age, 
gender,  obesity,  and  trauma  have  been  confirmed  as 
environmental  confounding  factors  (Haq  et al.,  2003).
    So  far,  genetic  factors  contribute  to  the  risk  of  OA 
have  been  identified  through  candidate  gene  appro-
aches  (Loughlin,  2002;  MacGregor  and  Spector,  1999). 
However,  candidate  gene-based  studies  (Miyamoto  et 
al.,  2007;  Mototani et al.,  2005;  Rodriguez-Lopez et al., 
2008)  have  only  a  small  fraction  of  genetic  interactions 
involved  in  the  pathogenesis,  and  thereby  provide  little 
chance  of  discovering  novel  candidate  genes. 
  As  a  solution  to  the  problem,  OA  susceptibility  genes 
by  recent  GWAS  have  been  reported  across  different 
groups  (Abel  et al.,  2006;  Dai  and  Ikegawa,  2010; 
Loughlin,  2002;  Spector et al.,  2006).  However,  most  of 
the  previously  reported  findings  have  produced  conflict-
ing  results  with  differential  genetic  effects  and  limited 
replication  between  ethnic  populations.  (Jiang  et al., 
2008;  Kerkhof et al.,  2008;  Shi et al.,  2008;  Snelling et 
al.,  2007;  Valdes  et al.,  2007).  The  ethnic-specific  var-
iants  remain  to  be  identified  in  East  Asian  population  to 
overcome  ethnic  difference  and  population  structure.  We 
therefore  undertook  a  genome-wide  association  study  to 
identify  genetic  polymorphisms  influencing  OA.

The  study  samples  were  drawn  from  the  Korean  Ge-
nome  and  Epidemiology  Study  (KoGES)  which  is  an  on-
going  prospective  community-based  epidemiological 
study  in  the  communities  of  Ansung  (rural)  and  Ansan 
(urban)  (Table  1).  Details  of  the  KoGES  and  the  methods 
are  described  in  our  previous  report  (Cho  et al.,  2006; 
Cho et al.,  2009;  Kim et al.,  2005;  Lim et al.,  2006).  In 
brief,  eligible  subjects  (age  40-69  years)  were  examined 
in  2001-2002  for  demography  and  epidemiology  and 
then  follow  up  biannually.  A  total  of  3,588  men  and 

122    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(3)  121-126,  September  2011

3,927  women  agreed  to  participate  in  a  baseline  exami-
nation  which  included  an  interview,  blood  tests,  X-rays, 
and  measurement  of  the  body.  Informed  consents  were 
obtained  from  all  of  the  participants,  and  Declaration  of 
Helsinki  for  biomedical  research  involving  human  sub-
jects  was  also  followed.  The  study  protocol  was  ap-
proved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  the  Korea 
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention.

Diagnostic  criteria

X-rays  of  both  wrists  and  knees  of  subjects  were  taken. 
Radiographic  OA  was  assessed  using  the  Kellgren/ 
Lawrence  (K/L)  grading  system  (Kellgren  and  Lawrence, 
1957).  Patients  with  K/L  grades  of  2  or  higher  in  wrists 
or  knees  were  diagnosed  with  OA.  Among  the  7,515 
subjects  of  the  study,  3,793  subjects  consented  to  the 
X-ray  examination.  Of  these,  476  patients  were  diag-
nosed  with  OA  (387  women,  89  men,  median  age  =  68 
years  [range  44-74]),  and  3,317  subjects  were  classified 
as  normal  controls  (women=1,773,  men=1,544,  median 
age  =  57  years  [range  43-74]).

Genome-wide  association

Genomic  DNA  from  peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells 
was  used  for  this  study.  We  performed  a  pilot  GWAS, 
typing  cases  and  controls  on  a  single  platform  using  the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  5.0  (Affymetrix, 
Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  Genotype  calls  were  de-
termined  by  Bayesian  Robust  Linear  Modeling  using  the 
Mahalanobis  Distance  algorithm  (Rabbee  and  Speed, 
2006).  Details  of  the  genotyping  process  are  presented 
in  our  previous  report  (Cho  et al.,  2009).  Of  the  SNPs 
assayed  on  the  chip,  179,626  SNPs  were  excluded  be-
cause  they  showed:  1)  a  call  rate  lower  than  96.0%  in 
cases  or  controls;  or  2)  a  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF) 
＜ 1%  in  the  population;  or  3)  a  significant  distortion 
from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p  ＜ 0.05).  A  total  of 
320,942  SNPs  passed  all  the  quality  control  filters  (mean 
call  rate  98.0%).  To  identify  the  effect  of  population 
stratification,  the  genomic  inflation  factor  (λ)  (Clayton et 
al.,  2005)  was  calculated  for  all  individuals.  The  two 
study  cohorts  (Ansung  and  Ansan)  have  shown  very

type  frequencies  in  both  cohorts  confirmed  the  genetic 
homogeneity  of  these  two  components  of  the  KoGES 
study  population  (Cho  et al.,  2009).

Statistical  analysis

The  allele  frequencies  in  OA  cases  were  compared  to 
those  in  controls  using  the  Chi-square  test  and  logistic 
regression  analysis.  The  associations  between  the  case- 
control  status  and  each  individual  SNP  were  measured 
by  the  odds  ratio  (OR).  Covariates  used  for  multi-
variable-adjustment  were  age,  sex,  and  body  mass  in-
dex  (BMI),  because  these  variables  were  significantly  as-
sociated  with  OA  in  our  cohort. 
    Pair-wise  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  among  the  poly-
morphisms  was  determined  by  the  expectation  max-
imization  algorithm.  When  determining  LD  between 
SNPs,  we  used  either  of  two  measures  of  LD:  an  r2  val-
ue  ≥ 0.8  or  a  disequilibrium  coefficient  (D’)  ≥ 0.95. 
PLINK  software  program  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/

mit.edu/mpg/haploview),  and  SAS  program  (version  9.1; 
SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  were  used  for  stat-
istical  analysis. 

Results

The  Q-Q  plot  indicated  lack  of  inflation  due  to  strat-
ification,  and  no  differences  between  case  and  control 
populations  were  detected.  The  estimated  genomic  con-
trol  inflation  factor  (λ)  was  1.009,  indicating  limited  evi-
dence  of  population  stratification  in  the  KARE  study

  Table  2  lists  the  most  significant  genetic  variants  from 
GWAS  analysis.  We  identified  two  intronic  SNPs  with 
P-values  ＜ 1×10－5.  A  SNP  (rs4789934)  in  the  TIMP2 
(tissue  inhibitor  of  metalloproteinase-2)  gene  showed  the 
most  significant  association  with  OA.  The  adjusted  ORs 
were  2.06  (95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  =  1.52-2.81), 
and  the  adjusted  P-values  were  4.01×10－6.  In  addition, 
our  study  also  identified  suggestive  association  in  the 
NKAIN2  (Na＋/K＋  transporting  ATPase  interacting  2)  (OR 
=  1.43,  CI  =  1.22-1.66,  p  =  7.01×10－6). 
    To  support  the  biological  relevance  in  silico,  we  pro-
vide  graphically  summarized  information  on  preliminary 
association  by  confidence  values  of  textual  evidence 
(Fig.  1.  D).  Nodes  represent  biological  entities  with  dif-
ferent  colors  for  different  classes.  Edges  represent 
strong  associations  between  two  entities  (i.e.,  TIMP2  ef-
fects  to  tissue  inhibition,  and  functional  interactions  with 
TIMP4).

Discussion 

In  this  study,  we  identified  two  novel  polymorphisms  as-
sociated  with  OA.  Intronic  SNPs,  rs4789934  in  TIMP2 
and  rs1352677  in  NKAIN2,  showed  significant  associa-
tions  with  OA.  To  date,  OA  susceptibility  genes  from  ge-
nome-wide  association  studies  have  been  reported  pri-
marily  in  samples  of  European  descent. 
    The  function  of  TIMP2  is  inhibition  of  MMP.  Osteoar-
thritic  cartilage  is  characterized  by  the  imbalance  bet-
ween  MMPs  and  TIMPs.  The  level  of  lytic  enzymes  such 
as  MMP-1,  MMP-3,  and  MMP-13  was  increased,  and 
the  level  of  TIMP-1  was  decreased  in  OA  cartilage 
(Krane  and  Inada,  2008;  Martel-Pelletier  et al.,  1994). 
With  the  decreasing  level  of  TIMP,  MMP  activity  in-
creases  and  leads  to  further  destruction  of  cartilage,  the 
key  process  in  OA  (Cawston,  1998;  Krane  and  Inada, 
2008).  Estrogen  may  regulate  the  balance  between 
MMP  and  TIMP  activity  (Lee et al.,  2003),  which  would 
explain  the  gender  and  menopausal  correlations  with 
OA.  Although  prior  reports  focused  primarily  on  TIMP-1, 
levels  of  TIMP2,  a  member  of  the  same  gene  family, 
have  also  been  shown  to  increase  in  osteoarthritic  carti-
lage  (Martel-Pelletier  et al.,  1994).  Lee  et al..  reported 
that  TIMP-4  polymorphism  (rs17035945)  was  associated 
with  the  risk  of  OA  in  the  Korean  population  as  a  result

of  altering  the  folding  of  the  mRNA  (Lee  et al.,  2008).
    The  Na＋/K＋  ATPase  is  an  important  regulator  of  ion 
homeostasis  in  many  cell  types  (Mobasheri et al.,  2000), 
but  its  role  in  OA  is  not  clear.  In  osteoblasts,  which  syn-
thesize  collagen  and  other  extracellular  matrix  (ECM) 
components,  the  Na＋/K＋  ATPase  appears  to  maintain 
the  transmembrane  gradient  of  Na＋ that  drives  intra-
cellular  calcium  homeostasis  and  ECM  calcification 
(Francis et al.,  2002).  Hence,  the  role  of  NKAIN2  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  OA  may  be  related  to  control  of  miner-
alization and maintenance of the ECM. However, the Na＋/ 
K＋  ATPase  is  expressed  in  diverse  cell  types  in  the  hu-
man  body  and  is  not  specific  to  OA.  The  detailed  con-
tributions  of  the  Na＋/K＋  ATPase  to  the  pathogenesis  of 
OA  should  be  clarified  in  further  investigations. 
    The  genetic  susceptibility  to  OA  is  likely  to  vary  for 
different  joint  sites  (Peach et al.,  2005).  The  criteria  used 
to  diagnose  OA  also  differ  among  studies  and  may  ex-
plain  conflicting  information.  Some  studies  used  clinical 
diagnosis  while  other  studies  using  X-ray  and  K/L  gra-
des  (Kerkhof  et  al.,  2008;  Miyamoto  et  al.,  2007; 
Spector  et al.,  2006).
    The  present  study  contains  some  limitations.  No 
SNPs  met  conventional  genome-wide  significance  level 
of  ＜ 5  ×  10－8,  and  no  replication.  However  it  would 
be  interesting  to  use  the  data  available  to  perform 
meta-analysis  or  SNP  lookup  from  a  large  international 
consortium  in  future  studies  to  evaluate  the  significance 
of  our  results.
    In  an  attempt  to  address  function  prediction  of  SNP 
allele,  we  conducted  in  silico  functional  investigation  to 
an  uncharacterized  sequence  variant  (Yuan et al.,  2006). 
The  lead  SNP  (rs4789934)  was  a  predicted  functional 
cofactor,  affecting  transcription  factor  binding  sites  in 
the  intronic  enhancer  region.  This  result  was  further  as-
sociated  with  functional  connectivity  derived  from  bio-in-
formative  approaches  (Lee  and  Shatkay,  2009;  Szklar-
czyk  et al.).  Therefore,  this  concordance  of  the  func-
tional  evidence  with  the  previous  studies  suggests  an 
encouraging  sign  of  the  results  in  our  GWAS.  However, 
the  biological  relevance  of  literature-derived  targets 
needs  to  be  fully  validated  with  experimental  tests.
    In  conclusion,  we  suggest  that  a  novel  polymorphism 
(rs4789934)  in  TIMP2  was  associated  with  OA.  Follow- 
up  studies  performed  with  multiple  ethnic  populations  or 
larger  sample  are  needed  before  the  effect  of  the  variant 
can  be  fully  and  accurately  evaluated.  We  anticipate 
that  identification  of  the  causal  variants  through  deep 
sequencing  and  their  functional  consequences  will  lead 
to  a  better  understanding  of  the  pathogenesis  of  OA.
