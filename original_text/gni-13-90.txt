Biological  diversity,  also  known  as  biodiversity,  is  an  important  criterion  for  measuring  the  value  of  an  ecosystem.  As 
biodiversity is closely related to human welfare and quality of life, many efforts to restore and maintain the biodiversity of 
species  have  been  made  by  government  agencies  and  non-governmental  organizations,  thereby  drawing  a  substantial 
amount  of  international  attention.  In  the  fields  of  biological  research,  biodiversity  is  widely  measured  using  traditional 
statistical indices such as the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance of species. However, 
some biologists and ecologists have difficulty using these indices because they require advanced mathematical knowledge 
and computational techniques. Therefore, we developed VBioindex, a user-friendly program that is capable of measuring the 
Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance. VBioindex serves as an easy to use interface and 
visually  represents  the  results  in  the  form  of  a  simple  chart  and  in  addition,  VBioindex  offers  functions  for  long-term 
investigations of datasets using time-series analyses.

Introduction

The  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  (CBD)  defines 
biodiversity as “the variety of life on Earth and the natural 
patterns”  [1,  2].  CBD  has  underlined  the  importance  of 
abundant  biodiversity  in  the  sustainable  use  of  natural 
resources [3]. Moreover, maintaining biological coexistence 
for all organisms on earth, including animals, plants, and 
microbes, is imperative for human welfare and quality of life 
[4]. Thus, many researchers use quantitative measures of 
biodiversity in an attempt to sustain and restore ecosystems 
[5].

Biodiversity is generally measured by statistical indices 
based  on  the  emergence  and/or  existence  of  various 
organisms  such  as  plants,  animals,  and  microbes;  these 
indices  can  provide  quantitative  criteria  with  increased 
confidence for biodiversity [6, 7]. Of the statistical indices, 
Shannon-Wiener index [8], species richness, and evenness 
[9] have been widely used as the gold standards, in spite of 
traditional methods. The Shannon-Wiener index is based on 
information  theory and is measured using the concept of 

entropy, and it is applied to estimate the degree of species 
diversity  in  a  region  [10].  Species  richness  and  evenness 
measure the number of different species per sample and the 
relative abundance of the different species, respectively [11].
For measuring biodiversity, there are a few non-commercial 
tools, such as the Vegan package in R [12], EstimateS [13], 
and  the  web-based  Shannon  Entropy  Calculator  (http:// 
www.changbioscience.com/genetics/shannon.html). 
Although they are highly useful, some of them are difficult 
and  complicated  for  biologists  to  use,  especially  some 
programs involving R package. While the web-based tools 
are easy to use, they are not suitable for personal and/or big 
data sets. Furthermore, some  programs do not  serve any 
function  for  long-term  investigations  of  data  sets  using 
time-series analyses for biodiversity.

We  developed  the  VBioindex  tool  to  aid  scientists  in 
evaluating the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and 
evenness. Additionally, this program depicts relative domi-
nance for each species. As VBioindex supports biodiversity 
analyses for a given period (e.g., for a month, quarter, or 
year), users can easily analyze a variety of biodiversity data 
while applying a time-series analysis.

VBioindex
VBioindex  supports  four  statistical  indices—the  Shan-
non-  Wiener  index,  species  richness,  evenness,  and  the 
relative  dominance  of  species—that  are  widely  used  as 
important criteria to evaluate ecosystems.

The Shannon-Wiener index (H´) was designed to predict 
the next letter of communication in a random set of data and 
to quantify entropy in terms of uncertainty or information 
content [10]. It has been widely applied in a variety of fields, 
such as biology and ecology. H´ is measured using entropy 
with  the  proportion  of  individuals  (n)  for  total  emerged 
species (s) [10].

Species  richness  (DMg),  known  as  Margalef’s  richness 
index, is a measure of the variety of species in a given area or 
sample [10], which is calculated based on emerged species 
(s), and the individuals (n) of total emerged species [14].

Species evenness (E) is the degree of the distribution of 
individual  organisms  among  species  [15],  which  is  mea-
sured using H´ and the log of emerged species (s) [16].

Relative dominance (RD) is the frequency of individuals of 
a species, which generally presents the degree of dominance 
for a species as a percentage [17].

VBioindex is implemented by clicking a few buttons, such 
as Open, Save, and some selectable radio buttons (Fig. 1A). 
An input data file is accepted as a tab-delimited file, labeled 
with the date, species name, and number of individuals (Fig. 
1B).  The  results  of  the  four  methods  are  graphically 
represented charts with a tab-delimited text output file (Fig. 
1C).  Along  with  presenting  these  biodiversity  indices, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  3,  2015

VBioindex  allows  time-series  analyses  at  a  monthly, 
quarterly,  and  yearly  basis  for  all  statistical  methods,  the 
functions of which are useful in analyzing long-term species 
diversity. VBioindex is programmed in Java language (higher 
than version 1.7), and it can be used in all operating systems 
in which a Java Virtual Machine has been installed.

Conclusion

Statistical  indices  evaluating  ecology,  such  as  the 
Shannon-Wiener  index,  species  richness,  evenness,  and 
relative  dominance,  are  considered  important  criteria  to 
sustain and restore ecosystems. Although there are a few 
programs for these indices, some programs are inconvenient 
to use and do not support various indices. We developed 
VBioindex,  a  user-friendly  program  that  is  capable  of 
measuring  the  Shannon-Wiener  index,  species  richness, 
evenness, and relative dominance. In addition, VBioindex 
offers options with which a user can analyze a variety of 
biodiversity  data  while  applying  a  time-series  analysis. 
VBioindex outputs a tab-delimited text file with visual charts 
and users can use the output text file with links to other 
statistical programs for a variety of ecological studies such as 

Fig. 1. Implemented VBioindex Frames: Mainframe (A) of VBioindex,
input  sample  data  form  (B),  and  visual  output  charts  (C)  for  four 
indices. Users can see the information such as contents and values,
by  waving  the  cursor  over  one  of  the  randomly  colored  bars.
