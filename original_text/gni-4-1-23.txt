Abstract
In order to investigate the molecular basis of the aging 
process  in  brain,  we  have  employed  high-density 
oligonucleotide  microarrays  providing  data  on  10,108 
gene clusters to define transcriptional patterns in three brain 
regions,  cerebral  cortex,  cerebellum,  and  hippocampus. 
Comparison  of  the  expression  patterns  between  young 
(6-week-old)  and  aged  (17-month-old)  C57BL/6  male 
micerevealed that about ten percent (1098) of the genes 
showed a significant change in the expression level in at 
least one of the three tissues. Among them, 23 genes 
were upregulated and 62 genes were downregulated in 
all three tissues of the old mice. The number of genes 
upregulated exclusively in hippocampus (337) was much 
larger compared to other tissues. Gene ontology-based 
analysis showed the genes related with signal transduction 
or molecular transports are more likely to be upregulated 
than downregulated in the aging process of hippocampus. 
These  data  may  provide  some  useful  means  for 
elucidating the molecular aspect of aging in hippocampus 
and other regions in brain.

Introduction
With  increased  life  span  resulting  from  the  improved 
socioeconomic  status  and  the  progress  of  medical 
techniques, the aging process becomes one of the most 
important research subjects in both social and biomedical 
sciences. One of the major problems in the elderly is the

cognitive decline, which is related with the aging process 
in the brain (Yankner, 2000). Despite a lot of research, 
themolecular basis of brain aging still remains unclear, in 
part because we lack a large number of biomarkers for 
aging process in the brain.

DNA microarray technology is expected to revolutionize 
the biomedical research field through the simultaneous 
analysis of gene expression patterns in the whole genome 
scale (Lander, 1999). There were several studies about 
microarray analysis of the aged brain in mouse, rat, or 
even human (Prolla, 2002; Blalock et al., 2003; Lu et al., 
2004; Erraji-Benchekroun et al., 2005). However, analysis 
with only one region of the brain has a serious limitation 
for the complete understatingof the molecular networks 
involved  in  the  brain  aging  processes,  which  are 
enormously complex phenomena related with multiple 
systems, cell types, and pathways. In addition, recent 
advances  in  our  information  about  the  genome  and 
development of the novel technology like microarray can 
provide much better chance to identify significant changes 
in gene expression as compared to a few years ago. For 
that  reason,  we  used  10K  oligonucleotide  microarray 
analysis  for  the  simultaneous  investigation  of  gene 
expression changes in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and 
hippocampus in young and old mice.

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals 
Male C57BL/6 mice were purchased at 1.5 months of 
age  from  Polars  International Corp. or obtained at  17 
months  of  age  from  Silver  Biotechnology  Research 
Center of Hallym University (Korea).

Mice were sacrificed by rapid cervical dislocation and 
brains were removed. For RNA extractions, the cerebral 
cortex,  hippocampus,  and  cerebellum  were  dissected 
and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 
-80°C. 

RNA isolation 
Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissues using 
TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, USA) and a power 
homogenizer  (Fisher  Scientific)  with  the  addition  of 
chloroform  for  the  phase  separation  before  isopropyl 
alcohol  precipitation  oftotal  RNA.  RNA  concentrations 

24 Genomics & Informatics   Vol. 4(1) 23-32, March 2006

were determined spectrophotometrically and the quality 
of the isolated RNA samples was assessed using gel 
electrophoresis.

Hybridization to expression array 
Total RNA (5 ㎍) was converted into double stranded 
cDNA using the cDNA synthesis Sytem (Roche) using 
T7-(dT)24 primer. The each cDNA was purified using the 
RNeasy kit (Qiagen;Valencia, USA). Each Cy3-(young 
mice brain), or Cy5-(old mice brain) labeled cRNA was 
synthesized using the Megascript T7 kit (Ambion; Austin, 
USA),  using  Cy3-CTP  and  Cy5-CTP  (APB/  Uppsala 
Sweden). The cRNA was purified using the RNeasy. 15 
ug of each purified cRNA was mixed and fragmented in 
the fragmentation buffer (40 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 100 mM 
KOAc, and 30 mM MgOAC) by heating to 94°C for 15 min. 
The fragmented cRNA was mixed with the hybridization 
MAGIC II-10K Oligo Chip (Macrogen;Seoul, Korea) for 16 h 
at 42°C. All preparations met Macrogen's recommended 
criteria for use on their expression arrays. The arrays 
were then washed and scanned with the Array scanner 
(APB). Acquired images were processed and analyzed 
statistically  for  interpretation  of  analyzed  spot  intensity 
results using Imagene v4.1 software (Roche). Nonbiological 
factors  that  may  contribute  to  variability  of  data  were 
minimized using global normalization/scaling with data 
from all probes sets. Each chip contains a total of 10,368 
elements of which 10,108 are unique genes/clusters. The 
length of oligonucleotides was 50-mer. 

Clustering and expression analysis
For the cluster analysis, total 1828 genes were selected 
by the criteria of two-fold change in at least two different 
samples. The software packages Cluster (version 2.11) 
and  TreeView  (version  1.60)  were  downloaded  from  the 
website of Eisen Lab (http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm) 
and used for the cluster analysis and visualization. The 
distance metric based upon uncentered Pearson correlation 
was used for the hierarchical clustering. For tissue-specific 
expression analysis, the genes that showed more than 
2-fold expression change in at least two samples from the 
same type of tissues were selected. 

Results and Discussion
Each microarray data was sequentiallyprocessed through 
global normalization, intensity-dependent normalization, 
and print-tip normalization. Finally each of three data from 
the same tissue was normalized according to the scale 
differences of multiple slides. Among the 11,520 probes 
mounted on the MAGIC II-10K Oligo Chip, we selected 

1,828 genes that showed more than two fold difference in 
at  least  two  array  data  sets  for  the  cluster  analysis. 
Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that each set of 
arrays  from  the  same  tissue  was  clustered  together 
except only in one sample, cerebellum #1 (Fig. 1). We 
found the similar results when different methods such as 
Spearman  Rank  correlation  or  Kendall's  Tau  method 
were applied for the cluster analysis (data not shown). A 
different  pattern  of  gene  expression  in  cerebellum  #1 
sample was so obvious that we concluded to exclude this 
sample for further analysis

in  different 

Then, we further selected the gene sets that showed 
the same pattern of expression in the same tissue. Total 
1,098 genes showed more than two fold upregulation or 
downregulation in at least twoarray experiments from the 
same tissue. Table 1 shows the classification of 1,098 
genes according to the pattern of expression changes. 
Interestingly, nine genes showed a different pattern of 
expression  changes 
is, 
upregulation in one tissue, but downregulation in another 
tissue. That is the reason why the sum of upregulated 
genes (656) and downregulated genes (451) is greater 
than 1,098. Table 1 also shows that the number of genes 
upregulated or downregulated in cerebellum is much less 
than in other tissues. This may be due to the exclusion of 
one sample from the cerebellum data set, which reduces the 
number of array experiments to only two. One interesting 
point from the table 1 is the number of upregulated genes 
in  hippocampus.Upregulated  genes  in  cerebral  cortex 
(244 total, and 134 exclusive), downregulated genes in 
cerebral  cortex  (266  total,  and  133  exclusive),  and 
downregulated  genes  in  hippocampus  (252  total,  137 
exclusive) showed a quite similar pattern of expression 
changes.  However,  the  number  of  genes  upregulated 
exclusively in hippocampus (337) was much larger than in 
other  tissues.  It  suggests  that  the  gene  expression 
change (especially upregulation) occurs predominantly in 
hippocampus, which may be related to the characteristic 
cognitive changes in the aging process.

Table 2, 3 and 4 show the top-ranked twenty genes 
that are upregulated or downregulated in each of three 
tissues. One of the notable findings in these tables was

that  a  member  of  protocadherin-gamma  subfamily  B 
showed the most dramatic decrease in the expression in 
all  three  tissues.  Cadherins  are  calcium-dependent 
cell-cell adhesion molecules that mediate neural cell-cell 
interactions,  and  protocadherins  (pcdh)  constitute  a 
subfamily  of  nonclassic  cadherins.  The  pcdh  gene 
clusters  are  known  to  have  very  similar  genomic 
architecture with the immunoglobulin and T cell receptor 
gene clusters, and can potentially provide a significant 
molecular diversity like them (Wang et al., 2002). Pcdh 
genes are present in most neurons, and are the primary 
candidates for synapse formation and cell survival during 
development  (Weiner  et  al.,  2005;  Junghans  et  al., 
2005). The dramatic change in the expression level of 
one member of the pcdh-gamma families suggests the 
possible  role  of  this  gene  product  in  the  age-related 
changes in the synapse and neuronal architectures.

Among the upregulated genes, grb2-related adaptor 
protein  2  (grap2),  lipocalin  2,  cystatin  7  (cystatin  F), 
sushi-repeat-containing protein (srpx, or drs), and matrix 
metallopeptidase 1b were prominent. There are some 
reports  about  the  roles  of  these  gene  products  in 
hematopoietic cells (Ludwig et al., 2003; Flo et al., 2004; 
Nathason  et  al.,  2002),  carcinogenesis  (Hanai  et  al., 
2005; Yamashita et al., 1999), or other disorders (Meindl 
et al., 1995). However, the distinct role of these genes in 
brain or senescence is largely unknown. One exception 
is the report from MacManus et al. (2005) that showed 
the upregulation of lipocalin 2 in mouse brain after focal 
ischemia.  Itsuggests  that  these  genes  have  very 
restricted roles in normal brain, but may be related to 
aging process itself or aging-related phenotypes in some 
part of the nervous system.

Table 5 and 6 show the list of genes up- or down-regulated
in tissue specific manners. We believe that this type of 
analysis would be more efficient in estimating the role of 
possible  target  genes  in  aging  process.  For  example, 
laminin  alpha  1  was  downregulated  significantly  in  all 
three tissues although it could not be easily foundin the list 
of  top-ranked  downregulated  genes.  Laminin  is  a 
basement membrane protein, and a variety of different 
laminins can be found in the vascular basement membrane 
of the adult and aged brain (Jucker et al., 1996). Laminin 
alpha 1 has been found to be overexpressed in Alzheimer's 
disease 
to  reactive 
astrocytes of the gray and white matter, and as punctate 
deposits in the senile plaques of the Alzheimer's brain 
tissue (Palu et al., 2002). On the contrary, Morita et al. 
(2005) reported a decrease in laminin immunolabeling in 
the  capillary  basement  membranes  of  old  dogs.  The 
investigation of correlation between the heterogeneity of 
laminin  expression  and  the  structural  and  functional 

frontal  cortex,  and 

localized

diversity of the vascular basement membranes in aging 
process would be an interesting topic in this field. 

The genes up- or down-regulated in only one tissue, 
especially in hippocampus, would be attractive targets 

for  research  about  cognitive  changes  in  the  aging 
process. Transthyretin (also known as prealbumin), the 
major transporter of thyroid hormones was one of the 
most highly upregulated genes in hippocampus (Table

5).  Transthyretin  has  been  well  known  to  bind  the 
Alzheimer beta-peptide and to be a possible protector 
against  neurodegeneration.  Recent  findings  suggest 
new  roles  of  this  protein  related  with  depression-like 
behavior  or  other  psychiatric  disorders  (Sousa  et  al.,

Monti et al., 2005; Brightwell et al., 2004). This would be 
another  example  providing  the  reliability  of  our  study 
results. 

Finally we tried to analyze the distribution of up- or 
down-regulated genes according to the gene ontology 

classification  that  was  provided  by  the  microarray 
company, Macrogen. Although most of the gene ontology 
classes  had  similar  distribution  of  up-  and  down- 
regulated  genes,  some  of  them  showed  interesting 
patterns (Table 7). For example, the genes involved in 
G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathways

have a dominance of upregulation in hippocampus and 
downregulation  in  cerebellum.  Similarly,  the  genes 
classified as small GTPase mediated signal transduction 
were more upregulated than downregulated in hippocampus. 
The meaning of these findings can not be easily explained. 
However, with the findingthat more genes are upregulated 
in  hippocampus  than  in  other  tissues  (Table  1)  and 
several classes related with signaling or transport have 
tendency of upregulation in hippocampus (Table 7), we 
can suggest that the senescence in hippocampus may be 
linked  to  gain  of  function  related  with  active  signal 
transduction rather than just passive changes of dysfunction. 
We believe that a lot of investigations are still required in 
this area, and our result may provide some useful tools for 
studying the molecular aspect of aging in the brain.
