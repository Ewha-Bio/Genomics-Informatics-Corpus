SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) elements are present in hominoid primates and are divided into 6 subfamilies (SVA-A to SVA-F) and 
active in the human population. Using a bioinformatic tool, 22 SVA element-associated genes are identified in the human 

genome. In an analysis of genomic structure, SVA elements are detected in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of HGSNAT 
the 3′UTR of SPICE1 (SVA-B), TDRKH (SVA-C), GOSR1 (SVA-D), BBS5 (SVA-D), NEK5 (SVA-D), ABHD2 (SVA-F), C1QTNF7 (SVA-F), 

(SVA-B), MRGPRX3 (SVA-D), HYAL1 (SVA-F), TCHH (SVA-F), and ATXN2L (SVA-F) genes, while some elements are observed in 

ORC6L (SVA-F), TMEM69 (SVA-F), and CCDC137 (SVA-F) genes. They could contribute to exon extension or supplying poly A 
signals. LEPR (SVA-C), ALOX5 (SVA-D), PDS5B (SVA-D), and ABCA10 (SVA-F) genes also showed alternative transcripts by SVA 
exonization events. Dominant expression of HYAL1_SVA appeared in lung tissues, while HYAL1_noSVA showed ubiquitous 
expression in various human tissues. Expression of both transcripts (TDRKH_SVA and TDRKH_noSVA) of the TDRKH gene 
appeared to be ubiquitous. Taken together, these data suggest that SVA elements cause transcript isoforms that contribute 
to modulation of gene regulation in various human tissues.

Introduction

The human genome contains actively moving retrotrans-
posons (human endogenous retrovirus [HERV], long inter-
spersed nucleotide element [LINE], and short interspersed 
nucleotide  element  [SINE]).  Approximately  36%  of  the 
human  genome  has  been  generated  through  retrotrans-
position of LINE and other RNA species by the LINE reverse 
transcriptase [1, 2]. Retrotransposition is progressing in the 
human population by L1, Alu, and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) 
insertions [3]. L1 is an autonomous retrotransposon that 
contains  an  internal  RNA  polymerase  II  promoter  and  a 
reverse transcriptase, whereas Alu and SVA lack activities for 
independent mobilization [4, 5]. Therefore, Alu and SVA are 
assumed  to  use  the  L1  protein  machinery  for  their  own 
mobilization [3], and retrotransposition events of marked 
SVA  elements  occur  indeed  by  L1  elements  in  human 
cultured cells [5, 6]. 

The SVA elements were originally named from the SINE- 
R retroposon, derived from an endogenous retrovirus, the 

HERV-K  LTR  element.  SINE-R11,  14,  and  19  have  been 
isolated by colony blot hybridization using the LTR element 
as probe [7]. SINE-R.C2 has been found in the third intron 
of the C2 gene on the short arm of human chromosome 6, 
which was a human-specific element [8]. Within the Xq21.3 
block, two SINE-R retroposons (HS307 and HS408) were 
identified [9]. Multiple copy numbers of retroposons have 
been  successively  detected  in  hominoid  primates  and 
humans [9-16]. Other similar sequences have been asso-
ciated with Alu-like sequences within the HLA-RP1 (STK19) 
gene  [17].  These  composite  retroposons  with  the  entire 
structure are named SVA (SINE-R, VNTR, and Alu).

The SVA families are evolutionarily young and hominoid- 
specific  retroelements.  They  have  ability  to  influence  a 
genomic locus in which they reside and cause various human 
diseases as insertional mutagens. In fact, Fukuyama mus-
cular dystrophy (FCMD) is derived from the polymorphic 
SVA-E insertion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the 
FUKUTIN gene [18]. SVA elements could also drive tran-
scription of functional genes. In the 5' upstream region of

TBPL2,  the  SVA  element  serves  as  a  promoter,  while  the 
SVA-D  element  in  the  WDR66  gene  promotes  the  tran-
scription of a human-specific transcript variant [19]. Here, 
we analyzed structure variants of functional genes mediated 
by SVA subfamilies and examined their expression patterns 
in various human tissues.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis

To identify SVA consensus sequences in the human ge-
nome, we obtained SVA sequences from the Giri database 
(http://www.girinst.org). The SVA subfamilies were aligned 
using the BioEdit program [20]. Then, we identified SVAs in 
each region. RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) 
and the UCSC genome site (http://genome.ucsc.edu) were 
employed to analyze isoform structures of functional genes. 
The human expressed sequence tag and RefSeq mRNA were 
also used to identify alternatively spliced transcripts. The 
expression pattern of SVA fusion genes in normal human 
tissues  was  analyzed  using  GeneCard  (http://www.gene-
cards.org). We obtained microarray data from the BioGPS 
database,  and then we  generated  a heatmap according  to 
microarray values. High expression levels were indicated by 
brighter color, and low expression levels were indicated by 
darker color.

Human RNA samples

bone marrow; 3, cerebellum; 4, whole brain; 5, fetal brain; 6, 
fetal liver; 7, heart; 8, kidney; 9, liver; 10, lung; 11, placenta;

20, uterus) was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, 
CA, USA).

Reverse-transcription (RT) and reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification

To eliminate possible DNA contamination of purchased 
RNA samples, Turbo DNA-free (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) 
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 
no-RT  control  was  also  amplified  to  double-check  the 
absence of DNA contamination. Quantity of RNA samples 
was measured using a ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer 
(NanoDrop,  Wilmington,  DE,  USA).  Moloney-Murine- 
Leukemia-Virus  reverse  transcriptase  with  an  annealing 
temperature  of  42°C  was  used  for  the  RT  reaction  with 
RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). To develop 
the  specific  primers  for  individual  alternative  transcripts, 
primer pairs were designed with the aid of Primer3 (http:// 
frodo.wi.mit.edu/) (Table 1). In each run, 1 μL of cDNA was 
used as template for amplification per reaction. RT-PCR was 
performed using reactions containing a mixed cDNA tem-
plate, representing a combination of different tissues exa-
mined.  RT-PCR  amplification  for  functional  genes  and  a 
housekeeping gene was carried out for 30 cycles of 94°C for 
3 minutes, 56‒60°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 3 minutes. As 
a standard control, G3PDH was amplified through RT-PCR in 
human tissues. PCR products were loaded on 1‒2% agarose 
gels and stained with ethidium bromide.

domains: a CCCTCT repeat, Alu-like domain, a GC-rich va-
riable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), and SINE-R de-
rived from the HERV-K LTR element [7-9, 21, 22]. They are 
flanked by target site duplications and terminate in a poly(A) 
tail (Fig. 1). In genomic sequence analysis, SVA elements are 
present in G + C-rich regions; however, they do not have any 
preferences for inter- or intragenic regions. SVA families are 
separated  into  six  subfamilies  (SVA-A  to  SVA-F),  based 
upon  point  mutation  and  insertion  and  deletion  events 
within  the  SINE-R  [22].  Among  them,  four  subfamilies 
(SVA-A, SVA-B, SVA-C, SVA-D) are present in gibbons and 
orangutans, while two subfamilies (SVA-E and SVA-F) are 
restricted to the human lineage [22]. 

SVA elements residing in genes are potentially disruptive 
in either orientation. Approximately 1/3 of all SVA elements 
in the human genome reside in genic regions, with 20% of 
those SVA elements being in the same orientation as a gene 
[23]. As shown in Fig. 2, we analyzed the genomic structure 
of  SVA  fusion  genes  using  bioinformatic  tools  (Repeat-
Masker program and University of California, Santa Cruz 
[UCSC] genome browser). SVA elements are detected in the 
5'UTR  of  the  HGSNAT  (SVA-B,  AK_057293),  MRGPRX3 

(SVA-D,  NM_054031.2),  HYAL1  (SVA-F,  NM_153281), 
TCHH  (SVA-F,  AK_307946),  and  ATXN2L  (SVA-F,  AY_ 
188334-8) genes, while some elements are observed in the 
3'UTR of the SPICE1 (SVA-B, NM_144718), TDRKH (SVA- 
C,  AK_225160),  GOSR1  (SVA-D,  NM_001007024),  BBS5 
(SVA-D, NM_1523842), NEK5 (SVA-D, NM_199289; AK_ 
126330), ABHD2 (SVA-F, NM_007011), C1QTNF7 (SVA-F, 
NM_031911.3),  ORC6L  (SVA-F,  AK_024077.1),  TMEM69 
(SVA-F,  NM_016486.2),  and  CCDC137  (SVA-F,  NM_ 
199287.2)  genes.  Within  the  genic  region,  SVA  elements 
seem  to  prefer  the  3'UTR  compared  to  another  regions. 
Recently, a novel promoter derived from the SVA-D element 
was identified in the 5'UTR of the TBPL2 gene (DB089735) 
[19]. In order to understand whether the SVA element could 
act  as  a  transcriptional  regulator  or  not,  the  functional 
activity  of  the  PARK7  SVA  element  was  performed,  sug-
gesting that the SVA with the SINE-R region deleted showed 
significant  activity  to  enhance  reporter  gene  activity  in 
SK-N-AS  and  MCF-7  cells  [24].  Likewise,  we  have  also 
demonstrated the activity of an alternative promoter by the 
HERV-H LTR element in the human GSDML gene [25]. The 
transcripts of the LTR-derived promoter were widely dis-

tributed in various tissues, whereas the transcripts of the 
original promoter were found in stomach tissues, compared 
to those of various human tissues [25]. A human-specific 
solitary  LTR  element  (L47334)  was  previously  shown  to 
have enhancer activity in Tera-1 human testicular carcinoma 
cells [26]. The varying genetic structure of the alternative 
promoter or enhancer results in different functional effects 
[27].  Those  events  could  regulate  alternative  transcript 
variants,  resulting  in  the  production  of  different  protein 
isoforms [28]. In the case of leptin receptor isoform 219.1, 
SVA sequences form the C-terminal coding exon. Using the 

SVA-specific probe, Southern blot analysis in hominoids and 
Old World monkeys was performed, indicating that it was 
found to be a human-specific SVA element [29]. Further-
more,  new  exons  are  generated  from  intronic  retro-
transposons or the elements inserts into the exon, leading to 
a new transcript [30]. In the present study, the LEPR (SVA-C, 
NM_001003680),  ALOX5  (SVA-D,  AB_208946),  PDS5B 
(SVA-D, AK_128502.2), and ABCA10 (SVA-F, AL_832004) 
genes showed alternative transcripts by the SVA exonization 
event. To investigate the supply of alternative splicing sites at 
SVA  elements,  we  analyzed  related  splicing  sites  using

human genomic sequences (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Fig. 
3).  In  the  case  of  ABCA10  (AL832004)  genes,  the  SVA 
element provided both a splicing donor and acceptor site for 
the cassette exon. In the case of the ALOX5 (AB208946) and 
PDS5B  (AK128502)  genes,  the  SVA  element  provided  a 
splicing donor site for alternative 5' splicing. Conversely, the 
LEPR (NM001003680) gene was provided a splicing accep-
tor site for alternative 3' splicing. These phenomena con-
formed  to  the  canonical  splicing  site.  Also,  the  PDS5B 
(AK128502) and ABCA10 (AL832004) genes induced exo-
nization by providing alternative splicing sites in the VNTR 
region  of  SVA  elements.  Exonization  of  the  LEPR 
(NM001003680) and ALOX5 (AB208946) genes occurred by 
the SINE-R region of SVA elements. This integration event 
of  SVA  elements  into  the  exon  or  intron  causes  the 
promotion of transcriptional variants of functional genes. In 
WDR66  (NM_144668),  the  SVA-F  element,  inserted  in 
intron  19,  could  produce  human-specific  transcripts  that 
spliced  to  the  last  three  exons  [19].  Those  transcripts, 
derived from SVA elements, could have important biological 
function  in  humans,  therefore  deserving  further  investi-
gation in various tissues of hominoid primates.

SVA  elements  are  capable  of  generating  individual 
variation in gene expression at loci in which they are present. 
RT-PCR amplification could be a good indicator to detect 
alternative variants derived from SVA elements. As shown in 
Fig. 4, dominant expression of HYAL1_SVA appeared in lung 
tissues, while HYAL1_noSVA showed ubiquitous expression 
in  various  human  tissues.  Expression  of  both  transcripts

by the BioGPS database. Transcripts of the TCHH and HYAL1 
genes appeared dominant in placenta and liver, respectively. 
The  ALOX5  gene  showed  dominant  expression  in  whole

gene appeared in testis and prostate tissues, whereas the

tous expression (Fig. 5). SVA elements are nonautonomous 
retrotransposons that cause diseases in humans, and they 
are  mobilized  in  trans  by  active  L1  elements.  The  quan-
titative  real-time  polymerase  chain  reaction  analysis  of 
fukutin  mRNA  in  lymphoblasts  from  FCMD  patients 
indicated that the disease results from SVA-E insertion in 
the  3'UTR  of  the  FUKUTIN  gene.  Sequence  data  demon-
strated an abnormal splicing event by the integration of an 
SVA-E element [18]. In the case of the PMS2 gene, SVA-F has 
inserted in intron 7, and causes Lynch syndrome. Sequence 
analysis  of  the  RT-PCR  product  revealed  a  71-bp  SVA-F 
element  between  PMS2  exon  7  and  8  in  the  aberrant 
transcripts [31]. Exon 3 of the PNPLA2 gene was interrupted 
by  a  1.8-kb  SVA-F  insertion,  which  causes  lipid  storage 
disease  with  subclinical  myopathy  [32],  while  an  SVA-F 
element  inserted  in  intron  1  of  the  ARH  gene  causes 
hypercholesterolemia [33]. Taken together, alternative pro-
moter, enhancer, polyadenylation, and exonization events by 
SVA  elements  cause  various transcript isoforms and evo-
lutionary  dynamics  that  contribute  to  flexibility  in  the 
regulation  of  gene  expression  and  hominoid  radiation, 
including human disease.
