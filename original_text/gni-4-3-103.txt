Abstract 
IL-2BRA  is  one  of the  important  candidate  genes  for 
complex trait of genetic diseases, but there are only a few 
published results for this gene. Previously, we identified 
eighteen SNPs and two variation sites in the entire coding 
regions  of  IL-28RA  including  promoter  regions,  and 
suggested that the g.32349G>A polymorphism of /L-28RA 
might be associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis. 
In this study, we chose seven SNPs (g.-11 93A>C, g. -30C> T, 
g.17654C>T,  g.27798A>G,  g.31265C>T,  g.31911C>T and 
g.32349G>A) of IL-28RA, and attempted to find out whether 
these  polymorphisms  were  furtherassociated  with  genetic 
predisposition of asthma. We analyzed the genotype and 
allele frequencies of IL -28RA polymorph isms between the 
asthma  patients  and  healthy  controls.  We  also 
investigated the frequencies of haplotype constructed by 
these SNPs between asthma patients and controls. Our 
results suggest that the polymorphisms of /L-28RA gene 
were not associated with susceptibility to asthma, and not 
with  lgE  production  and  eosinophil  recruitment.  The 
haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also not significantly 
associated between the healthy controls and asthma patients. 
This result indicates that the IL -28RA polyrnorphisrns might 
be not associated withasthma susceptibility.

Introduction 
Asthma  is  one  of  the  most  common  multi-complex 
disorders  that  triggered  by  genetic  predisposition  and 
environmental  factors  (Cookson,  2002).  Unlike  other 
inflammatory  diseases,,  the  asthmatic  inflammatory 
process is characterized oy the predominant secretion of 
interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 by T-helper lymphocyte type 2 
(Th2) and immunoglobulin E (lgE) synthesis.lgE mediates 
early and late asthmatic responses in an induction of lung 
eosinophil  infiltration  and  Th2  cell  cytokine  production 
(Coyle  et  a/.,  1996).  Mast  cells  are  lgE-dependently 
activated, while eosinophils and basophils are recruited 
into the site of allergic reaction (Daser eta/., 1995; O'Garra, 
1998). The accumulation of eosinophils is an  important 
characteristicfeature  in  the  pathogenesis  of  asthma, 
because  it  accompanied  by  inflammation  within  the 
bronchial wall  (Humbles eta/., 1997). 

Cytokines  are  multifunctional  proteins  that  mediate 
many of responses  of innate and  adaptive immunities. 
They are produced in response to microbes, antigens, and 
other cytokines and stimulatediverse responses of cells 
involved in immunity and inflammation. They act on target 
cells  by  binding  to  specific cytokine  receptor,  initiating 
signal transduction and second signal pathways within the 
target cell  (Hibi  and  Hirano,  1998;  Onishi  et a/.,  1998; 
O'Shea eta/., 2002). The SNPs of many cytokines and their 
receptor  genes,  such  as  /L-10,  /L-12,  IFNy,  RANTES, 
CCR2 and CCR5, are identified (Gibson eta/., 2001; Hall 
et a/.,  2000;  Iwasaki  et a/.,  2001) and  indicate that the 
polymorphisms  are  associated  with  immune  disorders 
(Fryer eta/.,  2000;  Nakao eta/.,  2001 ).  We previously 
reported that the polymorphisms of eotaxin gene family 
(eotaxin, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3) and the exon 4 variation 
of Tim-1  are associated with asthma in Korean population 
(Chae eta/., 2003; Chae eta/., 2004). 

The new cytokine family consisting of interleukin 28A 
(IL-28A; also designated as IFN-y2), IL-288 (IFN-y3) and 
IL-29 (IFN-y1) and a component of their receptors, IL-28RA 
(IFN-yR1 ),  are  identified  from  the  human  genomic 
sequence (Dumoutier eta/., 2003; Kotenko eta/., 2003; 
Sheppard eta/., 2003). They are distantly related to type 
I interferons (IFNs) and the IL-10 family, and induced by 
viral infection and show antiviral activity (Sheppard eta/., 
2003;  Kotenko eta/.,  2003).  However,  IL-28 and  IL-29 

1 04  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 4(3) 103-109, September 2006 

interact with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that 
consist of IL-10 receptor~ (IL-10R~) and an orphan class 
II receptor chain, designated IL-28RA. Recently, Durnoutier 
and  co-workers  suggested  that  IL-29  induced  STAT2 
tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated through tyrosines 343 
and 517 of the I L -28RA and these two tyrosines are also 
responsible for antiviral and anti- proliferative activities of 
IL-29. In contrast, STAT4 phosphorylation is independent 
from IL-28RA tyrosine residues (Dumoutier eta/., 2004). 
IL-28RAgenes are  located  on  the chromosomal  region 
1 p36.11  and have seven exons. 

More recently,  we identified eighteen SNPs and two 
variation sites in human IL-28RA gene and reported that 
the  g.32349G>A  polymorphism  of  /L-28RA  might  be 
associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis (Chae et 
a/., 2006). In an attempt to better understand the genetic 
influences of IL-28RA on allergic disease such as asthma, 
we analyzed  the genotype frequencies  of the SNPs  in 
IL-28RA  in  the  genomic  DNAs  isolated  from  asthma 
patients and healthy controls to determine whether these 
IL-28RA SNPs are associated with asthma susceptibility. 
We further investigated  the relationships  among these 
polymorphisms  to  lgE  levels  and  peripheral  blood 
eosinophil counts in asthma patients. 

Materials and Methods 
Patients and DNA Samples 
On the basis of approval and informed consent from the 
review  board  of  School  of  Medicine,  Wonkwang 
University, blood samples were obtained from 280 asthma 
patients ( 146 males and  134 females) and  559 healthy 
non-asthma controls (346 males and 213 females). The 
mean ages of asthma patients and healthy controls were 
about 50.5 and 40.8 years respectively.  Genomic DNA 
was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral  blood by a 
standard phenol- chloroform method or by Genomic DNA 
Extraction kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea) according to 
manufacturer's directions. The asthma (atopic and non-atopic) 
patients were recruited from our outpatient clinic at Chonbuk 
National  University Hospital. Asthma was diagnosed in 
reference to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society 
(American Thoracic Society, 1987). The healthy controls 
were  recruited  from  the  general  population  and  had 
undergone a  comprehensive  medical  screening  at the 
Wonkwang University Hospital. All subjects employed in 
this study were Korean who is living in the same area. Blood 
eosinophil  counts and  total  serum  lgE levels in asthma 
patients were measured, at the Department of Hematology 
of Chonbuk National University Hospital, using a Coulter 
GenSTM Hematology Analyzer (Florida, USA) and Roche 

COBAS-CORE II (Roche Diagnostics, Basal, Switzerland), 
respectively. 

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
The entire coding  regions of /L-28RA  including -2.0 kb 
promoter regions were partially amplified by PCR using 
the six primer pairs,  and  PCR reactions were prepared 
by  previously  described  condition  (Chae  et a/.,  2006). 
Amplification was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 
9700  thermocycler  (PE  Applied  Biosystem,  USA)  at 
94 oc for 2 minutes, followed by 10 cycles at 94 oc for 10 
seconds,  68°C or 45 seconds  (2  minutes for promoter 
and exon 1 region, and 4 minutes for exon 7 and 3' UTR 
region),  and  68°C  for  10  minutes.  Then  20  cycles  at 
94oC for 10 seconds, 68°C for 45 seconds and 68oC or 
10 minutes (with  10 seconds incremental increases per 
cycle) were followed  by a final  extension  at 68oC  for 7 
minutes. 

Single-base extension (SBE) 
Genotyping  for  g.-1193A>C,  g.-30C>T,  g.17654C>T, 
g.27798A>G, g.31265C>T, g.31911C>Tandg.32349G>A 
in  the  IL-28RA  gene  was  performed  by  single-base 
extension (SSE) method (Chae eta/., 2006) using the ABI 
Prism® SNaPshot™ Multiplex kit (Applied  Biosystems). 
The  PCR  products  purified  by  PCR  purification  kit 
(Millipore,  USA)  were  used  as  the  template  DNA  for 
genotyping. The SSE reaction mix was prepared according 
to previously described method (Chae eta/., 2005). The 
primer extension  reaction was performed at 96°C for 1 
minute, followed by 25 cycles at 96oC for 10 seconds, 55°C 
for 40 seconds, and 60°C for 30 seconds. To clean up the 
primer extension reaction,  1.5 unit of CIP (Promega) was 
added  to  the  reaction  mixture,  and  the  mixture  was 
incubated at 3rC for 90 minutes, followed by 15 minutes 
at 72°C for purposes of enzyme inactivation. The purified 
extension  products  were  added  to  Hi-Di  formamide 
(Applied Biosystems) according to the recommendations 
of the manufacturer. The mixture was incubated at 95oc 
for  5  minutes,  followed  by  5  minutes  on  ice,  and  then 
electrophoresis was performed, using the ABI Prism 3100 
Genetic Analyzer. The results were analyzed using the ABI 
Prism  GeneScan  and  Genotyper  software  (Applied 
Biosystems ). 

Statistic analysis 
The  allergic  rhinitis  patients  and  non-allergic  rhinitis 
controls were compared using case-control association 
analyses. The x2 tests were used to estimate the Hardy(cid:173)
Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Logistic regression analyses 

/L-28RA Polymorphisms in Asthma  105 

were  used  to  calculate  odds  ratios  (95%  confidence 
interval}  for  SNP  sites.  Linkage  Disequilibrium  (LD} 
analyses by pair-wise comparison of biallelic loci and the 
haplotype frequencies of IL-28RA for multiple loci were 
estimated  using  the  expectation  maximization  (EM) 
algorithm with SNPAiyze software (DYNACOM, Japan). 
The  haplotype  analyses  of  IL-28RA  SNPs  between 
asthma patients and control were performed by Permutation 
test. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate 
statistical significance. 

Results and Discussion 

In response to different cytokine profiles, T helper cells are 
classified  into Th1  and  Th2  subsets.  Th1  cells  secrete 
cytokines (including IFN-y, IL-2 and TNF-~) and they join 
in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. On the other 

hand,  Th2  cells  produce  IL-4,  IL-5,  IL-10  and  IL-13. 
Eventually, they promote antibody production and control 
extracellular pathogens (Ho and Glimcher, 2002). Th1!fh2 
balance is very important in maintaining the healthy state 
of body. When the balance is altered, some disorders (such 
as asthma and RA) would occur. Th1  and Th2 cells can 
mutually antagonize the differentiation of the counterpart 
subset (Lafaille et at., 1997)./L-28RA is recently identified 
from the human genomic sequence as a component of their 
receptors for the new cytokine consisting of /L -28A,  /L -288 
and  /L-29 (Sheppard eta/., 2003;  Kotenko eta/., 2003). 
Although IL-28RA is one of the important candidate genes 
for complex trait of genetic diseases, there are only a few 
published results for this gene. Previously, we identified 
eighteen SNPs and two variation sites in the entire coding 
regions  of  /L-28RA  including  promoter  regions,  and 
suggested that the g.32349G>A polymorphism of IL-28RA

might be associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis, 
but seems to have no relationship with  serum total  lgE 
levels.  The haplotype frequencies  by these  SNPs also 
show significant association between controls and allergic 
rhinitis patients. 

In our present study, we attempted to find out whether 
these polymorph isms of IL -28RA were further associated 
with genetic predisposition of another allergic disease such 
as  asthma.  We  analyzed  the  genotype  and  allele 
frequencies  of  IL-28RA  polymorphisms  between  the 
asthma  patients  and  healthy  controls.  The  genotype 
frequencies  of all  loci  were  in  HWE  (P>0.05,  data  not 
shovln1 ). The genotype and allele frequendes of polymorphisms 
in asthma patients were not significantly different from those 

in the controls group (Table  1).  This result suggests the 
polymorphisms  of  IL-28RA  are  not  associated  with 
susceptibility to asthma. We further analyzed the genotype 
and allele frequencies of atopic asthma, non-atopic asthma 
patients and healthy controls. In both atopic and non-atopic 
asthma patients,  the genotype and  allele frequencies of 
IL-28RA polymorphism, were not significantly different from 
the frequencies of healthy control  group (Table 2).  This 
result indicates that the polymorphism of IL-28RA might 
be not associated with susceptibility of atopic disease. 

Eosinophil is accumulated in high numbers in the lungs 
of asthmatic patients and  is  believed  to  be essential  in 
phagocytosis as well as in allergic and inflammatory reactions 
of asthma. Therefore, the number of accumulated eosinophils

within the bronchial wall is a characteristic feature of asthma 
(Humbles eta/., 1997). N.least, a dozen of polymorphic genes 
have been estimated that regulate asthma by controlling the 
inflammatory response, total serum immunoglobulin E (lgE), 
cytokines and chemokines (Cookson,  1999). However, our 
results reveal the polymorph isms of /L -28RA gene in asthma 
patients are not closely associated with the level of total 
serum lgE, the peripheral blood eosinophil count, FVC and 
FEV1  (Table  3).  We  also  calculated  the  haplotype fre(cid:173)
quencies among  g.-30C>T,  g.17654C>T,  g.27798A>G 
and  g.32349G>A  in  both  healthy controls  and  asthma 

patients.  While  the  most  major  haplotype  (20.3%  of 
distributions) in healthy control was TCGG, the most major 
haplotype (22.5% of distributions) was TCAG in asthma 
patients (Table 4 ). The distribution of haplotype TCAG and 
TI AG were significantly different between the controls and 
asthma patients (P=0.039 and P = 0.023, respectively). But 
the frequency of haplotype TIAG was low in both group, 
and the haplotype TCAG corrected by bonferroni correction 
also not significantly associated.  These results suggest 
that the haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also not 
significantly associated between the healthy controls and 

1 08  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 4(3) 103-109, September 2006 

asthma patients. 

In this study, our results suggest that the polymorph isms 
of IL-28RA gene were not associated with susceptibility 
to asthma,  and  not with  lgE  production  and  eosinophil 
recruitment.  The haplotype frequencies by these SNPs 
also not significantly  associated  between  controls  and 
asthmapatients.  Our  study  is  the  first  analysis  about 
IL -28RA SNPs in asthma, and may contribute to the future 
study on the IL-28RA functions and association studies 
with other allergic, atopic or infectious disease.
