Genome-wide association studies have proven the highly polygenic architecture of complex diseases or traits; therefore, 
single-locus-based methods are usually unable to detect all involved loci, especially when individual loci exert small effects. 
Moreover, the majority of associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms resides in non-coding regions, making it difficult to 
understand their phenotypic contribution. In this work, we studied epistatic interactions associated with three common 
diseases using Korea Association Resource (KARE) data: type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and coronary artery 
disease (CAD). We showed that epistatic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were enriched in enhancers, as well as in 
DNase  I  footprints  (the  Encyclopedia  of  DNA  Elements  [ENCODE]  Project  Consortium  2012),  which  suggested  that  the 
disruption of the regulatory regions where transcription factors bind may be involved in the disease mechanism. Accordingly, 
to identify the genes affected by the SNPs, we employed whole-genome multiple-cell-type enhancer data which discovered 
using DNase I profiles and Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE). Assigned genes were significantly enriched in known disease 
associated gene sets, which were explored based on the literature, suggesting that this approach is useful for detecting 
relevant affected genes. In our knowledge-based epistatic network, the three diseases share many associated genes and are 
also closely related with each other through many epistatic interactions. These findings elucidate the genetic basis of the 
close relationship between DM, HT, and CAD.

Introduction

Recent  data  have  shown  the  inextricable  relationship 
between diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT), and 
coronary artery disease (CAD). For instance, approximately 
70%  of  patients  with  DM  reported  being  affected  by  HT, 
which is about twice as common in patients with DM as in 
those without it [1]. Furthermore, patients with both DM 
and  HT  were  reported  to  have  double  the  risk  for  CAD, 
which is the most prevalent cause of morbidity in type 1 or 
type  2  DM  [2].  However,  the  underlying  genetic  contri-
butions driving the increased prevalence of HT and CAD in 
diabetic patients are poorly understood.

There have been many studies seeking to understand the 

mechanisms  of  complex  traits  using  a  single-locus-based 
approach, but they have not been capable of explaining their 
complicated  genetic  effects.  Instead,  it  is  necessary  to 
consider  the  joint  genetic  effects  produced  through  the 
simultaneous perturbation of epistatically interacting vari-
ants. Consequently, epistasis is now increasingly assumed to 
be an important factor in demonstrating complex disease, 
and there are many studies in which evidence of epistasis has 
been found [3].

Unfortunately, in spite of such efforts, most such studies 
usually have been conducted in a European descent cohort 
[4] and have not included any Asian patients. In this work, 
we  performed  a  genomewide  epistasis  analysis  using  the 
East Asian cohort from Korea Association Resource (KARE) 
data. This is meaningful work, because obvious differences

exist between ethnically diverse populations, such as sus-
ceptibility  genes,  allele  frequency,  and  linkage  disequili-
brium (LD) structure.

Most genetic variants associated with complex disease are 
usually located in non-coding genomic regions, and many 
studies have suggested that such variants might be involved 
in a transcriptional regulatory role [5]. In this regard, when 
building  an  appropriate  model,  it  can  be  very  limiting  to 
assign affected genes using only the nearest ones. For sys-
tematic annotation, therefore, we have suggested extensive 
non-coding variant annotation using regulatory elements, 
including promoters and distal enhancers. In this work, we 
illustrate  how  this  annotation  method  can  be  used  to 
establish a reasonable genetic model in complex diseases.

Methods
KARE data

We used 352,228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
genotyped  using  Affymetrix  Genomewide  Human  SNP 
Array 5.0 (genomic coordinates hg18; Affymetrix Inc., Santa 
Clara,  CA,  USA)  for  8,842  Korean  individuals  from  the 
KARE project. We converted hg18 to hg19 using the liftOver 
tool from UCSC (http://genome. ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver) 
and converted Affymetrix ID to dbSNP reference cluster ID 
using  the  annotation  file  offered  by  Affymetrix  (http:// 
affymetrix.com). In this study, we focused on DM, HT, and 
CAD  (myocardial  infarction  and  CAD)  and  considered 
people who did not have any disease as the controls (Table 
1).

Epistasis detection using GPU-based Boolean 
Operation-based Screening and Testing

We applied GPU-based Boolean Operation-based Screen-
ing and Testing (GBOOST) to analyze epistatic interaction 
effects  from  the  genomewide  SNP  data  [6].  Stage  I: 
screening—in  the  screening  stage,  BOOST  evaluated  all 
pairwise  interactions  using  the  Kirkwood  superposition 
approximation. Stage 2: testing—pairs of epistatic loci with 
PBOOST  ≤ 4.89e-06  were  further  evaluated  by  a  logistic 
regression model to compute interaction effects [7]. After 
that,  GBOOST  conducted  a  2  test  with  four  degrees  of

freedom  (df  =  4)  and  calculated  p-values  to  determine 
whether the interaction effect was significant. The numbers 
of interactions tested were 226,507, 251,344, and 151,090 in 
DM,  HT,  and  CAD,  respectively;  thus,  the  genome-wide 
significance  levels  were  4.41e-08,  3.98e-08,  and  6.62e-08 
using Bonferroni correction.

Enrichment of epistatic SNPs in regulatory elements

To test for the enrichment of epistatic SNPs (Table 2) in 
regulatory elements, we overlapped SNPs with enhancers 
(see  below)  and  footprints  data.  We  obtained  genomic 
DNase I footprints across 41 cell types from the Encyclopedia 
of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project (The ENCODE Project 
Consortium  2012;  http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODDE/ 
downloads.html). Nucleotide resolution analysis of DNase I 
cleavage patterns allowed us to discover the footprints of 
where the transcription factor bound [8].

To  determine  whether  the  observed  count  was  signifi-
cantly greater than expected by chance, we randomly select-
ed 7,967 variants (the same number of epistatic SNPs) from 
dbSNPs  (59,180,134  autosomal  SNPs)  and  repeated  the 
overlap  analysis  1,000  times.  The  level  of  significance 
(p-value) was computed as the proportion of counts that 
were equal to or larger than the observed count from the null 
distribution.

Target gene mapping to SNPs using regulatory 
elements

We used all transcript annotations from GENCODE.v19, 
which contains 20,242 protein-coding genes. The promoter 
was  defined  as  the  region  1.5  kb  upstream  of  the  trans-
cription start site of a gene. When a SNP was in the promoter 
region of a gene, we assigned the gene to the SNP.

In  the  case  of  SNPs  that  were  not  assigned  using  the 
promoter, we assigned genes using the enhancer that was 
connected with the promoter of the target gene. We obtained 
genomewide multiple-cell-type enhancer data from previous 
studies [9, 10]. Maurano et al. [9] identified distal enhancer- 
to-promoter connections using DNase I profiles across 349 
diverse  cell  types,  and  Andersson  et  al.  [10]  identified

using Cap Analysis Gene Expression (CAGE) data based on 
the  FANTOM5  panel  of  ∼400  distinct  cell  types.  We

proxy 
tool  (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/) 
[11].  The  summary  of  the  number  of  assigned  genes  is 
shown in Table 3.

mation  from  Phenopedia  (HuGE  Navigator,  version  2.0)

To test whether the genes we discovered were statistically 
enriched  within  known  genes  involving  the  disease,  we 
calculated the p-value using the hyper-geometric test:

Results

In  the  KARE  dataset,  there  were  substantial  overlaps 
between the cases of DM, HT, and CAD (Fig. 1). We found 
that the occurrence of one disease was largely dependent on 
another. For example, the incidence of HT was significantly 
associated  with  CAD  (odds  ratio,  2.39;  95%  confidence 
interval [CI], 1.64 to 3.48; p = 4.29e-06). Similarly, the odds 
ratio of incident DM for HT versus normal was 2.15 (95% CI, 
1.79 to 2.56; p = 2.20e-16), and the odds ratio of CAD for 

DM was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.68; p = 2.82e-02) (Fig. 2).
We  analyzed  all  pairwise  interaction  effects  from  the 
KARE data using GBOOST. As the result, we detected 1,962, 
2,023, and 1,709 epistatic interactions in DM, HT, and CAD, 
respectively (Table 3). For a full list, see the Supplementary 
Tables  1–3.  We  overlapped  these  epistatic  SNPs  within 
genomic regions, including the promoter, gene distal region, 
intron,  and  exon.  (Fig.  2).  As  a  result,  the  majority  of 
detected epistatic SNPs was found to reside in non-coding 
regions, especially within introns and gene distal regions,

which are intergenic regions, excluding promoters.

Furthermore, we tested whether the epistatic SNPs were 
enriched  in  regulatory  element,  such  as  enhancers  and 
DNase  I  footprints  (Fig.  3).  We  identified  statistically 
significant enrichment of the SNPs in enhancer regions (p = 
0.001), as well as DNase I footprint regions (p ＜ 0.001). 
This suggests that the disruption of regulatory factor binding 
might be involved in the disease mechanism. For that reason, 
we  annotated  epistatic  SNPs  using  regulatory  element 
information, including promoters, as well as enhancers (see 
Methods).  We  also  proved  that  the  assigned  genes  were 
enriched in each known disease-associated gene set (Table 
3).

We  built  a  knowledge-based  epistatic  network.  We 
discovered that the diseases share many associated genes 
and also have a number of epistatic interactions within and 
between  genes  involved  in  each  disease  (Fig.  4).  For  a 
detailed list, see the Supplementary Table 4.

For example, we detected an epistatic interaction effect 
between  atypical  protein  kinase  C  isotype-specific  intera-
cting protein (ASIP) and hexokinase II (HK2) in DM. Pre-
vious  studies  have  reported  that  overexpression  of  ASIP 
inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake [13], and HK2 plays 
a central role in glucose metabolism [14]. Our result implies 
that  gene  pairs,  such  as  ASIP  and  HK2,  could  boost  the 
incidence  of  DM  through  epistatic  interactions.  We  also 
detected several significant epistatic interaction effects in 
CAD  and  HT  between  several  DM-associated  gene  pairs. 
This finding could provide a genetic basis for the increased 
prevalence of CAD and HT in diabetic patients.

Discussion

In  this  paper,  we  carried  out  a  genomewide  epistasis 
analysis to understand the comprehensive genetic relation-
ships between DM, HT, and CAD in a Korean cohort. For 
systematic  annotation,  we  employed  whole-genome  mul-
tiple-cell-type  enhancer  data,  because  the  majority  of 
detected epistatic SNPs was located in non-coding regions. 
Our enrichment analysis in regulatory DNA regions identi-
fied  substantial  variants  that  might  affect  transcriptional 
regulatory  function  through  disruptions  of  promoter  or 
enhancer  elements  where  regulatory  factors  bind.  We 
confirmed  that  the  genes  that  were  discovered  using  the 
non-coding  element  are  statistically  enriched  in  known 
genes  involved  in  the  diseases,  which  suggests  that  this 
annotation method is considerably relevant. We found that 
the diseases shared many associated genes, implying their 
inseparable relationship. A large number of epistatic inter-
actions  were  also  intricately  connected  between  genes 
involved in DM, HT, and CAD. This integrated map, based on 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

epistatic interactions, could provide a genetic basis for the 
underlying mechanisms of the increased prevalence of the 
diseases’  dependence  on  one  another.  In  conclusion,  our 
results  illustrate  how  extensive  non-coding  variant  anno-
tation based on chromatin interactions of distal enhancers 
can  be  used  to  dissect  complex  genetic  interactions  in 
complex diseases.
