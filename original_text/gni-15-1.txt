Clinical sequencing has become a part of medical practice. 
It is widely accepted that clinical sequencing is the main tool 
of precision medicine and can facilitate the selection of the 
right drug at right dose to the right patient at the right time. 
To reflect the importance of clinical sequencing, in this issue, 
Genomics  &  Informatics  opens  a  new  section,  termed 
‘Clinical Genomics’. Genomics & Informatics would like to 
encourage medical scientists to submit any type of clinical 
sequencing  data  if  they  have  potential  implications  in 
medical  practice  or  provide  biological  insights.  The  first 
paper in the Clinical Genomics section is on the successful 
detection  of  somatic  mutations  from  circulating  plasma 
DNA  of  a  breast  cancer  patient.  Dr.  Seung-Hyun  Jung’s 
group (The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medi-
cine, Korea) examined the mutation profile of primary tumor 
tissue from a breast cancer patient using a cancer panel that 
they  developed  and  identified  several  somatic  point 
mutations  and  copy  number  alterations.  They  examined 
whether the alterations identified from tumor tissue were 
consistently detected in plasma DNA isolated from the same 
patient and confirmed that both point mutations and copy 
number  alterations  were  consistently  identified  in  two 

sources. 

There are five original articles in this issue. Dr. Jong-Keuk 
Lee’s group (Ulsan University, Korea) evaluated digital PCR 
as  a  system  for  monitoring  graft  status  using  SNP-based 
detection of donor DNA in plasma or urine. They found that 
donor DNA was almost undetectable in plasma DNA sam-
ples, whereas a high percentage of donor DNA was detected 
in urine DNA samples. Therefore, they suggested that urine 
is a good source of cfDNA for monitoring acute rejection in 
patients after kidney transplantation. Dr. Seon-Young Kim’s 
group (KRIBB, Korea) developed a new ChIP-seq data an-
alysis pipeline, based on Bioconductor packages. They also 
developed  a  graph-based  database  and  reported  its  feasi-
bility. In the application note section, Dr. Ju Han Kim’s group 
(Seoul  National  University,  Korea)  proposed  an  R-based 
RNA-seq  analysis  pipeline  called  TRAPR,  which  is  an 
integrated  tool  that  facilitates  the  statistical  analysis  and 
visualization of RNA-seq expression data.
