As next-generation sequencing technologies have advanced, enormous amounts of whole-genome sequence information in 
various species have been released. However, it is still difficult to assemble the whole genome precisely, due to inherent 
limitations of short-read sequencing technologies. In particular, the complexities of plants are incomparable to those of 
microorganisms or animals because of whole-genome duplications, repeat insertions, and Numt insertions, etc. In this study, 
we describe a new method for detecting misassembly sequence regions of Brassica rapa with genotyping-by-sequencing,  
followed by MadMapper clustering. The misassembly candidate regions were cross-checked with BAC clone paired-ends 
library sequences that have been mapped to the reference genome. The results were further verified with gene synteny 
relations  between  Brassica  rapa  and  Arabidopsis  thaliana.  We  conclude  that  this  method  will  help  detect  misassembly 
regions and be applicable to incompletely assembled reference genomes from a variety of species.

Introduction

The  genomics  era  has  opened  in  earnest  with  the 
completion  of  the  Human  Genome  Project.  With  the 
development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techno-
logies,  the  amount  of  genomics  data  has  exploded,  and 
sequencing targets have become very diverse. As of 2017, 
there are 7,930 species of eukaryotes, 192,677 species of 
bacteria, and 1,412 species of archaea that have been offi-
cially registered in NCBI. As the Nagoya Protocol is initiated, 
it is expected that these numbers will continue to increase in 
the  future  due  to  the  policies  of  each  country  to  secure 
information on biological genetic resources [1, 2]. Despite 
the fact that the cost of genomic analysis is declining, there 
are still a number of technical problems that make it difficult 
to sequence the genome completely [3]. For example, misa-

ssembly due to the inherent limitations of NGS technology is 
well  known  [4-6].  Especially  in  plants,  there  are  many 
barriers that make plant genomes hard to sequencing, such 
as Numts, repeats, and genome duplication events [7-9].

Genotyping-by-sequencing  (GBS)  is  a  technology  that 
allows  high-throughput  genotyping  by  applying  NGS 
technology. It is used to analyze single nucleotide polymor-
phisms  (SNPs)  in  populations  to  find  molecular  markers 
that  are  related  to  phenotype  and  genotype  or  to  draw 
genetic linkage maps for plant breeding. By analyzing the 
pattern of GBS data along each chromosome, one can find 
out where the gene crossover occurs. On the other hand, a 
small block that interrupts an otherwise continuous GBS 
pattern is genetically non-ideal and implies a misassembled 
region. Therefore, we explored the application of GBS in the 
detection of misassemblies [10-12].

Brassicaceae is a mustard family containing 372 genera

and 4,060 accepted species, and its varieties are cultivated as 
economically valuable crops not only in East Asia but also 
globally  [13].  The  triangle  of  U  theory  states  that  the 
differentiation  of  an  allotetraploid  of  Brassica  species—
Brassica juncea (AABB), Brassica napus (AACC), and Brassica 
carinata  (BBCC)—occurs  due  to  the  polyploidization  of 
diploid  Brassica  species:  Brassica  rapa  (AA),  Brassica  nigra 
(BB), and Brassica oleracea (CC). This theory has been proven 
by  genomic  analysis  by  NGS  of  Brassica  species  [14-25]. 
Research on the correlation between the genetic information 
and  the  nutrient  content  of  crops  has  been  actively  con-
ducted in Brassica genomes [26]. The recently published B. 
rapa V2.1 genome sequence shows much improved quality, 
as well as a number of misassembly corrections over the 
previous  version,  V1.5  [17].  This  offers  an  interesting 
opportunity to test the potential of misassembly detection, 
based on GBS data.

In this study, we propose a user-friendly pipeline, called 
misMM, which automatically identifies misassembled can-
didate  blocks  (MCBs)  and  adjacent  to  destination  blocks 
(ADBs) and plots the genetic map of MCBs by using raw GBS 
data sorted by MadMapper [27]. These results are verified by 
using the BAC end-sequence library published in NCBI and 
the gene synteny relation between Arabidopsis thaliana and B. 
rapa [28-31].

Methods
Data source

The end sequences of B. rapa accession Chiifu-401-42, a 
Chinese cabbage BAC library (KBrH, KBrB, and KBrS), were 
downloaded  from  NCBI  and  used  to  verify  the  putative 
misassembly  genome  regions.  In  order  to  investigate  the 
gene synteny relation between A. thaliana TAIR10 and B. rapa 
genome  V1.5,  the  corresponding  general  feature  format 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

(GFF) annotation files and protein sequences of each species 
were  downloaded  from  http://ensemblgenomes.org  and 
http://brassicadb.org, respectively. The GBS data were pro-
duced by a previous study that investigated the correlation 
between flavonoid content and the genotype of B. rapa in 69 
individuals of a doubled haploid F2 generation obtained by 
microbial  culture  of  an  F1  generation  cross  of  two  sub-
species—yellow sarson of LP08 (B. rapa ssp. tricolaris) and 
pak  choi  of  LP21  (B.  rapa  ssp.  chinensis)—with  distinct 
morphologies  [26].  From  the  study,  genotype  data  were 
obtained at a total of 8,176 positions.

Configuration of the misMM pipeline for 
misassembled block detection

misMM,  a  pipeline  for  genome  misassembled  block 
detection, was written in a Linux shell and with Python ver. 
2.7  in-house  codes.  The  first  step  is  preprocessing:  after 
loading all GBS raw data files, markers with a missing value 
of over 8% were filtered out. If the neighboring positions had 
the similar GBS pattern with consistency, they were grouped 
into one block. Our script then automatically prepared the 
three  kinds  of  input  files  (.loc,  IDs,  and  maps)  for  Mad-
Mapper  (UC  Davis)  [27],  a  package  that  specializes  in 
recombinant  inbred  lines  analysis  using  large  genetic 
markers and easy visualizes the 2D pairwise matrix. The next 
step  is  the  linkage  grouping  and  block  shuffling  step, 
performed  with  MadMapper.  By  using  the  default  para-
meters of MadMapper_RECBIT (rec_cut, 0.2; bit_cut, 100; 
data_cut, 25; allele_dist, 0.33; missing_data, 50; trio_ana-
lysis, TRIO; double_cross, 3), linkage grouping and marker 
extraction were performed by generating a pairwise matrix 
between GBS patterns of each block. Subsequently, block 
shuffling was performed by MadMapper_XDELTA (marker 
fixation, FIXED; shuffle option, SHUFFLE; shuffle block, 6; 
shuffle step, 3) with each clustered block. At the end of this

process,  it  plotted  a  genetic  map  diagram  with  putative 
misassembled  blocks.  In  addition,  it  also  generated  2D 
heatmap graphs for comparing before and after the block 
shuffling. All of the work flow of this pipeline is described in 
Fig. 1. The misMM pipeline scripts can be downloaded from 
http://sskimbnas.ipdisk.co.kr:80/publist/HDD1/misMM/

Validation using BAC end sequences

In  order  to  confirm  the  misassembled  blocks  with 
experimental  data,  we  extracted  41,969  pairs  of  end 
sequences from the BAC libraries (KBrS, KBrH, and KBrB) of 
B. rapa and carried out sequence alignment against the B. 
rapa  reference  genome  sequence  using  Nucmer  (MUM-
mer3.23)  with  the  proper  options  (--maxmatch,  use  all 
anchor  matches;  -g,  global  alignment;  -I,  ＞95%;  -r,  sort 
output lines by reference). The Nucmer results were then 
filtered for discordant BAC end pairs with one end aligned to 
the MCB and the other end to the ADB.

Validation using gene synteny relation between A. 
thaliana and B. rapa

For validation with gene synteny, the protein sequence of 
B. rapa were matched to those of A. thaliana using BLASTP 
(Blast 2.2.26), and the top four hits for each query were 
retained. The tabulated results were then sorted, based on 
the  genomic  coordinates  of  each  protein,  and  the  gene 
synteny relation was examined manually.

Results and Discussion

misMM was developed to provide a streamlined and yet 
simple-to-use  pipeline  for  the  detection  of  misassembled 
regions, so-called MCBs, based on GBS data (Fig. 1). This 
pipeline was tested with the GBS data of B. rapa against the 
B. rapa V1.5 reference genome, which is known to have some 
misassembled regions compared to the recently published 
V2.1 genome [17]. The original linkage score heatmap that 
was  produced  by  MadMapper  showed  many  off-diagonal 
cells with a low score that were often clustered in stretch 
(Fig. 2 left panel). The off-diagonal blocks scoring less than 
0.33 were defined as MCBs (Table 1, Fig. 3). For each MCB, 
the corresponding ADB was identified by MadMapper, based 
on  the  linkage  score  (Table  1).  The  subsequent  shuffled 
heatmap  showed  clean  clustering,  with  no  low-scoring 
off-diagonal blocks, implying the unambiguousness of the 
GBS pattern in detecting misassemblies (Fig. 2 right panel). 
The MCBs and ADBs were distributed throughout the entire 
pseudomolecule. A total of 16 MCBs had an average block 
size of 65,477 bp, and the largest one was 410,190 bp. The 
average size of the ADBs was 746,707 bp, with a maximum 
of 4,936,893 bp. The fact that only a few small MCBs were 
detected and that the corresponding ADBs were large in size 
implies  that  the  B.  rapa  V1.5  genome  is  well  assembled 
overall but has a few problematic regions, as shown by the 
recent update of the genome [17]. 

We used two sets of data to validate that the ADBs were 
indeed in the neighboring area of the MCBs. The first one 
was used to find discordant BAC end pairs with one end

aligned to the MCB and the other end aligned to the ADB. For 
example, the MCB of block number 2 in Table 1 was located 
in  pseudomolecule  A01,  ranging  from  11,453,104  to 
11,488,588, while its corresponding ADBs were found in 
A04. Table 2 shows the mapping results of the six BAC end 
pairs of this block, the sizes of which ranged from 671 bp to 
1,000  bp,  with  a  mapping  identity  higher  than  97.93%. 
While  one  end  of  the  BAC  pairs  was  mapped  to  the 
corresponding  MCB  in  A01,  all  of  the  other  ends  were 

mapped  within  the  ADB,  ranging  from  3,271,457  to 
4,978,203 in A04. Likewise, 10 out of 16 blocks listed in 
Table 1 could be confirmed by the BAC end results. The true 
locations of these blocks could be estimated within the span 
of the corresponding BAC (average 110 kbp). The rest could 
not be confirmed, probably due to the distance between the 
MCB and ADB, making it incompatible with the BAC size.
The  other  validation  method  was  the  use  of  the  gene 
synteny relation. Compared to the A. thaliana genome, there

is  evidence  that  the  B.  rapa  genome  has  undergone  trip-
lication [32]. Accordingly, most of the A. thaliana genes are 
preserved in gene synteny blocks at three different places. 
Within block number 2 in Table 1, two B. rapa genes are 
annotated: Bra033489 and Bra033490 (Table 3). For all 16 
genes flanking these two genes, orthologs were identified by 
BLASTP (Table 4). Eight A. thaliana genes in the middle—
including  the  orthologs  of  two  genes,  AT4G14330  and 
AT4G14350—were out of order and broke the continuity of 
the synteny in the region. This is consistent with our finding 
that this MCB is truly misplaced in B. rapa genome V1.5. The 
true locations of the two B. rapa genes in this MCB can be 
inferred by mapping the flanking genes of AT4G14330 and 
AT4G14350 to the B. rapa genome (Table 5). Indeed, a total 
of six A. thaliana flanking genes were mapped to the B. rapa

pipeline.  Red  colors  indicate  misassembled  candidate  blocks.

orthologs that were found in the corresponding ADBs. As 
expected, the gene synteny of this region is also well pre-
served. In this way, we can estimate the approximate relative 
locations of these two genes. Based on this relationship, an 
analysis was carried out with regard to the relationship of the 
protein orthologs and gene coordination between the two 
species. First, two genes were annotated in an example block 
(Table  3).  When  these  two  genes  were  found  in  a  table 
arranged by the coordinates of the B. rapa gene, there was no 
continuity between the ortholog genes and the surrounding 
genes  (Table  4).  But,  when  we  sorted  this  based  on  the 
coordination of A. thaliana, the ortholog genes belonging to 
the  ADB  were  located  consecutively  around  the  gene 
belonging to the MCB (Table 5). Furthermore, the gene order 
that was inferred here was confirmed in the updated B. rapa 
V2.1 genome that was recently published [17].

In recent years, studies of expression quantitative trait loci 
that affect mRNA expression or protein expression using 
SNPs and studies to find markers that affect the environ-
mental  adaptation  of  plants  have  been  becoming  widely 
embraced [33]. For such works, accurate reference genome 
assembly is required. Toward that goal, our misMM pipeline 
is a useful tool for the identification of misassemblies in 
complex genomes using GBS data.
