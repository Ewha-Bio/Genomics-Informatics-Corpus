Sequencing depth, which is directly related to the cost and time required for the generation, processing, and maintenance 
of  next-generation  sequencing  data,  is  an  important  factor  in  the  practical  utilization  of  such  data  in  clinical  fields. 
Unfortunately, identifying an exome sequencing depth adequate for clinical use is a challenge that has not been addressed 
extensively. Here, we investigate the effect of exome sequencing depth on the discovery of sequence variants for clinical use. 
Toward this, we sequenced ten germ-line blood samples from breast cancer patients on the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a 

high depth of ∼200×. We observed that  most function-related  diverse variants in  the  human exonic regions could be 

detected at a sequencing depth of 120×. Furthermore, investigation using a diagnostic gene set showed that the number of 
clinical variants  identified  using exome  sequencing  reached  a  plateau  at  an  average  sequencing  depth of  about  120×. 
Moreover, the phenomena were consistent across the breast cancer samples.

Introduction

Exome capture sequencing (simply referred to as "exome 
sequencing") is a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based 
technique  which  targets  the  genomic  sequences  of  pro-
tein-coding regions ("exomes") of a species [1]. Although 
protein-coding  regions  constitute  only  1%  of  the  human 
genome,  they  harbor  85%  of  the  mutations  that  have 
significant effects on disease-related traits [2]. Therefore, 
exome sequencing is a potential contributor to the under-
standing of diverse human diseases [2].

With a dramatic decrease in the cost and time required for 
the generation of sequences with high accuracy [3], exome 

sequencing is now widely used to understand many genetic 
diseases. For example, in the Netherlands, exome sequencing 
of ten blood samples from patients with severe intellectual 
disabilities allowed the identification of five new candidate 
genes associated with such disabilities [4]. Further, Ng et al. 
[1] sequenced the exomes of twelve human samples with or 
without Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (FSS), which is a rare 
dominantly inherited disorder, and observed an association 
between the MYH3 gene was responsible for FSS. Furthermore, 
Huh et al. [5] used exome sequencing to show that the c.234 
G  ＞ A  and  c.1150C  ＞ T  mutations  in  exon  18  of  the 
HGSNAT  gene  were  common  in  mucopolysaccharide 
patients. Exome sequencing techniques have also been used 
to understand the risks of various cancers, including those of

the  breast  [6,  7],  prostate  [8],  pancreas  [9],  and  others 
[10-12].  Therefore,  exome  sequencing  techniques  have 
become  a  new  primary  paradigm  for  research  on  genetic 
diseases and cancers. 

One important issue that needs to be addressed for the 
clinical  utilization  of  NGS-based  sequencing  data  is  the 
adequate depth of sequencing. Sequencing depth is directly 
related  to  the  cost  and  time  required  for  the  generation, 
processing, and maintenance of sequencing data [13]. In this 
vein, several studies have been performed to investigate the 
impact of sequencing depth on NGS data intended to identify 
genomic variants. For example, Hou et al. [14] investigated 
the  discovery  rates  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  and  structural  variants  in  healthy  samples  using 
whole genome sequencing (WGS) at an average sequencing 
depth of 180×. They observed that most of the variations 
were identified at an average depth of 100×. Meanwhile, 
Ajay et al. [15] calculated the genome coverage and discovery 
rates of variants in healthy samples using WGS data at 100× 
average mapped depth. The callable portion of the genome 
was 90% at a depth of 40×, and that of the protein-coding 
exome region was about 88% at a depth of 100×. However, 
these studies analyzed sequencing data derived from healthy 
individuals;  the  adequate  depth  required  to  discover 
clinically significant variations still needs to be addressed.

In this study, we investigated for the first time the effect of 
exome  sequencing  depth  on  the  discovery  of  genomic 
variations for clinical use. Toward this, we performed exome 
sequencing  in  ten  germ-line  blood  samples  from  breast 
cancer patients using the Illumina platform GAII(x) at a high 
depth of  ∼200×. We also checked the discovery rates of 
diverse  variations  as  a  function  of  the  sequencing  depth, 
using total and diagnostic gene sets.

Methods
Samples and sequencing

Total ten subjects were included in this study. They were 
enrolled from the Seoul National University Hospital and 
Seoul National University Bundang Hospital in Korea. They 
were all diagnosed with breast cancer, with a history of two 
or more affected family members and/or other risk factors, 
like bilateral breast cancer or young age of onset. Exome 
capture was carried out with the blood samples of the ten 
subjects using Agilent exome capture kits (SureSelect V2) 
and sequencing was performed on the (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA).

Sequence alignment and variant calling

University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/),  using  BWA  (bwa-0.6.2)  [16] 
with default parameters and a seed length of 45 bp. The 
Sequence  Alignment  and  Mapping  (SAM)  files  were 
converted  to  Binary  Alignment and Mapping (BAM)  files 
using SAMtools [17]. Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) 
was used to mark and remove the polymerase chain reaction 
duplicates  detected  from  the  BAM  files.  The  Genome 
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [18] was then used for base quality 
recalibration  and  local  realignment  around  the  potential 
indel  sites. The  UnifiedGenotyper [19] in the GATK was 
used in the final step for variant calling using a Bayesian 
model.  Variants  were  filtered  by  three  types  of  filtering 
methods:  (1)  HARD_TO_VALIDATE:  MQ0  ≥4  and 
[(MQ0/(1.0 × DP)] ＞0.1; (2) QualFilter: QUAL ＜10; and 
(3) Additional: QUAL ＜30.0 || MQ ＜20.0 || DP ＜7.

Annotation of genetic variants 

We annotated variants using diverse tools and databases. 
The region information of variants (such as coding or intron 
regions and splice sites) was annotated using SnpEff [20]. 
Further, we predicted the functional effects of variations on 
genes (such as silent, nonsense, or missense SNPs) using 
SnpEff  [20].  We  also  predicted  whether  an  amino  acid 
substitution significantly affects protein function (such as 
deleterious or tolerated SNPs) using SIFT [21]. In addition, 
we  checked  previously  known  SNPs  using  the  dbSNP 
database  [22].  We  also  checked  clinical  SNPs  using  the 
ClinVar database [23].

Analysis of depth of coverage in the diagnostic 
gene set

We  extracted  information  for  the  positions  of  the  175 
diagnostic genes from the hg19 reference genome, which 
was downloaded from the UCSC genome [24]. Based on 
this, we analyzed the depth of coverage and mapped mean 
depth  according  to  increasing  sequencing  depths  using 
Samtools "mpileup" with default parameters [17].

Count analysis of diverse variants

We calculated counts  of the number of  diverse clinical 
variants  including  nonsense,  missense,  and  deleterious 
SNPs in coding regions of the total genome and diagnostic 
genes using in-house scripts.

of variants for clinical use

hg19 reference genome, which was downloaded from the

discovery of clinically meaningful variants, we first sequenced

the  whole  blood  DNA  samples  from  ten  breast  cancer 
patients  using  the  Illumina  platform  GAII(x)  at  a  high 
sequencing depth of ∼200× (Fig. 1A). The platform covers 
95% of the human exonic regions (http://www.gemomics. 
agilent.com). We then extracted data at depths of 20× to 
200× by random selection and shuffling (Fig. 1B). Next, we 
performed  read  mapping,  local  realignment,  duplicate 
marking, and base quality recalibration for each sample (Fig. 
1C). Diverse variations such as SNPs, and insertions and 
deletions (indels) were called by using the GATK [16]. We 
also called function-related variations after the annotation of 
functional  and  regional  information  using  various  open 
databases and tools (Methods). Finally, we analyzed counts, 
positions,  reading  depths,  and  genomic  coverage  of  the 
identified variations as a function of the sequencing depth 
using total or diagnostic gene sets (Fig. 1D).

We  first  checked  the  numbers  of  called  SNPs  in  pro-
tein-coding (denoted as "coding SNPs") and total genomic 
regions (denoted as "total SNPs") of the platform in order to 
assess the effect of sequencing depth on the discovery of 
SNPs (Fig. 2A). As expected, the numbers of the identified 

total SNPs increased at higher average sequencing depths. 
For example, the median number of total SNPs for the ten 
samples gradually increased from 33,765 at 20× to 114,707 
at 200× (an increase of 80,942 for the total SNPs). However, 
the median number of SNPs in the coding regions increased 
more rapidly in the first half (an increase of 59,073 from 20× 
to 120×), and reached a plateau at an average sequencing 
depth of around 120×. The increase in the number of coding 
SNPs was significantly smaller after that (an increase of 827 
from 120× to 200×). This also means that the number of 
non-coding  SNPs  detected,  both  intronic  and  intergenic, 
increased rapidly after a depth of 120× was achieved. This 
phenomenon  was  more  or  less  consistent  across  the 
sequencing data, from the first sample to the last. This trend 
was also preserved in the indel variants (Supplementary Fig. 
1). Further, the number of indels in the total region of the 
platform (denoted as "total indels") increased steadily, but 
the increasing ratio of indels in the coding regions ("coding 
indels") leveled off after a depth of 120× was achieved.

After  functional  annotation  using  the  SnpEff  database 
[20], we analyzed the numbers of functional SNPs (nonsense,

missense, and silent) while increasing the sequencing depth. 
The results indicate that the median number of missense 
SNPs detected in the ten samples increased from 6,015 to 
9,731 (Fig. 2B). However, the rate of increase was sharp in 
the first half, slowing significantly after 120×. We observed 
a similar trend for the nonsense SNPs as well. In addition, 
this  phenomenon  was  also  observed  for  the  deleterious 
SNPs using the SIFT [21] (Fig. 2C). In summary, the number 
of  deleterious  SNPs  detected,  such  as  missense  and 
nonsense, increased with the sequencing depth, but the ratio 
of this increase reduced significantly after 120×.

Mutations  in  splice  sites  are  associated  with  many 
diseases [25-27]. Therefore, we next analyzed the number of 
SNPs detected near splice sites with respect to the sequence 
depth (Fig. 3). We found that the number of called SNPs 
increased with increasing depth. However, many of the SNPs 
were detected in intronic regions around the splice sites, 
about twice the number of those detected in exonic regions, 
when  increasing  the  sequencing  depth.  The  number  of 

detected SNPs, though, was lowest at the splice sites. This 
might  imply  that  the  sequences  of  the  exonic  regions 
surrounding the splice sites are well conserved than those of 
the  intronic  regions.  However,  researchers  who  wish  to 
detect  susceptible  SNPs  in  splice  sites  might  have  to 
sequence at depths of more than 120×. Similarly, all the 
variations reported in the dbSNP database were also more 
common  in  the  intronic,  rather  than  the  exonic  regions 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). 

To summarize, the number of deleterious SNPs and indels 
detected in the coding regions (which are widely used in 
clinical  diagnostics)  was  only  weakly  increased  a  depths 
more  than  120×.  In  other  words,  a  sequencing  depth  of 
120× can be considered reasonable when using the exome 
capture  sequencing  technique  to 
identify  significant 
variations in diagnostic studies.

Exome sequencing depth for diagnostic genes

Next, we analyzed the genomic coverage and mean depths

for  175  diagnostic  genes  (Supplementary  Table  1)  with 
respect to the diverse depths used. These genes have been 
widely  used  for  diagnostic,  prognostic,  and  therapeutic 
purposes at the Seoul National University Hospital in Korea. 
Specifically,  these  diagnostic  genes  are  a  subset  of  genes 
from  the  exome  dataset.  The  percentage  of  mapped 
sequences in the coding regions of the 175 genes was almost 
constant for each depth in the individual samples, although 
there  were  slight  variations  across  the  samples  (Supple-
mentary Table 2). We further observed that the distributions 
of the average mapped depths between all human genes in 
the  platform  and  the  diagnostic  genes  were  similar 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, with increasing depths, 
as  expected,  the  median  average  mean  depth  of  the  ten 
samples increased almost constantly from a depth of 13.3× 
to 125.1× (on average, an increase of 12.4× per depth) (bar 
charts in Fig. 4). In contrast, the coverage curves for the 
coding regions of the diagnostic genes followed logarithmic 
trends, regardless of the thresholds of the minimum read 

depths (line charts in Fig. 4). For example, based on the 
regions  with  more  than  1×  mapped  depth,  the  coverage 
increased  from  99.3%  to  99.7%  (0.4%  increase)  at  120× 
depth  compared  to  that  at  20×.  However,  the  coverage 
increased by only 0.1% at a depth of 80× (totally, 200×). 
Similarly, at 25× minimum mapped depth, over 77.9% of the 
genomic  regions  were  covered  when  120×  was  used. 
Moreover, a 64.6% increase in coverage was observed in the 
first half (from 13.3% at 20× to 77.9% at 120×), whereas a 
7.6%  increase  was  observed  in  the  latter  (from  77.9%  at 
120× to 85.5% to at 200×). It is known that a 25× mapping 
depth  is  the  minimum  for  detecting  heterozygous  alleles 
[28,  29].  In  other  words,  the  genomic  coverage  of  the 
diagnostic genes was not increased significantly after 120×.
We next checked the number and positions of SNPs that 
have been detected in the early onset breast cancer 2 gene 
(BRCA2), one of the major risk factors in the development of 
this cancer [30, 31]. The results indicate that the read depths 
of  SNPs  in  BRCA2  increased  with  increasing  sequencing

depths  (Fig.  5A).  However,  most  of  the  SNPs  had  been 
identified by the time 120× depth was reached, and no more 
were identified after 140× depth was used (Fig. 5B). Only 
mapped  read  depths  increased  with  increasing  sequence 
depths. Similar phenomena were also observed in the early 
onset breast cancer 1 gene (BRCA1) (Supplementary Fig. 4), 
another major risk factor in this cancer type [32]. 

Further,  we  validated  our  depth  recommendation  for 
diagnostic variant detection using exome sequencing. To this 
end,  we  analyzed  the  numbers  of  non-synonymous  (NS) 
SNPs, splice site acceptor or donor site (SS), and coding indel 
(I)  variants  in  the  diagnostic  genes  as  a  function  of  the 
diverse  depths  used  (Fig.  6).  The  numbers  of  NS/SS/I 
variants of all human genes in the platform increased with 
increasing  sequencing  depths  (Fig.  6A).  However,  the 

numbers of NS variants in the diagnostic genes converged 
sooner; there was least increase in the NS variants after 60× 
was used (Fig. 6B). We analyzed the numbers of NS variants 
using the variations in the ClinVar database [23], which is 
well  known  for  clinical  variants.  Although  there  was  an 
increase in the numbers of NS clinical variants, the rate of 
increase was quite low after 120× was used (Fig. 6C). We 
also checked the variations related to breast cancer using 
only the clinical variants in the ClinVar database (Fig. 6D). 
The results indicate that all variations associated with breast 
cancer  were  detected  at  140×  depth,  regardless  of  the 
sample.  In  summary,  with  exome  capture  sequencing 
technique,  the  most  significant  clinical  variations  can  be 
detected at an average depth of 120×.

Finally,  we  measured  the  discovery  rates  of  variants  at

(Fig. 7). The results show that more than 90% variations 
were validated when 120×. Hence, we conclude that, using 
the exome capture sequencing technique, the most reliable 

variants are detected at an average depth of 120×.

In  this  study,  we  determined  the  effects  of  exome 
sequencing  depth  on  the  discovery  of  function-related 
diverse  variants  of  human  genes  and  diagnostic  genes,

especially for clinical use. For this purpose, we investigated 
the  exome  deep-sequencing  data  for  whole  blood  DNA 
samples obtained from ten breast cancer patients using an 
Illumina platform GAII(x) as a function of sequencing depth. 
The number of genomic variants identified using exome 
sequencing reached a plateau at an average sequencing depth 
of  ∼120×,  and  this  depth  allowed  detection  of  most 
variations  in  the  human  genes.  The  results  were  also 
consistent with a diagnostic gene set and were similar across 
samples. Considering the diverse costs and time related to 
generation,  processing,  and  maintenance  of  sequencing 
data, this suggests that a feasible depth for clinically relevant 
exome  sequencing  is  about  120×.  These  findings  can  be 
used to address important questions on the adequate depth 
for exome sequencing techniques for clinical use.
