Human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  infection  is  the  leading  cause  of  cancer  mortality  among  women  worldwide.  The  life- 
threatening infection caused by HPV demands the need for designing anticancerous drugs. In the recent years, different 
compounds from natural origins, such as carrageenan, curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, indole-3-carbinol, jaceosidin, and 
withaferin, have been used as a hopeful source of anticancer therapy. These compounds have been shown to suppress HPV 
infection  by  different  researchers.  In  the  present  study,  we  explored  these  natural  inhibitors  against  E6  oncoprotein  of 
high-risk HPV-16, which is known to inactivate the p53 tumor suppressor protein. A robust homology model of HPV-16 E6 
was built to anticipate the interaction mechanism of E6 oncoprotein with natural inhibitory molecules using a structure- 
based drug designing approach. Docking analysis showed the interaction of these natural compounds with the p53-binding 

site of E6 protein residues 113－122 (CQKPLCPEEK) and helped the restoration of p53 functioning. Docking analysis, besides 

helping  in  silico  validation  of  natural  compounds,  also  helps  understand  molecular  mechanisms  of  protein-ligand 
interactions.

Introduction

Human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus from the papill-
omavirus family, accounts for 5.2% of all cancers worldwide 
and is also the causative agent of a subset of anogenital, head 
and neck cancers, and cervical cancer [1, 2]. Amongst these, 
cervical cancer contributes the most to cancer mortality in 
women worldwide, with an estimated 49,300 diagnoses and 
274,000 deaths annually [3]. Although there are more than 
200 types of HPV identified, the most commonly associated 
with  cervical  cancer  are  ‘high-risk’  HPV-16  and  HPV-18, 
responsible for about 62.6% and 15.7% of cervical cancers, 
respectively  [4].  Besides,  among  all  the  HPV-associated 
cancers, the proportion attributable to HPV types 16 and 18 
is 63－80% of penile cancers, 80－86% of vulva/vaginal can-
cers, 93% of anal cancers, and 89－95% of oropharyngeal 
cancers [5]. HPV-16 and HPV-18 remain the primary targets 

for anticancer drug development. 

The E6 and E7 onco-proteins have been shown to interact 
specifically with the p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pro-
teins, respectively [6]. Both pRb and p53 negatively regulate 
the cell cycle and also appear to inhibit G0－G1 and G1－S 
phase transitions. These interactions apparently play impor-
tant roles in the induction of cell immortality. The impor-
tance  of  p53-mediated  apoptosis  has  been  recognized  in 
terms  of  the  maintenance  of  homeostasis,  as  well  as  the 
prevention of neoplastic transformation. E6 forms a ternary 
complex  with  p53  and  E6AP  (E6  associated  protein), 
resulting in the degradation of p53 via the ubiquitination 
pathway [7]. 

HPV  has  been  known  as  a  causative  agent  for  cervical 
cancer for 3 decades, but effective treatment against HPV 
infection is still unavailable [8]. Natural products have been 
identified as promising sources of drugs for treatment and 
prevention of cancer in recent years [9].

Carrageenan  is  known  to  prevent  the  binding  of  HPV 
virions to cells. It can also block HPV infection through a 
second, post attachment heparan sulfate-independent effect 
[10].

Bava  et al. [11] demonstrated that curcumin sensitizes 
cervical cancer cells to the therapeutic effect of taxol, acting 
in the down-regulation of both nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) 
and the threonine/serine kinase AKT pathway. Curcumin is 
cytotoxic to cervical cancer cells in a concentration-depen-
dent  and  time-dependent  manner,  and  the  cytotoxicity  is 
higher  in  HPV-infected  cells.  The  authors  confirmed  the 
inhibitory action of curcumin on NF-κB activation, through 
the degradation of IκB, and on AP-1 binding, which results in 
the downregulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and in-
creased tumor cell apoptosis [11]. Moreover, it was shown 
that curcumin downregulates the expression of E6 and E7 
proteins of HPV-16, resulting in loss of the transforming 
phenotype and the cessation of cellular growth. Singh and 
Singh [12] explored other molecular mechanisms exerted by 
curcumin in cervical cancer cells, showing that it inhibits 
telomerase  activity,  the  RAS  and  ERK  signaling  pathway, 
cyclin D1, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase acti-
vity.

Withaferin A (WA) is the major active component of the 
Indian medicinal plant Withania somnifera, with antitumor, 
antiangiogenic, and radiosensitizing activity [13, 14]. An in 
vitro and in vivo study conducted by Munagala et al. [15] 
showed the inhibitory effect of WA against the proliferation 
of cervical cancer cells. WA was shown to downregulate the 
expression  of  HPV  E6  oncoprotein  and  restore  the  p53 
pathway, resulting in apoptosis of cervical cancer cells [15]. 
(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate  (EGCG),  the  most  abun-
dant  and  active  tea  catechin,  has  antiviral  and  antitumor 
properties. According to a clinical study, EGCG was effective 
in  patients  with  HPV-infected  cervical  lesions  when  deli-
vered  in  the  form  of  ointment  or  capsule  [16].  A  study 
conducted by Qiao et al. [17] showed the inhibition effect of 
EGCG on the growth of CaSki (HPV-16 positive) and HeLa 
(HPV-18 positive) cells in a time- and concentration-depen-
dent manner. Their results also observed that EGCG could 
inhibit the expression of HPV E6/E7. Lee et al. [18] isolated 
jaceosidin from the methanol (MeOH) extract of Artemisia 
argyi and reported its inhibitory effects on binding between 
oncoproteins and tumor suppressor p53. Indole-3-carbinol 
(I3C), found in cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower, 
broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts,was demonstrated to 
have anti-estrogenic activities in cervical cells [19].

The  purpose  of  this  in  silico  study  was  to  observe  the 
interaction between active compounds obtained from na-
tural products used for the treatment against HPV. In this 
study, a three-dimensional structure of E6 protein of HPV 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  2,  2014

type 16 was modeled using the Phyre 2 server, and structural 
refinement and energy minimization were performed by the 
YASARA Energy Minimization Server. In order to reveal the 
interaction between  E6 oncoprotein  with  natural ligands, 
docking analysis was performed using the AutoDock tool.

Methods
Hardware and software

The study was carried out on a Dell Workstation with a 
2.26  GHz  processor,  6  GB  RAM,  and  500  GB  hard  drive 
running in the Windows operating system. Bioinformatics 
software, such as AutoDock4.0 and online resources, were 
used in this study. 

E6 of HPV-16

E6 protein of HPV-16 was selected as the drug target. The 
HPV-16 E6 (GenBank ID: AAD33252.1) protein sequence 
was retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). 

Protein structure prediction and validation of drug 
target

For modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the E6 
protein, Phyre 2 server [20] was used. Structural refinement 
and energy minimization of the predicted model were carried 
out using the YASARA Energy Minimization Server [21]. 
The refined model reliability was assessed through Procheck 
[22], ProSA-web [23], ProQ [24], and Verify-3D [25]. The 
refined model was further verified by the ERRAT server [26].

Ligand preparation

Chemical structures of natural compounds (carrageenan, 
curcumin,  EGCG,  I3C,  jaceosidin,  WA),  along  with  CAS 
(Chemical Abstracts Service) registry numbers, reported in 
the literature were retrieved from the PubChem database 
(Fig. 1) [27].

Protein-ligand docking

Protein-ligand docking studies were performed using the 
AutoDock 4.2 program [28]. It is one of the most widely used 
methods for protein-ligand docking. All the pre-processing 
steps  for  ligand  and  protein  files  were  performed  using 
AutoDock Tools 1.5.4 (ADT), which has been released as an 
extension suite to the Python Molecular Viewer [28]. ADT 
was used to prepare the receptor molecule (HPV-16 E6) by 
adding all hydrogen atoms into carbon atoms of the receptor, 
and Kollman charges were also assigned. For docked ligands, 
non-polar  hydrogens  were  also  added.  Gasteiger  charges 
were assigned and torsions degrees of freedom were allo-
cated by ADT. 

The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was applied to

model  the  interaction  pattern  between  the  E6  oncogenic 
protein and selected inhibitors. The grid maps representing 
the receptor proteins in the docking process were calculated 
using AutoGrid (part of the AutoDock package). A grid of 50, 
50, and 50 points in the x, y, and z directions was centered on 
the p53-binding sites of E6 proteins. For all docking proce-
dures, 10 independent genetic algorithm runs with a popu-
lation size of 150 were considered for each molecule under 
study. A maximum number of 25 × 105 energy evaluations, 
27,000 maximum generations, a gene mutation rate of 0.02, 
and a crossover rate of 0.8 were used for the LGA. Autodock 
was run in order to prepare corresponding docking log file 
(DLG) files for further analysis.

Visualization

The visualization of structure files was done using the 
graphical interface of the ADT tool and the PyMol molecular 

graphics system (http://www.pymol.org).

Results and Discussion
Tertiary structure modeling and validation

E6 protein of HPV type 16 has 158 amino acids in its 
protein sequence. Since the three-dimensional structure of 
E6 was not available, its structure model was predicted using 
the Phyre 2 server by taking chain C of the crystal structure 
of full-length HPV oncoprotein e62 in complex with the lxxll 
peptide of ubiquitin ligase e6ap (PDB ID: 4GIZ) as a struc-
tural template. The query coverage of the target-template 
alignment was 90% with 96% identity. The predicted struc-
ture  was  then  subjected  to  the  Yet  Another  Scientific 
Artificial Reality Application (YASARA) Energy Minimiza-
tion Server for structural refinement. The total energy for the 
refined structure obtained from the YASARA Energy Mini-

whereas prior to energy minimization, it was 81,463,636,897 
kcal/mol (score, －4.21). 

The  stereochemistry  of  the  refined  model  (Procheck 
analysis)  (Fig.  2A)  revealed  that  99.2%  of  residues  were 
situated in the most favorable region and additional allowed 
regions, and 0.8% (Gln106) of residues were in the gene-
rously allowed region, whereas none of the residues fell in 
the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2B). 
ProSA-web evaluation revealed a compatible Z score (Fig. 
2C) value of －4.34, which is well within the range of native 
conformations of crystal structures [23]. The overall residue 
energies of the E6 3D model were largely negative except for 
one peak (Fig. 2D). The 3D model of HPV-16 E6 protein 
showed an LG score of 2.531 by Protein Quality Predictor 
(ProQ) tool, implying a high accuracy level of the predicted 
structure. A ProQ LG score >2.5 is necessary for suggesting 
that a model is of very good quality [24].

Similar assumptions were achieved using the ERRAT plot 

(Fig. 2E), where the overall quality factor was 91%. All of 
these outcomes recommended the reliability of the proposed 
model.

Docking analysis of HPV-16 E6 with natural ligands

As all natural ligands (inhibitors) were found to be docked 
in various conformations and with varying binding energies, 
the lowest energy conformation was selected. Upon docking, 
the high-ranked binding energies of modeled structures of 
E6 oncoprotein with natural ligands were obtained (Table 1). 
HPV  E6  degrades  the  p53  tumor  suppressor  protein.  To 
accomplish the process of degradation, E6 proteins bind and 
modify the target specificity of the ubiquitin ligase E6AP. 
Based on the resolved structure of HPV-16 E6 by Zanier et al. 
[29], Cherry et al. [30]  revealed in their docking analysis 
study that few flavonoid compounds bind in the hydrophobic 
pocket of the E6 and E6AP interface and mimic the leucines 
in the conserved α-helical motif of E6AP. Another study also 
showed that the biological activities of E6 are mediated by

the interaction of E6 with the LXXLL motif of E6AP [31]. In 
our study, the E6 protein of HPV-16 showed one LXXLL 
motif (103LCDLL107). Out of six natural compounds inclu-
ded in our study, three (carrageenan, EGCG, and I3C) were 
found to interact with the LXXLL motif of HPV-16 E6 by 
forming a hydrogen bond with Leu106. According to Crook 
et al. [32], the p53-binding site is around amino acid residues 
113－122 (CQKPLCPEEK) of HPV-16 E6 protein. The active 
site of the model was then analyzed based on the docking 
interaction of E6 with the p53-binding site with all 6 natural 
ligands.

Fig. 3 shows a docked pose of six ligand molecules with E6 
protein, which showed almost similar docking results. The 
detailed interactions are given in Table 1. Each ligand inte-
racts with the receptor at the p53-binding site. Among the 6 
different  ligands,  carrageenan  showed  the  lowest  binding 
energy (－13.95 kcal/mol) and inhibition constant (0.059 
μM) for the protein-ligand complex. Carrageenan was found 
to  interact  with  the  E6  residues  Ala53,  Phe54,  Leu106, 
Ile108, Leu117, and Lys122 by forming hydrogen bonds. As 
mentioned  in  the  introduction,  carrageenan  blocks  HPV 
infection [10]; from our docking study, it might be revealed 
that  the  block  of  HPV  infection  might  be  due  the  high 
binding affinity of carrageenan towards the p53-binding site 
of E6 protein.

WA showed the second lowest binding energy of －7.58 

kcal/mol  and  an  inhibition  constant  of  2.77  μM.  During 
docking with the receptor hydrogen bond, interactions were 
found with three residues (Ala53, Leu117, and Lys122) of 
E6.The other three compounds―EGCG, I3C and jaceosidin
―were also found to interact with E6 protein with binding 
energies  of  －4.13,  －4.06,  and  －4.01  kcal/mol,  respec-
tively.  Leu106,  Ile108,  and  Leu117  were  the  interacting 
residues of the receptor proteins with EGCG, whereas I3C 
interacted  with  Leu106,  Pro116,  and  Lys122;  Jaceosidin 
interacted with Phe54, Pro116, Leu117, and Lys122. 

Curcumin was found to interact with E6 protein with less 
affinity  (binding  energy  of  －3.09  kcal/mol).  All  natural 
ligands were reported to inhibit HPV infection; our docking 
study also revealed the in silico validation of the inhibition. 
HPV-16 is known for causing high-risk cervical cancer. All 
ligands were found to interact with E6 oncoprotein of HPV- 
16  with  significant  binding  energy  and  with  amino  acid 
residues  known  for  p53  binding.  This  interaction  might 
prevent E6 protein from interacting with host p53 protein, 
which may correlate with why these natural compounds are 
used to treat HPV infections.

Conclusion

Different natural products have been identified and used 
as promising drug sources against cancer caused by HPV.

are  proficient  invalidating those natural drugs through  in 
silico approaches. E6 proteins of high-risk HPV 16 inactivate 
p53 by inducing its degradation, a process that requires a 
ternary  complex  between  E6,  E6AP,  and  p53.  Low-risk 
HPVs, such as HPV-6 and HPV-11, do not have the ability to 
degrade p53. Thus, E6 of HPV-16 is of considerable interest 
for designing novel inhibitors to overcome the challenges of 
cervical  cancer.  A  high-quality  3D  model  of  E6  obtained 
through a computational approach and docking analysis em-
ploying AutoDock 4.2 in this study provided high-through-
put validation. This in silico approach may be of interest in 
designing new drugs from natural sources against cervical 
cancer.
