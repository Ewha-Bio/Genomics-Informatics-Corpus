Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite and a causative agent of toxoplasmosis in human. It causes 
encephalitis, uveitis, chorioretinitis, and congenital infection. T. gondii invades the host cell by forming a moving junction 
(MJ)  complex.  This  complex  formation  is  initiated  by  intermolecular  interactions  between  the  two  secretory  parasitic 
proteins—namely, apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and rhoptry neck protein 2 (RON2) and is critically essential for the 
host invasion process. By this study, we propose two potential leads, NSC95522 and NSC179676 that can efficiently target 
the AMA1 hydrophobic cleft, which is a hotspot for targeting MJ complex formation. The proposed leads are the result of an 
exhaustive conformational search-based virtual screen with multilevel precision scoring of the docking affinities. These two 
compounds surpassed all the precision levels of docking and also the stringent post docking and cumulative molecular 
dynamics  evaluations.  Moreover,  the  backbone  flexibility  of  hotspot  residues  in  the  hydrophobic  cleft,  which  has  been 
previously  reported  to  be  essential  for  accommodative  binding  of  RON2  to  AMA1,  was  also  highly  perturbed  by  these 
compounds. Furthermore, binding free energy calculations of these two compounds also revealed a significant affinity to 
AMA1. Machine learning approaches also predicted these two compounds to possess more relevant activities. Hence, these 
two  leads,  NSC95522  and  NSC179676,  may  prove  to  be  potential  inhibitors  targeting  AMA1-RON2  complex  formation 
towards combating toxoplasmosis.

Introduction

Toxoplasma gondii is an Apicomplexan intracellular parasite 
and is a causative agent of toxoplasmosis in human. It also 
plays a key role over a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes, 
like  encephalitis,  uveitis,  chorioretinitis,  and  congenital 
infections [1]. It infects the host by various modes, such as 
intake of undercooked meat containing T. gondii cysts, con-

sumption of contaminated water, and food defilement with 
feces from infected cats, and may also spread through blood 
transfusion [2, 3]. The sexual reproduction of T. gondii occurs 
in domestic cats, which are considered a definite host [4]. 
The asexual reproduction of this parasite occurs in inter-
mediate hosts—namely, humans, cattle, and birds [5]. The 
establishment  of  host-parasite  interactions  is  crucial  for 
parasite survival, as it depends on host nutritive resources. 
Apicomplexan  parasites  implement  a  unique  host  cell

invasion mechanism, wherein they anchor the host cell by 
forming  multimeric  protein  machinery,  called  a  moving 
junction  (MJ)  complex  [6].  This  complex  is  formed  by 
interprotein interactions established between two types of 
proteins-namely, rhoptry neck proteins 2/4/5/8 (RON 2, 4, 
5,  and  8)  proteins  secreted  by  rhoptry  organelle  of  the 
parasite  onto  the  host  membrane  and  apical  membrane 
antigen  1  (AMA1),  secreted  by  micronemes  [7-9].  The 
molecular association of RON2 and AMA1 is essential for 
initiating the host invasion process. 

AMA1 hydrophobic cleft

The hydrophobic cleft region of AMA1 is documented to 
play a predominant role in facilitating the binding of RON2 
to AMA1 and is also reinforced by recent crystallographic 
studies on AMA1-RON2 complex formation [10]. Moreover, 
this region is found to be highly conserved across the diverse 

family of AMA1 proteins and is surrounded by polymorphic 
flexible loops. These loops are speculated to preclude the 
host antibody response and has also been found to guard the 
conserved  sites  in  AMA1  [11].  The  hydrophobic  cleft  is 
found to span within domain I of AMA1 and forms a binding 
pocket that receives the critical loop region of RON2 due to 
its accommodative shape and charge complementarity. The 
hydrophobic  cleft  region  of  AMA1  includes  15  residues 
(Val142, Leu155, Ile161, Phe163, Ile171, Phe174, Leu179, 
Ile185, Phe197, Met203, Tyr230, Val231, Trp253, Trp353, 
and  Trp354)  [12].  Recent  studies  illustrate  that  RON2 
displaces a loop in domain II of AMA1, thereby exposing its 
binding surface, enabling the RON2 loop to penetrate deep 
into the hydrophobic groove of AMA1 and hence forming a 
stable complex during host invasion [13]. A recent study 
also showed that an oligopeptide binds across the full length 
of  the  AMA1  hydrophobic  cleft  to  prevent  AMA1-RON2

complex  formation  and  eventually  blocks  parasitic  host 
invasion  [14,  15].  Hence,  the  hydrophobic  cleft  and  its 
surrounding loops, which include the cysteine loop region 
and  coil  connector,  have  been  proposed  to  be  a  critical 
hotspot to block AMA1-RON2 complex formation. To date, 
there is a paucity of data on small molecules targeting these 
interactions.  Hence,  in  this  study,  the  coordinates  of  the 
crystal  structure  complex  depicting  these  interactions 
(Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID 2Y8T, AMA1 interacting with 
a surface-exposed region of RON2) [16] were subjected to 
an exhaustive, multilevel precision high-throughput virtual 
screen (HTVS) of ligands from the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) database with 250,000 compounds to identify leads 
that potentially disrupt these interactions. We also imple-
mented  molecular  dynamics  (MD)  simulation  analysis  to 
decipher the backbone rigidity changes of AMA1 hotspot 
residues, machine learning-based activity prediction, and bi-
nding free energy calculations for finalizing the potential lead 
compounds towards combating toxoplasmosis (Fig. 1) [17].

Methods
Protein preparation

As  an  initial  step,  the  crystal  coordinates  of  AMA1  in 
complex with a surface-exposed region of RON2 (PDB ID: 
2Y8T) was pre-processed using Protein Preparation Wizard 
of  the  Schrödinger  (New  York,  NY,  USA)  suite  towards 
optimizing the  stereochemistry by assigning proper  bond 
order,  removing  steric  clashes,  adding  hydrogen  atoms, 
fixing the disulfide bonds and missing residues and loops. 
Furthermore, optimization of the protein structure was also 
performed by adjusting the terminal chi rotation of aspa-
ragine, glutamine, and  histidine residues. Optimal proto-
nation  states  for  histidine  residues  were  also  assigned, 
followed by the removal of unwanted hetero groups. Finally, 
energy  minimization  was  performed  with  OPLS_2005 
(Schrödinger) to obtain the optimal geometry.

Receptor grid generation for exhaustive search

The receptor grid for docking was generated by assigning 
the entire hydrophobic cleft region of AMA1 to which the 
RON2 binds, thereby performing an exhaustive cavity search 
towards  achieving  an  optimal  ligand  binding  pose.  The 
residues spanning the RON2 binding cavity were noted from 
the Dimplot generated for the AMA1-RON2 complex [16]. 
The van der Waals radii for the receptor were assigned with 
a  scaling  factor  of  1.0  and  a  partial  cutoff  of  0.25.  The 
grid-assigned residues were Leu99, Val105, Leu109, Tyr110, 
Arg111, Val142, Phe143, Thr144, Glu145, Leu155, Asn162, 
Thr165, Gln169, Arg170, Ile171, Asn182, Asn184, Leu200, 
Thr201, Val202, Ala203, Met204, Tyr213, Tyr215, Tyr230, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  2,  2016

Ser232, Met233, Met236, Tyr241, Thr252, Trp253, Gln338, 
Phe339, and Gln361.

Ligand preparation

To  expedite  the  virtual  screening  of  ligands,  the  NCI 
ligand  datasets  (250,000  compounds)  were  screened  for 
drug-likeness  by  implementing  the  Lipinski  rule.  The 
filtered molecules were optimized by the LigPrep module 
(Schrödinger) by fixing the ring isomers, stereoisomers, and 
tautomeric forms. The reactive functional groups were also 
removed, and the resultants were scaled for van der Waals 
radii with a scaling factor of 0.80 and a partial charge cutoff 
of 0.15. Finally, the compounds passing all these filters were 
energy-minimized with OPLS_2005 as the force field.

Multilevel precision-based virtual screening 

The in silico virtual screening and docking of optimized 
NCI compounds against AMA1 were performed using the 
Glide  HTVS  option  of  the  Schrodinger  suite  2012  (Sch-
rödinger, LLC). As a first step, the entire RON2-interacting 
cavity  was  fixed  as  a  grid  box.  The van  der  Waals radius 
scaling  was  set  to  1.0  to  allow  free  scaling  to  soften  the 
non-polar regions of the receptor and the rest of the other 
atoms. Finally, the optimized small molecules were succe-
ssively docked to AMA1, ensuring flexible sampling with no 
more than 300 atoms and 50 rotatable bonds. A total of 10 
energetically favorable conformations were selected among 
the 1,000 generated poses per docking, and the best docked 
complexes were finalized, based on the Glide docking score. 
During  the  screening  process,  successive  elimination  of 
ligand  hits  was  performed  through  three  filtering  modes 
using the Schrödinger suite: 100% of HTVS hits were passed 
to standard precision (SP), and 80% of the best hits from SP 
were passed to extra precision (XP) mode. The top 10 hits in 
XP, based on Glide score, were shortlisted for further vali-
dation [18].

Prediction of Activity Spectra of Substances prediction

The  putative  activities  of  the  top  10  compounds  were 
predicted using Prediction of Activity Spectra of Substances 
(PASS). It implements a machine learning-based algorithm 
called biological activity spectrum (with 95% accuracy), and 
it  works  by  describing  the  intrinsic  properties  of  the 
compounds  and  by  comparing  the  structure  of  the  new 
compound  with  the  structure  of  well-known  biologically 
active  substances  to  check  whether  the  new  compound 
exhibits any of the specific functional effects [19]. Among 
the  10  shortlisted  compounds,  four  showed  significant 
activity relevant towards suppressing toxoplasmosis, along 
with  a  favorable  Glide  docking  score.  Hence,  these  four 
compounds were subjected to a rigorous validation process

of  calculating  Molecular  Mechanics  Generalized  Born 
Surface Area (MMGBSA) score and by performing an MD 
simulation.

MMGBSA scoring

MMGBSA scoring was performed for the top 4 complexes, 
so as to calculate and identify binding free energies in an 
explicit-solvent exposed state by implementing the Prime 
module of the Schrodinger suite. A more negative MMBGSA 
score indicates stronger binding [20].

MD simulation

MD simulation for both apo and the docked complexes 
was  performed  using  Desmond  3.6.  The  simulation  was 
initiated  using  the  OPLS_2005  [21]  force  field  with  the 
system solvated using the simple point charge water model. 
The system was neutralized by adding 4 Na＋ for apo and 6 
Na＋ counter ions for complexes at a concentration of 4.751 
mM.  Further,  this  system  was  energy-minimized  with 
OPLS_2005. The SHAKE algorithm was applied to restrain 
the geometry of water molecules and bond lengths and bond 
angles of heavy atoms [22]. Periodic boundary conditions 
were applied to stimulate a continuous system [23] and the 
particle mesh Ewald  method  for  long-range electrostatics 
[24].  Further,  the  system  was  equilibrated  with  NPT 
ensemble  by  setting  the  temperature  and  pressure 
parameters to 300 K and 1.0 bar, respectively. The Berendsen 
coupling  algorithm  was  chosen  for  temperature-pressure 
coupling [25]. Further, the equilibrated system, with a total of 

74,931 atoms, was exposed to a simulation period of 5,000 
ps with a time step of 2 fs, and trajectories were recorded 
after every 1.0 ps. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) 
was calculated for the backbone atoms and were graphically 
analyzed on a time point scale [26, 27]. Similarly, root mean 
square  fluctuation  (RMSF)  for  each  residue  was  also 
calculated to compare the major conformational changes in 
the residues between apo and holo forms [28]. The radius of 
gyration (Rg) was also calculated to infer the compactness of 
the  protein-ligand  complex  against  the  apo  form  [29]. 
Two-dimensional intermolecular interaction plots depicting 
the  complex  stability  throughout  the  MD  run  were  also 
generated to infer the stability of the protein-ligand complex 
formation.

Results and Discussion
Multilevel precision virtual screening and docking 
analysis

Three  different  stages  of  the  docking  and  scoring  pro-
cesses  were  used  for  this  study,  beginning  with  HTVS, 
followed by SP and final scoring with XP. AMA1 protein was 
sequentially docked with compounds from the NCI database 
using  Schrodinger  Glide.  Initially,  HTVS  was  performed, 
wherein 146,670 compounds were scored as hits, based on 
Glide score. Subsequently, these compounds were passed to 
SP mode, which yielded 1,466 compounds. Finally, within 
the SP resultant hits, 147 compounds were scored as po-
tential  hits  in  XP  mode.  Further,  these  compounds  were

ranked in accordance with the XP docking score, and the top 
10 ranking compounds proceeded to further analysis. These 
top  10  compounds  were  filtered  further,  based  on  Glide 
docking score, significant intermolecular interactions, and 
PASS prediction. Interestingly, all 10 of these compounds 
were found to occupy the hotspot region, which includes the 
hydrophobic cleft and cysteine loop region of AMA1, despite 
reference-guided docking procedures (Table 1).

Receptor-ligand interaction studies 

Scoring functions play a major role in the docking process 
for identifying plausible ligand binding poses and also for 
ranking the binding affinity. Among the top 10 compounds, 
NSC95522, NSC88253, NSC13604, and NSC179676 (Table 
1, Supplementary Fig. 1) were found to be highly significant 
in  collective  terms  of  XP  Glide  score,  PASS  prediction, 
formation of intermolecular H-bonds, and π-cation interac-
tions with the critical hydrophobic cleft residues, as well as 
in the cysteine loop region. NSC95522 showed a Glide score 
of −10.564 kcal/mol and formed π-cation interactions with 
Tyr110, Tyr213, and Tyr215, stabilized by 3 hydrogen bonds 
formed  with  Tyr230,  Ser232,  and  Tyr215  (Supplementary 
Fig. 1A). Tyr230 is a vital residue in the hydrophobic cleft, as 
it is the central tyrosine of the apical groove and is mandatory 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  2,  2016

for RON2 binding and also in the formation of a contiguous 
surface, which is critical for MJ assembly [30]. Ser232 is also 
documented  in  Plasmodium  falciparum  as  a  key  hotspot 
residue, as it occupies the hydrophobic cleft-spanning region 
[31]. Tyr213 and Tyr215 are also crucial, as these residues are 
key facilitators of conformational changes in AMA1 DII loop 
displacement  towards  exposing  a  clear  pocket  to  which 
Pro1309 of RON2 docks to the triad of tyrosine residues 
(Tyr110/142, Tyr213/234, and Tyr215/236) during AMA1- 
RON2 interactions [32]. PASS predicted this compound to 
be an ophthalmic drug and thus might also be found to be 
effective  in  treating  adverse  ocular-related  effects  due  to 
toxoplasmosis.
NSC88253 was bound to the hydrophobic cleft of AMA1 
with a XP Glide score of −10.392 kcal/mol, forming almost 
similar interactions to that of the AMA1-NSC95522 com-
plex with 3 hydrogen bonds: 2 with the backbone of Tyr230 
and Ser232 and 1 with the side chain of Tyr215. The π-cation 
interactions with Tyr110 and Tyr213 were also synonymo-
usly  stabilized  by  hydrogen  bonds  formed  by  residues 
Tyr230, Tyr215, and Ser232 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Tyr110 
is a coil connector and is documented to play an important 
role in the displacement of the DII loop of AMA1, which 
helps  in  the  binding  of  RON2  [32].  PASS  predicted  this

compound to be an ophthalmic drug with anticataract and 
corneal  wound  healing-stimulating  activities,  thus  sugge-
sting  it  to  be an efficient inhibitor targeting ocular  toxo-
plasmosis.
NSC13604 also showed interactions at the hydrophobic 
cleft of AMA1, with a XP Glide score of −10.016 kcal/mol. 
The  docked  complex  showed  2  hydrogen  bonds  with  the 
peptide backbone of Met204, which occupies the cysteine 
loop region. It also formed π-cation interactions with Tyr213 
and Tyr110, stabilized by the hydrogen bonds formed with 
Met204 (Supplementary Fig. 1D). Met204 is a key residue 
for  AMA1  targeting,  as  it  is  present  in  the  cysteine  loop 
region, which is also a critical substructure for AMA1-RON2 
complex formation. As per previous studies, disruption of 
the cysteine loop is found to exhibit inefficiency in domain-II 
loop displacement [17]. PASS predicted this compound to be 
antiprotozoal and may prove it to be efficient in targeting 
toxoplasmosis and also other apicomplexans. 
NSC179676 showed interactions with the hydrophobic 
cleft,  with  an  XP  score  of −9.893  kcal/mol.  It  formed  a 
single hydrogen bond with the backbone Ser232, which is a 

critical residue, as discussed earlier. It also formed π-cation 
interactions with Tyr213 and Tyr110 (Supplementary Fig. 
1I). PASS predicted this molecule to be antiprotozoal with 
corneal  wound  healing-stimulating  activities.  These  four 
compounds  exhibited  significant  features  in  terms  of  XP 
score,  key  molecular  interactions,  and  relevant  predicted 
activity  in  comparison  to  rest  of  the  compounds.  Hence, 
these  compounds  in  complex  with  AMA1  were  further 
validated for stability of complex formation by implementing 
MD simulation. 

MD simulation of apo and holo forms

MD trajectory analyses were performed for apo and also 
for the 4 shortlisted complexes. The backbone RMSD devia-
tion of the apo form of AMA1 was 1.6 Å, which has started 
to equilibrate and converge after 3,000 ps with a mean of 
1.432  Å  and  a  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  0.178  Å.  The 
receptor RMSD for all 4 holo forms showed convergence 
after the time frame ranging between ∼3,000 and 4,000 ps, 
with a maximum mean value of 1.65 Å and SD of 0.27 Å (Fig. 
2A). Hence, it does not mandate an extended production

NSC95522, NSC13604, and NSC179676 was less than 2.5 Å 
(acceptable range of 1–3 Å) [33], while NSC88253 showed 
3.6 Å of deviation, inferring complex instability (Fig. 2B󰠏F).
RMSF, Rg, and intermolecular bond stability as a 
measure of shortlisting potential leads targeting 
AMA1

The RMSF graph inferred NSC95522 and NSC179676 to 
exhibit the least fluctuation of ＜1 Å at the critical hotspot 
residues (Tyr230, Tyr213, Tyr15, and Tyr110) in comparison 
to the apo form, indicating a gain of backbone rigidity. As 
discussed earlier, flexibility of these residues is crucial for 
homing RON2. However, the other two compounds did not 
show this impact (Fig. 3A and 3B). Moreover, the Rg for both 
apo  and  all  4  holo  forms  was  found  to  be  within  an 
admissible deviation of ＜1 Å. NSC95522 and NSC179676 
showed the lowest Rg deviation of 0.44 Å and 0.53 Å, while 
the apo form showed 0.57 Å; thus, this reinforces that these 
two compounds confer backbone rigidity and compactness, 
which strongly preclude RON2 binding (Fig. 3C). Secondary 
structure element (SSE) perturbations were also analyzed in 
a similar way as discussed above. This inferred no major 
dynamism in the SSE during the entire production run; it

also corroborated with the fewest changes observed in the 
intra-molecular hydrogen bonds formed for the apo and all 
other  4  holo  forms  (Fig.  3D).  For  all  four  of  these 
compounds, the stability of protein-ligand contacts during 
the  production  run  was  analyzed  and  visualized  as  a  2D 
interaction  map  (Fig.  4A–D).  This  inferred  π-cation 
interactions  to  be  unanimously  stable  for  all  four 
compounds. Recent studies propose that ligands exhibiting 
π-cation interactions with Phe, Tyr, and Trp of the receptor 
highly influence the conformational stability of the proteins, 
as  they  are  strong  non-covalent  electrostatic  interactions 
[34, 35]. A holistic and stringent comparative analysis was 
performed over the 4 holo forms against the apo form, which 
strongly 
and 
AMA1-NSC179676  are  stable  complexes.  Moreover,  both 
these compounds exhibit prominent π-cation interactions 
with the proven hotspot residues Tyr213, Tyr230, Tyr110, 
and Tyr215 of AMA1 for ∼80% of the entire production run, 
implying  that  these  compounds  are  potential  blockers  of 
conformational  changes  of  AMA1,  which  facilitates  the 
binding  of  RON2  [35].  The  MMGBSA  scores  of  the 
AMA1-NSC95522 and AMA1-NSC179676 complexes were

formation [20].

In  conclusion,  NSC95522  and  NSC179676  shall  be 
considered  the  most  potential  leads,  with  both  showing 
significant binding free energies with strong intermolecular 
interactions to hydrophobic cleft residues. Moreover, these 
compounds were also found to limit the torsion angle of the 
AMA1 tilt of 90o, while the other two compounds showed a 
wide range of deviation (∼90o to 180o). Hence, all of these 
inferences  strongly  suggest  that  NSC95522  and  NSC-
179676,  with  antiprotozoal  and  ophthalmic  activity,  shall 
prove to be highly efficient leads for targeting AMA1-RON2 
interactions  (Fig.  4E),  thereby  combating  toxoplasmosis. 
However,  further  experimental  validation  is  required  to 
study the efficacy of these molecules.
