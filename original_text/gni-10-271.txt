Whereas a vast amount of new information on bioinformatics is made available to the public through patents, only a small 
set of patents are cited in academic papers. A detailed analysis of registered bioinformatics patents, using the existing patent 
search system, can provide valuable information links between science and technology. However, it is extremely difficult to 
select keywords to capture bioinformatics patents, reflecting the convergence of several underlying technologies. No single 
word or even several words are sufficient to identify such patents. The analysis of patent subclasses can provide valuable 
information. In this paper, I did a preliminary study of the current status of bioinformatics patents and their International 
Patent Classification (IPC) groups registered in the Korea Intellectual Property Rights Information Service (KIPRIS) database.

Keywords:  bioinformatics  patents  database,  International  Patent  Classification  (IPC),  Korea  Intellectual  Property  Rights 

Information Service (KIPRIS), US Patent Classification (USPC)

Introduction

There are many ways that research gaps between science 
and technology can be identified. Bibliographic citation of 
both academic literature and patent documents is one of the 
solutions.  Unfortunately,  patent  documents  are  consi-
derably less accessible [1], compared to academic papers. 
Whereas vast amount of new information is made available 
to the public through patents, only a small set of patents are 
cited in academic papers [2]. 

Thus, the essential problem arising from citing patents 
related to bioinformatics is to devise a classification metho-
dology  that  identifies  the  relevant  patent  and  only  those 
patents. The suitability of the methodology depends on the 
purpose of the analysis. However, no single methodology is 
ideal for identifying patents for a convergence technology, 
such as bioinformatics. By its nature, it is at the intersection 
of a number of patent classes. 

Accordingly, this paper tentatively employs several metho-
dologies simultaneously to analyze the current status of bio-
informatics and to find relevant subclasses, using the Korea 
Intellectual  Property  Rights  Information  Service  (KIPRIS, 
http://www.kipris.or.kr/) patent search system. Initially, a 
multiple-word search is undertaken of these patents’ titles 

and abstracts. The selected lists are then tabulated, based on 
International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses together 
with  some  known  bioinformatics  subclasses.  These  were 
then reviewed manually to establish a revised list of bio-
informatics patents. These steps have been repeated several 
times to establish the list of relevant IPC subclasses that 
appear most frequently in KIPRIS bioinformatics patents. 

Outline of Patent Search Methodologies

KIPRIS  is  an  internet-based  patent  document  search 
service that is available to the public free of charge. Korea 
Institute of Patent Information has been providing KIPRIS 
since 1996 on behalf of Korean Intellectual Property Office 
(KIPO). It covers publications of Korean Intellectual Pro-
perty  Rights  (IPR)  applications,  legal  status  information, 
and  trial  information.  Using  the  KIPRIS  system,  the 
following  simple  query  (documents,  containing  and  the 
keyword  DNA,  RNA,  and  protein,  and  containing  the 
keyword ‘algorithm, database, visualization’ in the abstract),
(DNA + RNA + protein + genome) * AB = [algorithm + 

database + visualization], 
would  retrieve  468  registered  patents  from  the  KIPRIS 
database, as in Fig. 1.

The number of patents can be further reduced by manual 
screening. Likewise, a common methodology is to undertake 
keyword searches of the patent title, abstract, or claim, as it 
is not practical to review the complete claims, specifications, 
and drawings of related patents.

However, this approach of a pure keyword search has the 
inherent problem of both including irrelevant patents along 
with  bioinformatics  patents  and  of  potentially  missing 
relevant bioinformatics patents. For example, the number of 
patent documents that have the keyword ‘bioinformatics’ in 
the  KIPRIS  database  is  446,  as  of  November  18,  2012. 
However, the majority of them can not be classified as bio-
informatics patents. On the other hand, there is no warranty 
that actual bioinformatics patents would at least have the 
keyword ‘bioinformatics’ in their documents. Nonetheless, 
this  approach  illustrates  the  converging  nature  of  the 
technologies  comprising  bioinformatics  and  represents  a 
good starting point for examining the cross-classification of 

bioinformatics patents. 

An alternative approach to expand a patent search beyond 
pure keywords is to include classification information and to 
use a definition of bioinformatics patents based on several 
patent  subclasses  in  which  bioinformatics  patents  are 
expected to be clustered. A good starting point to choose 
relevant 
IPC  (http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/) 
bioinformatics  classes  would  be  to  reference  preselected 
bioinformatics classes. For example, the US Patent Classi-
fication (USPC) bioinformatics patent subclasses (382/125, 
702/19, 702/20, 702/21, 703/11, and 703/12) suggested in 
[3, 4] could be used, and they have been mapped into IPC 
groups G06K 9/00, G01N 33/48, G01N 33/50, G01N 31/00, 
and G06G 7/58, as in Table 1, by using the USPC-to-IPC 
reverse concordance system (http://www.uspto.gov/patents/ 
resources/classification/index.jsp). 

Then, queries using various keywords combined with the 
groups in Table 1 were initially performed, using the Patent

bioinformatics patents. These steps were repeated several 
times to extend the list of relevant IPC groups that appear 
most frequently in the KIPRIS database. The query terms can 
be  dependent  on  the  characteristics  of  the  intellectual 
property associated with patents, such as algorithms, data 
contents, network analysis, and user interfaces.

The most frequently occurring groups based on the query 
term containing the keyword 'bioinformatics' in addition to 
the  combination  of  biological  sequence  keywords  in  the 
abstract was C07K 14/47 (peptides having more than 20 
amino  acids  from  mammals),  followed  by  C07K  16/08, 
C12N 15/11, C12N 15/31, C12Q 1/68, C12N 15/10, G01N 
33/68, G06F 17/30, and G06F 19/00. The most frequently 
occurring groups containing informatics keywords such as 
visualization,  algorithm,  software,  and  database,  together 
with some biological sequences was C12N 15/00 (mutation 
or  genetic  engineering;  DNA  or  RNA  concerning  genetic 
engineering), followed by C12N 15/63, C12Q 1/68, G01N 
33/68, G06F 17/30, and G06F 19/00. The most frequently 
occurring groups related to database contents or networks 
was G06F 17/30 (digital computing or data processing equi-
pment or methods, specially adapted for specific functions; 
information retrieval, database structures therefor). 

Combining the results of various queries, I finally selected 
213  patents  that  are  most  related  to  bioinformatics.  The 
main  groups  with  the  highest  frequency  were  C12Q  001 
(measuring  or  testing  processes  involving  enzymes  or 
micro-organisms) and G06F 017 (digital computing or data 
processing  equipment  or  methods,  specially  adapted  for 
specific functions), followed by G01N 033, C12N 015, C07K 
014, G06F 019, G06Q 050, H04L 012, G06F 015, and G10L 
015. Fig. 3 shows the yearly distribution of these groups.

Conclusion 

By identifying the relevant subclasses of bioinformatics 
patents, the research gaps between science and technology 
can be identified. In this paper, I did a preliminary study of 
the current status of bioinformatics patents registered in the 
KIPRIS  database. I  identified some  of  the  subclasses  and 
groups  related  to  bioinformatics  patents,  but  the  work 
presented  here  should  be  regarded  as  preliminary,  and  a 
more  detailed  analysis  using  text-mining  techniques  will 
follow in the near future.
