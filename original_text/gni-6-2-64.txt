Abstract

The  Korean  Rice  Ds-tagging  lines  Database  (KRDD)  is 
designed  to  provide  information  about  Ac/Ds  insertion 
lines  and  activation  tagging  lines  using  japonica  rice. 
This  database  has  provided  information  on  18,158  Ds 
lines,  which  includes  the  ID,  description,  photo  image, 
sequence  information,  and  gene  characteristics.  The 
KRDD  is  visualized  using  a  web-based  graphical  view, 
and  anonymous  users  can  query  and  browse  the  data 
using  the  search  function.  It  has  four  major  menus  of 
web  pages:  (i)  a  Blast  Search  menu  of  a  mutant  line; 
Blast  from  rice  Ds-tagging  mutant  lines;  (ii)  a  primer  de-
sign  tool  to  identify  genotypes  of  Ds  insertion  lines;  (iii) 
a  Phenotype  menu  for  Ds  lines,  searching  by  identi-
fication  name  and  phenotype  characteristics;  and  (iv)  a 
Management  menu  for  Ds  lines. 

Availability: The  KRDD  can  be  accessed  at  the  web  site 
of  the  National  Institute  of  Agricultural  Biotechnology 
(http://www.  niab.go.kr/RDS/) 

Keywords: Ac/Ds  database,  Ds  phenotype,  Ds-tagging

Introduction

Rice  is  one  of  the  most  important  cereal  crops  in  Korea. 
It  has  become  a  model  for  monocot  plants  because  of 
its  small  genome  size  (around  430  Mbp),  ease  of  trans-
formation,  availability  of  genetic  information,  and  eco-
nomic  importance  (Goff et al.,  2002;  Keller et al.,  2000, 
Sasaki  et al.,  2005).  In  rice,  insertion  of  mutant  genes 
has  been  a  powerful  strategy  for  assessing  gene  func-

tion.  The  large-scale  application  of  databases  in  T-DNA 
insertion  sites  requires  considerable  effort  (Parinov et al., 
2000).  But  this  database  can  easily  be  shared  with  the 
distribution  of  mutant  materials  and  analysis  of  end  se-
quence  databases  for  T-DNA  tagging  lines  in  rice  (An et 
al.,  2003). 
    The  Activator/Dissociation  (Ac/Ds)  line  has  a  variation 
in  the  transposition  frequency  and  distribution  pattern. 
The  Ac  element  was  shown  to  transpose  at  high  so-
matic  and  transposition  behaviors  of  an  Ac/Ds  system  in 
rice  (Enoki et al.,  1999;  Greco et al.,  2003).  The  flanking 
sequence-tag  database  showed  generation  of  an  activa-
tion-tagging  line  in  japonica  rice  (Jeong et al.,  2006).  In 
this  study,  we  obtained  data  on  the  characteristic  in-
formation  of  the  Ac/Ds  family  by  analyzing  insertion  and 
activation  tagging  lines  using  japonica  rice  (Oryza sativa 
L. Dongjin).  (Kim  et al.,  2004;  Park  et al.,  2007).

The  KRDD  is  designed  to  provide  information  about  the 
Ac/Ds  insertion  line  and  activation  tagging  lines  using 
japonica  rice.  This  database  has  provided  information 
on  18,158  Ds  lines,  including  the  ID,  description,  photo 
image,  sequence  information,  and  gene  characteristics. 
Cross-links  to  other  databases  are  also  introduced  to 
facilitate  the  access  to  individual  clone  information.  The 
use  of 
for  non-commercial 
purposes.  The  KRDD  is  visualized  using  a  web-based 
graphical  view,  and  anonymous  users  can  query  and 
browse  the  data  using  the  search  function. 
    The  KRDD  homepage  is  shown  in  Fig.  1,  and  the 
stored  data  are  visualized  using  a  web-based  graphical 
view.  It  has  four  major  menus  of  web  pages:  (i)  a  Blast 
Search  of  a  mutant  line;  Blast  from  rice  Ds-tagging  mu-
tant  lines;  (ii)  a  primer  design  tool  to  identify  genotypes 
of  Ds  insertion  lines;  (iii)  a  Phenotype  menu  for  Ds  lines, 
searching  by  gene  name  and  phenotype  characteristics 
among  specific  Ds  lines;  and  (iv)  a  Management  menu 
for  Ds  lines. 
    The  Blast  Search  is  searchable  by  selecting  specific 
databases,  consisting  of  DS  Sequence,  Indica  Core, 
Japonica  Core,  Indica  EST,  Japonica  EST,  Indica  Geno-
me,  Japonica  Genome,  Indica  GSS,  and  Japonica  GSS 
in  Oryza  sativa.  The  KRDD  uses  several  reference  data-
bases  to  facilitate  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  ge-
nome  sequence.  These  include  the  Entrez  nucleotide 
database  of  the  National  Center  for  Biotechnology

    The  Phenotype  View  can  be  searched  using  Ds  se-
quence  information  that  includes  chromosome  location 
(cM)  in  relation  to  anchored  genetic  markers.  To  in-
tegrate  genetic  maps  with  Ds  sequences,  we  searched 
bacterial  artificial  chromosome  (BAC)  and  P1-derived  ar-
tificial  chromosome  (PAC)  clones  for  each  chromosome 
that  contained  Ds-flanking  DNA.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  a 
phenotype  view  window  shows  that  all  analysis  results 
for  a  sequence  are  integrated  in  the  Ds-tagging  mutant 
line.  The  gene  characteristic  was  designed  based  on  the 
concept  of  the  Primer  design  tool  throughout  the  TIGR 
annotation  database.  The  DS  position  of  chromosome 
was  calculated  by  the  Primer  design  tool  program.

several  programs  for  search  and  analysis  of  Ds  line 
structures  (Fig.  3).  The  physical  schema  of  the  database 
is  shown  schematically  in  Fig.  4.  It  is  designed  specifi-
cally  to  provide  an  efficient  system  and  a  compre-
hensive  database  for  Ds  lines.  It  is  a  very  simple  model, 
based  on  only  two  core  types  of  objects. 
    The  interface  is  prepared  to  submit  and  analyze  each 
sequence.  To  prevent  disclosure,  a  user  needs  to  regis-
ter  and  enter  a  password,  which  serves  as  security 
control.  The  improvement  of  data  quality  can  be  made 
in  the  'Verification'  section  of  the  database  manager, 
which  allows  the  user  to  modify,  delete,  and  add 
information.  The  total  information  on  18,158  Ds  lines  is 
collected  by  the  system  and  then  is  made  available  to 
the  public  via  the  Internet.  The  KRDD  will  collect  addi-
tional  information  and  develop  a  useful  tool  for  Ac/Ds 
line  information.
