High-Dimensional Genomic Data

In genetic association studies with high-dimensional genomic data, multiple group testing procedures are often required in 
order to identify disease/trait-related genes or genetic regions, where multiple genetic sites or variants are located within the 
same gene or genetic region. However, statistical testing procedures based on an individual test suffer from multiple testing 
issues such as the control of family-wise error rate and dependent tests. Moreover, detecting only a few of genes associated 
with a phenotype outcome among tens of thousands of genes is of main interest in genetic association studies. In this reason 
regularization procedures, where a phenotype outcome regresses on all genomic markers and then regression coefficients 
are  estimated  based  on  a  penalized  likelihood,  have  been  considered  as  a  good  alternative  approach  to  analysis  of 
high-dimensional genomic data. But, selection performance of regularization procedures has been rarely compared with 
that of statistical group testing procedures. In this article, we performed extensive simulation studies where commonly used 
group testing procedures such as principal component analysis, Hotelling’s T2 test, and permutation test are compared with 
group lasso (least absolute selection and shrinkage operator) in terms of true positive selection. Also, we applied all methods 
considered in simulation studies to identify genes associated with ovarian cancer from over 20,000 genetic sites generated 
from Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27K Beadchip. We found a big discrepancy of selected genes between multiple 
group testing procedures and group lasso.

Introduction

In human genetic association studies with high-dimen-
sional genomic data, a multiple group testing procedure is 
often required to identify genes or genetic regions that are 
associated with a disease or a trait since a gene or a genetic 
region usually contains multiple genetic sites or variants. For 
instance, single nucleotide polymorphism data, DNA me-
thylation  data  and  sequencing  data  consist  of  tens  of 
thousands of genes where each gene has multiple genetic 
sites. In order to identify genes or genetic regions associated 
with a phenotype outcome, we need to conduct an individual 
group  test for  each  gene.  However, an individual  test for 
high-dimensional genomic data suffers from multiple tes-
ting  issues  such  as  the  control  of  family-wise  error  rate 
(FWER)  or  dependent  tests.  In  this  reason,  Bonferroni 
adjustment or false discovery rate (FDR) control methods 

[1-3] should be performed after computing the p-value of a 
multiple group test for individual genes or genetic regions. 
Alternatively, regularization procedures using a penalized 
likelihood can be applied for analysis of high-dimensional 
genomic data. Basically, regularization procedures perform 
variable selection based on a parametric regression with a 
penalty function, where a phenotype outcome regresses on 
all  of  genetic  sites.  As  a  tuning  parameter  for  sparsity  is 
decreasing, the most outcome-related genetic sites can be 
sequentially  selected.  One  of  the  most  popular  regulari-
zation  procedures  for  high-dimensional  genomic  data  is 
lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) [4-6]. 
For group selection such as a gene or a genetic region, group 
lasso can be applied to high-dimensional genomic data that 
has a group or a cluster structure [7, 8]. Since regularization 
procedures do not test but select a gene or a genetic region 
associated with a phenotype outcome, the control of FWER 
or FDR is not required. However, the selection of the optimal

tuning parameter is crucial to determine the number of the 
outcome-related genes or genetic regions. 

The main goal of both the individual group test and the 
group selection procedure is to identify disease/trait-related 
genes  or  genetic  regions  in  analysis  of  high-dimensional 
genomic  data.  Although  these  two  different  statistical 
methods  have  the  same  goal,  there  have  been  rarely 
statistical literatures which compare either test performance 
or selection performance of two statistical methods since 
hypothesis  testing  and  variable  selection  have  been 
considered as completely different approaches in statistics. 
In  genetic  association  studies,  however,  the  testing  pro-
cedure  essentially determines  whether  each  gene  or each 
genetic region is significantly associated with a phenotype 
outcome or not, while variable selection makes a conclusion 
which  genes  or  genetic  regions  are  associated  with  a 
phenotype outcome. Therefore, we can directly compare the 
true  positives  of  the  group  test  procedure  and  the  group 
selection procedure when they identify the same number of 
disease/trait-related genes or genetic regions. 

In this article, we conduct extensive simulation studies in 
order  to  compare  the  performance  of  both  group  testing 
procedures and group selection procedure in terms of true 
positives. That is, the total number of correctly identified 
genes or genetic regions is compared when the same number 
of  genes  or  genetic  regions  is  detected.  The  simulation 
studies  focus  on  a  case-control  association  study  with 
high-dimensional  genomic  data  which  has  a  group  or  a 
cluster structure. For group testing procedures, we consider 
commonly used three methods such as principal component 
analysis (PCA), Hotelling’s T2 test, and permutation test. 
For  group  selection  procedure,  we  employ  group  lasso. 
These  four  statistical  methods  are  also  applied  to  real 
high-dimensional  DNA  methylation  data  where  DNA 
methylation beta values of CpG sites from approximately 
12,000  genes  between  ovarian  cancer  cases  and  healthy 
controls  were  generated  from  Illumina  Infinium  Human-
Methylation27K  Beadchip  (Illumina  Inc.,  San  Diego,  CA, 
USA). 

Methods
Principal component analysis

PCA is one of the most common statistical approaches to 
data dimension reduction [9]. It basically transforms multiple 
variables to have orthogonality so the first principal com-
ponent can be expressed as a weighted linear combination of 
variables. The weights of the first component are computed 
such  that  the  component  can  account  for  the  greatest 
possible  variance  of  multiple  variables.  In  case-control 
association studies of genomic data with a group structure, 

we can apply PCA for each gene or genetic region, where data 
information of multiple genetic sites within the same gene or 
genetic region can be reduced to a single numerical vector 
corresponding  to  the  first  principal  component.  Then,  a 
phenotypic association of the principal component can be 
tested  based  on  the  independent  two  sample  T-test.  Sta-
tistical approaches based on PCA have been widely applied 
to analysis of high-dimensional genomic data [10-12]. 
Hotelling’s T2 test

Hotelling’s T2 test is one of the representative multivariate 
tests used when significant differences between the mean 
vectors of two multivariate data sets are tested. It is known 
as  a  powerful  multivariate  test  as  long  as  data  satisfies 
necessary  assumptions  such  as  random  samples,  multi-
variate  normality  and  equivalent  variance  and  covariance 
matrices between two groups. In genetic association studies 
with microarray data, the Hotelling’s T2 test is often applied 
to  find  differentially  expressed  genes  [13,  14].  We  also 
applied the Hotelling’s T2 test for each gene or genetic region 
to test a significant difference between cases and controls. 
We employed an R package ‘Hotelling’ for simulation studies 
and real data analysis.

Permutation test

that ∑  

Permutation test is a nonparametric statistical test used 
when an underlying distribution of genetic data is not need 
to be assumed. If the derivation of a theoretical distribution 
of  a  test  statistic  is  challenging,  permutation  test  can  be 
employed  to  compute  an  empirical  p-value  of  the  test 
statistic. For genomic data with a group structure, we first 
compute an individual p-value of a phenotypic association 
test for each genetic site. We then combine K p-values such

genetic site, and K is the total number of genetic sites in the 
gene  or  genetic  region.  Next,  we  repeatedly  permute 
    for  each 
permutation set. After we obtain the empirical distribution 
  ,  we  can  easily  calculate  the  empirical 
p-value from the original case and control set. This permu-
tation based test for genomic data with a group structure has 
been demonstrated to be very efficient and powerful when 
we need to aggregate the information of multiple genetic 
sites [15].

Group lasso

Statistical association tests above should be conducted to 
each  gene  or  each  genetic  region  one  at  a  time,  so  the 
individual tests cannot consider genetic correlations among 
genes. But, genes linked with each other on genetic pathways 
or  genes  that  have  an  interaction  effects  on  a  phenotype

outcome can have a functional relationship with each other. 
Since their correlations could be important information for 
genetic  association  studies,  a  statistical  model  that  can 
includes all of genetic information is often preferred. Regu-
larization procedures can be conducted to entire genomes in 
a  regression  framework,  where  a  phenotype  outcome  is 
regressed on all of genetic data. The solution of regression 
coefficients  can  be  achieved,  constraining  the  parameter 
space  of  regression  coefficients.  This  constraint  actually 
enables to obtain the coefficient solution even if the number 
of genes is much greater than a sample size. Depending on 
the  parameter  space  constraint,  a  type  of  regularization 
procedure is determined. Group lasso regularizes regression 
coefficients such that the sum of L2 norm of the coefficients 
for each group is less than an arbitrary value [7]. The arbi-
trary value is corresponding to a tuning parameter value for 
sparsity.  For  a  fixed  tuning  parameter  λ,  the  estimated 
regression coefficients β=(β1,β2,…,βm)T of group lasso 
maximizes

where l(β) is a logistic likelihood, and mk is the total 
number of genetic sites of the k-th gene, i.e., βk=(βk1,
βk2,…,βkmk)T.  The  L2  norm  of  βk  is  defined  as

 .

In genomic data analysis with a group structure, group 
lasso sequentially selects the most outcome-related gene or 
genetic  region.  The  selection  results  rely  on  the  tuning 
parameter value λ since we have different coefficient esti-
mates  for  a  value  of  λ.  As  λ decreases,  the  number  of 
selected genes is gradually increased. In general, we select 
the k-th gene if the estimated regression coefficients βk are 
nonzero.  In  group  lasso,  the  estimated  regression  coeffi-
cients of all genetic sites belong to selected genes or genetic 
regions  are  nonzero  while  all  genetic  sites  of  unselected 
genes or genetic regions have the exactly zero regression 
coefficients.  Therefore,  group  selection  can  be  performed 
based on the solution of regression coefficients for a fixed 
value  of  λ.  Note  that  the  numerical  values  of  estimated 
coefficients βk are not of interest since group lasso performs 
selection but not prediction. That is, we see if βk = 0 or not.
In our simulation studies and real data analysis, we first 
started with a relatively large λ value which is large enough 
that the solution to all regression coefficients can be exactly 
zero. In this case, no genes are selected. We then gradually 
decreased the value of λ until a single gene has nonzero 
regression  coefficients  of  its  genetic  sites.  This  gene  is 
considered as the top rank gene. In the same way, we can find 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

the second ranked gene as λ continues to be decreasing. 
Eventually, we can obtain a list of top ranked genes. Since we 
compared a particular number of top selected genes with the 
same number of top significant genes computed by multiple 
testing procedures, we didn’t need to find the optimal λ 
value in the simulation studies and real data analysis. Group 
lasso has been widely applied for analysis of high-dimen-
sional genomic data [8, 16]. We used an R package ‘gglasso’ 
for simulation studies and real data analysis. 

Results
Simulation studies

In this simulation study, we compared true positive rates 
of  three  group  testing  procedures  and  one  selection 
procedure  such  as  PCA,  Hotelling’s  T2  test,  permutation 
test, and group lasso selection procedure when the same 
number of genes is identified by four statistical methods. We 
conducted two different simulation studies, where the first 
simulation assumed that all genes are independent with each 
other  and  the  second  simulation  assumed  that  genes  are 
correlated  with  each  other  according  to  a  given  network 
information. 

In the first simulation studies, we assumed that a single 
gene consists of 5 genetic sites. Numerical data of the five 
genetic sites within the same gene were generated from a 
multivariate normal distribution of N(μ,∑), where a mean 
vector μ has a different value between cases and controls if 
the gene is causal, but μ has the same value between cases 
and controls if the gene is noncausal. The covariance matrix 
∑ represents a correlation pattern of the five genetic sites 
within the same gene and we assumed an AR(1) correlation

5,000 genetic sites in the simulation data, where 100 cases 
and 100 controls were generated. Only 20 genes out of 1,000 
genes are assumed to be causal. Note that the simulated

Three group testing procedures were applied to individual 
genes and the p-values of testing the mean difference bet-
ween cases and controls were computed for 1,000 genes. The 
p-values of each testing procedure were then listed from the 
smallest to the largest. Finally, top 20, 30, and 40 genes were 
selected for each testing procedure based on the 20, 30, and 
40 smallest p-values, respectively. In contrast, group lasso 
procedure  sequentially  selects  the  most  outcome-related 
genes as a tuning parameter for sparsity is decreasing. Since 
we can easily control the tuning parameter value, we were 
able to select the top 20, 30, and 40 genes. True positives rate 
of the selected genes from the four statistical methods were

were summarized in Fig. 1. 

In Fig. 1, it appears that all of true positive rates are overall 
increased  as  the  mean  difference  is  increasing  and  the 
correlation  coefficient  is  decreasing.  In  high-dimensional 
data analysis, it is often observed that detection power is 
decreased due to highly correlated variables. We can see the 
similar  result  of  decreased  true  positive  rates  for  highly 
correlated genetic sites. When we compared four statistical 
methods, both PCA and permutation test seem to have the 
largest true positive rates in all simulation settings, while 
Hotelling’s T2 test show the lowest true positive rates in all 
settings. The true positive rates of group lasso procedure 
seem  to  be  higher  than  those  of  Hotelling’s  T2  test,  but 
slightly lower than those of both PCA and permutation test. 
Consequently, we can conclude that group lasso procedure 
shows  similar  selection  performance  as  the  group  hypo-
thesis testing procedures in the first simulation study. 

In the second simulation study, we generated 1,000 genes 
where each 100 genes are truly correlated with each other 
according to the simulated genetic network in Fig. 2. So, we 
have 10 network groups each of which consists of 100 genes. 
Similar  to  the  first  simulation  study,  genetic  data  was 
generated from N(μ,∑), where the covariance matrix ∑ is 
an inverse of a precision matrix Ω In a Gaussian graphical 
model [17], nonzero entries of the precision matrix corre-
spond  to  links  between  two  genes  of  a  network  graph.

That is, only 20 causal genes were assumed to have a mean

True  positive  rates  stand  for  the  proportion  of  correctly 
identified genes among the 20 causal genes. The simulation 
was repeated 100 times and averaged true positive rates of 
four  statistical  methods  over  100  simulation  replications

Therefore, we could obtain the precision matrix Ω according 
to the given network in Fig. 2 in the same way described [12, 
18].  Our  simulation  data  consists  of  100  cases  and  100 
controls over 1,000 genes, where only 45 genes within the 
same network have a different mean μ between cases and 
controls.  Let  us  denote  the  j-th  gene  by  χj.  Since  our 
simulation study should be conducted for genetic sites with 
a group structure, we additionally generated 10 genetic sites 
for each gene. If the first N genetic sites among 10 sites are 
causal and the other 10 - N genetic sites are noncasual, the N 
sites of the the j-th gene were generated such that χjk = χj

), k = 1, 2, ..., N and χjk = N(0,σ
+ N(0,σ
..., 10. Finally, we have a total of 10,000 genetic sites with 
200 samples. In the simulation, we discarded all simulated 
genes χj for j = 1, 2, ..., 1,000. Instead, we used only 10,000 
genetic sites where each 10 sites consist of one gene. In this 
simulation setting, 10 genetic sites within the same gene are 
not  only  correlated  with  each  other,  but  they  are  also 
correlated with the other 10 genetic sites within the different 
genes that are linked with each other according to the genetic 
network. 

We also applied four statistical methods used in the first 
simulation study. We fixed the number of causal genetic sites 
per gene as N = 2, 5, or 10. Since only 45 genes are causal, the 
number of causal sites is 90, 225, or 450 among 10,000 sites, 
respectively. The standard deviation  σ to control a noise

level was set to be 1.5, 2, or 2.5. Higher standard deviation is 
likely to produce stronger noises, so true positive rates are 
expected  to  be  decreased.  Simulation  was  repeated  100 
times and averaged true positive rates of top 10 genes to top 
100 genes selected by four methods are summarized in 
Fig. 3.

In Fig. 3, PCA overall shows the best selection perfor-
mance except when the noise level is either moderate or 
strong, and the number of causal genetic sites is small, i.e., 
N = 2 and σ= 2 or 2.5. As the number of causal sites in a 
gene is decreasing, the  true positive  rates of three group 
testing procedures seem to be decreasing together. However, 
we can see that the true positive rates of group lasso are 
almost the same regardless of the number of causal sites in 
a gene. As we mentioned earlier, group lasso enforces the 
regression coefficients of genetic sites in the selected genes 
to be nonzero even if only a few genetic sites are causal and 
majority is noncausal. In this reason, the selection perfor-
mance of group lasso does not affected by the number of 
causal and noncausal sites in the same gene. When all of 
genetic sites in the same gene are causal (N = 10), both PCA 
and permutation test overwhelm the other two methods. 
Since computation of the test statistics of two methods is 
based on individual genetic sites, they should be statistically 
powerful when all of sites in the same gene are causal. In the 
second simulation, the Hotelling’s T2 test shows the worst

selection of true positives in all simulation settings. This is 
due to relatively high correlation among genetic sites in the 
same genes. We have already seen that the true positive rates 
of  Hotelling’s  T2  test  were  drastically  decreased  as  the 
correlation was increasing in the first simulation study. 

Analysis of ovarian cancer DNA methylation data

Next, we applied four statistical methods to real ovarian 
cancer DNA methylation data. Ovarian cancer DNA meth-
ylation  data  generated  from  Illumina  Infinium  Human-
Methylation27K  Beadchip  has  been  already  applied  to 
identify CpG sites and genes associated with ovarian cancer 
from some different studies [19-21]. The methylation data 
set consists of 20,461 CpG sites from 12,770 genes with 152 
controls and 119 cases. Many genes have either one or two 
CpG sites and some genes have up to 9 CpG sites. Since our 
four statistical methods can be applied to genomic data with 
a  group  structure,  and  our  main  goal  of  this  study  is  to 
compare  group  testing  procedures  with  group  selection 
procedure, we excluded genes that have only one CpG site in 
the analysis. So, we ended up with 14,627 CpG sites from 
6,936 genes which have at least two CpG sites. 

In the exactly same way used in the simulation studies, we 
identified top 20 genes for each method. Table 1 shows the 
top  20  genes  and  their  p-values  computed  by  PCA  and 
Hotelling’s T2 test. Also, 20 selected genes by group lasso 
procedure are included in the table. For the permutation test, 
we permuted the data over 1,000,000 times, but we found 
–7. 
that the empirical p-values of 246 genes are still less than 10
Due to time limit, we cannot reduce down the number of 
genes in the top list of permutation test anymore. Therefore, 
we had to finalize with top 246 genes detected by permu-
tation test. For each statistical method, Fig. 4 summarizes 
the number of overlapped genes among top 20 genes by the 
other three methods. 

In Fig. 4, it appears that 15 genes in the top 20 list of PCA 
is also in the top 20 list of Hotelling’s T2 test, while only 2 
genes in the top 20 list of PCA is in the top 20 list of group 
lasso. Similarly, we can see that only 3 genes in the top 20 list 
of Hotelling’s T2 test is in the top 20 list of group lasso. Top 
246 genes detected by permutation test include all of the 20 
genes detected by both PCA and Hotelling’s T2 test, but only 
7 genes among the 246 genes are overlapped with top 20 
genes  selected  by  group  lasso.  This  result  indicates  that

genes selected by group lasso are quite different from genes 
detected by three group testing procedures. 

Next, we identified top 246 genes by each of four different 
statistical  methods  since  the  minimum  number  of  genes 
detected by permutation test is 246. Fig. 5 summarizes the 
number of overlapped genes among 246 genes by the other 
three methods. It seems that three group testing procedures 
of PCA, Hotelling’s T2 test and permutation test have from 
164 (66.67%) to 205 (83.73%) overlapped genes with each 
other. In contrast, group lasso selection procedure have only 
24  (9.76%)  to  31  (12.60%)  overlapped  genes  with  three 

group testing procedures. In this result, we can conclude that 
most of genes selected by group lasso are very different from 
genes  detected  by  multiple  group  testing  procedures  in 
high-dimensional DNA methlyation data analysis. 

In  the  first  simulation  study  three  group  testing  pro-
cedures  and  group  lasso  selection  procedure  show  very 
similar  selection  performance.  However,  selection  perfor-
mance of four methods was quite different from each other 
in the second simulation study. We demonstrated that true 
positive selection could vary on the number of causal sites 
and  the  noise  level.  In  analysis  of  ovarian  cancer  DNA

methylation data, we found that group lasso identified quite 
different  genes,  compared  with  three  group  testing  pro-
cedures.  In  general,  regularization  procedures  like  group 
lasso  are  known  as  a  good  alternative  method  to  testing 
procedures  when  we  identify  disease  or  trait  associated 
genes  with  high-dimensional  genomic  data,  where  the 
number  of  genes  far  exceeds  the  number  of  samples. 
However, our investigation found that many genes selected 
by group lasso are rarely overlapped with genes detected by 
three  group  testing  procedures,  which  detected  many 
overlapped genes. The similar situation was observed when 
the number of causal sites is small and the noise level is 
relatively large in our second simulation study. In that case, 
true positive rates of group lasso are much higher than those 
of  three  group  testing  procedures,  where  three  testing 
procedures shows the almost same selection performance. 
In real DNA methylation data multiple genes are usually 
highly correlated with each other. Moreover, the number of 
causal sites could be small and the noise level could be large. 
But, further biological investigation with genes selected by 
group  lasso  should  be  conducted  to  figure  out  the  main 
reason  of  this  big  discrepancy  between  group  lasso  and 
group tests in analysis of DNA methylation data. 

Discussion

In this article, we compared group testing procedures with 
group  lasso  selection  procedure  when  high-dimensional 
genomic data with a group structure are used for case-control 
genetic association studies. In statistics, hypothesis testing 
and  variable  selection  are  regarded  as  totally  different 
statistical methods since their objectives are different from 
each  other.  Therefore,  the  comparison  of  these  two  sta-
tistical approaches has not been studied much. However, in 
genetic association studies with high-dimensional genomic 
data, both testing and selection procedures have the same 
goal which is to identify genes of genetic regions that are 
associated with either a disease or a trait. Particularly, many 
types of high-dimensional genomic data consist of multiple 
groups  where  each  gene  or  each  genetic  region  contains 
some genetic sites or variants. So, our research focused on 
the comparison of group testing procedures and group lasso 
selection procedure. 

In simulation studies, we found that the selection per-
formance of group lasso and group testing procedures could 
be similar or very different from each other. It depends on 
data  structure  such  as  correlation  strength  and  patterns 
among genes, the number of causal sites in a gene and noise 
levels. In real data analysis, it was surprising that group lasso 
identified  many  different  genes  that  are  not  detected  by 
group  testing  procedures  in  ovarian  cancer  association 

studies of DNA methylation data. Although group lasso is 
known as one of the most commonly used selection methods 
in statistics when the number of variables is much greater 
than a sample size, it shows unexpected selection results in 
ovarian  cancer  data  analysis.  In  contrast,  multiple  group 
testing procedures including PCA, Hotelling’s T2 test and 
permutation  test  identified  almost  the  same  genes  asso-
ciated  with  ovarian  cancer.  Since  multiple  group  testing 
procedures are still the most popular method for medical 
doctors and geneticists to apply for high-dimensional geno-
mic data with a group structure, we might need to further 
investigate the validity of group lasso selection procedure in 
genetic association studies. In future study, our investigation 
will focus on finding additional reasons that we had many 
genes detected by group test procedures but missed by group 
lasso in ovarian cancer data.
