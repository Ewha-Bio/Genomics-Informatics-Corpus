Abstract
Serotonin  (5-HT),  the  endogenous  nonselective  5-HT 
receptor agonist, activates the inositol -1,4,5- triphosphate 
/ calcium (InsP3/Ca2+) signaling pathway and exerts both 
stimulatory and inhibitory actions on cAMP production and 
neuromodulin  secretion  in  rat  hypothalamic  neurons. 
Specific mRNA transcripts for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT4 
were  identified  in  rat  hypothalamic  neurons.  These 
experiments were supported by combined techniques such 
as  cAMP  and  a  Ca2+  assays  in  order  to  elucidate the 
associated receptors and signaling pathways.

The cAMP production and neuromodulin release were 
profoundly inhibited during the activation of the Gi-coupled 
5-HT1A receptor. Treatment with a selective agonist to 
activate the Gq-coupled 5-HT2C receptor stimulated InsP3 
production and caused Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic 
reticulum.  Selective  activation  of  the  Gs-coupled  5-HT4 
receptor also stimulated cAMP production, and caused an 
increase in neuromodulin secretion.

These findings demonstrate the ability of 5-HT receptor 
subtypes expressed in neurons to induce neuromodulin 
production. This leads to the activation of single or multiple 
G-proteins  which  regulate  the  InsP3/Ca2+/PLC-γ  and 
adenyl cyclase / cAMP signaling pathways. 

phosphorylation  of  neuromodulin.  This  decreases  its 
affinity for calmodulin, suggesting that neuromodulin may 
function  to  bind  and  concentrate  calmodulin  within 
neurons, releasing it locally in response to phosphorylation 
by PKC (Chapman et al, 1992). PKC is activated by the 
PLC-γ signaling pathway. PLC-γ binds phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), which anchors the enzyme to the 
plasma membrane and enhances its catalytic activity for 
cAMP  production.  The  calcium  buffering  capacity  of 
patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases has 
been reported to be diminished, probably due to either a 
deficit or deficiency in intracellular Ca2+binding structures 
such as the neuromodulin-calmodulin complex (Ibaretta et 
al, 1997).

The serotoninergic system is one of several neuronal 
inputs that innervate hypothalamic neurons (Almero et al, 
2000). In hypothalamic neuronal cells, it has been shown 
that serotonin receptors are involved with the secretion of 
neuromodulin.  The  expression  of  serotonin  receptors 
increases  intracellular  Ca2+levels  that  can  regulate 
neuromodulin secretion and calmodulin signaling in the 
presence of PKC (Lee et al, 2002; Kim et al, 2003).

In  this  study,  the  synaptic  relationship  between 
serotoninergic terminals and neuromodulin was investigated 
in rat hypothalamic neurons using RT-PCR and western 
blotting analysis. We traced the signaling pathway for the 
regulation of neuromodulin secretion by serotonin receptor 
subtypes (Chapman et al, 1985). These observations led 
to the idea that the networks linking the neurotransmitters 
and the secreted peptide hormones from the hypothalamic 
neuron cells regulate neuronal plasticity.

Introduction
Neuromodulin (known as P-57, GAP-43, and B-50) is a 
neural specific, membrane associated protein which has 
been implicated in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, and 
in synaptic plasticity (Casoli et al, 2001). Neuromodulin is a 
major presynaptic substrate for the protein kinase C (PKC)

Materials & Methods 
Materials 
5-hydroxytryptamine was purchased from Sigma Aldrich 
(ST  Louise,  MO).  Selective  serotonin  agonists,  HT1A 
(Ipsapirone), HT2C (MK 212) and HT4 (Cisapride) were 
purchased from Tocris Bioscience(Ellisville,MO).

Animal  preparation  and  primary  neuronal  cell 
culture
Male Wistar rats weighting 200 g (12 weeks-old) were 
housed in air-conditioned animal quarters, with lights on,

and given food and water ad libitum. The tail was grasped 
and cervical dislocation was performed to terminate the 
animals, followed by decapitation using a guillotine. The 
scalp was scraped the scalp from the mastoid area to 
expose the skull. The skull was incised along the external 
auditory meatus and the brain was removed. The borders 
of  the  excised  hypothalamus  were  delineated  by  the 
anterior margin of the optic chiasm, the posterior margin 
of the mammillary bodies, and laterally by the hypothalamic 
sulci. The separated hypothalamus were split into two 
pieces each and placed in ice cold HBSS with 0.002% 
deoxyribonuclease  and  chopped  using  2  blades.  The 
tissues  were  added  to  20  ml  HBSS  with  trypsin  (final 
concentration 0.01%) in a 37°C water bath for 15 minutes 
and shaken. This was followed by the addition10% FBS 
in NB media (1:1 vol / vol) and pipetting 10 times with a 
Pasteur pipette. Tissue was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 
for 5 minutes and the cells were resuspended in neurobasal 
media containing B27, penicillin / streptomycin, and 2mM 
Glutamine. Cells were plated in a 6 well plate pre-coated with 
poly-D-lysine,  at  a  density  of  1×106  cells  /  well.  The 
stabilized tissue was treated with neurobasal medium only 
and 25 µM of serotonin in neurobasal medium for 2 hours 
at 37°C with 5% CO2. The hydrophobic impurities were 
removed using an Oasis HLB cartridge and washing the 
tissue with 0.5% acetonitrile and 0.1% tetrafluoroacetic 
acid. The stabilized tissues were finally treated with 25 µM 
of the selective serotonin agonists, HT1, HT2 and HT4 
respectively for 2 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2.

LC-MS/MS and Database analysis 
The purified sample was dried in a speedvac for 2 hours 
and eluted in distilled water to 100 µl of total volume with 
a concentration of about 100 µg/ml of protein. The sample 
was stored at -200°C overnight and 90 µl of sample was 
analysed using chromatographic analysis. The chromato-
graphic analysis was performed on an AKTA FPLC system 
(Amersham Bioscience, UK) consisting of an isocratic 
pump, an auto-sampler with injector, columns, tubing and 
an ultraviolet detector controlled by Unicorn systems. The 
prepared 90 µl samples were injected onto a C-4 narrowa-
nalytical column and eluted with 0.1% acetonitrile and tet-
rafluoroacetic acid or distilled water at a flow rate of 1 
mL/min. The absorbance of the eluant at 215 nm was 
monitored. Finally, the column was washed out with 20% 
ethanol for 1 hour to remove the remnants.

Ten  micrograms  of  the  secretome  were  taken  and 
denaturated at 900°C for 20 minutes.addition, the samples 
were reduced by adding 10 mM of DTT, and incubated at 
560°C for 20minutes. The samples underwent alkylation for 
another 20 minutes in a dark room with the addition of 100 
mM of iodoacetamide. Finally, the samples were digested 

with 0.1 µg of trypsin overnight.

For these experiments, the mass spectrometer was 
connected on-line with an AKTA Basic liquid chromato-
graph (GE Healthcare, NJ) by using an RP-C18, 300 m ID 
5 cm column (Dionex, CA). Peptides were eluted from the 
column using a linear gradient of acetonitrile with 0.2% for-
mic acid from 5 to 60% for 50 min, at a flow rate of 3 L/min. 
To acquire the LC-MS/MS spectra the first quadrupole was 
used to select the precursor ion within a window of 4 Th. 
A pressure of ~3×10-2Pa of collision gas (argon) was used 
in the hexapole collision cell to yield the fragment ions. The 
doubly- and triply- charged precursor ions to be fragmented 
were  selected  automatically  once  their  intensity  rose 
above a defined threshold (8 conts s-1). The instrument re-
verted to MS mode once the total ion count decreased be-
low 2 count sec-1 or when the MS/MS mode had been main-
tained for 4 sec. Data acquisition and processing were per-
formed using a MassLynx system (version 3.5) from Waters 
(MA). Protein identifications were based on manual inter-
pretation of the MS/MS spectra4). The program Selestact 
(CIGB, Havana, Cuba) coded in C for the console use was 
developed to scan the Swiss-Prot sequence database, and 
calculate the number of proteins present.

RT-PCR analysis of 5-HT receptor subtype
The total RNA was extracted from the selective serotonin 
agonist  treated  cells  using  RNA  RT-PCR  Kits  (Takara, 
Japan) The RNA was digested with DNAse in a low-salt buffer 
to remove any remaining DNA. Reverse transcription was 
performed using AVM reverse transcriptase XL (Takara, 
Japan). Briefly, 5 µg of total RNA was used as a template; 
the first strand of cDNA was made using 1 µl of dNTP mixture 
in a 10 µl reaction volume with 0.25 µl of RNAse inhibitor. Heat 
denaturation of reverse transcriptase was performed at 99°C 
for 5 minutes. Reverse transcription was performed at 420°C 
for 30 minutes. A 0.5 µl aliquot of cDNA was used as a 
template. The primers used were as follows:

5-HT1A receptor forward: CATTTCTTTTTCCCTCCCTTCC
reverse: CTCCCTTCCTTCCGTATTCCC
5-HT2C receptor forward: GGCATCCTTCCACTTCTGTAGTC
reverse: GGCATCCTTCCACTTCTGTAGTC
5-HT4 receptor forward: GAGTTCCAACGAGGGTTTCAG
reverse: AATGCGATGCGTAGAGGGG

The expected sizes of 5-HT1, 5-HT2C, 5-HT4 were 321, 
347 and 315 nucleotides, respectively. The PCR conditions 
were: denaturing at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 
cycles of denaturing at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 
60°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 60 seconds. 
The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 
2% agarose gels.

Western Blot
The secretomes containing an equal amount of protein were 
separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose 
membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Bioscience, Bucking- 
hamshire, England). The membrane was incubated with an 
antibody as specified, followed by a secondary antibody con-
jugated with horseradish peroxidase. Specific antigen- anti-
body  complexes  were  detected  by  enhanced  chem-
iluminescence (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL). 
GAP-43 (anti- neuromodulin) antibodies (Santa Cruz, USA) 
were used in this study. 

Determination of cAMP Level 
cAMP  was  assayed  using  the  cAMP  EIA  system 
(Amersham) according to the method specified by the 
manufacturer. To determine the total cAMP level, selective 
serotonin  agonist  treated  samples  were  heated  for  5 
minutes followed by centrifugation at 12000 g for 2 minutes 
at 4°C. The cAMP levels of supernatants were determined 
as the total cAMP levels which were expressed in fmol / 
OD  unit  (at  600  nm)  of  the  sample.  The  pellets  were 
suspended in 20 µl of H2O, and heated for 5 minutes at 
100°C. Samples were centrifuged at 12000 g for 2 minutes 
at 4°C, and supernatants were removed. The reaction was 
terminated using 60 µl of 80% ice cold ethanol and then 
centrifuged 12000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Thesupernatants 
were dried, and the pellets were suspended in 10 µl of H2O 
and used for the determination of intracellular cAMP levels. 
The intracellular concentration of cAMP was calculated on 
the assumption that an OD600 of 1.4 corresponds to 109 
cells / ml (Miller, 1972) and the volume of each cell is 
2×10-12ml (Joseph et al, 1982).

Ca2+ Assays
Receptor signaling activity was measured in intact cells 
using  a  fluorometric  plate-based  assay  for  detecting 
changes in intracellular calcium. Cells were cultured in a 
HEPES-buffered  neurobasal  medium  containing  B27, 
penicillin / streptomycin and 2mM Glutamine in 100 mm 
dishes (1.5-2.5×106 cells / dish); they were treated with 
selective serotonin agonists for 2 hours in black-walled, 
clear-base 96-well plates before the calcium assay. The 
assay was performed with the use of a calcium assay kit, 
according to the recommendations of the manufacturer 
(Shimadzu, Japan). Briefly, cells were washed once in 
Hanks balanced saline supplemented with 2.5mM probenecid 
(pH7.4) and incubated with 5 µM fura 2-AM at 37°C for 60 
minutes. Fura 2-AM is light-sensitive, so the tube containing 
the cells was covered with aluminum foil during loading. 
After incubation, cells were immediately placed in a RF-5301

PC  fluorometer  equipped  with  a  multichannel  injector 
(Shimadzu, Japan) and set at λexnm, λem. Fluorescence 
measurements were taken at 0.02intervals before and 
after agonist addition for a total of 60per well. The raw data 
were analysed using the Softmax Pro V software package 
(Shimadzu, Japan). The [Ca2+] values were calculated 
using  Schaeffer’s  method  (Schaeffer  and  Blaustein, 
1989).  Functional  responses  were  measured  as  peak 
fluorescence levels after subtraction of the baseline.

Results
LC-MS analysis 
From MS-MS analysis, there was no identified protein in 
the control (treated with neurobasal medium only). Despite 
this, we identifed 6 membrane proteins in the serotonin 
treated secretome of the rat hypothalamic neurons (Table

due to serotonin signaling in rat hypothalamic cells.

Verification of the expression of selective serotonin 
receptor subtypes by RT-PCR
To verify the results obtained from western blotting of 
neuromodulin, the receptor expression in the hypothalamic 
neuronal cells was subjected to RT-PCR analysis. Using 
gene specified primers and the total RNA extracted from 
the treated cells, we were able to obtain the purified bands 
at the expected sizes.

Inhibitory effect of the Gi-coupled 5-HT1A receptor 
on cAMP production and neuromodulin release
5-HT1A receptor expression in rat hypothalamic neurons 
is known to be lowered by the production of cAMP. We 
further investigated whether 5-HT1A receptor expression 
down-regulated neuromodulin secretion. As shown in Fig. 
1, neuromodulin release was lower than observed after 
5-HT4  receptor  expression.  There  was  a  decrease  in 
intracellular  cAMP  level  following  5-HT1A  receptor

expression compared to 5HT-2 or 5-HT-4 expression (Fig. 
2). It is interesting to note that selective serotonin agonists 
modulated the production of cAMP by GPCR receptor 
regulation of neuromodulin secretion. As shown in Table 
2, it can be stated that selective 5-HT1A agonist decreased 
the intracellular cAMP level. These results indicate that the 
5-HT1A agonist down-regulates the production of cAMP 
negatively, affecting relative neuromodulin secretion.

Effect of the Gs-coupled 5-HT4 receptor on rat 
hypothalamic  neuronal  Ca2+  and  neuromodulin 
release
As shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, when the rat hypothalamus 
was stimulated by the 5-HT4 agonist, the level of [Ca2+] 
increased to 448 nM which provoked PKC signaling and 
the release of neuromodulin. This secreted neuromodulin 
can bind calmodulin and form Ca2+ binding structures 
in the neuronal cells. Table 3 shows that the intracellular 
Ca2+ was increased most by the selective HT2C agonist 
and next by the selective HT4 agonist to regulate PKC 
signaling and neuromodulin secretion.

neurons was able to activate the Ca2+ signaling pathway differentially
from the 5-HT1A receptor.

Disscussion
In  this  study,  we  used  selective  serotonin  agonists  to 
investigate neuromodulin signaling in the rat hypothalamus 
(Bonnin et al, 2006, Wada et al, 2006). 5-HT1A receptor 

HT4 Regulates Neuromodulin in Rat Hypothalamus 81

expression significantly inhibited cAMP production and 
neuromodulin release (Fig. 2) (Liu et al, 2007, O'conner et 
al, 2007). On the contrary, 5-HT4 receptor expression 
activated PKC signaling and increased the intracellular 
Ca2+level as well as neuromodulin secretion. Consequently, 
we focused on the effect of the 5-HT4 receptor agonist on 
neuromodulin secretion in rat hypothalamic neuronal cells. 
Previous  studies  suggested  that  the  regulation  of 
intracellular Ca2+ is important for maintaining neuronal 
plasticity. Calmodulin is involved in maintaining the Ca2+ 
buffering capacity in neuronal cells by establishing the 
Ca2+binding  structure.  Earlier  studies  indicated  that 
neuromodulin has a binding site for calmodulin and forms 
the  Ca2+binding  structure.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  the 
incubation of rat hypothalamic cells with the 5-HT4 agonist 
for  2  hours  activated  neuromodulin  secretion.  These 
results indicate that the selective 5-HT4 receptor affects 
neuromodulin secretion, initiating the signaling of neuronal

Fig.  5.  A  proposed  model:  5-HT1A  receptor  expression  significantly  inhibited  cAMP  production  and 
neuromodulin release. Conversely, 5-HT4 receptor expression activated PKC signaling and increased the
intracellular Ca2+level and neuromodulin secretion. The selective 5-HT2C receptor may affect cAMP 
regulation: this is in accord with the concept that intracellular cAMP levels are responsible for neuromodulin
releasing.

82 Genomics & Informatics   Vol. 5(2) 77-82, June 2007

cells with PKC and Ca2+. This also indicates that the activated 
selective 5-HT2C receptor may affect cAMP regulation, in 
accord with the concept that intracellular cAMP levels are 
responsible for neuromodulin release (Xie et al, 2005). Thus, 
we measured cAMP production using the selective 5-HT2C 
receptor in the treated cells. The results showed that, in the 
presence of GPCR receptor activation, the 5-HT2C receptor 
acts as a strong intracellular inducer of cAMP which is a 
positive regulator of endogenous neuromodulin secretion 
(Fig. 2 and 5) (Cai et al, 2007, Simler et al, 2007). On the 
other hand, 5-HT1A receptor expression alone decreased 
cAMP production in these cells. These results suggest that 
the 5-HT2C receptor might directly affect the activity of 
adenylate cyclase and ATP. The increased levels participate 
in activating Ca2+ signaling and consequently these ions bind 
to  calmodulin  and  neuromodulin.  This  results  in  the 
regulation of Ca2+ buffering in neuronal cells.

In conclusion, the most important result of this study was 
that  selective  5-HT4  receptor  expression  significantly 
activated neuromodulin secretion in rat hypothalamic cells 
(Papageorgiou et al, 2007). This excitatory effect may be 
due  to  the  PKC  and  Ca2+  signaling  in  neuronal  cells. 
Selective 5-HT2C receptor activation increased the intracellular 
cAMP  levels,  thereby  linking  to  the  intracellular  Ca2+ 
mobilization to calmodulin. On the other hand, 5-HT1A 
receptor activation resulted in diminished cAMP production, 
causing decreased neuromodulin secretion in hypothalamic 
neuronal cells. Therefore, it is possible that selective serotonin 
receptor subtypes are involved in the regulation of neuromodulin 
secretion mediated by signaling pathways which utilize Ca2+ 
mediated binding to calmodulin in hypothalamic neuron cells.
