Abstract 
Most of the endogenous retroviral genes integrated into 
the  primate  genome  after  the  split  of  New  World 
monkeys in the Oligocene era,  approximately 33 million 
years  ago.  Because  they  can  change  the  structure  of 
adjacent genes and move between and within chromosomes 
they may play  important roles  in  evolutionas well  as in 
many  kinds  of  disease  and  the  creation  of  genetic 
polymorphism. Comparative analysis of HERVs (human 
endogenous  retroviruses)  and  their LTR  (long  terminal 
repeat) elements in the primate genomes will help us to 
understand the possible impact of HERV elements in the 
evolution  and  phylogeny  of  primates.  For  example, 
HERV-K L TR and SINE-R elements have been identified 
that have been subject to recent change in the course of 
primate  evolution.  They  are  specific  elements  to  the 
human  genome  and  could  be  related  to  biological 
function.  The  HERV-M  element  is  related 
to  the 
superfamily  of  HERV-K  and  is  integrated  into  the 
periphilin gene as the truncated form, 5'L TR-gag-po/-3'L TR. 
PCR  and  RT-PCR  approaches  indicated  that  the 
insertion  of  various  retrotransposable  elements  in  a 
common ancestor genome may make different transcript 
variants in different primate species.  Examination of the 
HERV-W  elementrevealed  that  env  fragments  were 
detected on human chromosomes 1, 3-7,  12, 14, 17, 20, 
and X, whilst the pol fragments were detected on human 
chromosomes 2-8, 10-15, 20, 21, X, andY. Bioinformatic 
blast  search  showed  that  almost  full-length  of  the 
HERV-W family was identified on human chromosomes 
1-8,  11-15,  17,  18,  21,  and  X.  Expression  analysis  of 
HERV-W genes (gag,  pol, and env) in human tissues by 
RT-PCR  indicated that gag and  pol were  expressed  in 
specific tissues, whilst envwas constituitively expressed 
in  all 
tissues  examined.  DNA  sequence  based 
phylogenetic analysis indicated that the gag, pol and env 
independently  during  primate 
genes  have  evolved

expand  the  current  HERV gene  information  of various 
primates and disease tissues.

Introduction 
Human  endogenous  retroviruses  (HERVs)  and  long 
terminal  repeat  (L TR)  like elements are dispersed over 
8% of the whole  human genome (International  Human 
Genome  Sequencing  Consortium,  2001 ).  There  are  at 
least  22  distinct  HERV  families  within  the  human 
genome (Tristem,  2000).  HERVs originate by germ-cell 
infection  of  the  exogenous  retrovirus  during  primate 
evolution  (Lower  et  a/.,  1996).  Full  length  retroviral 
sequences  may 
interact  with  cellular  oncogenes 
(Varmus,  1982)  and  retroviral  LTR  elements  have  the 
capacity to exert a regulatory influence as promoters and 
enhancers of cellular genes (Akopov et at.,  1998; Baust 
et at.,  2000).  Elucidation of the HERV elements should 
provide information about fundamental cellular activities 
and the pathogenesis of multifactorial diseases such as 
cancer and autoimmune disease (Nakagawa et at., 1997; 
Mayer, 2001). 

The HERV-K family of human endogenous retroviral 
sequences  was  originally  cloned  from  Syrian  hamster 
intra-cisternal  A  type  particles  (Ono  eta/.,  1986),  has 
homology  to  mouse  mammary  tumour  virus,  and 
includes  sequences  that  are  expressed  in  normal 
leukemic  cells  (Simon  et  a/.,1994). 
placenta  and 
HERV-K elements probably entered the primate genome 
after the  split of  New World  monkeys  in  the Oligocene 
era, 33-40 million years ago (Steinhuber et at., 1995). It is 
estimated  that  there  are  now  approximately  25,000 
copies of HERV-K L TRs in the human genome, and they 
have randomly transposed across the chromosomes in 
the course of human evolution (Leib-Mosch et at., 1993). 
The  possibility that some of this  increase has occurred 
recently was suggested by the presence of a functional 
integrase in HERV-K sequences (Kitamura et at.,  1996). 
The ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous substitutions 
suggests that evolutionary selection has recently been or 
is  still  operating  (Zsiros  et a/.,  1998).  Medstrand  and 
Mager (1998) have demonstrated that some clusters of 

134  Genomics & Informatics  Vol.  3(4)  133-141, December 2005 

HERV-K L TRs show low (average 1.5%) divergence;  in 
comparisons across primate species,  members of their 
cluster  9  are  specific  to  the  Homo  sapiens.  HERV-K 
LTRs  bind  host  cell  nuclear  proteins  and  have  the 
potential  to  activate  neighboring  genes  (Akopov  eta/., 
1998).  A  possible  role of HERV-K elements  in  disease 
has  been  considered  in  relation  to  insulin  dependent 
diabetes  mellitus  (Conrad  et  a/.,  1997),  seminoma 
(Sauter  et  a/.,  1995)  and  HERV-K-T47D  mammary 
carcinoma  (Seifarth  eta/.,  1998).  Recently,  HERV-M 
(HERV-1<22), the oldest beta retrovirus, was identified in 
the  human  genome.  The  HERV-M  proviral  sequences 
were  detected  in  hominoids,  Old  and  New  World 
monkeys,  but not in  prosimians.  Compared to the other 
HERV-K families, most of their structural genes (gag and 
env) were severely truncated (Lavie et a/.,2004). 

SINE-R retroposons are derived from the endogenous 
retrovirus  HERV-K  family.  SINE-R11,  14,  19  were 
isolated  by  colony  blot  hybridization  using  the  3' long 
terminal  repeat and small  upstream flanking  regions  of 
HERV-K10 as probe (Ono eta/.,  1987). These elements 
entered the genome of hominoid primates after the split 
of Old World monkeys in the Oligocene period (Kim eta/., 
1999a,c,d). The SINE-R.C2 element was discovered in 
relation to a variable number of tandem  repeat (VNTR) 
sequence within the third intron of the gene for C2,  the 
second component of complement, located in class Ill of 
the major histocompatibility complex on the short arm of 
human  chromosome  6  (Carroll  eta/.,  1984;  Zhu  eta/., 
1992).  By Southern blot analysis,  SINE-R.C2 has been 
found to be confined to Homo sapiens (Zhu eta/., 1994). 
Within the Xq21.3 block of homology to Yp11.2 that was 
created in  the course of hominid evolution (Laval  et a/., 
1998), two  retroposons  (HS307 and  HS408) with  92 to 
96% homology to SINE-R.C2 were reported  (Kim eta/., 
1999c). SINE elements have generally arisen either from 
7SL RNA or from tRNA, have been amplified many times 
in the genome, and have become fixed at certain stages 
of  evolution.  They  share  three  prime  sequences  with 
LINE  elements,  which  probably  have  an  earlier 
evolutionary origin, and upon which they may depend for 
the reverse transcriptase activity necessary for retroposition 
(Okada et a/.,  1997). 

A new HERV-Wfamily has been identified by successive 
overlapping eDNA clones  from  multiple sclerosis virion 
(Komurian-Pradel  et a/.,1999).  The  HERV-W has  been 
one of the most widespread investigated HERV elements, 
since  the  isolation  of  a  HERV-W-related  retrovirus 
(MSRV) from retroviral particles produced by cell cultures 
from patients with multiple sclerosis (Perron eta/., 1997). 
The 7q21-22 region of human chromosome 7 has been 
identified as potentially involved in genetic susceptibility 

to multiple sclerosis  (Charmley  et a/.,1991),  contains  a 
RGH  proviral  copy  (HERV-H/RGH)  and  a  complete 
HERV-W proviral  copy (HERV-W/7q).  The  env gene of 
HERV-W/7q encods a protein expressed in fetal tissues 
and  in  placenta  preferentially  (AIIiel  et  a/.,  1998). 
Recently, the HERV-W env protein, syncytin, was found 
to  be  involved  in  placental  morphogenesis  (Mi  eta/., 
2000).  The  major  sites  of  syncytin  expression  were 
placental  syncytiotrophoblasts and  multinucleated cells 
that  originated  from  fetal  trophoblasts.  Here  I  review

implication  of 

HERV-K LTR and SINE-R elements and 
implications for human diseases 
The long terminal  repeat  (L TR)  elements of the human 
endogenous retrovirus HERV-K have been found to be 
present in hominoids and Old World monkeys (Zhu eta/., 
1994), whilst HERV-K LTR-Iike elements were identified 
in  New  World  monkeys  (Kim  eta/.,  1999a,e).  In  the 
human  genome,  several  thousand  copies  of  HERV-K 
L TR  elements  are  found  with  an  essentially  random 
distribution.  Some  of  the  L TR  elements  have  already 
been  identified  using  human  monochromosome  and 
genomic DNAs (Kim and Crow,  1999;  Kim  eta/., 2000), 
whilst additional human-specific HERV-K L TR elements 
were identified from the GenBank database (Medstrand 
and  Mager,  1998)  (AC002350,  AC002400,  AC002508, 
etc.).  All  of these  LTR elements  and the  new HERV-K 
L TR  elements  that  were  transcribed  in  human  brain 
tissue were used to  construct a phylogenetic tree  (Fig. 
1 ). The HERV-K LTR elements were mainly divided into 
two  groups  through  evolutionary  divergence,  although 
note  that  this  is  only  weakly  supported.  The  human(cid:173)
specific HERV-K LTR element (AL034407) has proliferated 
within human chromosome region Xq26 recently (Kim et 
a/.,  2000).  Similarly,  other  HERV-K  LTR  elements 
(AC002350, AC002400, AC002f:IJ8, L47334, U47924, Z80898) 
are only detected in the human genome (Medstand and 
Mager,  1998).  Some  HERV-K LTR  elements  (HKL-B7, 
HKL-B8, HKL-B1 0), identified in human brain eDNA, were 
closely related to human-specific HERV-K L TR elements, 
indicating that they may be  related  to brain function  or 
neuropsychiatric disease. 

SINE-R retroposons,  derived from the HERV-K LTR 
elements (Ono eta/., 1987; Zhu eta/., 1992, 1994), have 
been  found  to  be  hominoid-specific  by  PCR  analysis 
(Kim eta/., 1999a,c). By BLAST search, eDNA prepared 
from the brain of a patient with schizophrenia (GenBank, 
accession no. AA772777) was found to have sequences

containing  a  high  degree  of  homology  with 
SINE-R11, 14, 19(0noeta/., 1987),andwithSINE-R.C2 
(Zhu  eta/.,  1994).  HS307  and  HS408  retroposons  are 
located 
in  Xq21.3  region  of  the  human  genome, 
transposed  to  the  Yp11  after  the  separation  of  the 
chimpanzee and human lineages (Lambson eta/., 1992). 
Both HS307 and HS408 retroposons show a high degree 
of sequence similarity with the schizophrenic brain eDNA 
derived from the postmortem brain tissue from the frontal 
cortex of an individual suffering from schizophrenia who 
committed  suicide  at  the  age  of  34  years  (Yee  et 
a/., 1998). 
Interestingly,  Laval  et  a/.(1998)  showed 
evidence  of  linkage  of  both  psychosis  and  degree  of 
handedness (an index of cerebral asymmetry) to Xq21.3 
region.  Therefore,  in  order  to  explore  the  retroviral 
elements in  Xq21.3  region,  a YAC clone  panel  derived 
from the Xq21.3 region was examined and four HERV-K 
L TR elements found and characterized (Kim and Crow, 
2001).  Two  of  those  elements  (K-X10-5  and  K-X13-1) 
have a high degree of sequence similarity to the human 
specific  HERV-K  LTRs.  Elements  of  the  SINE-R.C2 
class have similarities to the clusters of the HERV-K L TR 
family  (Fig.  2).  SINE-R  retroposons  have a  polypurine 
tract that seNes as a primer binding site for plus-strand 
DNA  synthesis 
from  retrovirally  mediated  reverse 
transcription  (Ono  eta/., 1987).  In  addition,  they have a 
hormone responsive element and enhancer core of the 
HERV-K L TR element although the promoter is deleted. 
These SINE-R retroposons and HERV-K LTR elements 
could  contribute  to  the  structural  change  or  genetic 
variation  associated  with  neuropsychiatric disease and 
primate  evolution.  Akopov  et  a/.  (1998)  noted  that 
HERV-K  sequences  have  the  capacity  to  modify  the 
expression  of  neighboring  genes,  and  suggested  that 

such  modifications  may  have  been  acquired  in  the 
course of  human evolution.  The  HERV-K-T47D-related 
L TR  element  mediates  polyadenylation  of  cellular 
transcripts (Baust eta/., 2000). Two HERV-K LTR elements 
have  been  detected  in  the  human  histocompatibility 
complex locus HLA-DQ (Kambhu eta/., 1990). One L TR 
element  (DQ-L TR3)  of  the  HERV-K  family  at  the 
HLA-DQB1  locus has been associated with  rheumatoid 
arthritis  (Seidl  eta/.,  1999).  An  element  described  as 
almost identical to SINE-R.C2 derived from the HERV-K 
L TR  element  is  the  likely  cause  of  Fukuyama-type 
muscular  dystrophy  (Kobayashi  eta/.,  1998).  Clearly, 
these  HERV-K  L TR  and  SINE-R  elements  deseNe 
further investigation as potential leads to various human 
diseases. 

Molecular characterization  of  HERV-M 
and PPHLN1 hybrid transcripts 
The HERV superfamily is one of the well-known  repeat 
elements in the human genome, and the various families 
were phylogenetically characterized after completion  of 
the  human  genome  project  (Tristem,  2000).  The 
HERV-M family (HERV-K22) was recently identified and 
the  genomic  structure,  localization,  and  phylogenetic 
relationship  of  HERV-M  elements  are 
reviewed 
elsewhere  (Lavie  eta/.,  2004).  However,  the  HERV-M 
located within the  PPHLN1  gene has a disrupted open 
reading  frame  yet  seems  to  overcome  the  situation  of 
functionlessness in the human genome with a gene-like 
transcription 
strategy  during  primate  evolution. 
Generally,  HERV  families  do  not  use  the  donor  and 
acceptor sites like a eukaryoticcell, their PBS (promoter 
binding site) and polyadenylation signals are used during 

Genomic Features of Retroelements and Implications for Human Disease  137 

their transcription.  Phylogenetic analysis  suggests  that 
more than 45 million years was sufficient for changing of 
the  HERV-M  from  a  viral  to  cellular  gene  with  the 
accumulation of mutations. 

The  HERV-M  could  make various  hybrid transcripts 
for  the  PPHLN1  gene  in  coding  regions  with  an 
alternative splicing pattern like a normal eukaryotic gene 
transcript  by  data  base  screening  (EST  and  Refseq 
mRNA data base) with a HERV-M consensus sequence. 
The HERV-M sequence was expressed in human brain, 
prostate,  testis,  heart,  kidney,  liver,  lung,  placenta, 
skeletal  muscle,  spleen,  thymus,  and  uterus,  but not in 
kidney,  liver  or  lung.  However,  RT-PCR  amplification 
suggested it was not detected in as many of the tested 
tissues  in  the  crab-eating  and  squirrel  monkey  being 
absent in testis,  kidney,  liver,  lung,  and spleen  (Huh  et 
a/.,  2005). 

Insertion  and  expression  events  of  the  HERV-M 
elements  seem  to  occur  independently.  Although  the 
insertion of HERV-M happened before the divergence of 
New and Old World monkeys, expression of HERV-M in 
the  PPHLN1 gene has been found only in  humans and 
crab-eating and squirrel monkeys. After the integration of 
HERV-M,  a  series  of  repeat  element  insertions  may 
instability  of  the  primate  genome,  and 
affect  the 
subsequently 
transcription  mechanisms. 
Although  the  exact  mechanism  of  the  PPHLN1  gene 
transcription  related  to  HERV-M  is  not  yet  clear, 
elucidation of such events are likely to provide be a good 
research model of HERV exonization. 

the  gene 

The PPHLN1 gene harbors different repeat elements 
of  HERV-M,  A/usq,  and  L 1 ME4a  within  the  human 
chromosome  12q12  region.  The  insertion  event  of 
HERV-M occurred in New World monkeys approximately 
50  million  years  ago,  and  A/usq  and  L 1 ME4a  were 
inserted into the mammalian genome before the divergence 
of  simian  and  prosimian  lineages  about  60-70  million 
years  ago.  These  data  indicated  that  lineage  specific 
duplication events could have occurred independently. 

Bioinformatic  analysis  and  genomic 
features of the  HERV-W family 
The HERV-W family has been  one of the most broadly 
investigated HERVs during the last few years. It consists 
of  an  estimated  30  to  100  provirus  copies  per  haploid 
human genome and is phylogenetically related to ERV-9 
and  RTLV-H  families.  HERV-W  gag  and  pol  open 
reading  frames  (ORFs)  of  the  family  have  acquired 
frameshifts  and  stop  codons  by  deletions/  insertions, 
whereas  a  complete  env ORF  encoding  an  envelope 
was found on the ci.PH74 placental eDNA clone and on 

the  genomic  RG083M05  clone  (Blond  et  at.,  1999). 
HERV-W may have a chimeric genome structure since 
the murine type C and simian typeD retroviruses show 
strong homology with the pol and env genes, respectively. 
The  HERV-W on  chromosome  7  has  100% identity to 
syncytin  eDNA,  which  is  expressed  specifically  in  the 
syncytiotrophoblast  layer  of  the  placenta  (AIIiel  et a/., 
1998;  Mi  et at.,  2000).  This  observation  implicates the 
potential HERV-W family involvment in human placental 
development. That product of the HERV-W envgene is a 
highly  fusogenic  membrane  glycoprotein  that  induces 
the formation  of syncytia on  interaction with the type  D 
mammalian  retrovirus  receptor  (Blond  et  at.,  2000) 
supports this notion as well as suggesting a direct role in 
human trophoblast cell fusion and differentiation (Frendo 
et at.,  2003).  Recently,  the HERV-W gene product was 
shown  to  block  infection  by  exogenous  retroviruses, 
suggesting that expressed  HERV genes could  have 
beneficialfunctions  to  the  host  (Ponferrada  et  at., 
2003).  The  possibility  that  they  have  relevance  to 
pathogenic  capacity  could  be  subjected  to  change  in 
primate evolution and could be associated with variation 
between different tissues and gene expression. 

The HERV-W families are related to multiple sclerosis(cid:173)
associated  retrovirus  (MSRV)  sequences  identified  in 
particles recovered from monocyte cultures from patients 
with  multiple  sclerosis.Retroviral  sequences  belonging 
to  HERV-W  family  were  also  identified  in  brain  of 
individual  with  schizophrenia,  increasing  the  possibility 
that  HERV-W family  could  be  involved  in  human  brain 
disease  (Karlsson  et  at.,  2001).  Such  HERV-W  env 
families are located on human chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 
7,  12,  14,  17,  20,  and  X  (Kim  and  Lee,  2001),  while 
HERV-W pol families are located on human chromsomes 
2,3,4,5,6, 7,8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,20,21,X,andY 
(Kim,  2001 ).  Within  the  HERV-W family,  env and  pol 
genes  showed  a  high  degree  of  nucleotide  sequence 
similarity (91.6-99.6%), but translation of these sequences 
revealed the presence of both frameshifts and premature 
termination codons caused by deletion/ insertionor point 
mutations in some clones (Kim et at.,  1999b). Outside of 
humans,  the  pol  and  env  gene  sequences  of  the 
HERV-W family were detected by PCR in hominoids and 
Old World monkeys, but not in New World monkeys. The 
HERV-W  family  has  been  phylogenetically  analyzed 
from  the  databases  and  divided  into  three  different 
subfamilies  of  the  human  genome  derived  HERV-W 
group (Costas, 2002). The average divergence between 
sequences  for  each  of  the  subfamilies  indicated  that 
most of the HERV-W elements were inserted within the 
genome during a short period of evolutionary time. 

To date, BLAST search of the DDBJ/EMBUGenBank 

138  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 3(4) 133-141, December 2005 

databases  tor  HERV-W family  reveals  140  sequences 
representing  39  HERV-W  proviruses,  40  full-length 
HERV-W  retroposons,  and  61 
truncated  HERV-W 
retrosequences (Costas, 2002). The number of identified 
HERV-W  related  fragments  comprises  of  at  least  70 
copies  tor  gag  and  30  copies  tor  env  per  haploid 
genome, and is correlated with the increase in complexity 
from envto gag and pro regions as previously described 
(Voisset eta/., 2000). From the 15 HERV-W envgroups 
found  within 
the  human  genome  (Kim  and  Lee, 
2001),one  of  them,  clone  W-7-1  from  chromosome  7, 
showed identical  sequences with  those of brain,  testis, 
kidney,  lung,  placenta,  skeletal  muscle,  and  uterus  of 
normal tissues (WE1-5, WE3-8, WE5-4, WE? -2, WEB-1, 
WE9-3,  WE10-14),  suggesting  that  they  are  actively 
expressed  in  various  normal  tissues  (Vi  eta/.,  2004). 
Other  HERV  families  are  expressed  in  normal  tissues 
and  cancer  cells.  For  example,  HERV-E  family  on 
human chromosome  17q11  was expressed specifically 
in  human  pancreas  and  thyroid  gland  with  two  major 
transcripts, 3.3 and 4.1 kb in size (Shiroma eta/., 2001 ). 
HERV-H  env transcripts  have  been  detected  in  both 
T-cellleukemia cell  lines and lymphocytes from healthy 
blood  donors  by  RT-PCR  (Lindeskog  and  Blomberg, 
1997).  Recently,  the  tissue-specific  expression  of two 
HERVs  transcripts  (HERV-K  cORF!rec  and  HERV-R 
en\!) was found in normal human tissues (kidney, tongue, 
heart, liver, central nervous system) during embryogenesis, 
suggesting  a  possible  role  in  the  development  and 
differentiation of human tissues (Andersson eta/., 2002}. 
In  a  comparative analysis  between  normal  and  cancer 
cells,  the HERV-W gag gene was expressed  in  normal 
brain tissue,  whereas no expression  but not in  PFSK-1 
cancer cells derived from brain tissue. The HERV-W pol 
gene was also expressed  in  prostate tissue,  but  not  in 
PC3 cancer cells derived from prostate tissue (Vi  eta/., 
2004).  In  the  case  of  the  HERV-E  env gene,  it  was 
actively expressed in prostate carcinoma tissues and cell 
lines,  but  not  in  normal  prostate  tissues  and  cells  as 
detected  by  RT-PCR,  RNA  in  situ  hybridization,  and 
Northern  blot  hybridization  (Wang-Johanning  et  a/., 
2003).  No  expression  of  the  HERV-E  env gene  was 
detected in breast tissues, but in contrast,  HERV-K env 
transcripts were detected in most breast cancer cell lines 
and many breast tumor tissues (Wang-Johanning eta/., 
2002).  Such  HERV-K  gag  transcripts  were  found  in 
gonocytes  of  all  genadoblastomas  and  in  neoplastic 
germ cell tumours whilst the transcriptional activity of the 
HERV-K gag gene was 5- to 10-told higher in blood cells 
of  leukemia  patients  than  in  normal  cells  (Depil  eta/., 
2002}. 

Whilst  products  of  the  HERV-W  env  gene  are 

implicated  in  a  direct  role  in  human  trophoblast  cell 
fusion  and  differentiation (Frendo  eta/.,  2003)  and,  via 
blocking the infection by an exogenous retrovirus, mayhave 
beneficial  function  to  the  host  (Ponterrada,  2003),  the 
relationship  of  HERV  elements  in  general  and  human 
diseases remains contraversial.  Reports of detection of 
various HERV mRNA, HERV proteins, and even HERV 
particles  in  human  diseases,  especially  cancer,  are 
becoming numerous, but remain correlative. The HERV-W 
envgene sequences have been characterizedin some 
human cancer cell  lines to examine the role of HERV in 
human  cancer  (Vi  et a/.,  2002)  and  to  investigate  the 
comparative  analysis  of  HERV-W  families  between 
humans  and  monkeys 
tissue 
distribution, evolution, and phylogenetic relationships (Vi  et 
at., 2003).  In biointormatic analysis, a BLASTN query on 
the  EST  (expressed  sequence  tag)  database  with 
HERV-W showed  multiple transcripts in various human 
tissues such as bladder, brain, breast, colon, hypothalamus, 
kidney,  liver,  lung,  ovary,  parathyroid,  placenta,  prostate, 
skin,  stomach,  testis,  and  uterus  (data  not  shown), 
supporting that HERV-W families could have a biological 
role  in  multiple  human  tissues.  Taken  together,  these 
data  suggest  that  some  recently  proliferated  and 
expressed HERV-W families are active in the genome of 
tissues and cancer cells,  and that they therefore could 
have a functional role in human tissues and cancer cells.
