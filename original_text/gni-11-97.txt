The editorial committee of Genomics & Informatics has concluded that a substantial portion of the above article [1] was 
‘copied and pasted’ from earlier publications without appropriate attribution. Although the plagiarized texts are detected 
only in the Introduction section [2], such a misconduct is unacceptable in a scientific writing. The authors have acknowledged 
plagiarism in the above article and requested retraction.
