Pathogenic bacteria survive in iron-limited host environments by using several iron acquisition mechanisms. Acinetobacter 
baumannii, causing serious infections in compromised patients, produces an iron-chelating molecule, called acinetobactin, 
which is composed of equimolar quantities of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), L-threonine, and N-hydroxyhistamine, to 
compete with host cells for iron. Genes that are involved in the production and transport of acinetobactin are clustered 
within the genome of A. baumannii. A recent study showed that entA, located outside of the acinetobactin gene cluster, 
plays important roles in the biosynthesis of the acinetobactin precursor DHBA and in bacterial pathogenesis. Therefore, 
understanding the genes that are associated with the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin in the bacterial genome is 
required. This review is intended to provide a general overview of the genes in the genome of A. baumannii that are required 
for acinetobactin biosynthesis and transport.

Introduction

Iron is one of the essential nutrients for host and pathogenic 
bacteria, and both require the metal as a cofactor or as a 
prosthetic group for biologically important proteins that are 
involved in many basic cellular functions [1]. Most iron in 
the mammalian host is sequestered and bound to high-affinity 
iron-binding proteins, such as transferrin, lactoferrin, and 
ferritin,  or  complexed  to  the  heme  of  hemoproteins  [2]. 
Hence, iron is rarely found as free iron in the mammalian 
host and is one of the major limiting factors of pathogenic 
bacteria.  Therefore,  pathogenic  bacteria  have  evolved  so-
phisticated mechanisms for the acquisition of iron from host 
tissues  because  of  the  limited  availability  of  iron  to  the 
bacteria and the inevitable competition with the host [3-8]. 
Siderophores are high-affinity iron-chelating compounds 
secreted by pathogenic bacteria [3]. Siderophores are classified 
into  three  major  groups−catecholates,  hydroxamates,  and 
carboxylates−by  the  ligands  that  are  used  to  chelate  the 

ferric  iron  [7].  The  diversity  of  siderophores  may  have 
resulted from evolutionary pressure, causing the bacteria to 
produce structurally different siderophores that can not be 
transported by specific transport systems of other bacteria. 
For example, Escherichia coli produces a prototype catechol 
siderophore, which is a cyclic trimer of 2,3-dihydroxyben-
zoyl-L-serine [5]. In comparison, vibriobactin, produced by 
Vibrio cholera, is a non-cyclic derivative of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic 
acid (DHBA) [9]. Genes that are involved in the biosynthesis 
and uptake of siderophores are often clustered within the 
bacterial genome, and their products are closely linked to the 
virulence of pathogenic bacteria.

Like the pathogenesis of many other bacteria, the patho-
genesis  of  Acinetobacter  baumannii,  a  major  opportunistic 
pathogen  that  causes  serious  diseases  in  compromised 
patients,  including  pneumonia,  bacteremia,  urinary  tract 
infection, sepsis, and meningitis [10, 11], depends primarily 
on the organism’s ability to uptake and utilize iron [12-14]. 
Numerous studies have investigated the response of various 
A. baumannii isolates in iron-limited conditions and identified

several gene clusters that are required for the synthesis and 
transport of siderophores [15]. Especially, the acinetobac-
tin-mediated  iron  acquisition  system  has  been  the  most 
extensively characterized system in A. baumannii [16, 17]. 
Acinetobactin, a catechol-hydroxamate siderophore, which 
is a non-cyclic derivative of DHBA that is linked to threonine 
and N-hydroxyhistamine, is produced and utilized by three 
putative  systems  encoded  within  the  acinetobactin  gene 
cluster of A. baumannii. Moreover, A. baumannii strains have 
significant  genetic  diversity  in  the  numbers  and  types  of 
these iron uptake and utilization systems [15]. Therefore, 
these results indicate that genetic diversity in acinetobactin 
gene  clusters  could  be  a  major  factor  in  determining  the 
virulence  among  A.  baumannii  strains.  In  this  review,  we 
describe a gene cluster in the genome of A. baumannii that is 
involved in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin. 
Furthermore, we present the genetic diversity of the gene 
cluster that is responsible for acinetobactin biosynthesis and 
transport in different A. baumannii strains.

Acinetobactin Gene Cluster in A. baumannii

A. baumannii express high-affinity iron acquisition systems, 
such  as  siderophores,  to  survive  under  iron-limited  host 
environments. The iron acquisition system that is mediated 
by  the  siderophore  acinetobactin  has  been  extensively 
characterized in A. baumannii. Especially, the gene cluster 
involved in the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  1,  2015

has been found in various clinical isolates of A. baumannii, 
except A. baumannii SDF [15]. Acinetobactin is synthesized 
from a DHBA, threonine, and hydroxyhistamine via proteins 
encoded by genes within the gene cluster. The mixed-type 
siderophore, which consists of catecholate and hydroxamate 
groups, exhibits high affinity for iron [16, 17]. Particularly, it 
has been found that 18 coding regions in the chromosome of 
A.  baumannii  ATCC  19606  are  required  for  acinetobactin 
biosynthesis  and  the  uptake  of 
ferric-acinetobactin 
complexes  [15,  18].  The  acinetobactin  gene  cluster  of  A. 
baumannii  ATCC  19606  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The 
acinetobactin-mediated iron acquisition system is composed 
of three putative systems encoded within the acinetobactin 
cluster.  First,  the  biosynthesis  of  acinetobactin 
is 
accomplished by the proteins encoded by basA, basB, basC, 
basD, basF, basG, basH, basI, and basJ [14, 15]. Second, the 
acinetobactin that is produced by A. baumannii is secreted via 
a  siderophore  efflux  system  of  the  ABC  superfamily, 
consisting of the proteins encoded by barA and barB [18]. 
Finally, ferric-acinetobactin complexes move into bacterial 
cells  via  a  receptor  for  ferric-acinetobactin  complexes, 
consisting of the proteins encoded by bauA, bauB, bauC, bauD, 
bauE, and bauF [14]. Especially, bauB, bauC, bauD, and bauE 
play 
of 
ferric-acinetobactin complexes into bacterial cells [15]. In 
addition, putative binding sites for ferric uptake regulator, 
which  controls  bacterial  iron  homeostasis,  exist  in  the 
upstream regions of basJ, entE/basD, basA/bauF, and bauD/basD.

T Hasan,  et  al.  Acinetobactin of Acinetobacter baumannii 

All of these genes that are involved in the biosynthesis and 
transport  of  acinetobactin  are  significantly  up-regulated 
under iron-limited conditions [15]. Particularly, a functional 
analysis of basD, bauA, and bauD mutants under iron-limited 
conditions showed that iron acquisition that is mediated by 
the biosynthesis and transport of acinetobactin is essential 
for the survival of A. baumannii under iron-limited conditions 
[13].

Moreover, a recent study by Gaddy et al. [13] indicated that 
BasD and BauA play important roles in the persistence of 
infection by  A.  baumannii  within epithelial cells  and their 
apoptotic death. The results obtained from a mouse sepsis 
model  also  showed  that  the  acinetobactin-mediated  iron 
acquisition system is a major factor in the pathogenesis of A. 
baumannii, such as the establishment of bacterial infection 
and cell damage. Especially, impairment of BasD production 
resulted in an intermediate virulence phenotype in ex vivo 
and in vivo infection models in comparison to those of the 
parental strain and bauA  mutant. These results represent 
that both acinetobactin synthesis and uptake of iron-acine-
tobactin complexes are absolutely required for the pathogenesis 
of A. baumannii.

Genetic  Diversity  of  Acinetobactin  Gene 
Cluster in Different A. baumannii Strains

Penwell et al. [18] described that the gene cluster that is 
involved  in  acinetobactin  production  and  its  utilization 
exists in the chromosomes of different A. baumannii strains. 
In addition, the gene cluster is found in A. baumannii AYE, 
which  is  a  natural  entA  mutant  incapable  of  producing 
acinetobactin [18, 19]. However, the cognate clusters in the 
A.  baumannii  AB0057  and  ACICU  strains  contain  the 
additional putative genes AB57_2807 and AB57_2818 [20], 
and  ACICU_02575  and  ACICU_02586  [21],  respectively 
(Fig.  1).  In  the  case  of  A.  baumannii  AB307-294,  three 
additional predicted genes, ABBFA_001054, ABBFA_001053, 

and ABBFA_001065, are also added in the bas-bau-bar gene 
cluster  (Fig.  1)  [20].  Although  the  functions  of  these 
additional genes in siderophore production and its utilization 
are not characterized, these results indicate the possibility 
that genetic diversity in acinetobactin gene clusters could be 
closely linked to the virulence of A. baumannii.

entA Ortholog in A. baumannii

Enterobactin that is produced by E. coli is a high-affinity 
siderophore for iron [5]. In the enterobactin biosynthesis, 
chorismic acid is converted to DHBA by the products of entA, 
entB, and entC. An amide linkage of DHBA to L-serine (Ser) 
is then catalyzed by the proteins encoded by entD, entE, entF, 
and entB. The molecules of the DHBA-Ser that is formed 
undergo  intermolecular  cyclization,  yielding  enterobactin. 
A.  baumannii  also  employs  basF  and  basJ  within  the 
acinetobactin gene cluster, which are homologs of entC and 
entB,  respectively,  to  produce  mature  acinetobactin  [18]. 
However, entA has not been found in the acinetobactin gene 
cluster. Recently, it was found that a single functional copy of 
an  entA  ortholog  is  located  in  anupstream  region  of  the 
modE-modA-modB-modC gene cluster that is required for the 
molybdenum transport system in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 
(Fig. 2) [18]. In particular, a functional analysis based on 
gene  cloning  and  biochemical  tests  showed  that  entA  is 
absolutely required for the production of DHBA, which is 
used  by  A.  baumannii  as  a  precursor  for  acinetobactin 
biosynthesis.  The  study  also  demonstrated  that  acineto-
bactin intermediates and DHBA play important roles in the 
virulence  of  A.  baumannii  in  ex  vivo  and  in  vivo  infection 
models. 

Even though entA is found outside of the acinetobactin 
cluster in A. baumannii strains, the genetic contents surroun-
ding  the  entA  gene  are  variable  among  different  clinical 
isolates [18]. For example, the entA gene of A. baumannii 
ATCC 19606 is next to the coding regions of the mod gene 

Fig.  2.  Genetic  map  of  the  gene  cluster  containing  the  entA  ortholog.  The  arrows  represent  the  coding  regions  of  the  genes  identified
in  the  genomes  of  Acinetobacter  baumannii  ATCC  19606  and  ATCC  17978.  The  names  of  the  genes  are  shown  above  each  coding 
region.

cluster  (Fig.  2).  However,  the  entA  gene  of  A.  baumannii 
ATCC  17978  is  situated  within  a  large  gene  cluster  that 
encodes  an  uncharacterized  siderophore-mediated  system 
(Fig.  2).  Especially,  this  cluster,  in  which  mobile  DNA 
elements exist, is flanked by inverted repeats, a feature that 
can explain its transfer by lateral processes. Therefore, these 
results represent that genetic components that are required 
for iron acquisition via the acinetobactin-mediated system 
give rise to horizontal gene transfer with complex chromo-
somal  rearrangement  processes.  Consequently,  the  newly 
added  siderophore  gene  cluster  with  the  entA  gene  via 
horizontal gene transfer may cause these two strains, ATCC 
19606  and  ATCC  17978,  to  acquire  iron  via  different 
siderophore-mediated systems from different sources. The 
possibility  was  proven  by  a  genomic  analysis  of  fully 
sequenced and annotated A. baumannii isolates [15, 19]. Four 
siderophore gene clusters are newly predicted to be involved 
in siderophore production and the uptake of iron-siderophore 
complexes (Table 1). Cluster 1 is indicated in the genomes of 
all strains analyzed, with the exception of A. baumannii 8399. 
Cluster 2 and cluster 4 are found only in A. baumannii ATCC 
17978 and isolate 8399, respectively. Cluster 5 is present in 
all genomes analyzed except for that of A. baumannii ATCC 
17978. The possibility is also supported by the result that the 
iron uptake phenotype of the A. baumannii ATCC 17978 basD 
mutant was not different from that of the parental 17978 
strain when compared under iron-limited conditions.

Conclusion

A. baumannii employs specialized systems that are required 
for iron acquisition in iron-limited host environments [16]. 
In this review, we described the genes of A. baumannii that are 
involved  in  acinetobactin  biosynthesis  and  transport.  A 
number of studies have identified the genes that are essential

for iron acquisition [13, 15-17]. Especially, the data presented 
in this review indicate that A. baumannii strains have genetic 
diversity in the acinetobacter gene cluster. Even though the 
roles  of  the  additional  genes  in  acinetobactin  cluster  in 
different.  A.  baumannii  strains  are  not  characterized,  we 
suggest that the genes could be associated with A. baumannii 
virulence. Therefore, functional analysis of the genes in the 
bacteria is required. Furthermore, we showed both a single 
entA  functional  ortholog  and  variability  in  the  bacterial 
genome.  Therefore,  we  suggest  that  A.  baumannii  has 
continuously  evolved  the  iron  acquisition  mechanism, 
which  is  associated  with  acinetobactin  from  different 
sources by horizontal gene transfer.
