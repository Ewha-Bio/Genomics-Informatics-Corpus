Extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL), is a malignant disorder of cytotoxic lymphocytes of NK or 
T  cells.  It  is  an  aggressive  neoplasm  with  a  very  poor  prognosis.  Although  extranodal  NKTCL  reportedly  has  a  strong 
association with Epstein-Barr virus, the molecular pathogenesis of NKTCL has been unexplored. The recent technological 
advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made DNA sequencing cost- and time-effective, with more reliable 
results.  Using the  Ion  Proton Comprehensive Cancer  Panel, we sequenced 409  cancer-related genes  to identify  somatic 
mutations in five NKTCL tissue samples. The sequencing analysis detected 25 mutations in 21 genes. Among them, KMT2D, 
a histone modification-related gene, was the most frequently mutated gene (four of the five cases). This result was consistent 
with recent NGS studies that have suggested KMT2D as a novel driver gene in NKTCL. Mutations were also found in ARID1A, 
a chromatin remodeling gene, and TP53, which also recurred in recent NGS studies. We also found mutations in 18 novel 
candidate genes, with molecular functions that were potentially implicated in cancer development. We suggest that these 
genes may result in multiple oncogenic events and may be used as potential bio-markers of NKTCL in the future.

Introduction

Extranodal  natural  killer  (NK)/T-cell  lymphoma,  nasal 
type (NKTCL) is a malignant neoplasm characterized by a 
cytotoxic  phenotype  and  is  associated  with  Epstein-Barr 
virus (EBV) infection. It is rare in Western countries but is 
the most common subtype of mature T and NK cell neo-
plasms in Asia [1]. Although it has been suggested that EBV 
could play a pathogenic role in the development of NKTCL, 
its  etiology  and  molecular  pathogenesis  have  remained 
unexplained. 

The clinical course of NKTCL is usually highly aggressive, 
but its survival rate has improved with the recent progress in 
intensive therapies, including combined chemoradiotherapy 

and autologous bone marrow transplantation [2, 3]. However, 
the prognosis of NKTCL is variable, and the recurrence rate 
is still high. Thus, there is a great need to define a molecular 
pathway  associated  with  the  pathogenesis,  prognosis,  or 
drug resistance of NKTCL.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has made 
genetic and molecular studies effective, with more reliable 
results achieved [4]. High-throughput sequencing technology 
can  conduct  millions  of  sequencing  reactions  in  parallel. 
Unlike in Sanger sequencing, NGS enables the detection of 
novel genetic alterations, since the sequence of every base in 
the region of interest is detected, and a large number of loci 
of interest (multiple genes) can be analyzed in a single panel. 
It is currently used in a wide variety of research fields. For 
example, it has been used to identify mutations or to profile

gene expressions in cancer research and has been utilized in 
population genomic studies, including the 1000 Genomes 
Project. 

Recent  advancements  in  NGS  technology  have  revolu-
tionized  clinical  research.  Moreover,  the  emergence  of 
bench-top sequencers, such as the Ion Proton platform, has 
allowed genomic and molecular studies to be done easily and 
effectively  by  individual  researchers  and  institutes.  Now-
adays, many molecular studies on the cancer genome are 
being performed using NGS. The detection of mutations or 
gene expression in mixed samples requires high sequencing 
depth, which is not achieved by whole-genome “shotgun” 
approaches. Targeted sequencing is able to yield a desirable 
sequencing depth for this purpose. Thus, it is more efficient 
to identify mutations correlating with tumor phenotype and 
in developing possible targeted drug therapies. Yet, mole-
cular studies using NGS in NKTCL have languished com-
pared  with  B-cell  lymphoma  cases  [5-9].  Therefore,  this 
study aims to identify mutations possibly responsible for 
NKTCL  using  targeted  sequencing  with  a  comprehensive 
panel of 409 cancer-related genes (Supplementary Fig. 1) 
and to suggest candidate genes that can be used as potential 
bio-markers of NKTCL in the future. 

Methods
Clinical information

Samples from tumors diagnosed between 2011 and 2014 
were collected from Dankook University Hospital (Cheonan) 
in South Korea. Five formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded 
(FFPE) tumor samples from NKTCL were analyzed. NKTCL 
was diagnosed according to the 2008 World Health Orga-
nization  classification  [10].  In  all  cases,  immunohisto-
chemical studies for CD3, CD56, and granzyme B, as well as 
EBV-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization, were carried 
out with the FFPE tissues. All immunohistochemical results 
were positive for the markers, but one case was negative for 
EBV (Supplementary Fig. 2). Patient ages ranged from 46 to 
80 years. One case was from the submandibular region. The 
remainder was from the nasal cavity. Supplementary Table 1 
summarizes the information of the enrolled subjects. 

DNA preparation

FFPE tissue samples were deparaffinized in xylene, and 3- 
to 5-mm thick sections were extracted from the samples. 
Using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 
we isolated genomic DNA from the samples following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. The quality control results of 
the  DNA  preparations  are  illustrated  in  Supplementary 
Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3.

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

Library preparation and Ion Proton sequencing

Targeted gene sequencing was performed as previously 
described [11]. Ten nanograms of the DNA preparations was 
used as a template for multiplex polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)  of  a  409-gene  panel  covering  coding  regions  (Ion 
AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel; Life Technologies, 
Grand Island, NY, USA).

Fragment  libraries  were  constructed  by  DNA  fragmen-
tation,  barcode  and  adaptor  ligation,  and  library  ampli-
fication using the Ion DNA Barcoding kit (Life Technologies) 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The  size 
distribution  of  the  DNA  fragments  was  analyzed  using  a 
bioanalyzer  and  the  High  Sensitivity  kit  (Agilent,  Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). Using the Ion Xpress Template kit (Life 
Technologies), we performed template preparation, emulsion 
PCR, and Ion Sphere Particle (ISP) enrichment according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions. The ISPs were loaded onto 
a P1 chip and sequenced using an Ion P1 sequencing kit (Life 
Technologies). 

Variant calling and annotation

Ion  Proton  platform-specific  pipeline  software  (Proton 
Suite  v4.4;  Life  Technologies)  was  used  to  separate  the 
barcoded reads, generate sequence alignments with the hg19 
human genome reference, perform target-region coverage 
analysis, and filter poor signal reads. Initial variant calls were 
generated using Proton Suite with a plug-in program (variant 
caller  v4.4).  Variant  calls  were  further  analyzed  using 
internally developed software that allows variant filtering 
and  annotation  using  refGene  in  University  of  California 
Santa Cruz (UCSC), 1000 Genomes, COSMIC v.67, dbSNP 
build 138, and ExAC. To minimize false positives, variants 
were filtered with a normal population variant database, The 
Korean Personal Genome Project (http://opengenome.net/) 
[12]. 

Candidate variant detection (variant filtering)

To filter out false-positives, which were hardly regarded as 
true somatic mutations or disease driver mutations, we used 
several additional filtering steps that are generally accepted 
and generated the final variant calls, as shown in Fig. 1. They 
included (1) transition-type point mutation; (2) indel ＞2 
bp; (3) normal variants of Inhouse, 1000 Genomes Project, 
and ExAC_est_Asia (Broad Institute); (4) homozygous-type 
mutation;  (5)  conservation  ＜0.3;  (6)  regions  except  for 
missense, splice site, stop gained, and frameshift; (7) total 
depth ＜100; and (8) altered allele frequency ＞0.3 or ＜0.05 
[13].

Variant interpretation

To evaluate which mutation could be actionable or those 
to prioritize, a literature review was done, as was a search for 
gene function, in some online databases and gene ontology 
analyses [14-19]. 

Sanger sequencing

To validate candidate loci, we conducted PCR amplification 
and  Sanger  sequencing.  A  primer  pair  for  the  PCR  am-
plification was designed in the flanking region of each target 
locus using OligoCalc (http://www.basic.northwestern.edu/ 
biotools/oligocalc.html) and Oligo Analysis Tools (http:// 
www.operon.com/tools/oligo-analysis-tool.aspx). Detailed 
information on the primers is summarized in Supplementary 
Table 3. PCR was performed in 20 μL of the reaction mixture, 
including 10 μL of 2× EF-Taq Pre mix4 (Biofact, Daejeon, 

Korea), 10 μM of oligonucleotide primers, 1 μL of template, 
and nuclease-free water. PCR was carried out as follows: first 
denaturation step of 3 min at 95oC, followed by 25 cycles of 
30  s  at  95oC,  annealing  of  30  s  at  optimal  temperature, 
extension of 40 s to 1 min depending on PCR product size at 
72oC, and a final extension for 2 min at 72oC. PCR products 
were confirmed by gel electrophoresis and purified with a 
PCR  purification  kit  (Favorgen  Biotech  Corp.,  Pingtung 
Country, Taiwan). Products were sequenced using an ABI3500 
genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, 
USA). Sequencing data were aligned with exome sequencing 
data by the Bioedit program. 

Results
Sequencing data and mapping statistics

Supplementary Table 4 summarizes the sequencing data 
and mapping statistics. The length of the target regions (base 
pairs, bp) corresponding to the 409 genes was 1,688,650 bp. 
The total number of mapped reads was 23,172,100, and the 
average depth of coverage was 1,432×. 

Variant types, regions, and single-nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP)  variant  forms  of  each  sample  are  shown  in  Supp-
lementary Table 5 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5, res-
pectively. A total of 7,314 variants were detected in the five 
samples,  and  the  number  of  variants  identified  in  each 
sample ranged from 881 to 4,099. As shown in Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5, most of the SNPs were transition-type (6,344 out 
of a total of 7,314 variants).

As  a  result  of  the  filtering  steps  described  above,  22 
variants in 25 loci were detected (Table 1). All cases showed 
one  (case  No.  3)  to  14  variants  (case  No.  2).  The  lysine 
[K]-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) gene showed 
the identical SNP variant (missense mutation) in four samples 
(cases Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5). Two different variants for the 
MYH9 gene were identified in one sample (case No. 2). Most 
of the variants were missense mutations, except for two stop 
gained variants for ATR and MBD1 and one frameshift variant 
for FLT4. 

Variant interpretation

The genes were classified into two groups: likely action-
able and unknown significance. The likely actionable group 
was confined to the genes with a mutation in NKTCL, which 
has previously and recurrently been identified. Three genes 
were classified as likely actionable: KMT2D, AT-rich inte-
ractive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A), and TP53. 
The other group was classified as the unknown significance 
groupivarious  functions  can  be  present,  with  molecular 
function  potentially  implied  in  cancer  development.  The 
variant  interpretation  results  are  summarized  in  Table  2.

Based  on  their  functional  categories,  the  transcription 
regulation-related gene group, which included four genes 
related to chromatin modification, was the most common 
gene  group  (eight  genes).  This  was  followed  by  a  group 
comprising five genes related to transcription factor/signal 
transduction.

Sanger sequencing

To confirm the 25 loci, we tried to amplify them using PCR 
analysis. However, only six loci were successfully amplified 
in two samples (cases Nos. 1 and 5), due to severe DNA 
damage in the FFPE samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). We 
conducted Sanger sequencing of the PCR products. Only one 
out of the six loci was authentic; one sample (case No. 5) 
contained a missense mutation (c.3592A＞T, p.M1198L) in 
the BCR gene (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Discussion

To identify somatic mutations of NKTCL, this study used 
NGS technology, which revealed 25 mutations from 21 genes 
in  five  cases.  Three  genes  were  classified  as  the  likely 
actionable group: KMT2D, ARID1A, and TP53. In particular, 
KMT2D, also known as MLL2, showed the same variant in 
four cases. Somatic mutations of KMT2D, ARID1A, and TP53 

in NKTCL were recurrently reported in recent studies using 
NGS [20-22]. In these studies, KMT2D was one of the most 
frequently  mutated  genes,  together  with  STAT3,  BCOR, 
DDX3X, TP53, and ARID1A. These genes were suggested as 
novel driver genes in the development of NKTCL. We could 
not  identify  the  mutational  status  of  STAT3,  BCOR,  or 
DDX3X, due to the absence of these genes from our cancer 
panel list.

The KMT2D gene encodes a histone methyltransferase, is 
classified in the chromatin modification group, and plays an 
important  role  in  regulating  gene  transcription.  Somatic 
mutations in the KMT2D gene have been identified in certain 
cancers  [23,  24].  Most  of  these  mutations  result  in  an 
abnormally short, nonfunctional histone methyltransferase 
that cannot perform its role as a tumor suppressor, resulting 
in the development of cancer. In one of the reports described 
above, a loss-of-function mutation in KMT2D was identified 
by  RNA  sequencing.  The  result  supports  the  idea  that 
KMT2D may be a tumor suppressor gene in the development 
of  NKTCL  and  could  be  a  potential  therapeutic  target. 
Mutations in this gene were also found in other lymphomas, 
including  relapsed  diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma,  mantle 
cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma [25-27]. In follicular 
lymphoma, an integrated genomic analysis identified early 
driver mutations in the KMT2D gene, together with other

chromatin regulator genes. 

Mutations in the ARID1A gene have been found in many 
types  of  cancers,  including  ovarian  carcinoma,  gastric 
carcinoma,  mantle  cell  lymphoma,  and  pediatric  Burkitt 
lymphoma  [24,  26,  28,  29].  We  identified  a  mutation  in 
ARID1A  in  one  out  of  the  five  cases.  The  ARID1A  gene 
encodes a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several 
different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes 
regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as 
chromatin remodeling. The mechanism by which mutations 
in  the  ARID1A  gene  contribute  to  cancer  is  unknown, 
although it is thought that changes in SWI/SNF complexes 
are involved. These changes may disrupt the regulation of 
genes  that  help  control  the  growth  and  division  of  cells, 
which lead to cancer [30].

TP53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene. The encoded 
protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate the 
expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, 
apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. 
We found a mutation in TP53 in one out of the five cases. 
Mutations in TP53 have been described in NKTCL at various 
proportions,  suggesting  some  racial,  environmental,  or 

lifestyle differences as a possible cause of tumorigenesis, and 
appear to correlate with more advanced-stage disease [31-33]. 
In other lymphoma studies using NGS, including pediatric 
Burkitt lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma, mutations in 
TP53 were also frequently found [26, 29]. 

In  summary,  the  likely  actionable  group,  consisting  of 
KMT2D and ARID1A, in addition to TP53, seems to contain 
frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes in the develo-
pment of NKTCL, considering their function and the pre-
vious literature. It is likely that other genetic changes, in 
addition to mutations in these genes, are necessary for the 
development of this disease. 

The other genes (unknown significance group) showed a 
varied functional spectrum. Like the likely actionable group, 
most of these genes may have a role as tumor suppressors, 
considering their molecular function: chromatin modification 
(SETD2  and  KAT6B),  transcriptional  regulator  (MBD1, 
BCL11B, ZNF521, and PER1), regulation of cytokinesis and 
structural integrity (CDH11, MYH9, and SYNE1), and DNA 
damage  checkpoint  (ATR).  Additional  RNA  sequencing 
could reveal the functional status (gene expression status) of 
these genes.

In  contrast  to  the  genes  described  above,  most  of  the 
remaining genes might be related to activating mutations. 
The majority of these genes is related to transcription factors 
and  signal  transduction  (ERG,  IKBKB,  FGFR1,  BCR,  and 
MYH11). Other genes are related to angiogenesis (FLT4 and 
THBS1) and RNA metabolism (SBDS). In particular, ERG 
(case No. 1), MYH11 (case No. 2), and BCR (case No. 3) 
showed the highest allele frequency in each case, and BCR 
was the only gene that showed a missense mutation result in 
Sanger  sequencing.  But  until  now,  genetic  alterations  of 
these three genes in NKTCL have not been described, and it 
is  difficult  to  infer  their  molecular  function  or  impact  in 
NKTCL, considering their known function up to now. 

As described above, this study did not complete Sanger 
sequencing validation due to severe DNA degradation of the 
FFPE samples. Although Sanger sequencing is still considered 
the standard technology for the validation of NGS, it has 
several limitations. It is insensitive to alterations that occur 
at an allele frequency lower than approximately 20% [34]. In 
cancer research, histological variables, such as tumor purity, 
tumor heterogeneity or subclonality, and the ploidy of the 
tumor cells, within a sample could signiﬁcantly affect the 
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of DNA sequencing [35]. However, 
targeted sequencing with very high sequence coverage, like 
in this study, allows for the detection of lower-abundance 
(low  allele  frequency)  somatic  variants  and  thus  reveals 
clinically useful information from stromally contaminated or 
heterogeneous tumor samples [36]. In this study, the allele 
frequency of the variants ranged from 5.0% to 27.1%, and 
only three variants showed an allele frequency of over 20%. 
As a result, Sanger sequencing was not appropriate for the 
validation of the mutations in this study. 

Because this study involved only five cases, it is difficult to 
define their mutational spectrum. But, the majority of the 
genes could be grouped as tumor suppressor genes. Previous 
NKTCL  studies  have  reported  some  activating  mutations 
[37-40] and deregulated gene expression in various oncogenic 
pathways [41-43]. This study revealed no mutations in onco-
genes that have been reported in previous mutation studies 
or gene expression studies in NKTCL. However, this study 
result may imply that the mutations of some tumor suppressor 
genes  and  genes  involved  in  transcriptional  regulation, 
transcription factors, and signal transduction may have a role 
as a trigger, resulting in additional oncogenic events in some 
pathways and oncogenes in the development of NKTCL and 
disease  manifestation.  We  suggest  that  these  candidate 
genes may be used as potential bio-markers for this disease 
in the future. Further studies of transcriptomic alterations 
and functional analyses could help identify the molecular 
function, nature, and clinical significance of these candidate 
genes in NKTCL and could accelerate the attainment of the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

goal of personalized medicine based on the genetic alterations 
in each patient.
