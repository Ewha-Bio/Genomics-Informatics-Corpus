Understanding complex relationships among heterogeneous biological data is one of the fundamental goals in biology. In 
most cases, diverse biological data are stored in relational databases, such as MySQL and Oracle, which store data in multiple 
tables and then infer relationships by multiple-join statements. Recently, a new type of database, called the graph-based 
database, was developed to natively represent various kinds of complex relationships, and it is widely used among computer 
science communities and IT industries. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a graph-based database for complex 
biological relationships by comparing the performance between MySQL and Neo4j, one of the most widely used graph 
databases. We collected various biological data (protein-protein interaction, drug-target, gene-disease, etc.) from several 
existing  sources, removed duplicate and  redundant data, and finally constructed a  graph database  containing 114,550 
nodes and 82,674,321 relationships. When we tested the query execution performance of MySQL versus Neo4j, we found 
that Neo4j outperformed MySQL in all cases. While Neo4j exhibited a very fast response for various queries, MySQL exhibited 
latent or unfinished responses for complex queries with multiple-join statements. These results show that using graph-based 
databases, such as Neo4j, is an efficient way to store complex biological relationships. Moreover, querying a graph database 
in diverse ways has the potential to reveal novel relationships among heterogeneous biological data.

Introduction

The  rapid  development  of  experimental  and  analytical 
techniques  has  provided  various  kinds  of  information  on 
biological components (cell, tissue, disease, gene, protein, 
drug  response,  and  pathway,  etc.)  and  their  functions. 
Although information on individual biological components 
has  important  meaning,  biological  characteristics  result 
mainly from complex interactions among various biological 
components  [1-6].  So,  one  of  the  fundamental  aims  in 
biology  is  to  understand  complex  relationships  among 
heterogeneous  biological  data  that  contribute  to  the 
functions of a living cell. However, finding these interactions 
among heterogeneous biological data is very difficult due to 
the  complex  relationships  between  them.  For  example, 
many  disorders  are  caused  by  multiple  genetic  variants, 
which may affect pleiotropic genes, and are influenced by 

various environmental factors. 

To overcome this hurdle, various approaches have been 
developed  to  reveal  the  fundamental  mechanisms  that 
control  dynamic  cell  organization  by  analyzing  biological 
networks  [7-9].  However,  for  efficient  biological  network 
analyses,  traditional  relational  database  systems,  such  as 
MySQL  and  Oracle,  may  be  limited,  because  traditional 
relational databases store data in multiple tables and then 
infer  relationships  by  applying  multiple-join  statements. 
Although  biological  network  data  can  be  stored  in  a 
traditional relational database, join queries, which connect 
tables  linked  by  various  relationships,  become  too  com-
putationally  expensive  and  complex  to  design  as  more 
complex join operations are performed [10].

A graph database is a database that uses a graph structure. 
This  database  uses  nodes  (biological  entities)  and  edges 
(relationships)  to  represent  and  store  data.  Each  node 
represents an entity (such as a biological entity), and each

edge represents a connection or relationship between two 
nodes. The key concept of this system is a graph structure 
(organized by nodes and edges) for connections among the 
stored  data.  The  graph  database  is  more  expressive  and 
significantly  simpler  than  traditional  relational  databases 
and other NoSQL databases and is very useful for situations 
with heavily interconnected data [11]. Especially, the graph 
database is specialized to represent all of the relationships 
among large-scale data and is useful for managing deeply 
linked data. Nowadays, graph databases are widely used in 
many  fields,  including  computer  science  and  social  and 
technological network analyses. 

In  the  biological  community,  several  researchers  have 
begun to adopt the graph database for biological network 
analyses. For example, Lysenko et al. [10] showed that the 
graph database can effectively store and represent disease 
networks and is a suitable structure to establish for various 
hypotheses.  Henkel  et  al.  [12]  showed  that  the  graph 
database is a useful tool for effectively storing heterogeneous 
data  and  establishing  various  models.  Mullen  et  al.  [13] 
showed that the graph database can find novel usage (that is, 
drug  repositioning)  through  the  traversing  of  various 
relationships between a gene and disease. Balaur et al. [14] 
showed that the graph database is effective in investigating 
correlation between genetic and epigenetic factors in genetic 
and epigenetic data of colon cancer.

In this work, we set up a graph database and tested its 
performance  in  storing  and  retrieving  heterogeneous  and 
complex biological networks. We used Neo4j (http://neo4j. 
com/), one of the most frequently used graph databases, and 
compared  its  performance  with  MySQL  (https://www. 
mysql.com/) in diverse situations. We found that Neo4j is 
superior  to  MySQL  in  querying  complex  relationships 
among heterogeneous data. 

Methods
Selection of graph database engine

Among  the  many  graph  databases  available,  we  chose 
Neo4j, an open-source graph database based on Java, for our 
primary  graph  database,  owing  to  several  advantages.  Its 
major advantages include (1) the use of a graph model of 
relationships for intuitive information searches; (2) stability 
by  providing  full  ACID  (Access,  Create,  Insert,  Delete) 
transaction; (3) flexible extension above billions of nodes, 
relationships, and properties; (4) use of Java, which is easy to 
maintain  and  is  applicable  to  diverse  operating  systems 
(OSs); and (5) easy-to-use API based on the REST interface 
and Java API [15].

Hardware setup and optimization of the Neo4j 
graph DB

We set up a high-performance computer server (80 CPUs 
and 1 TB RAM) for the graph database to support the storage 
and analysis of billions of different biological networks and 
relationships. Also, we optimized the server by performance 
tuning of the installed Neo4j (Table 1) following the Neo4j 
operations manual [16]. The performance tuning included 
the following three steps (Fig. 1).

Memory configuration
The performance of Neo4j for a data search depends on 
the available memory to hold the entire graph database [17]. 
If  less  memory  is  used  than  what  the  constructed  graph 
database requires, a swap between the memory and hard 
disk should occur, but frequent swaps between memory and 
hard disk inevitably slow down the search speed. Thus, large 
memory is needed and should also be set up for Neo4j for full 
usage  of  the  system  memory.  The  memory  configuration 
includes three steps: (1) OS memory sizing, (2) page cache 
memory sizing, and (3) heap memory sizing.

Because  more  heap  memory  increases  the  performance 
greatly, we allocated 300 GB of memory to heap sizing. Thus, 
we set the dbms.memory.heap.initial_size parameter from 8 
GB to 300 GB and the dbms.memory.heap.max_size para-
meter from 8 GB to 300 GB.

Disk access configuration
Logical  transaction  logs  can  occur  in  system  and  data 
recovery after an  unexpected  system shutdown. They are 
also used for backup at online status. These transaction log 
files are renewed when their size exceeds a pre-defined size 
(default 25 MB). Because these processes also affect system 
performance, we optimized the parameters. The open file 
limit  of  most  LINUX  servers  is  1,024.  However,  because 
Neo4j  stores  data  as  numerous  index  files,  it  frequently 
accesses many files. Thus, we changed the open file limit to 
400,000.

Hardware setup and optimization of the MySQL DB

We optimized the server through performance tuning of 
the  installed  MySQL  following  the  MySQL  operations 
manual. The performance tuning included the following two 
steps: (1) storage engine and (2) parameters of the MySQL 
environment.

Storage engine
MySQL has a variety of storage engines, each with its own 
characteristics. We chose InnoDB among them. MyISAM, a 
simple and fast feature, was a strong candidate, but MyISAM 
does not guarantee data integrity. In addition, table locking 
occurs  frequently  when  more  than  5  million  data  are 
processed  in  the  indexed  state,  thereby  deteriorating  the 
retrieval performance. Although InnoDB is slightly slower 
than  MyISAM,  InnoDB  guarantees  data  integrity  by 
supporting transactions. InnoDB loads indexes and data into 
memory for retrieval processing, so allocating more memory 
improves performance. 

Parameters of MySQL server
Optimization of Disk I/O
Disk  searching  is  a  huge  performance  bottleneck.  This 
problem becomes more apparent when the amount of data 
becomes too large to effectively cache it. To overcome this 
problem,  use  disks  with  low  seek  times.  Table  data  are 
cached in  the InnoDB buffer pool,  and we  optimized the 
innodb_buffer_pool_size parameter from default to 800 Gb 
(50% to 75% of system memory). To optimize the maximum 
size  of  internal  in-memory  temporary  tables,  we  set  the 
tmp_table_size and max_heap_ table_size parameter from 
default to 64 Gb. To avoid degradation in the performance of 
InnoDB, use direct I/O for InnoDB-related files (innodb_

graph  database.  Bottom  layer:  file  open  limit  optimization;  Neo4j 
often produces many small and random reads when querying data.
Middle layer: page cache sizing; if all, or at least most, of the graph 
data files from a hard disk are cached into memory, it will reduce
disk  access  and  result  in  optimal  performance.  Top  layer:  heap 
sizing; it is beneficial to set a large heap space to support various
query operations. OS, operating system; JVM, Java Virtual Machine.

OS memory sizing
The OS memory size is as follows:
OS memory = 1 GB + (Size of graph.db/index) + (Size of 

graph.db/schema).

Thus,  we  allocated  768  GB  of  memory  to  page  cache 
memory and heap memory according to the DB file size. 
According to the Neo4j document:
Actual OS allocation = Available RAM − (Page cache + 
Heap size).

We allocated 100 GB for system memory and the rest to 

page cache and heap size.

Page cache sizing
Page cache is used when accessing Neo4j data stored on a 
hard disk. When the size of the entire data is larger than the 
page cache memory, a swap occurs, frequently resulting in 
high  disk  access  cost  and  reduced  performance.  A  basic 
option is to allocate 4 GB of memory based on the size of the 
graph DB data directory size (NEO4J_HOME/data/graph. 
db/neostore.\*.db). However, as our current data are larger 
than  10  GB,  we  resized  the  dbms.memory.pagecache.size 
parameter to above 200 GB.

Heap sizing
Based  on  Java,  Neo4j  can  use  more  memory  as  heap 
memory  in  a  Java  Virtual  Machine  (JVM)  is  increased.

flush_method = O_DIRECT). To optimize the log file I/O, 
we set the innodb_log_file_size parameter from default to 
120 Gb (15% of innodb_b uffer_pool_size).

Optimization of memory use
MySQL  allocates  buffers  and  cache  to  improve  the 
performance of database operations. The default setting is 
designed to start the MySQL server on a virtual machine with 
approximately  512  MB  of  RAM.  So,  we  improved  the 
performance of MySQL by optimizing the values of certain 
cache- and buffer-related system variables. To optimize the 
size  of  the  buffer  used  for  index  blocks,  we  set  the 
key_buffer_size parameter from default to 250 Gb (25% of 
system  memory). The  table_open_cache parameter is  the 
number of open tables for all threads. We set this parameter 
from  default  to  524,288  (maximum  allowed  value).  The 
join_buffer_size and sort_buffer_size parameters were set 
from  default  to  4  Gb.  The  read_buffer_size,  max_heap_ 
table_size,  and  thread  cache  parameters  were  set  from 
default to the maximum allowed value.

the web and classified them into five layers (Tables 2 and 3). 

Data processing and modeling

After  data  collection,  we  first  classified  each  data  into

(Fig. 2). Then, we integrated and expanded all nodes and 
relationships (Fig. 3). Next, we created data models for each 
type of node and relationship (Figs. 4 and 5).

Results
Comparison of Neo4j after optimization

We  tested  how  the  optimization  of  the  Neo4j  system 
improved  its  performance.  We  compared  two  servers: 
optimized versus non-optimized servers. The non-optimized 
servers had default settings for OS memory and environment. 
The optimized server had several modified settings in (1) 
page cache sizing, (2) OS memory, (3) heap memory of the 
JVM, and (4) the number of open file limits.

We performed the same query on each server to compare 
the  query  performance  of  non-optimized  and  optimized 
servers. We measured the time to return results by perform-

expression  of  the  BRCA1  gene  (Supplementary  Fig.  1). 
When the two servers were queried using the same search 
term, the optimized server returned results in 138 ms, while 
the non-optimized server returned results in 316 ms for the 
same query (Fig. 6).

Comparison of search speed between two databases

Traditionally,  most  biological  data  have  been  stored  in 
relational  database  systems.  While  relational  database 
systems are useful for hierarchical and structural storage and 
search of various data, they may be less well suited for the 
storage and search of data with heavy relationships. While 
relational database systems can use multiple ‘joins’ to infer 
relationships  among  different  tables,  multiple-join  opera-
tions lead to significant execution times for a query. When 
we  compared  MySQL,  one  of  the  most  famous  relational 
database systems, with Neo4j for the same kinds of data, we 
found that Neo4j outperformed MySQL in all tested cases. 
We performed a query in MySQL and Neo4j to retrieve all 
data belonging to a particular gene-related path in a gene, 
disease, and drug relationship through a 3-layer search. For

disease.  The  search  for  4  layers  is  a  search  for  gene-protein-drug- 
pathway  associated  with  a  particular  protein.

the relationship between proteins that are homologous to a 
particular  protein  in  a  gene,  protein,  drug,  and  pathway 
relationship and the various nodes that traverse that protein

and Neo4j) were queried using the same search term, Neo4j 
took 2.128 s, while MySQL took 58.325 sec for a 3-layer 
search. For the 4-layer search, Neo4j took 20.128 s, while 
MySQL was unable to return a result (Fig. 7).

Examples of graph database usage

The graph database provides a flexible search for complex 
relationships, as well as a fast search for relationships among 
multiple nodes. We show here two examples of using a graph 
database. The first is a search for the shortest paths travers-
ing  various  relationships  among  connected  nodes.  For 

example,  exploring  the  relationship  between  biological 
entities that are involved in two biological mechanisms can 
identify  new  potential  targets  for  disease  treatment  and 
provide better insights into drug administration. The first 
example is a graph that identifies the shortest path among 
protein interactions or homologous proteins within three 
levels  of  the  protein  subsets  associated  with  a  nuclear

receptor  (Fig.  8A).  It  can  be  seen  that  the  two  distinct 
subsets of proteins belong to a common pathway.

The  second  example  includes  flexible  extensions  and 
searches of the constructed graph database. When adding a 
new  relationship  in  the  constructed  graph  database,  it  is 
possible to flexibly define and add the relationship, regard-
less of the structure of the existing graph database. Fig. 8B 
shows an example of adding a result of a new genetic analysis 
to the existing graph database and using it for a search. The 
added information can be easily defined and added without 
restrictions from the existing graph database structure. In 
this  example,  the  added  information  is  a  node,  named 
‘classifier,’ which is related to the existing graph database. In 
contrast, the relational database system is quite inflexible in 
adding  new  types  of  information,  because  it  sometimes 
requires the redesign of existing tables.

Discussion

Most biological databases have used relational database 
systems  for  data  storage,  retrieval,  and  searches.  The 
relational database system is a useful system for the storage 
of well-structured data with pre-defined columns. However, 
even though it is termed relational, the relational database 
system does not store relationships among heterogeneous 
data  by themselves.  Rather, it  infers  relationships  among 
different data during a query by using the ‘join’ operation. 
Thus, paradoxically, the relational database system itself is 
not relational and is inefficient in the storage and retrieval of 
diverse  relationships  among  data.  As  more  and  more 
biological data accumulate, it is becoming evident that the 
relational database system is limited in dealing with multi-
tudes of complex networks and relationships among various 
kinds of biological data. 

To overcome the current limits of the relational database 
system  in  dealing  with  complex  biological  networks  and 
relationships, we employed and tested the graph database 
system, one of the NoSQL databases that are actively being 
developed to deal with various kinds of large data. We used 
Neo4j,  one  of  the  most  actively  developed,  open-source 
graph  databases  with  property  graph  models.  We  first 
optimized various parameters of a graph database server for 
maximum  performance,  as  suggested  by  the  Neo4j  com-
munity,  and  achieved  more  than  40%  improvement  in 
performance. During the optimization, we found that Neo4j 
creates many index files for the storage of many relationships 
and depends heavily on system memory to read and write 
those index files. Thus, as the size of data increases and as 
more complex queries are executed, the performance of a 
graph database depends more on memory than the CPU. 
Thus, to achieve better performance from a given hardware 

system, the system memory should first be optimized.

When  we  compared  the  performance  of  Neo4j  with 
MySQL  for  several  queries  on  diverse  relationships,  we 
found that Neo4j always outperformed MySQL in terms of 
execution time−the more complex the relationships that 
were queried, the larger the difference in time between the 
two systems. For very complex relationships−for example, 
tens of millions of relationships or relationships with more 
than five steps (or five join operations)−MySQL was unable 
to finish the query. In this regard, we found that for the study 
of complex relationships among heterogeneous biological 
data,  the  graph  database  is  more  promising  than  the 
relational database system. 

In real life, various kinds of graph databases have changed 
our  lives  in  many  ways.  Facebook,  LinkedIn,  and  online 
airplane booking service companies are examples of com-
panies that utilize graph databases extensively. In the field of 
biological  research,  the  graph  database  also  has  enough 
potential  to  find  various  unknown  novel  relationships 
among various heterogeneous biological data.
