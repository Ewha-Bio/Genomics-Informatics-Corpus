Medication  adherence  is  generally  defined  as  the  extent  of  voluntary  cooperation  of  a  patient  in  taking  medicine  as 
prescribed.  Adherence  to  long-term  treatment  with  chronic  disease  is  essential  for  reducing  disease  comorbidity  and 
mortality. However, medication non-adherence in chronic disease averages 50%. This study was conducted a genome-wide 
association study to identify the genetic basis of medication adherence. A total of 235 medication non-adherents and 1,067 
medication adherents with hypertension or diabetes were used from the Korean Association Resource project data according 
to the self-reported treatment status of each chronic disease, respectively. We identified four single nucleotide polymor-
phisms with suggestive  genome-wide association.  The  most  significant single nucleotide polymorphism  was  rs6978712 
−7),  which  is  located  proximal  to  the  GCC1  gene,  which  was  previously  implicated  in

decision-making  capability  in  drug  abusers.  Two  suggestive  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  were  in  strong  linkage 
disequilibrium (r2 ＞ 0.8) with rs6978712. Thus, in the aspect of decision-making in adherence behavior, the association 

between medication adherence and three loci proximal to the GCC1 gene seems worthy of further research. However, to 
overcome a few limitations in this study, defining the standardized phenotype criteria for self-reported adherence should be 
performed before replicating association studies.

Introduction

Medication adherence is generally defined as the extent to 
which patient take medications to coincide with the health-
care provider's recommendation [1]. Adherence to long-term 
treatment in chronic disease, such as hypertension and dia-
betes,  is  essential  for  reducing  the  risks  of  disease  co-
morbidity and mortality [2]. Poor adherence to medication 
can cause worsening of disease, death, and increased finan-
cial burden for society [1]. Most cases of hypertension and 
diabetes are inextirpable.  The main goal of treatment for 
these chronic diseases is to delay disease progression and to 
prevent developing complications. Thus, medication adher-
ence is one of the most important factors for success in life-
long treatment [3]. However, medication non-adherence in 
chronic disease averages 50% [4]. The World Health Organi-

zation reported that non-adherence is a leading cause of pre-
ventable death and cost. Predictors of poor adherence are a 
useful indicator for physicians to identify patients who are 
most  in  need  of  interventions  to  improve  adherence  [1]. 
Illness perceptions and self-efficacy are powerful predictors 
of adherence [2]. These health-related cognitions have asso-
ciations with personality, and personality traits can be con-
veniently summarized by a five-factor model of personality 
(conscientiousness,  neuroticism,  agreeableness,  extraver-
sion, and openness) [5]. Several studies have explored the 
associations between personality and adherence. Among the 
12  previous  publications  exploring  associations  between 
personality traits and medication adherence, 7 studies re-
ported that medication adherence has been positively related 
to conscientiousness, 5 studies reported negative relation-
ships  with  neuroticism,  2  studies  reported  about  agree-
ableness with positive associations, and 1 study reported a

positive relationship with extraversion [6-8]. A genetic basis 
of personality traits has been identified from behavior genet-
ic studies. Twin, adoption, and family studies show that her-
itability of personality is about 50% [9]. Several studies have 
attempted to identify candidate genes with five dimensions 
of  personality,  but  the  results  were  inconclusive.  Genetic 
linkage studies have suggested only a few genomic regions 
for personality traits. The genetic influences on personality 
traits are likely attributable to many genes with small effects. 
Few genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identi-
fied  genetic  variants  associated  with  personality  traits. 
However, most of the associations with personality traits 
could not be replicated, except in one study [8]. Unlike the 
attempts to elucidate the genomic associations of person-
ality, there is no research on the genetic aspect of medication 
adherence until now. We assumed that medication adher-
ence has a genetic background, as the personality traits that 
affect medication adherence have a genetic basis for herita-
bility. Therefore, we conducted a GWAS to identify the asso-
ciation between medication adherence and genotype.

Methods
Study subjects

A nested case-control study of medication adherence in 
chronic diseases (hypertension or diabetes) was conducted 
within the Korean Association Resource (KARE) project da-
ta (which included genotypes from 8,842 participants from 
the rural Anseong and urban Ansan cohorts as part of the 
Korean  Genome  Epidemiology  Study)  [10].  Two  groups 
were  extracted  from  the  KARE  data,  one  of  medication 
non-adherents with chronic disease (cases) and the other of 
medication adherents with chronic disease (controls), based 
on the following procedure (Fig. 1). There were 1,387 and 
613 individuals who were diagnosed with hypertension and 
diabetes, respectively, of a total of 8,842; 1,540 individuals 
were defined as patients with chronic disease after excluding 
230  patients  with  comorbid  hypertension  and  diabetes. 
Among 1,540 patients with chronic disease, a patient who 
was undergoing treatment for hypertension or diabetes or 
who was taking hypertensive or diabetes medicines (inclu-
ding  insulin)  were  classified  as  the  control  group  (n  = 
1,072). Patients who was not receiving treatment or taking 
medicines were classified as the case group (n = 239). Indi-
viduals  whose  information  about  treatment  was  not  pro-
vided were removed (n = 229). Consequently, 235 cases and 
1,067 controls were used for the GWAS after excluding 9 pa-
tients with comorbid psychotic disorders or cognitive dis-
orders, such as dementia [1].

Genotyping 

The  genotyping  and  quality  control  procedures  for  the 
KARE data have been described previously [10]. Single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a high missing gene 
call rate (＞5%), low minor allele frequency (＜0.05), and 
significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p 
≤ 0.001) were excluded, leaving a total of 311,493 SNPs to 
be examined.

Statistical analyses

The case-control GWAS was conducted using PLINK soft-
ware version 1.07 [11]. A quantile-quantile (QQ) plot and a 
Manhattan plot were produced using the R statistics package 
[12]. A regional plot was generated using LocusZoom 1.1 
[13]. Student’s t-test and Fisher’s exact test were used to 
test differences in basic and clinical characteristics between

Results
Characteristics of study subjects

The general and clinical characteristics of the case and 
control  groups  are  described  in  Table  1.  The  case  group 
(non-adherents) consisted of 80 subjects with diabetes and 
155 individuals with hypertension, and the control group 
(adherents) consisted of 240 and 827, respectively. Individu-
als with diabetes tended to adhere less to medication than 
hypertensive patients [14]. The mean age of the case group 
was 54.29 ± 8.10 and 57.66 ± 7.90 years in the control 

group. Adherents were significantly older than non-adhe-
rents. Males were  less adherent  than females. All results 
above are consistent with previous studies of factors affect-
ing medication adherence [3]. Among the clinical character-
istics, diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive individuals 
was higher in the non-adherence group. However, systolic 
blood pressure in hypertensive patients and fasting plasma 
glucose in diabetic person were similar between adherence 
and non-adherence groups. The rates of family history of hy-
pertension,  diabetes,  and  their  life-threatening  complica-
tions, such as cerebrovascular attack and coronary artery dis-
ease, did not differ between case and control groups.

SNPs associated with medication adherence

The GWAS for medication adherence in 1,067 medication 
adherents and 235 medication non-adherents showed multi-
ple SNPs with a suggestive association (Fig. 2). The QQ plot 
showed that most of the observed associations lay close to 
the expected distribution, conforming to the null hypothesis 
of no association. The genomic inflation factor was 1.00, in-
dicating no evidence of inflation in the test statistics due to 
population stratification or other sources. SNPs with a sug-

gestive genome-wide association (p ＜ 1 × 10

nificance (p ＜ 5 × 10
rs7690819, rs11973012) with suggestive significance were 
identified. The most significant SNP was rs6978712 (p = 
−7), which is located proximal to the GCC1 gene, 
4.87 × 10
which was previously implicated in decision-making capa-

bility in drug abusers [15]. Three SNPs on chromosome 7 
were in close proximity, and Fig. 3 shows a regional associa-
tion for these SNPs proximal to the GCC1 gene. 

Discussion

Medication adherence averages only 50% among patients 
receiving treatment for chronic diseases. Poor medication 
adherence contributes to worsening disease, death, and in-
creased health care costs. Moreover, if medication adherence 
is not guaranteed, new therapeutic options, such as person-
alized  medicine  that  aims  to  customize  healthcare  to  in-
dividual  patients  based  on  their  genetic  background,  are 
merely useless [16]. However, in spite of its importance in 
personal and social aspects, the genetic background for med-
ication adherence has never been studied. Since personality 
traits that have a genetic background affect behaviors, in-

124

cluding medication non-adherence, this study aimed to ex-
plore the genetic basis of medication adherence in chronic 
diseases for the first time.

Among  the  hypertensive  or  diabetic  patients  from  the 
KARE  cohort  study,  235  medication  non-adherent  in-
dividuals (case) and 1,067 medication adherent individuals 
(control) were extracted according to the self-reported treat-
ment status for the disease from the cohort questionnaire. 
Patient  self-reports  are  considered  a  simple  and  effective 
method to measure adherence, since a gold standard does 
not exist [1]. Patients with cognitive impairments that can 
affect adherence were excluded. Defining rigorous pheno-
type criteria is paramount to the success of a case-control 
GWAS [17]. Thus, the method of classifying individuals as 
either case or control in this study was validated by compar-
ing the general characteristics of the case-control subjects. 
The differences in demographic factors (age and gender) and 
disease factors for adherence between the two groups were 
consistent with previous reports (Table 1) [3]. 

Nevertheless, the classification criteria in this study have 
limitations. First, there is the possibility of misclassification 
of treatment-adherent individuals as medication non-adher-
ent patients, because the criteria were based exclusively on 
current medication status for hypertension or diabetes. For 
example, patients with mild hypertension or diabetes who 
follow instructions from the physician to modify their diet or 
lifestyle as an initial therapy can be classified as medication 
non-adherent individuals. Second, the different ratio of the 
number of hypertensive and diabetic patients between the 
case and control groups can affect the GWAS results [18]. 
Additionally, the risk of volunteer bias is present, in which 
individuals who participated in the KARE cohort possibly 
tended to adhere more to health care services. To overcome 
these limitations, standardized phenotype criteria for self-re-
ported adherence, such as the five-item Medication Adher-
ence Report Scale-MARS-5, which has already been used in 
various settings [19], and the eight-item Morisky Medica-
tion Adherence Scale-MMAS-8, which has been validated in 
over 1,000 individuals with hypertension [20], can be ap-
plied in the study design. These criteria enable reliable and 
replicable classification of medication adherence [17]. 

This study identified four loci that were suggestively asso-
ciated with medication adherence. The most significantly as-
−7), which is lo-
sociated SNP was rs6978712 (p = 4.87 × 10
cated nearby the GCC1 gene on chromosome 7. Two sugges-
tive SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8) 
with rs6978712 (Fig. 3). This might be due to the close phys-
ical proximity of those three SNPs. GCC1 encodes a periph-
eral membrane protein that may have a role in the organ-
ization of the trans-Golgi network subcompartment that is 
associated with membrane transport [21]. The trans-Golgi 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

network is a major secretory pathway that sorts and directs 
newly synthesized proteins to subcellular destinations, in-
cluding neuronal synapses. Increased transcription of GCC1 
in the brain cortex of drug abusers has been reported in one 
study [15]. This study indicates that GCC1 is involved in de-
cision-making  capabilities  in  drug  abusers.  Patients  with 
chronic  diseases  weigh  the  benefits  from  adherence  with 
treatment against the constraints on their daily lives and the 
perceived risks of treatment, such as side effects, time, mon-
ey, and effort involved, either consciously or subconsciously 
[3]. Thus, in the aspect of decision-making in adherence be-
havior, the association between medication adherence and 
the three SNPs proximal to the GCC1 gene identified in this 
study  seems  worthy  of  further  research.  The  personality 
trait-associated SNPs were not associated with medication 
adherence in this study. Because of the multivariate associa-
tion between personality traits and medication adherence, it 
seems difficult to apply the personality trait-associated SNPs 
to the medication adherence-associated SNPs directly.

This study suggests potential evidence for a genetic basis 
of medication adherence in chronic disease patients. A com-
plete identification of the genetic influences for medication 
adherence appears feasible, because medication adherence is 
complexly influenced by not only personality traits but also 
many  factors,  including  socio-economic  factors,  health-
care-related factors, and demographic factors [3]. Neverthe-
less, identifying genetic associations for poor medication ad-
herence in chronic disease patients requires further research. 
It would be helpful for physicians to initiate personalized 
medication therapy by modifying treatment strategies, such 
as changing the route of administration, the complexity of 
treatment, and the degree of behavioral change required, for 
chronic disease patients with expected poor medication ad-
herence from their genetic background.
