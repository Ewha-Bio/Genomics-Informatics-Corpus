The success of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) has enabled us to improve risk assessment and provide novel 
genetic variants for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. However, most variants discovered by GWASs have been reported 
to have very small effect sizes on complex human diseases, which has been a big hurdle in building risk prediction models. 
Recently, many statistical approaches based on penalized regression have been developed to solve the “large p and small n” 
problem. In this report, we evaluated the performance of several statistical methods for predicting a binary trait: stepwise 
logistic  regression  (SLR),  least  absolute  shrinkage  and  selection  operator  (LASSO),  and  Elastic-Net  (EN).  We  first  built  a 
prediction model by combining variable selection and prediction methods for type 2 diabetes using Affymetrix Genome-Wide 
Human SNP Array 5.0 from the Korean Association Resource project. We assessed the risk prediction performance using area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the  internal and external  validation datasets.  In  the internal 
validation, SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN tended to yield more accurate predictions than other combinations. During the external 
validation, the SLR-SLR and SLR-EN combinations achieved the highest AUC of 0.726. We propose these combinations as a 
potentially powerful risk prediction model for type 2 diabetes.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have success-
fully  identified  susceptibility  variants  associated  with 
human diseases. However, most susceptibility variants have 
small  effect  sizes  and  explain  only  a  small  proportion  of 
heritability [1]. The presence of a large number of variants 
genotyped for a small number of subjects (commonly known 
as  “large  p  small  n”)  has  been  one  major  challenge  in 
building disease risk prediction models. Furthermore, the 
issue of multicollinearity arises when there is high linkage 
disequilibrium (LD) among single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs). Multiple regression is very unstable and sensitive 
due to multicollinearity, in which the coefficient estimates 
have very large variances [2]. Recently, various statistical 
approaches have been proposed to cope with these issues.

Traditional  approaches  for  disease  risk  prediction  have 
been based on gene scores (GSs) [3-6]. The marginal effects 

of previously known disease-associated loci are estimated, 
and then, their sum can be used to construct a risk prediction 
model. While GS-based approaches can be useful when a 
genetic variant is responsible for diseases [7], they show low 
prediction performance when multiple genetic variants exist 
for a complex disease [8, 9]. For example, the prediction 
performance for coronary heart and disease type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) is only 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, for area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values [8, 9].
For  complex  diseases,  a  more  accurate  and  reliable 
prediction  model  is  required.  Multiple  logistic  regression 
(MLR)  is  a  classification  method  that  utilizes  combined 
information across multiple genetic variants. Several studies 
have  shown  that  the  MLR-based  approach  is  useful  in 
building a disease risk prediction model [10-13]. However, if 
there is large LD between SNPs, the parameter estimates of 
MLR become unstable, and as a result, the risk prediction 
model has weak predictive power.

As an alternative to MLR, data mining approaches have

been used widely to improve risk prediction performance. In 
particular,  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  [14,  15]  and 
random forest [16, 17] have been shown to outperform other 
classification algorithms [18]. Although these data mining 
approaches may provide very useful tools in classification, 
the  effects  of  genetic  variants  on  a  disease  in  prediction 
models are not easy to interpret. Furthermore, these approa-
ches do not give class conditional probabilities of individual 
predictions  [19].  Thus,  we  focus  mainly  on  penalized 
regression  approaches  in  this  paper,  which  provides  an 
individual prediction result in terms of probability. 

As mentioned before, the problem of “large p small n” 
interrupts  the  estimation  of  the  joint  effect  of  multiple 
genetic variants. In order to overcome this, various penalized 
regression approaches have been proposed, such as ridge 
[20-22],  least  absolute  shrinkage  and  selection  operator 
(LASSO) [23], and Elastic-Net (EN) [24]. These penalized 
approaches  have  an  advantage  in  terms  of  both  variable 
selection and prediction power over non-penalized approa-
ches for high-dimensional data. For instance, the prediction 
performance  for  Crohn  disease  and  inflammatory  bowel 
disease using a number of genetic variants with penalized 
approaches has been shown to improve [25, 26].

In this study, we investigated the effect of variable selec-
tion on the performance of prediction methods. Especially, 
we considered the following methods for variable selection 
and prediction: stepwise logistic regression (SLR), LASSO, 
and EN. We compared the effect of variable selection on the 
performance of prediction by applying them to T2D GWAS 
chip  data.  We  constructed  the  prediction  models  by 
combining variable selection and prediction methods using 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

the  Korean  Association  Resource  (KARE)  GWAS  dataset 
(3,180 individuals) and then evaluated the performance of 
the risk prediction model through both internal validation 
(805 individuals in the KARE testing dataset) and external 
validation  (4,723  individuals  in  an  external  replication 
dataset).  The  external  replication  dataset  combined  two 
cohorts: the Health2 study (1,816 individuals) and Health 
Examinee (HEXA) study (3,696 individuals). In both the 
internal and external validation datasets, we measured the 
discriminative accuracy of the prediction models using AUC.

Methods
KARE dataset

The KARE project was initiated in 2007 to undertake a 
large-scale  GWAS  with  10,038  participants  from  two 
community-based cohorts (i.e., the rural Anseong and urban 
Ansan  cohorts).  Among  the  participants,  10,004  samples 
were  genotyped  using  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human 
SNP  Array  5.0  Affymetrix,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  From 
sample and SNP quality controls, a total of 8,842 individuals 
were  selected  from  the  Anseong  (2,374  men  and  2,263 
women) and Ansan (1,809 men and 2,396 women) cohorts 
[27].  Missing  genotypes  were  imputed  using  the  Beale 
software program [28]. 

In this study, a total of 3,985 samples were selected from 
among the 8,842 individuals using T2D diagnostic criteria 
[29, 30]. A total of 1,042 subjects were included in the T2D 
group according to the following criteria: (1) fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG) larger than or equal to 126 mg/dL, 2-hour 
postprandial blood glucose (Glu120) larger than or equal to

200 mg/dL, (2) treatment of T2D, and (3) age of disease 
onset  ≥ 40  years.  The  inclusion  criteria  for  nondiabetic 
normal subjects (n = 2,943) were as follows: (1) FPG less 
than or equal to 100 mg/dL or Glu120 less than or equal to 
140 mg/dL and (2) no history of diabetes. The demographic 
variables of the subjects are summarized in Table 1.

Health2 and HEXA datasets

We combined two Korean GWASs, the Health2 study (n = 
1,816) and the HEXA study (n = 3,696). The Health2 study 
consists of community-based cohorts from 5 rural areas (i.e., 
Wonju, Pyeongchang, Gangneung, Geumsan, and Naju), and 
the  HEXA  study  is  a  cohort  from  14  urban  areas.  These 
samples  were  genotyped  using  the  Affymetrix  Genome- 
Wide Human SNP array 6.0. The Health2 and the HEXA 
cohorts have been described in previous studies [27, 31, 32]. 
Missing genotypes were were imputed using Beagle software.
Our investigation was based on the analysis of an external 
replication dataset of 4,723 samples (1,112 T2D subjects, 
3,611 normal subjects) for T2D [33]. The criteria for grou-
ping  T2D  subjects  (nHealth2  =  794,  nHEXA  =  318)  and 
nondiabetic normal subjects (nHealth2 = 770, nHEXA = 2,841) 
were FPG level (FPG ≥ 126 for T2D subjects and FPG ≤ 100 
for  nondiabetic  normal  subjects)  and  history  of  T2D 
treatment. The demographic variables of the subjects in the 
Health2 and HEXA cohorts are summarized in Table 1.

Statistical analysis

For the joint identification of disease susceptibility variants 
among a large number of SNPs, we extracted SNPs having a 
strong  correlation  with  T2D  via  logistic  regression  for 
single-variant analysis and collected the list of reported SNPs 
from a GWAS catalog [34]. Then, we implemented a 3-stage 
procedure as follows: the first stage was variable selection 

using  SLR,  LASSO,  and  EN.  The  second  stage  was  the 
construction of risk prediction models. The third stage was 
evaluation  of  the  risk  prediction  models  through  both 
internal validation and external validation.

SNP sets

Because the components of SNPs seem to be related to the 
performance of risk prediction, we used two data sources 
(i.e., the GWAS catalog and KARE cohort). First, we collec-
ted the SNPs, p1, from a GWAS catalog in all populations and 
an Asian population only. Second, the SNPs were selected by 
single-variant association test using logistic regression, with 
adjustments for age, sex, area (namely, rural area of Anseong 
and urban area of Ansan), and body mass index (BMI). We 
chose the top-ranked p2 SNPs by the order of p-values from 
the KARE cohort. In Table 2, we have categorized five SNP 
sets.

(1) ALL (SNPs only reported in the GWAS catalog)
(2) ASIAN (SNPs only reported in the GWAS catalog with 

an Asian population)

(3) KARE (only top-ranked p2 SNPs in the KARE cohort)
(4) ALL ＋ KARE (combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog 

and KARE cohort)

(5) ASIAN + KARE (combined SNPs in the GWAS catalog 

with an Asian population and the KARE cohort)

Stage 1: Variable selection
In  the  KARE  dataset,  we  separated  3,985  individuals 
(1,042 T2D subjects, 2,943 normal subjects) into a training 
set of 3,180 individuals (830 T2D subjects, 2,350 normal 
subjects) and a test set of 805 individuals (212 T2D subjects, 
593 normal subjects) (see Fig. 1). The variable selection was 
performed using 5-fold cross-validation (CV) on the training 
set. We describe the details below.

where Xi = (xi1, ..., xij, ..., xip)T and COVi = (AGEi, SEXi, AREAi, 
BMIi)T for the i-th subject, β = (β1, ..., βj, ..., βp)T, and γ = 
(γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4)T. Lasso and EN penalties are defined as 
Pλ(β) = λΣ|β| and Pλ(β) = λ[(1 − α)Σ|β| ＋ αΣβ2], 
respectively. λ and α are a tuning parameter and a weight of 
a value between 0 to 1, respectively. All penalized methods 
were conducted using the R-package glmnet [37].

Then, we defined five sets as follows:
(1) One set: set of SNPs that have a non-zero coefficient at 

least one time among the 5-fold CV

(2) Two set: set of SNPs that have a non-zero coefficient at 

least two times among the 5-fold CV

(3) Three set: set of SNPs that have a non-zero coefficient 

at least three times among the 5-fold CV

(4) Four set: set of SNPs that have a non-zero coefficient 

at least four times among the 5-fold CV

(5) Five set: set of SNPs having non-zero coefficients in 

the 5-fold CV,

where one set ⊃ two set ⊃ three set ⊃ four set ⊃ five set.

Stage 2: Construction of risk prediction models 
For  construction  of  the  risk  prediction  model,  we 
considered  9  combinations  of  variable  selection  and  pre-
diction methods (i.e., SLR-SLR, SLR-LASSO, SLR-EN, LASSO- 
SLR, LASSO-LASSO, LASSO-EN, EN-SLR, EN- LASSO, and 
EN-EN). For each combination, we constructed prediction 
models using the entire KARE training dataset (n = 3,180).

Stage 3: Evaluation of risk prediction models
For evaluating the risk prediction performance, we needed 
to  assess  both  internally  and  externally  to  determine  the 
performance of the prediction models. To validate the risk 
prediction methods, we used internal and external validation 
datasets from the KARE testing dataset (n = 805) and an 
external replication dataset (n = 4,723), respectively. In both 
the internal and external validation datasets, we used the 
AUC of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, 
which is widely used for risk prediction performance [38, 
39]. The ROC curve is a graphical plot of sensitivity (true 
positive  rate)  against  1 –  specificity  (false-positive  rate) 
across all possible threshold values. A summary measure of 
ROC curves, such as AUC, is indicated as the discriminative 
accuracy. An AUC score close to 0.5 reflects random chance, 
while AUC values closer to 1 indicate perfect accuracy.

ASIAN  datasets,  whereas  the  results  showed  differences 
among the methods in the KARE and ALL ＋ KARE datasets. 
Furthermore,  SLR  generally  tended  to  select  a  smaller 
number of SNPs than LASSO and EN.

Construction of prediction models and validation in 
testing datasets

We fitted the prediction models using SLR, LASSO, and 
EN using the entire training individuals in the KARE cohort. 
Then, we applied the prediction models to the KARE testing 
dataset and an external replication dataset. The prediction 
models were built based on Affymetrix 5.0, but the external 
replication dataset was generated by Affymetrix 6.0. In the 
case of the KARE dataset, nearly 90% of the SNPs belonged 
to the external replication dataset. Thus, we did not include 
untyped SNPs in the evaluation of prediction models using 
the  replication  dataset.  Among  the  five  SNP  sets,  Fig.  3 
shows that the prediction models from the KARE SNP set 
had higher AUC values for the KARE testing dataset than 
other SNP sets. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4, the prediction 

models from ALL ＋ KARE had the best performance overall 
for  the  external  replication  dataset.  In  Table  4,  the  best 
combinations of the variable selection and prediction models 
had the highest AUC values. SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN with 
three set from KARE had an AUC of 0.816 in the KARE 
testing dataset. In an external replication dataset, SLR-SLR 
and SLR-EN with one set from ALL ＋ KARE (AUC, 0.726) 
were the best, with 51 SNPs for T2D, while SLR-LASSO and 
SLR-EN with three set from KARE (AUC, 0.590) showed the 
best performance, with 53 SNPs. SLR-SLR with one set from 
ALL ＋ KARE was superior to the model with only demo-
graphic variables (15.7% increase in AUC). Among the 51 
SNPs of SLR-SLR with one set from ALL ＋ KARE, 38 SNPs 
were mapped to the genes (Table 5). Some genes (AGR3, 
C2CD4B,  C6orf57,  CAMK1D,  DNER,  IGF2BP2,  KCNJ11, 
KCNQ1, NXN, PLS1, and RGS7) were previously reported to 
be associated with T2D [44-53].

S  Choi, et al.  Risk  Prediction  Models  Using  GWAS  for  T2D

Discussion

In  this  study,  we  compared  the  performance  of  risk 
prediction models combining variable selection and prediction 
methods. Also, the effect of five SNP sets (i.e., ALL, ASIAN, 
KARE,  ALL  ＋ KARE,  and  ASIAN  ＋ KARE)  on  risk 
prediction performance was investigated. Overall, we con-
firmed  that  prediction  models  incorporating  both  demo-
graphic variables and genetic variables were more accurate 
than prediction models using only demographic variables. 
According  to  our  results,  the  best  combinations  were 
SLR-LASSO and SLR-EN with three set from the KARE SNP 
set in the KARE testing dataset, whereas the SLR-SLR and 
SLR-EN combination with one set from the ALL ＋ KARE 
SNP set outperformed all other combinations in an external 
replication dataset.

The analysis of risk prediction studies can be extended in 
several  ways.  First,  the  performance  of  a  risk  prediction 
model  can  be  improved  by  incorporating  rare  variants. 
Advances  in  sequencing  technology  make  it  possible  to 
investigate  the  role  of  common  and  rare  variants  in  risk 
prediction of complex diseases. Wei and Lu [54] proposed a 
collapsing  ROC  approach  that 
incorporates  genetic 
information  from  both  common  and  rare  variants.  A 
prediction algorithm based on SVM with common and rare 
variants  was  proposed  in  order  to  improve  predictive 
performance [55]. Second, integrating biological knowledge 
into  a  risk  prediction  model  will  provide  more  accurate 
predictions  and  biologically  meaningful  interpretation. 
Eleftherohorinou  et  al.  [56]  have  shown  success  of  a 
pathway-based  prediction  test  of  GWAS  data.  Recently,  a 
pathway-based  approach  was  proposed  to  incorporate 
principal  components  of  pathway  effects  and  pathway- 
covariate interactions into logistic regression [57]. Further-
more,  a  risk  prediction  model  can  be  used  to  investigate 
multiple types of omics data, such as The Cancer Genome 
Atlas datasets. The recent developments of single-molecule 
sequencing technologies (i.e., third-generation sequencing) 
has facilitated integrated analysis of multi-omics data. There 
is no doubt that multi-omics data will lead to improvement 
of risk prediction models.
