Introduction 

Hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC)  is  one  of  the  most 
prevalent  cancers,  including  stomach  and  lung  cancer,  in 
Korea  (National  Statistical  Office,  2001 ).  Aflatoxin  B1, 
chronic  infection  of  hepatitis  B virus (HBV)  and  hepatitis C 
virus  (HCV)  are  known  as  major  risk  factors  for  HCC 
(Bradley,  1999).  However,  the  molecular  mechanism  of 
liver cell  transformation  has  not been  determined yet.  The 
development of  HCC  has  been  reported  to  be  a multistep 
process  (Sugimura,  1992).  Inactivation  of  tumor 
suppressor  gene  and  activation  of  oncogene  caused  by 
intragenic  mutations  or  by  deletions  can  lead  a  cell  to  a 
transformed  state.  Several  genomic  regions  have  been 
reported  to  be  involved  in  liver  carcinogenesis.  These 
regions  are  mostly  located  on  chromosome  arms  1 p,  4q, 
5q,  6q,  8p,  9p,  11 p,  13q,  16q  and  17p,  indicating  that 
dysfunctions  of  diverse  tumor  or  metastasis  suppressor 
genes  located  on  these  chromosomes  are  involved  in  the 
development  of  HCC  (Boige  eta/.,  1997;  Nagai  eta/., 
1997). 

The  studies on  loss of heterozygosity (LOH)  have been 
used  for  detection  of  chromosomal  regions  deleted  in 
various  types  of  cancer.  By  analyzing  deleted  genes  in 
cancer patients,  tumor suppressor genes, such  as  BRCA2 
and  OPC4,  were  identified  (Hahn  eta/.,  1995;  Wooster et 
a/.,  1995). Therefore,  detecting the regions associated with 
high  LOH  frequency  is  important for  identifying  negatively 
regulating  genes  participating  in  tumor growth,  such  as 
tumor suppressor  genes  (TSGs).  High  frequency  of  LOH 
has  been  observed  on  human  chromosome  16q  in  HCC, 
as well as in other cancers including breast cancer (Cieton(cid:173)
Jansen  eta/.,  1999),  prostate  cancer (Carteret a/.,  1990). 
and Wilm' s tumor (Maw eta/.,  1992), indicating that one or 
more TSGs may exist on  16q. It would be  useful to define 
commonly  and  minimally  deleted  regions  on  a  specific 
chromosomal  region  of  patients  to  search  the  possible 
TSGs.  Even  after the  completion  of  the  human  genome 
project,  there  are  still  a  considerable  amount  of  gaps 
between  certain  sequence  contigs.  BAC  contig  maps  of 
human  chromosomes  are  still  a  valuable  resource  for 
positional  cloning  of  the  genes  associated  with  diseases 
and,  in  particular,  for  sequencing  of  the  gaps  present  on 
the human genome draft sequences. 

In  this  study,  we  report  five  commonly  occurring  LOH 
regions  on  human  16q  from  Korean  HCC  patients  and  a 
BAC contig map for one of the LOH  regions with complete

Abstract 

Loss  of  heterozygosity  (LOH)  has  been  used  to  detect 
deleted  regions  of  a  specific  chromosome  in  cancer cells. 
LOH  on  chromosome  16q  has  been  reported  to  occur 
frequently  in  progressed  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC). 
Liver tissues from  37  Korean  HCC  patients were  analyzed 
for  LOH  by  using  25  polymorphic  microsatellite  markers 
distributed along  16q.  Out  of the  37  HCC  patients  studied, 
21  patients (56.8%) showed  LOH  in  various  regions of 16q 
with  at  least  one  polymorphic  marker.  Puring  the  analysis 
of these 21  LOH cases,  6 patients showed interstitial  LOHs 
in which the boundary of the LOH  region  was defined. With 
two  rounds  of  LOH  analysis,  five  commonly  occurring 
interstitial LOH regions were identified;  16q21-22.1, 16q22.2 
- 22.3,  16q22.3,  16q23.2 and  16q23.3 - 24.1.  Among  the 
five  LOH  regions  the  16q23.3 - 24.1  region  has  been 
reported  to  be  related  with  chromosome  instability.  A 
complete physical  map,  which covers the 3.2  Mb  region  of 
16q23.3- 24.1  (016S402  and  016S486),  was constructed 
to  identify  novel  candidate  tumor  suppressor  genes.  We 
provide the  minimally tiling  path  map  consisting of 28  BAC 
clones.  There  was  one  gap  between  NT _1 0422.11  and 
NT _019609.9  of  the  human  genome  sequence  contig 
(NCBI  sequence build  33,  April 29,  2003).  This gap can  be 
filled  by  sequencing  the  R-1425M20  clone  which  bridges 
these sequence contigs.

sequences  in  this  region  is  closed  with  our BAC  contig 
sequence. 

Materials and Methods 
Tissue specimens 
HCC  and  non-tumorous tissues  were  prepared  from  37 
patients  who  had  undergone  hepatectomy  at  the 
Department of  Surgery,  Korea  Cancer  Center  Hospital. 
Tumor and  non-tumor samples  were  kept frozen  at -70°C 
after removed from patients until DNA extraction. 

Differentiation  states  of tumor samples  were  ranged 
from  stages 1 to 4.  There were 32 cases positive for HBV. 
Average  tumor size  was  6.2  em.  The  age  of patients was 
ranged from 24 to 67. 

Microsatellite polymorphic markers 
The  sequences of  dinucleotide polymorphic  markers were 
obtained  by  searching  the  Genome  Database  (GDB: 
http://www.gdb.org)  and from  a previous  report  (Dogget et 
a/.,  1995).  The  sequences  of  tetranucleotide  repeat 
markers  and  somatic  cell  hybrid  panels  were  kindly 
provided by Dr. Callen (Women' s and Children' s Hospital, 
Adelaide,  Australia).  Polymorphic  markers  retaining  high 
heterozygosity score  more than  0.7 were  selected,  except 
two markers (D16S416 and D16S518). 

LOH analysis 
Genomic DNA was prepared from the tissues as described 
by  Sambrook et a/.  (2001 ).  PCR  was  performed  under a 
standard  condition  (Yeh  eta/.,  1996).  The  PCR  products 
were  labeled  with  a-[32P]-dCTP.  Amplified  DNAs  were 
subjected to 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 

The  gel  was  dried  and  processed  for  autoradiography. 
Allelic  loss  was  scored  when  band  intensity of one  allelic 
marker was  significantly  decreased  (more  than  50%)  in 
tumor DNA compared to that in normal DNA. 

Initial screening of high density membrane 
High  density filters  of  human  D1/D2  were  prepared  by 
using  Q-Bot  (Genetiks)  and  RPCI-11  library  was 
purchased  from  Children' s  Hospital  Okland  Research 
Institute.  Probes  were  prepared  by  amplifying  gDNA  with 
PCR  and  by  labeling  with  a-(32P]-dCTP.  Ten  to  twenty 
probes  were  pooled  and  hybridized  to  each  high  density 
filter.  True  positive  clones  were  selected  and  then 
subjected  to  deconvolution  experiments  to  identify clones 
specific to individual probes (Cao eta/., 1999). 

Fingerprinting 
Each clone was digested with restriction enzyme, labeled 

with  a-[32P]-dATP  and  AMV-RT,  subjected  to  poly(cid:173)
acrylamide  gel  electrophoresis,  processed  for  autora(cid:173)
diography and the  image was then  analyzed with the FPC 
2.5 software (see Cao eta/., 1998 for detailed procedure). 

Gap filling 
Nine  contigs  were  initially obtained.  Gaps  were  filled  by 
chromosome  walking.  Briefly,  probes  were  prepared  from 
BAC  end  sequences  of  each  contig  which  were  used  to 
screen  high  density  membranes.  End  sequences  of  each 
positive  BAC  clone  were  determined  and  PCR  primers 
were  designed from  the  BAC  end  sequences.  All  positive 
BAC  clones  obtained  from  each  screening  were  used  as 
PCR templates.  The generation of PCR  product was  used 
as criteria  for determining  overlap.  The  end  sequences  of 
outermost  BAC  clones  were  used  to  prepare  new  probes 
for the second round screening. Chromosome walking was 
continued  until  gaps  were  closed.  Gap  closing  was  also 
determined by PCR. 

Results 
Polymorphic marker analysis 
Forty  polymorphic  markers with  high  heterozygosity score 
(higher than 0.70 according to GDB) were initially selected. 
Some  markers,  however,  having  lower heterozygosity 
score  than  0.7  were  selected  to  keep  marker intervals 
approximately  3  Mb.  The  markers  consist  of  thirty  one 
dinucleotide  and  nine  tetranucleotide  repeat  polymorphic 
markers.  To  validate  these  markers,  selected  markers 
were  subjected  to  PCR-based  analysis.  As  a  result,  21 
dinucleotide  polymorphic  markers  and  4 tetranucleotide 
repeat  markers were  finally  selected to  be  useful  for LOH 
analysis on HCC cases. The heterozygosity scores of each 
marker in  the  GDB  database  were  compared  to  those 
obtained  from  the  LOH  study  of  Korean  HCC  cases.  It 
should  be  noted  that  some  markers  showed  higher 
dissimilarity  in  heterozygosity  score  in  Korean  population 
compared  to  those  in  the  database  (see  Table  1).  This 
discrepancy  in  marker informativeness  may  be  due  to 
ethnic  difference  (Uthoff  et  a/.,  2002).  Although 
heterozygosity  score  information  of  tetranucleotide  repeat 
markers could  not  be  obtained  from  GDB  database,  we 
chose  them  because  of  marker  intervals.  The 
heterozygosity scores  of the  tetranucleotide  polymorphic 
markers  ranged  from  0.4  to  0.71  in  37  Koreans. 
Tetranucleotide  repeat  markers  showed  single  specific 
bands.  On  the  other  hand,  dinucleotide  repeat  markers 
showed multiple bands ranging from 4 to 6 (Fig.  1 ). Multiple 
bands from  dinucleotide repeat markers might be occurred 
due to polymerase slippage.

LOH analysis and deletion mapping on 
human chromosome 16q 
LOH  mapping  was  carried  out  in  two  steps  in  this  study. 
Overall  LOH  profile on  16q was examined in the first step. 
Markers that  have  long  intervals  (3  Mb  in  average)  were 
chosen for the first step  LOH  analysis,  and the  rough  LOH 
regions  were  determined.  In  the  second  step,  additional 
markers  were  used  to  reduce  the  length  of  each  LOH 
region. 

Eighteen  markers,  showing  3  Mb  of  interval  size  in 
average,  were  used  in  the  first  step  of  LOH  analysis. 
Twenty one  out  of  37  HCC  patients  showed  LOH  with  at 
least  one  polymorphic  marker,  however,  16  patients 
showed no  LOH  at all.  Fifteen out of the 21  LOH-showing 
patients  were  observed  to  have  extensive  deletions 
throughout  the  entire  long  arm  of  chromosome  16,  while 
the other six patients showed  interstitial  LOHs on the  16q. 
The position  of each  marker was  determined according  to 
the  sequence  contig  of  human  genomic  sequence 
database  and  Genethon  linkage  map  provided  by  NCB\. 
Four common  LOH  regions were observed  in  the first step 
LOH  analysis.  The  first  region  was  located  between 
0168503 and  0168512 marker (10.48  Mb  in  length). The 
second  region  was  located  between  0168512  and 
01683098  (7.38  Mb).  The  third  region  was  located 
between  0168505  and  0168402  (1.62Mb).  The  fourth 
region  was  located  between  0168402 and  0168486  (3.2 
Mb). 

To  reduce  the  size  of  each  LOH  region,  we  further

performed  LOH  analysis by using 7 additional  polymorphic 
markers located  inside  of  each  LOH  region.  Four markers 
(01683019,  0168397,  0168496  and  01683066)  were 
used  to  reduce  the  length  of  the  first  region.  Because 
01683019,  0168397  and  0168496 showed  LOHs  or 
homozygosities  in  the  six  interstitial  LOH  cases,  these 
markers did  not contribute to  reduce  the  length  of the  first 
LOH  region.  01683066 was located inside of the first LOH 
region  and  0.73  Mb apart from  0168516. This  marker did 
not  show  LOH  in  two  patients.  The  first  region,  therefore, 
could  be  reduced  by  0.37  Mb.  0168266,  01683090  and 
0168516  markers  were  used  to  reduce  the  second  LOH 
region. 

01683090  showed  retention  of  LOH.  Both  0168266 
and  0168516  showed  no  LOH  in  three  cases.  0168266 
was  located  approximately  in  the  middle  of  the  second 
LOH region, and the markers neighboring on both right and 
left side of  0168266 showed  LOH.  Therefore,  the  second 
LOH  region  could  be  divided  into  two  LOH  regions  (LOH 
region  2  and  3).  The  location  of  0168516 was  2.63  Mb 
apart  inside  from  01683098,  and  it showed  no  LOH.  The 
length of LOH  region 3 was, therefore, reduced to 2.63 Mb. 
No  additional  markers were  found  in  the  third  and  fourth 
LOH  regions  in  the  first  step  analysis.  The  size  of  these 
regions, therefore, could not be reduced. 

By combining the first and second step of LOH analysis, 
five  LOH  regions  were  obtained.  Region  1 was  located  at 
16q21-22.1  between  markers  0168503 and  01683066, 
region.2  at  16q22.2- 22.3  between  0168512  and 
0168266,  region  3  at  16q22.3  between  0168266  and 
0168516,  region  4  at  16q23.2  between  0168505  and 
0168402,  and  region  5  at  16q23.3  - 24.1  between 

104  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1 (2) 101-107, December 2003 

D16S402 and  D16S486. The lengths of LOH  region  1 to 5 
were 9.7,  2.6,  2.4,  1.6 and 3.2  Mb,  respectively.  The  LOH 
analysis data and position of markers were summarized as 
an integrated map in Fig. 2. 

Relationship between clinicopathological 
data and LOH 
Relationship  between  the  LOH  occurrence  and 
clinicopathological  parameters  was  analyzed.  No 
significant  difference  was  observed  in  gender,  age  and 
status of hepatitis viruses between  LOH  patients and  non(cid:173)
LOH  patients.  Big  difference  was,  however,  observed  in 
average tumor size of LOH  patients compared to those of 
non-LOH  patients.  The  average  size  of  tumor  in  LOH 
patients was approximately 2 em larger than those in  non(cid:173)
LOH  patients  (data not shown).  The average a-fetoprotein 
level  of  the  patients  showing  LOH  was  35.7  t.tg/ml.  This 
value is much higher than that of the patients showing non(cid:173)
LOH  (488  ng/ml  in  average).  However,  there  is  still  no 
evidence at the  molecular level  to  explain  the  significance 
of this relationship. 

Physical mapping of the LOH region 5 
Our final  goal  is  to  isolate  novel  gene(s)  which  is(are) 

related  with  HCC.  FRA 16D,  located  in  the  region  5,  was 
reported  to  be  related  to  chromosome  instability (Doggett 
eta/,  1995).  No  TSGs  have  been  reported  yet  in  this 
region. We, therefore,  decided to generate a physical map 
between  D16S402  and  D15S486  (16q23.3  - 16q24.1)  by 
using BAC clones.  Human BAC library A was screened by 
a PCR-based  method as  previously described  (Kim eta/., 
1996).  Nine  positive  BACs  were  obtained  by  using  10 
STSs,  the  positions  of  which  were  determined  with  the 
previous  YAC-based  physical  map  of  chromosome  16 
(Doggett eta/.,  1995). The  nine  BACs were  digested with 
Notl  enzyme,  subjected  to  preparative  pulsed  field  gel 
electrophoresis,  the  inserts  isolated  from  the  gel  and  the 
isolated inserts used as probes for the screening of human 
D1  and D2 library. Seventy eight BACs were obtained from 
high  density  membrane  screening.  The  false  positive 
clones  were  removed  by  Southern  hybridization.  Thirteen 
and thirty one clones were  identified as real  positives from 
library  D1  and  library  D2,  respectively.  Six  contigs  were 
obtained  by  fingerprinting  the  positive  BACs  from  A,  D1, 
and D2 library. 

Chromosome  walking  was  carried  out  to  fill  the  gaps 
located  among  those  six  contigs.  BACs  located  at  the 
terminal  regions  of  each  contig  were  subjected  to

sequencing.  BAC  end  sequences  were  used  to  generate 
new STS  markers.  01  and  02  library  screening  was 
carried  out  with  the  probes  corresponding  to  these  BAC 
end sequence markers.  By repeating BAC end sequencing 
and chromosome walking, four gaps were filled. There was 
still  one gap left between the first five  contigs and the sixth 
contig with  01  and  02 library,  but this gap was filled by the 
RPCI-11  library screening. 

By  using  the  end-sequenced  BACs  as  starting  points 
and  also  by  adding  minimally  overlapping  BACs  to  each 
other,  minimal  tiling  path  was  constructed,  spanning 
between 016S402 and 016S486 in  1.5X coverage (Fig. 3). 
Mega BLAST search was performed to find the location of 
each  STS  marker,  including  the  BAC  end  sequences,  on 
the human genomic sequence database in  NCBI. One gap 
existed  on  the  sequence  contig  of  human  genome 
sequence  at  NCBI  (Sequence  Build  33,  April  29,  2003). 
This gap was bridged by a R-1425M20 clone. We identified 
89  STS  markers  and  128  BAC  clones  in  these  regions 
(data is available upon request). 

Discussion 

In  this  study,  we  constructed  a  deletion  map  of  16q  by 

using  LOH  analysis  and  constructing  a  physical  map  on 
one  of  the  LOH  regions.  It  is  important to  define  the 
commonly  deleted  region  in  human  cancers  to  isolate 
gene(s)  related  to  growth  inhibition.  Five  interstitial  LOH 
regions were located on  16q.  It has been  reported that the 
LOH  region  1 contains  genes  related  to  metastasis  of 
cancer cell  (Nam eta/., 2002).  Interestingly,  16q contains 8 
cadherin gene clusters. 

Among  these,  E-cadherin,  cadherin  11,  cadherin  16, 
cadherin  3 and cadherin  5 are located on  LOH  region  1.  It 
is  possible that the  LOH  region  1 is broader than the other 
LOH  regions  because  the  cadherin  gene  cluster  is  widely 
spread throughout the  entire  region  1.  016S515 marker in 
LOH  region  2  was  reported  to  show  23.3%  of  LOH 
frequency  in  Taiwanese (Chou eta/.,  1998).  However, this 
marker showed 65.5% of LOH  frequency in  Koreans.  This 
difference  in  LOH  frequency  was  possibly  originated  from 
the  cause  of  HCC  development  or treatment  of  HCC 
patients.  It  has  been  reported  that  LOH  was  frequently 
observed  in  the  LOH  region  3  from  HCC  patients.  In 
addition,  the  CTRB  locus  inside  of  the  LOH  region  3 was 
also  reported  to  be  a  commonly  deleted  region  in  HCC 
(Tsuda  eta/.,  1990;  Yakicier eta/.,  2001).  Chromosome 
16q23.1-24.1,  including  the  LOH  regions  4  and  5,  was

reported  to  be  a consistently  deleted  region  among  the 
patients  analyzed  by  using  comparative  genomic 
hybridization  (CGH)  studies  in  HCC  (Balsara et at.,  2001). 
High frequency of LOH in this CGH region from breast and 
prostate  cancer was  reported  (Gunnarsson eta/.,  2000; 
Matsuyama et at., 2003). 

Although  the  human  genome  sequencing  was 

announced  to  be  finished,  there  are  still  many sequence(cid:173)
gaps  in  the  human  genome  sequence.  We  found  one 
sequence-gap  in  LOH  region  5 located at  16q23.3 - 24.1. 
Based  on  complete  physical  map,  gap  between 
NT _1 0422.11  and  NT _019609.9  was  bridged  by the  R-
1425M20 BAC  clone.  Sequencing of  R-1425M20 could fill 
the  gap  between  those  sequence  contigs.  Thirty-three 
genes  were  predicted  to  be  located  in  LOH  region  5 
according  to  the  NCBI  map  viewer  (Build  34  Version  1 ). 
Among  these,  one  down  regulated  gene  (OKL38)  in  liver 
cancer was  identified  by the  virtual  northern  provided  by 
National  Cancer  Institute's Cancer Genome  Anatomy 
Project  (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov).  The  ratio  of  OKL38 
expression  level  in  HCC  to  normal  liver was  0/6.  We  are 
currently  examining the  expression  level  of the  OKL38 
gene  in  HCC  patients.  Because  LOH  analysis  does  not 
give  information  if  the  LOH  regions  are  located  in  cis(cid:173)
position  or  trans-position  on  sister chromatids,  it  is 
necessary to carry out haplotype analysis to determine the 
phase of deletions on chromosome.
