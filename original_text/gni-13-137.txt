Selective sweep can cause genetic differentiation across populations, which allows for the identification of possible causative 
regions/genes  underlying  important  traits.  The  pig  has  experienced  a  long  history  of  allele  frequency  changes  through 
artificial selection in the domestication process. We obtained an average of 329,482,871 sequence reads for 24 pigs from 
three pig breeds: Yorkshire (n = 5), Landrace (n = 13), and Duroc (n = 6). An average read depth of 11.7was obtained 
using whole-genome resequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 platform. In this study, cross-population extended haplotype 
homozygosity and cross-population composite likelihood ratio tests were implemented to detect genes experiencing positive 
selection for the genome-wide resequencing data generated from three commercial pig breeds. In our results, 26, 7, and 14 
genes from Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc, respectively were detected by two kinds of statistical tests. Significant evidence 
for  positive  selection  was  identified  on  genes  ST6GALNAC2  and  EPHX1  in  Yorkshire,  PARK2  in  Landrace,  and  BMP6, 
SLA-DQA1, and PRKG1 in Duroc.These genes are reportedly relevant to lactation, reproduction, meat quality, and growth 
traits. To understand how these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related positive selection affect protein function, we 
analyzed the effect of non-synonymous SNPs. Three SNPs (rs324509622, rs80931851, and rs80937718) in the SLA-DQA1 
gene  were  significant  in  the  enrichment  tests,  indicating  strong  evidence  for  positive  selection  in  Duroc.  Our  analyses 
identified  genes  under  positive  selection  for  lactation,  reproduction,  and  meat-quality  and  growth  traits  in  Yorkshire, 
Landrace, and Duroc, respectively.

Introduction

Artificial  selection  is  an  aspect  of  the  process  of 
domestication  development  [1]  that  is  reflected  in  the 
evolution of domestic animals. Positive selection increases 
the  fitness  of  adaptive  traits  [2].  Previous  research  has 
demonstrated  that  the  selection  and  mating  of  domestic 

animals is determined by human-generated pressures, and 
the  genetic  differences  resulting  from  artificial  selection 
have  led  to  economic  development  [3].  Among  domestic 
animals, the pig has experienced a particularly long history 
of  haplotype  changes  through  artificial  selection  in  the 
process of domestication [2, 4]. For most of their history, 
studies have found positive selection in Yorkshire, Landrace, 
and Duroc to be associated with specific genes related to

lactation  [5,  6],  reproduction  [7],  meat  quality  [8],  and 
growth [3] trait. Given the importance of these traits to the 
pig farming industry, it is necessary to detect the signals of 
positive selection in pigs. 

Identifying genomic selection using high-density single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays or sequencing data is 
useful for the discovery  of  putative  trait-related genes.  A 
variant  under  selection  pressure  between  and/or  within 
populations  will  show  an  increase  of  the  frequency  of 
particular alleles or linkage disequilibrium (LD) of SNPs. 
Selective  sweep  can  cause  genetic  differentiation  across 
populations [9]. The cross-population extended haplotype 
homozygosity  (XPEHH)  [10]  and  cross-population  com-
posite likelihood ratio (XPCLR) [9] tests are widely used to 
search for signals of selection between the populations. The 
XPEHH test detects the occurrence of selection based on 
measuring LD, while the XPCLR test considers the spatial 
patterns of allele frequencies of SNPs [9]. The XPCLR test is 
a likelihood method that uses differentiation of multi-locus 
allele  frequencies  between  two  populations  to  detect 
selective sweep. Selection with significant signals can break 
up the haplotype structures more rapidly than mutation or 
recombination processes [11]. 

In this study, the XPEHH and XPCLR between-popula-
tion methods were implemented to detect positive selection 
in three pig breeds through resequencing using the Illumina 
HiSeq2000 platform (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 
To further explain the biological implications of positively 
selected  genes,  functional  enrichment  analysis  was  per-
formed.

Methods 
Sampling and whole-genome sequencing

We used genomic DNA samples gathered from 12 males 
and 12 females of three pig breeds: Yorkshire, 2 males and 3 
females;  Landrace,  7  males  and  6  females;  and  Duroc,  3 
males and 3 females. Blood samples were collected for DNA 
extraction.  Sample  collections  and  DNA  quality  check 
procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. Next, we constructed genomic DNA libraries 
for each sample using TruSeq DNA Library kits (Illumina). 
The paired-end library was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 
2000 sequencing platform. 

The pair-end sequence reads were aligned to the reference 
pig genome sequence from University of California, Santa 
Cruz  (UCSC;  http://genome.ucsc.edu/;  susScr3)  using 
Bowtie2  with  the  default  setting.  We  used  the  following 
open-source software: Bowtie2, Picard tools 1.94 (http:// 
picard.sourceforge.net),  Samtools  0.1.19  [12],  Genome 
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) 2.6.4 [13], and VCFtools 4.0 [14] 

for  resequencing  data  processing  and  SNP  calling.  Sub-
stitution  calling  was  performed  using  GATK  Unified-
Genotyper.  We  phased  the  haplotypes  for  the  entire  pig 
populations using BEAGLE [15]. Picard tools was used for 
duplicate  read  removal  and  all  mate-pair  information 
confirmation. Samtools was used for indexing the results 
from bam files and calculating the mapped reads using the 
flagstat option. GATK was used for realignment and SNP 
calling  from  resequencing  data,  and  VCFtools  was  used 
when VCF files were handled. After filtering, non-biallelic 
SNPs were excluded. 

Detection of selective sweep 

To detect selective sweep, we implemented two between- 
populations methods (XPEHH and XPCLR) between each 
pairwise breed contrast. These statistics used the phased 
data based on the SNP genotypes obtained from the whole- 
genome  resequencing.  For  each  contrast,  XPEHH  and 
XPCLR  were  implemented  across  all  SNPs  between  the 
three pig breeds to identify potential positive selection. We 
used a p-value of ＜0.01 for XPEHH and the top 1,000 genes 
in XPCLR as the cutoff criteria. These tests revealed that 
some SNPs might have been under positive selection in the 
Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc breeds, respectively. 

Bioinformatic analysis of genes under positive 
selection 

Based on the findings of positive selection, enrichment 
analysis was performed to examine the biological functions 
of genes in detected regions. In this study, regions with SNPs 
under positive selection were extended approximately 10 kb 
upstream  and  downstream  [16].  We  assembled  genes 
located within the extended region using the RefGene from 
the UCSC Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/; ver. 
hg19). Gene enrichment analysis was performed GO terms 
[17],  including  biological  process,  molecular  function, 
cellular component, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis [18] using the DAVID 
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) tool [19]. 

Analysis of SNP effects 

To identify non-synonymous coding SNPs (nsSNPs), we 
analyzed SNP effects using the SNPeffect database, which 
detects  phenotypic  effects  of  variation  (http://snpeffect. 
vib.be/) [20]. For more exact results, a Fisher's exact test was 
performed to identify breed-specific amino acids in genes 
with nsSNPs. The statistical test was used to analyze 2 × 2 
contingency tables composed with two factors. Considering 
our purpose, one factor was breed information, and the other 
was amino acid information. From the 2 × 2 contingency 
tables, we expected to observe enrichment of specific amino

acids in specific breeds at each position. All data parsing and 
calculations were performed using Python (ver. 2.5) and R 
(ver. 3.1.2).

Results
Sequencing and alignments

Genome-wide  positive  selection  in  pigs  was  identified 
using  whole-genome  resequencing,  in  which  we  aligned 
whole genome reads from three pig breeds, Yorkshire, Land-
race, and Duroc, to the pig reference sequence. These breeds 
have undergone positive selection with strong signals for 
lactation,  reproduction,  meat  quality,  and  growth.  On 
average, ∼329,482,871 sequences were mapped to the pig 
reference genome from the University of California, Santa 
Cruz  (UCSC)  Genome  Browser  (assembly  ID:  susScr3) 
using  Bowtie2.  Table  1  provides  a  summary  of  the 
alignments of 24 pig samples. Over 92.8% of all reads were 
aligned to the pig reference genome. Pig resequencing data 
with an average read depth of 11.7× were generated using 
the  Illumina  HiSeq2000  platform.  A  total  of  18,440,443 
SNPs were identified using the GATK.

Selective sweep detected by between-population 
methods

To  detect  signals  of  positive  selection  in  the  three  pig 
breeds,  two  between-population  methods  (XPEHH  and 
XPCLR) were implemented with phased haplotypes based 
on pairwise populations of Yorkshire-Landrace (Y-L), York-
shire-Duroc (Y-D), Landrace-Yorkshire (L-Y), Landrace-Duroc 
(L-D), Duroc-Yorkshire (D-Y), and Duroc-Landrace (D-L). 
Here, for Y-L, Yorkshire was regarded as the observed po-
pulation and Landrace as the reference population. XPEHH 
and XPCLR scores denote selection that happened in the 
observed population. As a result, several regions of positive 
selection were identified at a significance level of p-value 
＜ 0.01 [21] in XPEHH, and the top 1,000 genes in XPCLR. 
Table 2 summarizes the numbers of genes under significant 
positive  selection,  which  were  identified  in  the  six  breed 
pairs (Y-L, Y-D, L-Y, L-D, D-L, and D-Y). For example, for the 
Y-L breed pair, which detects selection that occurred in the 
Yorkshire  population  when  compared  to  the  Landrace 
population,  376  and  1,869  genes  were  under  positive 
selection based on the XPEHH and XPCLR tests, respec-

tively. For the Y-D breed pair, when using the XPCLR test, 
1,498 genes were under positive selection with 3,978 SNPs 
detected in Yorkshire, with Duroc as the reference popula-
tion. By the consensus set of genes under positive selection 
identified with both the XPEHH and XPCLR tests, 26, 7, and 
14 genes were identified in Yorkshire, Landrace, and Duroc, 
respectively (Fig. 1). For example, the 26 Yorkshire genes 
identified by both the XPCLR and XPEHH tests in both the 
Y-L and Y-D comparisons, and so effectively detected four

The biological functions of genes under positive 
selection

terms  related 

We  performed  functional  enrichment  analysis  on  the 
following genes under positive selection using DAVID ver. 
6.7:  ST6GALNAC2  and  EPHX1  in  Yorkshire;  PARK2  in 
Landrace; and BMP6, SLA-DQA1, and PRKG1 in Duroc. The 
results revealed enrichment of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and  Genomes  (KEGG)  Pathway 
to 
metabolism, diseases, genetic or environmental information 
processing,  and  organismal  systems  (Table  3).  The  gene 
BMP6 acts as a hedgehog signaling pathway; the hedgehog 
protein  is  an  important  regulator  of  slow  oxidative  fiber 
clustering and is distributed throughout the tissue in pigs. 
Previous research has reported that BMP6 plays an important 
role in meat quality [8]. Among the 26 positively selected 
genes  in  Yorkshire,  the  ST6GALNAC2  gene  is  expressed 
during lactation, contributing to immune-related functions 
[5]. Up-regulation of the EPHX1 (epoxide hydrolase 1) gene 
occurs during mammary gland involution. Nakamura et al. 
[6] suggested that EPHX1 is involved in the initial stage of 
involution.  The  SEMA5A  (semaphoring  5A)  gene  for 
Yorkshire reported strong candidate gene which affects the 
milk  production  traits  for  economic  traits  in  cattle.  The 

estrogen receptor (ER) gene for Landrace reported that mice 
lacking ER α show severe reproduction [7]. This implies 
that the ER gene might be a positively selected lactation trait 
in pigs. The Gene Ontology (GO) terms included immune 
system  process  (SLA-DQA1)  and  metabolic  process 
(PRKG1) for Duroc (Supplementary Table 2). Williams et al. 
[3]  reported  that  a  low  level  of  chronic  immune  system 
resulted in greater growth in pigs. These results suggest that 
the 26, 7, and 14 population-specific genes with significant 
signals  may  result  from  potential  positive  selection  for 
lactation  in  Yorkshire,  reproduction  in  Landrace,  and 
meat-quality and growth traits in Duroc. 

SNP effects for population-specific genes

To understand how SNPs related positive selection affect 
protein  function,  we  analyzed  SNP  effects  using  the 
SNPeffect database. We identified two genes, SLA-DQA1 and 
EPHX1, with nsSNPs showing evidence of positive selection 
in  D-Y,  respectively  (Fig.  2,  Supplementary  Table  1).  To 
obtain accurate results, Fisher's exact test was performed on 
these  two  genes.  The  total  numbers  of  statistical  tests 
performed on the non-synonymous genes were 20 × 3 × 13 
(number  of  cases  of  amino  acids  ×  number  of  breeds  × 
number  of  non-synonymous  amino  acid  positions)  for 
SLA-DQA1, and 20 × 3 × 4 for EPHX1. From the enrichment 
tests,  we 
three  positions  (rs324509622, 
rs80931851, and rs80937718) that were significant under a 
Bonferroni-adjusted  p-value  of  <0.05  with  an  alternative 
hypothesis: the odds ratio is greater than 1 in the SLA-DQA1 
gene. The p-values of the three non-synonymous positions 
were 5.20e-05, 5.20e-05, and 7.43e-06, respectively. As a 
note, the above three significant enrichment results were 
observed  only  in  the  Duroc  breed.  The  non-synonymous 
positions  showed  strong  evidence  for  positive  selection

useful in detecting selective pressure [9]. Although several 
studies have reported selective sweeps identified using chips 
such as the Illumina Porcine 60K SNP BeadChip [22] in pigs, 
few have identified selective sweeps using whole-genome 
sequencing. Therefore, detecting positive selection in the pig 
genome appears worthwhile.

Here  we  implemented  two  representative  between-po-
pulation methods, XPEHH and XPCLR, to explore positive 
selection. XPEHH is designed to detect near fixation or fixed 
selective  sweeps  by  comparing  haplotypes  between  two 
populations [10]. XPCLR is more robust for SNP discovery 
bias than allele frequency-based methods [9]. XPEHH tests 
whether the SNP site is homozygous in one population and 
polymorphic in another by comparing the extended haplo-
type homozygosity score of two populations on a core SNP. A 
negative XPEHH value indicates that selection happened in 
the  reference population [15]. XPCLR  was designed  as  a 
multi-locus composite likelihood ratio method to avoid the 
bias influence in SNP discovery. XPEHH and XPCLR find 
one core SNP and grid window using multi-locus informa-
tion, and thus these tests identify more significant selection 
regions than Fst or Tajima’s D [23]. Identifying significant 
genome-wide selection regions with multiple loci using a 
single-marker Fst test is difficult. Therefore, for multiple SNP 
methods, we carried out XPEHH and XPCLR and excluded 

Fst  and  Tajima’s  D.  XPEHH  assumes  an  approximately 
normal distribution. Park et al. [16] determined empirical 
p-values using the top 1% of the significance, and our results 
show that these significance cutoffs are more reasonable. In 
addition,  positive  selection  identified  by  multiple  test 
methods is more convincing. 

Bioinformatic analysis of genes under positive selection in 
this study revealed interesting biological information related 
to  lactation,  reproduction,  meat  quality,  and  growth.  We 
identified  several  GO  terms  using  the  DAVID  functional 
annotation  tool.  Immune  system  process  (GO:0002376) 
was  found  to  be  significant  in  Duroc.  Williams  et  al.  [3] 
reported that a low level of chronic immune system resulted 
in greater growth in pigs. This GO term suggests that genes 
with some growth traits may have been under selection in 
the domestication process. Growth traits are referred to as 
important indicators of the immune system. This suggests 
that SLA-DQA1 might play a role in the pig immune system. 
In  addition,  BMP6  and  PRKG1  in  Duroc  had  biological 
pathways related to meat-quality traits. Fonseca et al. [8] 
reported that the BMP6 gene plays a role in increasing the 
quality  of  meat  juiciness  and  tenderness.  Lee  et  al.  [22] 
identified  the  significant  SNPs  located  in  the  BMP6  gene 
related to meat quality through a genome-wide association 
study  using  the  Porcine  60K  BeadChip.  Therefore,  the

(nsSNPs) 

SLA-DQA1  and  BMP6  genes  might  be  effects  of  positive 
selection for growth and meat quality, respectively, in Duroc. 
In Yorkshire, three genes under significant positive selection 
were ST6GALNAC2, EPHX1, and SEMA5A; these genes were 
related to lactation traits in several previous studies. The 
ST6GALNAC2 gene is expressed during lactation [5], EPHX1 
is expressed in the early involution of mammary glands [6], 
and SEMA5A is reportedly related to milk production traits 
in cattle [21]. In Landrace, the ER gene was reported to be 
related to reproduction traits in previous studies. Generally 
ER refers to either ER α or ER β and estrogens are involved 
in differentiation and maintenance of reproductive tissue. 
Krege et al. [7] reported that mice lacking ER α exhibited 
severe reproductive problems. This implies that the ER gene 
could be an effect of positive selection for lactation traits in 

pigs  as  well  as  in  mice.  Our  findings  show  that  several 
significant SNPs were present in genes found to be related to 
lactation, reproduction, meat quality, and growth traits in 
previous studies. These results indirectly support the effects 
of positive selection. Unfortunately, information on many of 
the genes with significant signals has not yet been analyzed. 
Based on SNP analyses for positively selected genes, SLA- 
DQA1  and  EPHX1  genes  exhibited  evidence  of  positive 
selection in D-Y, respectively. However, an enrichment test 
revealed that the three significant amino-acid positions in 
SLA-DQA1 and EPHX1 were not significant.
Our  analyses  suggested  that  several  genes—such  as 
EPHX1,  PARK2,  BMP6,  SLA-DQA1,  PRKG1,  and  ST6GAL-
NAC2—might  have  undergone  positive  selection.  These 
genes  are  associated  with  lactation,  reproduction,  meat

quality, and growth traits. All findings in this study provide 
useful data for the study of pigs, however our results are 
preliminary and need to validate these genes in another set of 
samples.
