A visual analysis approach and the developed supporting technology provide a comprehensive solution for analyzing large 
and  complex  integrated  genomic  and  biomedical  data.  This  paper  presents  a  methodology  that  is  implemented  as  an 
interactive visual analysis technology for extracting knowledge from complex genetic and clinical data and then visualizing 
it in a meaningful and interpretable way. By synergizing the domain knowledge into development and analysis processes, we 
have developed a comprehensive tool that supports a seamless patient-to-patient analysis, from an overview of the patient 
population in the similarity space to the detailed views of genes. The system consists of multiple components enabling the 
complete  analysis  process,  including  data  mining,  interactive  visualization,  analytical  views,  and  gene  comparison.  We 
demonstrate our approach with medical scientists on a case study of childhood cancer patients on how they use the tool to 
confirm existing hypotheses and to discover new scientific insights.

Introduction

Among cancers, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is 
the most common cancer occurring in children and is the 
driving  paradigm  for  the  work  presented  in  this  paper. 
Despite  presenting  with  similar  clinical  features,  ALL 
patients do not always respond in a similar manner to the 
same treatment strategies. The underlying complexities of 
the disease are not always clearly reflected by the clinical 
presentation  or  pathological  results.  Genomic  variation, 
typified by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have 
considerable influence on how humans develop diseases and 
respond to pathogens, chemicals, drugs, vaccines, and other 
agents [1]. Similarly, gene expression patterns in diagnostic 
bone marrow can predict the sub-type of pediatric ALL as 
well as indicate relapse potential [2, 3]. The co-regulated 
activity of genes leads to metabolic actions that are driven by 
small changes in the expression of a large number of genes 
rather  than  large  changes  in  only  a  few  [2].  As  a  result, 

understanding  genomic  data  and  biomedical  data  (e.g., 
annotated  clinical  attributes,  treatment  details,  domain 
ontologies, and patient’s background) is crucial to impro-
ving the diagnosis and treatment of ALL.

As a rule, the knowledge discovery process involves the 
dialog between experts from different domains, including 
laboratory scientists, biostatisticians, computational biolo-
gists, and clinicians. In reality, most techniques were deve-
loped based on statistical analysis with simple visualization 
[4] in an attempt to create techniques that would be appli-
cable in several domains. Basic statistics and visualizations 
without effective interaction and capabilities to control the 
visual  data  mining  process  are  often  insufficient  for  the 
analysis and exploration processes.

Intelligent  visualization  of  complex  genomic  data  will 
therefore  bring  the  insight  of  information  as  well  as  the 
discovery of relationships, non-trivial structures, and irregu-
larities that may pertain to the disease course of the patient. 
Genomic  datasets  are complex data  structures with mea-

surements  for  millions  of  SNPs  affecting  the  activity  of 
several thousand genes. These genomic ‘attributes’ are built 
into models that inform us about individual patients and 
allow  cross-referencing  and  determining  the  interconnec-
tions  between  patients.  It  is  important  then  to  provide 
adequate  tools  in  order  to  visualize  these  models  and 
interactions and to simultaneously examine many attributes 
in  the  context  of  relevant  clinical  properties  that  can  be 
measured in real time for the purpose of assessing a patient’s 
clinical course and directing his clinical management.

Fundamentally, a large number of attributes need to be 
reduced  to  a  manageable  size  so  that  data  visualization 
techniques can be effectively applied. Typical dimensionality 
reduction methods applied to microarray data include prin-
ciple component analysis [5], non-negative matrix factori-
zation  [6],  multidimensional  scaling  [7],  and  local  linear 
embedding [8]. The choice of method to apply depends to 
some extent on the nature of the information expected to be 
encoded  in  the  dataset, since  the  quality of  the  resulting 
reduced matrices can vary across different datasets. Remark-
ably,  most  of  the  visualization  techniques  use  matrix 
heatmaps, genomic coordinates, or networks (or pathways 
metaphor)  to  represent  multidimensional  genomic  data 
[9-11].

- Heatmaps are common graphical representations that are 
used to present genomics values as matrices of colors. 
Matrix heatmaps are typically represented as rectangles 
(such as cBio Cancer Genomics Portal [12] and Caleydo 
StratomeX  [13])  and  occasionally  as  circles  (such  as 
CircleMap [14]).
-  Genomic  Coordinates  represent  oncogenomics  data  by 
showing  alterations  tied  to  their  genomic  loci.  This 
approach  is  only  suitable  for  analyzing  the  genomic 
topography of alternations or for inspecting particular 
genomic loci [9]. Typical techniques in this approach are 
Genomics  Viewer  [15],  UCSC  Cancer  Denomics 
Browser [16], and Savant Genome Browser [17].

- Networks (or graphs) can be used to show changes in state 
for 1) interpreting and exploring large biological net-
works and 2) assembly and curation of pathways (such 
as  Cytoscape  [18],  VANTED  [19],  VisANT  [20], 
NAViGaTOR [21], and Cerebral [22]). 

Visualization techniques for gene expression techniques 
that  include  reasonably  advanced  visualizations  are  pre-
sented in [23-25]. Other good visualization tools show the 
interdependencies of genes by bringing gene expression into 
context with pathways [26] or using dimension reduction 
methods to provide multi-dimensional data visualizations 
[27]. Web-based visual analysis integrates multiple visuali-
zation components, such as scatterplot, phylogenetic tree, 
and genome-wide circus viewer, to enable the analysis [28]. 

Although these tools provide somewhat effective ways for 
the analysis of data, they do not effectively present the data 
such  that  medical  analysts  can  interactively  explore  and 
manipulate the information. Our approach seeks to provide 
a capability for viewing patients in the similarity space based 
on  detailed  genomic  and  gene  of  interest  analysis,  repre-
senting the underlying biological basis for the disease.

This paper presents a novel visual analysis approach and a 
tool  where  medical  scientists  can  interrogate  large  and 
complex genomic and biological data. We focus on patient- 
to-patient comparisons through the biological data, inclu-
ding  background  and  treatment,  and  high-dimensional 
genomic data, including Affymetrix expression microarrays 
and  Illumina  SNP  microarrays.  The  innovation  lies  in  its 
capability of providing seamless and multiple views of data, 
from  overview  of  the  entire  patient  population  with  the 
similarity space to overviews, detailed views, and genes of 
interest (GOI) views of selected items, for patient-to-patient 
comparison.  The  technology  provides  various  ways  to 
display the multi-dimensional data in cooperation with the 
automated  analysis.  In  addition,  by  integrating  domain 
knowledge into the development, we have provided  mea-
ningful visualization for medical data analysis as well as a 
quality  assurance  tool  to  verify  the  effectiveness  of  the 
automated analysis. 

Methods
Biological background and data analysis

The expression and genomic SNP profiles of 100 pediatric 
B-cell  ALL  patients  treated  at  The  Children's  Hospital  at 
Westmead  were  generated  using  Affymetrix  expression 
microarrays (U133A, U133A 2.0, and U133 Plus 2.0) and 
Illumina  NS12  SNP  microarrays,  respectively.  Each  Affy-
metrix expression microarray has 22,277 attributes, while 
each Illumina SNP microarray has 13,917 attributes. Each 
attribute was mapped to a probe of DNA (or a gene), and the 
value  for  each  attribute  corresponded  to  the  expression 
levels or genotype for the gene (each DNA spot contains 
picomoles (1012 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known 
as probes or reporters). The annotations for each gene were 
mapped  on  separate  files.  Expression  microarrays  were 
hybridized  with  diagnostic  bone  marrow  samples  and 
genomic microarrays were hybridized with remission peri-
pheral blood samples. The patients were treated following 
the  Berlin-Frankfurt-Munich  95  (BFM95)  protocol  or  the 
complimentary  Australian  and  New  Zealand  Children's 
Hematology and Oncology Group Study VIII (Study 8).

Using these datasets, we aimed to develop a predictive 
model of treatment outcome by identifying genes capable of 
differentiating patients that survived and those that did not.

To achieve this, we applied an attribute deletion approach: 
identifying and removing genes that were almost certainly 
not  involved  in  a  biological  phenomenon  and  patient 
comparison. We used the attribute importance ranking that 
was implemented in ‘Random forest’ [29] to identify these 
genes. The remaining informative genes were then used to 
build  a  similarity  space  whereby  the  distances  between 
patients in this space were indicative of genetic similarity.

The  expression  values  were  z-score-normalized  within 
each  platform,  concatenated,  and  z-score-normalized  to 
minimize inter- and intra-platform biases. For the genomic 
SNP  profiles,  the  theta  scores  were  used  to  represent 
genotypes. The two datasets were then concatenated, and 
30%  of  all  the  patients  were  withheld  from  the  model- 
building process as a validation set. Eight bootstraps of the 
validation  set's  patients  were  generated,  and  for  each 
bootstrap,  a  random  forest  was  performed.  Each  random 
forest produced an attribute ranking list, and we combined 
these  eight  lists  to  create  a  global  list  of  an  attribute’s 
importance. The expression and SNP values for the top 250 
genes in this global list were used to create a 3D similarity 
space using singular value decomposition－a matrix decom-
position technique [30].

The visual analytics model

Our visual analytics model reflects the importance of the 
domain knowledge in the visual analytics process (see Fig. 
1).  Earlier,  we  mentioned  the  importance  of  validating  a 
method by the outcomes in the discipline that the method is 
used. To do this, visual analytics must adapt to the respective 
discipline and conform to the language and norms expected 
of that discipline. For example, the expression of identified 
significant genes is required to be validated by the domain 
experts  when  the  analysis  is  undertaken  in  independent 
laboratories.

An appropriate visualization helps the analyst to gain an 
understanding of the data and construct knowledge through 
our powerful human visual perception and reasoning capa-
bilities. We provide three interactive views for patient-to-

patient  comparison,  including  1)  overviews  of  the  entire 
patient population in the similarity space, 2) detailed views 
of selected patients, and 3) GOI. We describe these visua-
lizations in the following sections. Domain analysts should 
be able to interact and explore through different views to 
make further discovery of, and insights into, the data. They 
can  obtain  a  better  understanding  of  the  data  and  their 
structures  and  contribute  their  domain  expertise  to  the 
knowledge  discovery  process.  From  the  discovery  of  new 
knowledge, the analyst can evaluate, refine, go beyond, and 
ultimately confirm hypotheses built from previous iterations 
and  automated  analysis.  The  challenge  presented  to  the 
construction  of  appropriate  visualization  is  to  cover  the 
range of visualizing all of the data but making only all of the 
relevant data available to the analyst when it is relevant to do 
so. 

The presented work was developed with strong involve-
ment from cancer researchers at the Children's Hospital in 
Westmead,  Sydney,  Australia,  who  are  experts  in  ALL 
research. The philosophy behind the work is that with this 
new way of looking at genetic and clinical details from the 
perspectives of both domain knowledge and technologies, 
visual analytics can provide a medium for the discovery of 
genetic  and  clinical  problems,  potentially  leading  to  im-
proved ALL treatment strategies.

Interactive visualization

The  microarray  automated  data  analysis  produced  a 
similarity  space  of  the  patients  based  on  their  genetic 
properties. A mapping table of 250 GOI is also created during 
this  process.  In  order  to  present  these  results  in  a  form 
suitable  for  visual  analysis  by  medical  experts,  we  have 
created  interactive  visualizations  that  operate  with  the 
treated data. The interactive visualization is applied to 1) 
present a flexible, changeable, and meaningful display of the 
patient  cohort;  2)  filter,  explore,  and  manipulate  the 
information; and 3) interactively provide the details of both 
the original and processed data on demand. Details of the 
interactive  visualization  components  are  presented  as 
follows.

Overview of patients

The prototype version of the new interactive visualization 
system  provides  the  set  of  views  addressing  the  needs 
described above. The visualization provides a global over-
view of the entire cohort structure and the relative patient- 
to-patient comparisons but then allows the analyst to drill 
into the details of the relationships. Displaying the entire 
visual structure at once allows analysts to move rapidly to 
any location in the space. This makes less effort to navigate 
across the large structures and explore specific parts.

attributed mapping, no obscuration, and perspective correc-
tion. The following sections are limited to the 2D version 
that  was  extended  from  TabuVis  [31].  It  is  a  robust  and 
powerful visual analysis system that provides flexible, custo-
mizable,  and  effective  visualization  for  multidimensional 
data.  Our  innovation  lies  in  the  ability  to  provide  an 
easy-to-use yet effective way to view multidimensional data 
at different angles by mapping various attributes to different 
visual properties. 

Key  aspects  for  visually  analyzing  data  with  multiple 
attributes are quality and appropriateness of the analytical 
platform  whose  presentation  can  be  adjusted  via  domain 
experts. The extended system consists of multiple compo-
nents enabling the analysis process, including data proce-
ssing,  automatic  marks,  customizable  visualization  via 
interaction, control attributes, filtering, statistical display, 
save/open works, and many other figures. 

The overview visualization supports several data types, 
including Integer, Float, Text (string), Boolean (true/false, 
yes/no, or 0/1), Date (with various format), Date and Time, 
and  Percentage.  The  data  types  are  categorized  into  two 
groups:  Categorical  (text  and  boolean)  and  Quantitative 
(integer, float, date, date and time, and percentage). We also 
map  each  data  type  to  a  color  for  better  identification, 
particularly text → dark blue, boolean → blue, integer → red, 
float (and percentage)  → orange, and date (and time)  → 
purple.  The  color  scheme  can  be  easily  modified  via  a 
property file and/or menus when running (see Fig. 2).

Patient’s positions

The  patient’s  positions  are  mapped  into  the  2D  space 
according to his genetic property. This property reflects the

We utilized and extended our former works [31, 32] to 
provide  a  flexible,  simple,  yet  powerful  interface  of  the 
patient population in the similarity space. The visualization 
is capable of displaying both 2D and 3D visual projections of 
the same structure and switching between them from the 
same “area” in the dataset (see Figs. 2 and 3). Although each 
user might have a different preference, the 2D visualization 
is  normally  a  better  choice,  thanks  to  its  simplicity  and 
familiarization to the analyst, its flexibility in interaction and

genetic  similarity  of  the  patients.  Two  patients  are  close 
together if their genes are similar, and conversely, they are 
located far from each other if their genetic properties are 
different. For example, Fig. 2 clearly illustrates two distinc-
tive groups of patients, marked by the dash-line ovals. The 
small group contains mostly deceased patients, while the 
other contains patients that responded well to the treatment 
and survived the disease. The fact that the deceased patients 
are located close to each other in the gene space may support 
the  hypothesis  that  genetic  properties  are  essential  to 
determine whether a patient is likely to respond well in the 
context of the clinical treatment.

Interactive exploration

Mapping property
Rich graphical attributes are employed to provide clinical 
and background properties of the patients. The attributes are 
carefully selected based on the feedback from the medical 
analysts.  The  mapping  property  and  items  can  be  easily 
adjusted, filtered (or hidden), and/or re-mapped to different 
attributes (e.g., patient background and biomedical infor-
mation) via interactive menus to suit the preferences and 
new  requirements.  The  mapping  options  are  label,  axes, 
colors, size, shapes, and visual bars.

Filtering
From the visualization, users can interactively filter out 
uninteresting patients to enhance the view of the associated 
data. Filtering can be applied to all categorical and quan-
titative attributes through interactive menus. The filtering 
allows the researcher/clinician (domain expert) to extract, 
picture,  and  interrogate  specific  features  for  the  patients 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  1,  2014

selected within the similarity space.

Fig. 4 illustrates the view at a navigational stage showing 
all medium-risk patients only. Patient identifications are also 
displayed  in  this  example.  The  figure  highlights  three 
patients  with  similar  clinical  presentations,  such  as  they 
were all stratified as medium risk (MR) (blue color), but 
having diverse outcomes. These patients were managed on 
the two treatment protocols BFM95 (larger size, ALL48) and 
Study  8  (smaller  size,  ALL134  and  ALL323).  With  the 
patients placed into a similarity space based on genetic data, 
we have applied further computational methods to extract, 
visualize, and compare data from the chosen patients. By 
looking  at  the  figure,  we  can  quickly  see  that  ALL323  is 
located  at  the  top-left,  while  the  other  two  patients  are 
positioned closely together at a distance from the first pa-
tient.  This  observation  indicates  that  the  two  surviving 
patients ALL48 and ALL134 are genetically similar and that 
they  are  genetically  different  from  the  deceased  patient, 
ALL323. 

Probe set analysis

The  system  also  provides  a  capability  to  show  and 
compare the property of a particular probe set across the 
patient’s population. This property allows the analysts to 
have a comparative view of how a probe set in a gene behaves 
across  the  population.  Fig.  5  shows  an  example  of  the 
visualization of the population that is colored by the value of 
the probe set “212022_s_at” at the gene “MKI67.” The figure 
clearly indicates the significant difference of patients in the 
bottom-left cluster, which are mostly painted with “gree-
nish” colors, corresponding to the high values, in compa-
rison to reddish colors, corresponding to low values. It raises

larity space.

Clustering

We provide a clustering method to group the patients in 
the similarity space. The clustering is used to enhance the 
visibility  of  patients  in  the  space  as  the  groups  who  are 
potentially sharing similar genomic properties. In addition, 
by using a filtering method, the analysts can quickly filter out

ability  of  choosing  the  initial  values  (or  "seeds")  for  the 
popular k-means clustering algorithm and thus avoiding the 
sometimes poor clustering outcomes found by the standard 
k-means algorithm. The number of clusters can be specified

Patient-to-patient visual analysis

From the overview of all patients, users can select one or 
more patients as well as groups of patients to analyze further. 
At first glance, the analytical view provides full information 
of both genomic and biological data. The layout of the panels 
is as follows: 1) the top-left panel displays information of the 

Affymetrix expression microarrays, 2) the top-right panel 
displays information of the Illumina SNPs, and 3) the middle 
table displays all background information of the patients, 
and the bottom table displays the treatment details (see Fig. 
7). Each probe set in the gene is represented as a point on the 
x-y coordinate system. All genes are distributed orderly from 
top to bottom along the y-coordinate while their values are 
represented  horizontally  at  the  x-coordinate.  This  visual 
projection follows the biological rule―the order in which 
genes  are  displayed  is  sorted  according  to  chromosomal

order.  A  quick  sort  process  is  performed  in  prior  to  the 
visualization. By providing an overview of the entire genetic 
and  biomedical  information,  the  analysts  can  identify 
patterns and abnormalities before exploring further. 

Fig. 7 shows an example of the analytical window of the 
genetic and clinical data corresponding to patient ALL323. 
We can see that the Affymetrix expression microarray values 
of this person vary from －2 to 4, in which the majority of the 
genes’ values are [－1, 0]. It is interesting to see that there is 
a region of loss of heterozygosity in ALL323 (highlighted by 
the red dash-line rectangle).

Following  our  revised  model  of  the  visual  analytics 
process, the analytical exploration is an essential process to 
discover  insight  and  knowledge.  We  provide  a  variety  of 
functions  to  support  the  visual  exploration  and  analysis, 
including  highlighting  the  importance  or  difference,  zoo-
ming, filtering, detailing on demand, and comparing mul-
tiple patients or groups of patients. A user can interactively 
highlight GOI and significantly different genes as well as 
deemphasize the others. This feature allows one to gain a 
better view of those GOI in comparison with the entire gene 
structure. The user can also select the option of displaying 
those GOI only. A semantic zooming technique is applied to 
zoom in (or zoom out) on any particular area of focus (see 
Fig. 8), which allows the analyst to explore and view in detail 
the  genetic  information.  The  level  of  details  is  updated 
dynamically depending on the amount of focused genes and 
the size of the windows. This property ensures the best fit of 
information  on  the  available  space.  In  addition,  detailed 
information of a particular gene is shown when the mouse is 
over the gene (see Fig. 8E and 8F). 

Fig. 8 shows an example of the visualization of patient 
ALL323 (same as Fig. 7) when various options and navi-
gations  are  applied.  In  particular,  the  figure  presents  the 

views when a) the GOI are emphasized from the structure, b)

genes are highlighted, d) the significantly different genes are 
highlighted within the GOI, e) zoom in is applied to SNP 
data (at the right panel), and f) the user zooms in on the gene 
expression  data  (at  the  left  panel)  so  that  the  detailed 
information of probe sets in the genes is displayed.

We  also  provide  a  mechanism  to  compare  multiple 
patients by aligning the analytical windows together. This 
figure is particularly helpful for identifying the similarities, 
differences, regularities, and irregularities of the patients. 
Fig. 9 presents the view of genetic and clinical information of 
the  3  chosen  patients  (highlighted  in  Fig.  4).  First,  the 
complete data of each patient can be directly compared. By 
way of example, the figure indicates a significant difference 
of patient ALL323 when compared to the other two patients 
ALL48  and  ALL134―in  particular,  a  region  of  loss  of 
heterozygosity  in  ALL323,  a  region  that  may  contain  the 
genetic  differences  with  ALL134  and  ALL48,  which  may 
explain the differences in treatment outcome despite being 
considered similar according to the clinical presentation. We 
now describe the technical details for visualization of the 
complete  set  of  SNPs  and  probe  sets  for  the  genes 
represented by the 250 developed features.

Visual analysis of GOI 

The traditional methods usually use heatmaps to show all 
probe sets or genes in the datasets. Although this approach 
can show the overview, its visualizations are very dense. It 
makes it really difficult to analyze those important genes in 
detail  from  the  crowded  population.  Our  system  innova-
tively  focuses  the  interactive  visualization  of  the  GOI 
resulting  from  the  automated  analysis.  By  reducing  the 
overhead of analyzing a large quantity of genes, the analysts

can easily compare the GOI through a large population of 
patients.

The Gene Comparison Interactive Visualization is desig-
ned to allow an analyst to drill down further into the genetics 
and treatment data of patients identified as significant by the 
processes described in the previous sections. This visuali-
zation implements several mechanisms whereby the simi-
larity  and  differences  between  patients  and  groups  of 
patients can be examined in greater detail. 

An important feature of this interactive visualization is 
the  use  of  active  regions  to  indicate  what  the  analyst  is 
currently focused on. Knowing this makes it possible to infer 
what extra information the analyst might find useful and to 
make sure that it is available. This interactive visualization 
consists of 5 separate visual components: A) the primary 
patient probe set heatmap component, B) the gene zoom 
component,  C)  the  color  gradient  and  Gaussian  curve 
component, D) the gene ontology and probe set annotation 
component, and E) the patient biomedical data component 
(see Fig. 10). 

These 5 components are designed to interact with each 
other as well as other components, including the “Patient- 
to-Patient Visual Analysis” (described in section 6) and the 
main  visualization  (described  in  section  5)  in  several 
different ways to assist the analyst to examine the simila-
rities  and  differences  between  significant  patients  and 
significant groups of patients. Fig. 11 presents an overview 
of the visualization of the entire Genes of Interest Visual 
Analysis  module  when  the  3  patients  highlighted  in  the 
similarity space are added. Please note that the figure shows 
both  the  probe  set  heatmap  component  and  the  patient 
information component. 

Results and Discussion

The prototype has been used for analyzing the biomedical 
and genomic datasets of 100 ALL cancer patients, from the 
perspectives of domain knowledge and technologies. In spite 
of the size limitation of the dataset due to the expensive data 
collection, the discovery is quite encouraging in the case of 
ALL  patients.  This  pilot  result  will  place  a  foundation, 
enabling  further  enhancement  and  discovery  using  more 
comprehensive datasets and/or clinical trials. 

On the basis that patients who cluster together will have 
genotypically  similar  tumors,  it  is  then  anticipated  that 
newly  diagnosed  and  as  yet  untreated  patients  will  be 
compared directly to local ‘biologically’ similar neighbors. 
By comparing the management and treatment outcomes for 
patients in this manner, the analyst (i.e., clinician) can glean 
specific information from the local neighbors that will assist 
with their clinical decision making for the individual patient, 
moving  towards  the  ‘personalization’  of  medicine.  The 
analysis has partially confirmed this accuracy of the simi-
larity  space.  To  illustrate  this,  Fig.  11A  highlights  three 
patients  with  the  red-dash  ellipses,  where  the  deceased 
patient ALL123 is at the top left and the surviving patients 
ALL26 and ALL302 are located close to each other at the 
near-bottom  right.  These  patients  have  similar  clinical 
presentations, such as all being stratified as high-risk, but 
diverse outcomes. Fig. 11B shows the detailed views of the 
biomedical and genomic data of the three selected patients, 
showing the significant difference in gene expression values 
of patient ALL123 in comparison with ALL26 and ALL302. 
This  property  may  explain  the  differences  in  treatment 
outcome  of the  three patients  despite  the  similar clinical

presentation  and  treatment  regimen.  The  interactive 
heatmap visualization of the expanded set of SNPs and gene 
expression probe sets used in the array platforms allows the 
analyst  to  examine  each  specific  genetic  attribute  repre-
sented by the 250 features (Fig. 11C) that further confirm 
the hypothesis.

We  also  carried  out  an  analysis  for  different  groups  of 
patients. The experiments also confirm the effectiveness of 
the similarity space. For example, the genetic analysis of four 
clusters of patients (see Fig. 5) has unveiled that all probe 
sets of the gene MKI67 of the patients in cluster 0 (at the 

bottom-left and painted with a light-pink color) are signi-
ficantly  different  from  the  others  (see  Fig.  12).  Further 
visualization with the probe set mapping across the patient’s 
population has confirmed this property (see Fig. 5). Details 
of the other findings (and the confirmation of the prognoses) 
are described further as follows.

1. There is little coherence between the genomic property 
and the biomedical property, such as risk, dead, or survival 
rate. Similar patients in terms of background and clinical 
information  might  have  significant  differences  in  their

Fig. 15. The genetic property of high-risk patients. For the very high-risk patients, the genetic property of patient ALL302 (the only  survivor
at the bottom-right) is significantly different from the others (at the top-left). Further examination using the 250 genes of interest confirms
this  hypothesis  for  the  expression  values,  especially  for  the  genes  ABHD10,  LEPREL1,  CNOT4,  CHD9,  EPOR,  RASAL2,  ZNF141,  and
SLC25A31.

(see Fig. 14). Particularly, there was only one death out of 
19 cases (95% chance of survival from the disease) if the 
treatment was started within 5 years after birth. The dead 
case also happened to a very high-risk patient who was 
unlikely to survive because of the disease. If the treatment 
was started after 5 years but within 10 years from birth, 
the survival rate is 86% (3 deaths out of 22 cases), and if 
the  treatment  was  used  after  10  years  from  birth,  the 
survival rate reduces significantly to 69% (4 deaths out of 
13 cases). 

3.  Among  the  very  high-risk  patients  ALL123,  ALL143, 
ALL144,  and  ALL302  (top-left),  patient  ALL302  (near 
bottom-right)  was  the  only  survivor  whose  genetic 
property was significantly different from the others (at the 
top-left).  Further  examination  using  the  250  GOIs 
illustrated  in  Fig.  15  confirms  this  hypothesis  for  the 
expression  values,  especially  for  the  genes  ABHD10, 

LEPREL1, CNOT4, CHD9, EPOR, RASAL2, ZNF141, and 
SLC25A31. The variation at a particular gene or a combi-
nation of these genes might have contributed to the sur-
vival rate or an improvement in treatment. This finding 
can be verified by further analysis using larger and more 
comprehensive datasets and, ultimately, the actual proof 
of the clinical experiments.

4. Patients who were born in later years have a better chance 
of survival. For example, the rate of survival for those 
patients born after 1995 was approximately 94% while the 
rate  for  those  patients  born  before  1995  was  appro-
ximately 83%. This property reflects the improvement in 
treatment technology, treatment methodology, and living 
conditions.

5. Female patients tend to fare better than male patients 
overall (see Fig. 16). There is a 92.5% chance of survival in 
females (3 dead cases out of 40) versus an 88.3% chance

regardless of risk strategies and age. Fig. 17 shows the 
protocols  used  in  ALL  treatment,  including  Study  8 
(green), BFM 95 (blue), Interfant 99 (orange), and others 
(red).

7.  Chemotherapy  is  more  effective  in  treatment.  It  is 
interesting that nearly one-half of all patients did not have 
any treatments (or there were no treatment records) on 
record. The untreated patients mostly have standard to 
MRs. The bone marrow transplant treatment method has 
little effect  on  the  survival rate (only 1 out  of  5  cases 
survived). The most commonly chosen treatment method 
is chemotherapy, the survival rate for which is over 90% 
(see Fig. 18).
