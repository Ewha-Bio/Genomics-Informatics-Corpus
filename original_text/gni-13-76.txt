Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex metabolic disorder associated with multiple genetic, developmental and environmental 
factors. The recent advances in gene expression microarray technologies as well as network-based analysis methodologies 
provide groundbreaking opportunities to study type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we used previously published 
gene expression microarray datasets of human skeletal muscle samples collected from 20 insulin sensitive individuals before 
and after insulin treatment in order to construct insulin-mediated regulatory network. Based on a motif discovery method 
implemented by iRegulon, a Cytoscape app, we identified 25 candidate regulons, motifs of which were enriched among the 
promoters of 478 up-regulated genes and 82 down-regulated genes. We then looked for a hierarchical network of the 
candidate regulators, in such a way that the conditional combination of their expression changes may explain those of their 
target genes. Using Genomica, a software tool for regulatory network construction, we obtained a hierarchical network of 
eight  regulons  that  were  used  to  map  insulin  downstream  signaling  network.  Taken  together,  the  results  illustrate  the 
benefits  of  combining  completely  different  methods  such  as  motif-based  regulatory  factor  discovery  and  expression 
level-based construction of regulatory network of their target genes in understanding insulin induced biological processes 
and signaling pathways.

Introduction

Insulin resistance is a condition in which tissues, such as 
skeletal  muscle,  liver,  and  adipocytes,  fail  to  respond  to 
insulin, leading to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Because skeletal 
muscle  is  the  primary  tissue  of  insulin-mediated  glucose 
uptake [1], it would be important to study the insulin effects 
on gene expression in skeletal muscle and to identify the 
insulin-responsive target genes and regulatory genes.

DNA  microarray  techniques  have  been  widely  used  in 
biological research by enabling comprehensive understan-
ding  of  molecular  and  systematic  mechanism  [2,  3].  In 
addition,  microarray  experiments  enable  researchers  to 
identify  gene  sets  undergoing  a  response  to  a  specific 

stimulus as well as to analyze dynamic response at the level 
of  gene  regulatory  network  [4].  Especially,  microarray 
experiments could be designed to study downstream effects 
of a specific stimulus or diverse stimuli on gene expression at 
the  level  of  genomic  scale,  not  a  single  genetic  one  [5]. 
Microarray  techniques  could  be  a  power  tool  to  discover 
regulatory  factors  as  most  of  co-expressed  genes  are 
co-regulated by the same regulatory factors [6]. Moreover, 
because genes co-regulated by the same transcription factor 
(TF) commonly share binding sites for this TF [6], it would 
be worth to detect TF based on motif discovery method. 

Although  diverse  motif  discovery  methods  have  been 
proposed and refined [7-10], most of them are restricted to 
using human annotated position weight matrices (PWM). 
On  the  other  hand,  iRegulon,  a  user-friendly  Cytoscape

plugin, provides approximately nine thousand PWMs that 
have been collected from various sources and from different 
species and enable to make regulatory network by linking 
them to candidate TF [11]. The other approach for pathway 
analysis is Genomica [12], which yields regulatory modules 
from  gene  expression  based  on  probabilistic  graphical 
models and Bayesian networks. It has a benefit in directly 
mirroring  expression  of  their  target  genes  in  a  specific 
condition by comparing expressions between regulators and 
their  target  genes  [12].  However,  this  approach  requires 
looping over all regulators, taking too much time in big data. 
Here, we tried to construct a regulatory network in order 
to understand the regulation of insulin-response genes. We 
identified about 560 genes differentially expressed between 
before and after treatment in insulin sensitive individuals, 
and  found  that  those  genes  act  for  insulin  signaling 
biological process through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. 
Furthermore, we report a reliable regulatory network cont-
rolling insulin-mediated genes by integrating motif-based 
approach  using  iRegulon  and  expression-based  approach 
using  Genomica;  thereby  present  some  benefits  for  the 
construction. 

Methods
Study samples

We  downloaded  and  re-analyzed  a  previous  published 
mRNA expression microarray data set measured on Affy-
metrix  Human  Genome  U95A  Array  (Affymetrix,  Santa 
Clara, CA, USA) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) 
database (GSE22309) [5]. This data was measured in human 
skeletal  muscle  cell  of  human  individuals:  20  insulin 
sensitive, 20 insulin resistant, and 15 diabetic patients for 
before and after insulin treatment. We used only the insulin 
sensitive group. Total of 12,626 probes were monitored, and 
we considered genes which are protein-coding gene.

Insulin-mediated genes

To select differential genes before and after insulin treat-
ment  in  20  insulin  sensitive  individuals,  we  carried  out 
paired  t  test  and  calculated  gene  expression  fold  change. 
Using local commands of R program, we selected insulin- 
responsive genes which were significantly dysregulated at 
p-value (paired t test) ＜ 0.01 (corresponding to FDR [13] ≤ 
0.05) and fold change ＞ 1.2 (Fig. 1). We looked for enriched 
GO  terms  of  the  insulin  responsive  genes  using  DAVID 
Functional Annotation Tool [14]. 

Search for candidate TFs based on regulatory motif 
and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing

The regulatory factors for insulin-responsive genes were 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  3,  2015

searched  using  the  iRegulon  app  in  Cytoscapev3.2.1. 
iRegulon  detects  the  TFs  and  their  targets  by  scanning 
known TF-binding promoter motifs as well as the predicted 
motifs discovered from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE) Project chromatin immunoprecipitation-seque-
ncing data. We set 20-kb upstream for the options “Putative 
regulatory region,” “Motif rankings database,” and “Track 
rankings database.” Other options were taken as default. We 
executed iRegulon and looked for TFs for each down and up 
regulated genes.

Construction of regulatory networks based on 
expression value

With  TFs  searched  by  iRegulon,  we  tried  to  construct 
regulatory network modules which can explain situation of 
expressions of target genes based on expression level. This 
construction was carried out using Genomica [12], which is 
an analysis and visualization tool for genomic data. Among 
functions  of  Genomica,  we  used  the  “Create  a  Module 
Network.”  It identifies  regulatory  network  modules  from 
gene  expression  data  based  on  probabilistic  graphical 
models and Bayesian networks. The options “Max number of 
modules” and “Min experiments per context” were set at 4.

Results
Insulin-targeted gene set

The  expression  data  of  20  insulin  sensitive  individuals 
downloaded from GEO (GSE22309) were analyzed to find 
genes controlled by insulin. In addition, the data contain 
expression  values  of  transcripts  before  and  after  insulin 
treatment  for  each  sample.  Among  the  total  of  12,626 
probes, we selected about 9,000 genes which are protein- 
coding gene. With expression of each gene, we carried out 
paired t test between before and after insulin treatment and 
calculated fold change. A total of 560 genes were identified 
by cutoff using t test p-value (padj ＜ 0.05) and fold change 
(FC ＞ 1.2) in insulin sensitive group (Fig. 1). Furthermore, 
we looked for enriched GO terms using DAVID functional 
annotation tool, and several biological process terms of the 
GO database were searched (padj ＜ 0.05). As the resulting 
list of terms is redundant, the lists were prunedmanually 
(Table 1). Most of the terms were compatible with insulin 
response  and  overlapped  to  GO  terms  which  have  been 
known from previous studies [5]. 

TF discovery based on motif using iRegulon

We  tried  to  discover  the  regulatory  TFs  for  the 
insulin-treated gene set using iRegulon in Cytoscape. For 
each down- and up-regulated gene set, we predicted 25 TFs 
of the target genes based on motif in upstream 20 kb of the 
target genes. As shown in Fig. 2, target genes are linked to 
multiple  TFs.  A  single  TF  targeted  about  138  genes  in 
average.

Construction of regulatory network using Genomica

We  tried  to  explain  the  expression  variations  of  target

genes with those of TFs identified by iRegulon. Firstly, we 
checked correlation between expression of YY1, which is a 
predicted TF by iRegulon and known for an insulin signaling 
gene,  and  mean  of  those  of  target  genes.  However,  the 
correlation coefficient is rather low (Fig. 3). This prompted 
us  to  construct  the  TF  network  module  to  explain  the 
expression variations of target genes using Genomica (Fig. 
4). We found most TFs participated in regulatory network 
constructed by Genomica have been known to have relation-

shold of t test p-value and expression fold change, about 560 
genes  among  total  of  12,626  genes  were  identified.  GO 
enrichment analysis indicated that the gene set is enriched 
with  the  biological  process  terms  related  with  insulin 
signaling  pathway.  Especially,  among  those  GO  terms, 
“response  to  hormone  stimulus”  and  “trans  membrane 
receptor  protein  tyrosine  kinase  signaling  pathway”  have 
well known links directly to the insulin [8]. To understand 
regulation of those genes made up of the insulin signaling 
pathway, 25 TFs were predicted by iRegulon, based on the 
enrichment of TF-binding motif. iRegulon can infer TFs of 
target  genes,  and  visualize  interactions  between  TFs  and 
target genes with previously known evidences that what TFs 
bind to a target gene with sequence information. In this case, 
expression values of target genes are not considered, and this 
regulatory  network  cannot  explain  how  those  regulators 

ships  with  insulin  from  previous  studies  [15-19].  While 
iRegulon provides a list of potential regulatory TFs ignorant 
of their expression conditions, Genomica has the power to 
filter the list by constructing conditional hierarchical regul-
atory network where the expression variations of the target 
genes  are  explained  by  the  expression  conditions  of  the 
filtered TFs. We describe a more reliable regulatory network 
controlling insulin-responsive genes by integrating completely 
different methods for constructing regulatory network.

Discussion

Most genes have networks of interactions for appropriate 
biological  functions.  Furthermore,  regulators  do  not  act 
alone.  Describing  a  combination  of  regulatory  genes  is 
important to more accurately explain their target genes and 
understand biological functions. In this regard, construction 
of regulatory networks can give an insight in the biological 
interpretation of differential gene set between normal and 
complex diseases. In order to understand insulin-responsive 
system,  we  tried  to  construct  regulatory  network  with 
microarray  mRNA  expression  data  monitored  before  and 
after insulin treatment in skeletal muscle of insulin sensitive 
samples.  For  the  construction  of  a  reliable  network,  we 
carried out integration of two different methods, one based 
on TF-binding motif and the other on expression variations. 
Firstly,  we  defined  insulin-mediated  gene  set  using  thre-

target  genes  by  insulin  treatment  were  averaged  and  plotted  on 
y-axis,  and  those  of  YY1  were  plotted  on  x-axis.  The  expressions 
of  YY1  do  not  resemble  those  of  their  target  genes  (correlation 

coefficient=−0.5878721).

affect  expression  variation  of  target  genes.  We  tried  to 
explain expression variation of target genes with those of 
TFs  identified  by  iRegulon.  However,  the  expression 
variation of a TF did not resemble those of target genes. It 
suggests that expression variations of multiple TFs should 
be  considered  collectively  to  understand  those  of  target 
genes. With the TFs predicted by iRegulon, we constructed 
a  hierarchical  regulatory  network  among  them  using 
Genomica, explaining the expression variation of the target 
genes.  As  shown  Fig.  4,  a  combination  of  multiple  TFs 
instead of a single TF explained the expression variations of 
target genes. For example, MEF2A which is at the top of the 
regulatory  TF  network  had  the  largest  influence  on  the 
expression  variations  of  the  target  genes,  and  YY1,  the 
second  highest  ranking  TF,  did  not  influence  as  much  as 
MEF2A.  However,  YY1  affects  to  increase  expression  of 
target genes when MEF2A has low expression value. In fact, 
MEF2A,  YY1,  SRF,  PDX1,  and  NFATC4  are  known  for 
having  relationships  with  insulin  [15-19].  Although 
expression of downstream TFs in the regulatory network is 
not  perfectly  fitted  to  that  of  their  target  genes,  the 
construction based on expression data helps to understand 
more clearly regulatory network of target genes. Altogether, 
in  this paper, we  presented  a reliable  regulatory  network 
controlling insulin-mediated genes as well as the approach 
integrating two different methods, iRegulon and Genomica, 
may allow making a reliable regulatory network.
