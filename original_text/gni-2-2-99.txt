Abstract 
In  this. paper  we  introduce  PubMiner,  an  intelligent 
machine  learning  based  text  mining  system  for  mining 
biological 
information  from  the  literature.  PubMiner 
employs  natural  language  processing  techniques  and 
machine  learning  based  data  mining  techniques  for 
mining  useful  biological  information  such  as  protein(cid:173)
protein  interaction  from  the  massive  literature.  The 
system  recognizes  biological  terms  such  as  gene, 
protein,  and  enzymes  and  extracts  their  interactions 
described  in  the  document  through  natural  language 
processing.  The  extracted 
further 
analyzed with a set of features of each entity that were 
collected from the related public databases to infer more 
interactions  from  the  original  interactions.  An  inferred 
interaction  from  the  interaction  analysis  and  native 
interaction  are  provided  to  the  user  with  the  link  of 
literature  sources.  The  performance  of  entity  and 
interaction extraction was tested with selected MEDLINE 
abstracts.  The evaluation of inference proceeded  using 
the  protein  interaction  data  of  S.  cerevisiae  (bakers 
yeast) from MIPS and SGD.

Introduction 
New  scientific  discoveries  are  based  on  the  existing 
knowledge which  has to  be  accessible and thus  usable 
by the scientific community (Andrade eta/., 2000). In the 
19th century, the spread of scientific information was still 
done  by writing  letters with  new discoveries to  a small 
number of colleagues. Printed journals took over this job

professionally.  We  are  currently  on  another  transition 
into  electronic  media.  Electronic  storage  allows  the 
customized  extraction  of information from the literature 
and  its combination  with  other data  resources  such  as 
heterogeneous  databases.  In  fact,  it  is  not  only  an 
opportunity,  but  also  a  pressing  need  as  the  volume  of 
scientific literature is increasing immensely.  Furthermore, 
the  scientific  community  is  growing  so  that  even  for  a 
rather  specialized  field  it  becomes  impossible  to  stay 
up-to-date just through personal contacts in that particular 
community.  The  growing  amount  of  knowledge  also 
increases  the  chance  for  new  ideas  based  on  the 
combination of solutions from different fields.  And there 
is  a necessity of accessing and  integrating all  scientific 
information to be able to judge the own progress and to 
get inspired by new questions and answers. 

information 

Since  the  human  genome  sequences  have  been 
decoded,  especially in  biology and  bioinformatics,  there 
are  more  and  more  people  devoted  to  this  research 
domain and hundreds of on-line databases characterizing 
biological  information  such  as  sequences,  structures, 
molecular interactions, and expression patterns (Chiang 
eta/., 2004 ).  Despite the prevalent topic of research, the 
end result of all biological experiments is a publication in 
the form of text.  However,  information in text form,  such 
as  MEDLINE  (http://www.pubmed.gov/),  is  a  greatly 
underutilized  source  of  biological 
to 
biological  researchers.  Because  it  takes  lots  of time  to 
obtain the  important and  precise information from  huge 
databases  with  daily 
increase.  Thus  knowledge 
discovery from  a  large  collection  of scientific  papers  is 
very  importantfor  efficient  biological  and  biomedical 
research.  Until  now,  a number of tools and  approaches 
have been developed to resolve such needs. There are 
many systems analyzing abstracts in MEDLINE to offer 
bio-related information services. Suiseki (Blaschke eta/., 
1999;  Blaschke  et  a/.,  2002)  and  BioBiblioMetrics 
(Stapley  et  a/.,  2000)  focus  on  the  protein-protein 
interaction  extraction  and  visualization.  MedMiner 
(Tanabe eta/., 1999) utilizes external data sources such 
as  GeneCard  (Safran  et  a/.,  2003)  and  MEDLINE  for 
offering structured information about specific key-words 
provided  by  the  user.  AbXtract  (Andrade  eta/.,  1998) 
labels the protein function in the input text and XplorMed 
(Perez-lratxeta eta/., 2000) presents the user specified 
information  through  the  interaction  with  user.  GENIES 

1 00  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  2(2) 99-106, June 2004 

(Friedman  et  a/.,  2001)  discovers  more  complicated 
information  such  as  pathways  from  journal  abstracts. 
Recently,  MedScan  (Daraselia  et at.,  2004)  employed 
full-sentence  parsing  technique  for  the  extraction  of 
human protein interactions from MEDLINE. 

Generally, these conventional  systems rely on  basic 
natural  language  processing  (NLP)  techniques  when 
analyzing  literature  data.  And  the  efficacy  of  such 
systems heavily depends on the rules for processing raw 
information.  Such  rules  have  to  be  refined  by  human 
experts,  entailing  the  possibility  of  lack  of clarity  and 
coverage.  In  order to  overcome this  problem,  we  used 
machine learning techniques in combination with natural 
language  processing 
techniques  to  analyze  the 
interactions  among  the  biological  entities.  Our method 
also incorporated several data mining techniques for the 
extensive  discovery,  i.e.  detection  of the  interactions 
which are not directly described in the text. 

We  have  developed  PubMiner  (Publication-based 
Text Mining system) which performs efficient interaction 
mining of biological  entities such  as  gene,  protein,  and 
enzymes.  For the performance evaluation,  the  budding 
yeast (S.  cerevisiae) was used as the model organism. 
The  goal  of our  text  mining  system  is  to  design  and 
develop  an 
information  system  that  can  efficiently 
retrieve the biological entity-related information from the 
MEDLINE, where the biological  entity-related information 
includes biological function of entities (e.g., gene, protein, 
and enzymes etc.),  related gene or protein,  and  relation 
of gene or proteins.  Especially we focus on  interactions 
between entities. 

System Description 
PubMiner, a machine learning based text mining platform, 
consist  of  three  key  components:  natural  language 
processing,  machine  learning  based  inference,  and 
visualization module. 

Information Extraction 
The  interaction  extraction  module is  based  on the  NLP 
techniques adapted to take into account the properties of 
biomedical literature. It includes a part-of-speech (POS) 
tagger, a named-entity tagger, a syntactic analyzer, and 
an  event  extractor.  The  POS  tagger  based  on  hidden 
Markov  models  (HMMs)  was  adopted  for  tagging 
biological  words  as  well  as  general  ones.  The  named(cid:173)
entity tagger,  based on support vector machines (SVMs), 
recognizes the region of an  entity and assigns a proper 
class  to  it.  The  syntactic  analyzer  recognizes  base 
phrases  and  detects  the  dependency  represented  in 
them. Finally, the event extractor finds the binary relation 
using  the  syntactic  information  of  a  given  sentence, 
co-occurrence  statistics  between  two  named  entities, 
and  pattern  information  of  an  event  verb.  General 
medical  term  was  trained  with  UMLS  meta-thesaurus 
(Humphreys eta/., 1998) and the biological entity and its 
interaction  was  trained  with  GENIA corpus  (Kim  eta/. 
2003).  And  the  underlying  NLP  approach  for  named 
entity  recognition  is  based  on  the  system  of  Hwang 
(Hwang eta/., 2003) and Lee (Lee eta/., 2003). Figure 1 
shows

Interaction Inference 
The  relation  inference  module,  which  finds  common 
features  and  group  relations,  is  based  on  data  mining 
and  machine  learning  techniques.  A  set  of features  of 
each  component  of the  interaction  are  collected  from 
public  databases  such  as  Saccharomyces  Genome 
Database (SGD) (Christie eta/., 2004) and database of 
Munich 
Information  Center  for  Protein  Sequences 
(MIPS) (Mewes eta/., 2004) and represented as a binary 
feature vector.  An  association  rule  discovery algorithm, 
Apriori  (Agrawal  eta/.,  1993)  was  used  to  extract  the 
appropriate common feature set of interacting biological 
entities. 
In  addition,  a  distribution-based  clustering 
algorithm (Sionim  eta/., 2000) was  adopted  to analyze 
group  relations.  This  clustering  method  collects  group 
relation from the collection  of document which  contains 
various biological entities. And the clustering procedure 
discovers  common  characteristics  among  members  of 
the  same  cluster.  It  also  finds  the  features  describing 
inter-cluster (between clusters) relations.  PubMiner also 
provides graphical interface to select various options for 
the  clustering  and  mining.  Finally,  the  hypothetical 
interactions  are  generated  for  the  c9nstruction  of 
interaction network.  The hypotheses correspond  to the 
inferred generalized association rules and the procedure 
of association  discovery  is  described  in  the  Section  of 
'Methods.'  A  set  of  inferred  relations  as  well  as  the 
relations  from  text  analysis  are  stored  in  the  local 
database in  a systematic way for efficient management 
of  information.  Figure  2  describes 
the  schematic 
architecture of relation  inference module. 

Visualization 
The visualization module shows interactions among the 

biological entities as a network format.  It also shows the 
documents from which the relations were extracted and 
inferred. In addition, diverse additional information, such 
as the weight of association  between  biological  entities 
could  be  represented.  By  this,  the  user  can  easily 
examine the reliability of relations inferred by the system. 
Moreover,  the  visualization  module  shows  interaction 
networks with minimized complexity for comprehensibility 
and  can  be  utilized  as  an  independent  interaction 
network  viewer  with  predefined  input  format.  Figure  3 
shows  the  overall  architecture  of visualization  module 
and  its interface. 

Methods 
Feature Selection 
In our application, each interaction event is represented 
by their feature association.  Thus it is very important to 
select optimal feature subset is important to achieve the 
efficiency  of  system  and  to  eliminate  non-informative 
association 
information.  Therefore,  PubMiner  uses 
feature  dimension  reduction  filter  (FDRF)  to  achieve 
these objectives. 

Each feature of data is considered a random variable 
and the entropy is used as a measure of the uncertainty 
of the  random variable.  The entropy of a variable  X  is 
defined as: 

H(X) = - L;P(xi)log 2(P(x)) 

l 

(0.1) 

And the entropy of  X  after observing values of another 

variable  Y is defined as: 

(0.2)

where  P(y;) is the prior probability of Y;,  and  P(x;IYj) 
is the posterior probability of  X= x; given the values of 
Y =  y j·  The  amount  by  which  the  entropy  of  X 
information  about  X 
decreases  reflects  additional 
provided by  Yand is called information gain (Quinlan et 
a/.,  1993), given by: 

/G(XI Y) =  H(X)- H(XI Y) 

(0.3) 

According to this measure, a feature  Y is considered 
to  be  more  correlated  to  feature  X  than  feature  Z,  if 
IG(XI Y) > IG(ZI Y).  Symmetry is a desired property for 
a  measure  of  correlations  between 
features  and 
information gain.  However, information gain is biased in 
favor of features with more values and the values have to 
be normalized to ensure they are comparable and have 
the  same  affect.  Therefore,  here  we  use  symmetrical 
uncertainty as a measure of feature correlation (Press et 
a/.,  1998), defined as follows: 

SU(X,  Y)-2  H(X)+H(Y)  ,0-SU(X, Y)s:l

With  symmetrical  uncertainty 
association  measure,  we  define 
feature  selection 
procedure which  is similar to the definition of Yu (Yu  et 
a/.,  2003)  to  reduce  the  computational  complexity.  To 
decide  whether  a  feature  is  relevant  to  the  protein 
interaction (interaction class) or not, we use  c-correlation 
and  /-correlation  which  use the  threshold  SU value  B 
decided by user. In the proposed method, the class  Cis 
divided into two class, conditional protein class ( Cc) and 
result protein class ( CR)  of interaction.  Figure 4 shows 
the  overall  procedure  of  informative  feature  selection 

and  the  procedure  is  conducted  for  each  interaction 
class. 

The two feature scoring measures used in the procedure

of  Figure  4,  c-correlation  (SUi,c)  and 
(S[0,i ),  are defined as follows:

fi and the class  C(call as  c-correlation), then the subset  S 
of relevant feature can be decided by a threshold  suvalue 
B,  such

decide  whether  relevant  feature  is  redundant  or  not 
when considering it with other relevant features.

Mining Feature Association 
To  predict  implicit  interaction  between  entities  with 
feature  association,  we  use  conventional  data  mining 
method.  For this,  we  adopt  association  rule  discovery 
algorithm  (so-called  Apriori  algorithm)  proposed  by 
Agrawal  (Agrawal  eta/.,  1993).  Generally,  association 
rule  R(A~B) has two values,  support and confidence, 
representing  the characteristics of the association  rule. 
Support (SP) represents the frequency of co-occurrence 
of all  the  items  appearing  in  the  rule.  And  confidence 
( CF)  represents  the accuracy of the  rule  computed  by 
dividing the support value by frequency of co-occurrence 
conditional  part items of the rule.  These are defined as

follows: 

SP(A=?B) =  P(AUB), CF(A=?B) =  P(BIA) 

(0.5) 

where  A=? B  represents  association  rule,  A  and  B 
represent items (set of features) in that order. Association 
rule can be discovered by detecting all the possible rules 
whose  supports  and  confidences  are  larger  than  the 
user-defined  threshold  values  called  minimal  support 
(SF min)  and  minimal  confidence  ( CFmin)  respectively. 
Rules that  satisfy  both  minimum support and  minimum 
confidence threshold are called strong.  Here we consider 
this strong association rules as interesting ones. 

An  interaction is represented as a pair of two entities 
that directly binds to each other. To analyze interaction of 
entities  with  feature  association,  we  consider  each 
interacting  entity  pair  as  transaction  of  mining  data. 
These transactions with binary vector representation are 

described  in  Figure  5.  Then  we  extract  associative 
features  generally  representing  the  interaction  with 
association rule mining.

Performance of Entity Extraction 
In  order  to  test  our  entity  recognition  and  interaction 
extraction  module,  we  built  a  corpus  from  1,000 
randomly  selected  scientific  abstracts  from  PubMed 
identified 
to  contain  biological  entity  names  and 
interactions  via  manual  searches.  The  corpus  was 
manually analyzed for biological entities such as protein, 
gene,  and  small  molecule  names  in  addition  to  any 
interaction  relationships present in  each  abstract within 
the corpus by biologist in our laboratory. Analysis of the 
corpus  revealed  5,928  distinct  references  to  biological

To test the performance of inference of PubMiner through 
feature  selection  (reductions),  we  used  proteinprotein 
interaction  as  a  metric  of  entity  recognition  and 
interaction  extraction.  The  major  protein  pairs  of  the 
interactions are obtained from the same data source of 
Oyama (Oyama eta/., 2002). It includes MIPS, YPD and 
Y2H by Ito eta/. and Uetz eta/., respectively (Mewes et 
a/.,  2004).  Additionally,  we  also  used  SGD  (Christie  et 
a/.,  2004)  to  collect  more  plentiful  feature  set.  Table  3 
shows  the  statistics  of interaction  data  for  each  data

Discussion 

techniques,  and  visualizes 

Here,  we  presented  a  biomedical  text  mining  system, 
PubMiner,  which  screens  the  interaction  data  from 
literature  abstracts  through  natural  language  analysis, 
performs  inferences  based  on  machine  learning  and 
data  mining 
interaction 
networks with  appropriate  links to the  evidence  article. 
To reveal  more comprehensive  interaction  information, 
we employed both the data mining approach with optimal 
feature selection method in  addition to the conventional 
natural  language processing techniques.  The proposed 
method achieved the improvement of both accuracy and 
processing time. 

Table 4  gives the advantage of obtained  by filtering 
non-informative (redundant) features  and  the  inference 
performance  of PubMiner.  The  accuracy of interaction 
prediction  increased  about  3.4%  with  FDRF.  And  the 
elapsed time of FDRF based association mining, 143.27 
sec, include the FDRF processing time which was 19.89 
sec. The elapsed time decrease obtained by using FDRF 
is about 32.5%. Thus, it is of great importance to reduce 
number of feature of interaction data for the improvement 
of both accuracy and execution performance.  Thus,  we 
can  guess  that  the  information  theory  based  feature 
filtering  reduced a set of misleding or redundnt features 
of interaction data and this feature reduction eleminated 
wrong  associations  and  boosted  the  pocessing  time. 
And the feature association shows the promising results 
for inferencing implicit interaction of biological entities. 

From the  result of Table 4,  it is also suggested  that 

with  smaller  granularity  of interaction  (i.e.,  not  protein, 
but a set of features of proteins) we could achieve further 
detailed  investigation  of  the  proteinprotein  interaction. 
Thus  we  cansay  that  the  proposed  method 
is  a 
somewhat suitable approach for an efficient analysis of 
interactive  entity  pair  which  has  many  features  as  a 
back-end module of the generalliterature mining and for 
the  experimentally  produced 
interaction  data  with 
moderate false positive ratios. 

However, current public interaction data produced by 
such as high-throughput methods (e.g. Y2H) have many 
false  positives.  And  several  interactions  of these false 
positives  are  corrected  by  recent  researches  through 
reinvestigation  with  new  experimental  approaches. 
Thus,  study  on  the  new  method  for  resolving  these 
problems  related  to  false  positive  screening  further 
remain as future works.
