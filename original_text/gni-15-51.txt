High-throughput transcriptome sequencing, also known as RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), is a standard technology for mea-
suring  gene  expression  with  unprecedented  accuracy.  Numerous  bioconductor  packages  have  been  developed  for  the 
statistical analysis of RNA-Seq data. However, these tools focus on specific aspects of the data analysis pipeline, and are 
difficult to appropriately integrate with one another due to their disparate data structures and processing methods. They also 
lack visualization methods to confirm the integrity of the data and the process. In this paper, we propose an R-based RNA-Seq 
analysis  pipeline  called  TRAPR,  an  integrated  tool  that  facilitates  the  statistical  analysis  and  visualization  of  RNA-Seq 
expression data. TRAPR provides various functions for data management, the filtering of low-quality data, normalization, 
transformation, statistical analysis, data visualization, and result visualization that allow researchers to build customized 
analysis pipelines.

Keywords:  base  sequence,  gene  expression  profiling,  molecular  sequence  data,  programming  languages,  sequence 

analysis/RNA, software 

Availability: TRAPR is written in R (the version 2.15), and is available at http://www.snubi.org/software/trapr.

Introduction

High-throughput  mRNA  sequencing  technology  has 
developed at great pace in recent years [1]. Data from RNA 
sequencing  (RNA-Seq)  experiments  across  many  species 
and tissue types are available for free access through public 
repositories.  While  RNA-Seq  data  have  a  wide  range  of 
applications,  such  as  alternative  splicing  research,  fusion 
gene  finding,  novel  transcript  discovery,  etc.,  the  most 
important and widely considered application is the quantifi-
cation  of  gene  expression  profiles  and  the  assessment  of 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) [2]. 

Evaluating  differential  expression  in  conditions  by 
RNA-Seq is a multi-step process [3]. R/bioconductor [4] 
has been used to develop tools for the statistical analysis of 
RNA-Seq data. Some packages stem from classical methods 
for  microarray  data  analysis,  like  the  t  test.  Others,  like 

edgeR [5], DESeq [6], DEGSeq [7], and baySeq [8], have 
recently been developed to the characteristics of RNA-Seq 
data. However, different packages partially support varying 
steps of the multi-step process in a very inconsistent manner. 
Moreover,  no  R  packages  support  data  filtering  steps  to 
improve the statistical power and control outliers that might 
have an undesirable influence on further analysis [9]. 

This  study  proposes  TRAPR  (Total  RNA-Seq  Analysis 
Package  for  R,  http://www.snubi.org/software/trapr),  an 
integrated  pipeline  for  the  analysis  of  RNA-Seq  gene 
expression  data.  TRAPR  uses  gene  expression  tables  to 
perform all RNA-Seq analyses, including data preprocessing, 
filtering,  normalization,  and  statistical  tests.  TRAPR  also 
provides  visualization  functions  for  data  exploration  and 
results’ summarization. TRAPR provides a unique way of 
combining state-of-the-art analysis methods in an integrated 
pipeline  for  comprehensive  RNA-Seq  data  analysis.  For 
instance, upper-quartile normalization followed by zero-value

filtering, variance stabilizing normalization (VSN) [10], and 
edgeR statistical testing with proper data visualization can 
easily be streamlined. These combinations have considerable 
potential to improve the accuracy and statistical power [11] 
of the analysis of RNA-Seq gene expression data.

Results

Fig. 1 shows the five  steps of TRAPR, i.e., data mani-
pulation, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, preprocessing 
result visualization, and statistical result visualization.

Data manipulation

TRAPR  provides  two  functions  to  import  RNA-Seq 
experimental data and four functions to export results to 
files. TRAPR can read text files for expression data as well as 
for a list of genes. During or following analysis, users can 
export DEG lists or detailed tables for DEG and expression 
tables, which other tools can utilize.

Data preprocessing

TRAPR  provides  three  types  of  data  preprocessing 

methods:  filtering,  transformation,  and  normalization. 
TRAPR filtering has six filter types: sample, gene, zero value, 
low  variance,  low  expression,  and  gene  list.  Unlike  DNA 
microarrays that have a fixed number of probes, RNA-Seq 
explores massive amounts of isoforms and novel transcripts 
mixed  with  noise,  such  that  it  returns  many  zeros  and 
nonsense  values.  Genes  encoding  miRNAs  or  snoRNAs 
often show extremely high expression levels, even though 
they are treated by a poly-A purification procedure. These 
outliers can easily be removed by zero-value and gene filters. 
Statistical  power  can  be  improved  by  low-expression  and 
low-variance filters by reducing non-standard distributions. 
Analyzing  different  combinations  of  samples  can  conve-
niently be supported by sample filtering.

TRAPR  provides  two  well-known  transformation  func-
tions, log2 transformation and VSN, followed by hyperbolic 
arcsin,  arcsin(x),  and  transformation  [11]  to  standardize 
data  distribution  and  normalize  variance  distribution, 
respectively. 

TRAPR provides many normalization methods, including 
upper quantile [12], quantile, mean, and median normaliza-
tions. One can conveniently compare the effect of applying

different methods with the following statistical testing and 
visualization functions. 

a platform to interweave RNA-Seq data analysis tools and 
packages to take advantage of the virtues of each.

Statistical testing

TRAPR has several statistical testing functions to identify 
DEGs. Student t-test and statistical methods suggested in 
edgeR, baySeq, and DESeq assume a normal distribution or 
a Poisson distribution. Meanwhile, methods in DEGseq and 
NOISeq [12] do not need to make any assumption. For now, 
there  is  no  correct  answer  that  fits  the  characteristics  of 
RNA-Seq data, and each method has its own merits. TRAPR 
allows users to choose their own methods to build custo-
mized analysis pipelines. The t test is recommended for large 
datasets, whereas edgeR and simple-fold change work for 
datasets  with  a  small  number  of  samples.  DEGs  can  be 
labeled and saved as files containing lists of gene names with 
detailed information.

Visualization

Data  preprocessing steps  are  not  supported by  visuali-
zation  functions  in  previously  developed  packages,  while 
proper visualization is essential and powerful for evaluating 
the quality of the RNA-Seq data and the preprocessing steps. 
TRAPR provides five flexible plotting functions, including 
density,  boxplot,  MA,  scatter,  and  mean–variance  plots. 
Volcano plots and heatmaps are also provided to visualize 
the results of statistical analysis. Each visualization function 
has direct access to FPKM values and differential expression 
values.

Discussion

We have developed TRAPR, an R package for RNA-Seq 
data  analysis.  TRAPR  provides  an  entire  pipeline  for 
RNA-Seq  analysis,  which  is  not  merely  a  combination  of 
currently available tools, but the backbone that facilitates 
the proper application and coordination of these tools. For 
instance, upper-quartile normalization followed by zero-value 
filtering, VSN, and edgeR statistical testing with proper data 
visualization  can  easily  be  streamlined  through  TRAPR. 
These  combinations  will  help  improve  accuracy  and  sta-
tistical power. TRAPR provides visualization tools and file 
I/O functions to evaluate the quality and characteristics of 
the data. TRAPR was developed and integrated in R, such 
that it can be easily applied to other technologies like Serial 
Analysis of Gene Expression and microarray. Various filters 
have been integrated into the package. TRAPR can be used as
