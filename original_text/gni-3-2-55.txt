Abstract 
Peroxiredoxins (Prx's) are a superfamily of peroxidases 
that  are  ubiquitous  in  all  super-kingdoms.  Previous 
biochemical and structural studies have suggested that 
Prx's  could  be  divided  into  five  subfamilies  (1-Cys, 
Typicai2-Cys, Atypicai2-Gys C-, L-and R- types).  In this 
work,  we  have  developed  a  set  of  regular  expression 
patterns describing subfamily-specific spatial constraints 
of the key catalytic residues. Using these patterns, 1 ,016 
Prx's available  in  public databases were classified  into 
the five subfamilies. Our method performed well for most 
of the types except for Atypical 2 Cys R type.

Introduction 
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the superoxide 
anion radical (02'-), hydrogen peroxide (H202) and the 
hydroxyl radical (HO' ), are intermediately formed during 
the univalent reduction of oxygen to water, and are also 
produced  during  j3-oxidation  of  fatty  acids  and  upon 
exposure 
redox  drugs 
(Nordberg  and  Arner,  2001 ).  H202  itself  is  not  very 
reactive,  but  can  be  further  reduced  to  the  extremely 
reactive  HO' .  ROS  can  cause  molecular  damage  to 
various cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and 
nucleic  acids,  leading  to  cell  death,  and  were  thus 
considered  to  be  highly  toxic  byproducts  of  oxygen 
metabolism and of no useful  biological significance. To 
the  damaging  effects  of  ROS,  aerobic

organisms evolved  both  non-enzymatic and  enzymatic 
antioxidant  defenses 
(Ahmad,  1995).  Enzymatic 
defenses include superoxide dismutases which convert 
0 2'- to H202,  and catalases, gluthathione peroxidases 
and peroxiredoxins which convert H202 to H20.  Recent 
findings show that, in addition to its deleterious effects, 
H202  is  produced  transiently 
the 
activation of many cell surface receptors and serves as a 
ubiquitous 
intracellular  messenger  at  sub-toxic 
concentrations (Rhee eta/., 2005). 
(Prx's)  are  a 

family  of 
antioxidant  enzymes  which  are  abundant,  in  several 
isoforms,  in  yeast,  plant,  and  animal  cells and  in  most 
eubacteria and archaea (Chae  eta/., 1994; Rhee et al., 
2001;  Hofmann  et al.,  2002).  Prx's  reduce  deleterious 
H20 2 or alkyl hydroperoxides utilizing the thiol group of a 
cysteine residue (Wood eta/., 2003b), and in some cases 
are  involved  in  the  decomposition  of  highly  toxic 
peroxynitrite  (Bryk  eta/.,  2000).  Some  Prx's  also  play 
significant roles in receptor signaling as, after completion 
of  its mission as  an  intracellular messenger,  the timely 
elimination of H202 is critical (Wood eta/., 2003a; Rhee et 
a/.,  2005). 

large 

All  Prx's,  belonging  to  the  thioredoxin-fold  super(cid:173)

family, contain a conserved 'peroxidatic' Cys (Cp)  in the 
N-terminal portion and share the same peroxidatic active 
-site  structure  (Wood  et al.,  2003b).  The  Cp  residue  is 
oxidized  by  peroxides  to  a  cysteine  sulfenic  acid  (Cp(cid:173)
SOH) intermediate. Prx's are classified into either the 2-
Cys  or  1-Gys  types,  based  on  the  occurrence  of  the 
'resolving' Cys (CR)  (Rhee eta/., 2001;  Hofmann  eta/., 
2002).  In 2-Cys Prx's, the Cp-SOH and CR-SH  react and 
form a disulfide (Cp-8-S-CR).  The stable disulfide form is 
then  reduced  by  one  of  several  cell-specific  disulfide 
oxidoreductases  (e.g.,  thioredoxin  (Trx),  tryparedoxin, 
AhpD, or AhpF), completing the catalytic cycle.  In 1-Cys 
recycled  via 
Prx's, 
oxidoreductases  such  as  Trx and  glutaredoxin.  The 2-
Cys  Prx's  have  been  subdivided  into  either 'typical'  or 
'atypical'  types  depending  on  the  location  of  the  CR 
residue.  In  typical  2-Cys  Prx's, the Cp-SOH  reacts with 
the  CR  residue  located  in  the  C-terminal  arm  from  the 
other subunit.  In contrast,  the CR  residue  in  atypical 2-
Cys  Prx's  resides  within  the  same  subunit.  As  the 
atypical  2-Cys  Prx's have  been further subdivided  into 
'L',  'C',  or 'R'  type  subfamilies,  also depending  on  the

classification  of all  known  Prx's  at this  fine  scale  may 
provide further insights into the biochemical mechanism 
and protein evolution of this important protein family. 

Biochemical  functions  of  a  protein  are  typically 
predicted from  its sequence similarity to those proteins 
whose  functions  or  3D  structures  have  been  experi(cid:173)
mentally determined.  The first  line of sequence search 
method  is  using  the  pair-wise  sequence  similarity 
algorithms  such  as  BLAST  (Altschul  et a/.,  1997)  and 
FAST A (Pearson, 1994). Such methods are appropriate 
for detecting sequences of relatively high homology, but 
are  not  efficient  in  detecting  distant  members  of  a 
divergent protein family such as Prx's. The sensitivity of 
sequence search methods has been improved by profile 
-or motif-based analysis, which uses information derived 
from  multiple  sequence  alignments  to  construct  and 
search for sequence patterns. Unlike pairwise sequence 
similarity  methods,  the  latter  can  exploit  additional 
information, such as the position and identity of residues 
that  are  conserved  throughout  the  family,  as  well  as 
variable insertion and deletion probabilities. The hidden 
Markov model  is  one appropriate method to express a 
profile  or  motif  because  it  provides  a  solid  statistical 
foundation 
from  a  multiple 
sequence  alignment  (Eddy,  1998).  While  profile  and 
hidden Markov model methods perform appropriately in 
detecting  homologous  proteins,  these  generally  afford 
only a very high level of functional classification. Most of 
the protein  family databases based  on  profile,  motif or 
domain, such as Pfam (Bateman eta/., 2000), PROSITE 
(Hofmann eta/., 1999), BLOCKS (Henikoff eta/., 1999), 
PRINTS (Attwood eta/., 2000) and lnterPRO (Apweiler 
et a/.,  2000),  have  superfamily of the  Prx's.  But  these 
databases  do  not  include  the  classification  of  Prx's 
subfamily.  We  have  classified  Prx's  to  distinguish 
between  subfamilies  within  a  structurally  and 
functionally diverse superfamily. This work represents the 
classification  tool  and  method  focused  on  a  specific 

information 

to  model 

protein superfamily,  Prx's. 

Methods 
Collecting the sequences of peroxiredoxin family 
from domain and motif databases 
Various  protein  superfamily  databases  are  publicly 
available  in  the  internet.  We  queried  the  following 
databases with a keyword 'peroxiredoxin': Pfam, PROSITE, 
lnterPro  and  BLOCKS.  The  resulting  superfamily  had 
annotations  such  as  TSA  (thiol-specific  antioxidant), 
AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), Tpx (thioredoxin 
peroxidase)  and  peroxiredoxin.  The  protein  entries 
belonging  to these  families  were  downloaded  and  the 
redundant  entries  were  removed.  Summary  of  the 
collected sequences used in this analysis is provided in 
Table 1. 

Compilation of the relevant PDB entries 
We  retrieved  entries  from  PDB  (Berman  eta/.,  2000, 
release  May  31,  2005)  by  querying  a  keyword 
"peroxiredoxin",  resulting  25  hits.  From  the  manual 
inspection  of  the  description  field,  21  structures  were 
identified as the true members of Prx's family (Table 2). 
These entries were classified into 4 subfamilies of Prx's, 
except  Atypical  2  Cys  C  Type  for  which  no  crystal 
structure has been reported yet. 

Defining regular expression 
A regular expression  (abbreviated as  regexp,  regex or 
regxp)  is  a  string  that  describes  or matches  a  set  of 
strings,  according  to  certain  syntax  rules.  Regular 
expressions are used by many text editors and utilities to 
search and manipulate bodies of text based on  certain 
patterns  (Stubbletine,  2003;  Fridl,  1997).  The  protein 
motifs can be represented as  regular expressions. And 
the  structural  properties of  motif can  be formulated  by 
regular  expression.  The  advantages  of  using  regular 
expressions  are  1) 
to

There are several key amino acid residues that have

several  residues  upstream of the peroxidatic Cys  (Cp), 
while an  Arg  (R)  in C-terminal  neutralizes the negative

Classification of Peroxiredoxin Subfamilie  57 

supported by the strong conservation of sequences and 
structures  (Choi  et  a/.,  2003).  Prx's  family  can  be 
classified by the existence and location of resolving Cys 
(CR)  that form S-S  bond with the peroxidatic Cys (Cp). 
Sequence patterns of CP and CR were learned from the 
21  PDB entries. We superposed the protein structures of 
Prx's family with Deep-Viewer (Guex and Peitsch, 1997) 
and the subsequent visual inspection located the critical 
P, CP, Cp and R on sequences. See Fig. 1 for schematic 
diagram of key residues.  The minimum and  maximum 
number  of  intervening  amino  acids  residues  were 
calculated  from  these  sequences  and  converted  into 
regex  forms.  These  forms  were  further  modified  by 
allowing potential insertions and deletions. For example, 
atypical 2 Cys C type of peroxiredoxin could be defined 
by the pattern "P .{6} CP .{4} CR .{60,90} R".  This regular 
expression  is translated  as:  (Pro)  - (6  any  residues) 
(between 60 and 90 of 
(Cys) 
(Arg).  Details  of  pattern  used  in 
any  residues)

for matching the regular expressions with the amino acid

Results 
Classification using regular expression 
A set of Prx's family was converted into FAST A format file 
(a  total  of  1,085  sequences).  Some  sequences  were 
excluded from the set, based on following criteria: (1) The 
sequences whose amino acid length was too short (100 
AA)  or  too  long  (300  AA)  were  removed,  as  Prx's 
molecular weight typically ranges  between 20 - 30kD. 
(2)  The  sequences  where  the  pattern  "P.{6}C"  was 
located within 25 AA from the N-terminus was removed,

important  secondary  structure 
as 
elements  characteristic to  Prx's.  The  final  set  of  Prx's 
includes 1 ,016 entries, with which we ran the search for 
classification  of  Prx's  by  using  the  defined  regular 
expressions. Since the regex for Atypical 2 Cys L type is 
inclusive of and less restrictive than that of Typical2 Cys, 
we gave higher priority to Typical 2 Cys. Classification of 
1 Cys  is difficult due to the  lack of  resolving  Cys  (CR). 
Accordingly,  we  assigned  those  without  any  other 
matches than the basic Prx's pattern to 1 Cys. See Fig. 2

Validation of the classification 
In  order  to  validate  our  classification  result,  we  per(cid:173)
formed  multiple  sequence  alignments  (MSA)  of  each 
resulting  cluster.  For  this,  we  used  the  ClustaiW 
program with default settings (Higgins et at.,  1994). The 
key  catalytic  residues  (P,  Cp,  CP  and  R)  and  all  the 
secondary  structure  elements  were  aligned  extremely 
well.  Compared to the alignment provided by Pfam that 
included all  potential  Prx's in  a single  MSA output,  our 
subfamily-specific  MSA  provided  much  improved  and 
well  defined  alignments  (see  the  supplementary  web 
site for details), demonstrating the validity of our classifi(cid:173)
cation scheme.  Some of the sequences matched more 
than  one 
regex  patterns.  For  example,  Uniprot 
accession  096763,  known  as  a  member  of Typical  2 
Cys on the structural basis (PDB ID 1 UUL ), matched the 
regex pattern of either Atypical 2 Cys C type or Typical 2 
Cys.  For  these  ambiguous  sequences,  we  confirmed 
their  true  membership  by  manual  inspection  of  the 
subfamily-specific  MSA  output.  For  example,  096763 
was  well  absorbed  in  the  MSA  of  Typical  2  Cys 
sequences,  while  it  became  an  outlier  in  the  MSA  of 
Atypical 2 Cys L type sequences.  In this way,  we were 
able to  unambiguously confirm the true membership of 
all the previously ambiguous sequences (Table 5).  The 
error  rates  of  the  regex-based  classification  were then 
7/140,  1/142, 7/51, and 1/414 for Atypical2 Cys C,  L,  R 
and  Typical  2  Cys  types,  respectively.  Our  simple 
method performed extremely well  for most of the types 
except  for  Atypical  2  Cys  R type.  It  appears  that  the 
regex for the latter is subtle and prone to include false 
positives.  We  may  need  more  key  residues  yet  to  be 
discovered  based  on  the  reaction  mechanism  of  the 
enzyme.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  multiple 
sequence alignments  hinted the potential  of even  finer 
sub-classification.

Discussion 
Peroxiredoxins  form  such  a divergent family with  over 
1 ,000  sequences  in  the  public  sequence  databases, 
occurring  in  from  prokaryotes  to  mammals.  Current 
protein domain or family databases list them as a single 
large  family  and  thus  are  not  much  informative  in 
understanding  detailed  molecular  mechanism  of  this 
biologically important class of proteins. It should also be 
noted that these databases except for PROSITE contain 
contaminations,  that  is,  classifying  some  non-Prx's  as 
Prx's. For example, Q8RB02, belonging to thioredoxins, 
do not share the  key catalytic  residues  but  it  shares a 
noticeable  global  sequence similarity with  some  Prx's. 
This is not at all surprising considering that Prx's belong 
to  the  Trx  structural 
fold,  demonstrating  the  risk 
associated with profile-based methods, albeit significant 
advantages.  We  employed  PROSITE-Iike  sequence 
patterns, which may be too simple to sub-classify such a 
large and diverse family. We successfully augmented its 
weakness by meticulous choice of patterns based on the 
Prx's  reaction  mechanism  as  well  as  their  structural 
characteristics  and  by  hierarchical  classification  of 

subfamilies.  However,  our method showed some small 
but  non-negligible  mis-classifications.  Future  improve(cid:173)
ment may require even more key catalytic residues to be 
included  in  the  regex  patterns.  Alternatively,  judicious 
use  of  multiple  sequence  alignments  combined  with 
profile-based  models  may  be  applied  to  our  pattern(cid:173)
based  subfamilies.  Besides  improving the  accuracy  of 
sub-classification,  identifying  even  finer  sub-classes 
should  be  also  important  as  it  may  shed  light  on 
understanding  the  detailed  biochemical  mechanism. 
Accurate classification of a protein family is also critical 
in  constructing  molecular  phylogeny  and 
thus 
understanding evolution of Prx's.
