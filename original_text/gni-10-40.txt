Abstract

Recent  genomewide  association  studies  of  large  sam-
ples  have  identified  genes  that  are  associated  with 
blood  pressure.  The  Global  Blood  Pressure  Genetics 
(Global  BPgen)  and  Cohorts  for  Heart  and  Aging  Re-
search  in  Genome  Epidemiology  (CHARGE)  consortiums 
identified  14  loci  that  govern  blood  pressure  on  a  ge-
nomewide  significance  level,  one  of  which  is  CASZ1 
confirmed  in  both  Europeans  and  Asians.  CASZ1 is  a 
zinc  finger  transcription  factor  that  controls  apoptosis 
and  cell  fate  and  suppresses  neuroblastoma  tumor 
growth  by  reprogramming  gene  expression,  like  a  tumor 
suppressor.  To  validate  the  function  of CASZ1  in  blood 
pressure,  we  decreased Casz1  mRNA  levels  in  mice  by 
siRNA.  Casz1 siRNA  reduced  mRNA  levels  by  59%  in 
a  mouse  cell  line.  A  polyethylenimine-mixed  siRNA  com-
plex  was  injected  into  mouse  tail  veins,  reducing Casz1 
mRNA  expression  to  45%  in  the  kidney.  However,  blood 
pressure  in  the  treated  mice  was  unaffected,  despite  a 
55%  reduction  in Casz1  mRNA  levels  in  the  kidney  on 
multiple  siRNA  injections  daily.  Even  though  Casz1 
siRNA-treated  mice  did  not  experience  any  significant 
change  in  blood  pressure,  our  study  demonstrates  the 
value  of in vivo  siRNA  injection  in  analyzing  the  function 
of  candidate  genes  identified  by  genomewide  associa-
tion  studies.

Introduction

CASZ1  gene  is  a  zinc  finger  transcription  factor  that 
controls  cell  fate,  although  little  is  known  about  its  func-
tion  [1]. CASZ1  is  also  known  as  a  survival-related  gene   
that  has  2  isoforms.  It  encodes  a  putative  protein  of  172

amino  acids  that  localizes  predominantly  in  the  peri-
nuclear  region,  as  predicted  for  transcription  factors. 
CASZ1  is  highly  expressed  in  many  human  cancer  cell 
lines,  although  its  expression  is  low  in  most  tissues,  im-
plicating  it  in  tumor  growth  [2].
    These  findings  indicate  that  CASZ1  is  important  for 
cell  proliferation,  development,  and  differentiation,  as 
well  as  carcinogenesis.  However, CASZ1  has  recently 
been  reported  to  be  significantly  associated  with  blood 
pressure  and  hypertension  in  genomewide  association 
studies  (GWASs)  [3].  Blood  pressure  GWASs  by  the 
Global  Blood  Pressure  Genetics  (Global  BPgen)  [4]  and 
the  Cohorts  for  Heart  and  Aging  Research  in  Genome 
Epidemiology  (CHARGE)  consortium  [5]  have  identified 
14  independent  loci  that  govern  blood  pressure  or  hy-
pertension  at  a  genomewide  significance  level,  7  of 
which  were  replicated 
in  the  Japanese  population 
(CASZ1,  MTHFR,  ITGA9,  FGF5,  CYP17A1-CNNM2, 
ATP2B1, and CSK-ULK3)  [6]. 
rs880315, 
    Single  nucleotide  polymorphism 
which  lies  in  an  intron  of CASZ1,  was  one  of  the  7  repli-
cate  loci  (p  =  2.2  ×  10-8,  p  =  4.9  ×  10-12,  and  p  =  3.0 
×  10-7  for  systolic  blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood  pres-
sure,  and  hypertension,  respectively).  CASZ1  was  also 
linked  to  blood  pressure  in  the  Women’s  Genome 
Health  Study  (rs880315;  p  =  5.2  ×  10-9  for  systolic 
blood  pressure)  [7].  Recently,  the  CASZ1  locus  was 
identified  in  19,608  subjects  of  east  Asian  ancestry  by 
the  Asian  Genetic  Epidemiology  Network  Blood  Pressure 
(AGEN-BP)  consortium  [8].
    Although  these  blood  pressure  GWASs  have  sug-
gested  that  these  loci  control  blood  pressure,  their  func-
tion  in  blood  pressure  has  not  been  examined.  Tradi-
tionally,  knockout  or  transgenic  mice  have  been  used  to 
reveal  gene  function  and  can  be  good  approaches  for 
examining  candidate  genes  that  lie  near  the  GWAS  loci 
[9].  However,  this  process  is  expensive  and  time-con-
suming  [10],  requiring  technical  advances  to  determine 
their  function  in vivo.
    Small  interfering  RNA  (siRNA)  is  an  alternative  ap-
proach  that  has  the  potential  to  become  the  preferred 
tool  for  that  purpose  [11]. In vivo  injection  of  siRNA  re-
duces  gene  expression  by  70%  to  80%  in  certain  tis-
sues  in  mice,  demonstrating  its  efficacy  [12].
    However,  specific  tissues  can  not  be  targeted  by  in 
vivo  injection  of  siRNA,  and  the  injected  siRNA  is  un-
stable  in  blood  serum,  limiting  their  use  in  delivering 
siRNA  in vivo.  It  also  has  certain  disadvantages,  such 

as  effecting  inflammatory  responses  and  toxicity  [13]. 
Thus,  developing  siRNA  delivery  methods  in  animal 
models  is  a  challenging  but  worthy  effort  to  accelerate 
the  discovery  of  novel  genes  [11]. 
    We  sought  to  determine  whether  murine  Casz1  con-
trols  blood  pressure  by  administering  Casz1  siRNA  to 
mice.  A  polyethylenimine-mixed  siRNA  complex  was  in-
jected  into  tail  veins,  and  changes  in Casz1  mRNA  and 
blood  pressure  were  measured.

Methods

Animals

BALB/c  mice  (Japan  SLC,  Inc.,  Shizuoka,  Japan)  were 
bred  in  a  pathogen-free  facility  and  used  at  7  to  9 
weeks  of  age  for  siRNA  injection.  The  mice  were  main-
tained  on  a  12-h  light/dark  cycle  at  a  constant  temper-
ature  with  free  access  to  food  and  water.  Every  effort 
was  made  to  minimize  the  number  of  animals  that  was 
used  and  their  suffering  per  the  Committee  for  the  Care 
and  Use  of  Laboratory  Animals,  College  of  Pharmacy, 
Kyung  Hee  University  (KHP-2010-04-06). 

Synthesis  of  siRNA

Casz1  siRNA  oligonucleotides  were  synthesized  by  Ge-
nolution  (Seoul,  Korea).  The  target  sequence  for  Casz1 
was  5'-GATGTGATCCGACATTACA-3' 
(siRNA#1),  5'- 
CTAGAACTGCTCTGTATGT-3'  (siRNA#2),  and  5'-CAA-
TTCGGCAAGTAATGGA-3'  (siRNA  #3),  and  nonspecific 
scrambled  siRNA  was  used  as  a  negative  control.
    To  examine  the  efficacy  of  siRNAs,  siRNAs  were  tran-
sfected  into  B16F10  cells  using  G-Fectin  (Genolution); 
1-2μL  of  G-Fectin  and  20  nM  siRNA  were  added  to  50 
μL  phosphate  buffered  saline,  and  the  reaction  was  in-
cubated  for  10  min  at  room  temperature  (RT).  B16F10 
cells  were  used  to  seed  24-well  plates  at  5  ×  104 
cells/well  and  30%  confluence,  and  the  transfection 
mixture  was  added  to  the  plate.  The  cells  were  har-
vested  for  RNA  extraction  after  24  h  of  incubation.  Total 
RNA  was  prepared  using  TRIzol  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad, 
CA,  USA)  per  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.

Delivery  methods
The  transfection  agent  was  in vivo-jetPEITM  (Polyplus, 
Illkirch-Graffenstaden,  France).  Per  the  manufacturer,  25 
μg  siRNA  and  6.5μL vivo-jetPEITM  (N/P  charge  ratio  of 
6)  were  diluted  with  50μL  10%  glucose  solution  and  50 
μL  sterile  H2O.  The  solution  was  vortexed  gently  and 
left  for  15  min  at  RT.  The  mixture  was  injected  into  the 
tail  veins  of  7-  to  9-week-old  mice,  and  the  treated  mice

were  measured  for  blood  pressure  or  sacrificed  for  RNA 
extraction.

RNA  extraction  and  real-time  PCR

RNA  was  extracted  from  the  tissues  of  siRNA-treated 
mice  with  TRIzol  (Invitrogen).  We  synthesized  cDNA 
from  500  ng  of  total  RNA  using  the  PrimeScriptTM  RT  re-
agent  kit  (TaKaRa,  Otsu,  Japan)  per  the  manufacturer’s 
protocol. Casz1  mRNA  was  analyzed  by  real-time  PCR. 
One-tenth  of  the  cDNA  reaction  was  added  to  a  final 
volume  of  20μL  for  each  reaction  containing  SYBR 
Green  I  (TaKaRa).  The  primers  for  Casz1 and  glycer-
aldehye-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (GAPDH)  were  5'- 
GTCTCTTCGGGAACTGCAAG-3'/5'-TGGGACACAGGCA
CTGTAGA-3'  and  5'-GCTCTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTC-3'/5'- 
CAATACGACCAAATCCGTTG-3',  respectively  (forward/re-
verse  sequence). 
    Quantitative  real-time  PCR  was  performed  on  an  ABI 
Step  One  Real-time  PCR  system  (Applied  Biosystems, 
Foster,  CA,  USA)  using  the  following  program:  45  cycles 
of  95oC  for  10  s,  60oC  for  15  s,  and  72oC  for  20  s.  To 
normalize  the  amount  of  sample  cDNA  in  each  reaction, 
the  Ct  value  of  each  target  gene  was  subtracted  by  that 
of  GAPDH  to  obtain  delta  Ct  [14].  To  calculate  the 
fold-change  in  expression,  the  delta  Ct  value  of  the 
case  sample  was  subtracted  by  that  of  the  control 
(delta  delta  Ct  =  delta  Ct  case  -  delta  Ct  control). 
    Reverse-transcription  PCR  was  performed  similarly  to 
quantitative  real-time  PCR,  except  that  it  used  35  cycles 
for  amplification.  The  PCR  products  were  separated  by 
electrophoresis  in  a  2.0%  agarose  gel  and  visualized 
under  UV  lamp  after  ethidium  bromide  staining. 

Blood  pressure  measurement

Blood  pressure  was  recorded  intraarterially  with  a  com-
puterized  data  acquisition  system  (ADInstruments,  Bella 
Vista,  Australia).  To  place  the  intraarterial  catheter,  mice 
were  anesthetized  with  avertin.  The  standard  dose  was 
0.014  mL/g  avertin,  which  was  made  by  diluting  stock 
solution  (for  stock  solution,  10  g  2,2,2,  tribromoethanol 
dissolved  in  10  mL  tertiary  amyl  alcohol)  40-fold  in  0.9% 
NaCl.  The  intraarterial  catheter,  a  polyethylene  tube  (0.2 
mm  I.D.,  0.5  mm  O.D.)  (Natsume,  Tokyo,  Japan)  that  was 
filled with 0.9% NaCl containing 100 U/mL heparin, was in-
serted  into  the  right  carotid  artery  and  tied  in  place.
    The  blood  pressure  in  the  vessel  was  transmitted 
transducer’s  diaphragm 
along 
(MLT0699  Disposable  BP  Transducer;  ADInstruments). 
The  diaphragm  signal  was  amplified  through  a  Bridge 
Amplifier  and 
recorded  on  a  PowerLab  system 
(LabChart  7.2;  ADInstruments).  Blood  pressure  was

the

monitored  for  2  h  after  the  injection  of  the  anesthetic 
and  calculated  as  the  average  blood  pressure  between 
45  min  and  75  min  after  the  injection  (1  point  per  min). 
Statistical  analysis  was  performed  using  PASW  Stati-
stics  version  18.0  (SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA),  and 
differences  in  blood  pressure  between  case  and  control 
groups  were  analyzed  by  independent  sample  t-test.

Reduction  in Casz1  mRNA  by  siRNA  injection  in-

We  examined  the  efficacies  of  3 Casz1  siRNA  oligonu-

cleotides  in  the  B16F10  mouse  melanoma  cell  line.  By 
real-time  PCR,  Casz1  mRNA  levels  fell  0%,  59%,  and 
54%,  and  we  selected  the  second  siRNA  for  the in vivo 
experiments.
    Prior  to  the  injection  of  siRNA,  Casz1  expression  in 
heart,  lung,  liver,  kidney,  spleen,  and  brain  was  meas-
ured  by  reverse-transcription  PCR.  Casz1  was  ex-
pressed  in  most  tissues  and  at  relatively  low  levels  in 
liver  (Fig.  1). 
    Casz1  siRNA  was  mixed  with  polyethylenimine,  and 
the  complex  was  injected  into  the  tail  veins  of  mice.  At 
24  h  after  siRNA  injection,  various  tissues  of  siRNA- 
treated  mice  were  analyzed  with  regard  to Casz1  mRNA 
levels.  Casz1  mRNA  expression  was  normalized  to 
GAPDH,  and  a  scrambled  siRNA  was  used  as  control.
    By  quantitative  real-time  PCR,  Casz1  mRNA  levels 
declined  only  in  kidney  (Fig.  2A). Casz1  mRNA  levels  in 
the  kidney  fell  by  45%,  55%,  and  25%  after  1,  2,  and 
3  injections  per  day,  respectively  (n  =  3  for  each  group) 
(Fig.  2B).

Blood  pressure  in  siRNA-injected  mice

Blood  pressure  was  measured  24  h  after  tail  vein  in-
jection  of  the  scrambled  or  Casz1  siRNA  (control,  n  = 
4;  case,  n  =  3).  Using  an  intraarterial  catheter  that  was 
connected  to  a  pressure  sensor,  we  recorded  blood 
pressure  continuously  for  2  h  after  anesthesia.  Blood 
pressure  did  not  change  after  a  1-time  injection  (p  = 
0.713).  Thus,  we  injected  siRNA  twice  each  day  (control, 
n  =  4;  case,  n  =  6)  but  did  not  observe  any  significant 
difference  between  the  case  and  control  groups  (p  = 
0.545).  After  3  siRNA  injections  daily  for  3  days,  blood 
pressure  was  also  unaffected  (p  =  0.297)  (Table  1, 
Supplementary  Table  1).

Discussion

This  study  attempted  to  validate CASZ1  as  a  regulator 
of  blood  pressure  using  siRNA  in  mice.  Although Casz1 
mRNA  levels  decreased  by  55%  in  kidney,  blood  pres-
sure  did  not  change  on  injection  of  the  siRNA  complex 
into  tail  veins.
    It  is  difficult  to  conclude  that CASZ1  does  not  control

blood  pressure,  because  this  study  has  several  limi-
tations.  First,  Casz1  mRNA  levels  in  kidney  were  re-
duced  up  to  55%;  if Casz1  expression  had  been  abol-
ished,  we  might  have  detected  a  significant  difference  in 
blood  pressure  between  the  case  and  control  groups. 
Second,  it  is  possible  that CASZ1  functions  in  other  tis-
sues  besides  the  kidney  in  the  regulation  of  blood 
pressure.  The  kidney  is  an  essential  organ  of  the  urinary 
system  and  controls  homeostatic  functions,  such  as  the 
regulation  of  blood  pressure,  by  maintaining  salt  and 
water  balances.  However,  the  function  of CASZ1  in  kid-
ney  is  unknown  due  to  the  lack  of  Casz1  functional 
studies  in  kidney.  Casz1  is  highly  expressed  in  brain, 
but  siRNA  nanoparticles  do  not  access  the  brain  due  to 
the  blood-brain  barrier  [15].  Third,  human  CASZ1  is 
87%  and  90%  identical  to  mouse  Casz1 in  the  cDNA 
and  polypeptide  sequences,  respectively  [1].  Neverthe-
less,  it  is  possible  that  Casz1  function  differs  between 
the  two  species. 
    Because  most  loci  that  have  been  identified  by 
GWASs  have  several  genes  nearby,  it  may  be  necessary 
to  examine  many  candidates  to  identify  the  functional 
gene.  Knockout  and  transgenic  mice  are  expensive  and 
time-consuming  to  generate.  In  contrast,  siRNA  injection 
costs  less  and  is  much  faster  to  perform,  making  siRNA 
injection  suitable  for  functional  validation  studies  of 
GWAS  results.
    In  summary,  we  did  not  observe  any  significant 
change  in  blood  pressure  in Casz1  siRNA-treated  mice, 
but  our  study  demonstrates  the  value  of in vivo  siRNA 
injection  in  the  functional  analysis  of  candidate  genes 
from  GWASs.
