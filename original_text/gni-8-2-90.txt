Abstract

A-kinase-anchoring  proteins  (AKAPs)  are  scaffold  pro-
teins  which  compartmentalize  protein  kinase  A  (PKA, 
cAMP-dependent  protein  kinase)  and  other  enzymes  to 
specific  subcellular  sites.  The  spatiotemporal  control  of 
these  enzymes  by  AKAPs  is  important  for  cellular  func-
tion  like  cell  growth  and  development  etc.  Hence,  it  is 
important  to  understand  the  basic  function  of  AKAPs 
and  their  functional  domains.  However,  diverse  names, 
function,  cellular  localizations  and  many  members  of 
AKAPs  increase  difficulties  when  researchers  search  ap-
propriate  AKAPs 
Nevertheless,  there  was  no  previous  AKAPs-related  da-
tabase  regardless  of  their  important  cellular  functions 
and  difficulty  of  finding  appropriate  AKAPs.  So,  we  de-
veloped  AKAPs  database  (AKAPDB),  which  contains 
their  sequence  information,  functions  and  other  in-
formation  derived  from  prediction  programs  and  other 
databases.  Therefore,  we  propose  that  AKAPDB  can  be 
an  important  tool  to  researchers  in  the  related  fields.

of  protein  kinases  and  phosphatases  (Scott  and  Pawson, 
2000).  The  spatiotemporal  control  of  these  enzymes  by 
AKAPs  is  important  to  metabolism,  gene  transcription, 
ion  channel  conductivity,  cell  growth,  cell  division  and 
actin  cytoskeleton  rearrangements  (Francis et al.,  1994; 
Scott,  1991).  AKAPs  are  functionally  similar,  but  struc-
turally  diverse  protein  family  which  can  be  classified  on 
the  basis  of  their  ability  to  bind  to  PKA  holoenzyme  in-
side  cells  (Colledge  et al.,  1999;  Rubin,  1994).  In  spite 
of  their  structural  diversity,  AKAPs  exist  in  many  eukary-
otic  species,  including  humans,  mice,  rats,  zebrafish, 
C.elegance  and  even  yeast.  All  AKAPs  share  three  com-
mon  features:  first,  they  have  a  PKA-anchoring  domain: 
second,  they  have  unique  subcellular  localization  do-
mains  that  target  them  to  specific  sites;  third,  they  bind 
other  signaling  molecules  to  form  multi-protein  com-
plexes  (Wong  et al.,  2004).
    Moreover,  AKAPs  have  been  reported  to  have  diverse 
names,  function,  cellular  localizations  and  many  members 
of  wide  range  of  species.  Accordingly,  it  is  rapidly  in-
creasing  in  difficulties  to  search  each  appropriate  AKAP 
for  specific  purpose.  However,  there  is  not  AKAPs-related 
database  regardless  of  their  important  cellular  function 
and  difficulty  of  finding  appropriate  AKAPs. 
    Therefore,  we  developed  AKAPDB  as  secondary  data-
base  which  focuses  on  a  specific  topic  using  from  the 
primary  database  and  other  literature  sources  (Bishop, 
1999).  AKAPDB  provides  sequence  information  and  di-
verse  function  of  AKAPs  in  all  reported  eukaryotic 
species.  It  contains  putative  phosphorylation  sites,  func-
tionally  important  domains  and  cellular  localizations  de-
rived  from  prediction  programs  and  other  databases.  In 
addition,  it  provides  predicted  zebrafish  AKAP  partial  se-
quences  which  can  be  used  for  morpholino-induced  ze-
brafish  reverse  genetics.  Morpholinos,  chemically  modi-
fied  antisense  oligonucleotides  (∼25  bases)  which  bind 
and  block  their  specific  target  mRNA,  are  an  easy  and 
efficient  technology  of  zebrafish  target-selected  func-
tional  study  (Nasevicius et al.,  2000).  So,  AKAPDB  pro-
vides  biologists  with  information  which  can  be  used  to 
the  efficient  setup  of  experiments.  AKAPDB  can  be  use-
ful  to  researchers  by  providing  AKAPs  information  and 
integrated  understanding  of  these  diverse  proteins.

Methods

Data  acquisition

Raw  data  and  information  for  AKAPDB  were  collected 
from  a  primary  database  such  as  NCBI.  And  the  pub-

lished  scientific  literatures  resulted  from  queries  with  the 
terms  ‘A-kinase-anchoring  proteins’  and  ‘AKAP’  were 
collected  from  PubMed  (Wheeler  et  al.,  2003)  and 
Google  Scholar.  Articles  that  have  been  identified  to 
contain  information  suitable  for  the  database  were  used 
to  serve  as  the  primary  source  for  data  in  AKAPDB. 
    Basic  information,  such  as  ‘Official  symbol’,  ‘Preferred 
Names’,  ‘Other  names’,  ‘Organism’,  ‘Function’,  ‘mRNA’, 
and  ‘Protein’,  were  collected  from  NCBI.  Cellular  local-
ization  of  AKAPs  was  collected  from  LOCATE  (Fink  et 
al.,  2006)  and  eSLDB  (Pierleoni et al.,  2006).  And  GPS 
2.1  (Xue et al.,  2008;  Xue  and  Ren,  2009)  served  phos-
phorylation  site  which  is  important  for  function  of 
AKAPs.  SMART  (Letunic et al.,  2008)  provides  the  pre-
diction  of  domain.  In  addition,  the  predicted  zebrafish 
AKAP  partial  sequences  were  derived  from  MegaBLAST 
(Wheeler et al.,  2006).  AKAPDB  focuses  on  the  diverse 
protein  function  and  cellular  location.

Queries  and  visualization

The  records  of  AKAPDB  consisted  of  diverse  AKAPs. 
Each  of  them  contained  16  fields,  including  information 
on  name,  cellular  localization,  function,  species,  mRNA 
sequence,  protein  sequence,  putative  phosphorylation 
site  and  predicted  zebrafish  AKAP  partial  sequences. 
Therefore,  users  can  retrieve  the  data  corresponding 
with  names,  Gene  IDs,  Protein  IDs  and  species. 

Data  fields

Structure  of  data  is  made  up  ‘Isoforms’,  ‘Gene  ID’,

‘mRNA  sequence’,  ‘mRNA  length’,  ‘Protein  ID’,  ‘Protein

‘Putative  zebrafish

functional  location  of  AKAPs  in  a  cell.  The  ‘Putative 
phosphorylation  site’  field  serves  the  functionally  im-
portant  domains  of  AKAPs.  And  the  ‘Domain  prediction’ 
field  represents  a  possible  functional  region.  Also  the 
'Putative  zebrafish  AKAP'  field  provides  potential  zebra-
fish  AKAP  sequences.  These  fields  are  linked  to  NCBI 
for  any  additional  information.

Results  and  Discussion

AKAPDB  contains  total  500  records  of  proteins  in  all  re-
ported  eukaryotic  species  from  NCBI  and  the  published 
scientific  literature  (Table  1).  The  records  of  AKAPDB 
contained  16  fields,  including  name,  cellular  localization, 
function,  species,  mRNA  sequence,  protein  sequence, 
putative  phosphorylation  site  and  predicted  zebrafish 
AKAP  partial  sequences. 
    Users  can  also  obtain  the  data  in  accordance  with 
names,  Gene  IDs,  Protein  IDs  and  species.  With  query, 
for  example,  the  database  shows  the  results  including 
‘Organism’,  ‘Official  symbol’,  ‘Preferred  Names’,  ‘Gene 
ID’,  ‘mRNA  ID’  and  ‘Protein  ID’  (Fig.  1).  In  addition, 
users  can  get  more  information  about  the  Domain 
Prediction  table  and  Putative  phosphorylation  site  from 
AKAPDB  (Fig.  2).
    Subcellular  compartmentalization  of  protein  kinases 
and  phosphatases  through  association  with  AKAPs  pro-
vides  mechanism  to  control  signal  transduction  events 
at  specific  sites  within  a  cell  (McConnachie et al.,  2006). 

AKAPs  are  a  group  of  structurally  diverse  proteins  with 
similar  function  of  binding  to  the  regulatory  subunit  of 
PKA  within  the  cell  (Michel et al.,  2002).  There  are  many 
AKAPs  for  the  reason  that  many  species  have  AKAPs 
with  diverse  forms.  Regardless  of  the  importance,  our 
understanding  of  the  AKAPs  is  restricted  due  to  diffi-
culty  of  searching  on  other  databases.  Therefore,  the 
purpose  of  AKAPDB  is  to  provide  integrated  under-
standing  of  AKAPs  and  efficient  research  tools  to 
biologists.
