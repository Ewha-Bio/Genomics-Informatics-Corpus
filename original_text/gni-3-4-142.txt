Abstract 
The immune response-related genes have been suggested 
to  be  the  most  favorable  genes  for  positive  selection 
during  evolution.  Comparing the entire  DNA sequence 
of  chimpanzee  chromosome  22  (PTR22)  with  human 
chromosome 21  (HSA21 ), we have identified 15 orthologs 
~aving indel  in  their  coding  sequences.  Among  them, 
Interferon-a  receptor-1  gene  (IFNAR1),  an  immune(cid:173)
response-related  gene,  is  subjected  to  comparative 
genomic  analysis.  Chimpanzee  JFNAR1  showed  the 
same genomic structure as  human  IFNAR1  (11  exons 
and 10 introns) except the 3 bp insertion in exon 4.  The 
IFNAR1  coding  sequence 
~e~uence  alignment  of 
1nd1cated that "ISPP" amino acid sequence motif is highly 
conserved  in  chimpanzee  and  other  animals  including 
mouse and chicken. However, the human JFNAR1 shows 
that one proline residue is missing in the sequence motif. 
The  homology  modeling  of  the  IFNAR1  structures 
suggests  that  the  proline  deletion  in  human  JFNAR1 
leads to the formation of the following  a-helix,  whereas 
two sequential pralines in chimpanzee JFNAR1 inhibit it. 
As a result,  human  IFNAR1  may adopt a characteristic 
structure distinct from chimpanzee  JFNAR1.  This human 
~pecific trait could contribute to specific immune response 
1n  the  most  optimized  manner  for  humans.  Further 
molecular biological studies on the JFNAR1 will  help us 
to gain insights into the molecular implication of species(cid:173)
specific host-pathogen interaction in primate evolution.

Introduction 
Recently,  we  reported the entire DNA sequence of the 
euchromatic  region  of  chimpanzee  chromosome  22 
(PTR22) (Watanabe eta/., 2004). The data allowed us to 
search  for  the  differences  in  nucleotide  sequence 
between human and chimpanzee. Compared with human 
chromosome 21  (HSA21 ), PTR22 differs at approximately 
1.44% of their 33 million aligned nucleotides. In addition, 
15  orthologs  among  the  231  orthologous  genes  on 
PTR22, were identified to have indels within their coding 
sequences. The indels on the coding sequences would 
potentially lead to gross structural changes on protein. It 
was hypothesized that indels may represent one of the 
m~jor mechanisms of proteome evolution  in  the higher 
pnmates (Watanabe eta/., 2004).  In terms of evolution, 
IFNAR1 among the 15 orthologs is especially interesting 
because  the  immune-response-related  genes  have 
been  suggested  to  be  the  most  favorable  genes  for 
positive  selection  during  evolution  (Endo  et a/.,  1996; 
Hughes,  1997; Sawyer eta/., 2004). 

The  IFNAR1  gene  belongs  to  the  class  II  cytokine 
receptorfa~ily (Gibbs eta/., 1996; Oritani  eta/., 2001). 
The human Interferon-a receptor is a multi-chain receptor 
complex which binds the multiple human type 1 interferons 
with  high affinity in  a species-specific manner.  JFNAR1 
en~odes one  chain  of  the  receptor  protein  (hiFN-aR), 
wh1ch  contains  an  extracellular  domain  of  409  amino 
acids,  a  single  transmembrane  domain  of  21  amino 
acids,  and  an  IC  domain  of  1 00-amino  acids.  Mice  in 
which  the  gene  for  IFNAR1  has  been  inactivated  by 
h~mologous recombination are unresponsive to all type 
I  Interferons  and  are  unable  to  mount  an  effective 
antiviral defense (Muller eta/., 1994; Hwang eta/., 1995). 
These findings suggest that IFNAR1 is a signal- transducing 
chain of the multi-component receptor complex that has 
low  affinity  binding  for  most  IFN-a  subspecies  and  is 
essential for type I interferon mediated responses. Type 1 
interferons induce the transcription of interferon-stimulated 
genes  through  the  formation  and  activation  of  ISRE(cid:173)
bindi~g pr~t~ins. Many interferon-stimulated genes play 
roles 1n ant1v1ral  responces via innate immune mechanism 
(Asaoka eta/., 2005; Osiak eta/., 2005). 

In  this· study,  we  analyzed  and  compared  genomic 
IFNAR1  gene  between  human  and 
structure  of 
chimpanzee  and  discuss  its  consequence  on  protein 
structure  with  implication  of  immune-response-related

Results and Discussion 
Genonic structure of IFNAR1 gene in Olifll)811Zee 
and Human 
Genomic organization of chimpanzee /FNAR1 gene was 
analyzed  and  compared  with 
that  of  human.  To 
understand the genomic characteristics of chimpanzee 
IFNAR1, we predicted genomic structure of chimpanzee 
IFNAR1  (Ensenbl  gene  ID:  ENSPTRG00000013867) 

using  est2genome  program  (Matt  et  at.,  1997).  The 
program  was  run  by  matching  human  Ensembl  gene 
(ENSG00000142166) as a query sequence to chimpanzee 
genomic  DNA  sequence.  The  chimpanzee  IFNAR1 
(ENSPTRG00000013867)  showed  the  genomic size of 
42,648 bp and the same gene structure as human IFNAR1. 
As  shown  in  Fig.1,  human  and  chimpanzee  /FNAR1s 
are composed of 11  exons and  10 introns. The obvious 
difference  between  the  two  genes  is  that  chimpanzee 
IFNAR1 has about 8 kb insertion between exon 1 and 2. 
Since upstream  sequences from  the transcription  start 
site have been known to be important for gene regulation,

Fig.  1. Comparative analysis of IFNAR1 gene in Human and Chimpanzee. 
Human and chimpanzee mapped gene structure, G+C content, position of CpG islands, interspersed repeats (SINEs, LINEs, L TR elements, Simple 
repeats), tandem repeats are represented. The UTR (untranslated region) is colored in yellow. The direction of transcription is indicated from left to 
right side. The window size of G+C content is 500 bp.  CpG islands at the middle of gene annotation section are predicted using a modification of the 
CpG  program  (Takai  eta/.,  2002).  The interspersed  repeats  are  identified  using the  RepeatMasker  program  (Smit & Green,  unpublished  data). 
Tandem repeats are predicted by TRF program (Benson.  1999). 

we  analyzed  transcription  factor  binding  sites  (TFBS) 
from the 3 kb upstream transcription start site of IFNAR1 
in  both  species  using  rVista·  (limited  vertebrate  TF, 
Matrix similarity 0.95).  We had identified 35 TFBS from 
the upstream sequence of human IFNAR1 and confirmed 
all of the TFBSs are conserved in chimpanzee genome 
(Table  1)  suggesting  that  the  regulation  of  IFNAR1 
expression might is similar in both the species. Next, we 
tried to speculate the changes in coding sequence (CDS) 
of human  IFNAR1  caused  by the  genomic change.  As 
shown in Fig. 2,  human /FNAR1 has 9 base substitution 
and 3 bp insertion in exon 4. The 3 bp insertion in exon 4 
resulted  in  the addition  of  amino acid  proline at amino 
acid position 149. The 4 out of 9 base substitutions led to 
amino acid substitutions of Vai4Aia, Thr68Pro, Ala425Val 
and Ser478Asn.  IFNAR1 provides a unique example of 
cross-species orthologs in that they are from evolutionarily 
closed primates. As most of gene structures are almost 
identical  for  primates,  sequences  with  such  striking 
difference are available only in a few cases. In this context, 
the 3 bp indel in the orthologs of IFNAR1 is very exceptional. 
Thus,  species-specific,  rapidly diverging insertions or 
deletions may contribute to gene diversification during 
evolution. 

Proline indel results in structural difference between 
human and chimpanzee IFNAR1s 
To  determine  whether  the  proline  indel  affects  the 

three-dimensional  structure of  IFNAR1,  we carried  out 
the  homology  modeling  of  human  and  chimpanzee 
IFNAR1s, using the program SwissModel. The template 
was derived from the crystal structure of the extracellular 
domain  (ECD)  in  human  Interferon  y  receptor  a  chain 
(PDB code 1 FYH:E) (Randal eta/., 2001 ). The Interferon 
y  receptor  a  chain  shows  28%  identity  and  52% 
similarity of amino acid sequence with  human  IFNAR1 
for  the  residues  60-128.  It  also  has  22%  identity  and 
44% similarity of sequence with chimpanzee IFNAR1 for 
the  residues  60-205.  The  comparison  of  the  modeled 
structures  reveals  the  obvious  structural  difference  in 
the  vicinity  of  Pro149  in  the  ligand  binding  domain  of 
chimpanzee JFNAR1  (Fig. 4).  Fig. 4A shows the crystal 
structure  of the  ECD  in  human  Interferon  y  receptor  a 
chain.  In  the  structure,  Pro131  of  human  Interferon  y 
receptor  a chain  corresponds  to the  site  of the  proline 
insertion in chimpanzee IFNAR1.  In the human Interferon 
y  receptor  a  chain,  Pro131  serve  as  connecting  the 
preceding 13-strand and the following a-helix, kinking the 
running  direction  of  the  backbone.  In  human  /FNAR1, 
Pro148  corresponds  to  Pro131  of  human  Interferon  y 
receptor a chain, playing the same role (Fig. 48). On the 
other hand,  in chimpanzee IFNAR1,  Pro149 is inserted 
at  the  same  position  and  thus  two  sequential  pralines 
(Pro148  and  Pro149)  are  present  (Fig.  4C). 
It  is 
interesting to find that the following a-helix is not formed 
due  to  the  presence  of  two  sequential  pralines.  We

suggest  that  the  proline  deletion  in  human  IFNAR1 
results in the formation of the following a-helix, changing 
the conservation of secondary structure pattern. 

In addition to the proline indel, there are 4 amino acid 
substitutions between human and chimpanzee IFNAR1s. 
The  most  noticeable  one  is  the  change  from  Thr68  in 
human 
IFNAR1 
(Thr68Pro).  The  residue  68  in  IFNAR1  corresponds to 
Tyr49  of  human  Interferon  'l  receptor  a  chain.  The 
side-chain oxygen atom of Tyr49 was observed to form 

in  chimpanzee 

IFNAR1 

to  Pro68 

the  intermolecular  hydrogen  bond  with  the  side-chain 
oxygen of Glu312 in  interferon 'l (Randal  eta/., 2001). 
Therefore, it is likely that the substitution at the position 
effects on interferon 'l binding. We suggest that Thr68 in 
human  IFNAR1  potentially  forms  the  same  hydrogen 
bond  as  in  human  Interferon  'l  receptor  but  Pro68  in 
chimpanzee  /FNAR1  cannot since it has no side-chain 
oxygen  atom  capable  of  making  hydrogen  bonds.  In 
addition,  Thr68  may  form  the  part  of  13-strand  like  in 
human  Interferon  'l receptor but  Pro68 cannot since  it

has no main-chain amide proton. The other substitutions 
contain  Vai4Aia,  Ala425Val,  and  Ser478Asn.  These 
substitutions are not likely to induce significant alteration 
in the secondary structure as the properties of changed 
amino acids are similar. 

Implication for molecular function  and  evolution 
of immune-response-related genes 
Multiple  sequence  alignment  of  IFNAR1  from  human, 
chimpanzee,  and  other  animals  including  mouse,  rat 
and  chicken,  indicated  that  "ISPP"  motif  in  the  ligand 
binding domain of  IFNAR1  is highly conserved  in  all  of 
the other animals from chicken to chimpanzee (Fig.  5). 
The human  IFNAR1 showed that one proline residue is 
missing  in the segment,  implying that the proline might 
be  deleted after divergence  from  common  ancestor of 
human and chimpanzee during evolution. It is striking to 
notice that this conserved sequence motif is likely to be 
the only region that bears significant difference between 
the  human  and  nonhuman  hominoids.  Our  homology 
modeling study reveals the structural difference between 
human and chimpanzee IFNAR1s.  The proline deletion 
in human IFNAR11eads to the formation of the following 
a-helix, whereas two sequential pralines in chimpanzee 
IFNAR1  inhibit  it  (Fig.  4).  At  present,  the  functional 
implication of these differences in the IFNAR1 structure 
is not clear. However, it has been reported that /FNAR1 
expression  is  related  to  the  effectiveness  of interferon 
therapy  in  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)-associated  chronic 
liver disease (CLD) (Fukuda eta/., 1996). Furthermore, it 
was also reported that great apes could be infected with 
human hepatitis viruses,  but usually do not progress to 
cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinomas as often seen in 
human  (Muchmore eta/.,  1988). Therefore,  it would be

Fig. 5. Multiple alignment with IFNAR1  coding sequences of human, chimpanzee, mouse and chicken. Multiple alignment was done 
using clustaiX program {Thompson,  eta/, 1994). Red rectangle indicate 'ISPP' motif of domain in ligand binding domain. Ruler is the 
position of base pair. 

interesting  to  examine  a  possibility  that  functional 
consequences of  IFNAR1 differences may related with 
the differences in efficacy of interferon therapy or cirrhotic 
progression in both the species during chronic hepatitis 
C virus infection. Although the establishment of biological 
significance of human specific variations has a long way 
to  go,  this  kind  of genomic change  might  be  the  most 
important  in  the  development  of  human  traits.  Human 
specific traits,  such  as  those changes  in  IFNAR1  may 
contribute to distinctive biological properties of immune(cid:173)
response  to  pathogens  and  specific adaptations  in  the 
human lineage. 

In  this study,  we showed that human  IFNAR1 has 3 
base  pair  deletion  in  genomic  DNA,  compared  with 
chimpanzee ortholog. As a consequence, human IFNAR1 
may  adopt  a  characteristic  structure  distinct  from 
chimpanzee IFNAR1 and this human specific trait could 
contribute  to  specific  immune  response  in  the  most 
optimized manner for humans. Further molecular biological 
studies on  the  IFNAR1 will  help us to gain insights into 
the molecular implication of species specific host-pathogen 

interaction in primate evolution.
