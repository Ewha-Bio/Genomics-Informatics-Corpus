To  learn  the  differences  between  the  structure-activity  relationship  and  molecular  vibration-activity  relationship  in  the 
ligand-receptor  interaction of  the histamine receptor,  47 ligands  of  the  histamine  receptor  were  analyzed  by structural 
similarity and molecular vibrational frequency patterns. The radial tree that was produced by clustering analysis of molecular 
vibrational frequency patterns shows its potential for the functional classification of histamine receptor ligands.

Keywords: corralled  intensity  of  molecular  vibrational  frequency,  G  protein-coupled  receptors,  histamine  receptors, 

molecular vibration-activity relationship

Introduction

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are regarded to take 
up more than one-fourth of marketed human medicines [1, 
2]. Drugs targeting GPCRs account for the majority of the 
best-selling  drugs  and  about  40%  of  all  prescription 
pharmaceuticals in the marketplace [3].

Histamine receptors belong to one family of rhodopsin- 
like  class  A  GPCRs,  and  four  subtypes  are  named  in 
chronological order as H1, H2, H3, and H4. Histamine exerts 
its  effects  through  the  activation  of  these  four  histamine 
receptors. Each type of histamine receptor reacts to subtype- 
specific ligands into an active or inactive form.

GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that consist of 7 
transmembrane segments connected by 3 intracellular and 3 
extracellular loops of variable length. The crystal structures 
of  GPCRs  with  their  binding  ligands  have  revealed  the 
features of the ligand binding pockets and extracellular loops 
[4-6]. A ligand of GPCR activates the receptor by changing 
the receptor structure to the active form.

The  biogenic  amine  histamine  [2-(1H-imidazol-5-yl) 
ethanamine]  (Fig.  1)  is  produced  by  decarboxylation  of 
L-histidine  and  acts  as  a  chemical  mediator  and  neuro-
transmitter in central and peripheral tissues. It acts as an 

important pharmacological modulator involved in the pro-
cesses of allergy, inflammation, neurophysiology, and cancer 
[7-10].

The  molecular  understanding  of  ligand-receptor  inter-
actions of GPCR remains unclear and is still the subject of 
investigations.  There  are  several  theories  explaining  the 
ligand-receptor  interaction  mechanism,  such  as  shape 
theory, binding theory, and vibration theory [11, 12]. The 
structures of histamine receptor ligands are so variable that 
we can not easily classify the pharmacological function of the 
ligand.  To  find  any  other  characteristic  in  the  molecular 
patterns  between  agonists  and  antagonists  of  histamine 
receptors, a computational approach to molecular vibration 
was carried out in an attempt to find a bit of the molecular 
interaction mechanisms. 

Methods

The  simplified  molecular-input 

line-entry  system 
(SMILES) and 3-dimensional structure data format (SDF) 
files  of  the  dataset  were  downloaded  from  the  PubChem 
Compound Database in National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) and used in the further analyses. All 47

agonists and 38 histamine antagonists, are shown in Table 1.

Structure comparison of histamine receptor ligands

The molecular similarities between histamine and other 
46 chemicals were calculated from SMILES of the chemicals. 
The structural similarity was calculated and represented as 
the Tanimoto distance of each molecule from histamine. The 
Tanimoto coefficient for pairwise comparison of molecules is 
the  most  widely  used  measure  of  molecular  structural 
similarity. This coefficient is defined as Tc = Nab/(Na ＋ Nb －
Nab),  with Nab  being  the  number of  common  bits, Na  the 
unique bits in molecule a, and Nb the unique bits in molecule 
b,  using  a  molecular  fingerprint  [13].  In  this  study,  the 
molecular  similarity  was  calculated  as  the  Tanimoto 
coefficient using the 38-bit set.

Geometry optimization and calculation of molecular 
vibrational frequency

In order to calculate molecular vibrational frequency, the 
structure  of  a  chemical  must  first  be  geometrically  opti-
mized. Since each provided theoretical 3-D conformer SDF is 
not at an energy minimum and may not represent the lowest 
energetic form in a vacuum, solvent, or a binding pocket, 
each SDF file of a ligand molecule underwent conversion to 
a single low-energy conformation using the general atomic 
and  molecular  electronic  structure  system  (GAMESS) 
program  package  [14].  Restricted  Hartree-Fock  (RHF) 
calculations  using  Becke's  exchange  and  Lee-Yang-Parr’s 
correlation  functionals  (BLYP)  density  functional  theory 
(DFT)  method  with  6-31G  basis  set  were  performed  to 
optimize the geometries of the molecules. Each result was 
taken as the representative conformation of the molecule, 
although the calculation of molecular vibrational frequency 
has  some  dependence  on  conformation.  Each  geometry 
optimization result was subjected to the calculation step for 
the vibrational frequency with RUNTYP of HESSIAN in the 
GAMESS program.

SJ  Oh.  Characteristics  in  Histamine  Receptor  Ligands

Hierarchical clustering of the corralled intensity of 
molecular vibrational frequency (CIMVF)

For the simplified molecular comparison, the calculated 
vibrational frequencies of a molecule were then sorted in 
increasing order and taken into the corrals, the step size of 
which was 5. The intensities of each frequency in the same 
corral were summed up as the representative of the corral in 
the frequency range of 0-5,000 cm-1. As a final outcome, this 
potential  molecular  descriptor  of  each  molecule  was  dis-
played in a 1-dimensional vector containing 1,000 elements. 
Finally, the similarity matrix, comprising the descriptors of 
47  ligands  of  histamine  receptor,  was  then  subjected  to 
hierarchical clustering in the agglomerative manner. In this 
study, the similarity matrix was finally clustered to make an 
unrooted tree of 47 vertices. The calculations of CIMVF were 
performed by in-house scripts, written in Python.

Results and Discussion

The Tanimoto coefficients between histamine and other 
ligand molecules are shown in Table 2. Typically, a Tanimoto 
coefficient  ＞ 0.85  is  considered  highly  similar,  and  a 
coefficient ＞ 0.75 is considered similar for the purpose of 

clustering molecules that may have similar biological activity 
profiles  [15].  The  highest  Tanimoto  coefficient  among 
agonists was 0.45 (imetit), and this is not high enough to be 
considered  a  molecule  that  has  potential  agonist  efficacy. 
Moreover, the lowest value of Tanimoto coefficient among 
agonists was 0.08 (dimaprit and SKF91488) and is also a 
lower value as an antagonist. It seems that there is no related 
pattern between Tanimoto coefficients and the functional 
types of molecules in the case of histamine receptor agonists 
or antagonists.

To search for a novel characteristic for the classification of 
histamine receptor ligands, a kind of molecular calculation 
using agglomerative hierarchical clustering was adopted in 
this work. The result of the hierarchical clustering of the 
similarity matrix from CIMVF is shown in Fig. 2. As shown 
in the figure, eight agonists were located nearby (the part in 
the dotted circle), except impromidine, and all antagonists 
were clustered close to each other in the radial tree. We can 
tell the regional difference between agonists and antagonists 
in  the  tree  and  also  find  that  the  information  from  the 
molecular  vibrational  frequency  may  play  a  role  in  the 
classification of agonists/antagonists for histamine receptor 
as  a  possible  molecular  descriptor.  For  these  methods, 
clustering with CIMVF shows the more proper result in the
