Abstract 
Targeting of complex system such as human cells rather 
than  biochemically  pure  molecules  will  be  a  useful 
approach  to  massively  identify  ligands  specific for the 
markers associated with human disease such as cancer 
and  simultaneously  discover  the  specific  molecular 
markers.  In this study,  we  developed  in  vitro selection 
method  to 
identify  nuclease-resistant  nucleic  acid 
ligands called RNA aptamers that are specific for human 
cancer cells. This method is based on the combination of 
the  cell-based  selection  and  subtractive  systematic 
evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) 
method. These aptamers will be useful for cancer-specific 
ligands for proteomic research to identify cancer-specific 
molecular  markers  as  well  as  tumor  diagnosis  and 
therapy. 

Keywords: cancer,  proteomics, RNA aptamers, SELEX 

RNA can adopt stable tertiary structures to specifically 
bind target molecules with high affinities and specificities 
and  encode  easily  amplificable  genetic  information. 
Therefore, RNAs could be a very useful agent tor basic 
research  and  diagnostic and therapeutic aims (Gold  et 
a/.,  1993;  Burgstaller  eta/.,  2002).  Such  RNA  ligands 
with  short  size,  termed  RNA  aptamers,  have  been 
identified for a host range of targets including proteins, 
carbohydrates, and small chemicals, etc., from a random 
RNA library using in vitro iterative selection techniques, 
called  systematic  evolution  of  ligands  by  exponential 
enrichment  (SELEX)  (Ellington  and  Szostak,  1990; 
Tuerkand Gold, 1990). Recently, several RNAaptamers 
were  reported  to  have  potentials  of  diagnostic  ligands 
and  even  therapeutic  potentials  from  animal  disease

models (Sullenger and Gilboa, 2002; Hwang eta/., 2003; 
Rusconi eta/., 2004). Targeting a complex target mixture 
such  as  human  red  blood  cell  ghosts  was  reported  to 
identify a  pool  of aptamers  using  selection  procedure, 
called  'complex  targets  SELEX'  (Morris  et  a/.,  1998). 
Such 
than 
biochemically pure molecules will be useful to massively 
identify  specific  molecular  markers  associated  with 
human  disease  and  simultaneously  identify  ligands 
specific tor the  markers  without prior knowledge  of any 
molecular  changes  associated  with  the  disease  state 
(Daniels eta/., 2003).

In this study, we established in vitro SELEX method 
which  is  based  on  the  combination  of  the  cell-based 
selection  with  subtractive  SELEX  method  for  the 
selection  of  nuclease-resistant  RNA  aptamers  specific 
for the cancer cell surface. 

SELEX procedure for RNA aptamers to 
cancer cell 
We  selected  RNase-resistant  RNA  aptamers 
to 
specifically recognize the target cancer cell lines, Jurkat 
T  leukemia  cells,  but  not  normal  peripheral  blood 
mononuclear  cells  (PBMC).  A  random  RNA  library  of 
-1014  different  molecules  was  created  with  every 
pyrimidine modified at  its 2'  position  by a fluoro group. 
The sequence of the RNA library was 5' -GGGAUACCA 
GCUUAUUCAAUUNsoAGAUAGUAAGUGCAAUCU-3', 
where  Nso  denotes  60  nucleotides  (nts)  with  the 
equimolar  incorporation  of  A,  G,  C,  and  U  at  each 
position.  Therefore,  each  molecule 
library 
harbored 60-nt  long  region  derived from  a randomized 
sequence 
flanked  by  defined  sequences.  The 
modification  of  the  2'  position  of  RNA  improved  its 
stability in  human  serum  more than  10,000 fold,  when 
compared  with  unmodified  2'  hydroxyl  RNA  (Seo  and 
Lee,  2000;  Lee  and  Sullenger,  1996,  1997).  We 
employed  subtractive  SELEX  procedure  to  preclude 
nonspecific  RNAs  that  bind  to  normal  cells  as  follows. 
Five fig of the RNA library was first incubated at 37°C  for 
1 hr with 1.5x1 05 of normal PBMC in 200 pi of a binding 
buffer (30 mM Tris-HCI,  pH  7.5,  150 mM  NaCI,  1.5 mM 
MgCb, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% BSA), and any RNAs 
that  had  bound  to  the  molecules  on  the  normal  cell 
surface  have  been  discarded  by  centrifugation.  The

Fig. 1. Sequences of selected 2'-fluoro RNA aptamers. Selected RNAs against Jurkat cells were reverse transcribed, and 
the resulting  cDNAs were PCR amplified and subcloned.  Fourteen different clones were sequenced.  Clones containing 
similar sequences were grouped together. C and U in this figure correspond to 2'-fluoro C and 2'-fluoro U, respectively. 

precleared  supernatant  RNA  pools  were  then  reacted 
with 1.5x1 05 of the target Jurkat cells, and the leukemia 
cell-RNA  complexes  precipitated.  Bound  RNAs  were 
amplified and transcribed to generate RNA for the next 
cycle of selection,  as  previously described  (Bae  et at., 
2002;  Lee and Sullenger,  1996,  1997). The subtractive 
procedure was performed prior to every selection round. 
After total  13 rounds  of  selection,  the  amplified  eDNA 
was  cloned  and  sequenced.  Different  RNAs  were 
selected probably due to diverse target molecules on the 
surface of the Jurkat cells (Fig.  1 ). 

Cancer-specific binding of the selected 
RNAaptamers 
To assess the enrichment of the selected RNAs, pool of 
amplified  cDNAs  of  the  selected  RNAs  was  in  vitro 
transcribed,  and 
the  purified  RNA  (200  ng)  was 
incubated  with  5x105  of  PBMC  or  Jurkat  cells.  The 
bound  RNAs  were  then  reverse  transcribed,  and  the 
resulting  eDNA  was  amplified 
(forward  primer, 

5'-GGGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATACCAGCTT 
ATTCATT: reverse primer, 5-AGATTGCACTTACTATCT) 
with  10 thermal  cycles.  The semi-quantitative  RT-PCR 
analysis of the  selected  RNA aptamers  bound  to cells 
showed that the RNAs were enriched specifically to the 
Jurkat cells (data not shown). 

To  confirm  that  the  pool  of  the  selected  RNAs 
specifically  bound  to  the  target  cells,  flow  cytometry

analysis  was  performed  with  FITC-Iabeled  aptamers 
(Fig. 2).  FITC-Iabeled RNA aptamers were prepared as 
described  (Rosemeyer  et  a/.,  1995).  Briefly,  in  vitro 
transcribed  RNA aptamers (121  pmol)  were labeled at 
their 3'  ends by incubation with 5X reaction  buffer (200 
mM potassium cacodylate, 25 mM Tris-HCI, pH 6.6, 0.25 
mg/ml  BSA,  0.5  mM  dNTP),  0.5  mM  FITC-dUTP 
(Roche), 5 mM CoCb, and 20 U terminal deoxynucleotide 
transferase (Roche) in a final volume of 30 fl~ for 30 min 
at 37°C.  FITC-Iabeled RNA aptamers (30 pmoles) were 
then incubated with 1 x1 06  normal PBMC or Jurkat cells. 
FITC  fluorescence  was  monitored  using  FACScan 
apparatus (Becton Dickinson). Results were represented 
as frequency distribution histograms of log fluorescence. 
FITC-Iabeled  RNA  pools  after  131
h  round  bound  more 
strongly to Jurkat T cells, by about 7-fold in fluorescence 
intensity,  than  to  the  normal  PBMC.  By  contrast, 
FITC-Iabeled RNA library hardly bound to either PBMC 
or Jurkat cells (data not shown). These results  indicate 
that  the  selected  RNA  aptamers  specifically  bound  to 
the Jurkat T leukemia cells. 

Recently,  large efforts are focused on the identification 
of  specific  messages  associated  with  a  wide  range  of 
human diseases including cancers (Strausberg eta/. 2004). 
Conventional  SELEX  procedure  could  be  conducted  to 
isolate cancer -specific RNA aptarners with purified proteins 
after  expression  of the  specific  messages.  However,  an 
obvious  advantage  of  the  cell-based  subtractive  SELEX 
developed  here is that a  specific disease such as cancer 
could be targeted without prior knowledge of any molecular 
alterations related to the disease state (Daniels eta/., 2003). 
Noticeably,  any  nonspecific  RNAs  that  can  bind  to 
nontargeted  cell  surface  could  be  easily  eliminated  by 
is  simply 
employing 
incubating nondesirable cells and discarding RNAs binding 
to  the  cells.  These  aptamers  can  be  applied  to  specific 
diagnosis,  imaging,  and  therapy  of  tumor  (Lupoid  eta/., 
2002).  Moreover,  characterization  of  molecular  targets 
against  the  RNA  aptamers  will  be  of  important  use  to 
identify novel specific molecular markers of the cancer.
