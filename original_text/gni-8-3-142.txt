Abstract

In  recent  years,  genome-wide  association  (GWA)  studies 
have  successfully  led  to  many  discoveries  of  genetic 
variants  affecting  common  complex  traits,  including 
height,  blood  pressure,  and  diabetes.  Although  GWA 
studies  have  made  much  progress  in  finding  single  nu-
cleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  associated  with  many 
complex  traits,  such  SNPs  have  been  shown  to  explain 
only  a  very  small  proportion  of  the  underlying  genetic 
variance  of  complex  traits.  This  is  partly  due  to  that  fact 
that  most  current  GWA  studies  have  relied  on  sin-
gle-marker  approaches  that  identify  single  genetic  fac-
tors  individually  and  have  limitations  in  considering  the 
joint  effects  of  multiple  genetic  factors  on  complex 
traits.  Joint  identification  of  multiple  genetic  factors 
would  be  more  powerful  and  provide  a  better  prediction 
of  complex  traits,  since  it  utilizes  combined  information 
across  variants.  Recently,  a  new  statistical  method  for 
joint  identification  of  genetic  variants  for  common  com-
plex  traits  via  the  elastic-net  regularization  method  was 
proposed.  In  this  study,  we  applied  this  joint  identi-
fication  approach  to  a  large-scale  GWA  dataset  (i.e., 
8842  samples  and  327,872  SNPs)  in  order  to  identify 
genetic  variants  of  obesity  for  the  Korean  population.  In 
addition,  in  order  to  test  for  the  biological  significance 
of  the  jointly  identified  SNPs,  gene  ontology  and  path-
way  enrichment  analyses  were  further  conducted.

Introduction

Advances  in  genotyping  technologies  have  allowed  us 
to  move  from  candidate  gene  approaches  to  large-scale 
genome-wide  association  (GWA)  approaches  (Hirschhorn

and  Daly,  2005;  Wang et al.,  2005)  for  identifying  genetic 
variants  for  common  complex  diseases.  In  recent  years, 
GWA  studies  have  led  to  many  discoveries  of  genetic 
variants  affecting  common  complex  traits,  including 
height,  blood  pressure,  and  diabetes  (Li  et al.,  2008; 
Saxena et al.,  2007;  Sladek et al.,  2007;  Thorleifsson et 
al.,  2009;  Wallace  et al.,  2008;  Weedon  et al.,  2008). 
    Obesity,  among  many  disease-related  phenotypes,  is 
becoming  more  important,  because  obesity  is  the  one  of 
the  risk  factors  for  many  chronic  diseases,  such  as  type 
2  diabetes,  cardiovascular  disease,  hypertension,  and 
some  types  of  cancer  (Bell  et al.,  2005;  Hfker  and 
Wijmenga,  2009;  Hill  and  Peters,  1998;  Ichihara  et al., 
2008).  With  the  increasing  adoption  of  Western  life-
styles,  the  prevalence  of  obesity  is  rapidly  catching  up 
in  the  developing  world  (Must et al.,  1999).  As  a  com-
mon  complex  phenotype,  obesity  is  the  result  of  genes, 
environmental  factors,  and  interactions  between  the 
genes  and  environmental  factors  (Farooqi  and  O’Rahilly, 
2007;  Feitosa  et al.,  2002;  Scuteri  et al.,  2007).
    Much  research  has  identified  genetic  factors  asso-
ciated  with  obesity-related  phenotypes  using  single  nu-
cleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs).  Body  mass  index  (BMI), 
defined  as  weight  (kg)/height  (m2),  is  the  most  com-
monly  used  measurement  of  obesity  status.  The  World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  recommends  the  following 
cutoff  points  for  BMI  to  classify  weight  status  in  adults 
20  years  of  age  or  older:  ＜18.5  kg/m2  (under  weight), 
18.5-24.9  kg/m2  (normal  weight),  25.0-29.9  kg/m2  (over 
weight),  30.0-30.9  kg/m2  (obese),  and  ≥40  kg/m2  (ex-
tremely  obese).  Scuteri  et al.  conducted  association 
studies  with  BMI,  hip  circumstance,  and  weight.  They 
reported  that  common  genetic  variants  in  the  FTO  gene 
are  associated  with  substantial  changes  in  three  obe-
sity-related  phenotypes  (Scuteri et al.,  2007).  Feitosa et 
al.  used  BMI  and  performed  a  linkage  study  from  the 
National  Heart,  Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  Family  Heart 
Study.  They  found  significant  signals  near  the  leptin 
gene  (chromosome  7q32.3)  and  chromosome  13q14 
(Feitosa et al.,  2002).  Liu et al.  identified  the  CTNNBL1 
gene  for  obesity  from  US  Caucasian  and  French  repli-
cation  case-control  samples.  They  also  confirmed  the 
previously  identified  associations  between  obesity  and 
INSIG2  and  PFKP  (Liu  et al.,  2008). 
    Loos et al.  performed  association  studies  in  chromo-
somal  region  18q21  and  reported  that  common  variants 
near  the  MC4R  gene  influence  fat  mass,  weight,  and 
obesity  risk  (Loos et al.,  2008).  Thorleifsson et al.  con-

in  chromosomal 

ducted  genome-wide  association  studies  for  BMI  and 
weight.  Using  11  significant  genome-wide  loci,  they  also 
conducted  association  tests  with  obesity  (obese  for  BMI 
≥30,  normal  18.5＜BMI＜25)  and  type  2  diabetes  and 
reported  significant 
region 
12q13  with  both  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes  (Thorleifs-
son  et al,  2009). 
    Willer  et al.  performed  genome-wide  studies  with 
quantitative  BMI  phenotype  and  binary  traits  (overweight 
(BMI≥25)  or  obese  (BMI≥30)).  They  confirmed  a  strong 
association  of  FTO  and  MC4R  with  BMI  and  identified 
candidate  causal  loci:  the  TMEM18,  KCTD15,  GNPDA2, 
SH2B1,  MTCH2,  and  NEGR1  genes.  They  also  analyzed 
the  impact  of  gene  expression  and  copy  number  poly-
morphisms  (CNPs)  on  BMI  (Willer  et al.,  2008). 
    However,  most  genome-wide  association  studies  have 
relied  on  single-marker  approaches  that  test  individual 
associations  between  single  SNPs  and  the  trait.  However, 
single-SNP  approaches  can  be  optimal  for  Mendelian 
traits  and  may  not  be  appropriate  for  investigating  a 
common  complex  polygenic  trait  because  of  the  follow-
ing  reasons.  First,  it  would  be  hard  to  test  and  predict 
the  accumulated  and/or  joint  effects  of  multiple  genetic 
factors  on  the  trait.  Second,  due  to  the  large  number  of 
individual  tests  in  GWA  analyses,  a  certain  multiple  test-
ing  correction  procedure  is  required  to  reduce  the  test-
ing  correction  procedures.  Only  a  small  number  of 
markers  pass  the  genome-wide  significance  level,  and 
they  do  not  fully  explain  the  etiology  of  common  com-
plex  traits.
    When  multiple  genetic  factors  exist  for  a  common 
complex  trait,  the  joint  identification  of  such  factors 
would  be  more  powerful  and  provide  a  better  prediction 
of  the  trait,  since  it  utilizes  combined  information  across 
multiple  genetic  variants.  For  example,  traditional  ap-
proaches,  such  as  multiple  linear/logistic  regression 
methods  with  a  variable  selection  procedure,  can  use 
joint  identification.  However,  there  are  some  difficulties 
in  applying  multiple 
to  GWA 
analysis.  Since  the  number  of  predictor  variables  is  rela-
tively  larger  than  the  sample  sizes,  multiple  regression 
methods  are  ill-defined  and  induce  a  computational  bur-
den  for  variable  selection  procedures.  In  addition,  multi-
collinearity  problems  may  exist  due  to  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  among  SNPs.  To  improve  power  in 
identifying  multiple  genetic  variants  associated  with  obe-
sity,  more  powerful  statistical  methods  need  to  be  de-
veloped  for  genome-wide  association  studies.
    To  capture  multiple  putative  genetic  variants  for  com-
mon  complex  diseases,  Cho et al.  (2010)  proposed  new 
statistical  methods  using  an  elastic-net  (EN)  regulariza-
tion  method  along  with  some  consistency  measures 
based  on  bootstrap  sampling.  The  EN  regularization

method  was  originally  proposed  for  model  fitting  and 
variable  selection 
ill-defined  multiple  regressions 
(Tibshirani,  1996;  Zou  and  Hastie,  2005)  and  has  been 
applied  to  GWA  analyses  very  recently  (Shi et al.,  2008; 
Wu  et al.,  2009). 
    In  this  paper,  we  applied  the  EN  regularization  meth-
od  to  a  large-scale  GWA  dataset  (i.e.,  8842  samples 
and  327,872  SNPs)  in  order  to  identify  genetic  variants 
of  obesity  in  the  Korean  population.  In  addition,  in  order 
to  test  for  the  biological  significance  of  the  jointly  identi-
fied  SNPs,  gene  ontology  and  pathway  enrichment  anal-
yses  were  further  conducted. 

Methods

KARE  data

The  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project,  estab-
lished  as  part  of  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiology 
Study  (KoGES)  in  2001,  was  started  to  undertake  a 
large-scale  genome-wide  association  analysis  in  Korean 
population-based  cohorts.  These  cohorts  consisted  of 
10,038  participants  in  the  urban  Ansan  (n=5020)  and  ru-
ral  Ansung  (n=5018)  communities.  In  this  analysis,  we 
focused  on  BMI,  one  of  more  than  260  lifestyle-related 
traits. 
    DNA  samples  were  isolated  from  the  peripheral  blood 
of  all  participants  and  were  genotyped  with 
the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0.  Geno-
types  were  called  using  Bayesian  Robust  Linear  Model-
ing  and  the  Mahalanobis  Distance  (BRLMM)  algorithm 
(Rabbee  and  Speed,  2006).  We  performed  quality  con-
trol  processes  for  the  samples  and  genotypes  as  pre-
viously  described  in  Cho  et al.  (2009).  In  order  to  in-
crease  coverage  of  the  common  variants  and  capture 
additional  association  signals,  we  performed  SNP  im-
putation  with  PLINK  using  the  JPT/CHB  component  of 
HapMap  as  the  reference.  After  sample  and  genotype 
quality  control,  327,872  SNPs  for  8842  individuals  were 
available  in  the  KARE  data.  We  applied  our  proposed 
regularization  method  to  Korean  genome-wide  data. 

Statistical  methods

In  order  to  identify  multiple  causal  SNPs  among  a  huge 
number  of  SNPs,  we  conducted  a  multi-stage  proce-
dure,  proposed  by  Cho et al.  (2010).  In  the  first  stage, 
we  selected  SNPs  having  an  association  with  the  trait 
via  single-SNP  association  tests.  In  the  second  stage, 
the  multiple-SNP  associations  were  searched  based  on 
penalized  regression  with  the  EN  regularization  method.

Stage  1:  Prescreening  SNPs  for  dimensionality  reduc-
tion:  Using  linear  regression  with  adjustments  for  sex, 
age,  and  area  (Ansan  and  Ansung),  single  SNP  associa-
tion  was  performed  for  each  SNP.  In  this  analysis,  an 
additive  genetic  mode  based  on  a  minor  allele  for  a  var-
iant  was  considered.  From  the  results,  a  subset  of  SNPs 
that  had  a  strong  association  with  the  trait  were  se-
lected  for  dimensionality  reduction.  In  our  analysis,  we 
chose  1000  SNPs.
Stage  2:  Joint  identification  of  putative  causal  SNPs  via 
EN  regularization  method:  Under  the  multiple  linear  re-
gression  frameworks,  putative  trait-related  SNPs  were 
identified  via  the  EN  variable  selection  method  proposed 
by  Zou  and  Hastie  (2010):

the  trait  value,  sex,  age,  area,  the  number  of  minor  al-
leles  for  the  ith  SNP  marker,  and  the  measurement  error 
of  the  jth  individual,  respectively; i=1,…,  p,  and  p  is  the

note  the  overall  mean,  the  effect  sizes  of  the  corre-
sponding  covariates,  and  effect  sizes  of  the  SNPs, 
respectively.  EN  regularization 
is  particularly  useful 
where  the  number  of  highly  correlated  predictor  varia-
bles  is  much  larger  than  the  sample  size  (n＜＜p).  EN 
regularization  solves  the  following  problem:

    with  another  tuning  parameter,  α.  The  EN  penalty  cre-
ates  a  useful  compromise  between  the  ridge  (α=0)  (Le 
Cessi  and  Van  Houwelingen,  1992)  and  LASSO  (α=1) 
(Tibshirani,  1996)  penalties.  The  EN  with  α=1-δ for 
some  small  δ＞0  performs  in  a  manner  similar  to 
LASSO  but  is  robust  for  extreme  correlations  among 
predictor  variables.  Since  EN  regularization  performs 
both  shrinkage  and  automatic  variable  selection  simulta-
neously,  parsimonious  model  selection  is  possible.  The 
choice  of  the  tuning  parameters  is  critical  for  selecting 
important  variables  with  accurate  estimation.  The  tuning 
parameter  λ controls  the  strength  of  the  penalty,  which 
shrinks  each  coefficient  toward  the  origin  and  enforces 
a  sparse  solution.  Cross-validation  (e.g.  10-fold)  is  gen-
erally  employed  to  find  the  best  values  of  λ and  α, 
which  minimize  the  mean-squared  prediction  error.
    To  investigate  the  biological  significance  of  the  genet-
ic  variants  jointly  identified  from  the  EN  regularization 
method,  we  mapped  the  identified  SNPs  to  an  exon/in-
tron  or  within  the  5-kb  upstream/0.5-kb  downstream  re-
gions  of  known  genes  and  performed  gene  ontology 
(GO)  and  pathway  enrichment  analyses. 

Results

The  multi-stage  EN  regularization  method  was  applied 
to  the  KARE  GWAS  data  set.  In  the  first  stage,  the  in-
dividual  association  between  each  of  the  327,872  SNPs 
and  BMI  was  tested  via  linear  regression  with  adjust-
ments  for  sex,  age,  and  area.  Fig.  1  shows  the  results 
of  the  association  tests.  Seven  SNPs  in  four  loci 
reached  the  genome-wide  significant  threshold  (p-value 
＜1×10
corresponded  to  the  widely  reported  signal  in  the  FTO

gene  (Cho et al.,  2009;  Frayling et al.,  2007;  Willer et al., 
2008).  Among  the  327,872  SNPs,  the  top  1000  SNPs 
showing  the  strongest  associations  were  selected  for 
the  next  stage.  In  the  next  stage,  a  total  of  511  SNPs 
were  jointly  identified  as  putative  BMI-related  genetic 
variants  by  the  EN  regularization  method. 
    Among  them,  254  SNPs  were  mapped  to  189  genes. 
Of  these  genes,  9  genes  had  been  reported  to  affect 
human  obesity  variation,  including  BMI,  weight,  and  hip 
circumference,  in  a  previous  GWAS  (Cho  et al.,  2009; 
Cotsapas et al.,  2009;  Frayling et al.,  2007;  Heard-Costa 
et al.,  2009;  Hinney et al.,  2007;  Kiel et al.,  2007;  Loos

2007;  Thorleifsson et al.,  2008;  Willer et al.,  2008)  (Table 
1).  Our  identification  also  included  three  SNPs  that  had 
been  reported  to  be  associated  with  BMI  and  waist-hip 
ratio  (WHR)  in  the  Korean  population  (Cho et al.,  2009).
    Finally,  a  GO  enrichment  analysis  of  189  genes  was 
performed.  All  GO  terms  that  were  related  to  the  identi-
fied  genes  were  searched  via  the  DAVID  functional  an-
notation  tool.  Then,  the  EASE  software  tool  (Hosack et 
al.,  2003)  was  used  to  calculate  the  over-representation 
statistic  and  its  EASE  score  for  each  of  the  searched 
GO  terms.  Over-represented  GO  terms  were  significantly 
detected  with  a  p-value＜0.05  and  were  presented  via 
hierarchical  clustering  with  a  dissimilarity  matrix,  defined 
similarly  in  Kosiol et al.  (Kosiol et al.,  2008).  The  GO  en-

richment  analysis  of  189  genes  showed  that  several  bio-
logical  processes  were  significantly  enriched;  they  in-
cluded  cell  migration,  metabolic  process,  transport,  and 
protein  processes  (Fig.  2). 
    In  addition,  based  on  the  KEGG  pathway  database, 
two  pathways  were  found  to  be  enriched  in  these  189 
genes:  the  endocytosis  and  axon  guidance  pathways 
(Table  2).  First,  the  endocytosis  pathway  regulates  many 
processes,  including  nutrient  uptake,  cell  adhesion  and 
migration,  receptor  signaling,  pathogen  entry,  neuro-
transmission,  growth,  and  differentiation  (Miaczynska 
and  Stenmark,  2007).  This  pathway  is  related  with  the 
receptor-mediated  endocytosis  of 
ligands,  such  as 
low-density  lipoprotein  and  growth  factors.  In  addition, 
caveolae,  one  of  four  subcategories  of  this  pathwayare 
enriched  in  membrane  proteins  such  as  a  cholester-
ol-binding  protein  and  glycolipids.  Second,  axon  guid-
ance,  which  represents  key  steps  of  formation  of  the 
neural  network,  contains  fivegenes:  ABLIM1,  PLXNC1, 
PLXNA2,  SRGAP3,  and  SRGAP1.  Das  and  Rao  (2007) 
reported  that  genes  involved  in  the  axon  guidance  path-
way  were  upregulated  in  subjects  with  type  2  diabetes 
with  a  family  history  of  diabetes  compared  to  those  who 
are  diabetic  (Das  and  Rao,  2007). 

Discussion

Most  genome-wide  association  studies  have  reported 
genetic  variants  that  are  associated  with  common  com-
plex  traits  via  single-marker  approaches.  From  this  sin-
gle  SNP  approach,  many  genetic  variants  have  been 
successfully  identified.  However,  it  would  be  hard  to 
identify  polygenic  factors  through  a  single  SNP  approach. 
Additionally,  the  single  SNP  approach  does  not  take  the 
LD  structure  into  account.  Most  multiple  comparison 
procedures,  such  as  Bonferroni  correction  and  false  dis-
covery  rate  (FDR)  (Abdi,  2007;  Benjamini  and  Hochberg, 
1995),  employed  in  GWA  studies  assume  independence 
among  the  tests.  However,  this  assumption  does  not 
hold  in  the  presence  of  an  LD.  Thus,  it  is  hard  to  identi-
fy  variants  with  moderate  effects,  even  with  multiplicity 
corrections.
    In  this  paper,  we  conducted  association  studies  for 
BMI  from  Korean  GWA  data  via  the  EN  regularization 

method  proposed  by  Cho et al.  (2010).  The  EN  regulari-
zation  method  facilitated  the  joint  detection  of  multiple 
genetic  factors  and  hence  seemed  well  suited  for  the 
GWA  analysis  of  common  complex  traits.  The  EN  regu-
larization  method  has  the  following  advantages.  First,  it 
tends  to  provide  more  reliable  identification  of  multiple 
SNPs  than  ordinary  multiple  regression,  because  ordi-
nary  regression  is  very  sensitive  to  multicollinearity  due 
to  LD  among  the  SNPs.  In  the  presence  of  multi-
collinearity,  the  coefficients  of  multiple  regression  be-
come  unstable  with  large  variances.  However,  by  com-
bining  ridge  and  LASSO  penalties,  EN  can  select  varia-
bles  more  effectively  and  obtain  more  stable  estimates 
for  high  dimensional  problems. 
    In  single-marker  analysis,  seven  SNPs  in  four  loci 
passed  the  significance  level  (p-value＜1×10
two  SNPs  were  reported  in  Cho et al.  (2009).  However, 
through  the  EN  regularization  method,  we  identified  189 
genes  associated  with  BMI,  of  which  six  genes  were  re-
ported  in  other  studies  (Cho  et al.,  2009;  Cotsapas  et 
al.,  2009;  Kiel et al.,  2007;  Lowe et al.,  2009;  Sabatti et 
al.,  2009;  Thorleifsson  et al.,  2008).  From  these  jointly 
identified  genes,  gene  ontology  and  pathway  enrichment 
analyses  were  further  conducted  for  more  meaningful  bi-
ological  interpretation.
    Although  we  conducted  an  association  study  with 
quantitative  traits,  the  EN  method  can  be  applied  to  bi-
nary  traits,  such  as  hypertension,  or  data,  such  as  the 
number  of  epileptic  seizures.  Furthermore,  the  EN  meth-
od  can  be  applied 
identify  gene-gene  and/or 
gene-environment  interactions.
