Genetic epidemiology studies have established that the natural variation of gene expression profiles is heritable and has 
genetic bases. A number of proximal and remote DNA variations, known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), that are 
associated with the expression phenotypes have been identified, first in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell 
lines and later expanded to other cell and tissue types. Integration of the eQTL information and the network analysis of 
transcription modules may lead to a better understanding of gene expression regulation. As these network modules have 
relevance to biological or disease pathways, these findings may be useful in predicting disease susceptibility.

Keywords: cis-acting, co-expression network, disease susceptibility, expression quantitative trait loci, trans-acting

Introduction

Genetic epidemiology is the study of the role of genetic 
factors in determining health and disease in families and in 
populations and the interplay of such genetic factors with 
environmental  factors  [1].  Depending  on  the  number  of 
genetic  factors  that  contribute  to  pathogenicity,  genetic 
diseases  are  categorized  into  two  classes.  A  so-called 
monogenic  disorder  is  usually  caused  by  a  single  gene 
mutation and has been the subject of intense gene hunting 
studies using familial linkages, totaling to more than 4,000 
diseases being linked to causal mutations [2]. Completion of 
the Human Genome Project expedited the studies of not only 
monogenic diseases but also complex diseases. The latter, 
also  called  polygenic  or  multifactorial  diseases,  are  con-
tributed by a number of genetic factors of relatively smaller 
effects. Unlike monogenic disorders that often affect only a 
small portion of a population and are consequently rarely 
observed, polygenic diseases are usually frequently observed 
in  a  population  and  are  also  termed  common  diseases. 
Chronic  diseases,  such  as  cancer,  diabetes,  hypertension, 
and so on, belong to this category. 

The Human Genome Project paved the way to cataloging 
common variants in the human genome. The International 
HapMap  Project  is  a  global  collaboration  to  map  single- 

nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  the  human  genome 
and to construct haplotype maps that show which allele of a 
locus  co-occur  with  which  allele  of  another  locus.  Using 
three representative continental populations－that is, Afri-
cans, Europeans, and Asians－the international consortium 
cataloged  roughly  1  SNP  for  every  300  bp  of  the  human 
genome.  The  information  of  position,  frequency,  and 
correlation structure, called linkage disequilibrium of these 
SNPs, has enabled us to design high-density SNP chips that 
can measure the genotypes of fractions of those SNPs all at 
once and infer the genetic make-up of the major portion of 
the whole genome. Using these chips, genotypes of families 
or  unrelated  populations  are  measured,  and  the  loci  dis-
playing statistically significantly different frequency patterns 
between disease-affected and unaffected groups are sought. 
Individuals harboring such alleles may have a higher or lower 
disease susceptibility than control groups. Scanning genome- 
wide  associations  of  genotype-phenotype  relationships  is 
called  a genome-wide association study  (GWAS) and has 
become  extremely  popular,  reporting  more  than  1,000 
papers within the last 5-6 years [3], probably due to the 
hypothesis-free nature of its study design. While GWASs 
have been applied to studies of disease gene hunting, they 
are also well suited to interrogating genes affecting heritable 
phenotypes,  such  as  height,  obesity,  plasma  glucose

(eQTLs). 

Fig.  1.  The  concept  of  expression 
If 
quantitative 
transcript abundance depends on the
genotype  of  a  genomic  locus,  such 
a  region  is  called  an  eQTL.  If  an 
eQTL  is  found  inside  or  near  the 
boundary  of  the  target  gene,  it  is 
classified as cis-regulatory (A); other-
wise, it is trans-regulatory (B). In the
latter case, the expression level of a
target  gene  is  not  regulated  by  its 
cis-eQTL  but  through  a  regulator, 
such  as  a  transcription  factor  (TF), 
whose expression is regulated by its 
cis-element.

concentration,  blood  pressure,  bone  density,  and  so  on. 
Unlike disease studies where samples are segregated into 
case  and  control  groups,  these  phenotypes  display  a 
continuous spectrum of values in normal populations. For s
uch a quantitative trait, its statistical correlation with the 
genotypes  within  a  population  is  sought,  instead  of 
dichotomizing the samples into case and control groups. The 
genomic loci that show correlations with such a trait are 
called quantitative trait loci (QTLs). 

The Concept of Expression QTLs

According to the current estimate, the human genome 
harbors  around  22,000  genes  and  200,000  mRNA 
transcripts  [4].  One  way  that  variations  in  the  genomic 
sequence can exert  phenotypic differences is through the 
alteration of structure and function of the gene products. 
Genetic variation may also result in changes in the expres-
sion levels of products and, thereby, their activities. Since 
most SNPs identified through GWASs do change the amino 
acid  sequence  of  a  protein,  large  portions  of  the  genetic 
variation may be regulatory in nature. Differences in gene 
expression profiles between individuals then become mole-
cular  and  intermediate  phenotypes  that  in  turn  induce 
changes in higher-order disease traits [5]. In fact, Cheung et 
al.  [6]  observed  some  genes  showing  markedly  different 
expression  levels  between  individuals  and  familial  ag-
gregation of expression phenotypes. In their follow-up study 
using 14 large families, they also identified approximately 
1,000  expression  phenotypes  that  showed  significant 
evidence  of  linkage  to  specific  chromosomal  regions  [7]. 
Dixon et al. [8] also observed heritable expression patterns 

Fig.  2.  Comparison  of  average  expression  levels  of  all  genes 
between two ethnic groups. The expression profile datasets of the 
International  HapMap  populations  (European  [CEU]  and  African 
[YRI])  measured  in  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines  were  downloaded 
from  Gene  Expression  Omnibus  (GEO  accession  no.  GSE6536). 
For each of the 19,723 genes, the log-transformed expression levels
of both 60 YRI and 60 CEU individuals were averaged and plotted

in about 30% of the genes and transcripts of their probes and 
identified the genomic regions where the genotypes were 
associated  with  those  expression  phenotypes.  These  are 
termed expression QTL (eQTL) and can be proximal (cis) or 
distal (trans) to the gene of expression variation (Fig. 1). 
Other species also show eQTL. For example, eQTLs have 
been observed in recombinant inbred mouse strains [9-11], 
yeast [12, 13], and plants [14].

The B-lymphoblastoid cell lines established by the Inter-
national HapMap Project provide invaluable resources for 
the study of eQTL: for these samples, matched genotypes

and  expression  profiles  are  publicly  available.  It  is  well 
known that genome-wide genotype profiles have the power 
to  discriminate  continental  populations.  Principal  com-
ponent analysis of the genotypes of the HapMap populations 
clearly clusters the individuals according to their population 
origins  [15].  On  the  other  hand,  it  appears  that  the 
population difference in expression levels is negligible [16] 
or  very  small  [17].  For  example,  the  expression  levels 
averaged over each population are highly correlated between 
populations (Fig. 2). Apparently, the within-group expres-
sion  variance  is  much  larger  than  the  between-group 
variance.  This  is  perhaps  due  to  the  fact  that  unlike 
genotypes that can drift somewhat freely without functional 
alteration, gene expression levels are tightly regulated by 
complex  genetic  programs.  Instead  of  focusing  on  po-
pulation differences in expression levels, intense effort has 
been made to cataloging eQTLs and classifying them into cis 
and  trans.  For  example,  using  the  HapMap  samples  of 
European and African ancestry, Duan et al. [18] found about 
5,000 expression quantitative nucleotides (eQTNs) in each 
population. They used 4 Mb of distance between the gene 
and  SNP  as  the  criteria  for  classifying  local  and  distant 
eQTNs and observed that genes harboring distant eQTNs 
were  enriched  with  functions,  like  transmembrane  signal 
transduction, implying roles in gene expression regulation 
[18]. Stranger et al. [17] used all 270 HapMap samples to 
identify at least 1,348 and 180 genes showing cis and trans 
association  signals,  respectively.  Their  result  is  in  sharp 
contrast to the previous estimate that counts most eQTLs as 
trans rather than cis [7]. Veyrieras et al. [19] reanalyzed the 
HapMap  data  using  a  sophisticated  Bayesian  hierarchical 
model to resolve the eQTLs at a fine scale: most eQTLs lay 
either within genes or close to genes (<20 kb); eQTLs were 
enriched  around  transcription  start  sites  and  250  bp 
upstream of transcription end sites, and exons were more 
likely to be eQTLs than introns. Their finding of enriched 
eQTLs upstream of transcription end sites is interesting, in 
that this site is related to post-transcriptional control and 
mRNA  stability.  This  underscores  the  important  role  of 
mRNA  stability  besides  transcription  initiation  in  deter-
mining steady-state mRNA levels [19].

Allele-Specific Expression

The presence of cis-acting eQTLs for a gene implies that 
these  alleles  have  different  transcription  levels  or  allele- 
specific expression. The typical microarray chips designed 
for  expression  measurement  do  not  usually  distinguish 
minute  sequence  differences  of  the  SNP  alleles  residing 
within a transcript. One can infer the allele-specific expres-
sion using statistical tests that model the expression levels of 

a gene with the number of minor alleles at each locus. On the 
other hand, by hybridizing the transcripts onto SNP chips or 
directly  sequencing  the  transcripts,  one  can  validate  the 
allele-specific  expression.  Ge  et  al.  [20]  used  Illumina 
Human 1M Beadchips to measure allele-specific expression 
in  53  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines  derived  from  European 
descendants. With the advent of next-generation sequencing 
technologies, RNA-seq has become popular and has been 
applied to detecting allele-specific expression. Pickrell et al. 
[21]  sequenced  RNA  from  69  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines 
derived from unrelated African individuals who participated 
in the International HapMap Project, discovering a number 
of  eQTLs  involved  in  allele-specific  expression  or  allele- 
specific splicing.

Tissue-Dependent eQTLs

So  far,  most  eQTL  studies  have  examined  expression- 
genotype relations in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Since many 
genes display tissue-specific expression patterns, one may 
argue  that  the  expression-genotype  relations  observed  in 
Epstein-Barr  virus-transformed  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines 
may not be preserved in other tissues or cell types. Gerrits et 
al. [22] observed that eQTLs were quite different, depending 
on  the  differentiation  status  of  the  cells,  suggesting 
uncommon functional regulatory networks among different 
cell types. Nica et al. [23] compared cis-regulatory eQTLs 
from  three  different  tissues  of  co-twin  samples  from  the 
MuTHER  project  (http://www.muther.ac.uk/),  observing 
30% shared eQTLs, 29% exclusively tissue-specific eQTLs, 
and substantial differences in expression levels in different 
tissues. In addition to the similar proportion of exclusively 
tissue-specific  cis-regulatory  eQTLs  from  five  different 
tissues,  Fu  et  al.  [24]  also  observed  many  examples  of 
alternative regulation, where a gene is cis-associated with 
different SNPs, depending on the tissue. If one were to use 
eQTL information in predicting disease susceptibility, it is 
thus  imperative  to  understand  expression-genotype  rela-
tions in the tissue of interest, not just in lymphoblastoid cell 
lines [25]. When transcript expression levels were measured 
in  adipose  tissues  as  well  as  blood  in  large  population 
cohorts,  unlike  expression  profiles  in  blood,  a  marked 
correlation between expression levels in adipose tissues and 
obesity-related traits was observed [26]. Schadt et  al. [5] 
observed  over  6,000  associations  between  genotypes  and 
expression in 400 human liver samples to understand the 
genetic architecture of gene expression in the human liver, a 
metabolically important tissue involved in various common 
diseases,  such  as  obesity,  cancer,  diabetes,  and  athero-
sclerosis.

Network-Based Understanding of eQTLs

We have reviewed above that natural variation in gene 
expression is substantial and heritable. Genetic analyses of 
expression  phenotypes  have  identified  cis-  and  trans- 
associated loci, culminating in our understanding of gene 
expression regulation. One should understand that not all 
genes showing natural variation are regulated by either cis- or 
trans-eQTLs.  For  example,  genes  downstream  of  eQTL- 
regulated  genes  in  a  regulatory  network  may  also  show 
natural  variation.  If  they  are  regulated  primarily  by  a 
regulator, their expression profile may resemble that of the 
regulator.  On  the  other  hand,  if  multiple  regulators  are 
involved, the downstream target genes may show complex 
expression profiles that may look independent of those of 
the  regulators.  Integrating  the  bioinformatic  learning  of 
regulatory  programs  and  genetic  analysis  of  cis-  and 
trans-acting  DNA  variants  may  lead  to  a  better  under-
standing of gene expression regulation [27]. Nayak et al. [28] 
constructed co-expression networks based on the HapMap 
expression  profiles  of  African,  European,  and  Asian 
ancestries, discovering that the subnetwork structures are 
not random but relevant to biological pathways or disease 
susceptibility.  This  implies  that  genes  are  regulated  by  a 
common  set  of  regulatory  modules  and  that  the  variable 
activity of the modules due to genetic variation can result in 
clustered expression profiles of the target genes. Li et al. [9], 
using  32  recombinant  inbred  mouse  strains,  reported  29 
transcription  modules  and  their  associations  with  18 
classical  physiological  and  behavioral  traits,  possibly 
through eQTLs.

Discussion

Individual  variation  in  gene  expression  levels  may  be 
influenced  by  environmental  and  genetic  factors.  A  sub-
stantial proportion of the variation is heritable and thus has 
a  genetic  basis.  Based  on  studies  on  population-level 
genotype-expression  data,  it  is  now  well  established  that 
DNA  variations  affect  the  expression  levels  of  nearby  or 
remote genes. Since the genotype data used in these studies 
were mostly measured on commercial SNP chip platforms of 
common variants, the causal eQTLs must be probed SNPs or 
located within the linkage disequilibrium blocks tagged by 
the probed SNPs. Whatever the case is, one may wonder 
whether  those  eQTLs  evolved  neutrally  without  any 
selection  pressure  or  whether  they  were  the  result  of 
selection over human population history. The co-expression 
network  study  by  Nayak  et  al.  [28]  indicated  that  the 
subnetworks  are  modular  and  coherent  in  biological 
functions. It is very unlikely that such network structures 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  4,  2012

were  derived  as  the  result  of  random  drift  in  genomic 
variations. It is also interesting that evolutionary selection 
operated on a network or pathway level. Although they must 
have occurred gene by gene, the whole sum of the variations 
has  biological  themes.  If  the  activity  of  the  pathways  is 
variable between normal individuals, it has an implication in 
predicting disease susceptibility. As the subjects probed by 
gene  expression  profiling  are  normal  individuals,  the 
variations of the pathway activity may not be large enough to 
trigger  diseases.  Nevertheless,  they  may  predispose  the 
genetic  background  of  an  individual  to  be  susceptible  or 
resistant to certain diseases. For example, individuals having 
slightly diminished immune pathway activities may have a 
high  tendency  of  contracting  infectious  diseases  or  other 
immune-related diseases. The next challenge would then be 
the experimental validation of this hypothesis.
