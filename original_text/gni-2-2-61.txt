Abstract 
Fusion  proteins  resulting  from  chimeric sequences  are 
excellent targets for therapeutic drug development. We 
developed  a  database  of  chimeric  sequences  by 
examining  the  genomic  alignment  of  mRNA  and  EST 
sequences in  the GenBank. We  identified 688 chimeric 
mRNA and  20,998 chimeric  EST sequences.  Including 
EST sequences greatly expands the scope of chimeric 
sequences even though it inevitably accompanies many 
artifacts. Chimeric sequences are clustered according to 
the ECgene ID so that the user can easily find  chimeric 
sequences  related  to  a  specific  gene.  Alignments  of 
chimeric sequences  are  displayed  as  custom  tracks  in 
the  UCSC  genome  browser.  ChimerDB,  available  at 
http:llgenome.ewha.ac.kr!ECgene/ChimerDBI,  should 
be  a valuable  resource  for finding  drug  targets  to  treat 
cancers.

Introduction 
Chromosomal  translocation  is  frequently  observed  in 
many  hematologic and  solid  tumors  (Mitelman,  2000).  It 
can affect the gene expression by disrupting the promoter 
region  of the gene or by joining the  gene with  enhancer 
elements  like  immunoglobulin  or  T-cell  receptor  genes 
(Croce et al., 1984). However, chromosomal translocation 
in tumors frequently creates a chimeric mRNA sequence 
encoding  a  fusion  protein  that  interferes  the  normal

regulating pathways (Mitelman, 2000). The most famous 
example  is  the  fusion  protein  BCR-ABL,  which  is  the 
target protein of the drug Gleevec treating CML, chronic 
myeloid leukemia (Mauro and Druker, 2001 ). 

translocation.  The 

CML is associated in most cases with a chromosomal 
translocation  between  chromosomes  9  and  22  that 
creates the Philadelphia chromosome. The BCR gene in 
chr22 is fused  with the gene ABL in  chr9,  so called  the 
t(9;22)(q34;q11) 
tyrosine  kinase 
activity of ABL is constantly activated by the BCR gene 
(GTPase activator) in the fusion  protein,  resulting in the 
rapid cellular mitosis and  inability of the cell to  perform 
apoptosis.  Gleevec inhibits the tyrosine kinase ability of 
the BCR-ABL fusion. Gleevec is revolutionary because it 
proved that molecular targeting works in treating cancer 
if the  target  is  correctly chosen.  In  AML(acute  myeloid 
leukemia)  patients,  the  RUNX1  gene  (also  known  as 
AML 1 or CBFA2) is among the most frequent targets of 
chromosomal  rearrangements 
leukemias 
(Mikhail  eta/.,  2004).  More  than  20  cases  have  been 
observed  by  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH) 
analysis (Mikhail eta/., 2002). 

in  human 

Given  the  success  of  Gleevec  and  the  recent 
explosion of genomic data, it is quite plausible to search 
the GenBank database looking for chimeric sequences. 
Fusion  proteins  from  chimeric  mRNAs  may  serve  as 
excellent  drug  targets  in  other  tumors.  Function  and 
expression  analyses  of  resultant  fusion  proteins  are 
essential  to  find  better  targets  as  can  be  seen  in  the 
example  of  the  BCR-ABL  case,  the  combination  of 
activator and  kinase domains. 

Chimeric  sequences  can  be  generated  from  other 
mechanisms.  Trans-splicing can join two independently 
transcribed  mRNA sequences  at  canonical  exon-exon 
in  vitro 
borders.  Trans-splicing  was  first  detected 
(Sol nick,  1985), but subsequently shown to occur in vivo 
in  eukaryotes (Bonen,  1993) and  mammals (Caudevilla 
et  a/.,  1998).  Even  though  natural  trans-splicing  of 
pre-mRNAs  has  been  regarded  to  be  a  rare  event  in 
mammals, human estrogen receptor-a  gene is shown to 
be  trans-spliced  in  addition  to  alternative  cis-splicing 
(Fiouriot eta/., 2002). 

Long  transcription  across  neighboring  genes  that 
normally act as independent transcription units has been 
demonstrated  in  several  cases.  Cotranscription  and 
intergenic splicing lead to a fusion  mRNA.  Even though 

62  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  2(2) 61-66, June 2004 

its role is not known, it certainly increases the diversity of 
the exon  complement of the participating genes,  which 
may contribute to gene evolution (Communi eta/., 2001; 
Finta and Zaphiropoulos, 2000). 

Alberti  and  coworkers  developed  a  screening 
procedure  (ISTReS; 
in  silica  trans-splicing  retrieval 
system)  to  identify  heterologous,  spliced  mRNAs  with 
potential  origin  from  chromosomal  translocation,  mRNA 
trans-splicing, and multi-locus transcription (Romani eta/., 
2003). mRNA sequences are aligned onto the genome by 
BLAST,  and  applied  several  criteria  for  filtering  and 
validation.  EST  sequences  were  discarded  since  the 
transcript direction is not annotated in many cases. 

EST  sequence  data  increases  the  transcriptome 
diversity  significantly.  For  example,  61  % of transcript 
variants due to alternative splicing are supported only by 
EST sequences.  Furthermore, gene expression pattern 
can  be 
inferred  by  examining  the  eDNA  libraries 
comprising  EST  sequences.  The  NCI's CGAP  (cancer 
genome  anatomy  project)  is  a  major  source  of public 
EST  sequences,  and  59%  of human  eDNA libraries  in 
the dbEST are related to cancers. Therefore, we believe 
that EST sequence data is too valuable to be discarded 
especially when  the  purpose  of searching  for  chimeric 
sequences is finding drug targets to  treat cancers.  The 
problem of uncertain read  direction can  be alleviated by 
using the genome-based EST clustering procedures as 
in the UniGene or the ECgene. 

In  this  paper,  we  describe  a  new  publicly  available 
database of chimeric sequences  - ChimerDB- and the 
associated navigator tools.  Its coverage is substantially 
larger than  the  ISTReS  result  because  all  mRNA and 
EST sequences in the GenBank are included. 

Methods 
Datasets 
We  used  the  July  2003  human  reference  sequence 
(UCSC  version  hg16) that  is  based  on  NCBI  Build  34. 
The genome sequence was downloaded from the UCSC 
genome  center.  mRNA  and  ESTs  sequences  are 
obtained from NCBI  GenBank release 138 (October 15, 
2003).  ESTs  in  gbestNN.seq  and  mRNAs  in  gbhtcNN. 
seq  and  gbpriNN.seq  were  extracted.  ECgene version 
1.1  based  on  hg16  is  used  throughout  this  work. 
Reference  sequences  were  not  used  since  their  build 
procedure specifically removes chimeric sequences. 

Algorithm 

mRNA  and  EST  sequences  were  aligned  onto  the 
human genome using the  BLAT program  (Kent,  2002). 

imposed 

likely  to  derive  from 

We  used the alignments whose percent identity is over 
93%.  BLAT output may contain  many overlapping  hits. 
Segments  whose  overlap  :<::::  16  bp  are  treated  as 
independent  alignments.  The 
longest  alignment  is 
chosen  among  dependent  alignments.  We  kept 
chimeras  with  two  independent  segments  since  other 
chimeras  were 
the  random 
co-ligation  of  unrelated  eDNA  fragments.  To  retain 
reliable  chimeric  sequences,  we 
three 
additional  conditions  -
( 1)  the  small  segment  should 
cover over 20% of the sequence, (2) the large segments 
should  cover  less  than  80%  of the  sequence,  and  (3) 
aligned  sequences  from  the  two  segments  should  be 
over 80% of the entire sequence. Segments in the same 
chromosome  should  be  separated  farther than  1 Mbp. 
Any alignment on chromosome M and random assembly 
was  discarded.  As  a  final  step,  each  segment  should 
have  more  than  30  bp  overlap  with  an  ECgene  gene 
model.  Since the  ECgene  is  based  on  clustering  EST 
sequences  of  high  quality,  this  removes  unreliable 
chimeras  from  intergenic  or  intronic  region  of  the 
genome.  Resultant  chimeric  sequences  are  grouped 
according to the ECgene ID of constituent segments. 

Results and Discussion 
ChimerDB Website 
The contents of the chimeric sequence database can be 
accessed  at  the  ChimerDB  website,  http://genome. 
ewha.ac.kr/ECgene!ChimerDB. Figure 1 is the summary 
table of chimeric sequences.  Chromosome 22 contains 
573  ECgene  clusters  overlapping  with  at  least  one 
chimeric sequence. The table shows number of chimeric 
mRNA  and  EST  sequences.  It  should  be  noted  that 
many  chimeric  relationships  are  supported  by  EST 
sequences only as can  be seen in the second and third 
columns.  Since  the  ECgene  contains  many  putative 
genes with no known RefSeq, we provide the number of 
RefSeq,  mRNA,  and  EST  sequences  to  aid  user's 
decision on  reliability of the gene.  Clicking  the ECgene 
ID  shows  more  detailed  information  of  the  ECgene 
cluster. 

The  BCR  gene  (H22C1443)  contains  12  chimeric 
mRNA  and  3  chimeric  ESTs,  and  they  generate  four 
different fusion genes as listed in the last two columns. In 
addition  to  the  well-known  ABL 1 gene,  we  have  three 
fusion  partners  - SLU7,  MTHFS, and  FGFR1.  Clicking 
on  'R123' shows detailed  information on  each  chimeric 
sequence as shown  in  Figure 2.  The table summarizes 
how  the  constituent  genes  align  on 
the  chimeric 
sequence. It also shows which genes are joined in each 

ChimerDB - Database of Chimeric Sequences in the GenBank  63 

chimeric sequence. The alignment information is helpful 
in assessing the reliability of the chimeric sequence. For 
example,  two  EST  sequences  (BF380221,  BF094682) 
giving  the  BCR-SLU7  fusion  gene,  contain  unaligned 
nucleotides in  the  range of 162-187 bp.  Both  ESTs are 
from the same library of uterus-tumor tissue. All chimeric 
mRNA sequences generate the BCR-ABL 1 fusion gene, 

and  most of them  (except AB069693)  have contiguous 
alignments between the two segments. 

We also  provide  a viewer for  genomic alignment  of 
the  chimeric  sequences.  Clicking  on  the  ECgene  ID 
(H22C1443)  in  Figure  2  opens  a  genome  browser  as 
shown  in  Figure 3.  It  shows the  ECgene structure and 
alignments  of  chimeric  sequences  as  custom  tracks.

Fig.  1.  Summary  page  of chimer  relationships  in  chromosome  22.  Chimeric  sequences  are  clustered  according  to 
overlapping  ECgene ID.  For example,  the entry R123 contains chimeric sequences related  to the  ECgene H22C1443, 
which comprises 3 RefSeq,  17  mRNA,  and  348  EST sequences.  It represents the  BCR gene on  chromosome 22.  The 
second and third column  means that there are  12 chimeric mRNA and  3 chimeric EST sequences overlapping with the 
ECgene H22C1443. Clicking on  ECgene ID show the summary page of corresponding ECgene. The last column shows 
the counterpart genes constituting the chimeric sequence in case official gene symbols are available.

Fig. 2. Detailed information on chimeric sequences related to the ECgene H22C1443 (BCR). We have 12 chimeric mRNA 
and 3 chimeric EST sequences, and the table summarizes the alignment of all segment pairs. For example, the third entry 
is about the chimeric mRNA AJ131466 which  is 997 bp long.  Nucleotides 0-373 bp of this mRNA aligns on  H22C1443, 
whereas  nucleotides  373-997  bp  of this  mRNA  maps  onto  H9C11979  (ABL 1)  gene.  EST  sequences  are  classified 
according to pathology codes,  normal or neoplasia.

Fig. 3. Genome browser for viewing genomic alignment of chimeric sequences. ECgene models and chimeric alignments 
are  added  as  custom  tracks  in  the  UCSC  human  genome  browser.  The  ID of each  chimeric sequence contains  brief 
information on alignment. For example, 'AJ298917[m, 1 07-324;324]' implies that this sequence is an mRNA (324 bp long) 
whose  nucleotides ranging107-324  bp align  onto the BCR gene as displayed  in  the  browser.  Putative breakpoints  are 
indicated with block arrows. Alignment of chimeric sequences is magnified in the inset picture. 

ECgene  structure  includes  transcript  variants  due  to 
alternative splicing.  Genomic alignment of the  chimeric 
sequence  often  reveals  the  location  of  breakpoint  in 
chromosomal  translocation.  We  find  three  candidate 
breakpoints for the BCR-ABL fusion mRNA, indicated as 
block arrows in  the picture.  Chromosomal translocation 
in  the  Philadelphia  chromosome  seems  to  happen 
frequently near the third breakpoint since several spliced 
chimeric mRNAs appear in  that region.  Another benefit 
of  genomic  alignment  is  that  we  can  examine  the 
character of the fusion  boundary.  The enlarged  view in 
the  inset picture shows that the  two ESTs inferring the 
BCR-SLU7 have different alignment from other chimeric 

sequences.  The last exon  aligns in the  intron  region  of 
the  gene,  which  strongly  suggests  artifactual  origin  of 
two  chimeric  sequences.  Clicking  on  the  partner gene 
(e.g.  ABL 1 gene,  H9C11979) in  Figure 2 shows similar 
tables and pictures for the partner gene. 

Statistics of ChimerDB 
We identified 688 chimeric mRNA and  20,998 chimeric 
EST  sequences.  The  number  of  chimeric  mRNAs  is 
approximately 0.6% of 118,034 BLAT-aligned  mRNAs. 
-0.4  %  of  4,838,878 
Chimeric  ESTs  comprise 
BLAT-aligned  EST  sequences.  The  ratio  of  chimeric 
ESTs  is  smaller than  that of mRNA probably  because 

ChimerDB - Database of Chimeric Sequences in the GenBank  65 

short EST sequences have less chance of containing the 
fusion  boundary  of  the  chimeric  sequence.  Chimeric 
ESTs  consist  of  4,235  5'  ESTs,  4,848  3'  ESTs,  and 
11,915 ESTs without read  direction. The raw database, 
NCBI's  dbEST,  contains  2.47  million  5'  ESTs,  1.78 
million  3'  ESTs,  and  1.18  million  undirected  ESTs. 
Portion  of ESTs without  read  direction  is  rather high  in 
chimeric  sequences,  which  may  imply  that  chimeric 
sequences would contain more artifactual sequences. 

We  found  22,834  ECgene  clusters  overlapping with 
any  of  21 ,686  chimeric  sequences.  797  ECgenes 
overlap  with  both  mRNA  and  EST  chimers.  473 
ECgenes overlap with  chimeric mRNA sequences,  and 
21 ,564  ECgene  clusters  are  related  to  chimeric  EST 
sequences  with  no  mRNA  chimers.  Even 
though 
substantial  portion  of chimeric sequences are expected 
from  the  artifacts  in  eDNA  library  construction,  it  is 
obvious that  EST data would  contribute significantly to 
the content of chimeric sequence database. 

Total number of the ECgene pairs in the ChimerDB is 
75,455.  We  have  1,685  pair  relationships  being 
supported  by  mRNA  chimers,  147  of  which  are  also 
supported  by  chimeric  EST  sequences.  Remaining 
73,764 pair relationships are supported only by chimeric 
EST  sequences.  This  may  imply  that  majority  of  EST 
chimers are from artifacts or that the coverage by EST 
sequences  is  much  wider.  It  is  too  early  to  draw  any 
conclusion at this point. 

It should be noted that 25 chimeric mRNAs, identified 
by Alberti  and  coworker in  2003,  are removed  from the 
GenBank  database  now.  Only  30  chimeric  mRNAs 
among  55  chimeric  RefSeq's  remain  in  the  database. 
This  suggests  that  NCBI's  RefSeq  project  is  putting 
substantial  efforts  to  filter  out  artifactual  chimeric 
sequences.  Even  chimeric  mRNAs  should  be  carefully 
examined for their validity. 

Conclusion 
We  constructed  a  database  of chimeric  sequences  by 
examining  the  genomic  alignment  of mRNA  and  EST 
sequences  in  the  GenBank.  Including  EST sequences 
greatly expands the scope of chimeric sequences even 
though it inevitably includes many artifactual sequences. 
Instead of discarding all  EST sequences, our strategy is 
to  filter  out  artifacts  at  later  stages.  Currently,  we  are 
implementing  another  filtering  scheme  that  selects 
chimeric sequences whose junction appears at exon-exon 
border  as  in  trans-splicing.  Function  and  expression 
analyses of resultant fusion proteins are also in progress 
to identify better targets for example, the combination of 
activator  and  kinase  domains  in  the  BCR-ABL  fusion. 

Nevertheless,  the  database  and  tools  provided  at  the 
ChimerDB site should be a valuable resource for finding 
drug targets to treat cancers.
