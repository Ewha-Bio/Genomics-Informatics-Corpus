Recently,  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  techno-
logies  have  become  the  most  important  part  of  genetic 
testing to understand life phenomena and disease mecha-
nisms. As one of the important moves towards personalized 
medicine, NGS technology is being rapidly introduced to the 
clinical field. However, considering the cost and time for the 
analysis after sequencing per se, whole-genome or whole- 
exome sequencing might not be the most efficient genetic 
testing methods yet. Regarding this issue, Dr. Byung Chul 
Kim’s group, Theragen Bio Institute, reports a fast and cost- 
effective NGS method to identify somatic mutations in lung 
cancer. They chose 30 genes potentially associated with lung 
cancer  development,  performed  target  gene  capture,  and 
analyzed the findings by NGS. This approach could be useful 
for  detecting  well-known  key  mutations  as  well  as  novel 
variants in lung cancer. Dr. Hyung Doo Shin’s group, Sogang 
University, hypothesized that polymorphisms in the tyro-
sine-protein kinase Tec, which is involved in various immune 

responses,  might  be  involved  in  aspirin-exacerbated  res-
piratory  disease pathogenesis. Although  they did  not ob-
serve a positive association, this study can help us under-
stand the genetic component of this condition. Dr. Dorairaj 
Sudarsanam’s  group,  Loyola  College,  India,  reported  the 
results of their exploration of the Gm18 and m1G37 modi-
fication positions in tRNA sequences. Dr. Satish Kumar’s 
group, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, India, 
suggested  the  molecular  interaction  of  natural  inhibitors 
with the human papillomavirus-16 E6 oncoprotein. In the 
application note section, Dr. Dong Su Yu’s group, KOBIC, 
reports a simple and fast protein function annotation sys-
tem, named SFannotation.

Genomics  &  Informatics  is  already  available  in  PubMed 
Central  and  PubMed.  Taking  these  efforts  together,  we 
expect broader international visibility of Genomics & Infor-
matics.
