We investigated the contribution of genetic variations of KLF5 to basal metabolic rate (BMR) and resting metabolic rate 
(RMR) and the inhibition of obesity in Korean children. A variation of KLF5 (rs3782933) was genotyped in 62 Korean children. 
Using multiple linear regression analysis, we developed a model to predict BMR in children. We divided them into several 
groups;  normal  versus  overweight  by  body  mass  index  (BMI)  and  low  BMR  versus  high  BMR  by  BMR.  There  were  no 
differences in the distributions of alleles and genotypes between each group. The genetic variation of KLF5 gene showed a 
significant correlation with several clinical factors, such as BMR, muscle, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin. 
Children with the TT had significantly higher BMR than those with CC (p = 0.030). The highest muscle was observed in the 
children with TT compared with CC (p = 0.032). The insulin and C-peptide values were higher in children with TT than those 
with CC (p= 0.029 vs. p = 0.004, respectively). In linear regression analysis, BMI and muscle mass were correlated with BMR, 
whereas insulin and C-peptide were not associated with BMR. In the high-BMR group, we observed that higher muscle, fat 

mass, and C-peptide affect the increase of BMR in children with TT (p ＜ 0.001, p ＜ 0.001, and p = 0.018, respectively), while 
Rohrer’s index could explain the usual decrease in BMR (adjust r2 = 1.000, p ＜ 0.001, respectively). We identified a novel 

association between TT of KLF5 rs3782933 and BMR in Korean children. We could make better use of the variation within 
KLF5 in a future clinical intervention study of obesity.

Introduction

Kruppel-like  factors  (KLFs)  are  zinc-finger  transcription 
factors considered to be crucial regulators of cell differen-
tiation, development, and cell cycle progression [1]. Each 
KLF  has  its  own  function  and  acts  as  a  transcriptional 
activator  or  repressor,  depending  on  the  promoters  [2]. 
Several features distinguish KLFs from the highly conserved 
classical zinc-finger transcription factors [2, 3]. Zinc-fingers 
are  located  at  the  carboxyl  terminus  of  the  protein  and 
permit KLFs to bind to related GC- and CACCC-boxes of 

DNA [4]. In contrast to the zinc-finger regions, the non- 
DNA-binding regions are highly controversial, regulate acti-
vation  and  repression,  and  often  mediate  interaction  of 
protein-protein [3].

Recently,  a  potential  role  for  KLFs  in  adipogenesis  has 
been  suggested  [5].  For  example,  KLF5  and  KLF2  are 
expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and bind directly to the 
peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor γ2  (PPARγ2)  pro-
moter or inhibit its activity [6]. KLF5 (also known as BTEB2 
or  IKLF)  was  first  identified  as  a  transcription  factor  for 
SMemb/non-muscle  myosin  heavy  chain-B  (NMHC-B),  a

marker of smooth muscle cells in vascular disease [7]. KLF5 
upregulates in activated smooth muscle cells or fibroblasts 
of vascular lesions and downregulates in adult vessels [7, 8] 
KLF5  binds  directly  to  the  PPARγ promoter,  and  PPARγ 
activity can be enhanced by either C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ [4]. 
Therefore, several studies suggested KLF5 is downstream of 
C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ and upstream of PPARγ during adipocyte 
differentiation [4, 5]. Just like KLF2, KLF5 might contribute 
to  adipogenesis  transcriptional  regulation  via  PPARγ. 
KLF15 induces differentiation of 3T3-L1 in the late stage and 
expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 [9]. KLF7 is 
expressed in adipocytes, as well as several human tissues, 
such as pancreas, skeletal muscle, and liver [10]. However, 
the functions of these KLFs in adipocyte differentiation in 
vivo remain unclear. 

The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing 
worldwide. The imbalance between energy expenditures and 
energy intakes causes excessive fat accumulation, leading to 
an increase of the number and/or size of fat cells [4]. Basal 
metabolic rate (BMR) is the minimum energy required to 
retain the physiological functions of the body while awake. 
BMR accounts for approximately 45% to 70% of total energy 
expenditure in most healthy adults and is affected by age, 
gender, body surface area, body composition, genetic compo-
sition,  pregnancy,  and  hormonal  status  directly  [11,  12]. 
Thus,  estimating  BMR is important  for  establishing  stra-
tegies of obesity prevention programs [11]. For several years, 
numerous  predictive  equations  for  BMR  have  been  deve-
loped in different populations. Although many studies have 
shown the influence of ethnicity on BMR, their results have 
been inconsistent [11, 12]. 

On the other hand, resting metabolic rate (RMR) is also 
the  energy  requirement  to  support  vital  functions  while 
resting in the supine position. Just like the BMR, RMR is 
quantitatively  the  largest  component  of  daily  energy 
expenditure (60‒75%). In order to evaluate RMR, direct and 
indirect  calorimeters,  such  as  whole-room  calorimeters, 
open-circuit  Douglas  bag  method,  metabolic  carts,  and 
ventilated hood systems, are required, and these methods 
are  not  helpful  nor  cost-effective  for  large-scale  epide-
miological  studies.  Therefore,  regression  equations  have 
been used to estimate resting energy requirements in large 
populations [13].     

So  far,  several  studies  have  suggested  that  uncoupling 
protein  2  (UCP2)  is  involved  in  the  regulation  of  energy 
expenditure metabolism, body weight, and obesity [14]. In 
other studies, the polymorphism of the uncoupling protein 1 
(UCP1) gene did not have an independent effect on BMR; 
however,  its  synergistic  effect  with  the  beta3-AR  gene 
polymorphism  induced  a  lower  BMR  than  the  polymor-
phism of beta3-AR gene alone [15]. Recently, to investigate 

the clinical relevance of KLF5 in complex diseases, such as 
cardiovascular  disease, several single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) within KLF5 have been analyzed; however, an 
association of KLF5 SNPs with BMR of children has not been 
identified yet. The purpose of this study is 1) to identify the 
contribution of novel genetic variations of KLF5 to increased 
BMR and the suppression of obesity in Korean children and 
2) to make better use of the alterations of KLF5 in future 
clinical intervention studies.

Methods
Study population

A  total of 62 eligible  subjects were recruited from  3rd 
grade to 6th grade students of elementary schools in 2005. 
Ethical  permission  for  the  study  was  obtained  from  the 
Institutional  Review  Boards,  and  all  subjects  provided 
written  informed  consent.  Demographics  of  age,  gender, 
weight, height, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, muscle, 
waist-hip  ratio  (WHR),  and  BMR,  as  well  as  skinfold 
thickness, lipid profile, and hematological data, were also 
recorded. All variables were measured for developing the 
predictive equation model of BMR.  

Anthropometric measurements

All measurements were made using standard techniques. 
The  standing  height  was  measured  with  a  stadiometer 
(Jenix) attached to a wall. Weight, height, fat mass, muscle 
mass, and WHR were measured by bioelectrical impedance 
analysis  (Inbody  720;  Biospace,  Seoul,  Korea).  BMI  was 
calculated by dividing weight (kg) by the square of height 
(m).  Subjects  were  divided  into  two  groups  by  the  85 
percentile of BMI values. Children with normal weight were 
the lower BMI group (BMI  ＜ 85th), and the higher BMI 
group was overweight (BMI ≥ 85th). Also, Rohrer index 
(RI) was measured by height and weight for obesity judg-
ment. Skinfold thickness of the triceps and subscapular and 
suprailiac  regions  were  measured  by  caliper  (Cambridge 
Scientific Industries, Cambridge, MD, USA). 

RMR and BMR measurements

RMR was measured using a MedGem metabolic analyzer 
(Microlife USA, Dunedin, FL, USA) [16]. This device is a 
handheld  indirect  calorimeter  used  for  its  accuracy  and 
portability in clinical settings and is becoming popular in 
research studies as a screening tool and a criterion measure 
of  RMR.  This  device  calculates  RMR  using  florescent 
quenching of ruthenium in the presence of oxygen and the 
modified  Weir  equation,  with  an  assumed  respiration 
quotient of 0.85 to estimate carbon dioxide production [17]. 
Prior to each measurement, the MedGem was autocali-

264

brated  on  zero  airflow  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions. Participants rested in the supine position on a 
dormitory  bed  with  a  pillow  for  15  min  in  a  climate- 
controlled laboratory, where lights were dimmed and the 
setting was quiet. Following this rest period, participants 
were asked to breathe through a mouthpiece in a relaxed 
fashion  for  approximately  7‒10  min,  depending  on  the 
stability of the VO2 measures. The participants were allowed 
to hold the mouthpiece in their mouth during the measure-
ment  if  they  felt  it  necessary.  Once  the  participant  had 
reached steady-state oxygen consumption, as measured by 
the MedGem, data collection was completed. If the children 
were unable to reach steady-state oxygen consumption in 
the  allotted  time  of  approximately  10  min,  the  test  was 
terminated at 10 min by the device, and RMR was calculated 
as  a  mathematical  average  from  the  final  8  min  of  data 
collection. The MedGem then calculated steady-state RMR 
for a 24-h period (kcal/day) [13]. BMR was measured using 
indirect calorimetry. All measurements were repeated three 
times. 

Blood biochemistry

Blood samples were collected after 12-h fasting and were 
immediately placed in 4oC. For genotyping, whole blood was 
collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-treated tubes. 
For other blood profiles, blood samples were collected in 
serum separator tubes and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 20 
min at 4oC. Serum samples were frozen at ‒80oC until used. 
Levels  of  total  cholesterol  (TC),  triglyceride  (TG),  high- 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B, 
apolipoprotein A1, and C-reactive protein were measured by 
an  auto  analyzer  (Boeringer  Mannheim,  Mannheim,  Ger-
many).  Low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C)  was 
calculated  as  described  by  the  Friedewald  and  Laucer 
equation [18, 19]: LDL-C = TC  ‒ HDL-C ‒ (TG/5).  Levels 
of fasting glucose were measured by using an autoanalyzer 
(Ekachem DTSC module; Johnson & Johnson, New Brun-
swick, NJ, USA). Fasting insulin was measured by gluco-
trend  (Roche,  Mannheim,  Germany),  and  homeostasis 
model  assessment  of  insulin  resistance  (HOMA-IR)  was 
calculated as described by Matthews equation [20]: HOMA- 
IR  =  fasting  glucose  (mmol/L)/22.5  ×  insulin  (μL/mL), 
fasting  glucose  (mmol/L)  =  fasting  glucose  (mg/mL)  × 
0.0555. 

Analysis of the KLF5 SNP 

The polymorphisms for the KLF5 (rs3782933) gene were 
analyzed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/). For each sample, the 
genomic  DNA  was  isolated  from  whole  blood  using  the 
QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) 
according to the supplier’s instructions. PCR was performed 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

using the Takara DNA Polymerase Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, 
Japan).  All  the  primers  for  PCR  amplification  and  DNA 
sequencing  were  designed  using  the  Primer3  software 
(http://Frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3);  the  se-
quences  are  available  upon  request.  PCR  reactions  were 
carried out in a final volume of 25 μL containing 10× buffer, 
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 20 μmol/L dNTP, 0.5 μmol/L of each 
primer,  10  ng  of  genomic  DNA  as  template,  and  0.5  U 
polymerase. Each PCR product was purified and subjected to 
DNA sequencing by using the QIAquick PCR purification 
Kit (Qiagen) and the ABI Prism genetic analyzer (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA)  after  confirming  the 
purity  and  mobility  of  each  PCR  product  by  agarose  gel 
electrophoresis.  Each  sample  was  sequenced  for  both 
strands to confirm results.

Statistical analysis

The results are presented as mean ± standard error range. 
p-values for each genotype and allele were evaluated by χ2 
analysis  and  Fisher’s  exact  test.  A  p-value  of  ＜0.05  was 
considered  to indicate  a statistically  significant difference 
between obese subjects and normal-weight subjects of the 
study. Associations of clinical variables, such as age, BMI, 
height, weight, and BMR, were analyzed by Pearson correla-
tion test. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed 
to develop a BMR equation. All analyses were performed 
using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 

Results
Distribution of genotypes and alleles of KLF5 gene

The recruited 62 children were aged 11.51 ± 0.97 y, and 
girls made up more than half of the children recruited (n = 
33, 53.2%). Mean BMI estimated from height and weight 
was 20.26 ± 3.41 kg/m2. The average BMR was 1,018.42 ± 
113.86 kcal/day, and muscle averaged 28.26 ± 4.99 kg (data 
not shown). Children with the C allele were nearly twice 
those  with  the  T  allele  in  each  group.  In  the  overweight 
group, allele frequencies were 67.6% for C allele and 32.4% 
for T allele. However, we found no statistical significance 
between  the  frequencies  of  alleles  and  genotypes  in  two 
groups (Table 1). On the other hand, four children had TT 
genotype in the high-BMR group and only one child had TT 
genotype in the low-BMR group. Thus, four in five children 
with  the  TT  genotype  belong  to  the  high-BMR  group. 
However, there were no differences of alleles and genotypes 
in the low- and high-BMR groups (Table 1).

allele frequency of KLF rs3782933 were 0.8286 and 0.3333, 
respectively. The SNP of KLF5 showed significant differences 
with several clinical factors, such as BMR, muscle, LDL-C, 
insulin,  and  C-peptide  (Table  2).  Children  with  the  TT 
genotype had significantly higher BMR than those with the 
wild-type (CC genotype) (p = 0.030). The highly correlated 
factors with BMR, such as height and muscle composition, 
were also higher in children with the TT genotype than those 
with the CC genotype (p = 0.032). The diabetic factors, such 
as insulin and C-peptide, were also higher in the children 
with the TT genotype than those with the CC genotype (p 

=0.029 vs. p = 0.004, respectively) (Table 2). On the other 
hand, the alleles of the KLF5 gene showed a divergent trend 
when  compared  with  the  genotype.  For  example,  the 
children with the T allele had significantly lower TC and 
LDL-C than those with the C allele, regardless of BMR (Table 
3). 

Risk factors related to BMR

The parametric Pearson correlation analysis of the data 
revealed  that  BMR  was  significantly  positively  correlated

= 0.002), and C-peptide (r = 0.618, p ＜ 0.001) (data not 
shown). Because the value of BMR and RMR was similar to 
each other, we analyzed the regression equation of BMR with 
the contributors. Linear regression analysis was performed 
to estimate the relative contributions of BMI, muscle, fat 
mass, insulin, and cholesterol to the inter-individual varia-
tions  of  BMR.  In  the  linear  regression  analysis,  BMI  and 
muscle mass were correlated with BMR in every genotype of 
KLF5, whereas insulin and C-peptide were not associated 
with BMR in children with the CT and TT compared to CC 
genotype.  It  was  interesting  that  TC  was  negatively  cor-
related with BMR in only the TT genotype in contrast to the 
CC or CT genotype. (Figs. 1 and 2). Multiple linear regres-
sion analysis was performed to estimate the relative contri-
bution of age, muscle, RI, tricep, glucose, and insulin to BMR 
in children. We identified that age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, 
and fat mass could explain 100% of BMR (adjusted r2 = 
1.000, p ＜ 0.001) in children (Table 4). In the high-BMR 
group,  we  observed  that  higher  muscle,  fat  mass,  and 
C-peptide affected the increase of BMR in children with TT 

genotype (p ＜ 0.001, p ＜ 0.001, and p = 0.018, respecti-
vely),  while  RI  could  explain  the  usual  decrease  in  BMR 
(adjusted r2 = 1.000, p ＜ 0.001). Our prediction equation of 
BMR including age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, and fat mass 
specific for children from 10 to 13 years old is as follows: 
BMR = 369.634＋(1.038 × age) + (22.452 × muscle) ‒ 
(0.087 × RI)+ (0.090 × tricep) + (11.147 × WHR) + 

(0.532 × fat mass).

Discussion

This study was the first report of a KLF5 SNP (rs3782933) 
involved in the susceptibility to BMR in Korean elementary 
school children. Children with the TT genotype had signi-
ficantly higher BMR, muscle, HLD-C, insulin, and C-peptide 
and lower LDL-C than those with the wild-type CC. How-
ever, we found that BMI, muscle, and fat mass could explain 
the  usual  increase  in  BMR  in  every  genotype  in  KLF5, 
whereas insulin and C-peptide were not associated with the 
increase of BMR, except wild-type, in the linear regression 
analysis. Using multiple linear regression analysis, we esti-
mated the predicting equation of BMR in children. In the

related  with  BMR  in  only  the  CC

high-BMR group, TT genotype increased BMR according to 
muscle, fat mass, and C-peptide, and there was an inverse 
correlation between BMR and RI (adjust r2 = 1.000, p ＜ 
0.001). Our results suggested an association between the TT 
mutant homozygotes of KLF5 rs3782933 and BMR in Korean 
children.

BMR is affected by many factors, such as age, gender, body 
composition, and genetic variation. BMR measurement in 
humans was primarily used for the diagnosis of hypo- and 
hyperthyroidism. Recently, BMR was used to estimate hu-
man energy and food requirements as well as the diagnosis of 
thyroid  disease,  diabetes,  and  leukemia  [21].  Up  to  the 
present, alleles of specific genes, such as UCP1, LPL, and 
beta3-AR,  were  considered  to  play  a  major  role  in  the 
development of metabolic complications in the obese popu-
lation  [22].  Moreover,  some  reports  suggested  that  the 
variation in the beta3-adrenergic receptor gene influences 
BMR  in  obese  subjects  and  that  the  synergistic  effect  of 
polymorphisms  in  UCP1  and  beta3-adrenergic  receptor 
genes leads to a lower BMR [15, 23]. Recently, Suchanek et 
al.  [24]  investigated  the  association  between  an  alpha2 
Heremans-Schmid  glycoprotein  (AHSG)  gene  polymor-
phism and obesity. There was a significant correlation bet-
ween  homozygotes  of  AHSG  and  increased  BMR  [24]. 
However, the association of the variation in KLF5 and BMR 

has not been confirmed yet in Korean children. 

Although we identified the novel genetic variation in a 
noncoding region of KLF5, this SNP might affect complex 
diseases,  such  as  obesity  and  diabetes.  Many  disease- 
associated mutations are predicted to be SNPs. Some of the 
SNPs associated with complex diseases might be located in 
the coding and/or noncoding region and lead to alterations 
in the function of the protein [25]. Recently, Oishi et al. [1] 
showed that a novel signaling and transcriptional network 
involving MEF2A and KLF5 －1,282 bp plays a crucial role in 
the  pathogenesis  of  hypertension  and  that  the  KLF5 
promoter allele (－1282A) is associated with a higher preva-
lence of hypertension [1]. KLF5 has also been involved in 
vascular  smooth  muscle  cell  differentiation,  growth,  and 
gene expression [3]. In this population, we divided them 
into  two  groups  by  BMI:  normal  weight  and  overweight. 
Children who are overweight have the potential to be obese 
adults  when  they  grow  up.  We  could  infer  from  the 
relationship between the KLF5 polymorphism and BMR that 
the  variation  of  KLF  is  associated  with  obesity.  Several 
studies  of  diverse  ethnic  groups,  including  Pima  Indians, 
Caucasians,  and  Japanese,  have  demonstrated  that  obese 
individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher BMR com-
pared  to  the  obese  non-diabetic  populations  [26].  In  our 
result, 58% of children in the high-BMR group were over-

weight, and the children with the TT mutant homozygote of 
KLF5 came under the high-BMR group. 

Recently,  the  predicting  equations  for  BMR  have  been 
verified in many populations [12, 27-29]. To cross-validate 
three  predicting  equations  for  BMR  established  by  the 
Schofield database, Henry, and Cole, Ramirez-Zea M used 
mean values for age, weight, height, and BMR. These find-
ings suggested that the equation seemed to be appropriate to 
estimate BMR in men only, not women [28]. Another study 
indicated that a new equation may be more appropriate for 
calculating BMR using age, height, weight, and fat in obese 
children  [27].  In  our  equation,  we  determined  a  BMR 
equation for children between the ages of 10 and 13 years old 
based on age, muscle, RI, tricep, WHR, and fat mass. Our 
predicting equation in children was similar to the previous 
studies. In the normal-weight group, we observed that the 
variables of age, weight, muscle, RI, glucose, and insulin 
were  significant  predictors  of  BMR,  which  accounted  for 
100% of the variation in BMR. However, the final model of 
our equation for BMR in the overweight group included both 
weight and muscle (data not shown). On the other hand, we 
divided them into 2 groups: low- and high-BMR group. In the 
high-BMR  group,  we  established  the  predictive  equation 
using muscle, fat mass, RI, and C-peptide. We observed an 
inverse correlation between BMR and RI in the high-BMR 
group, and the children with the TT genotype belonged to 
the  high-BMR  group.  These  results  indicated  that  the 
children with the TT genotype have a higher BMR compared 
with the children with the CC genotype. 

Although  the  mean  insulin  value  was  higher  in  the 
children  with  the  TT  genotype  than  those  with  the  CC 
genotype,  there  was  no  significant  association  between 
HOMA-IR and TT genotype in our subjects. We postulated 
that the relation of insulin and HOMA-IR may contribute to 
insulin resistance (IR) in our children. IR was  calculated 

Fig.  2.  Correlation  of  basal  metabolic  rate  (BMR)  and  clinical 
variables according to genotype distribution of rs3782933. Insulin 
and C-peptide were correlated with BMR in only the CC genotype
in  contrast  to  the CT or TT  genotype  (A  and  B);  meanwhile, cho-
lesterol was not associated with BMR regardless of genotypes (C).

according  to  HOMA  using  fasting  insulin  and  glucose 
concentrations [30]. Children who were overweight have a 
higher morbidity rate of obesity than children with normal 
weight. Obese adults have more IR than normal, which may 
predispose them to diabetes [30]. Obesity-induced IR is the 
major contributor of metabolic syndrome, and both obesity 
and  IR  are  components  of  metabolic  syndrome  [31,  32]. 
However, we could not observe IR. Also, the insulin value 
and  HOMA-IR  were  not  involved  in  the  equation  of  the 
overweight group. In the high-BMR group only, we observed 
that the higher C-peptide affected the increase of BMR in 
children with the TT genotype. Therefore, obese children 
with the TT genotype may have no potential for becoming 
obese adults with metabolic syndrome. 

There are several limitations in this study. First of all, a 
sample size of this study was too small, because 1) it was 
necessary to use a direct calorimeter for measuring RMR, but 
the device and its expendables, such as mouthpieces, were 
too  expensive  and  not  cost-effective  for  our  study.  If  the 
children were unable to reach steady-state oxygen consump-
tion  in  the  allotted  time  of  approximately  10  min,  the 
children repeated numerous times after resting, and it was 
not easy for younger participants. 2) Parent’s signed per-
mission for these children was mandatory at the first visit, 
but several parents and children rejected informed consent. 
3) It was not sufficient to obtain the blood samples of all 
children for analyzing the genetic polymorphism of KLF5, 
and there was a genotyping error sometimes. Second, we 
could not find out the citations to explain the association 
between  the  KLF5  polymorphism  and  BMR.  There  is 
abundant satisfactory research showing the predictive equa-
tion for BMR in several populations. Although we discovered 
the studies to suggest the genes involved in the regulation of 
energy expenditure metabolism, including UCP1, there was 
not enough research to demonstrate the association of KLF5 
and BMR in this study.

In this study, we found that the TT homozygote of KLF5 
plays a crucial role for increasing BMR and fat mass in Korean 
children. We could make better use of the novel variations 
within KLF5 in a future clinical intervention study of obesity.
