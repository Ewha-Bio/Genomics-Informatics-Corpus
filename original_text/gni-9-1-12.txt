Abstract

Asthma  is  a  chronic  disease  associated  with  airway 
constriction  due  to  inflammation  caused  by  eosinophils, 
mast  cells,  and  T  lymphocytes,  leading  to  serious 
chronic  illness  in  children.  The  eotaxin  gene  family  has 
been  shown  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  patho-
genesis  of  asthma.  We  hypothesized  that  the  distinctive 
variations  among  the  four  seasons  in  Korea  may  affect 
the  expression  of  eotaxin  polymorphisms,  especially  in 
children.  We  examined  the  possible  effects  of  birth  sea-
son  (spring,  March-May;  summer,  June-August;  fall, 
September-November;  and  winter,  December-February) 
on  the  phenotype  of  asthma  in  children.  All  SNP  data 
sets  of  the  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes  were  col-
lected  from  78  asthma  patients  and  101  controls.  Here, 
we  investigated  the  effects  of  birth  season  on  the  ex-
pression  of  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  in  Korean  children. 
Using  the  HAPLOTYPE  procedure  with  the  HTR  method 
in  SAS/Genetics,  we  showed  that  children  born  in  spring 
and  summer  show  significant  haplotypes  in  both  the  eo-
taxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes.  Thus,  the  expression  of 
polymorphisms  in  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  may  vary  by

Introduction

Asthma  is  a  chronic  disease  associated  with  airway 
constriction  due  to  inflammation  caused  by  eosinophils, 
mast  cells,  and  T  lymphocytes  (Laitinen  and  Laitinen, 
1991;  Robinson  et  al.,  1992;  Vignola  et  al.,  1998; 
Wardlaw  et al.,  1988).  The  inflammatory  infiltrate  is 
known  to  be  composed  predominantly  of  eosinophils, 
which  cause  much  of  the  bronchial  mucosal  damage 
that  initiates  clinical  symptoms  (Gleich,  1990).  According 
to  the  annual  report  of  the  American  Lung  Association, 
asthma  is  the  leading  serious  chronic  illness  of  children 
in  the  USA.  An  estimated  6.5  million  children  under  the 
age  of  18  (almost  1.4  million  under  the  age  of  5)  had 
asthma  in  2005  (Centers  for  Disease  Control  and 
Prevention,  2005).  A  recent  nationwide  survey  in  Korea 
reported  that  7.6%  of  school-age  children  (8-11  years 
old)  had  ever  been  diagnosed  for  asthma  by  a  doctor 
(Suh  et al.,  2011).  Asthma  is  also  the  most  common 
cause  of  school  absenteeism  due  to  its  chronic  nature. 
In  2003,  children  in  the  US  aged  between  5  and  17 
years  who  reported  at  least  one  asthma  attack  missed 
12.8  million  school  days  due  to  the  disease  (Centers  for 
Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  2007).  A  Korean  study 
(Lee  et al.,  2002)  reported  that  increased  levels  of  air 
pollution,  such  as  sulfur  dioxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and 
carbon  monoxide,  had  adverse  effects  on  sensitive  sub-
jects,  including  asthmatic  children. 
    The  cysteine-cysteine  (CC)  chemokine  eotaxin  has 
been  shown  to  play  an  important  role  in  the  patho-
genesis  of  asthma.  Eotaxin  recruits  eosinophils  by  acti-
vating  the  CCR3  receptor  present  on  eosinophils,  baso-
philic  leukocytes,  and  T  lymphocytes  (Daugherty  et al., 
1996;  Sallusto  et al.,  1997;  Uguccioni  et al.,  1997).  In 
the  human  genome,  the  gene  encoding  eotaxin  is  lo-
cated  on  the  short  arm  of  chromosome  17  (17q21.1- 
q21.2),  where  most  of  the  chemokine  genes  are  clus-
tered,  and  comprises  three  exons  and  two  introns. 
These  CC  chemokines  are  known  to  act  as  chemo-
attractants  and  activate  inflammatory  leukocytes,  espe-
cially  lymphocytes,  monocytes,  eosinophils,  and  baso-
phils,  as  well  as  some  stromal  cells  (Alam,  1997; 
Corrigan,  1999).  The  eotaxin  gene  family  can  be  divided 

Genetic  Association  between  Eotaxin  Genes  and  Asthma  and  Its  Relationship  to  Birth  Season  in  Korean  Children    13

three  subfamilies:  eotaxin 

into 
(CCL11),  eotaxin-2 
(CCL24),  and  eotaxin-3  (CCL26)  (Forssmann et al.,  1997; 
Jose et al.,  1994;  Kitaura et al.,  1999;  Patel et al.,  1997; 
Shinkai  et al.,  1999).  Among  these  subfamilies,  eotaxin 
and  eotaxin-2  have  similar  eosinophil  chemotactic  prop-
erties,  whereas  eotaxin-3  shows  about  10-fold  less  po-
tency  (Kitaura  et al.,  1999).
    The  season  of  birth  has  been  reported  to  affect  the 
development  of  atopy  and  asthma.  Birth  during  late  win-
ter  and  spring  is  associated  with  childhood  asthma 
(Lendor  et al.,  2006).  The  prevalence  of  IgE  antibodies 
to  allergens  is  higher  among  children  born  in  the  au-
tumn  and  winter  seasons  (Nilsson  et al.,  1997).
    In  the  present  study,  we  examined  the  possible  ef-
fects  of  birth  season  on  the  phenotype  of  asthma  in 
children.  As  Korea  has  four  distinct  seasons,  we  hy-
pothesized  that  these  seasonal  factors  may  affect  the 
expression  of  asthma  phenotypes  differentially  by  poly-
morphisms  of  the  eotaxin  genes  in  Korean  children.  All 
SNP  data  sets  of  the  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes 
from  both  asthmatic  and  non-asthmatic  children  were 
determined,  and  we  then  constructed  a  local  database 
according 
in-
formation,  including  sex,  age,  birth  season,  and  genomic 
region  (exon  or  intron),  to  facilitate  the  extraction  of  par-
ticular  data  sets  for  statistical  analyses.

Methods

Subjects  and  genotyping

Data,  including  clinical  information,  were  obtained  from 
78  asthma  patients  (46  males,  32  females)  and  101  con-
trols  (59  males,  42  females)  without  asthma.  Asthma  pa-
tients  (age  range  2-15  years)  who  visited  the  hospital 
with  asthma  symptoms  were  first  recruited  as  a  patient 
group,  and  then,  appropriate  subjects  were  selected  ac-
cording  to  the  age  ratio  of  the  case  and  control  group 
and  the  results  of  the  clinical  diagnosis.  The  controls 
were  recruited  from  subjects  who  also  visited  the  hospi-
tal  without  any  symptoms  of  respiratory  or  allergic  dis-
eases  in  a  similar  age  range  as  the  patient  group.  The 
mean  ages  of  asthma  patients  and  controls  were  9.14 
years  and  9.20  years,  respectively  (Fig.  1).  Blood  sam-
pling  was  conducted  at  the  Department  of  Pediatrics, 
Inha  University  Hospital,  Inchon,  Korea.  Genotyping  was 
performed  by  two-dimensional  gene  scanning  (TDGS),  a 
high-resolution  system  for  the  detection  of  mutations 
based  on  two-dimensional  DNA  electrophoresis  com-
bined  with  extensive  multiplex  polymerase  chain  re-
action  (PCR)  (Vijg,  1999).  Informed  consent  was  ob-
tained  from  the  parents,  and  this  study  was  approved 
by  the  institutional  review  board  of  Inha  University 

Hospital,  Inchon,  Korea.

Data  analysis

For  efficient  haplotype  analysis,  we  parsed  the  source 
data  sets  into  various  categories;  i.e.,  sex,  age,  eotaxin 
subfamily,  genomic  region  (exon  or  intron),  and  birth 
season.  With  regard  to  birth  season,  patients  were 
grouped  into  those  born  in  spring  (March-May),  summer 
(June-August), 
(September-November),  or  winter 
(December-February),  and  the  analysis  was  performed 
for  each  birth  season  group.  All  data  sets  were  first 
stored  in  our  local  database  according  to  each  cat-
egory,  and  then,  particular  data  sets  were  extracted 
from  the  database  for  further  statistical  analysis  using 
JAVA  codes.

Pairwise  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  analyses  for  each 
marker  shown  in  Figure  2  were  conducted  using  the 
SAS/Genetics  module  of  SAS  version  9.1  (Cary,  2005). 
Seven  SNPs  of  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  were  first  ana-
lyzed  using  PROC  ALLELE  and  PROC  CASECONTROL, 
and 
from  PROC 
CASECONTROL  was  used  as  input  data  for  the  PROC 
PSMOOTH  process.  The  PSMOOTH  procedure  was 
used  to  reduce  the  number  of  false  positives  or  improve 
statistical  power,  and  Simes’  method  (Simes,  1986)  was 
used  as  a  smoothing  method  in  this  study.  The 
%TPLOT  macro  in  SAS/Genetics  was  used  to  create  a 
triangular  plot  for  graphical  display  of  genetic  marker 
test  results.  This  plot  also  shows  the  results  from  LD 
tests  obtained  by  the  ALLELE  procedure,  based  on  the 
chi-square  distribution  of  LD  statistics.
    Haplotype  frequencies  were  estimated  using  the  re-

gression  model  of  PROC  HAPLOTYPE  in  the  SAS 
package.  The  HAPLOTYPE  procedure  uses  the  expect-
ation-maximization  (EM)  algorithm  to  generate  maximum 
likelihood  estimates  of  haplotype  frequencies,  given  a 
multilocus  sample  of  genetic  marker  genotypes  under 
the  assumption  of  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE). 
The  regression  model  used  in  this  study,  which  can  be 
more  powerful  than  the  omnibus  χ2  test  performed  in 
PROC  HAPLOTPYE,  was  also  used  to  test  haplotypes 
for  their  association  with  a  phenotype  (Schaid  et al., 
2002).  The  output  from  PROC  HAPLOTYPE  was  used  to 
test  for  association  with  haplotypes  by  applying  the 
haplotype  trend  regression  (HTR)  method  (Zaykin et al., 
2002).  This  method  has  a  number  of  advantages.  First, 
the  haplotype-specific  scores  can  be  computed  easily, 
allowing  evaluation  of  individual  haplotypes  when  the 
global  score  statistic  indicates  statistical  significance; 
and  second,  the  global  quadratic  statistic,  as  well  as  its 
simulation  p-value,  can  be  computed  easily  to  evaluate 
whether  only  a  few  haplotypes  are  strongly  associated 
with  a  trait  (Schaid et al.,  2002).  The  SNPassoc  library 
in  R-package  (http://davinci.crg.es/estivill_lab/snpassoc) 
was  used  to  calculate  odds  ratios  (OR)  (95%  confidence 

interval)  for  SNP  sites  (González  et al.,  2007). 

Results

The  distribution  of  sex  and  age  was  similar  between 
asthma  patients  (59%  males,  9.1  years  old  on  average) 
and  controls  (58%  males,  9.2  years  old  on  average). 
The  range  and  shape  of  the  age  distribution  were  also 
similar  between  the  two  groups  (Fig.  1).

Genetic  markers  of  susceptibility  and  linkage 
disequilibrium

In  the  present  study,  we  analyzed  our  haplotype  data 
sets  using  both  a  traditional  method  that  performs  the 
omnibus  χ2  test  and  the  haplotype  trend  regression 
(HTR)  method,  which  is  based  on  score  equations  for 
generalized  linear  models  (Zaykin  et al.,  2002).  To  de-
termine  the  association  with  susceptibility  of  children  to 
asthma,  we  compared  the  frequencies  of  genotypes  for 
a  total  of  seven  SNPs  in  both  exon  and  intron  regions 
of  the  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes:  five  SNPs  in  the 
eotaxin-2  gene  and  two  SNPs  in  the  eotaxin-3  gene 
(Table  1).  No  significant  associations  were  found  be-
tween  the  SNPs  of  eotaxin  genes  and  asthma  when 
they  were  analyzed  by  any  model  of  inheritance. 
Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  analysis  showed  no  LD  over 
the  entire  gene,  but  some  SNPs,  such  as  SNP511-

SNP2123  (p＜0.01),  SNP511-SNP2126  (p＜0.01),  and 
SNP 257-SNP475 (p＜0.05), showed significant LD (Fig. 2). 

Comparison  of  the  seasonal  haplotype  frequen-
cies  among  seven  SNPs  across  eotaxin-2  and 
eotaxin-3

To  investigate  the  seasonal  differences  in  the  effects  of 
the  polymorphisms  of  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3,  we  ana-
lyzed  the  haplotype  frequencies  in  the  overall  region,  in-
cluding  both  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  gene  regions 
(Table  2).  We  showed  the  results  for  two  major  hap-
lotypes  for  each  season,  if  no  further  analysis  for  less 
frequent  haplotypes  was  informative.  We  found  three 

significant  haplotypes  in  three  birth  groups  (spring, 
summer,  and  winter).  In  the  spring  birth  group,  which  in-
cluded  21  patients  and  20  controls  (average  age=7.4 
years  old),  the  haplotype  C-G-C-C-A-C-A  (p＜0.008) 
was  detected  by  HTR  analysis  with  a  frequency  of  0.14. 
In  the  summer  and  winter  birth  groups  (average  ages  = 
7.1  and  7.3  years  old,  respectively),  the  haplotypes 
C-A-T-T-C-C-A (P＜0.025) and C-G-C-C-A-T-A (p＜0.036) 
were  also  found.

Comparison  of  the  seasonal  haplotype  frequen-
cies  among  SNPs  of  respective  eotaxin-2  and 
eotaxin-3  gene  regions

To  assess  the  seasonal  differences  in  the  effects  of  the 
polymorphisms  of  each  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  region, 
we  also  analyzed  the  haplotype  frequencies  in  each  eo-
taxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  gene  region  (Tables  3  and  4).  In 
each  eotaxin  gene,  the  spring  and  summer  birth  groups 
showed  significant  haplotypes  in  asthma  patients.  For 
the  eotaxin-2  gene,  which  had  five  SNPs  at  mRNA  posi-
tions  475,  504,  511,  2123,  and  2126,  two  haplotypes 
were  detected  by  the  HTR  method  in  the  spring  and 
summer  seasonal  groups:  T-C-C-A-A  (p＜0.007)  and 
C-C-C-A-A  (p＜0.026),  respectively  (Table  3).  Two  sig-
nificant  haplotypes  were  also  detected  in  the  eotaxin-3 
gene,  which  had  two  SNPs  at  mRNA  positions  257  and 
2677,  including  T-T  (p＜0.047)  and  C-T  (p＜0.02),  in  the 
spring  and  summer  groups.

nophils  and  the  maintenance  of  IgE  levels  in  asthma  pa-
tients  (Chae et al.,  2004;  Corrigan,  1999;  Mattoli et al., 
1997).  Hidetoshi et al.  (1999)  reported  that  the  OR  of  an 
asthma  diagnosis  increased  with  eotaxin  quartile,  with 
the  highest  quartile  having  an  OR  of  5.4  compared  with 
the  lowest  eotaxin  quartile,  and  plasma  eotaxin  levels 
were  associated  with  asthma,  independent  of  age,  race, 
sex,  or  smoking  status.  Previously,  Nilsson et al.  (1997) 
observed  that  the  season  of  birth  was  a  significant  pre-
dictor  of  atopic  manifestations  as  well  as  circulating  IgE 
antibodies  to  mixed  allergens  among  children  aged  15 
or  younger.  Potential  explanations  for  the  differences  by 
birth  season  include  seasonal  differences  in  pregnant 
mothers’  exposure  to  seasonal  allergens,  the  baby’s  ex-
posure  during  susceptible  periods  after  birth,  or  later 
environmental  influences  during  the  baby’s  development 
of  immunity.

    In  the  present  study,  we  could  not  find  an  association 
of  eotaxin  genotypes  with  the  asthma  phenotype.  This 
might  have  been  due  to  the  lack  of  statistical  power 
arising  from  the  limitation  in  sample  size.  However,  we 
observed  a  significant  association  between  certain  hap-
lotypes  and  the  asthma  phenotype,  when  the  analysis 
was  stratified  by  birth  season.  Our  study  suggests  that 
birth  season  might  be  involved  to  modify  the  expression 
of  the  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes  in  Korean  children. 
Korea  has  large  environmental  variations  among  the  four 
seasons  in  temperature,  humidity,  and  rainfall,  and  we 
hypothesized  that  these  seasonal  differences  might  af-
fect  the  expression  of  eotaxin  polymorphisms,  especially 
in  children.  Using  the  HAPLOTYPE  procedure  with  the 
HTR  method  in  SAS/Genetics,  we  found  that  children 
born  in  spring  and  summer  showed  significant  hap-
lotypes  in  both  the  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  genes 

Genetic  Association  between  Eotaxin  Genes  and  Asthma  and  Its  Relationship  to  Birth  Season  in  Korean  Children    17

(Tables  2,  3,  and  4).  From  the  analyses  described 
above,  we  conclude  that  the  expression  of  poly-
morphisms  in  eotaxin-2  and  eotaxin-3  are  likely  to  be 
differentially  affected  by  the  birth  season  of  asthma  pa-
tients  in  Korea.
