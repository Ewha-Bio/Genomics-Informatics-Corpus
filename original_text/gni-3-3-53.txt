Abstract 
MicroRNAs  play  an  important  role  in  regulating  gene 
expression, but their target identification is a difficult task 
due to their short length and imperfect complementarity. 
Burge  and  coworkers  developed  a  program  called 
TargetScan that allowed imperfect complementarity and 
established  a  procedure  favoring  targets  with  multiple 
binding  sites  conserved  in  multiple  organisms.  We 
improved their algorithm in two major aspects - (i)  using 
well-defined  UTR  (untranslated  region)  database,  (ii) 
examining the extent of conservation  inside the 3'  UTR 
specifically. Average length in our UTR database, based 
on  the  ECgene  annotation,  is  more  than  twice  longer 
than  the  Ensembl.  Then,  TargetScan  was  used  to 
identify putative binding sites. The extent of conservation 
varies significantly inside the 3' UTR. We used the "tight" 
tracks  in  the  UCSC  genome  browser  to  select  the 
in  multiple  species.  By 
conserved  binding  sites 
combining  the  longer  3'  UTR  data,  TargetScan,  and 
tightly conserved blocks of genomic DNA, we identified 
107  putative  target  genes  with  multiple  binding  sites 
conserved  in  multiple  species,  of  which  85  putative 
targets are novel.

Introduction 
MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (typically 21-23

nucleotides)  that  play  an  important  role  in  regulating 
post-transcriptional  translation.  They  bind  to  the target 
mRNA  by  RNA  base  pairing,  which  causes  target 
cleavage  or  translational  repression  according  to  the 
extent of complementarity. Lin-4 discovered in C. elegans, 
was the first microRNA (Lee et at., 1993; Wightman et at., 
1993).  It  has multiple complementary sites in  3'  UTR of 
lin-14. Binding of lin-4 to lin-14leads to transition between 
larval  stages,  which  suggested  microRNA's  role  in 
developmental control. To date, several hundred microRNAs 
have  been  identified  from  various  organisms  and  their 
sequences  are  available  at  the  Rfam  miRNA  registry 
website (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam) (Ambros 
eta/., 2003a; Griffiths-Janes, 2004). 

MicroRNAs have various  regulatory roles other than 
controlling developmental timing.  For example,  bantam 
promotes cell  proliferation  (Abrahante  et at.,  2003) and 
Drosophila mi R-14 coordinates multiple cellular responses 
to  stress  (Xu  et at.,  2003).  Recent  study  reports  that 
human  miR-15  and  miR-16  are  located  in  a  region 
frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which 
means that microRNAs may be tumor suppressors (Cal in 
eta/., 2002). Functions of microRNAs are closely related 
to their target gene. 

There are not many microRNAs with known targets in 
animal. Targets of lin-4, let-7, bantam, and hsa-miR-196 
are  experimentally  verified  (Abrahante  et  at.,  2003; 
Brennecke  et at.,  2003;  Lin  et at.,  2003;  Olsen  et at., 
1999;  Seggerson  et  at.,  2002;  Yekta  et  at.,  2004). 
Recently  we  have  seen  many  attempts  to  identify 
microRNA targets computationally in plants and animals. 
While simple homology search  performs  well  for target 
search in plants since they usually require almost perfect 
complementarity  (Ambros  et  a/.,  2003b;  Bartel  et  at., 
2003),  target  prediction  in  animal  (Enright  et at.,  2003; 
Kiriakidou  et at.,  2004;  Lewis  et at.,  2003;  Rajewsky  et 
at.,  2004;  Rhoades  et at.,  2002;  Stark  et at.,  2003)  is 
much more difficult because of the absence of extensive 
complementarity  between  mammalian  microRNAs  and 
their targets (Doench et at., 2003; Lee et at.,  1993; Moss 
et at.,  1997;  Olsen  et at.,  1999;  Reinhart  et at.,  2000; 
Wightman et at.,  1993; Zeng et at., 2002). It is found that 
the  5'  core  element  of  microRNA  should  be  nearly 
perfectly  complementary  to  the  target  even  though 
partial  complementarity  between  microRNA  and  its 
target is allowed in animal. It implies that the residue 2-8

in  the  microRNA  is  an  important  factor  in  recognizing 
target  sites,  and  this  microRNA  seed  is  conserved  in 
invertebrates and  in  the  homologous  metazoan  region 
(Lewis eta/., 2003; Lim et at., 2003). 

indels to make longer conserved blocks whose average 
block size is 600 bp for human-mouse comparison. The 
data was downloaded from the UCSC ftp site (ftp://genorne. 
ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg16). 

from 

regions 

Recently,  Lewis  et  a/.  developed  a  robust  target 
prediction program, TargetScan, which utilizes the seed 
match  and  multiple  binding  sites  conserved  among 
different species (Lewis  et at.,  2003).  They extracted 3' 
UTR 
the  Ensembl  gene  models 
(http://www.ensembl.org)  and  extended  the  annotated 
UTRs  by  2kb  to  compensate  for  insufficient  UTR 
annotation in the rat genome. TargetScan predicted 451 
putative mammalian microRNA targets,  and they found 
experimental support for  11  targets out of  15 predicted 
targets using the luciferase reporter assay. 

However,  when  we examined the predicted  binding 
sites in those 15 target genes, we found that approximately 
25 % of those binding sites were not conserved in other 
species.  Furthermore, 3' UTR region of many genes are 
longer than 2 kbp. We present a protocol that improves the 
TargetScan  algorithm  by  constructing  a  better  UTR 
database and  by examining the extent of conservation 
inside the 3' UTR specifically. 

Materials and Methods 
Data preparation 
ll/laoRNA c:Jatamse: The Rfam database (http:/ /vwwv.sanger. 
ac.uk/Software/Rfaml) was used as a source of microRNA 
gene  database  (Ambros  et at.,  2003a;  Griffiths-Janes, 
2004). The Rfam release 3.0 was downloaded, and 152 
mature microRNAs from human were selected for target 
identification.  Most microRNAs are  identical  in  human, 
mouse, and rat. 

3'Limditab9se:ECgeneversion 1.1  (hg16, mm4, rn3for 
human,  mouse,  rat,  respectively at UCSC) was used to 
extract the  3'  UTR  regions  of  human,  mouse,  and  rat 
genomes.  ECgene  (Kim  et at.,  2004;  Kim  et at.,  2005) 
builds gene models taking alternative splicing into consid(cid:173)
eration, and the redundant 3' UTRs from splice variants 
were  removed  from  the  dataset  to  build  the  non-re(cid:173)
dundant 3' UTR database. The non-redundant human 3' 
UTR data in the UTRdb (Pesole eta/., 2002) Release 17 
is available at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/BIG/UTRHome. 
Ccnparative genonics data: Among several comparative 
genomics tracks available in the UCSC genome site, we 
chose the ''tight" track of the conserved blocks since they 
were filtered with most stringent conditions. The average 
block size is approximately 200 bp both for human-mouse 
and human-rat genomes. The "net" track ignores small 

MicroRNA target scan 
TargetScan program available at http://genes.mit.edu/ 
targetscan was used to find the microRNAs targets. We 
applied the TargetScan program for all microRNAs using 
our  own  UTR  datasets  from  the  ECgene  for  human, 
mouse, and rat genomes. We used the default parameters 
for TargetScan.  Initially,  TargetScan  searches for com(cid:173)
plementary  matches  (so  called  the  "seed  match")  for 
bases 2-8 of the microRNA (numbered from the 5' end). 
The  complementary  seeds  are  extended 
in  both 
directions,  and the remaining 3'  portion of microRNA is 
optimally aligned within 35 bases flanking the target UTR 
seed.  When 
the  distance  between  adjacent  seed 
matches  is  less  than  20  bases,  the  downstream  seed 
match is discarded as in the original TargetScan paper. 

Conservation of target sites in multiple genomes 
To use the comparative genomics information available 
at the UCSC genome center, the target positions within 
the  UTR  sequence  were  converted  into  the  genomic 
coordinates.  The  gene  structure  should  be taken  into 
consideration since the  UTR region  may contain  intron 
sequences.  Determining conserved target sites is not a 
trivial task since there are so many putative target sites 
from the TargetScan and so many conserved blocks in 
the  "tight"  tracks.  In  an  effort to  reduce  the  number of 
comparisons,  the binning scheme was implemented as 
described 
the  UCSC  genome  browser  paper 
(Karolchik et at.,  2003;  Kent et at.,  2002). 

in 

Target genes with multiple binding sites 
Target  genes  with  multiple  binding  sites  are  usually 
preferred. Lewis eta/. implemented this idea as the Z score 
that sums contribution of multiple binding sites using the 
binding energies obtained from Vienna RNA package. In 
this  study,  filtering target sites  using tight conservation 
criterion  left manageable number of target sites.  So we 
constructed a  database containing all  conserved target 
sites. A simple database query can extract target genes 
with multiple binding sites if necessary.

difference species is an important clue for their functional 
importance.  Homology by amino acid comparison is not 
enough to identify microRNA target sites since we need 
the conservation  in  the 3'  UTR,  not in  the CDS  (coding 
sequence)  region.  The whole 3'  UTR is  not necessarily 
conserved in other species. We examined the conservation 
for 40 predicted binding sites in 14 target genes used in the 
luciferase  reporter  assay  by  Lewis  et  at.  Using  the 
PhyloHMM  score  (Siepel  et at.,  2004a;  Siepel  et at., 
2004b) available at the UCSC genome browser, we found 
that only 30 binding sites had average score over 0.5. This 
demonstrates that the extent of conservation should be 
specifically examined for each binding sites in the UTR, 
and  the  comparative  genomics  approach  is  a  viable 
method to confirm whether each binding site is conserved 
in multiple species. 

We also performed a simulation test on the selection ratio 
achieved by adopting this cross-species conservation. We 
selected  a  random  test  set of 56  microRNAs  from  152 
microRNAs in the Rfam.  A shuffled set was prepared by 
randomly permuting the microRNA sequences with their 
nucleotide  composition  unchanged.  Then  we  ran  the 
TargetScan  to  identify the binding  sites  using the set of 
longest  UTR for  each  ECgene cluster  (refer to  the  next 
section). Transcripts with multiple binding sites were 36491 
and 20615 for the test set and the shuffled set, respectively. 
Therefore, selection ratio by multiple binding sites is 1.77:1. 
Examining conservation of the predicted site with PhyloHMM 
score over 0.9 resulted in 396 and 158 target transcripts for 
the two sets. This implies that the selection ratio by multiple 
binding sites and cross-species conservation is 2.51:1. 

Construction of UTR databases 

Proper  3'  UTR  database  is  necessary  for  microRNA 
target  identification.  Lewis  et  at.  used  the  Ensembl 
database.  Ensembl  Human  v20.34c.1  includes  22287 
human  genes,  16203  of  those  with  annotated  3'  UTR 
region. 6084 genes do not have 3'  UTR region and UTR 
region  is  not  long  enough  even  for  those  annotated 
genes. To alleviate this problem,  Lewis  et at.  extended 
the annotated 3'  UTR region by 2 kbp arbitrarily in their 
TargetScan  calculation.  Even  though  this  approach 
recovers  UTR  regions  for  many  genes,  it  certainly 
introduces false target sites in the intergenic region. 

for  gene  variants 

We  used  the  ECgene  annotation  that  has  several 
merits  over  other  gene  predictions.  First,  it  includes 
extensive  gene  modeling 
from 
alternative  splicing.  So  UTR  variation  from  alternative 
splicing or poly A can be naturally taken into consideration. 
Second, the 3' UTR region in the ECgene is highly reliable 
since it is based on EST clustering that includes ample 3' 
EST sequences. Furthermore, the 3' UTRs are substantially 
longer  since  they  are  extended  by  overlapping  EST 
sequences aligned in the same orientation. 

In  Fig.  1, we compare the length distribution of the 3' 
UTR  databases  from  the  Ensembl  and  ECgene.  We 
extracted 24956 transcripts with 3' UTRs in the Ensembl 
human using the EnsMart system (Kasprzyk et at., 2004) 
and  identified corresponding 16201  ECgene transcripts 
by cross-referencing with RefSeq I D.  More than 40% of 
the  Ensembl transcripts have 3'  UTRs shorter than 300 
bp while only about 24% of the ECgene transcripts have 
less than 300 bp 3'  UTRs. The average 3'  UTR lengths 
are 549 and 1137 bp for the Ensembl and the ECgene, 
respectively.  ECgene's  UTR  length  is  almost  twice 
longer than corresponding Ensembl genes on average. It 
is also noteworthy that 27 45 ECgene transcripts have 3' 
UTR region longer than 2 kbp and that 3'  UTR region of

1116 transcripts  is  longer than  3  kbp.  Extending  UTR 
region by 2 kbp in the original TargetScan work may not 
be effective for those genes. Similar comparison with the 
manually  curated  UTRdb  (Pesole  et at.,  2002}  shows 
that ECgene's UTR length is longer than UTRdb by 16%. 
Therefore, we believe that our 3' UTR dataset should be 
ideal to find any charactristic features within the 3'  UTR 
such as microRNA target sites. 

Algorithmic overview 
Brief overview of our strategy is summarized in Fig. 2. All 
human microRNAs were downloaded from the Rfam site 
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/).  Database  of 
3' UTR sequences were constructed from all ECgene (Kim 
et at.,  2004;  Kim et at.,  2005) transcripts with annotated 
coding sequences. ECgene contained 269,702 distinctive 
3' UTR regions for the human transcriptome. Target genes 
of  each  miRNA  were  predicted  using  the  TargetScan 
program for our own 3' UTR datasets for human, mouse 
and rat.  We found  1,123,986 putative target sites in the 
human  3'  UTR  data.  UTR  regions  in  mouse  and  rat 
genomes contained  934,796  and  207,200 target  sites, 
respectively. 

Comparative genomics data available at the UCSC ge-

nome center were used to find conserved target sites in 
three organisms. We used the "tighf' track (tight subset of 
the best alignments obtained by BLASTZ) (Schwartz et at., 
2003),  which  satisfied  the  most  stringent  requirements. 
Applying  the  conservation  criterion  greatly  reduced  the 
number of target sites. We found -28,000 target sites con(cid:173)
served between the human and mouse genomes, which 
was only 0.7% of miRNA:human target sites (1, 123,986) found 
by  TargetScan.  Approximately  13,000  conserved  target 
sites were found for the human and rat genomes. Combining 
two pair-wise comparisons gave -8,000 target sites con(cid:173)
served in the human, mouse, and rat genomes. Selecting 
target genes with multiple (:::C:2) conserved binding sites for 
a specific microRNA, we found 107 target genes. 

To  compare  our  result  with  the  original  TargetScan 
work by Lewis et at., we downloaded all target genes and 
the  binding  sites  from  the  TargetScan  website.  They 
published 442 target genes with multiple (:::C:2) conserved 
binding sites, which were considerably larger than our 107 
target genes.  We shall  refer to their result as "Ensembl 
targets" since they used the Ensembl gene annotation. 

Candidate target genes 
Our  result  is  substantially  different  from  the  Ensembl

targets.  Only  22  out  of  1 07  genes  are  found  by  both 
methods.  Table  1  is  the  list  of  those  common  target 
genes from the two studies. It shows that 15 of 22 genes 
are targets of the same or similar microRNAs.  Detailed 
examination,  however,  reveals  that  many  genes  are 
targets  of  different microRNAs even  for those common 

target  genes.  The  difference  is  clearer  in  Table  2 that 
shows the target genes found by the two methods for 1 0 
important  microRNAs.  Complete  list  is  provided  as  a 
supplementary material. We do not find  many common 
target  genes  (shown  in  bold  character),  and  describe 
factors for the difference below.

The  most  influential  factor  is  the  way to  determine 
whether  the  target  site  is  conserved  in  other  species. 
Lewis eta/. used the homologous gene information in the 
Ensembl annotation system (Birney eta/., 2004). Ensembl 
homologues are obtained by comparing the amino acid 
sequence of proteins (Clamp eta/., 2003).  Even though 
this is perfectly valid for comparing coding regions, it does 
not guarantee that the UTR regions are conserved. The 
"Conservation" track (Siepel eta/., 2004a) in Fig. 3 shows 
the  conservation  level  obtained  by  comparing  five 
organisms (human, chimp, mouse, rat, and chicken). It can 
be immediately recognized that the extent of sequence 
conservation varies dramatically inside the 3' UTR region. 
Our method uses the "tight" track that includes conserved 
blocks of high quality only as can be seen in Fig. 3. This 
is the major reason why the number of target genes is 
substantially  smaller  in  the  ECgene  targets.  All  of  our 
target  sites  are  highly  likely  to  be  conserved  in  other 
species, which reduces risk of being false positives. 

Another  big  difference  is  the  gene  model  and  the 

resultant UTR. ECgene's UTR is significantly longer than 
other gene models since its algorithm tries to extend the 
UTR regions if it finds any overlapping ESTs with the same 
direction. Detailed comparison is given in the next section. 
Furthermore, alternative splicing is extensively modeled 
in the ECgene (Kim eta/., 2004; Kim eta/., 2005), which 
greatly  expands  the  number  of  transcripts.  Current 
Ensembl database (Ensembl Human v20.34c.1) includes 
35685 transcripts from 23758 genes. Approximately 70% 
(16534) of Ensembl have single transcript and remaining 
7224 genes give 19151 transcripts, implying 2.65 isoforms 
per gene  if  the  gene  is  alternatively  spliced.  However, 
current knowledge implies that -70% of human genes are 
alternatively  spliced  and  that  -3.5  isoforms  exist  for 
alternatively spliced genes. Therefore transcripts in the 
Ensembl do not reflect diversity from alternative splicing 
adequately.  Our UTR database based  on  ECgene has 
269702 distinct UTR regions. Even though it may include 
many false positives, its coverage should be most complete. 
The difference is explored in the following cases in detail. 

Fig. 3. Target binding sites and sequence conservation in CYP26B1. The first track in black color shows all target binding sites found 
by TargetScan. MicroRNAs with multiple binding sites are shown in colored boxes. The gene is on the antisense strand (3' end on 
the left side) as indicated by arrows in the intron. The genomic region is mostly the last exon, where the CDS is tall and the 3' UTR 
region is short. Lower half shows several tracks for comparative genomics. Conservation track in black clearly shows that the binding 
sites for hsa-miR-141 are not conserved in multiple species. The track labeled as "Mouse Tight" is the most stringent collection of the 
conserved regions between human and mouse.

Case study 1: CYP2681 
We  observed  in  Tables  1 and  2 that  target  genes  are 
much  different  between  two  methods.  For  example, 
CYP2681  (Nelson,  1999), a member of the cytochrome 
P450 superfamily of  enzymes,  is target of  miR-93 and 
miR-302  in  our study,  whereas  miR-141  is  the  binding 
microRNA in the original TargetScan study. 

Fig. 3 summarizes relevant information for CYP26B1 
in  the  genome  browser.  It  shows the  gene  structures, 
binding sites, and comparative genomics data. All target 
sites found by the TargetScan program are listed without 
filtering by conservation or multiple binding sites. The 3' 
UTR  regions  are  more  or  less  the  same  between  the 
ECgene,  Ensembl gene,  and RefSeq gene tracks.  Both 

60  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 3(3) 53-62, September 2005 

miR-93  and  miR-302  have  two  identical  binding  sites 
(shown in the red boxes). Several tracks are available for 
comparative genomics. The "conservation" track (Human/ 
Chimp/Mouse/Rat/Chicken Multiz Alignments & PhyloHMM 
Cons) is especially useful  (Siepel  eta/., 2004b).  It can  be 
immediately  seen  that  we  have  two  large  conserved 
blocks - one for the last exon and the other near the end 
of 3'  UTR region. The "mouse tight" track is collection of 
most  highly  conserved  blocks.  Other  tracks  such  as 
"chain"  and  "nef'  are  conservation  with  less  stringent 
conditions. We observe that two binding sites of miR-93 and 
miR-302 appear within the highly conserved genomic locus. 
The Ensembl target, hsa-miR-141, has three binding 
sites (shown in boxes) for this gene, which is advantageous 
over  miR-93  and  miR-302  with  two  binding  sites. 
However, the conservation level for these target sites is 
much lower in the "conservation" track,  and they do not 
qualify for conserved blocks in the mouse tight track. Even 
though  targets with  multiple binding sites are generally 
preferred, the mechanism underlying the cooperativeness 
between  the  binding  sites  is  not  established  well. 
Conservation in other species should be a clear evidence 
for its functional importance. Therefore, CYP2681 would 
not be  a good target for  hsa-miR-141  since  its  binding 
sites are not conserved  in  high standard.  This example 
shows  that  finding  target  genes  for  microRNAs  needs 
subtle  adjustment  of  various  aspects  such  as  multiple 
binding sites and conservation among different species. 

Case study 2: PTEN 
PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) is an important 
gene involved in regulation of the AKT1  signaling pathway. 
Mutations of PTEN are found in a large number of cancers 
and it is a potential tumor suppressor gene (Di Cristofano 
eta/., 2000). Lewis eta/. identified PTEN as a target of two 
microRNAs- hsa-miR-19a and hsa-miR-19b. Our method 
did not find any microRNA targeting this gene. The main 
reason was that the PTEN annotation in rat did not have 
UTR at all. Lewis eta/. cleverly extended the 3' UTR region 
by 2 kbp to alleviate this problem. 

Fig. 4 shows the 3' UTR of human PTEN with predicted 
target sites. The 3' UTR is unusually long- 6.5 kbp and 1.2 
kbp  in  the  ECgene  and  Ensembl,  respectively.  Even 
though the human PTEN has three binding sites as Lewis 
eta/. found, only the first two binding sites are found in the 
mouse PTEN and the rat PTEN has only one binding site. 
So hsa-miR-19a and hsa-miR-19b do not have multiple 
conserved binding sites in  PTEN. 

Instead, we identified many other conserved binding 
sites as shown in Fig. 4. The major hurdle in identifying 
conserved targets is the poor annotation in the rat genome. 
The UTR in the mouse PTEN is 3.3 kbp long, but there are 

many neighboring EST transcripts and it is expected to be 
as long as the UTR of human PTEN. So, we extended the 
UTRs of PTEN in mouse and rat to be 6.5 kbp comparable 
to the human PTEN. The number of binding sites found by 
TargetScan is shown in Table 3.  We found additional 
binding sites for five microRNAs (hsa-miR-30a, hsa-miR-
23a,  hsa-miR-23b,  hsa-miR-29b,  hsa-miR-29c).  Fur(cid:173)
thermore, four additional microRNAs (hsa-miR-200a, hsa(cid:173)
miR-181a, hsa-miR-181b, hsa-miR-181c) were identified 
to have multiple conserved binding sites for PTEN. 

Hsa-miR-23a  and  hsa-miR-23b  have  four  binding 
sites in human as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 3. The fourth 
binding site does not belong to the conserved block as can 
be  seen  in  the conservation  track.  Three  other binding 
sites appear inside the conserved  region.  However, the 
third binding  site is located outside the 2 kbp extended 
region of Ensembl UTR (indicated as long vertical lines in 
brown color in Fig. 4). So, extending by 2 kbp would not 
be enough for genes with long 3' UTR. 

Discussion 
Comparison of our method with the original TargetScan 
program  suggests  many  important  aspects  in  target 
prediction of microRNAs. First, using properly annotated 
3'  UTR database  is essential.  Extending  3'  UTR by  an 
arbitrary length  is  not desirable since  it increases false 
positives by introducing target sites outside the real UTR. 
Extension of 2 kbp was not enough for the case study of 
PTEN. We need a compromise between sensitivity and 
specificity. Selecting 3' UTR of reliable transcripts in the

ECgene or Acembly genes (D. Therry-Mieg et at. http://www. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly) database would 
be the best choice for human and mouse genomes at this 
point. However, this is not true for rat which has only -0.6 
million  ESTs  in  the  dbEST,  compared  with  5.64,  4.18 
million ESTs for human and mouse, respectively. Proper 
annotation of 3'  UTR is impossible in rat due to the draft 
quality of the rat genome and insufficient EST data. Their 
effect on target prediction of microRNAs is obvious as can 
be  seen  in  Fig.  2.  Number of rat transcripts  is appro(cid:173)
ximately  1/3  of  human  or  mouse,  and  the  number  of 
microRNA:target pairs are reduced to 1/5 in rat.  It might be 
better  to  compare  just  human  and  mouse  genomes, 
waiting for the rat genome map to be more complete. This 
would increase the number of target genes substantially. 
Alternatively,  one may extend the 3'  UTR of  rat  by the 
amount  inferred  by  human  and  mouse  homologs,  not 
beyond the gap position. 

Another important aspect is the conservation of target 
sites in different organisms. As seen in  Fig. 3 and 4, the 
extent  of conservation  varies  significantly inside the 3' 
UTR,  which  is  not taken  into  consideration  in  previous 
studies.  It  would  be  better to  count  the  target  binding 
sites  within  the  tightly  conserved  blocks  only.  Two 
comparative  genomics  tracks-PhyloHMM  and  Blastz 
tight  - in  the  UCSC  genome  browser  should  be  good 
candidates (Schwartz et at.,  2003; Siepel et at.,  2004a). 
We  used  the  tight  tracks  for  convenience  since  it 
provides pairwise comparison of genomes. 

Recent study of Yekta et at.  identified HOXB8 as the 
target of hsa-mi R-196 (Yekta et at., 2004). The target site 
is  nearly  perfectly  complementary  to  the  microRNA. 
TargetScan  allows target  binding  with  mismatches and 
bulges, producing target sites of 42-43 nucleotides long. 
Interestingly, TargetScan could not locate the target site 
for hsa-mi R-196 because the target site has one mismatch 
in the 5' seed region (2-8 bp of microRNA). This suggests 
that  minor  mismatches  in  the  seed  region  should  be 
allowed in search of microRNA targets.
