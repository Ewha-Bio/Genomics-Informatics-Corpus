Abstract

Horizontal  gene  transfer  (HGT)  is  the  movement  of  ge-
netic  material  between  kingdoms  and  is  considered  to 
play  a  positive  role  in  adaptation. Cryptosporidium par-
vum  is  a  parasitic  protozoan  that  causes  an  infectious 
disease.  Its  genome  sequencing  reported  14  bac-
teria-like  proteins  in  the  nuclear  genome.  Among  them, 
cgd2_1810,  which  has  been  annotated  as  CysQ,  a  sul-
fite  synthesis  pathway  protein,  is  listed  as  one  of  the 
candidates  of  genes  horizontally  transferred  from  bacte-
rial  origin.  In  this  report,  we  examined  this  issue  using 
phylogenetic  analysis.  Our  BLAST  search  showed  that 
C. parvum  CysQ  protein  had  the  highest  similarity  with 
that  of  proteobacteria.  Analysis  with  NCBI’s  Conserved 
Domain  Tree  showed  phylogenetic  incongruence,  in  that 
C. parvum  CysQ  protein  was  located  within  a  branch  of 
proteobacteria  in  the  cd01638  domain,  a  bacterial  mem-
ber  of  the  inositol  monophosphatase  family.  According 
to  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG) 
pathway,  the  sulfate  assimilation  pathway,  where  CysQ 
plays  an  important  role,  is  well  conserved  in  most  eu-
karyotes  as  well  as  prokaryotes.  However,  the  Apicom-
plexa,  including  C. parvum,  largely  lack  orthologous 
genes  of  the  pathway,  suggesting  its  loss  in  those  pro-
tozoan  lineages.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that C. parvum 
regained  cysQ  from  proteobacteria  by  HGT,  although  its 
functional  role  is  elusive.

Introduction

Horizontal  gene  transfer  (HGT)  is  the  movement  of  ge-
netic  material  between  different  species  of  interkingdom, 
and  lateral  gene  transfer  is  for  intrakingdom  movement

[1].  The  concept  for  gene  transfer  was  first  mentioned 
for  an  acquisition  of  virulence  between  bacterial  strains 
[2],  and  then,  transfers  of  multiple  drug  resistance  be-
tween  Shigellae  and  Escherichia coli  strains  were  re-
ported  in  Japan  [3]. 
    It  is  important  to  note  that  HGT  not  only  affects  cor-
rect  reconstruction  of  a  phylogenetic  tree  but  also  helps 
to  understand  reasons  of  its  occurrence.  In  bacteria,  it 
is  widely  known  that  genetic  material  of  antibiotic  resist-
ance  is  transferred  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract  [4],  and 
in  the  case  of  unicellular  eukaryotes,  such  as  Giardia 
lamblia, Trichomonas vaginalis,  and  Entamoeba histo-
lytica,  the  organisms  that  use  fermentation  or  anaerobic 
metabolism  in  the  low-oxygen  environment  overcame 
the  environmental  stress  by  taking  genes  from  bacteria 
[5].  Moreover,  the  transferred  gene  plays  a  positive  role 
in  adaptation  to  a  pathogenic  way  of  life  [6].  On  the 
other  hand,  HGT  has  been  criticized,  in  that  its  bio-
logical  significance  is  overemphasized.  If  a  gene  has  an 
essential  role  and  participates  in  many  interactions,  its 
transfer  might  be  less  likely  to  occur  than  that  of  others 
or  would  be  detrimental  to  the  recipient.  Thus,  some 
transferred  genes  are  considered  nonfunctional  [7-9].
    Cryptosporidium is  a  parasitic  protozoan  of  the  phy-
lum  Apicomplexa.  Among  Cryptosporidium, C. parvum 
causes  an  infectious  disease  in  humans  and  animals 
with  diarrhea,  called  cryptosporidiosis.  Although  the  dis-
ease  is  prevalent  where  water  quality  is  poorly  man-
aged,  there  is  no  satisfactory  treatment  until  now  [10, 
11]. 
    Genome  sequencing  of C. parvum  was  completed  in 
2004,  identifying  major  metabolic  pathways  through  com-
parison  with  other  parasites  and  also  reporting  those 
enzymes  with  high  similarities  to  bacterial  and  plantal 
counterparts  [12].  In  some  crucial  biosynthesis  path-
ways, C. parvum  has  enzymes  that  originated  from  vari-
ous  organisms,  such  as  bacteria,  plants,  and  algae. 
Phylogenomic  analyses  predicted  a  set  of  genes  trans-
ferred  from  algae  and  eubacteria  [13]  and  promising 
drug  targets  in  nucleotide  biosynthesis  [14].  However, 
among  14  bacterial-like  enzymes  that  were  reported  by 
Abrahamsen et al.,  only  two  enzymes  received  follow-up 
attention  [15,  16]. 
    CysQ,  3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase,  also  known 
as  3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate  (PAPS)  3'- 
phosphatase,  or  3'(2'),  5'-bisphosphate  nucleotidase, 
was  among  the  14  bacterial-like  enzymes  initially  re-
ported  by  the  genome  analysis.  It  has  been  thought  that 

10 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  10(1)  9-15,  March  2012

it  is  needed  during  aerobic  growth  in  E. coli to  help 
control  the  levels  of  PAPS  in  cysteine  biosynthesis  [17]. 
Recently,  CysQ  protein  has  been  considered  as  an  im-
portant  regulator  that  modulates  the  sulfate  assimilation 
pathway  by  affecting  levels  of  intermediates  in  plants, 
fungi,  and  bacteria  [18,  19].  Despite  its  biological  im-
portance,  no  follow-up  phylogenetic  analysis  of  CysQ  in 
C. parvum  has  been  reported.
    In  this  study,  we  assumed  that  CysQ  might  have 
been  transferred  from  bacteria  to C. parvum  by  horizon-
tal  gene  transfer.  We  constructed  phylogenetic  trees, 
based  on  a  conserved  domain  of  the  protein,  and  in-
ferred  HGT  from  the  phylogenetic  incongruence. 

options  for  a  wide  range  of  species  [24].  We  queried 
PhylomeDB  and  downloaded  the  phylogenetic  trees  that 
included  CysQ  protein. 

Pathway  and  ortholog  analysis

CysQ  enzyme  was  found  in  sulfate  assimilation  on  sulfur 
metabolism  of  the  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and 
Genomes  (KEGG)  pathway.  The  list  of  organisms  that 
harbored  this  pathway  was  compiled  from  KEGG  orthol-
ogy  (KO)  (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html)  [25]. 

Results

Methods 

Sequence  source

Cryptosporidium  parvum  strain  Iowa  type  II  (NCBI 
taxonomy  accession  353152)  was  chosen  for  this  study. 
One  of  its  genes,  cgd2_1810,  encodes  CysQ,  a  sulfite 
synthesis  pathway  protein 
(accession  no.  XP_ 
001388206)  [12].  The  protein  sequence  was  retrieved 
from  the  NCBI  Protein  Database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/protein). 

BLAST  search

Sequence  similarity  searches  were  performed  using 
BLASTP  2.2.26+  [20]  with  C. parvum  CysQ  protein 
against  a  nonredundant  protein  sequence  database. 
TBLASTN  2.2.26+  [21]  was  performed  in  order  to  search 
for  the  orthologs  of  the  sulfur  metabolism  pathway  in 
the  C. parvum  genome  sequence  using  E. coli  and 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis  protein  sequences  as  que-
ries. 

Conserved  domain  analysis

We  obtained  information  of  conserved  domains  using 
the  NCBI  online  Conserved  Domain-search  tool  (http:// 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi)  and  Con-
served  Domain  Database  (CDD)  (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml)  [22,  23].  After  the  mat-
ching  CDD  model  and  the  corresponding  Conserved 
Domain  Tree  (CDTree)  were  identified,  the  CysQ  se-
quence  was  added  to  the  matched  model,  and  the  cor-
responding  CDTree  was  then  recalculated.

Phylogenetic  tree  analysis

PhylomeDB  is  a  collection  of  phylogenetic  trees  that 
have  been  precalculated  automatically  with  a  variety  of 

BLAST  for  sequence  similarity

The  BLAST  run  using  the  query  sequence  of  Crypto-
sporidium parvum  reported  the  proteins  of  the  genus 
Cryptosporidium  as  the  best  hits,  followed  by  those  of 
the  order  Eucoccidiorida,  the  genus  Cryptosporidium 
belongs  to.  The  next  best  hits  belonged  mostly  to  Gam-
maproteobacteria.  Their  gene  descriptions  corresponded 
to  one  of  the  alternative  names  of  CysQ  protein  or  a 
member  protein  of  the  inositol  monophosphatase  family, 
except  for  unclassified  proteins  and  hypothetical  pro-
teins.  The  best  bacterial  hit  had  an  identity  of  40%  and 
a  bit  score  of  181  bits  for  the  query  sequence  of  341 
amino  acids.  From  the  taxonomy  report  of  the  BLAST 
result,  11  organisms  among  110  were  eukaryotes,  and 
the  other  99  were  bacteria.  The  bacterial  list  was  com-
posed  of  59  Proteobacteria  species,  including  53  Gam-
maproteobacteria  and  31  Bacteroidetes  species.

Phylogenetic  analyses

While  the  BLAST  analysis  hinted  HGT  of  the  cysQ  gene 
from  bacteria  to  C. parvum,  the  hypothesis  should  be 
confirmed  by  phylogenetic  analysis.  A  phylogenetic  tree 
for  CysQ  protein  was  retrieved  from  PhylomeDB.  We 
chose  the  Phy0018DKQ_ECOL5  tree  made  by  the  E. 
coli protein  sequence  as  a  seed  and  maximum  like-
lihood  method  with  the  Jones-Taylor-Thornton  (JTT) 
evolutionary  model.  The  phylogenetic  tree  with  170  or-
thologs  comprised  three  eukaryotes-C. parvum,  Arabi-
dopsis thaliana,  and Oryza sativa-one  Archaea,  and  166 
Bacteria  species.  In  the  tree, C. parvum  was  branched 
with  Proteobacteria,  while  the  plantal  proteins  were  the 
outgroup  of  prokaryotic  proteins.
　In  OrthoMCL  (http://orthomcl.org),  CysQ  of C. parvum 
was  located  within  the  inositol  monophosphatase  family 
of  Pfam  (entry  name  OG5_129356)  [26].  This  ortholog 
group  has  only  70  orthologs  from  54  different  species 
and  paralogs  of  Viridiplantae  or  T. vaginalis.  Moreover, 

HGT  of  C. parvum  CysQ 11

it  included  a  larger  portion  of  plants  and  fungi  rather 
than  bacteria,  and  no  metazoan  protein  orthologs  were 
included.  Unlike  PhylomeDB  or  OrthoMCL,  the  CDD  of 
NCBI  cataloged  proteins  sharing  CysQ  or  related  do-
mains  comprehensively.
    CysQ  protein  of C. parvum  contains  a  CysQ  domain 
(accession  no.  cd01638),  which  is  one  of  the  children  of 
the  Fig  (FBPase/inositol  monophosphatase  [IMPase]/ 
glpX-like  domain)  superfamily.  The  Fig  superfamily  is  a 
metal-dependent  phosphatase  that  organizes  two  sub-
sets  of  direct  children  in  the  hierarchy  of  the  super-
family:  FBPase  glpX  domain  (cd01516)  and  IMPase-like 
domain  (cd01637).  Cd01637  has  9  children  domains: 
CysQ  (cd01638),  IMPase  (cd01639),  bacterial  IMPase- 
like  1  (cd01641),  bacterial  IMPase-like  2  (cd01643), 

IPPase  (cd10640),  FBPase  (cd00354),  Arch  FBPase  1 
(cd  01515),  Arch  FBPase  2  (cd01642),  and  PAP  phos-
phatase  (cd10517).  The  whole  hierarchy  tree  of  the  Fig 
superfamily  comprises  a  total  of  360  cellular  organisms: 
246  bacteria,  95  eukaryotes,  and  19  Archaea  (Fig.  1A). 
Some  domains  (cd01516,  cd01637,  cd01638,  cd01641, 
and  cd0643)  comprise  predominantly  bacterial  proteins 
in  their  CDTree,  whereas  the  other  domains  have  a 
combined  composition  (cd000354,  cd0517,  and  cd01639) 
or  a  high  level  of  Archaea  (cd01642  and  cd01515). 
Domains  cd01638,  cd01641,  and  cd01643  are  bacterial 
members  of  the  IMPase  family.  All  of  them  show  a  high 
proportion  of  Proteobacteria,  at  about  65%,  50%,  and 
43%  respectively.  In  cd01638, C. parvum  CysQ  protein 
is  located  within  the  monophyletic  gram-negative  sub-

Fig.  2.  A  simplified  sulfate  assimilation  pathway.  Inorganic  sulfate  is  converted  to  adenosine  5'-phosphosulfate  (APS)  by  ATP 
sulfurylase  (EC  2.7.7.4  and/or  EC  2.7.7.5,  Class  I).  APS  is  phosphorylated  by  APS  kinase  (EC  2.7.1.25,  Class  II)  to  3'-phos-
phoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate  (PAPS).  PAPS  is  either  transferred  to  3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate  (PAP)  or  recon-
verted  to  APS  by  3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphatase  (EC  3.1.3.7,  Class  III).

teobacteria,  to  Campylobacter jejuni,  Epsilonproteobac-
teria  (Fig.  1B).  On  the  other  hand,  the  gram-negative 
subtree  is  paraphyletic,  in  that  it  has  27  branches  of 
Proteobacteria  and  Aquificae,  Cyanobacteria,  and  Bac-
teroidetes,  respectively.  Taken  together,  the  phyloge-
netic  analysis  strongly  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the 
cysQ  gene  of C. parvum  may  have  been  acquired  from 
Proteobacteria  by  horizontal  gene  transfer.

Orthologs  on  sulfate  assimilation  pathway

CysQ  protein  participates  in  sulfate  assimilation  on  sul-
fur  metabolism.  In  Fig.  2,  we  show  a  simplified  version 
of  the  KEGG  pathway,  classifying  the  enzymes  into 
three  groups,  according  to  their  direction  and  steps: 
Class  I  for  EC  2.7.7.4  (CysN)  and  EC  2.7.7.5  (CysD); 
Class  II  for  EC  2.7.1.25  (CysC);  and  Class  III  for  EC 
3.1.3.7  (CysQ).  If  CysQ  of C. parvum  is  a  true  CysQ  en-
zyme,  playing  a  role  in  sulfate  assimilation  in  the  para-
site,  the  other  components  of  the  pathway  should  be 
present  in  it.  On  the  contrary,  we  could  not  identify 
such  genes  in  the  annotated  gene  list.
    The  KEGG  pathway  did  not  list C. parvum  proteins  in 
the  sulfate  assimilation  pathway.  We  looked  for  the  C. 
parvum  proteins  by  searching  the  genome  sequence  us-
ing  TBLASTN  with  M. tuberculosis  CysN  (Rv1286)  and 
CysD  (Rv1285)  and E. coli  CysN  (b2751),  CysD  (b2752), 
and  CysC  (b2750)  proteins  as  queries. 
    Among  class  I  and  II  proteins,  only  CysN  showed 
marginal  matches  to  cgd6_3990  (29%  and  33%  identi-
ties,  respectively)  to  M. tuberculosis  and  E. coli  se-
quences.  Interestingly,  this  C. parvum  protein  was  re-
ported  as  elongation  factor  1  alpha,  not  a  sulfate  ade-
nylyltransferase.  This  protein  had  high  similarities  to  oth-
er  protozoan  or  fungal  elongation  factor  1  alpha  pro-
teins.  Thus,  we  consider  this  as  a  false  hit.  The  class 
III  protein,  CysQ,  matched  to  cgd2_1810  (24%  and  36% 
identities,  respectively,  for  M. tuberculosis  and  E. coli

ing  the  KO  database  (Table  1). 
    Eukaryotic  kingdoms,  except  for  protists  harbored  full 
ranges  of  orthologs  in  all  three  classes.  Animals  and 
plants  showed  similar  trends  in  Class  I  and  II,  because 
two  classes  shared  two  orthologs  (K13811:  3'-phos-
phoadenosine  5'-phosphosulfate  synthase 
[PAPSS], 
K00955:  bifunctional  enzyme  CysN/CysC  [CysNC]),  and 
even  K13811  is  specialized  in  animals  and  plants.  Fungi 
also  have  many  orthologs,  like  animals  and  plants,  in 
Class  I  and  II,  but  they  have  different  orthologs  (Class 
I,  K00958,  sulfate  adenylyltransferase  [E2.7.7.4C,  met3]; 
Class  II,  K00860,  adenylylsulfatekinase  [CysC]). 
    In  prokaryotes,  the  proportion  of  Class  I  genes  is 
higher  than  Class  II.  All  Cyanobacteria,  two-thirds  of 
Proteobacteria,  and  Actinobacteria  contained  one  of  the 
orthologs  in  Class  I,  whereas  Firmicutes,  other  bacteria, 
and  the  Archaea  group  have  a  few  orthologs  in  Class 
I,  II,  and  III. 
    On  the  other  hand,  there  were  very  few  orthologs  of 
the  sulfate  assimilation  pathway  in  protists.  We  ex-
panded  the  protist  lineage,  cataloging  the  proteins  at 
the  class  or  species  level  (Table  2). 
    Some  protists  (Choanoflagellates,  Entamoeba  of  Amo-
ebozoa,  and  Diatoms)  had  at  least  one  orthologous 
gene  in  each  of  three  classes,  while  most  Alveolates, 
Amoeboflagellate,  Euglenozoa,  and  Diplomonads  did  not 
have  any  orthologs  in  three  classes,  many  of  which  are 

known  as  parasites  causing  infectious  diseases. 
    While  the  sulfate  assimilation  pathway  is  generally  well 
conserved  in  both  prokaryotes  and  eukaryotes,  in  some 
protist  lineages,  the  pathway  is  missing.  Thus,  we  hy-
pothesize  that  the  pathway  may  have  been  lost  during 
the  evolution  of  the  lineages.  C. parvum,  like  other 
Aveolates,  also  may  have  lost  it,  and  cge2_1810  can 
not  function  as  CysQ  properly.  Its  function  remains  elu-
sive,  as  the  sequence  similarity  to  CysQ  of  M. tuber-
culosis  or  E. coli  is  rather  low.

Discussion

A  BLAST  search  of  C. parvum  CysQ  (cgd2_1810)  pro-
tein  shows  the  highest  similarity  with  those  of  prote-
obacteria.  Although  it  implies  HGT  from  bacteria  to  this 
eukaryote,  sequence  similarity  alone  is  not  enough  as  its 
basis  for  several  known  reasons  [27].
    In  addition,  a  phylogenetic  analysis  should  support  it. 
For  this,  initially,  we  relied  on  the  tree  built  by  Phylo-
meDB.  However,  its  species  coverage  was  biased  or 
undersampled.  On  the  other  hand,  CDD  of  NCBI  is  well 
subdivided  into  kingdom  and  function  groups.  C. par-
vum  CysQ  protein  was  mapped  into  the  subfamily  of 
IMPase,  which  is  a  bacterial  CysQ  domain,  and  com-
prises  only  bacterial  sequences.  Furthermore, C. parvum 
was  located  near  Gamma-  and  Alphaproteobacteria  in 

14 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  10(1)  9-15,  March  2012

the  CDTree.  Hence,  it  seems  that  these  results  demon-
strate  that  gene  transfer  events  occurred  from  bacteria 
to  C. parvum  in  the  evolutionary  process. 
    On  the  KEGG  pathway,  we  raise  the  possibility  that 
Alveolates,  Euglenozoa,  and  Diplomonads  of  protozoa 
suffered  from  the  losses  of  genes  in  the  sulfate  assim-
ilation  pathway.  But,  did C. parvum  recover  CysQ  pro-
tein  by  HGT  in  the  process  of  evolution?  Sulfate  assim-
ilation  shows  highly  conserved  orthologs  for  each  taxon-
omy  lineage,  and  it  plays  important  roles  in  sulfur  me-
tabolism,  whereas  Alveolates  of  protozoa,  including 
Cryptosporidium,  rarely  have  orthologous  genes.  For  the 
pathogenic  bacterium  M. tuberculosis,  sulfur-containing 
metabolites  are  essential  to  its  pathogenesis  and  persis-
tence  in  the  host  [18,  28],  and  the  Database  of  Essential 
Genes  (DEG)  lists  that  Rv1286  (cysN)  and  Rv1285 
(cysD),  not  Rv2131c  (cysQ),  are  essential  genes  in  sulfur 
metabolism  of M. tuberculosis  [29,  30].  Parasitic  proto-
zoa  have  diverse  sulfur-containing  amino  acid  metabo-
lism  that  are  considered  to  affect  virulence  and  several 
stress  response.  On  the  other  hand,  C. parvum  and 
Plasmodium falciparum lack  a  sulfur  assimilation  path-
way,  which  is  expected  to  be  substituted  from  host  cells 
[31]. 
    In  conclusion,  although  the  sulfate  assimilation  path-
way  is  missing  in  some  protest  lineages, C. parvum  has 
a  protein  that  is  predicted  as  CysQ  and  has  sequence 
similarity  with  that  of  proteobacteria,  gram-negative  bac-
teria.  Moreover,  the  phylogenetic  analysis  supports  the 
acquisition  of  cgd2_1810  from  proteobacteria  through 
horizontal  gene  transfer.  Therefore,  we  can  infer  that C. 
parvum  lost  its  genes  in  the  sulfate  assimilation  path-
way,  including cysQ,  during  a  parasitic  way  of  life,  and 
it  acquired  a  copy  of  cysQ  from  bacteria  by  horizontal 
gene  transfer.  What  is  the  biological  role  of  this  gene 
product?  As  the  sole  member,  without  other  members, 
of  the  pathway,  it  can  not  assume  the  right  role  of 
CysQ.  Its  function  is  elusive  at  the  moment.
