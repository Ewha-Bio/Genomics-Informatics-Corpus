Metabolic  syndrome  (MetS)  is  a  complex  disorder  related  to  insulin  resistance,  obesity,  and  inflammation.  Genetic  and 
environmental factors also contribute to the development of MetS, and through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), 
important  susceptibility  loci  have  been  identified.  However,  GWASs  focus  more  on  individual  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), explaining only a small portion of genetic heritability. To overcome this limitation, pathway analyses 
are  being  applied  to  GWAS  datasets.  The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  elucidate  the  biological  pathways  involved  in  the 
pathogenesis of MetS through pathway analysis. Cohort data from the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) was used for 
analysis, which include 8,842 individuals (age, 52.2 ± 8.9 years; body mass index, 24.6 ± 3.2 kg/m2). A total of 312,121 
autosomal  SNPs  were  obtained  after  quality  control.  Pathway  analysis  was  conducted  using  Meta-analysis  Gene-Set 
Enrichment of Variant Associations (MAGENTA) to discover the biological pathways associated with MetS. In the discovery 

phase, SNPs from chromosome 12, including rs11066280, rs2074356, and rs12229654, were associated with MetS (p ＜ 5 
× 10-6), and rs11066280 satisfied the Bonferroni-corrected cutoff (unadjusted p ＜ 1.38 × 10-7, Bonferroni-adjusted p ＜ 

0.05). Through pathway analysis, biological pathways, including electron carrier activity, signaling by platelet-derived growth 
factor (PDGF), the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase cascade, PDGF binding, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR) signaling, and DNA repair, were associated with MetS. Through pathway analysis of MetS, pathways related 
with PDGF, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PPAR signaling, as well as nucleic acid binding, protein secretion, and DNA 
repair, were identified. Further studies will be needed to clarify the genetic pathogenesis leading to MetS.

Introduction

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex disorder related 
to  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  and  cardiovascular 
diseases,  and  its  prevalence  is  continuously  increasing 
worldwide  [1,  2].  Insulin  resistance,  obesity,  and  inflam-
mation are major factors leading to MetS; however, the effect 
of genetic and environmental factors cannot be ignored [3]. 
Sedentary lifestyle, decreased physical activity, high caloric 
intake,  and  westernized  food  habits  are  environmental 
factors  leading  to  obesity  and  MetS  [4,  5].  Parental  and 

maternal obesity in early pregnancy is related to increased 
risk of childhood obesity, which could later lead to obesity in 
young adulthood [6, 7]. In addition, family history of obesity, 
insulin resistance, and T2DM can increase the risk of MetS, 
implying the importance of genetic contribution. Candidate 
gene studies in MetS identified genes involved in glucose and 
insulin signaling, such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), 
peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor    (PPARG), 
insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and genes involved in 
lipid  metabolism,  such  as  adiponectin  (ADIPOQ),  apoli-
poprotein  A5  (APOA5),  and  low-density  lipoprotein  re-
ceptor (LDLR) [3, 8-10]. Through genome-wide association

studies (GWASs), a larger number of candidate genes could 
be further analyzed, and important susceptibility loci were 
discovered,  including  fat  mass  and  obesity  associated 
protein (FTO) and the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (MC4R), 
which were associated with body mass index (BMI) [11, 12]. 
In another GWAS of MetS, the lipid locus at rs964184 was 
associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL)−cholesterol 
and  very  low-density  lipoprotein−cholesterol  [13].  In  a 
meta-analysis in Korea that used the GWAS results from the 
Korea  Associated  Resource  (KARE)  cohort,  susceptibility 
loci in 12q24.11 and 12q24.13 were associated with HDL- 
cholesterol levels, and genetic factors associated with osteo-
porosis and metabolic traits, such as T2DM, dyslipidemia, 
and obesity, could also be identified [14-16].

GWASs  have  their  strengths  in  screening  susceptible 
genes associated with complex diseases [17, 18]. However, 
GWASs  focus  more  on  individual  single-nucleotide  poly-
morphisms (SNPs) that meet a stringent statistical signi-
ficance, rather than explaining the interaction of genes, and 
they can only explain a small portion of genetic heritability 
[19-21]. In addition, due to its small effect size, certain SNPs 
in a GWAS that have been identified to be associated with a 
disease might not show up in another study of the same 
disease. This can be seen in two published studies of T2DM 
and Crohn’s disease, which could not find most of the proven 
susceptibility  loci  through  GWASs  and  succeeded  in 
achieving moderate significance after replication studies or 
meta-analysis [22, 23]. To overcome this limitation, path-
way-based approaches have been introduced to improve the 
interpretability of the GWAS. 

Pathway-based analysis integrates GWAS data with genes 
in the selected biological pathways or gene sets from prede-
fined human databases [19, 24]. The strength of pathway 
analysis is its large effect size and higher power to detect 
genes  that  might  have  been  missed  through  a  GWAS 
[24-26]. Pathway analysis, such as Meta-analysis Gene-Set 
Enrichment  of  Variant  Associations  (MAGENTA),  only 
requires  the  SNP  p-values  and  chromosome  positions, 
simplifying  the  analysis  of  GWASs  [27].  MAGENTA 
analyzes the statistical power of GWASs through integration 
of variant association p-values into gene scores, correcting 
for confounding factors, such as gene size, SNP density, and 
linkage disequilibrium properties [27]. Through MAGENTA 
analysis,  biological  pathways  associated  with  triglyceride, 
HDL-cholesterol,  T2DM,  and  BMI  have  been  identified 
[27-29]. Pathway analysis is a supplementary way to further 
analyze  the  results  of  GWASs.  However,  there  are  few 
studies that have used this approach to identify biological 
pathways associated with MetS in Asians. The aim of this 
study was to further elucidate the genomic data of the KARE 
cohort and to identify the biological pathways related with 

MetS through a pathway-based approach.

Methods
Subjects

The cohort data from the KARE were used for the analysis. 
The KARE project, initiated in 2007, is a large cohort study 
that  recruited  two  population  studies  from  the  rural 
Anseong and urban Ansan cohorts. We analyzed the data of 
8,842 individuals (age, 52.2 ± 8.9 years; BMI, 24.6 ± 3.2 
kg/m2). Anthropometric measurements, including weight, 
height,  and  waist  circumference,  were  measured  in  all 
subjects,  and  BMI  was  calculated  (kg/m2).  Systolic  and 
diastolic blood pressures (BP) were examined in all subjects. 
Fasting plasma glucose and lipid profiles, including serum 
total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, 
were measured after an overnight fast. Detailed information 
on the study protocol has been previously described by Cho 
et al. [16].

MetS was defined according to the modified Third Report 
of  the  National  Cholesterol  Education  Program  (NCEP- 
ATPIII) diagnostic criteria, which require the presence of 
three out of the five following factors: 1) abdominal obesity, 
defined  through  waist  circumference,  using  the  cut-off 
values for Asians (≥90 cm in men and ≥80 cm in women), 
2)  triglycerides  ≥ 150  mg/dL  or  being  on  lipid-lowering 
treatment,  3)  low  HDL-cholesterol  (men  ＜ 40  mg/dL, 
women ＜ 50 mg/dL) or being on lipid-lowering treatment, 
4)  systolic/diastolic  BP  ≥ 130/85  mm  Hg  or  being  on 
anti-hypertensive treatment, and 5) fasting plasma glucose 
≥ 100 mg/dL or previous diagnosis of T2DM or anti-diabetic 
treatment [30, 31].

Genome-wide association dataset analyses

Genotyping  was  done  using  Affymetrix  Genome-wide 
Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, 
USA).  Samples  with  gender  inconsistencies  and  low  call 
rates (＜96%) were excluded. 

Quality control (QC) procedures were performed using 
PLINK version 1.07 [32]. Samples were excluded if there 
was  a  high  missing  call  rate  (＞5%),  low  minor  allele 
frequency  (＜0.05),  or  significant  deviation  from  Hardy- 
Weinberg equilibrium (p ＜ 1 × 10-6). The total genotyping 
rate  of  the  remaining  individuals  was  99.58%.  A  total  of 
312,121  autosomal  SNPs  were  obtained  after  QC,  re-
presenting  8,842  individuals  (4,183  males  and  4,659 
females).  An  additive  model  was  used  for  the  analysis. 
Detailed information on the quality control procedure of the 
genotypes is described elsewhere by Cho et al. [16].

logical pathways or gene sets associated with MetS. Detailed 
information on this analysis is described by Segre et al. [27]. 
Briefly, the steps of MAGENTA analysis were as follows: 1) 
SNP association p-values and chromosome positions from 
the  GWAS  are  used  as  input;  2)  each  gene  located  at  a 
predetermined boundary is mapped to a single SNP; 3) based 
on the regional SNP p-values, gene scores are ranked, and the 
best  SNP  p-values  are  determined;  4)  gene  scores  are 
corrected  for  confounding  factors,  such  as  gene  size  and 
linkage disequilibrium-related properties; and 5) gene set 
enrichment p-values are determined by analyzing the gene 
sets  enriched  with  highly  ranked  gene  scores  and  the 
selected  biological  pathway  or  gene  sets  [27].  False 
discovery rate (FDR) was also identified through multiple 
test correction. Additional information, including 95th and 
75th  percentile  cutoffs  and  the  number  of  observed  and 
expected genes within each pathway, were also calculated. 
Since  75th  percentile  cutoffs  have  greater  power  in 
interpreting complex diseases that are highly polygenic, this 
cutoff value was used for our interpretation [27, 29, 33].

Results

A total of 8,842 subjects (4,183 men and 4,659 women) 
were  involved  in  the  study.  Of  them,  3,253  (36.8%)  had 
MetS. Clinical characteristics of subjects with and without 
MetS are shown in Table 1. Individuals with MetS were older, 
with  higher  BMI,  systolic  BP,  triglycerides,  and  fasting 
plasma glucose and lower HDL-cholesterol levels compared 
to subjects without MetS.

In the discovery set of the GWAS, three SNPs associated 
with MetS were identified, demonstrated in Table 2. SNPs 
from  chromosome  12,  including  rs11066280,  rs2074356, 
and rs12229654, had a p ＜ 5 × 10-6. From these SNPs, only 
rs11066280 satisfied the Bonferroni-corrected cutoff (un-
adjusted p ＜ 1.38 × 10-7, Bonferroni-adjusted p ＜ 0.05).

The top 10 significant biological pathways or gene sets 
associated with MetS at the 75th percentile cutoff are shown 
in Table 3. The pathways were as follows: electron carrier 
activity (gene ontology [GO] term), signaling by platelet- 
derived  growth  factor  (PDGF)  (Reactome),  mitogen- 
activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) cascade 
(GO term), PDGF binding (GO term), nucleic acid binding 
(protein  analysis 
through  evolutionary  relationships 
[PANTHER] molecular function), PPAR signaling (Ingen-
uity), negative regulation of gene-specific transcription from 
RNA  polymerase  II  promoter  (GO  term),  non-motor 
microtubule-binding  protein  (PANTHER  molecular  fun-
ction), protein secretion (GO term), and DNA repair (GO 
term). At the FDR level, although all pathways were above 
0.05, the pathway of electron carrier activity had an FDR 
value ＜ 0.1, and the pathways of signaling by PDGF and 
PPAR signaling showed an FDR ＜ 0.2.

Discussion

In  this  study,  through  pathway  analysis  of  MetS,  im-
portant pathways, including electron carrier activity, signal-
ing by PDGF, MAPKKK cascade, PDGF binding, nucleic acid 
binding,  PPAR  signaling,  negative  regulation  of  gene- 
specific  transcription  from  RNA  polymerase  II  promoter, 
non-motor microtubule binding protein, protein secretion, 
and DNA repair, were identified.

In the previous GWAS using KARE cohorts, rs11066280 
and rs2074356 in chromosome 12q24.13, near the chromo-
some 12 open reading frame, human C12orf51 (C12orf51), 
and  rs12229654  in  chromosome  12q24.11,  near  myosin, 
light chain 2 (MYL2) were identified to be associated with 
HDL-cholesterol,  hypertension,  T2DM,  and  dyslipidemia 
[14,  34].  Drinking  behavior  was  also  associated  with 
rs11066280 (C12orf51) in Korean men and Han Chinese [34, 
35]. In other published GWASs on BMI, important variants 

on loci near/in FTO, MC4R, and transmembrane protein 18 
(TMEM18) were associated with BMI, the latter also having 
a  strong  association  with  BMI  in  children  [36].  Genetic 
variants  in  zinc  finger  protein  259  (ZNF259),  lipoprotein 
lipase (LPL), and APOA5 were also associated with MetS 
[37].  In  the  GWAS  of  European  Americans  and  Finnish 
cohorts, APOC1 was related with dyslipidemia and central 
obesity,  and  the  gene  cluster  region  in  SNP  rs964184, 
near/in gene APOA1/C3/A4/A5, was associated with MetS 
[3, 38].

Through  MAGENTA  analysis,  pathways  related  with 
electron carrier activity and PDGF signaling and binding, as 
well as PPAR signaling, were identified as some of the top 
ranking  pathways  associated  with  MetS.  Electron  carrier 
activity may be related with electron transport activity in the 
mitochondria. Abnormal regulation of mitochondrial func-
tion  is  associated  with  factors,  such  as  reduced  electron 
transport  chain,  which  can  lead  to  insulin  resistance  and 
MetS  [39,  40].  In  obese  and  diabetic  patients,  fewer  and 
diminished  mitochondrial  electron  transport  enzymes, 
especially complex I, were observed in the skeletal muscle 
[41-43]. Defects in the electron transport chain can impair 
carbohydrate  metabolism,  affecting  the  tricarboxylic  acid 
cycle and limiting ATP activity, which could result in lactic 
acidosis [44]. In addition, mitochondria respiratory chains 
are major sites of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, 
and excess electrons can increase ROS, stimulating proin-
flammatory  processes  and  mutagenesis,  contributing  to 
mitochondrial dysfunction [40, 45].

Pathways related to PDGF binding and signaling and the 
MAPKKK cascade were also associated with MetS in this 
study. The PDGF signaling pathway has been identified to be 
associated with BMI [29]. PDGF is an important activator of 
cell proliferation and migration, mediated by the mitogen- 
activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, and PDGF signaling 
regulates angiogenesis [46, 47]. In animal studies, PDGF- 
mediated  pathways  played  a  crucial  role  in  healing  myo-
cardial  infarction,  myocardial  fibrosis,  and  defects  in  the 
pathway lead to prolongation of inflammation [48, 49]. In a 
human study, serum PDGF isoform b levels were lower in 
individuals  with  MetS,  while  increased  PDGF  expression 
with elevated urinary PDGF-BB was seen in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy [50, 51]. MAPK pathways are involved 
in adipogenesis and metabolic homeostasis, and defects in 
these pathways due to factors, such as oxidative stress, can 
lead to abnormal adipose regulation, insulin resistance, and 
obesity [52, 53]. In addition, increased MAPK signaling had 
a  detrimental  effect  on  -cell  function  and  insulin 
homeostasis, which could contribute to the development of 
MetS [54]. The PPAR isotypes PPAR-, -, and - play an 
important role in lipid and glucose metabolism [55]. PPAR- 

198

is expressed in tissues, including skeletal muscle and liver, 
regulating  lipid  metabolism  and  inflammatory  processes, 
whereas  PPAR-  and  PPAR-  are  involved  in  adipocyte 
differentiation [56]. Genetic variations in PPAR can affect 
glucose uptake, fasting glucose levels, and BMI [57-59]. In a 
GWAS  of  T2DM  in  a  Finnish  population,  variants  near 
PPAR- were associated with T2DM [60]. In a Korean study, 
polymorphisms in PPAR- were related with BMI and fasting 
glucose in non-diabetics [61].

Other pathways related with nucleic acids, such as RNA 
and DNA, as well as pathways of protein secretion were also 
associated with MetS. MicroRNAs regulate the action and 
secretion of insulin, as well as lipid metabolism, playing an 
important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, obesity, and 
cancer  [62-64].  Abnormal  expression  of  microRNAs  in 
pancreatic beta-cells affects beta-cell function and insulin 
secretion  [65].  MicroRNA  expression  is  also  related  to 
appetite control in the brain; neural signaling in the muscle, 
pancreas, and liver; and biological processes of lipid meta-
bolism, which are linked to obesity [65, 66]. In addition, 
microRNA-33 is an important regulator of lipid metabolism, 
regulating insulin signaling and fatty acid regulation, and 
may be a therapeutic target for treating MetS [67]. Mito-
chondrial  dysfunction  is  an  important  cause,  leading  to 
diabetes [68]. DNA damage in mitochondria and vascular 
cells can have a detrimental effect on mitochondrial func-
tion,  increasing  ROS  production  and  promoting  athero-
sclerosis [68, 69]. Variations in mitochondrial DNA can also 
lead  to  MetS,  hyperinsulinemia,  and  T2DM  [70-72].  In 
addition, insulin also regulates DNA repair, and a chronic 
hyperglycemic  state  can  damage  DNA,  contributing  to 
genomic  mutation,  which  can  be  associated  with  cancer 
[73]. Abnormal protein secretion can affect metabolic traits, 
proven through studies demonstrating increased secretion 
of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), and frizzled-related 
protein  4  (SFRP4),  associated  with  obesity,  insulin  re-
sistance, and abnormal insulin sensitivity [74-76]. Retinol- 
binding protein 4 (RBP4), expressed in adipocytes and liver, 
showed  a  positive  correlation  with  MetS  in  a  Chinese 
population,  associated  with  insulin  resistance  and  dysli-
pidemia [77, 78].

The exact association between the pathway of non-motor 
microtubule  binding  and  MetS  can  not  be  explained. 
However,  studies  have  shown  non-motor  microtubule 
binding sites to have an important role in mitosis and to be 
essential in the embryonic development of Drosophila [79]. 
More  studies  will  be  needed  to  elucidate  the  association 
between non-motor microtubule binding and MetS.

One  of  the  strengths  of  this  study  is  the  usage  of  a 
pathway-based approach to further analyze the KARE GWAS 
datasets. Pathway-based approaches of MetS in Asians are 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

relatively scarce. Therefore, this study might help further 
elucidate  the  pathophysiology  of  MetS.  Although  the 
pathways identified in our study did not show an FDR value 
＜ 0.05,  important  pathways  related  with  BMI,  lipid  and 
glucose metabolism, including signaling by PDGF and PPAR 
signaling, had an FDR ＜ 0.2. Other pathway-based appro-
aches  will  be  needed  to  further  validate  the  identified 
pathways. 

Pathway-based analysis has its strengths in improving the 
interpretability  of  the  GWAS.  However,  current  pathway 
analysis tools are limited in finding a well-defined pathway, 
and their isolated characteristics make it hard to combine 
them  with  other  analyses  [80].  In  addition,  the  limited 
knowledge  base  and  imprecision  of  gene  annotations 
restricts  their  usage  and  integration  with  other  analysis 
methods [81]. Therefore, these limitations will need to be 
improved  to  generalize  this  approach  and  increase  its 
applicability. 

In  conclusion,  through  pathway  analysis  of  MetS, 
significant  biological  pathways  associated  with  lipid  and 
glucose metabolism could be identified, and these results 
might contribute to the understanding of MetS.
