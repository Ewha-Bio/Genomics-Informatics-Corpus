DNA  microarray  and  next-generation  sequencing  provide  data  that  can  be  used  for  the  genetic  analysis  of  multiple 
quantitative  traits  such  as  gene  expression  levels,  transcription  factor  binding  profiles,  and  epigenetic  signatures.  In 
particular,  chromatin  opening  is  tightly  coupled  with  gene  transcription.  To  understand  how  these  two  processes  are 
genetically  regulated  and  associated  with  each  other,  we  examined  the  changes  of  chromatin  accessibility  and  gene 
expression in response to genetic variation by means of quantitative trait loci mapping. Regulatory patterns commonly 
observed  in  yeast  and  human  across  different  technical  platforms  and  experimental  designs  suggest  a  higher  genetic 
complexity of transcription regulation in contrast to a more robust genetic architecture of chromatin regulation. 

Keywords: epigenetic process, gene expression, quantitative trait loci, regulatory regions 

Introduction

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping has been widely 
used to discover underlying genetic factors that can explain 
particular phenotypes of interest. Thanks to DNA microarray 
technology, the expression phenotype of thousands of genes 
was associated with the genotypes across the whole genome 
in expression QTL mapping [1-7]. Recent advent of next-ge-
neration  sequencing  technology  has  enabled  a  genetic 
profiling  of  chromatin  traits  as  well  as  more  in-depth 
analyses of gene expression variation. Especially, the me-
chanisms controlling chromatin accessibility have been of 
particular  interest  because  of  their  importance  in  a  wide 
spectrum of DNA regulation processes. For example, Degner 
et al. [8] utilized DNaseI hypersensitivity assay coupled with 
high-throughput  sequencing  (DNase-seq)  to  map  geno-
me-wide chromatin accessibility to the genotypes across 70 
human individuals, for which a previous RNA-sequencing 
(RNA-seq)-based  expression  QTL  study  revealed  new 
insights into the genetic regulation of transcription [5]. In 
yeast, expression QTL mapping has been performed for the 
genetic  dissection  of  transcription  regulation  in  a  cross 
between  two  parental  strains  of  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae 

(BY4716 and RM11-1a) based on DNA microarrays [1, 2, 
9-11]. In order to generate a matched dataset of chromatin 
accessibility for this set of yeast individuals, we carried out 
Formaldehyde-Assisted  Isolation  of  Regulatory  Elements 
followed  by  sequencing  (FAIRE-seq)  for  a  total  of  96 
segregants from the cross of BY4716 and RM11-1a [12]. 

In this study, we sought to dissect the genetic architecture 
of the regulation of gene expression and chromatin acces-
sibility by analysing previous data generated in yeast and 
human based on different technical platforms and experi-
mental designs. Our main goal was to find differences in the 
overall  regulatory  structure  between  open  chromatin  and 
gene  expression.  We  were  also  interested  to  determine 
whether the two distant species, namely yeast and human, 
would be different in genetic regulatory architecture and to 
estimate  the  effect  of  the  technical  or  experimental 
differences  in  genotyping  and  measuring  the  quantitative 
traits.

cell  lines  were  used  for  DNase-seq  analysis  [8].  The 
genotype  of  each  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP) 
locus was estimated based on the Bayesian framework by 
means of the BIMBAM tool [15] and the genotype estimates 
were  made  available  at  http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/dsQTL_ 
data/GENOTYPES/.  We  first  selected  2,157,286  genetic 
markers (SNPs) with the minor allele frequency greater than 
30%.  To  reduce  complexity  and  ease  interpretation,  we 
focused on the genetic variants that can change the function 
of the protein (non-synonymous SNPs) or the abundance of 
the protein (SNPs associated with the expression level of a 
nearby  gene).  The  SIFT  tool  [16]  was  used  to  identify 
non-synonymous  SNPs.  We  performed  expression  QTL 
mapping as described below and identified SNPs that were 
–5) in cis (within 200 kb from the nearest 
associated (p ＜ 10
gene). Taken together, 7,211 SNPs were identified for QTL 
mapping. 

Processing of human gene expression data

RNA-seq data for 69 YRI lymphoblastoid cell lines [5] 
were  downloaded  from  http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/RNA_ 
Seq_data/results. A total of 18,147 genes were used after 
normalization to zero mean and unit variance. 

Processing of human chromatin accessibility data

DNase-seq data for 70 YRI lymphoblastoid cell lines [8] 
were  downloaded  from  http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/dsQTL_ 
data/MAPPED_READS/.  Sequence  reads  from  multiple 
replicates for each sample were combined and F-Seq [17] 
was run to identify the peaks of the reads from each sample. 
Statistical significance of the peak was determined by fitting 
the data to a gamma distribution to obtain the p-value (script 
–3 was used to 
obtained from the F-Seq authors). p  ＜ 10
identify significant peaks from each sample. The overlapping 
peaks across the YRI individuals were merged into a single 
peak by using the mergeBED command of BEDTools [18], 
resulting in a total of 265,130 accessible chromatin regions. 
For  each  sample,  the  number  of  the  DNase-seq  reads 
mapped to each region was counted and the read count was 
normalized  as  previously  suggested  [19,  20]  to  obtain 
normalized chromatin accessibility, which was then further 
normalized to zero mean and unit variance across the YRI 
samples.  Accessible  regions  falling  on  promoters  or 
enhancers were identified based on chromatin annotation by 
Ernst et al. [21]. A total of 45,781 chromatin regions were 
found to reside in active promoters, weak promoters, poised 
promoters,  strong  enhancers,  and  weak  enhancers 
annotated in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line. 

Processing of yeast data

Genotype and gene expression microarray data [10] used 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  2,  2015

in  previous  expression  QTL  studies  [1,  2,  9]  for  ＞100 
segregants from a cross between two parental strains of yeast 
(BY4716 and RM11-1a) were obtained. As previously sug-
gested [22], adjacent genetic markers with less than three 
genotypic mismatches across the yeast strains were merged 
into the average genotype profile, resulting in 1,533 unique 
markers. We employed the microarray dataset of normalized 
expression levels of 5,352 genes as previously used [10]. 
FAIRE experiments were performed based on the published 
protocol [23]. The FAIRE-seq data for the 96 yeast strains 
from our previous work [12] is available at the Gene Ex-
pression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number 
GSE33466. Briefly, we identified open chromatin regions in 
96 yeast segregants by means of F-Seq [17]. The overlapping 
peaks across the 96 strains were merged into a single peak by 
using BEDTools [18], resulting in a total of 7,527 accessible 
chromatin  regions.  For  each  sample,  the  number  of  the 
FAIRE-seq reads mapped to each region was counted and the 
read count was normalized as previously suggested [19, 20] 
to  obtain  normalized  chromatin  accessibility,  which  was 
then  further  normalized  to  zero  mean  and  unit  variance 
across the 96 segregants. 

Trans-QTL analysis

Sixty-three human samples were commonly present in the 
RNA-seq  [5]  and  DNase-seq  [8]  data,  and  96  yeast  seg-
regants in the microarray and FAIRE-seq data. Therefore, we 
used  the  common  samples  for  our  QTL  mapping.  Linear 
regression was carried out leading to 2,100,341 chromatin 
associations and 975,333 expression associations in human, 

Fig.  1.  Data  analysis  scheme.  Relationships  between  the  genetic 
regulatory  loci  and  the  quantitative  traits  (chromatin  accessibility 
or gene expression) were explored in yeast and human. Data from
different  experimental  settings  and 
technical  platforms  were 
integrated  into  a  unified  analytical  framework.  RNA-seq,  RNA-se-

and  110,802  chromatin  linkages  and  164,217  expression 
linkages in yeast at p ＜ 0.01. Genetic markers farther than 
200 kb from the nearest gene in human and 100 kb in yeast 
were identified to examine regulatory relationships acting in 
trans. For each trait (gene or accessible chromatin region) 
and  regulatory  locus  (genetic  marker),  the  number  of 
associations  or  linkages  was  obtained  and  divided  by  the 

total number of associations at a given p-value. 

Results and Discussion

For a systematic comparative analysis of chromatin re-
gulation and transcription regulation, we carried out QTL 
mapping in a unified analytical framework by applying the

identical statistical methods and criteria for open chromatin 
and gene expression data in yeast and human (Methods and 
Fig. 1). From the human chromatin accessibility data [8], we 
selected chromatin sites at the promoter or enhancer (as 
defined by Ernst et al. [21]). Yeast and human QTL mapping 
was different in the genetics setting (linkage vs. association) 
and technical platforms (DNA microarray vs. RNA-seq and 
FAIRE-seq vs. DNase-seq) (Fig. 1). 

We  selected  significant  trans-associations  based  on  the 
p-value  of  linear  regression  and  then  examined  the  dis-
tribution  of  linkages  between  regulatory  loci  (genetic 
markers) and quantitative traits (gene expression levels or 
chromatin  accessibility).  First,  there  were  particular 
regulatory loci that were associated with a large number of 
target chromatin traits but not with gene expression traits 
both in human and yeast (Fig. 2). Second, expression traits 
than chromatin traits were associated with a greater number 
of regulatory loci (Fig. 3). This trend was consistently found 
when varying p-values were used (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the 

number  of  targets  for  chromatin  regulatory  loci  is  more 
dispersed resulting in outliers with extremely many targets 
while  the  average  number  is  lower  as  compared  to  the 
pattern of expression regulatory loci (grey vs. white in the 
upper panel of Fig. 4). On the other hand, the number of 
associated  regulatory  loci  was  much  greater  for  gene 
expression traits in terms of the outliers and average as well 
(grey vs. white in the lower panel of Fig. 4). 

These findings can be interpreted as follows. There are a 
few  regulatory  hotspots  that  are  responsible  for  a  large 
number of chromatin sites. Most regulatory loci, however, 
tend  to  influence  fewer  chromatin  traits  than  gene 
expression traits. Different biological functions are expected 
between the promiscuous and specific chromatin regulators. 
On  the  other  hand,  gene  expression  seems  to  be  more 
reactive to genetic variation when judged by the number of 
associated regulatory loci. This may imply that transcription 
processes  receive  more  regulatory  inputs  than  chromatin 
regulation, in which case chromatin accessibility may not be

a good predictor of precise gene expression levels. There was 
a remarkable consistency of the data for two evolutionarily 
distant  species  across  different  technical  platforms  and 
experimental  settings,  thereby  supporting  the  biological 
implications of the findings while ruling out the possibility 
of technical artifacts. 

Based  on  these  findings,  we  propose  that  chromatin 
regulation  mechanisms  have  evolved  a  stable  genetic  ar-
chitecture  while  the  transcription  regulatory  network 
maintains high genetic complexity and connectivity and is 
more susceptible to mutations. First, the lower number of 
associations  per  chromatin  trait  suggests  that  chromatin 
structure  is  more  robust  to  genetic  perturbation.  On  the 
contrary,  gene  expression  traits  have  more  associations, 
increasing the probability of targets being associated with 
mutations. Second, chromatin associations are biased to a 
handful of loci responsible for an extremely large number of 
chromatin sites. As long as these hotspot loci are protected 
from mutations, the perturbation of chromatin regulation 
architecture could be minimized. In contrast, the average 
number of associations is high for transcription regulatory 
loci, increasing the overall effect of single mutations. Given 
the higher probability of expression traits being associated 
with  mutations  and  the  greater  influence  of  individual 
mutations on transcription, it is conceivable that phenotypic 
diversity is more likely to be created in response to genetic 
variation at the level of transcription processes downstream 
of chromatin regulation steps.
