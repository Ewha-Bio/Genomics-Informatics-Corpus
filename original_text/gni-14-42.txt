Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) technique was adopted into clinical practices, revolutionary advances in diagnosing 
rare genetic diseases have been achieved through translating genomic medicine into precision or personalized management. 
Indeed, several successful cases of molecular diagnosis and treatment with personalized or targeted therapies of rare genetic 
diseases have been reported. Still, there are several obstacles to be overcome for wider application of NGS-based precision 
medicine, including high sequencing cost, incomplete variant sensitivity and accuracy, practical complexities, and a shortage 
of available treatment options.

Introduction

Next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  has  achieved  great 
advances in medicine and clinical practice, as well as in basic 
research  field.  NGS-based  precision  medicine  has  mainly 
focused on cancer [1, 2], given the prevalence, availability of 
drugs  targeting  major  oncogenic  factors,  and  impact  on 
human health. Another sector of focus through NGS-based 
precision medicine is ultra-rare diseases. 

Ultra-rare diseases can be defined as disorders that occur 
with a prevalence of below 1 in 2,000,000, although this 
frequency cutoff can be flexible [3]. Usually, rare disease 
research  is  performed  with  large  families  for  traits  with 
dominant inheritance [4, 5] or patient-parent trios for spon-
taneous cases [6]. Discovery of causative genetic variants 
using  whole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  or  whole  genome 
sequencing (WGS) should be followed by in vitro or in vivo 
model functional studies to fully explain the molecular basis 
of the diseases and confirm the functionality of the variants 
[4-7]. 

It is presumed that a large portion of ultra-rare diseases 
are caused by de novo mutations occurring at functionally 
important protein coding regions (Fig. 1) [8, 9]. Every human 

zygote  is  expected  to  have  approximately  70–80  de  novo 
mutations in its genome, and this poses a small chance to 
have ultra-rare diseases, depending on the position where 
the de novo mutations lie [8, 10].

Since NGS was adopted into medical genetics, the number 
of rare disease-causing gene discoveries has been increasing 
rapidly, and the genetics of many idiopathic diseases have 
been  elucidated  [11-13].  In  this  review,  we  present  the 
perspectives  gained  from  recent  studies  on  ultra-rare 
diseases diagnosed by NGS and successful treatments and 
discuss  the  potential  obstacles  for  wider  application  of 
NGS-based precision medicine. 

Cystic Fibrosis

Although  cystic  fibrosis  is  not  an  ultra-rare  disease  by 
definition, it presents a good example of precision medicine. 
Typically  inherited  in  an  autosomal  recessive  manner, 
patients carry two non-functional alleles of cystic fibrosis 
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Recently, an 
NGS-based diagnostic assay to detect mutations in CFTR was 
authorized  for  marketing  by  the  United  States  Food  and 
Drug  Administration  (FDA)  [14].  In  addition,  ivacaftor 
(Kalydeco, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA),

a  potentiator  of  CFTR,  and  lumacaftor  (Orkambi,  Vertex 
Pharmaceuticals; combination drug with ivacaftor), a cor-
rector of CFTR, were approved by the FDA for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis patients with nonsynonymous mutations 
(http://www.kalydeco.com)  and  the  F508del  mutation 
(http://www.orkambi.com),  respectively  [15].  NGS-based 
assays have made it possible to detect certain mutations that 
can  be  successfully  treated  by  mutation-specific  drugs 
(Table 1) [16]. 

Clinical  Practices  with  NGS-Based  Precision 
Medicine

The famous case of Nick Volker exemplifies the beneficial 
effect  of  NGS  techniques  on  patients  with  atypical  and 
undiagnosed disorders [17]. The cause of his fatal bowel 
inflammation and colocutaneous fistula turned out to be a 
mutation  in  the  X-linked  inhibitor  of  apoptosis  protein 
(XIAP) gene by WES, which has important roles in infla-
mmatory signaling and immunity. His disease was almost 
cured by cord blood transplantation. Following this, a few

more cases of precision medicine supported by NGS have 
been  reported.  WGS  of  14-year-old  twins  with  dopa 
(3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine)-responsive dystonia revealed 
compound  heterozygous  mutations  in  the  sepiapterin 
reductase (SPR) gene, encoding sepiapterin reductase. Dis-
ruption  of  the  enzyme  caused  a  decrease  in  the  neuro-
transmitters dopamine and serotonin, and administration of 
L-dopa  with  5-hydroxytryptophan,  a  serotonin  precursor, 
led to clinical improvements in both twins [18]. Another 
case was a cancer: the serine/threonine protein kinase B-raf 
(BRAF)  V600E  mutation  in  metastatic  rhabdoid  meni-
ngioma was found by targeted NGS in a 6-year-old girl [19]. 
She was successfully treated with dabrafenib, a BRAF inhi-
bitor. 

Most recently, a more dramatic case was of a 14-year-old 
girl who had suffered from autoimmune enteropathy since 
she was 3 months old [6]. A novel de novo mutation in the 
ligand binding domain of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 
(CTLA-4) was discovered by WES (Fig. 2) [6, 20, 21]. The 
mutation was presumed to be causative after several in vitro 
immunological experiments. Abatacept, an FDA-approved 
fusion protein of the extracellular domain of CTLA-4 and the 
Fc region of immunoglobulin for rheumatoid arthritis, was 
administered to the patient and restored regulatory T cell 
function. Clinically, treatment with abatacept without the 
need  for  other  immunosuppressants  reduced  diarrhea 
output by about 67% (from 3 L/day to 1 L/day). Markedly, 
blood transfusion was not necessary anymore, allowing the 
patient to be discharged from a 3-year-long hospitalization, 
merely needing partial parenteral nutrition. 

Prenatal Diagnosis

Prenatal  screening  and  prediction  of  ultra-rare  disease 
with  NGS  are  not  widely  used  yet  due  to  their  cost  and 
efficacy.  But,  if  the  parents  of  a  child  with  an  ultra-rare 
disease who was diagnosed by NGS plan to have another 
child, prenatal testing with DNA extracted from chorionic

villus sampling or amniocentesis is possible. If the cost of 
NGS declines, screening of rare genetic diseases with NGS 
might be routinely performed.

At this moment, a non-invasive prenatal test using NGS is 
rapidly being introduced to the clinical field, which allows 
the  detection  of  fetal  aneuploidies,  such  as  trisomy  21 
(Down syndrome) [22]. This technique uses cell-free fetal 
DNA (cffDNA) present in maternal circulation and enables 
non-invasive  liquid  biopsy,  in  contrast  to  invasive  pro-
cedures, including amniocentesis and chorionic villus sam-
pling. Although it is technically challenging to detect small 
nucleotide-level mutations from cffDNA at the present time, 
extensive  research  in  this  field  has  yielded  potential  in 
tackling the problem [23]. 

Obstacles to Precision Medicine and Future 
Direction

Despite  these  encouraging  cases,  there  are  wide  gaps 
between the diagnosis and treatment of ultra-rare diseases. 
Targeted and tailored therapies for ultra-rare diseases are 
usually hard, mainly because of scarce treatment options. To 
fill these gaps, several conditions should be fulfilled. First, 
the cost of NGS should decrease further. As of this writing, 
the cost of WES has fallen to under USD $1,000, which is 
still a formidable price for a routine application in clinics, 
while the usage of WGS may still be impractical. Second, the 

sensitivity and specificity of genetic diagnostics should be 
improved.  Current  commercially  available  exome  capture 
kits covers ∼99% of the RefSeq exome, and over 95% of the 
targeted bases are covered at least eight times with a typical 
WES run [24], implying that we are achieving fair exome 
coverage technically. However, the positive diagnostic rate of 
clinical  WES  for  Mendelian  phenotypes  remains  ∼30% 
[25], suggesting that a substantial portion of the remainder 
(∼70%)  might  be  caused  by  variants  located  outside  of 
exons or are not detectable by WES. Although the majority of 
functionally critical and disease-causing mutations occurs in 
protein-coding regions, the vast majority of the genome is 
non-coding  and  may  contain  variants  with  functional 
significance  that  has  been  neglected.  Third,  processes  of 
NGS data generation should be more simplified. Currently, 
the  typical  NGS  pipeline  consists  of  library  preparation, 
sequencing,  and  multiple  analysis  steps,  including  read 
alignments,  variant  calling,  and  annotation.  For  NGS  to 
pervade  in  clinical  practice,  the  processes  from  DNA 
samples to the final results should be more concise. In this 
context, nanopore sequencing techniques, such as MinION, 
could  function  as  a  good  alternative  to  current  NGS 
technologies  if  they  improve  the  high  error  rates  and 
relatively small-scale data output [26]. Fourth, more treat-
ment  options,  such  as  targeted  drugs  and  gene  therapy 
strategies,  should  be  provided.  The  metastatic  rhabdoid 
meningioma  with  a  BRAF  mutation  and  CTLA-4  cases 
mentioned  above  are  rather  exceptional  cases,  since  the 
genetic alterations were already targeted through comme-
rcially available drugs. Nevertheless, the CTLA-4 case is a 
good example of drug repositioning, which can be an efficient 
option to accelerate treatments for ultra-rare diseases, given 
its shorter development time and lower cost [27].

Conclusion

Although  they  are  given  less  clinical  attention  and 
researched less often, ultra-rare diseases have been occurring 
constantly,  because  every  new  baby  will  have  de  novo 
mutations  in  its  genome,  posing  a  small  chance  of  the 
mutations causing an unseen phenotype. Thus, it would be 
important to improve prompt and accurate diagnoses and 
suggest appropriate treatment options for ultra-rare disease 
patients. Although we still face many technical difficulties to 
address—such  as  the  high  price  of  NGS,  imperfect  NGS 
technology, practical complexities, and a shortage of treat-
ment options—the several cases illustrated here demonstrate 
successful application of NGS-based precision medicine for 
ultra-rare diseases, benefiting patient care in the long term. 
In the near future, NGS will be an essential component in 
precision medicine regarding its high throughput and rela-
