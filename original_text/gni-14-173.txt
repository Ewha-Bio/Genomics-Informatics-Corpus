The  meta-analysis  has  become  a  widely  used  tool  for  many  applications  in  bioinformatics,  including  genome-wide 
association studies. A commonly used approach for meta-analysis is the fixed effects model approach, for which there are 
two popular methods: the inverse variance-weighted average method and weighted sum of z-scores method. Although 
previous studies have shown that the two methods perform similarly, their characteristics and their relationship have not 
been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we investigate the optimal characteristics of the two methods and show the 
connection between the two methods. We demonstrate that the each method is optimized for a unique goal, which gives us 
insight into the optimal weights for the weighted sum of z-scores method. We examine the connection between the two 
methods  both  analytically  and  empirically  and  show  that  their  resulting  statistics  become  equivalent  under  certain 
assumptions. Finally, we apply both methods to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data and demonstrate that the

Introduction

The meta-analysis is a tool for pooling information from 
multiple independent studies [1-4]. In the field of genetics, 
the meta-analysis has become a popular way of aggregating 
information from multiple genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs) in order to increase statistical power while con-
trolling for the rate of false positive findings [5-13]. The meta- 
analysis has also become a useful tool for many applications 
of bioinformatics, such as neuroimage processing [14] and 
expression quantitative trait loci analysis [15]. 

There exist several approaches for combining information 
from multiple studies. Statistical methods can differ depen-
ding on the scenario: when (1) test statistics are unknown 
but only p-values are available, (2) test statistics are known 
but data are not available, or (3) actual data are available. In 

this paper, we focus on scenario (2), which is a common 
situation in genetic studies. We note that for scenario (1), 
Fisher’s method for combining p-values is commonly used 
[16]. In scenario (3), we can combine actual data, which is 
rarely doable in retrospective studies or in genetic studies 
where transferring genotype data is difficult due to privacy 
issues. For scenario (2), which we focus on, the fixed effects 
model  meta-analysis  is  the  most  common  approach  for 
synthesizing test statistics from multiple studies [1, 17].

To perform a fixed effects model meta-analysis, there are 
two popular methods: the inverse variance-weighted average 
and  the  weighted  sum  of  z-scores  (SZ)  [2,  17,  18].  The 
inverse  variance-weighted  average  method  (IVW)  sum-
marizes effect sizes from multiple independent studies by 
calculating the weighted mean of the effect sizes using the 
inverse variance of the individual studies as weights. The 
weighted SZ method constructs a new z-score by calculating

a weighted sum of individual z-scores. It has been known 
that  the  sample  size  of  individual  studies  is  a  preferable 
weight  for  the  method  [10,  19,  20].  Although  several 
empirical evidence has shown that the two methods perform 
similarly [2, 17, 21], the characteristics of each method and 
the analytical connection between the two methods have not 
been thoroughly investigated. 

In  this  paper,  we  first  investigate  the  optimal  charac-
teristics of the two methods. We show that the two methods 
are optimized for different optimality criteria: IVW maximizes 
the likelihood function, which is equivalent to minimizing 
the estimator variance, and SZ maximizes the non-centrality 
parameter of the statistic, which is equivalent to maximizing 
the statistical power. This characterization gives us insight 
into the optimal weight for SZ; using only the sample size 
information as weights can often be suboptimal in terms of 
statistical  power  compared  with  using  all  information  as 
weights, such as minor allele frequencies. Although the two 
methods are optimized for different goals, we analytically 
demonstrate that the two methods become equivalent under 
certain assumptions that hold over a wide range of applica-
tions.  We  examine  this  connection  between  the  two 
methods both analytically and empirically. Finally, using real 
data  analysis  utilizing  the  Wellcome  Trust  Case  Control 
Consortium data, we demonstrate that the two methods can 
give distinct results in certain study designs.

Methods
Inverse variance-weighted average method 

We first describe the two methods for the fixed effects 
model meta-analysis: the IVW and weighted SZ. The fixed 
effects model assumes that all studies in a meta-analysis share 
a single true effect size [2, 18, 22, 23]. The underlying mathe-
matical model of the observed effect Xi can be shown as: 

    ,

(1)

where μ is the true effect size and ei (the deviation of Xi from 
μ) is the error in the observation and i = 1,2,…,C. In order 
to  integrate  multiple  observed  effect  sizes  X1,…,XC  from 
multiple  studies,  the  weighted  mean  approach  has  been 
suggested [22], 

 .


(2)

A  choice  of  weight  Wi  is  not  immediately evident,  but 
several attempts were made to identify the optimal weight of 
the  methods  based  on  empirical  evidence  [17,  20,  24]. 
Ideally, one needs to put more weight on the studies with 

more precision against studies with lower precision [3, 25, 
26]. When the sample size of each study is sufficiently large, 
we  can  assume  that  Xi  follows  a  normal  distribution 
approximately,  based  on  the  central  limit  theorem.  This 
applies  to  situations  where  the  data  themselves  are  not 
normal (e.g., binary), in which situation the test statistic still 
follows a normal distribution, as long as the sample size is 
large. In GWASs, this assumption holds easily, because the 
sample size is typically as large as thousands of samples. 
Note  that  all  derivations  in  this  paper  are  based  on  this 
normality assumption. Let SE(Xi) be the estimated standard 
error of Xi, and Vi = SE(Xi)2. It is common practice to consider 
the estimated variance Vi as the true variance. The inverse 
variance-weighted  average  effect  size  estimator  is  the 
weighted mean of Xi with the weights [22]:

Wi = Vi

−1.

Given these weights, the standard error of the average 
effect size  becomes SE() =   . The statistical 
significance can be tested by constructing a z-score statistic 
of  IVW  as  follows,  which  asymptotically  follows  N(0,1)

Weighted SZ

Another  popular  method  for  the  fixed  effects  model 
meta-analysis  is  calculating  the  weighted  SZ  from  the 
follows  studies.  Let  Zi  be  the  z-score  from  study  i,

the weighted SZ statistic is

By  the  characteristic  of  a  normal  distribution,  ZSZ  also 
follows  N(0,1)  under  the  null  hypothesis.  To  combine 
z-scores from multiple studies, a per-study sample size was 
suggested as weights of each study, as follows [2, 10]:

estimator (MLE). MLE has the following property, as shown 
by Greene [27]: if the sampling is from an exponential family 
of  distributions  and  the  minimum  variance  unbiased 
estimator (MVUE) exists, that estimator becomes the ML 
estimator  [27].  Thus,  by  this  property  and  under  these 
conditions, we can conclude that IVW achieves minimum 
variance, because IVW is the MLE and MVUE [27]. 

Optimality of SZ

SZ maximizes the non-centrality parameter
SZ combines z-scores from multiple studies to construct a 
new z-score. Therefore, in SZ, we are not interested in the 
estimator of Xi. Rather, we are interested in the statistical 
significance of the combined information. Thus, the goal of 
SZ is to maximize how much the z-score will be shifted from 
0  on  average,  which  is  often  called  the  non-centrality 
parameter. By maximizing the non-centrality parameter, we 
can maximize the statistical power of the test. Among all 
possible weights that can construct a weighted SZ, we want 
to find the weights that will maximize the non-centrality 
parameter. 

The optimal weights of the weighted SZ can be found by the 
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We will make an assumption that 

   .

(10)

That is, we assume that our z-score is defined as the effect 
size  estimate  divided  by  the  standard  error,  which  is  the 
common definition of a z-score. In some applications, there 
can be different ways to define a z-score statistic, and for 
those definitions, the connection between z-score and effect 
size  may  not  be  apparent.  However,  in  practice,  this 
assumption  holds  approximately  over  a  wide  range  of 
applications. Below, we will show that in the situation of a 2 
× 2 table, even if we obtain a z-score in a different way, it 
approximates a z-score that is obtained by using effect size 
and its standard error.

Under the fixed effect model assumption that assumes 
E[Xi] = μ, the z-score, Zi, follows a normal distribution ZSZ∼ 
N(λ,1), where λ is a non-centrality parameter with λ =

Results 

Below, we show the characteristics of the two methods 
and  the  connections  between  the  two  methods.  We  first 
show  that  each  method  is  optimized  to  meet  a  unique 
optimality criterion. Then, we show that the two methods 
are  connected,  by  using  both  analytical  derivations  and 
empirical simulations. Finally, we demonstrate a situation in 
which the two methods can give different results using real 
data.

Optimality of IVW

IVW maximizes likelihood function
We  will  define  that  a  method  is  optimal  if  the  method 
achieves  a  specific  goal  more  effectively  than  any  other 
method.  We  show  that  IVW  is  optimal  in  two  different 
aspects:  (1)  the  summary  estimator  gives  the  greatest 
likelihood than any other estimator and (2) the summary 
estimator’s variance is smaller than the variance of any other 
estimator. First, we show that IVW is optimal in the sense 
that the IVW estimator maximizes the likelihood function. 
Suppose that we have a series of n studies with observed 
effect sizes Xi, i = 1, 2, …, n. Under the fixed effects assump-
tion, there exists a true effect size μ, and each observation Xi 
comes  from  a  normal  distribution  with  mean  μ and  a 
standard deviation σi. The probability density function of 
each observation is given by

This  result  provides  us  with  the  intuition  that  SZ  is 
optimal only when we weight z-scores by the inverse of the 
standard errors of effect sizes. That is why previous studies 
have weighted z-scores by   , because in many applica-
tions, the variance Vi is inversely proportional to the sample 
size  Ni.  However,  we  would  like  to  note  that  in  some 
applications, the variance can be a function of not only Ni but 
also other properties of the data. For example, in genetic 
association  studies,  when  we  test  an  association  of  a 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to a phenotype, the 
variance  is  typically  inversely  proportional  to  Nipi(1−pi), 
where pi denotes the allele frequency of the risk allele. This 
suggests that if the datasets that we want to combine have 
different allele frequencies, weighting the z-scores only by Ni 
can be suboptimal. Below, we will show by simulations that 
we can have some power loss by using just Ni as the weight, 
instead of accounting for frequency differences. However, 
the approximation of this weight   will be optimal when 
no  heterogeneity  can  be  found  between  the  minor  allele 
frequencies [2]. 

Equality of IVW and SZ under certain assumptions

Analytical derivation
Here, we show that the two methods IVW and SZ are 
equivalent under certain assumptions. We have shown that 
IVW is optimal in the sense that the estimator is MLE and 
achieves minimum variance, and SZ is optimal in the sense 
that it maximizes the non-centrality parameter. Although 
both methods can be considered optimal, their goals and 
how they are optimized are completely different; IVW aims 
to  obtain  the  best  summary  estimate  (thus  MLE  and 
minimum variance), and SZ aims to maximize the statistical 
power, without considering the summary estimator. Despite 
the fact that the two methods are optimized differently with 
different  goals,  we  show  that  the  resulting  statistics  are 
equivalent, in the sense that their z-scores (and therefore 
their p-values) are equivalent. Again, we assume the defini-

Empirical simulation
To empirically investigate the equality of IVW and SZ, we 
compared the power of the two methods. We assumed the 
following null and alternative hypotheses:

H0:μ = 0
H1:μ ≠ 0

, ranging from 

That is, we tested if the mean effect is non-zero. 
To generate simulation sets of meta-analysis studies, we 
used  the  common  simulation  framework  for  simulating 
genetic  association  studies.  We  assumed  that  there  is  a 
single  SNP  whose  minor  allele  confers  risk  of  a  disease, 
which  is  a  dichotomous  trait.  We  assumed  a  number  of

1.01 to 1.2. We assumed a meta-analysis of 5 genetic associa-
tion studies and assumed a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 
0.3. In an additional simulation setting, we assumed varying 
MAFs of (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5) for the 5 studies. We assumed 
a  very  small  disease  prevalence  (F  ≈  0).  Given  these 
assumptions and parameters, we can calculate the expected 
MAF in cases and in controls. Specifically, given MAF p and 
relative risk γ, the case MAF becomes γp/((γ−1)p ＋ 1), 
where the control MAF becomes approximately p, given F ≈ 
0. Given the expected MAF in cases and controls, we could 
randomly sample genotype data, assuming 500 cases and 
500  controls  for  each  of  the  five  studies.  To  assess  the 
statistical significance of the sample data, we used log odds 
ratio  as  a  statistic,  which  follows  an  asymptotic  normal 
distribution. We repeated the procedure to generate 100,000 
simulated meta-analysis sets. Given the significance level α 
= 0.05, the power was the proportion of sample sets whose 
meta-analysis p-value was ≤α.
We compared the two methods—IVW and weighted SZ—
using the inverse standard error as a weight factor (SZ_SE). 
Fig. 1 shows that the two methods showed the same power 
in both situations: under no heterogeneity in MAF between

weights, wIVW,i ≠ wSZ_N,i), SZ_N showed a slight power loss 
from the other two methods (Fig. 1B). This result demon-
strates  that  using  only  sample  size  as  the  weight  can  be 
suboptimal if there are other factors that can cause variance 
differences  between  studies,  such  as  allele  frequencies. 
Nevertheless, the power drop of using only sample size as 
the weight was quite small (i.e., at γ = 1.15, the power of 
IVW and SZ_SE was 58.24%, but the power of SZ_N was 
57.23%, with only 1.01% power loss.)

Situations in which IVW and SZ can give distinct 
results

In this section, we demonstrate a situation in which IVW 
and SZ can give distinct results. As we have shown above, SZ 
−1(SZ_SE) is analytically 
whose weights are given as SE(Xi)
equivalent to IVW. However, SZ whose weights are given as 
the  square  root  of  sample  size  (SZ_N)  can  give  slightly

different results, if the expected relationship SE(Xi)
is broken. We have already shown that a MAF difference can 
result in such breakage of this relationship. Here, additio-

result in such breakage of the relationship SE(Xi)
We  used  the  data  of  the  Wellcome  Trust  Case  Control 
Consortium [28]. This dataset includes approximately 2,000 
cases for each of seven different diseases and 1,500 controls 
for each of two control groups (1958C and National Bureau 
of Standards [NBS]). We used the data on rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA)  and  type  1  diabetes  (T1D).  After  standard  quality- 
control and removal of the MHC region, we obtained 469,225 
SNPs. We performed association tests for two diseases; we 
performed association tests for RA using NBS as controls 
and association tests for T1D using 1958C as controls. The 
sample sizes for the two association tests were similar (N = 
3,318 and 3,443, respectively). We used logistic regression 
implemented  in  plink  (with--logistic  command).  Because 
the sample sizes of the two tests were similar, we expected 
that  for  each  SNP,  the  standard  errors  of  the  effect  size 
estimate would be similar. That is, we wanted to test if the 
−1∝ held well for these real data. Fig. 
relationship SE(Xi)
2A shows that when we plotted the log10 value of the ratio 
of the two standard errors, the values were highly concen-
trated around 0. This implies that the standard errors were 
very similar between RA and T1D, as expected, because the 
−1∝
sample sizes were similar. Thus, the relationship SE(Xi)
 approximately held well. Therefore, Fig. 2A shows that 
IVW and SZ_N have similar results in this situation.

Next, we changed the study design and used the linear 
mixed  model  implemented  in  the  software  package 
Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association (GEMMA). 
We used GEMMA for both T1D and RA. Fig. 2B shows that 
the standard errors of these two analyses were similar. Then,

the  values  deviated  dramatically  from  0  (Fig.  2C).  The

meta-analysis,  the  p-values  of  IVW  and  SZ_N  differed 
dramatically. Note that the standard errors given by GEMMA 
can  be  slightly  different  from  the  standard  linear  model, 
because GEMMA regresses the effect of population structure. 
However,  an  additional  analysis  comparing  the  standard 
errors of GEMMA and the standard linear model demons-

trated  that  this  effect  is  minimal  and  that  their  standard 
errors were similar (Fig. 3). Thus, the difference observed 
between  GEMMA  and  the  logistic  regression  model  was 
mainly due to the use of different models (linear and logistic).
One may argue that a meta-analysis design that combines 
the results of a logistic regression model and linear model is 
uncommon. Indeed, for binary traits, the use of a logistic 
regression model is more suitable. However, for dealing with 
population structure and cryptic relatedness, a linear mixed 
model is currently the main tool. For GWASs, there is no 
widely used efficient package implementing a logistic mixed 
model. For this reason, many studies are using a linear mixed 
model for binary traits as approximations. Therefore, if we 
assume  a  situation  that  the  effect  size  in  one  study  is

linear mixed model can be incompatible with the effect size 
from the logistic regression model. In such situations, the 
use of meta-analysis methods based on z-scores or p-values 
is recommended, because it is not sensible to apply inverse 
variance-weighted average to multiple incompatible effect 
sizes from different statistical models.

Discussion

In this paper, we investigated the optimal characteristics 
of  two  fixed  effects  meta-analysis  methods:  the  inverse 
variance-weighted average and the weighted SZ. We showed 
that the two methods are optimized with different goals, but 
they are equivalent under certain assumptions. By analytical 
derivations  and  empirical  simulations,  we  demonstrated 
their  equivalency  and  provided  insights  into  the  optimal 
weights for the weighted SZ. 

We  have  also  shown  that  the  optimal  weights  for  the 
weighted SZ can be a function of not only the sample size but 
also  other  properties—for  example,  allele  frequencies  in 
GWASs.  We  empirically  showed  that  if  allele  frequencies 
differ between studies, using only sample size for the weight 
can be suboptimal in terms of power. Therefore, we suggest 
that one should use effect size and standard error to define a 
z-score  and  use  the  inverse  of  the  standard  error  as  the 
weight  for  the  weighted  SZ.  The  standard  error  term  in-
cludes all information, such as sample size and allele fre-
quencies, thus providing optimal performance. Nevertheless, 
in our simulations, using just sample size resulted in only 
slightly lower power (at most, 1.07% power loss). Thus, in 
most applications, using only sample size for weights might 
perform reasonably well. 

We also demonstrated that in some situations, the two 
meta-analysis  methods  can  give  different  results.  Speci-
fically,  when  one  study  used  the  linear  mixed  model  to 
account for population structure, the effect size from the
