Recently, new methods have been developed for estimating the current and recent changes in effective population sizes. 
Based on the methods, the effective population sizes of Korean populations were estimated using data from the Korean 
Association Resource (KARE) project. The overall changes in the population sizes of the total populations were similar to CHB 
(Han Chinese in Beijing, China) and JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) of the HapMap project. There were no differences in past 
changes in population sizes with a comparison between an urban area and a rural area. Age-dependent current and recent 
effective population sizes represent the modern history of Korean populations, including the effects of World War II, the 
Korean War, and urbanization. The oldest age group showed that the population growth of Koreans had already been 
substantial at least since the end of the 19th century.

Introduction

Effective population size (Ne) is the theoretically useful 
population size of an ideal population, in which the influence 
of  random  genetic  drift  is  identical  to  that  of  the  actual 
population [1]. Therefore, the effective population size is a 
good representative  of  the  genetic potential of  the  actual 
population;  yet,  it  is  easier  to  handle  population  genetic 
problems.  There  are  several  kinds  of  effective  population 
size, depending on the focus of measurement [2-5], and the 
most  representative  ones  are  the  inbreeding  effective 
population size, the variance effective population size, and 
the  eigenvalue  effective  population  size.  The  variance 
effective  population  is  easy  conceptually,  and  it  can  be 
estimated based on the gene (or allele) frequencies [6, 7] or 
heterozygote excess [8]. In addition, the estimation can be 
based  on  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  [9],  and  advanced 
related methods based on LD have been applied to human 
genome data to infer the past population history of human 
populations [10-12]. 

Recently, new methods have been developed to estimate 
the current Ne and recent changes in Ne [13, 14]. In studies, 
the effective population size of the current generation was 

estimated based on deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equili-
brium  (HWE),  and  an  effective  population  size  of  recent 
generations  was  estimated  using  the  linkage  equilibrium 
(LE) between variants in different chromosomes [13]. The 
past population changes can be inferred from the LD decay, 
depending  on  recombination  rate  [14].  Different  from 
previous  methods  using  regressive  methods  [10-12],  the 
relationship  between  the  effective  population  size  of  the 
previous generation and that of the current generation [14] 
was  presented  by  improving  a  recurrence  formula  of 
previous studies [15, 16]. The applications of these studies 
to human genome data showed excellent agreement with the 
actual  recent  changes  of  various  human  populations  [13, 
14].

HapMap Phase III data were used for studies to infer the 
past  population  histories  of  various  human  populations. 
There were similar data for Korean populations (the Korean 
HapMap data) [17, 18]; however, for the continuity of the 
results,  the  data  were  not  included  for  the  analyses  in 
previous studies [13, 14]. In 2007, right after the Korean 
HapMap data, the Korea Association Resource (KARE) was 
initiated  to  enable  genomewide  analyses  for  8,842  indi-
viduals from the population-based cohorts [19]. The effort 
was  successful  in  revealing  new  and  population-specific

genetic factors of various traits [19-22]. The KARE data were 
also  provided  to  many  other  researchers,  which  yielded 
many  novel  findings  [23-30].  In  the  current  study,  the 
current and recent effective population sizes of Koreans were 
estimated, and the past changes in effective population sizes 
were  studied  using  the  KARE  data.  Different  from  the 
HapMap data, the KARE data contain many more individuals 
with their age information. In addition to the analyses of the 
total  population,  region-specific  and  age-specific  analyses 
were conducted in the current study.

Methods
Estimating Ne based on HWE deviations, LE 
deviations, and LD decay

Based on the formula for testing HWE [31], estimating 
the effective population sizes of current populations utilizes 
the deviations of HWE, as shown in Eq. (1) from a previous 
study [13].

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

If the haplotypes are derived directly from the genotyping or 
sequencing, the correction term due to sampling should be 
1/n.

The decay of LD between linked loci is different, depend-
ing on the recombination rate. Based on this information, 
the  past  population  history  can  be  inferred.  The  LD 
estimates  at  a  certain  recombination  rate  contain  the 
influences  of  all  Ne  values  from  the  current  to  a  certain 
number of past generations [14]. Therefore, the previous 
study showed that the changes of Ne estimates, depending 
on recombination rate, just represent an overall picture of 
past population history by comparing the actual estimates to 
the estimates of various past population histories. Similar to 
the  previous  study,  the  effective  population  sizes  were 
estimated  using  the  linked  variants,  depending  on  the 
recombination rates, between the variants (Eqs. 1 and 3–5). 
Following  the  previous  assumptions  [13,  34],  constant 
population sizes and LD at equilibrium were assumed.

where n is the sample size, and the expectation indicates the 
mean value of HWE deviations.  is the observed geno-
type frequency of a variant, and   is the observed allele 
frequency of a variant. The same as the HapMap data, the 
KARE data excluded variants that deviated from HWE for a 
significance level of 0.001. Therefore, similar to the previous 
study, the mean of the HWE deviations should be adjusted 
by dividing the mean by the correction term of 0.9873 [13]. 
A  variant  in  a  chromosome  is  in  LE  with  a  variant  in 
another  chromosome;  however,  the  random  genetic  drift 
induces deviation from LE. The deviations depend on the 
effective  population  size  of  recent  generations,  and  the 
recent effective population size can be estimated using the 
deviations.  Assuming  a  constant  population  size,  the 
effective  population  size  that  reflects  recent  changes  in 
population size (the recent Ne) can be estimated based on 
Eq. (2), which was derived in a previous study [13]. The 
estimate is different from the inbreeding Ne estimate using 
unlinked loci [9, 32].

where n indicates the sample size. As indicated previously 
[13],  the  correction  due  to  sampling  involves  1/2Ne,  in 
addition  to  1/n,  because  the  haplotype  frequencies  were 
estimated using maximum likelihood estimation [9, 33, 34]. 

Eq. (3) presents the relationship between LD estimates at 
equilibrium (r2
eq), Ne, and recombination rate (C). The LD 
estimates in Eq. (3) indicate the estimates of the original 
population, excluding the sampling bias. Sampling causes 
more complicated relationships in the LD estimates of the 
linked variants than the LD estimates of unlinked variants, 
due  to  the  maximum  likelihood  estimation  of  haplotype 
frequencies [14]. Therefore, as shown in Eq. (4), the LD 
estimates of sampled populations (r2
s) include the influence 
of  the  Ne  of  the  original  population  instead  of  a  simpler 
factor, 1/(2ns), in addition to the influence of sample size 
(ns) and the LD estimates of the original population (r2

o).

To  eliminate  sampling  bias,  the  Ne  of  the  original 
population should be known. It is possible to combine and 
solve Eqs. (3) and (4) for a given ns and r2
s. A better way is to 
use the Ne estimate of the current generation (Eq. 1) in the 
recurrent formula in a previous study [14]. By doing so, Eq. 
(5) was derived.

o indicates the LD estimates of the original population; 
and r2
eq indicates the LD estimates at equilibrium from the 
generation when the LD estimates reached equilibrium to 
the previous generation right before the current generation
−i.e., the parent generation. Therefore, to estimate Ne at 
equilibrium for a certain recombination rate, Nec should be 
estimated first. The estimated Nec is incorporated into Eq.

eq  with  the 
expression  in  Eq.  (3)  provides  a  cubic  equation  of  Ne  in 
which  Ne  can  be  solvable.  The  Ne  estimates  could  be 
examined,  depending  on  various  recombination  rates,  to 
infer past population histories in which the impact of current 
Ne was excluded.

Data

The  KARE  data  were  generated  and  kindly  provided 
through a grant program by the Korea Centers for Disease 
Control  and  Prevention.  The  data  consisted  of  a  total  of 
8,842 individuals: 4,637 from Ansan (an urban area) and 
4,205 from Anseong (a rural area) in Gyeonggi province. 
There were 32 groups depending on ages from 39 to 70, and 

the numbers of individuals in each of the 32 groups were: 21, 
421, 469, 489, 485, 473, 426, 400, 368, 291, 325, 268, 215, 
207, 241, 242, 259, 197, 225, 238, 231, 255, 239, 230, 232, 
254, 270, 210, 254, 200, 194, and 13, respectively. Because 
there were small numbers of individuals for the ages of 39 
and 70, they were combined with the age groups of 40 and 
69, respectively. Therefore, the total number of age groups 
was  30.  It  is  neither  necessary  nor  efficient  to  use  all 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), because estimat-
ing Ne does not require many variants. Only 10,000 SNPs or 
1,000 pairs of SNPs were enough to estimate the correct Ne 
in  the  simulations  of  previous  studies  [13,  14].  In  the 
simulation studies, the variances were least biased for the 
most frequent variants. Therefore, the same as in previous 
studies [13, 14], SNPs with minor allele frequencies higher 
than 0.4 and without missing genotypes were used for the 
analyses. The estimates of LD were the r2 estimates−i.e., the 
squared correlation coefficient between two variants.

Results

The current effective population size was 100,778 using 

Fig.  1.  Linkage  disequilibrium  decay  and  Ne  estimates  of  the  total  population,  the  population  of  the  urban  region,  and  the  population

the total population. The estimate was much larger than the 
estimates  using  the  HapMap  data.  The  largest  Ne  in  the 
populations of the HapMap data was 10,437 using CEUp 
(the  parents  of  Utah,  USA  residents  with  ancestry  from 
northern and western Europe). The estimate of the Korean 
population  was  approximately  10  times  larger  than  the 
largest  estimates  using  the  HapMap  data.  From  the 
definition,  the  effective  population  size  is  influenced  by 
many  factors,  such  as  mating  structure,  migration,  and 
admixture [1]. No big difference is expected in the mating 
structure  between  KARE  and  HapMap.  Because  Korean 
populations were relatively rarely admixed, the inflation of 
Ne  due  to  admixture  could  be  excluded.  The  effects  of 
migration on Ne estimates were studied previously [35, 36]. 
The Ne, based on LD, which is more robust than the joint 
estimation of Ne and migration rate, could be overestimated 
to  be  close  to  the  global  (metapopulation)  Ne  when  the 
migration rate is high [35].

After the Korean War, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) 
experienced  severe  urbanization  and  extreme  population 
concentration in a metropolitan area [37]. The percentage of 
the population in an urban area was more than 70% of the 
total population in the late 1980s [37]. A high population 
density due to migration introduces good opportunities to 
meet  a  diverse  partner  within  the  population,  which  in-
creases Ne. The population density of the Republic of Korea 
is among the highest among nations, ranking 20th among a 
total of 265 countries or areas (https://data.un.org/Data. 
aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A14). Due to the Korean 
War and urbanization, the Gyeonggi province, located in the 
middle  of  the  Korean  peninsula,  has  experienced  severe 
migration.  Because  the  capital,  Seoul,  is  located  in  the 
middle  of  Gyeonggi  province,  the  region  has  also  experi-
enced  a  severe  concentration  of  the  population.  These 
factors might explain the large effective population size. 

Fig. 1 shows the LD status of the total population, the 
population of the urban area, and the population of the rural 
area,  depending  on  recombination  rates.  In  the  previous 
study, the r2 decay plots of chromosome 14, depending on 
recombination rates, were prominently higher than the plots 
of other chromosomes [14]; however, in the current study, 
none of the Korean populations showed increases in the r2 
estimates of chromosome 14 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 
1 for the age groups). However, when the region from 65,700 
kb to 6,800 kb, which is responsible for the increases in the 
r2 estimates in the previous study, was examined, similar 
allele frequency spectra were seen (Fig. 2A). The frequency 
spectra  show  significant  concentrations  of  specific  minor 
allele  frequencies  (higher  than  0.4),  indicating  selection 
pressures in the region. Other populations in the HapMap 
data showed similar trends of selection pressures, but the

concentrated frequencies usually were less than 0.4 [14]. 

The most similar spectra among the HapMap data were 
JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan) and CHB (Han Chinese in 
Beijing, China), and the frequency spectrum of KARE looked 
like a mixture of the spectra of JPT and CHB. In a previous 
study  [14],  CHD  (Chinese  in  metropolitan  Denver,  CO, 
USA)  was  almost  the  same  as  CHB.  Although  the  dis-
tributions were more dispersed, ASW (African ancestry in 
southwest  USA)  and  MEX  (Mexican  ancestry  in  Los 
Angeles, CA, USA) were similar to CHB. The genotype data 
were  generated  using  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human 
SNP  array  5.0  [19];  however,  the  genotype  data  of  the 
HapMap project were generated using two platforms of the 
Illumina  Human  1M  and  the  Affymetrix  SNP  6.0  [38]. 
Because of the difference in the platforms used, the current 
study showed a smaller number of SNPs in the region (Fig.

2A). If the same platforms were used for genotyping, similar 
increases in the r2 estimates of chromosome 14 to JPT and 
CHB might be observed in Fig. 1 [14]. The region contains 
the complete gephyrin gene (GPHN). In Fig. 2B, a huge LD 
block  of  the  region  was  observed  using  Haploview  [39], 
similar to a previous study [14].

The  past  population  history  of  the  total  population  is 
shown in Fig. 1. Excluding the influence of current effective 
population size, the past population history of Koreans was 
similar to the CHB of the HapMap data. The results looked 
reasonable, considering the similarity of the modern histories 
between Korea and China, which include the resistance to 
Western civilizations and the short period of colonization. 
However, there is a huge difference between the current Ne 
of  Korean  populations  and  the  current  Ne  of  CHB.  The 
current Ne of CHB was 2,926 [14]. The Chinese government 
has  enforced  a  one-child  policy  since  1978;  however,  the 
Korean government encouraged a two-child policy without 
any forcible action [40]. These differences in policy might 
have resulted in significant differences in the current Ne sizes 
of the Korean and Chinese populations. The populations of 
both  the  urban  and  rural  areas  showed  similar  past 
population histories as that of the total population (Fig. 1).
Fig.  3  shows  the  estimates  of  the  current  and  recent 
effective population sizes of various age groups. Because the 
initial sample collection was conducted from 2001 to 2003, 
the year of birth for individuals aged 69 to 40 would be 1933 
to 1962, respectively, if the baseline year of collection were 
assumed to be 2002. Therefore, there could be inaccuracies 
of 1 or 2 years in assigning the year of birth. The recent Ne 
involves  recent  changes  in  the  effective  population  sizes, 
usually  within  a  few  generations.  Therefore,  the  recent 

effective  population  sizes  were  larger  than  the  current 
effective population sizes in Fig. 3, because the current Ne of 
individuals  born  in  a  certain  year  merely  represents  the 
effective population size of the population born in a certain 
year.  However,  the  recent  Ne  represents  the  effective 
population sizes of several previous generations. The current 
effective population sizes were mostly between 5,000 and 
30,000,  and  the  recent  effective  population  sizes  were 
usually higher than the current Ne and increased as the year 
of birth increased.

The current and recent Ne of samples with age 69 or older 
(born  in  1933)  was  9,457  and  20,165,  respectively.  For 
comparison, the maximum estimate of the current Ne of the 
HapMap data was 10,437. The current Ne of Koreans born in 
1933  was  already  large,  probably  because  of  the  high 
population density in Korea. The recent Ne, which is double 
the current Ne, indicates that the population growth of Korea 
lasted long before the colonial domination by Japan in 1910. 
There  were  two  age  groups  of  58  and  63,  for  which  the 
current  Ne  estimates  were  less  than  5,000.  The  corres-
ponding years are 1944 and 1939, respectively. World War II 
began in 1939 and ended in 1945, and comparatively fewer 
births would be expected during the period. However, there 
was a large increase of the current Ne in 1943, presenting a 
nettlesome question. There were several large increases of 
the current Ne in 1943, 1947, 1952, and 1958. The increases 
in 1947 and 1958 could be explained by the baby boom right 
after the wars; however, 1943 and 1952 were the 2 years and 
1 year, respectively, before the end of the wars, which lasted 
for 6 and 3 years, respectively. The current and recent Ne 
estimates  were  compared  to  the  number  of  the  total 
population and to the rates of population growth recorded in 

212

the  Korean  Statistical  Almanac  of  the  Korean  Statistical 
Information  Service  (http://kosis.kr).  The  rates  of  pop-
ulation growth fit with the increased current Ne in 1943 if the 
1-year  inaccuracies  in  assigning  the  year  of  birth  are 
considered. The increments of the current Ne in 1943 and 
1952 could be due to the decreased crude death rate and 
increased migration rates [37].

Discussion

Using  the  KARE  data,  the  current  and  recent  effective 
population sizes of Korea were estimated, based on HWE 
and LE deviations, and the past changes in population sizes 
were derived, based on the pattern of LD decay. The results 
showed clear exponential growth of the Korean population, 
similar to CHB of the HapMap data. The population growth 
of China has been positive continuously since 1400, except 
for the period from 1683 to 1700 [41]. The censuses in the 
Joseon  Dynasty  period  of  Korea  showed  low  rates  of 
population growth in the 1800s [37]. The large recent Ne of 
the  69-year-old  age  group  (born  in  1933)  indicates  that 
Korea  might  have  experienced  continuous  population 
growth at least in 1873, assuming a generation time of 20 
years for the 3 most recent generations. A simulation result 
of  rapid  growth  (Ne  changes:  1000,  2000,  4000,  10,000) 
showed half (5,212) the current Ne [13]; however, the recent 
Ne of the 69-year-old age group was double the current Ne. 
Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  the  population  growth  started 
much earlier than 1873 [13, 14]. In the metropolitan area, 
people from all over the country might have increased the Ne. 
The  migration  effects  and  the  discrepancy  between  the 
census and the results need more explanations.

The  age-dependent  Ne  estimates  showed  good  concor-
dance with the actual modern history of Korea, although 
several of them require more explanation. Because of the 
inaccuracies in assigning the year of birth, a sample of the 
58-year-old age group might be mixed with a sample of the 
age  groups  of  57  and  59.  Although  it  is  a  rare  occasion, 
individuals having genomic potential to increase current Ne 
in the 57 and 59 age groups might have been assigned to the 
58-year-old age group accidently during the sample collec-
tion. In any case, the population growth in war time needs 
more explanation. In Fig. 3, the trend of recent Ne followed 
the  trend  of  current  Ne  in  many  cases.  Especially,  the 
increased  current  Ne  in  1943  contributed  to  the  rapid 
increase in the recent Ne in the late 1950s as the individuals 
born in 1943 could contribute to reproduction. The recent Ne 
decreased  rapidly  in  the  42-year-old  age  group  (born  in 
1960), which needs explanation. The baby-boom individuals 
born in 1958 were 2 years old and could not contribute to 
giving birth. The recent Ne increased again in 1961 and 1962, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

possibly due to the contributions of individuals who were 
born  in  the  previous  baby-boom  period  and  reached 
reproductive age.

In the previous studies, it was not necessary to analyze a 
large  number  of  variants.  However,  the  current  study 
showed that the number of genotypes, as well as the number 
of  individuals,  might  be  important  for  the  quality  of  the 
results  to  infer  the  past  population  history.  In  Supple-
mentary Fig. 2, the estimates of many age groups were less 
consistent, even with larger numbers of samples than the 
sample sizes of the HapMap data. The smallest sample size 
for the former was 197, and the largest sample size for the 
latter was 143. However, the number of genotypes would not 
have had much influence much on the estimations of the 
current and recent Ne, as indicated in previous simulation 
studies [13]. Therefore, the possibility of lower genotype 
quality could not be excluded, either. It is also possible that 
inconsistent estimates were seen more in the CHB than in 
other populations, which showed the most rapid population 
growth.  Because  Korean  populations  showed  more  rapid 
population growth than CHB, the rapid growth might be the 
reason for the inconsistent estimates. With more genotypes, 
the increases in r2 estimates in chromosome 14 could also be 
seen clearly in Fig. 1, similar to CHB and JPT of the HapMap 
project.

The  recent  Ne  of  the  total  population  was  2,518,501, 
which was incredibly large. Considering that the current Ne 
of the total population was 100,778, the KARE data showed 
that the population is under serious deduction of effective 
population size. The ratio of the current to recent Ne was 
0.04. This small ratio might be due to migration and extreme 
population concentration to a metropolitan area. Migration 
might have had more influence on the recent Ne rather than 
the current Ne, because the recent Ne reflects the population 
that  moved  from  all  over  the  country.  In  addition,  the 
division of the Korean peninsula after the Korean War might 
have resulted in the extreme ratio. The population moved to 
the metropolitan area from all over the country, but they 
could  not  move  back  to  the  northern  part  of  the  Korean 
peninsula.  The  ratio  was  not  comparable  to  any  of  the 
HapMap data, in which 0.64 of JPT was the lowest, and all 
populations were concordant with their recent population 
changes. In Fig. 3, the tendency started in 1933 for the eldest 
ones in the data, and it became more severe as the age of the 
sampled individuals decreased. The total sample contains 
more relatively young individuals than elders; however, the 
ratio of 0.04 was too small. If the ratios were correct, as 
shown in the HapMap data, Fig. 3 shows that the significant 
reduction in effective population size began in 1953, right 
after  the  Korean  War,  probably  due  to  migration  and  the 
division of the Korean peninsula. As indicated previously

[13], the Ne estimates do not represent the actual population 
size exactly. Further studies for the effects of migrations and 
confinements  with  refined  samples  and  data  could  be 
helpful.

The estimates of the current effective population size were 
91,433 in the rural area and 76,097 in the urban area. The 
result  was  surprising,  because  the  urban  area  is  more 
populated than the rural area. The age distributions of each 
region differed significantly (Supplementary Fig. 3A). The 
sample of the urban area contains a smaller number of elders 
and a larger number of relatively young individuals; however, 
the  sample  of  the rural  area shows relatively even distri-
bution,  with  a  slightly  larger  number  of  elders  (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A). If the current effective population sizes, 
depending on age, were examined (Supplementary Fig. 3B), 
the current effective population sizes of the rural area were 
relatively even compared to the current effective population 
sizes of the urban area. Some of the estimates were negative, 
which  generally  indicate  large  Ne  values  and  sampling 
failures, considering the results of previous studies [13]. For 
the current Ne estimates of the urban area, the estimates 
were usually small, except for several estimates of relatively 
younger ages. The overall small uneven estimates and the 
uneven  age  distribution  of  the  urban  area  might  have 
resulted in the smaller current Ne estimate than the estimate 
of the rural area. The recent Ne of the rural area was 495,871, 
but the estimate of the recent Ne of the urban area was a 
negative value. As mentioned previously, the negative value 
might  have  come  from  a  large  Ne  and  sampling  failure. 
Therefore, the negative recent Ne estimate of the urban area 
probably  indicates  an  extremely  large  recent  Ne.  More 
studies are necessary to determine the effects of uneven age 
distributions, rapid population fluctuations, migrations, and 
population confinements on the Ne estimates.
