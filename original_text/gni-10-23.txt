Abstract

There  are  lots  of  studies  attempting  to  identify  the  ex-
pression  changes  in  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma.  Most 
studies  include  insufficient  samples  to  apply  statistical 
methods  for  detecting  significant  gene  sets.  This  study 
combined  two  small  microarray  datasets  from  a  public 
database  and  identified  significant  genes  associated 
with  the  progress  of  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma. 
There  were  different  expression  scales  between  the  two 
datasets,  even  though  these  datasets  were  generated 
under  the  same  platforms  -  Affymetrix  U133A  gene 
chips.  We  discretized  gene  expressions  of  the  two  data-
sets  by  adjusting  the  differences  between  the  datasets 
for  detecting  the  more  reliable  information.  From  the 
combination  of  the  two  datasets,  we  detected  51  signifi-
cant  genes  that  were  upregulated  in  oral  squamous  cell 
carcinoma.  Most  of  them  were  published  in  previous 
studies  as  cancer-related  genes.  From  these  selected 
genes,  significant  genetic  pathways  associated  with  ex-
pression  changes  were  identified.  By  combining  several 
datasets  from  the  public  database,  sufficient  samples 
can  be  obtained  for  detecting  reliable  information.  Most 
of  the  selected  genes  were  known  as  cancer-related 
genes,  including  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma.  Several 
unknown  genes  can  be  biologically  evaluated  in  further 
studies.

motherapeutic  treatment  protocols,  the  prognosis  of  oral 
squamous  cell  carcinoma  (OSCC)  remains  mournful,  with 
an  approximate  50%  5-year  mortality  rate  from  disease 
or  associated  complications  [1].  Therefore,  the  identi-
fication  of  biological  markers  is  essential  to  make  prog-
ress  in  detecting  malignancy  at  an  early  stage  and  de-
veloping  novel  therapies  [2].
    Microarray  datasets  that  are  created  for  the  same  re-
search  purposes  in  different  laboratories  have  accumu-
lated  rapidly.  The  results  from  different  datasets  are  of-
ten  inconsistent  due  to  the  utilization  of  different  plat-
forms,  sample  preparations,  or  various  technical  varia-
tions.  If  we  could  combine  such  datasets  by  adjusting 
for  systematic  biases  that  exist  among  different  datasets 
derived  from  different  experimental  conditions,  the  pow-
er  of  statistical  tests  would  be  improved  by  the  increase 
in  sample  size  [3]. 
    In  OSCC,  although  lots  of  microarray-based  studies 
have  been  conducted  to  provide  insights  into  gene  ex-
pression  changes,  most  of  these  studies  have  contained 
insufficient  samples  for  detecting  reliable  information  us-
ing  statistical  analysis  [4,  5].  Therefore,  this  study  at-
tempted  to  combine  several  datasets  in  the  public  data-
base  for  detecting  significant  genes.
    We  used  two  small  microarray  datasets  of  OSCC  for 
this  study,  which  were  based  on  the  same  platform  but 
had  different  expression  scales.  These  two  datasets 
were  combined  after  discretization,  because  a  previous 
study  showed  that  classification  could  be  improved  us-
ing  combined  datasets  after  discretization  [3].  After 
combining  datasets,  we  used  chi-square  test  for  identi-
fying  the  significant  genes.  Chi-square  test  has  been 
used  commonly  to  detect  differentially  expressed  genes 
after  discretization  of  expression  intensities  in  the  micro-
array  experiment.
    In  this  study,  gene  expression  ratios  of  two  datasets 
were  transformed  with  their  ranks  for  each  dataset. 
Next,  the  transformed  datasets  were  combined,  and  a 
nonparametric  statistical  method  was  applied  to  the 
combined  dataset  to  detect  informative  genes.  Finally, 
we  showed  that  most  of  the  selected  genes  were 
known  to  be  involved  in  various  cancers,  including 
OSCC.

Methods

Dataset

Two  microarray  datasets  were  used  for  this  study.  We 
acquired  these  datasets  from  a  public  database  (Gene 
Expression  Omnibus,  GEO).  One  was  the  expression  da-
taset  of  16  tumors  and  4  normal  tissues  from  16  pa-
tients,  using  Affymetrix  U133A  gene  chips  (Affymetrix, 
Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  The  other  microarray  dataset 
consisted  of  expression  profiles  of  22  tumors  and  5  nor-
mal  tissues.  These  two  datasets  were  experimented  on 
under  the  same  platform,  Affymetrix  U133A.  The  data-
sets  are  summarized  in  Table  1.

Process  for  combining  datasets

For  combining  datasets,  gene  expression  ratios  are  re-
arranged  in  order  of  expression  ratios  by  each  gene  in 
each  dataset,  and  the  ranks  are  matched  with  the  cor-
responding  experimental  group. 
If  the  experimental 
groups  are  homogenous,  the  ranks  within  the  same  ex-
perimental  group  would  be  neighboring.  The  process  of 
discretization  of  gene  expressions  is  summarized  in  the 
following  steps  [3]:

(1) Rank  the  gene  expression  ratios  within  a  gene  for 

each  dataset.

(2) List  in  order  of  the  ranks,  and  assign  the  order  of 
gene  expressions  to  the  corresponding  experimen-
tal  groups.

(3) Summarize  the  result  of  (2)  in  the  form  of  a  con-

tingency  table  for  each  gene.

(4) Combine  the  contingency  tables  that  have  been

    When  there  are  three  datasets  to  be  combined,  the 
datasets  can  be  added  as  a  single  entry,  as  shown  in 
Table  2,  after  the  transformation  of  each  dataset  by  rank.

Identification  of  significant  genes  from  a  com-
bined  dataset

After  the  summarization  of  gene  expression  ratios  in  the 
form  of  a  contingency  table  for  each  gene,  as  shown  in 
Table  3,  a  nonparametric  statistical  method  was  applied 
to  the  datasets  for  independence  testing  between  gene 
expression  patterns  and  experimental  groups.  The  test 
statistics  are  calculated  as  follows  for  each  gene:

    When  the  sample  size  is  small  -  generally Ê(nij)  less 

than  5  -  Fisher’s  exact  test  is  recommended  rather  than 
chi-square  test.

    The  significant  genes  can  be  selected  by  an  in-
dependence  test  between  the  phenotypes  and  gene  ex-
pressions  using  this  type  of  summarized  dataset. ci and 
ri represent  the  marginal  sums  of  the  ith column  and 
row,  respectively.  nij is  the  number  of  experiments  be-
longing  to  Ei  and  Pj,  and n  represents  the  total  number 
of  experiments.

tasets  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  Fig.  1.  Subgroup 
and  sex  were  similarly  distributed  in  the  two  datasets. 
The  distributions  of  other  factors  were  not  included.
    The  scale  of  expression  levels  in  the  two  datasets 
was  different;  the  expression  values  of  Data  2004 
ranged  from  0.01  to  740,  and  those  of  Data  2005  were 
from  0.1  to  19,773.  The  expression  patterns  of  the  two 
datasets  can  be  explored  in  Fig.  1.
    Lots  of  outliers  are  shown  in  Fig.  1A  in  the  two  data-
sets  containing  whole  gene  sets.  However,  in  subsets  of 
significant  genes,  the  expression  ranges  got  narrow,  and 
the  outliers  were  decreased  (Fig.  1B).  The  expressions 
of  tumor  tissues  in  Data  2004  were  upregulated  and 
varied  compared  with  normal  tissues.  If  there  was  no 
outlier  with  a  maximum  value  in  the  14th  tumor  tissue 
in  Data  2004,  the  expressions  of  the  two  different 
groups  would  be  clearly  distinguished.  Any  clear  differ-
ences  in  expression  were  not  shown  between  the  two 
groups  in  Data  2005.

Upregulated 51  genes  in oral  squamous cell car-
cinoma

To  identify  differently  expressed  genes  between  normal 
and  tumor  tissues,  we  performed  chi-square  test  using 
a  combined  microarray  dataset.  Fifty-one  significant 
genes  were  selected  from  a  combined  dataset  with 
p-value  less  than  0.005,  which  were  upregulated  in 
OSCC  tissues.  The  significance  level  can  be  controlled, 
and  more  genes  can  be  selected  with  a  lower  sig-
nificance  level.  These  selected  genes  are  summarized  in 
Table  5.

    Many  genes  among  the  selected  genes  were  known 
as  cancer-related  genes.  STAT1  [6],  SKP2  [7],  IFI16  [8], 
RHEB  [9],  FIF44  [10],  SOD2  [11,  12],  and  GREM1  [11] 
are  related  to  OSCC.  Table  6  [13-56]  summarizes  the 

previous  studies  that  have  published  the  relations  of  se-
lected  genes  with  cancer.

way  maps  and  connections  and  specific  gene-gene  in-
teractions  were  inferred,  functionally  analyzed,  and  used 
to  build  on  the  existing  pathway  using  the  Ingenuity 
Pathway  Analysis  (IPA)  knowledge  base  [57]. 
    To  generate  networks  in  this  work,  the  knowledge 
base  was  queried  for  interactions  between  the  identified 
genes  and  all  other  genes  stored  in  the  database.  Four 
networks  were  found  to  be  significant  in  OSCC.  The 
network  with  the  highest  score  (Network  1,  score  =  36) 
was  generated,  with  17  identified  genes  (Table  7,  Fig. 
3).
    In  the  network  diagram,  STAT1  and  SOD2  neighbored 
with  NMI  and  AURKA,  respectively.  The  expression  lev-
els  of  STAT1  and  SOD2  could  be  expected  to  be  re-
lated  with  those  of  NMI  and  SOD2.  Actually,  the  ex-
pressions  of  STAT1  and  SOD2  were  strongly  positively 
correlated  with  NMI  (r  =  0.95)  and  AURKA  (r  =  0.87), 
respectively.

Discussion

in 

OSCC  is  associated  with  substantial  mortality  and  mor-
bidity  [58].  To  identify  potential  biomarkers  for  early  de-
tection  of  invasive  OSCC,  microarray  experiments  have 
been  conducted,  and  these  kinds  of  microarray  datasets 
have  accumulated  rapidly 
the  public  database. 
However,  there  are  many  datasets  that  include  in-
sufficient  sample  sizes  for  detecting  significant  genes  by 
statistical  analysis.  Therefore,  this  study  attempted  to 
combine  several  microarray  datasets  from  a  public  data-
base  to  identify  significant  candidates  as  biomarkers.
    In  a  microarray  data  analysis,  the  information  from 
different  datasets  obtained  under  different  experimental 
conditions  may  be  inconsistent  even  though  they  are 
performed  with  the  same  research  objectives.  Moreover, 
even  when  the  datasets  are  generated  by  the  same

These  genes  were  upregulated  in  oral  squamous  cell  carci-
noma  tissues,  and  normal  and  tumor  groups  were  clearly 
classified  with  these  genes. 

Expression  pattern  of  the  identified  genes

To  investigate  whether  the  different  experimental  groups 
could  be  classified  with  significant  genes,  an  unsuper-
vised  hierarchical  clustering  method  was  applied  to  the 
significant  gene  set  (Fig.  2). 
    The  normal  group  consisted  of  4  tissues  and  showed 
significantly  lower  expression  levels  when  compared 
with  the  tumor  group.  In  Fig.  2,  we  investigated  the 
classification  availability  of  the  identified  genes  in  Data 
2004,  not  in  a  combined  dataset,  because  the  two  data-
sets  have  different  expression  scales.

OSCC,  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma.
aGenes  in  bold  were  identified  in  this  study;  other  genes  were  neither  on  the  expression  array  data  used  in  this  work  nor  changed  sig-
nificantly;  bA  score  ＞ 3  was  considered  significant.

detecting  the  more  reliable  information.  Combining  data-
sets  is  especially  useful  in  OSCC  microarray  datasets, 
because  there  are  many  datasets  with  insufficient  sam-
ple  sizes  for  analysis  [4,  5,  59,  60].
    For  identifying  significant  genes  classifying  tumor  and 
normal  groups,  we  achieved  two  microarray  datasets 
from  a  public  database,  GEO.  They  included  20  and  27 
samples,  and  each  sample  size  was  unbalanced  be-
tween  the  different  groups.  By  combining  these  two  da-
tasets,  the  sample  size  was  increased,  and  we  had  a 
sufficient  sample  size 
for  statistical  analysis,  even 
though  it  was  still  unbalanced.  When  these  datasets 
were  combined,  we  used  the  rank  of  gene  expression, 
because  the  scale  of  gene  expression  was  different.  In 
this  study,  we  identified  51  significant  genes  from  a 
combined  dataset,  and  this  number  could  be  increased 
or  decreased  by  the  significance  level  (we  used  0.005). 
The  selected  51  genes  were  upregulated  in  tumor 
tissues.  Many  of  the  selected  genes  were  proven  to  be 
cancer-related  genes  by  previous  studies.
    SOD2  is  associated  with  lymph  node  metastasis  in 
OSCC  and  may  provide  predictive  values  for  the  diag-
nosis  of  metastasis  [10].  Metastasis  is  a  critical  event  in 
OSCC  progression.  An  SOD2  variant  has  also  been  as-
sociated  with  increased  breast  cancer  and  ovarian  can-
cer  risk  in  previous  studies  [47,  61].  TopBP1  included 
eight  BRCT  domains  (originally  identified  in  BRCA1),  and 
it  was  proposed  as  a  breast  cancer  susceptibility  gene 
[18,  62]. 
    By  semiquantitative  reverse  transcription  PCR  analy-
sis,  RHEB  was  shown  to  be  upregulated  in  OSCC  [9]. 
In  salivary  cancer,  survival  probability  rates  dropped

platform,  the  data  agreement  may  be  affected  by  tech-
nical  variations  between  laboratories.  In  such  cases,  it 
could  be  necessary  to  use  a  combined  dataset  after  ad-
justing  for  the  differences  between  such  datasets  for

when  Skp2  was  overexpressed  [7].  Overexpression  of 
Skp2  is  associated  with  the  reduction  of  p27  (KIP1)  ex-
pression  and  may  have  a  role  in  the  progression  of 
OSCC  [25].
    The  expression  of  RCN2  was  linearly  related  to  the 
tumor  mass  increase,  and  its  expression  was  increased 
in  breast  cancer  [16].  PTPRK  was  proven  as  a  candi-
date  gene  of  colorectal  cancer  [19],  and  it  is  a  func-
tional  tumor  suppressor  in  Hodgkin  lymphoma  cells  [20]. 
DMTF1  was  shown  to  be  amplified  in  adenocarcinoma 
of  the  gastroesophageal  junction,  residing  at  7q21  by 
aCGH  experiments  [21].  FEZ1  was  involved  in  ovarian 
carcinogenesis,  and  its  reduction  or  loss  could  be  an 
aid  to  the  clinical  management  of  patients  affected  by 
ovarian  carcinoma  [22].  It  is  also  a  known  tumor  sup-
pressor  gene  in  breast  cancer  and  gastric  cancer  [23, 
63]. 
    Other  ovarian  cancer-related  genes  were  NMI  [27,  28] 
and FANCI [44]; breast cancer-related genes were COX11 
[42],  MELK  [33],  and  FANCI  [44]  among  the  selected 
genes.  MELK  was  known  to  be  associated  with  shorter 
survival  in  glioblastoma  [34].
    TTK  was  associated  with  progression  and  metastasis 
of  advanced  cervical  cancers  after  radiotherapy  [29,  30]. 
It  might  also  be  a  relevant  candidate  as  a  new  target 
in  cancer  therapy,  since  it  plays  relevant  roles  in  mitotic 
progression  and  the  spindle  checkpoint  [31,  32].  Aurora 
kinase  A  (AURKA)  was  associated  with  skin  tumors  [36] 
and  colorectal  cancer  [37,  38].
    In  previous  studies,  OSCC-related  genes  among  the 
selected  genes  were  STAT1  [14],  SKP2  [7,  25],  IFI16  [8], 
RHEB  [9],  IFI44  [64],  SOD2  [10-12],  and  GREM1  [11]. 
The  gene  set,  which  has  not  been  proven  as  OSCC-re-
lated  genes  until  now,  could  be  expected  to  be  possibly 
proven  as  OSCC-related  genes  by  biological  evaluation.
    In  this  study,  we  identified  significant  genes  related 
with  OSCC  from  two  microarray  datasets  in  a  public 
database.  For  this,  we  transformed  microarray  datasets 
using  ranks  of  gene  expressions  with  different  expres-
sion  scales,  even  though  they  were  constructed  under 
the  same  experimental  conditions.  This  method  could  be 
useful  when  using  multiple  datasets  that  are  created  for 
the  same  research  purpose,  By  combining  these  accu-
mulated  datasets,  we  can  detect  more  reliable  infor-
mation  due  to  the  increased  sample  size.  It  saves  time 
and  money  and  avoids  repeating  experiments.
