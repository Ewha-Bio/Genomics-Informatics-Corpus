Foldback intercoil (FBI) DNA is formed by the folding back at one point of a non-helical parallel track of double-stranded DNA 
at as sharp as 180° and the intertwining of two double helixes within each other’s major groove to form an intercoil with a 
diameter of 2.2 nm. FBI DNA has been suggested to mediate intra-molecular homologous recombination of a deletion and 
inversion. Inter-molecular homologous recombination, known as site-specific insertion, on the other hand, is mediated by 
the direct perpendicular approach of the FBI DNA tip, as the attP site, onto the target DNA, as the attB site. Transposition of 
DNA  transposons  involves  the  pairing  of  terminal  inverted  repeats  and  5–7-bp  tandem  target  duplication.  FBI  DNA 
configuration effectively explains simple as well as replicative transposition, along with the involvement of an enhancer 
element.  The  majority  of  diverse  retrotransposable  elements  that  employ  a  target  site  duplication  mechanism  is  also 
suggested  to  follow  the  FBI  DNA-mediated  perpendicular  insertion  of  the  paired  intercoil  ends  by  non-homologous 
end-joining, together with gap filling. A genome-wide perspective of transposable elements in light of FBI DNA is discussed.

Introduction

The  transposable  element  (TE)  was  first  described  by 
McClintock [1] as a controlling element that jumps from one 
position to another in the maize chromosome in the mid- 
1940s, long before the discovery by Watson and Crick of the 
double helix structure of DNA as a genetic element [2]. It 
was a time when, after the rediscovery of Mendel’s Law of 
Heredity in 1900, the cytogenetic study of chromosomes was 
at the forefront of genetics and when genes were thought to 
be beads on a string located on the chromosome. It was in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s when insertion sequence (IS) 
elements and transposons (Tn) were discovered and found 
to be similar to McClintock’s controlling elements, and her 
AC/DS elements were confirmed at the DNA sequence level 
as a TE [3]. Salient features of DNA transposable elements 
(dTEs), including terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), target 
site duplication (TSD), the transposase gene, and simple and 
replicative transposition mechanisms have been well esta-
blished  by  extensive  molecular  biology  and  biochemistry 

studies [4]. Then, retrotransposable elements (rTEs), inclu-
ding  long  terminal  repeat  (LTR)-retrotransposons,  non- 
LTR-retrotransposons, and other retro-elements, were being 
added to the repertoire since the 1980s to make the picture 
diverse and complicated [5]. Many new families of TEs are 
being  added,  especially  from  eukaryotes,  even  by  com-
putational  screening  in  the  post-genome  era,  which  has 
necessitated a new classification based on their structures 
and mechanisms of transposition [6].

The presence of foldback intercoil (FBI) DNA was first 
reported by Kim in 1985 [7] and shown by a space filling 
model  to  mediate  intra-molecular  homologous  recombi-
nation of inversions and deletions. It was further shown in 
1987  that  FBI  DNA  can  mediate  inter-molecular  DNA 
rearrangements,  such  as  site-specific  insertions,  at  the 
foldback  tip  and  DNA  transpositional  integration  at  the 
intercoil end of the detached dTE [8]. It will be examined in 
this review how FBI DNA mediation of transposition can be 
extended to different classes and families of rTEs. Readers 
are suggested to refer to many good reviews available on the

the gene products and on the mechanisms of transposition 
with  excellent  diagrammatic  illustrations  [5,  9-12].  This 
review will minimize duplicate descriptions and focus on the 
mechanistic features that are relevant to the application of 
FBI DNA to the mechanisms of DNA transposition.

Structures of TEs and Mechanisms of Trans-
position

To build the basis for comparison and understand tran-
sposition  mechanisms,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  TE 
structures based on the presence or absence of the following 
factors: 1) RNA intermediates before transposition, 2) TIRs 
or LTRs, 3) transposase or reverse transcriptase (RT) and 
other proteins related to autonomous or non-autonomous 
transposition,  4)  TSD,  and  5)  other  features,  like  DNA 
replication modes, hairpin structure, and enhancers. 

Transposition of dTEs involves direct movement of the 
dTE intermediate either by a simple cut-and-paste mecha-
nism,  as  in  Tn5  [13],  Tn7  [14],  and  Tn10  [15],  or  by 
replicative transposition, in which case one copy stays in the 
original site and a daughter dTE copy appears in a distant 
location [16-18]. Step-wise description of the transposition 
events includes the requirement and pairing of both dTE 
ends [13, 19], binding of the transposase proteins to the 
terminal sequences, double-strand breaks (DSBs) of the dTE 
terminals [14] and target ends, ligation of the 3'-OH donor 
end and the 5'-P target end, and gap repair of the single- 
strand gaps on the target that were generated by DSB [20]. In 
the case of the Mu bacteriophage, the gap can be repaired 
while the entire transposon gets replicated in a cointegrate 
mechanism [21, 22]. 

Transposition of rTEs involves an RNA intermediate that 
is  reverse-transcribed  by  RT  into  a  cDNA.  This  double- 
stranded linear DNA functions as the direct precursor for 
integration by an integrase protein into a new location in the 
host chromosome in a ‘copy and paste’ manner, as in the 
‘cut-and-paste’ transposition reaction in dTEs [20, 23]. 

TIRs are a hallmark of dTEs, as LTRs have been that of 
rTEs until they were joined by non-LTR retrotransposons, 
which have a 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR) and 3' UTR, as 
typified by LINE-1 (L1), or which has neither of the terminal 
elements, as typified by the Alu element. It becomes clear 
that the presence of terminal repeats in the TEs is no longer 
a common requirement for the transposition reaction.

The description of the protein factors above will suffice for 
this review, except for the long interspersed nuclear element 
(LINE) open reading frames (ORFs). The retrotransposition 
and  integration  of  LINE  have  been  viewed  as  a  coupled 
process, called target- primed reverse-transcription [5, 24]. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

However,  this  model  has  recently  been  enhanced  by  the 
finding that L1 reverse- transcription does not require base 
pairing between the primer and template [25]. Both the RT 
and endonuclease domains in L1 are encoded by the same 
ORF.  Therefore,  the  cDNA  that  was  reverse-transcribed 
from the mRNA expressed from the genomic copy of LINE is 
inserted into the host genome [9]. 

TSDs are generated in almost all classes and families of 
TEs, except for the Helitron dTE superfamily [6, 9, 10]. The 
size of the TSD varies from 2 to 11, but the sequences are not 
conserved. The size is unique to superfamilies and can be 
used  as  a  diagnostic  feature.  The  ubiquitous  presence  of 
TSDs, which are generated by gap fillings (GFs) after TE 
integration  on  the  target  [26],  reflects  the  unity  in  tran-
sposition  reactions,  regardless  of  dTE  or  rTE,  and  the 
presence or absence of terminal repeats [22]. Yet, the mea-
ning of the small oligomer size of the duplicated target is 
seldom discussed in terms of DNA structure. This aspect 
will be dealt with below with the FBI DNA mechanism.

Helitron, a eukaryotic dTE, is considered, together with 
Polintons, a third class of TEs for many unique aspects [9]. 
Helitron  does  not  have  TIRs  but  has  5'-TC  and  CCTR-3' 
termini instead. They contain 16–20-bp hairpins 10–12 nu-
cleotides  inside  of  the  3'-end  and  transpose  precisely 
between  the  5'-A  and  T-3'  with  no  TSD  generation.  It  is 
known to adopt replicative rolling circle transposition [27]. 
Helitrons  indiscriminately  capture  and  mobilize  gene  se-
quences and may impact hybrid vigor or heterosis in maize 
[28]. The hairpin is presumed to serve as the terminator of 
rolling  circle  replication  [9].  Since  the  hairpin  sequence 
corresponds to the FBI DNA motif, it will be interesting to 
consider whether it can not only serve as a terminator or 
rolling circle replication but also serve as a replication origin 
for  its  own  replication  and  for  frequent  gene  capture 
activities, which the Helitron is capable of.
Polinton  was  discovered  and  characterized  based  on 
bioinformatics studies [27]. Polinton is 15–20 kb long, with 
a 6-bp TSD and 100–1,000-bp TIR at both ends. Polintons 
code  up  to  10  proteins,  including  a  family  of  B  DNA 
polymerases (POLBs), a retroviral-like integrase, an A tran-
sposase, and an adenoviral-like cysteine protease. Polintons, 
however, with their structural characteristics and presence 
of TSD, should follow non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) 
with  the  GF  transposition  mechanism,  as  ordinary  dTEs. 
What makes it unique is the presence of a self-encoded POLB 
and a short 1–3-bp terminal tandem repeat that supports a 
protein-primed self-synthesis mechanism for Polinton pro-
pagation.  This  mechanism  calls  for  an  extrachromosomal 
single-stranded Polinton intermediate that forms a racket- 
like  structure  and  follows  POLB-mediated  replication  to 
become  double-stranded  before  being  integrated  into  the

host genome [9]. 

It has been proposed that eukaryotic dTEs follow three 
types  of  transposition  mechanisms  according  to  different 
replication  modes:  cut-and-paste  for  most  dTEs,  rolling 
circle replication for Helitrons, and synthetic replication for 
Polintons [9]. In fact, there seems to be many different cases 
of transposon-related replication that need to be clarified in 
the future. As mentioned earlier, continuation of DNA repli-
cation of an inserted TE molecule, like in Mu co-integration, 
may also fill the gap to generate TSDs. It should be em-
phasized that DNA transposition has been grouped in two: 
simple,  conservative,  or  ‘cut-and-paste’  mechanism  and 
replicative transposition [16, 17, 29]. In Tn5, at the outer 
ends, ori-C-like 9-bp sequences are found, which may serve 
to direct host replication functions to the ends of the element 
during transposition [17]. Transposition of Tn5 may involve 
replication  proceeding  from  both  ends  in  a  symmetrical 
manner. This type of mechanism may differ from the pola-
rized replication of other elements [17]. A synthetic mecha-
nism  is  proposed  for  Polinton  propagation  to  explain 
protein-primed  replication  of  a  racket-like  structure  of  a 
single-stranded Polinton [9]. If it gets to be understood that 
the heteroduplex structure that is derived from FBI DNA 
may serve as the template of DNA replication, many of the 
diverse  cases  of  DNA  replication  may  be  clarified  (see 
below). 

FBI DNA

FBI DNA is formed by the folding back at one point of a 
non-helical  parallel  track  of  double-stranded  DNA  at  as 
sharp as 180° and the intertwining of the bent helixes within 
each  other’s  major  groove  to  form  an  intercoil  with  a 
diameter of 2.2 nm (Fig. 1A). FBI DNA could be considered 
a  double-stranded  version  of  a  hairpin  or  stem-and-loop 
structure of RNA and single-stranded DNA. But, such sharp 

bending and formation of a four-stranded intercoil are not 
considered  possible  with  a  double  helical  B-DNA  with  a 
diameter of 2.0 nm [8]. In an extended definition, FBI DNA 
may contain a loop and a much longer stem under biological 
conditions. Intercoil DNA is designated to distinguish itself 
from supercoil DNA, which is thicker than 2.2 nm. Intercoil 
DNA is also termed to avoid the use of four-stranded DNA, 
which  has  the  connotation  of  four-stranded  base  pairing 
among homologous repeats. It needs to be emphasized that 
intercoil DNA is formed by two intertwining duplexes of any 
sequence, but when homology is met at a certain region, 
homologous recombination may proceed via heteroduplex 
formation with the help of the proper enzymes involved. 

FBI  DNA  was  first  formulated  based  upon  a  rare  but 
unique  electron  microscopy  (EM)  configuration  of  plant 
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules and space-filling 
models [7, 8]. Once the FBI DNA structure was realized with 
the space filling model, it was possible to perform homo-
logous  recombination  with  direct  contact  of  the  repeat 
sequences. The intra-molecular homologous recombination 
of  a  deletion  and  inversion  occurs  via  1)  synapsis  of  the 
repeats in the intercoil, 2) heteroduplex formation by 90° 
base flipping, and 3) nick-and-close resolution of the sugar 
phosphate  backbone  crossing  over  [7].  Inter-molecular 
homologous  recombination,  known  as  site-specific  inser-
tion,  on  the  other  hand,  is  mediated  by  direct  contact 
between the attP site at the tip of the FBI DNA and the attB 
site on the target DNA [8]. Perpendicular approach of the 
foldback  tip  onto  the  target  site  effectively  resolves  the 
year-long topological puzzle encountered in four-stranded 
base  pair  winding  of  two  circular  DNA  molecules  and 
explains that 6- or 7-bp attP and attB sites correspond to the 
diameter  of  the  approaching  FBI  DNA  tip  and  the  target 
width.  DNA  transposition  is  explainable  by  the  perpen-
dicular approach of the detached transposon ends in intercoil 
form to the host target, as described in detail below.

DNA Transposition Explained by FBI DNA

Transposition of a dTE molecule in FBI DNA configura-
tion is tested by a space filling model, as presented in Fig. 1 
and as a detailed diagram in Fig. 2 [30]. The TE molecule, 
detached  from  the  host  by  a  DSB  in  a  blunt  end  cut, 
approaches,  as  shown  in  the  diagram,  at  a  perpendicular 
angle to the target site. Both 3'-OH ends of the TE ligate with 
the 5'-P ends of the staggered-cut target, leaving the over-
hang target ends single-stranded, which would be repaired 
by gap filling. As shown in the diagram (Fig. 2), when the TE 
ends approach the target on the minor groove side, the target 
size would be 5 bp on the minor groove side and 7 bp on the 
major groove side. This explains the meaning of the average 
size  of  the  5–7-bp  target  duplication,  as  it  matches  the 
diameter of the incoming intercoil DNA, 2.2 nm. In reality, 
the target sizes vary between 2 to even over 10 bp in a TE 
superfamily-specific manner. This TSD size variation could 
be explained by several factors—namely, local squeeze and 
stretch of the DNA double helix; unequal cutting positions 
of the TE ends, as exemplified in Tn7 by the 3-nt overhang by 
staggered DSB [14]; the characteristics of the endonucleases 
involved; and even temporary loosening of the intercoil end 
during a very elaborate and concerted coordination of the 
transpososome structure [8]. 

In  earlier  days,  when  IS  and  Tn,  and  even  the  LTR 
retrotransposons, were the major players of transposition, it 
was the presence of terminal repeats that attracted attention 
for explaining the transpositional mechanism, as in homo-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

logous recombination. Therefore, it was somewhat puzzling 
to explain the cases of non-LTR retrotransposons with asym-
metric termini sequences. But, it is now TSD that attracts 
attention as a common factor for the transposition mecha-
nism  of  all  TEs,  except  for  Helitrons.  It  is  the  structural 
nature  of  the  intercoil,  which  is  formed  by  intertwining 
duplexes,  regardless  of  the  homology  between  the  two 
termini. When both ends of a TE synapse in the form of an 
intercoil, are cut by a DSB off the host duplex strand, and 
approach the target in perpendicular direction, their 3'-OH 
ends ligate to the staggered 5'-P ends of the broken target. 
The  resulting  overhang  single-strand  DNA  gaps  on  both 
flanking  ends  of  the  target  are  repaired  to  generate  the 
accompanying TSD. The significance of the terminal repeats 
is then the homologous recombination that is required for 
further  transactions  of  recombination,  replication,  and 
transcription.

FBI  DNA  and  Enhancer  Concept  for  DNA 
Transposition

The enhancer is a cis element of DNA that affects, as a 
third factor, DNA transactions, such as transcription, homo-
logous  recombination,  and  transposition  [31-34].  It  has 
remained somewhat of an enigma, because the presence of 
an enhancer element and its binding proteins at a distance in 
a sequence and orientation non-specific manner enhances 
the efficiency of the reaction by 1,000 times. 

Rather unique configurations of rigid rod-like DNA with a 
big protein complex at one end [35, 36 Fig. 4-2] may shed

light on the enhancer concept and give us an idea of what 
actually happens under cellular conditions (Fig. 3). Folding 
back of a  DNA duplex  at a  distant point  would bring  an 
enhancer site into juxtaposition with the base of a TE, which 
has also branched out as FBI DNA (Figs. 4 and 5). Proteins 
binding to the enhancer site and to both ends of the TE and 
any  other  additional  factors  together  would  form  a  tight 
DNA-protein complex, called a transpososome. This trans-
pososome would provide a tight and stable surgical platform 
for  a  series  of  highly  concerted  precision  cut-and-  paste 
reactions: namely, DSB of the TE termini, sealing of the host 
duplexes by NHEJ, staggered cuts on the target site, NHEJ of 
the  TE  3'-OH  ends  and  target  5'-P  ends,  and  finally, 
gap-filling of the 5–7-nucleotide single-strand portions to 
flank the transposed TE. 

In replicative transposition (Fig. 5), there are two possi-
bilities [21]. First, the gap-filling reaction during TSD may 
continue on to the TE molecule by displacement or polarized 
replication, even though the direction of replication may be 
reversible [20]. Second, as shown in the diagram, TIRs in the 
FBI DNA configuration may transform into heteroduplexes 
and  serve  as  primers  for  bidirectional  replication  of  the 
internal TE, thus keeping one copy at the original site and 
depositing the other copy to the target site in juxtaposition. 
Inversion of the replicated TE may result from homologous 
recombination, as predicted [7, 16]. 

Conclusions and Perspectives

TSD  serves  as  a  common  landmark  of  unity  on  tran-
sposition  mechanisms  for  both  dTEs  and  rTEs.  The  only 
exception so far is the Helitron superfamily, which lacks TSD 
and employs a rolling circle replication model. As long as a 
TSD is generated during TE integration into the host chro-
mosome,  it  indicates  that  the  immediate  intermediate  of 
integration is in a double-stranded DNA form, regardless of 
RNA or single-stranded DNA being the initial intermediate. 
From the EM pictures of FBI and rigid rod configurations 
of native DNA (Fig. 3), an ideal configuration of a transposo-
some may be envisioned. It becomes apparent that vertical 
insertion of the DSB ends of the TE in an intercoil alignment 
is  probably  the  best-fitting  mechanism  of  DNA  transpo-
sition. Small sizes of the target, around 6–7 bp, encountered 
in TSD as well as in attP and attB in site-specific insertion all 
point to the fact that they correspond to the diameter of FBI 
DNA 2.2 nm. 

The transpososome, made of FBI DNA configurations of 
the TE and the enhancer element, may effectively abolish 
lingering  mechanistic  puzzles  about  keeping  four  broken 
strands of the TE and the host from flying apart and answer 
how a TE molecule jumps onto a new target site at a distance. 
Replicative transposition is explained likewise, even utili-
zing  the  terminal  homology  as  a  possible  origin  of  repli-
cation. It would be, however, difficult, if not impossible, to 

84

reproduce  such  a  transpososome  complex  in  vitro  by  FBI 
DNA configuration, which is critically needed for EM obser-
vations and crystallography analysis. 

There are four main modes of transactions by which the 
FBI DNA motif may be utilized in DNA functions in the cell: 
alpha deletion, omega inversion, needle point site-specific 
insertion, and NHEJ-GF integration of TE [8]. With such an 
abundant presence in strategically important positions in the 
genome and very dynamic functional roles, it is hoped that 
FBI DNA receives the proper recognition and interpretation 
for a better understanding of the life process.
