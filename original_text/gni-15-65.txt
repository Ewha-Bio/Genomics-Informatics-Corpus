Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic autoinflammatory disease that affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. Regarding its 
etiology,  although  HLA-B27  is  known  to  be  the  strongest  genetic  factor  of  AS,  much  evidence  suggests  the  potential 
contribution of non-MHC genes to the susceptibility to AS. Most of these non-MHC genes have been discovered in non-Asian 
populations; however, just some of them have been validated in Koreans. In this study, we aimed to identify additional 
AS-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) candidates by replicating the candidate SNPs in Korean AS patients and 
healthy controls. For this, we selected three SNPs (rs11249215 in RUNX3, rs6556416 in IL12B, and rs8070463 in TBKBP1), 
which were previously reported as risk factors of AS but have not been studied in Koreans, and performed genotyping assays 
using a total of 1138 Korean samples (572 AS patients and 566 healthy controls). Of the three SNP candidates, one SNP in 
RUNX3 (rs11249215) was significantly associated with the risk of AS (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.68, 
p = 0.03). These results will be helpful in elucidating the pathogenesis of AS and may be useful for developing AS risk 
prediction models in Koreans.

Introduction

Ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  is  a  type  of  chronic  auto-
inflammatory disease that affects the spine and sacroiliac 
joints. The pathogenesis of AS is not clear; however, it is 
believed to involve a combination of genetic and environ-
mental factors. Among them, human leukocyte antigen B27 
(HLA-B27) is the strongest genetic factor of AS. More than 
80% to 90% of patients with AS express HLA-B27, and the 
association between HLA-B27 and AS has been identified in 
many ethnic groups [1]. However, only a small portion of 
HLA-B27–positive individuals (＜5%) develop AS, sugge-
sting  a  potential  contribution  of  non-MHC  genes  to  the 
susceptibility to AS [2].

A number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 
of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have identified 
non-MHC genes associated with AS, such as IL-12B, ERAP1, 

RUNX3,  IL1R2,  and  ANTXR2  [3-6].  In  addition  to  SNPs, 
through genomewide copy number variant (CNV) analysis, 
CNVs  associated  with  AS  have  also  been  identified  [7]. 
These  AS-associated  non-MHC  genes  support  the  contri-
bution of non-MHC genes to the susceptibility to AS. They 
can also be valuable markers of the development of AS. 

From a clinical point of view, the identification of early AS 
before the appearance of radiological changes in the patient’s 
spine or sacroiliac joint is important, because current treat-
ment options, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 
inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, after 
these  changes  have  occurred  cannot  block  or  slow  down 
disease progression [8]. Instead, many reports suggest that 
earlier  treatment  of  TNF-α inhibitors  may  prevent  the 
progression of AS more effectively [8-10]. 

In  our  previous  work,  to  identify  AS-associated  SNP 
candidates in Koreans, we selected seven AS-associated SNP 
candidates, which had been identified in Caucasians by a

GWAS  and  consistently  replicated  in  East  Asians,  and 
performed a replication study with 285 Korean AS cases and 
363  healthy  controls  [11].  However,  in  contrast  to  our 
expectation, only one of them was replicated in Koreans. In 
this study, to identify other AS-associated SNP candidates, 
we selected three SNPs in non-MHC genes from previous 
GWASs [4, 5, 12, 13] that are associated with AS but have 
not  been  tested  in  Koreans—rs11249215  in  RUNX3, 
rs6556416  in  IL12B,  and  rs8070463  in  TBKBP1—and 
examined them in a large cohort of Koreans with AS and 
healthy controls.

Statistical analysis

The  differences  in  allele  and  genotype  frequencies 
between cases and controls were assessed using chi-squared 
test and Fisher exact test. Three genetic models (dominant, 
recessive, and allele) were used to test the SNP associations. 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium had been tested for all three 
SNPs, and their genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium in our cohort. Statistical analyses were performed 
using PLINK [15], and p-values less than 0.05 were con-
sidered to be significant in all statistical analyses. 

Methods 
Study subjects

A  total  of  1,138  individuals  (572  AS  patients  and  566 
healthy controls) were enrolled in this study. All of them 
were from our previous CNV discovery study [11, 13]. All AS 
cases were diagnosed according to the Modified New York 
Criteria [14]. This study was performed with the approval of 
the Institutional Review Board of the College of Medicine, 
Catholic University of Korea (CUMC10U170). The patients 
were  aged  26.7  ±  11.8  years  (85.3%  male  and  14.7% 
female), and 97.9% of them were HLA-B27–positive. The 
controls were aged 23.9 ± 11.8 years (94.7% male and 5.3% 
female), and 2.6% of them were HLA-B27–positive.
SNP genotyping

In this study, we selected three SNPs in non-MHC genes 
from previous GWASs [4, 5, 12, 13] that are associated with 
AS  but  have  not  been  tested  in  Koreans:  rs11249215  in 
RUNX3,  rs6556416  in  IL12B,  and  rs8070463  in  TBKBP1. 
SNP genotyping was performed using the ViiA7 system (Life 
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manu-
facturer’s  instructions.  The  thermal  cycling  program 
included one cycle at 95oC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles 
at 95oC for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, and a final extension at 
60oC  for  30  s.  Genotypes  were  determined  using  ViiA7 
software, version 1.2 (Life Technologies). 

Results

To evaluate the candidate AS-associated genetic markers, 
we selected three SNPs for a replication study in Koreans 
(rs11249215,  rs6556416,  and  rs8070463)  that  have  been 
previously reported as risk factors of AS but have not been 
studied in Koreans. All of them were located in non-exonic 
regions: rs11249215 was located in the promoter of RUNX3, 
rs6556416 was located in the 5'-flanking region of IL-12B, 
and  rs8070463  was  located  in  the  promoter  of  TBKBP1. 
General information on the three SNPs is summarized in 
Table 1.

We performed genotyping assays for the three SNPs using 
a total of 1,138 Koreans (572 AS patients and 566 healthy 
controls). Minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of the three SNPs 
in this study (0.57 for rs11249215, 0.91 for rs6556416, and 
0.44 for rs8070463) were largely similar to those in East 
Asians from the 1000 Genomes Project, suggesting that our 
genotyping assays were reliable (Table 1). In the association 
analysis, one SNP in RUNX3 (rs11249215) was significantly 
associated with the risk of AS in the recessive model (Table 
2). The MAF of rs11249215 was significantly higher in AS 
patients (MAF = 0.59) than in controls (MAF = 0.56) (odds 
ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.68; p = 0.03). 
However,  significance  was  not  detected  in  the  allelic  or 
dominant model for  rs11249215. The  other two SNPs  in 
IL-12B and TBKBP1 showed increased odds ratios, but they

Discussion

HLA-B27 is the strongest and most well-known genetic 
factor  of  AS.  However,  AS  develops  in  less  than  5%  of 
HLA-B27–positive individuals, suggesting the existence of 
additional  genetic  factors.  Indeed,  a  number  of  genetic 
markers  in  non-MHC  genes  have  been  identified  by  SNP 
GWASs and CNV GWASs [3-7]. In this study, we performed 
an SNP genotyping assay to evaluate three AS-associated 
SNP  candidates  (rs11249215  in  RUNX3,  rs6556416  in 
IL12B, and rs8070463 in TBKBP1) that were discovered in 
Caucasians  but  have  not  been  studied  in  Koreans.  To 
generate more reliable data, we used a large sample set in 
this study (572 AS patients and 566 healthy controls). To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of the association of these 
three SNPs in Koreans. As a result, rs11249215 in RUNX3 
was found to be significantly associated with the risk of AS in 
Koreans. However, rs6556416 in IL12B and rs4389526 in 
ANTXR2 were not replicated in Koreans.

RUNX3 (Runt-related transcription factor 3) is a member 
of  a  family  of  transcription  factors  that  are  important 
regulators of lineage-specific gene expression. Woolf et al. 
[16] demonstrated that Runx3 is highly expressed in thymic 
medulla and that it promotes the differentiation of T cell to 
CD8＋ T cells during thymopoiesis. More recently, RUNX3 
was found to be linked to human autoimmune disease and 
inflammation. For example, Fainaru et al. [17] reported that 
Runx3  knockout  mice  develop  spontaneous  eosinophilic 
lung  inflammation,  which  is  attributed  to  dendritic  cells 
becoming  insensitive  to  transforming  growth  factor  β–
induced inhibition of maturation. RUNX3 polymorphisms 
are associated with the susceptibility to autoimmune dise-
ases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriatic 
arthritis [18, 19]. Apel et al. [18] identified that RUNX3 is 
involved  in  CD8＋ T  lymphocyte  differentiation  and  is 

related  to  psoriatic  arthritis  through  a  T  cell–mediated 
mechanism. The association between the RUNX3 polymo-
rphism rs11249215 and AS has also been reported in Cau-
casian [4] and Han Chinese populations [12]. Furthermore, 
Vecellio et al. [20] demonstrated that rs4648889 in RUNX3 is 
associated with AS and that its risk allele reduces RUNX3 
expression. Consistent with previous studies, in this study, 
we  confirmed  that  rs11249215  in  RUNX3  is  significantly 
associated with the risk of AS in Koreans in the recessive 
model.  Because  the  homozygous  risk  allele  frequency  is 
important when an SNP is a recessive marker, we examined 
the homozygous risk allele frequency for rs11249215 and 
found  that  it  was  significantly  higher  in  AS  patients 
(homozygous risk allele frequencies [HoF] = 0.36) than in 
controls  (HoF  =  0.33)  (Table  2).  Of  note,  the  MAF  of 
rs11249215 in controls was largely similar to that in East 
Asians from the 1000 Genomes Project, suggesting that our 
study group was not biased and that the genotyping was 
appropriate. Because rs11249215 is located in the promoter 
of RUNX3, further studies on its molecular effects will help 
elucidate the pathogenesis of AS. In addition, considering 
that new SNPs are being reported to be associated with AS, 
other replication studies of newly identified SNPs are also 
needed.

In conclusion, we performed a replication study of three 
SNPs with a relatively large cohort of samples and found that 
rs11249215 in RUNX3 is significantly associated with the 
risk  of  AS  in  Koreans.  These  results  will  be  helpful  in 
elucidating the pathogenesis of AS and may be useful for 
developing risk prediction models for AS in Koreans.
