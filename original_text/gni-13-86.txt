Because there are clear molecular differences entailing different treatment effectiveness between Korean and non-Korean 
cancer patients, identifying distinct molecular characteristics of Korean cancers is profoundly important. Here, we report a 
web-based data repository, namely Korean Cancer Genome Database (KCGD), for searching gene signatures associated with 
Korean  cancer  patients.  Currently,  a  total  of  1,403  cancer  genomics  data  were  collected,  processed  and  stored  in  our 
repository, an ever-growing database. We incorporated most widely used statistical survival analysis methods including the 
Cox proportional hazard model, log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier plot to provide instant significance estimation for searched 
molecules.  As  an  initial  repository  with  the  aim  of  Korean-specific  marker  detection,  KCGD  would  be  a  promising  web 
application for users without bioinformatics expertise to identify significant factors associated with cancer in Korean.

Introduction

Cancer is a complex disease with heterogeneous clinical 
behaviors developed by accumulation of multiple genetic or 
epigenetic alterations. Several global research consortia have 
made great efforts to improve the understanding of cancer 
biology  and  the  development  of  more  effective  cancer 
treatments [1, 2]. Most treatment options for Korean cancer 
patients were established based on such western population 
investigations. However, there are clear molecular differences 
showing different treatment effectiveness between Korean 
and non-Korean cancer patients [3, 4]. Thus, it is very impor-
tant to identify distinct molecular characteristics of Korean 
cancer patients.

Currently,  numerous  databases  and  analysis  toolkits 
supporting  cancer  genomics  studies  have  been  reported 
[5-10]. These studies mostly support a database system for 
searching disease-associated genes or target drugs. Although 
many researchers have tried  to  develop  platforms to find 

molecular  markers  from  genomics  data,  there  are  few 
suitable web-based resources that help researchers develop 
gene  signatures  associated  with  Korean  cancer  patients. 
Collecting  Korean  cancer  genomics  data,  comparing  with 
other  data  obtained  from  non-Korean  and  estimating 
prognostic or predictive value of the genes or gene sets using 
proper statistical analyses may be a daunting task for many 
investigators, particularly clinicians and oncologists.

Here, we introduce a web-based initial repository, namely 
Korean Cancer Genome Database (KCGD), to help investi-
gators in the efforts for searching prognostic signatures in 
Korean  cancer  patients.  The  database  contains  the  gene 
expression  profile  with  clinical  data  obtained  from  more 
than 1,000 Korean cancer patients. It is designed to be simple 
to search significant molecules, for which it is available for 
instant statistical survival analyses. In addition, our database 
has gradually containing non-Korean datasets so that users 
can easily compare or validate newly identified molecules 
independently.

Methods
Collection of datasets 

We have collected and generated genomics data obtained 
from  1,304  Korean  cancer  patients  collaborating  with  a 
number  of  hospitals  in  Korea,  such  as  Seoul  National 
University Hospital (liver), Chungbuk National University 
Hospital (bladder), Chonbuk National University Hospital 
(liver,  bile  duct,  and  colon),  Yonsei  University  Severance 
Hospital (breast), Korea University Medical Center (stomach), 
and Kosin University Gospel Hospital (stomach). The data 
were  partially  deposited  to  and  freely  available  from  the 
Gene Expression Omnibus of National Center for Biotech-
nology Information. All datasets stored in the database were 
normalized using quantile normalization. Detailed reposi-
tory status was illustrated in Supplementary Table 1.

Implementations

The  system  architecture  consists  of  various  software 
frameworks  for  robust  activity.  Our  system  was  mainly 
implemented  with  JAVA-based  environment.  To  provide 
user  friendly  and  active  interfaces,  the  ICEfaces  (version 
3.3.0,  http://www.icesoft.org/)  framework  was  used.  To 
store  and  handle  the  datasets,  the  MySQL  database 
management  system  was  used  (version  5.5.11,  http:// 
dev.mysql.com).  Data  queries  on  MySQL  from  JAVA  are 
controlled  by  MyBatis,  an  XML-based  SQL  mapping 
framework (version 3.1.1, https://code.google.com/p/mybatis). 
All statistical analysis methods were implemented using R 
(version 3.0.1, http://www.r-project.org) with Bioconductor 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  3,  2015

plugins (version 2.12, http://www.bioconductor.org). Calling 
R modules from JAVA is managed by the RCaller framework 
(version 2.1.1, https://code.google.com/p/rcaller). All services 
are hosted on an Apache Tomcat web server (version 6.0.26, 
http://tomcat.apache.org).  A  schematic  diagram  of  the 
system architecture is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Supported analysis methods

Our system currently contains statistical survival analysis 
methods for identifying a signature associated with cancer 
outcome and estimating its predictive value, i.e., the Cox 
proportional hazard model, log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier 
curves. Detailed methodologies are available in the previous 
methodology paper [11]. In addition, the system determines 
the significance of a molecule using bar plots illustrating the 
landscape of intensities among patients and two or more 
group box plots with a p-value obtained from a two sample 
t test or ANOVA methods.

Results
Web-based bioinformatics tool

A  platform  to  simply  search  and  estimate  statistical 
significance of molecules across various cancer types acce-
ssible to investigators without bioinformatics or statistics 
expertise  are  available  at  the  KCGD  website  (Fig.  1).  It 
supports  dataset  search,  in  which  a  user  explores  cancer 
genomics or epigenomics datasets in Korean stored in the 
database,  and  gene  search,  which  determines  statistical 
difference  between  cancer  known  subtypes  or  prognostic

value of a molecule in which users are interested.

When  accessing  the  gene  search  module,  a  number  of 
accession identifiers including gene symbol, RefSeq (NM_* 
or XM_*), Entrez and protein accession number (NP_* or 
XP_*) can be selected, then the user input keyword(s) for 
search  and  click  the  search  button.  Although  the  search 
criteria  were  arranged  using  small  number  of  identifiers, 
most known molecule identifiers were incorporated in the 
database  by  full  text  indexing  method,  indicating  any 
molecule  identifiers  were  allowed  to  search  by  clicking 
“anything…”  category.  Clicking  the  search  button,  the 
measurement data of expression or methylation are sought 
by the keyword and matched list with molecule information 
and  thumb  nail  image  of  measurement  intensities  across 
cancers are displayed. Next, by clicking a thumb nail image, 
the system try to estimate the significance of a molecule 
using the log-rank test with Kaplan-Meier curves and display 
bar  plots  to  illustrate  the  landscape  of  intensities  among 
patients and box plots with a p-value obtained from a two 
sample  t  test  or  ANOVA  test  (Fig.  1).  With  p-values  by 
log-rank test or significance test with t test or ANOVA, the 
prognostic  value  of  a  molecule  or  its  difference  between 
cancer subtypes may be determined, respectively. The entire 
analysis  procedures  of  the  system  were  described  in 
Supplementary Fig. 2.

Statistics of datasets

Currently, we have created a database containing a total of 
1,403  patient  samples,  among  which  1,304  samples  are 
Korean  and  the  remained  99  samples  are  non-Korean 
patients for comparison. Most data in the current database 
were created by gene expression profiling (n = 1,283, 91%) 
and  the  remained  (n  =  120,  9%)  were  by  methylation 
profiling methods. The vast majority of cancer tissues (n = 
1,363, 97%) consists of liver (n = 431, 31%), breast (n = 
365, 26%), stomach (n = 307, 22%), and bladder (n = 260, 
19%), among which highly ranked three cancer types (i.e., 
liver,  breast,  and  stomach)  were  known  to  be  most 
frequently occurred in Korean. In each cancer type, we also 
designated previously known sample subtypes to support 
assessment  of  difference  of  a  molecule  between  cancer 
subtypes. In addition, survival data of liver (n = 99) and 
bladder  cancer  patients  (n  =  165)  were  involved  in  the 
database  to  instantly  estimate  the  prognostic  value  of  a 
molecule  in  which  users  are  interested  (n  =  264,  19%). 
Supplementary  Table  1  elucidated  detailed  statistics  in 
KCGD database. 

Discussion

We  have  constructed  the  KCGD  system,  a  web-based 

search  platform,  to  assist  investigators  in  estimating 
predictive  value  of  interested  genes  and  in  identifying 
molecular signatures from Korean cancer genomics data. As 
an initial repository with the aim of Korean-specific marker 
detection,  KCGD  always  open  to  collaborate  with  any 
research investigators or clinicians in Korea and is ready to 
share Korean cancer genomics data with clinical information 
to solve the critical problems in the biomedical fields. KCGD 
is  a  growing  database:  although  current  database  mainly 
contains gene expression with clinical data, the database is 
ready to handle the RNA-seq data, another gene expression 
profiling method, or any continuous numeric intensity data 
(i.e.,  methylation  or  genomic  variation).  In  addition,  for 
direct comparative genomic analysis with non-Korean data, 
we are trying to collect other genomic or epigenomic data 
from several public database including the Cancer Genome 
Atlas  consortium  and  comparative  browsing  would  be 
implemented  in  near  future.  Therefore,  we  suggest  that 
KCGD may be one of the best choice as a co-work partner 
when  users  try  to  discover  significant  novel  factors 
associated with genomic studies of Korean cancer patients.
