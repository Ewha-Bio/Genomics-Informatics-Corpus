Proteins  in  DNAJ/K  families are ubiquitous,  from  prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and function as  molecular chaperones. For 
systematic phylogenomics of the DNAJ/K families, we developed the Eukaryotic DNAJ/K Database (EDD). A total of 12,908 
DNAJs and 4,886 DNAKs were identified from 339 eukaryotic genomes in the EDD. Kingdom-wide comparison of DNAJ/K 
families provides new insights on the evolutionary relationship within these families. Empowered by ‘class’, ‘cluster’, and 
‘taxonomy’ browsers and the ‘favorite’ function, the EDD provides a versatile platform for comparative genomic analyses of 
DNAJ/K families.

Introduction

Ubiquitous  heat  shock  proteins  (HSPs)  play  essential 
roles  as  molecular  chaperones  that  protect  cells  through 
protein folding as a stress response under heat shock [1]. 
The  HSPs  are  well  conserved  in  all  eukaryotes  and 
prokaryotes [2]. The HSPs are classified on the basis of their 
approximate molecular mass (e.g., the 70-kDa species is the 
Hsp70 family). DNAJ and DNAK are members of the Hsp40 
and  Hsp70  families,  respectively  [3].  These  proteins  are 
known to cooperate in many cellular processes, such as DNA 
replication,  protein  folding,  protein  export,  and  stress 
response in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner [4-6]. The 
cooperation  of  DNAJ  and  DNAK  is  dependent  on  the 
interactions between the J domain of DNAJ and the ATPase 
domain of DNAK [7].

DNAJ proteins were classified using the J, zinc finger, and 
carboxy-terminal  domains  [8].  Type  I  DNAJs  contain  all 
three domains, while type II proteins have a J domain linked 
directly to a carboxy-terminal domain without a zinc finger 

domain.  The type III proteins include only the J domain. 
However,  such  domain  architectures  of  DNAJ  were  not 
deliberated on most eukaryotic genome annotations, which 
might cause overestimation of DNAJ entries [9, 10]. Like-
wise, many studies of DNAKs have been used without any 
unified nomenclature or notation [11, 12], although ATPase 
and peptide-binding domains had been defined [13]. Recent 
classifications  and  identifications  based  on  functional 
domains of the DNAJ/K families revealed 22, 89, and 41 
DNAJs [9, 10, 14], and 14, 18, and 17 DNAKs [11, 12, 15] in 
the yeast, Arabidopsis, and human genomes, respectively. 
However, there is no informative platform that archives the 
previously  identified  DNAJ/Ks.  Furthermore,  only  a  few 
genomes  have  systematically  identified  DNAJ/K  families, 
although  hundreds  of  genomic  sequences  are  publicly 
available. This problematic circumstance has demanded the 
development  of  a  comprehensive  platform  that  archives 
sequence  information,  classifies  them  according  to  their 
domain structures, and analyzes them using bioinformatics 
tools. The platform should provide user-friendly interfaces

and  easy  access.  Therefore,  we  developed  a  web-based 
phylogenomic  platform  called  the  Eukaryotic  DNAJ/K 
Database (EDD).

Methods and Results
Identification and classification of DNAJ/K family 
from 339 eukaryotic genomes

An automated pipeline was programmed to identify and 
classify the DNAJ/K families (Fig. 1). All protein sequences 
of the 339 genomes deposited in the Comparative Fungal 
Genomics Platform (CFGP; http://cfgp.snu.ac.kr) [16] were 
filtered according to the following description. Six InterPro 
terms  (release  12.0)  for  DNAJ  (IPR012724,  IPR008971, 
IPR003095, IPR001305, IPR002939, and IPR001623) and 
three for DNAK (IPR013126, IPR001023, and IPR012725) 
were used to retrieve corresponding sequences. When the J 
domain or any of the DNAK domains was at least 50 amino 
acids (aa), it was defined as ‘putative’, and the others were 
tagged as ‘candidate DNAJ/Ks’. The HPD tripeptide motif 
and glycine-rich region were identified from the ‘putative 
DNAJ’  sequences.  The  DNAK  family  was  clustered  by 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

sequence  similarity  (BLAST  E-value  cutoff  e-5)  using  the 
Tribe Markov clustering (MCL) algorithm [17], because no 
class has been made in this family. Finally, 12,908 DNAJs and 
4,886 DNAKs were identified and deposited into EDD. In 
the  DNAJ  family,  895,  3,172,  and  8,700  proteins  were 
classified  as  type  I,  II,  and  III,  respectively.  Twenty-one 
clusters  were  determined  in  DNAK,  and  4,853  proteins 
(99.1%) belonged to the first four clusters. 

Web-based interfaces of the EDD

First, all protein and nucleic acid sequences identified as 
DNAJ/Ks can be accessed according to class, species, and 
cluster through user-friendly interfaces, such as the ‘class’ 
and ‘cluster’ browsers on the EDD website. For example, 
statistics pages of each class were displayed using tables and 
diagrams  in  the  ‘class’  browser.  The  statistics  pages  are 
automatically updated when new data are added to the EDD. 
Secondly,  the  EDD  allows  users  to  browse  the  detailed 
information on DNAJ/Ks and to analyze it via ‘favorite’. It is 
a  customized  cyber-workbench  where  users  can  create 
folders, store favored items, and perform 10 bioinformatics 
analyses, such as BLAST search, BLASTMatrix, ClustalW, 
DNAJ/K statistics, a DNAJ class viewer, a DNAJ/K domain 
viewer,  and  a  glycine  ratio  viewer.  Especially,  ‘favorite’, 
implemented in the EDD, is specialized for the functional 
analysis of DNAJ/K proteins (e.g., DNAJ/K domain view). 
The data saved in ‘favorite’ can be shared with CFGP 2.0 for 
further  comparative  analysis  [16].  Finally,  a  highlighted 
function of the EDD is a ‘taxonomy’ browser powered by the 
‘Species-driven  User  Interface’,  which  provides  an  inter-
active interface for displaying the taxonomical hierarchy for 
DNAJ/Ks. Users can drag and drop any taxon or taxa and 
perform  sequence  download,  statistics,  class  and  cluster 
analyses, ClustalW alignment, and BLAST search.

Conclusion

The comprehensive information on DNAJ/Ks conserved 
in 339 genomes over seven phyla is a useful resource for 
molecular  chaperone  studies  in  eukaryotes.  Phylogenetic 
analysis  between  phyla  or  kingdoms  as  well  as  genomic 
analysis within a species can be performed in the EDD. The 
user-friendly web interfaces and various analysis tools im-
plemented in this database will accelerate the management 
of large-scale data. The EDD will be a novel platform for 
phylogenomic  studies  and  a  model  for  comprehensive 
genomic analyses.
