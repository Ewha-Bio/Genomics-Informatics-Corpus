CD8+ T cells are key factors mediating hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance. However, these cells are killed through HBV-induced 
apoptosis during the antigen-presenting period in HBV-induced chronic liver disease (CLD) patients. Interferon-inducible 
protein 6 (IFI6) delays type I interferon-induced apoptosis in cells. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) in the IFI6 could affect the chronicity of CLD. The present study included a discovery stage, in which 195 CLD patients, 
including chronic hepatitis B (HEP) and cirrhosis patients and 107 spontaneous recovery (SR) controls, were analyzed. The 

genotype distributions of rs2808426 (C ＞ T) and rs10902662 (C ＞ T) were significantly different between the SR and HEP 
groups (odds ratio [OR], 6.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.64 to 26.52, p = 0.008 for both SNPs) and between the SR and 
CLD groups (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021 and OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.18 to 14.44; p = 0.027, respectively). The 
distribution of diplotypes that contained these SNPs was significantly different between the SR and HEP groups (OR, 6.58; 
95% CI, 1.63 to 25.59; p = 0.008 and OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.61; p = 0.008, respectively) and between the SR and CLD 
groups (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021 and OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.18 to 14.44; p = 0.027, respectively). We were 
unable to replicate the association shown by secondary enrolled samples. A large-scale validation study should be performed 
to confirm the association between IFI6 and HBV clearance.

Introduction

Between  350  and  400  million  people  worldwide  are 
chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) [1, 2]. 
In most HBV-infected patients, spontaneous recovery (SR) 
by the host immune system is common. However, 5% to 10% 
of  patients  fail  to  recover  and  remain  as  HBV-induced 
chronic  liver  disease  (CLD)  patients  [3].  CLD,  including 
HBV-induced chronic hepatitis B (HEP) and HBV-induced 
cirrhosis (CIR), is a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma, 
which can lead to liver-related death [4]. The high mortality 
of CLD is a major problem in HBV-endemic countries [5]. In 
Korea, which is an HBV endemic area, more than 70% of 
CLD patients are infected by HBV [6, 7]. 

CD8+ T cells are key factors involved in the chronicity of 
CLD. The major roles of CD8+ T cells in HBV clearance are 

the production of interferon (IFN)-γ, which inhibits HBV 
gene expression and the assembly of HBV RNA-containing 
capsids,  and  the  induction  of  apoptosis  of  virus-infected 
hepatocytes, which requires physical contact with CD8+ T 
cells [8-11]. However, the CD8+ T cells of CLD patients 
undergo activation-induced apoptosis instead of prolifera-
tion  in  the  presence  of  antigen-presenting  cells  [12,  13]. 
Apoptosis of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in CLD patients 
and  lymphocytic  choriomeningitis  virus  (LCMV)-infected 
type  I  IFN  receptor-null  mice  is  mediated  by  B-cell  lym-
phoma  (Bcl)-2  [12,  14-16],  indicating  that  type  I  IFN  is 
critical  to  the  survival  of  antigen-specific  CD8+  T  cells 
during the transition from acute to chronic HBV infection. 
Kolumam et al. [16] reported that type I IFN acts directly on 
CD8+  T  cells  to  allow  clonal  expansion  and  memory 
formation  in  response  to  LCMV  infection.  Type  I  IFN

receptor-null  CD8+  T  cells  neither  produce  antiviral 
molecules,  including  IFN-γ,  granzyme  B,  and  tumor 
necrosis factor (TNF)-α nor show reduced survival after 
antigen- induced stimulation [16]. 

Type  I  IFN  on  CD8+  T  cells  is  critical  for  survival, 
proliferation,  and  antiviral  functions  [16].  IFNs  are  a 
well-known family of cytokines with antiviral effects [17, 
18].  IFNs  modulate  cellular  proliferation  and  stimulate 
immune  responses  through  several  IFN-stimulated  genes 
(ISGs) [19]. IFN-α-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) is a type I ISG 
[20-22] that maps to chromosome 1p35 [23] and is regu-
lated  by  the  Janus  tyrosine  kinase  signal  transducer  and 
activator of transcription signaling pathway [24]. IFI6 is a 
mitochondria-targeted  protein;  it  inhibits  the  release  of 
cytochrome c from mitochondria and delays the apoptotic 
process initiated and transduced by the TNF-related apop-
tosis-inducing ligand/caspase 8 pathway [25]. The role of 
IFI6 is strongly associated with the immune system, but its 
antiviral effects are not well known [26].

In the present study, we hypothesized that IFI6 may be a 
survival-promoting factor for CD8+ T cells and therefore a 
determinant of the chronicity of HEP. The frequencies of IFI6 
polymorphisms  in  CLD  patients  and  SR  controls  were 
compared using logistic regression.

Methods
Subjects for the case-control study

A discovery stage included 305 blood samples obtained 
from the outpatient clinic of the Gastroenterology Depart-
ment and from the Center for Health Promotion of Ajou 
University Hospital (Suwon, Korea) without gender or age 
restrictions  between  March  2002  and  February  2006. 
Samples  were  derived  from  genetically  unrelated  Korean 
patients. The experimental protocol was approved by the 
institutional review board. Samples were divided into SR 
control (n = 107), HEP (n = 111), and CIR (n = 87) groups, 
according to serological markers and biopsy results. Three 
samples in the HEP group were not genotype-replicated and 
were excluded from the analysis. Finally, 107 SR control, 108 
HEP, and 87 CIR patients were analyzed.

In the replication stage, 736 blood samples were collected 
from  Ajou  University  Hospital  and  Keiymung  University 
(Daegu,  Korea)  between  February  2006  and  September 
2012.  Samples  were  derived  from  genetically  unrelated 
Korean patients. The experimental protocol was approved by 
the institutional review board. Samples were divided into 
two 205 SR controls, 437 HEP patients, and 94 CIR patients 
according to serological markers and biopsy results.

All samples were infected with HBV and classified into 
one of the three groups, according to their HBV infection 

status, clinical data, and serological profile, by a pathologist. 
Every  6  months  for  ＞12  months,  the  218  patients  were 
subjected to serological tests for serum levels of hepatitis B 
core  antibody  (Anti-HBc  II  Reagent  Kit;  Abbott  Labora-
tories, South Pasadena, CA, USA), hepatitis B surface anti-
gen (HBsAg) (Anti-HBs; Abbott Laboratories), and hepatitis 
B surface antibody (HBsAb) (HBsAg; Abbott Laboratories). 
Liver  function  was  evaluated  by  measuring  aspartate 
aminotransferase  (AST),  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT), 
albumin, and bilirubin levels using commercially available 
assays. All samples showed elevated ALT at least once during 
the  follow-up  period  and  were  positive  for  HBV  DNA, 
irrespective  of  hepatitis  B  e  antigen  (HBeAg)  positivity. 
Patients  in  the  SR  group  were  HBsAg-negative,  HBeAg- 
negative, anti-HBs-positive, and anti-HBc-positive and had 
recovered from HBV infection. Patients in the CLD group, 
including those in the HEP and CIR groups, were HBsAg- 
positive for more than 6 months with elevated ALT and AST 
(≥2  times  the  normal  upper  limit).  Samples  that  were 
positive for anti-hepatitis C virus (Genedia HCV ELISA 3.0; 
GreenCross,  Yoingin,  Korea)  or  anti-immunodeficiency 
virus antibodies (HIV Ag/Ab combo; Abbott Laboratories) 
were excluded.

Sample preparation
All blood samples were stored at ‒80°C for the handling of 
human genomic DNA. Genomic DNA was purified using 
G-DEX  blood  genomic  DNA  (gDNA)  purification  kits 
(Intron Biotechnology Inc., Seongnam, Korea). 

The gDNA for the discovery analysis was quantified using 
the  picogreen  dsDNA  quantification  reagent  following  a 
standard protocol (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). 
The  plates  were  read  using  a  VICTOR3  1420  Multilabel 
counter (excitation 480 nm, emission 520 nm; PerkinElmer 
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), and a standard curve for gDNA 
concentration was generated using known concentrations of 
lambda DNA.

The quality of the gDNA analyzed in the replication stage 
was  determined  using  a  NanoDrop  ND-1000  UV-Vis 
Spectrophotometer (Thermo, Eugene, OR, USA). Genomic 
DNA was diluted to a concentration of 10 ng/μL in 96-well 
PCR plates.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection and 
genotyping

In  the  discovery  stage,  six  SNPs  were  selected  from  a 
public  SNP  database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/) 
for the genotyping assay: 1) polymorphic in Chinese and 
Japanese; 2) tag SNPs in Asian; 3) might have functionality 
in protein or expression level. The selected SNPs were 1) one 
SNP in the 5' flanking region (rs2808426); 2) three intronic 

16

SNPs (rs10902662, rs1316896, and rs4908351); 3) one SNP 
in the untranslated region (rs1141747); and 4) one SNP in 
the 3′ flanking region (rs2808430). The genotyping was 
performed using the GoldenGate kit according to a standard 
protocol (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Oligos were 
amplified  by  allele-specific  primer  extension.  After  hybri-
dization to a sentrix array matrix, signal  intensities  were 
read  by  BeadArray  Reader  (Illumina  Inc.).  Genotyping 
analysis  was  performed  using  GenomeStudio  software 
(version 1.5.16; Illumina Inc.). 

In the replication stage, rs2808426, which was identified 
in  the  discovery  stage,  was  genotyped  using  Taqman 
technology. The probes were labeled with FAM or VIC dye at 
the 5' end and a minor groove binder and nonfluorescent 
quencher  at  the  3'  end.  All  reactions  were  performed 
following the supplier’s protocol. SNP genotyping reactions 
were performed on the ABI PRISM 7900HT real-time PCR 
system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). After 
the PCR amplification, allelic discrimination was performed 
on the ABI PRISM 7900HT. Allele calls were made with SDS 
v2.4 software (Applied Biosystems). 

Statistical analysis 

The genetic models for the association test were divided 
according to additive (AA vs. Aa vs. aa), dominant (AA vs. Aa 
plus aa), and recessive (AA plus Aa vs. aa) models. The χ2 
test  was  used  to  assess  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium 
(HWE) in the SR, HEP, CIR, and CLD groups. The difference 
between  groups  was  determined  by  the  odds  ratio  (OR). 
ORs were presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs) and adjusted for age and sex. Each individual haplotype 
was inferred from the EM algorithm using the SAS haplotype 
procedure (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  blocks  were  checked  by  the 
Gabriel  method  using  Haploview  software  (version  4.2; 
Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA). All statistical tests 
were performed using SAS software, and the significance 
level was set at p ＜ 0.05. The probability values obtained 
were  corrected  for  multiple  testing  by  using  Bonferroni’s 
correction  and  permutation  test.  Bonferroni’s  p-value  for 
reaching significance was 0.025 (0.05/2). The Plink program 
was used to confirm the results and permutation test (n = 
100,000; http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/).

Results

The fate of the patients infected with HBV was determined 
by several factors, including host immune reactions. Type I 
IFNs play a key role in the defense against HBV infection and 
therefore  in  the  prevention  of  chronic  hepatitis.  IFI6  is 
induced  by  type  I  IFN.  To  test  the  effect  of  IFI6  poly-
morphisms on the chronicity of HEP, samples were collected 
from  SR  controls  (HBsAg－),  who  recovered  from  HBV 
infection without any treatment, and CLD patients, inclu-
ding HEP and CIR groups (HBsAg+), who were at risk of 
HBV infection. To analyze first whether variations in the IFI6 
gene were associated with the susceptibility to HEP in the 
Korean  population,  107  controls  in  the  SR  group,  108 
patients in the HEP group, and 95 patients in the CIR group 
were analyzed for six SNPs of IFI6 (n = 302). The charac-
teristics of the study subjects are summarized in Table 1. 

In the first phase or discovery stage, four out of six SNPs 
(rs1316896, rs4908351, rs1141747, and rs2808430) were 
monomorphic. Genetic variants of rs2808426 and rs10902662 
did  not  show  evidence  of  departure  from  minor  allele 
frequency and HWE in either of the groups (p ＞ 0.05). Two

genotypes  had  minor  allele  frequencies  greater  than  1% 
(Table 2). The results of the genotype analysis showed that 
the CC genotype was the most common in the rs2808426 
and rs10902662 polymorphisms in all groups. To analyze the 
genetic association between IFI6 polymorphisms and clea-
rance from CLD, HEP, and CIR, multiple logistic regression 
analysis with adjustment for gender and age was performed. 
In  the  comparison  between  SR  and  CLD  patients, 
rs2808426 was associated with CLD in a recessive model 
(OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021). In addition, 
rs10902662 showed significant differences between the SR 
and CLD groups in a recessive model (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 
1.18 to 14.44; p = 0.027). After the permutation test, the 
rs2808426  and  rs10902662  SNPs  still  had  significant 
correlations (p ＜ 0.026). After Bonferroni’s correction, only 
rs2808426 had significant correlations (p = 0.042) (Table 2).
Comparison between the SR and HEP groups showed that 
the IFI6 SNPs rs2808426 and rs10902662 in the promoter 
region were associated with a higher risk that correlated with 
the homozygous variant TT genotype in a recessive model 
(OR, 6.60; 95%  CI, 1.64 to 26.52; p = 0.008). After the 
permutation test, the rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs still 
had  significant  correlations  (p  =  0.001  in  both  genotype 
analyses),  which  were  maintained  after  Bonferroni’s  cor-
rection (p = 0.016 in both genotype analyses) (Table 2). 

The  results  of  the  multiple  logistic  regression  analysis 
comparing  the  SR  and  CIR  groups  showed  that  the 
rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs were not associated in all 
genetic models (Table 2).

The possible genetic linkage between the rs2808426 and 
rs10902662 polymorphisms in the protection against chro-
nic  HBV  infection  was  examined.  LD  blocks  were  con-
structed by the Gabriel method using Haploview software. 
The  complete  LD  block  consisted  of  rs2808426  and 
rs10902662 and showed a pairwise |D'| = 1 and r2 = 0.942, 
which reflect strong LD. The variants across IFI6 consisted of 
a  single  LD  block  structure  composed  of  two  haplotypes 
(HTs).  The  diplotype  consisted  of  HT1  C-C  (C  allele  of 
rs2808426; C allele of rs10902662) and HT2 T-T (T allele of 
rs2808426; T allele of rs10902662). The results of the HT 
estimation showed that the CC and TT haplotypes accoun-
ted  for  over  99% distribution  in  all groups. According  to 
three genetic models, estimated HTs were used for diplotype 
analysis by logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. 

In the recessive model, HT1 frequency was significantly 
different between the SR and the CLD (OR, 0.021; 95% CI, 
1.25 to 15.26; p = 0.021) and HEP (OR, 6.67; 95% CI, 1.64 
to 26.52; p = 0.008) groups. Analysis of the HT2 diplotype 
showed a significant difference between the SR and HEP 
(OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 1.64 to 26.52; p = 0.008) and CLD (OR,

dominant model (Table 3). All diplotype p-values remained 
significant after the permutation test (p ＜ 0.022), and with 
the exception of HT2 in the SR and CLD groups, almost all 
of  the  diplotype  p-values  remained  significant  after  Bon-
ferroni’s correction (p ＜ 0.042).

To  replicate  the  significant  associations  of  the  SNP 
rs2808426, 736 samples, consisting of 205 SR, 437 HEP, and 
94 CIR patients, were collected. The clinical information of 
the patients included in the analysis is summarized in Table 
1. The second-stage genotyping was performed using the 
Taqman assay. The association of rs2808426 with CLD was 
assessed  using  the  three  genetic  models,  and  multiple 
logistic regression with adjustment for gender and age was 
used as the first-stage analysis. The results of the genotype 
analysis of the second set of samples in association with CLD 
are summarized in Table 4. 

The  significance  of  the  results  of  the  first  genotype 
analysis was not maintained in the second genotype analysis. 
Furthermore, no significant associations were detected in a 
meta-analysis of the first-stage and second-stage samples 
(Table 4). 

Discussion

The rs2808426 and rs10902662 SNPs are located in the 5' 

flanking  region  and  the  first  intron  of  the  IFI6  gene, 
respectively.  These  SNPs  by  themselves  are  known  to 
regulate gene expression by causing alternative splicing or by 
changing the binding to a transcription factor or microRNA 
[21]. The presence of the rs2808426 SNP in the promoter 
region of IFI6 led us to screen for transcription factors with 
binding sites near or on rs2808426 (C ＞ T). The binding of 
several  transcription  factors,  including  isoforms  of  the 
glucocorticoid  receptor  α,  STAT4,  v-ets  erythroblastosis 
virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (ETS1), and ETS2, to the 
protective  allele  (C)  was  predicted  by  ALLGEN  PROMO 
(version  3.0.2;  http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/ 
promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3) [27]. 

Interestingly, the binding of ETS1 to the region containing 
rs2808426 T was not predicted. Differential binding of ETS1 
according  to  the  genotype  of  rs2808426  may  affect  the 
expression of IFI6. IFI6 expression by type I IFNs triggers the 
formation  of  IFN-stimulated  gene  factor  3  (ISGF3)  com-
plexes  containing  activated  STAT1/STAT2  and  IFN  regu-
latory  factor  9  and  their  translocation  into  the  nucleus, 
where they bind to the tandem IFN-stimulated regulatory 
element (ISRE) in the promoter of IFI6 [21, 28-31]. Tandem 
binding  of  ISGF3  to  the  ISRE  is  required  for  maximum 
expression of IFI6 [32], and the promoter region, including 
rs2808426, enhances IFI6 expression more than the ISRE 
region alone [21]. The ISGF3-binding site for the ISRE is

separated from the ETS1-binding site by about 1.35 kb. The 
transcription  factor  ETS1  may  regulate  the  expression  of 
intracellular adhesion molecule-1 by protein-protein inter-
action with STAT1, which is a component of ISGF3 [33]. 
Overexpression of ETS1 in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line 
enhances the expression of IFI6 up to 18.4-fold [34]. These 
data led us to speculate that the interaction between ETS1 
and  STAT1  in  the  ISGF3  complex  may  increase  the  ex-
pression of IFI6.

The present study investigated the association between 
the rs2808426 and rs10902662 polymorphisms of the IFI6 
gene and the clearance of HBV in the Korean population by 
multistage comparison between  the SR and  CLD groups, 
including the HEP and CIR groups. 

In the first stage of the analysis, significant associations 
between  the  rs2808426  and  rs10902662  polymorphism 
genotypes  and  diplotypes  were  detected.  A  risk  that  was 
associated  with  the  TT  genotype  in  rs2808426  and 
rs10902662 was detected in the comparison between the SR 

and the CLD and HEP groups. Strong LD was found between 
the SNPs rs2808426 and rs10902662, containing most of the 
promoter region. In addition, diplotype analysis showed that 
the C-C HT was associated with a higher chance of SR than 
the T-T/T-T diplotype and that the C-C HT had a protective 
effect. The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that 
rs2808426 and rs10902662 may serve as candidate genetic 
screening markers for HBV clearance or that causative va-
riants that are responsible for HBV clearance may be present 
in this LD block. 

The association between IFI6 polymorphisms and HBV- 
induced chronic disease suggest that these polymorphisms 
might  change  the  expression  level  of  IFI6  according  to 
transcription factor binding. Therefore, an increase in IFI6 
expression  that  is  associated  with  polymorphisms  of  the 
gene could inhibit the release of cytochrome c from mito-
chondria and block the transmission of the apoptosis signals 
through Bim in HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. HBV-specific 
CD8+  T  cells  would  thus  escape  from  antigen-induced 

20

apoptosis, proliferate, and then differentiate into activated 
CD8+ T cells to eliminate HBV from the host.

The results of the first-stage analysis suggested that IFI6 
polymorphisms play a significant role. In previous studies, 
CD8+ T cell-related gene polymorphisms, such as those of 
secreted phosphoprotein 1, interleukin-18, and cyclin D2, 
were reported to affect the natural course of chronic HBV 
infections in the Korean population, but the effect of their 
genetic association is minor (OR, 0.69 to 1.44) [35, 36]. 
Furthermore,  genomewide  association  studies  of  human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) region polymorphisms, including 
HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-DQ, demonstrated their 
association  with  the  chronicity  of  HBV  [37-43].  In  our 
first-stage analysis, the protective effect of the rs2808426 
and  rs10902662  polymorphisms  was  stronger  than  that 
reported  previously  in  studies  addressing  the  association 
with HBV (OR, 6.60). The genotype and diplotype distri-
bution in both groups remained significant after multiple 
testing  by  Bonferroni’s  correction  and  permutation  test. 
These results might support that genetic variation in IFI6 
affects the clearance of HBV.

A second set of samples was used to replicate the results 
of  the  first-stage  analysis.  However,  in  the  second  asso-
ciation analysis, the comparison of the SR and the HEP and 
CIR  groups  did  not  yield  significant  results,  even  when 
merging  the  first-  and  second-stage  samples  in  a  meta- 
analysis.  This  could  have  been  due  to  variation  in  the 
sampling  cohort,  environmental  interactions,  inadequate 
statistical power, or gene interactions [1, 44-49]. Further-
more, information on factors important for the progression 
of liver disease was lacking in the samples analyzed, such as 
data on alcohol consumption [50]. 

Although our data could not be reproduced, the results 
showing an association between IFI6 polymorphisms and 
HBV chronicity are significant. Our study is the first study to 
investigate the association between IFI6 polymorphisms and 
HBV clearance as an ISG. In addition, SR patients were used 
as controls instead of normal healthy subjects to show the 
effect  of  genomic  background  on  the  chronicity  of  HBV 
infection. Normal controls that never contracted HBV are 
not suitable to show the genetic effects. 

Future studies should include a larger sample size and 
additional information in the replication study to validate 
the significance of the results through epistasis and envi-
ronmental  interactions.  In  addition,  IFI6  promoter  varia-
tions  should  be  characterized  using  next-generation  se-
quencing techniques, causal variants should be identified, 
and  mechanisms  underlying  the  effect  of  IFI6  on  HBV 
clearance that is mediated by HBV antigen-specific CD8+ T 
cell survival need to be investigated. 

In the present study, an initial discovery stage showed that 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

the  rs2808426  and  rs10902662  genotypes  and  the  cor-
responding  diplotype  were  associated  with  a  higher  pro-
bability of HBV clearance in a Korean population. However, 
the results could not be replicated in a second stage with a 
different patient sample. Further studies should be aimed at 
showing how IFI6 affects HBV clearance by promoting HBV 
antigen-specific CD8+ T cell survival. Moreover, identifi-
cation  of  causal  variants  in  the  IFI6  by  including  a  large 
number of samples may help clarify the role of IFI6 on HBV 
clearance.
