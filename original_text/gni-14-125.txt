Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacteria that is responsible for gastritis in human. Its spiral flagellated body helps in 
locomotion and colonization in the host environment. It is capable of living in the highly acidic environment of the stomach 
with the help of acid adaptive genes. The genome of H. pylori 26695 strain contains 1,555 coding genes that encode 1,445 
proteins. Out of these, 340 proteins are characterized as hypothetical proteins (HP). This study involves extensive analysis of 
the HPs using an established pipeline which comprises various bioinformatics tools and databases to find out probable 
functions of the HPs and identification of virulence factors. After extensive analysis of all the 340 HPs, we found that 104 HPs 
are showing characteristic similarities with the proteins with known functions. Thus, on the basis of such similarities, we 
assigned probable functions to 104 HPs with high confidence and precision. All the predicted HPs contain representative 
members  of  diverse  functional  classes  of  proteins  such  as  enzymes,  transporters,  binding  proteins,  regulatory  proteins, 
proteins involved in cellular processes and other proteins with miscellaneous functions. Therefore, we classified 104 HPs into 
aforementioned functional groups. During the virulence factors analysis of the HPs, we found 11 HPs are showing significant 
virulence. The identification of virulence proteins with the help their predicted functions may pave the way for drug target 
estimation and development of effective drug to counter the activity of that protein.

Introduction

Helicobacter  pylori  is  a  Gram-negative  bacteria  that  is 
associated with several gastric problems in human. It is a 
slow growing microaerophilic bacteria [1]. Its spiral shape 
flagellated body helps in locomotion and invasion on the 
host cells. It belongs to the class of bacteria that are res-
ponsible for most common bacterial infections in human [2]. 
It is adapted to the acidic gastric environment for survival. It 
is also indigenous to the worldwide human population. It 
was  first isolated  by Marshall and Warren  in  1984  [3-5]. 
Prolonged infection of the organism can be transformed into 
a chronic infection that causes severe gastric diseases such as 

duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer, gastric lymphonema and cancer 
[6,  7].  Nonchronic  infection  of  the  bacteria  is  usually 
asymptomatic. There is usually no development of clinical 
disease observed in the infected person. The prevalence of 
infection  is  also  guided  by  the  variations  in  geographical 
conditions,  age,  race,  and  socioeconomic  status  of  the 
infected persons [8-10]. A person having bacterial infection 
at an early age is more prone to develop a chronic infection 
[11-13]. H. pylori infection in developing countries is higher 
in  comparison  to  the  developed  countries.  The  reason 
behind this may be poor hygiene practices in the developing 
countries [14]. 

The H. pylori genome was first sequenced in 1997 [5]. The 
genome of H. pylori 26695 strain (NC_000915.1) contains

AAT  Naqvi, et al.  Hypothetical  Proteins  from  Helicobacter pylori

1,555 coding genes and 65 pseudogenes. The GC content of 
the  genome  is  38.9%.  The  coding  genes  in  the  genome 
encode 1,445 proteins, seven rRNAs, and 36 tRNAs. The 
genome contains 340 predicted gene products characterized 
as hypothetical proteins (HPs). 

In this study, we have analyzed the sequences of all the 
HPs  from  H.  pylori  to  assign  probable  functions.  The 
objective  is  to  identify  putative  virulence  proteins  in  the 
proteome  that  help  in  pathogenesis.  We  have  used  an 
established protocol [15, 16] for the function prediction of 
the  HPs  that  comprises  leading  bioinformatics  tools  and 
databases [17-19]. The analysis goes in a systematic way of 
predicting physicochemical properties of the proteins using 
ProtParam.  Then,  subcellular  localization  using  different 
programs  is  carried  out  to  assist  the  function  prediction. 
Identification of transmembrane helices (TMHs) in the HPs 
to find out membrane protein is carried out using TMHMM 
and  HMMTOP.  We  have  analyzed  the  HPs  for  similarity 
searching using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). 
Protein-protein  interaction  is  helpful  in  assessing  the 
function of novel proteins. We have used Search Tool for the 
Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database for pre-
dicting  protein-protein  interaction  networks  for  the  HPs. 
The classification of the HPs is done using CATH, Structural 
Classification of Proteins (SCOP), Pfam, SVMProt, and Pro-
tein Analysis through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER) 
database. Conserved domain discovery and motif search in 
the  HPs  are  carried  out  using  Conserved  Domain  Archi-
tecture Retrieval Tool (CDART), Simple Modular Architec-
ture  Research  Tool  (SMART),  InterProScan,  and  Motif, 
respectively. We have made final predictions on the basis of 
a  consensus  approach  [20-22].  The  putative  function 
predicted by four or more programs for an HP is considered 
the probable function of that HP with high precision and 
high  confidence  [17,  23].  Finally,  we  have  successfully 
assigned putative functions to 104 HPs out of 340 HPs with 
high precision. Furthermore, we have classified proteins on 
the  basis  of  their  involvement  in  the  various  biological 
process  and  predicted  molecular  functions  into  diverse 
functional  groups  such  as  enzymes,  binding  proteins, 
transporters, and proteins involved in cellular processes and 
into the proteins exhibiting miscellaneous functions.

Methods 
Data abstraction 

In  this  study,  the  primary  source  of  genome  data  is 
National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI) 
genome  database.  We  extracted  preliminary  information 
using “Helicobacter pylori” string that redirects to the genome- 
wide project report of H. pylori genome. We selected H. pylori 

26695 strain from the database with the Accession Code 
RefSeq  NC_000915.1.  The  genome  contains  1,555  genes 
coding  for  1,445  proteins.  We  then  extracted  the  hypo-
thetical proteins from the pool of 1,445 proteins. We used 
Uniprot for retrieving Uniprot IDs and fasta sequences of the 
HPs using their Protein Product IDs (e.g., NP_206816.1). 
Fasta sequences of the HPs retrieved from Uniprot were used 
for further analysis. 

Physicochemical parameterization 

Physicochemical  properties  of  the  proteins  help  in 
deducing the biochemical characteristics of the proteins and 
functional characterization. We used Expassy’s ProtParam 
[24] server for estimation of physicochemical parameters of 
the HPs. ProtParam server is equipped with modules that are 
capable of predicting an array of physicochemical properties 
using predefined formulas and experimental inferences. We 
predicted  relative  molecular  weight,  theoretical  pI, 
extinction coefficient, instability index, aliphatic index, and 
grand  average  of  the  hydropathicity  of  the  HPs  using 
ProtParam.  All  these  properties  help  in  identifying  the 
probable function of the proteins. Data for physicochemical 
parameterization are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Sub-cellular localization

The function of a protein is very well influenced by its 
location in the cellular space. For instance, proteins of the 
exoproteomic  pool  and  secretory  proteins  often  play  an 
essential role in virulence related activities such as adherence 
to  host  cells.  We  used  an  array  of  tools  to  carry  out  the 
subcellular localization of the HPs. We used PSORTb [25], 
PSLpred [26], and Cello [27] to predict the location of HPs 
in  the  cell.  These  predictors  use  experimental  data  from 
known proteins to make predictions for query proteins using 
their fasta sequences. They predict the possible occurrence 
of protein in diverse cellular or extracellular localities such as 
cytoplasm, periplasm, inner membrane, outer membrane, or 
extracellular space. To predict signal peptides in the HPs, we 
used SignalP [28] prediction platform for the existence of 
signal peptides in the HPs, which is a characteristic feature of 
membrane-bound  proteins.  SecretomeP  [29]  server  was 
used to find out nonclassical secretory proteins among the 
HPs.  Prediction  of  TMHs  in  the  proteins  helps  in  the 
identification of membranous proteins. We used HMMTOP 
[30]  and  TMMHMM  [31]  for  this  purpose.  Both  these 
programs  use  Hidden  Markov  Model  (HMM)  profiles  of 
training data set to predict TMHs in query sequences. The 
supplementary data are given in Supplementary Table 2.

Identification of virulence proteins

The present work put stress upon the identification of 

126

potential virulence proteins in the pool of HPs. Pathogenic 
bacteria  contain  a  range  of  virulence  proteins  in  their 
pathogenesis  machinery.  There  are  adhesins,  exotoxins, 
endotoxins, and secretion systems, etc., that comprise the 
virulence  moiety  of  pathogenic  bacteria.  We  used  Viru-
lentPred [32] and VICMpred [33] for the identification of 
virulence  factors  among  the  HPs.  Both  these  tools  are 
Support Vector Machine (SVM) based using 5-fold cross- 
validation  processes  to  validate  the  results.  VirulentPred 
uses the strategy of two-way predictions, i.e., non-Virulent 
or  Virulent  whereas  VICMpred  categorizes  proteins  into 
four classes namely proteins involved in cellular processes, 
metabolism  protein,  information  molecule,  and  virulence 
factors.  It  has  a  training  set  of  670  proteins  from  Gram- 
negative  bacteria  including  70  known  virulence  factors. 
Information  for  virulence  factors  analysis  is  provided  in 
Supplementary Table 3. 

Homology and function prediction

The assertion of homology between proteins derived on 
the basis of sequence similarity provides insights into the 
functional  properties  of  an  unknown  protein  showing 
similarity with a protein of known function. BLAST [34-37] 
is a commonly used and most reliable tool for the purpose. 
Structure and function prediction help to identify novel drug 
targets  which  can  be  further  utilized  for  therapeutic 
intervention [38-46]. We used blastp module to search for 
homologous  proteins  to  the  HPs  against  a  database  of 
nonredundant  protein  sequences.  To  decrease  the  redun-
dancy in the results, a threshold was set for the e-value less 
than 0.0005 and sequence identity more than 30%. SMART 
[47] was used for the function prediction. It uses information 
about  domain  architecture  from  known  proteins  and 
provides functional annotation of query sequences. Function 
prediction based on motif discovery was performed using 
InterProScan  [48]  and  Motif.  InterProScan  searches  the 
query sequence against Interpro consortium to bring about 
the function of the proteins using motif information. Motif 
operates as an interface between user and motif library of 
known  databases.  It  searches  the  query  sequence  against 
Pfam,  TIGRFAM,  COG,  SMART,  PROSITE  Patterns,  and 
PROSITE profiles. The user has the facility to choose any of 
these  databases.  We  also  used  STRING  [49]  to  predict 
protein-protein interaction networks for the HPs. It gives 
functional  insights  for  the  HPs  based  on  protein-protein 
interaction.  Information  for  homology  and  function  pre-
diction is listed in Supplementary Table 4.

Classification and domain assignment

Protein  classification  and  domain  assignment  using 
sequence  similarity  search  may  give  ample  evidence  for 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

function prediction of the HPs. We have used an array of 
databases  and  retrieval  tools  such  as  CATH  [50], 
SUPERFAMILY [51], PANTHER [52], Pfam [53], CDART 
[54], SVMProt [55], and ProtoNet [56] for the classification 
of the HPs. CATH provides the classification of Protein Data 
Bank (PDB) protein structure repository. CATH v4.0 release 
contains 235,858 domains, 2,738 superfamily and 69,058 
annotated PDBs. SUPERFAMILY database provides struc-
ture and functional annotation of proteins based on HMM 
using  SCOP  classification  system.  PANTHER  is  another 
efficient  protein  classification  database  based  on  HMM 
profiles. PANTHER provides a multi-way classification of 
proteins  on  the  basis  of  family  and  subfamily,  molecular 
function, involvement in a biological process, and associa-
tion with a pathway in any cellular process. It reduces the 
risk of redundancy by applying strict HMM scoring strategy. 
We also used Pfam for the classification of HPs. Pfam is a 
database  of  protein  families  with  representative  multiple 
sequence alignments and HMMs for each family. SVMProt 
was also used for functional classification of the HPs. It is a 
SVM based classification software trained with the dataset of 
about  54  functional  families  of  protein.  We  performed 
cluster-based  classification  of  the  HPs  using  ProtoNet.  It 
gives a hierarchical classification of proteins using clusters of 
proteins  showing  functional  similarity.  The  information 
about the classification of the HPs is given in Supplementary 
Table 5.

Results 

Sequences of 340 HPs from H. pylori 26695 strain tested 
with exclusive pipeline developed by our group [23, 57]. We 
used several tools for the sequence analysis such as, BLAST, 
CATH, SCOP, CDART, InterProScan, Motif, protein family 
databases,  conserved  domain  databases,  protein  cluster 
database,  protein-protein  interaction  database,  and  other 
such analysis tools such as virulence predictors, subcellular 
localization prediction programs, etc. Data produced by all 
these methods and prediction programs help us deducing 
results. We successfully assigned probably functions to 104 
HPs with high confidence (Table 1). As mentioned earlier, 
the basis of the confidence level was consensus based, i.e., 
the similar function for an HP predicted by four or more 
programs  was  considered  function  for  the  HP  with  high 
confidence  and  precision.  To  reduce  redundancy  and  to 
maintain  the  reliability  of  the  results,  we  deliberately 
omitted the HPs for which functions were predicted with low 
level and less precision.

Discussion
Classification of the HPs

For  the  ease  of  the  approach  for  understanding  the 
probable  involvement  of  these  HPs  in  pathogenesis,  we 
categorized all 104 HPs into various functional groups on the 
basis  of  their  individual  molecular  function  and  their 
involvement  in  various  biological  processes  (Fig.  1).  We 
found  27  HPs  showing  similarities  with  various  enzyme 
classes like oxidoreductases, hydrolases, transferases, etc. 
Ten HPs are categorized as transporters, 26 showing features 
of binding proteins, 23 HPs have predicted to be involved in 
various  cellular  and  regulatory  processes  and  18  HPs  are 
listed  in  the  category  of  proteins  showing  miscellaneous 
functions.  These  HPs  are  further  studied  and  extensively 
analyzed  using  previously  available  literature  and  experi-
mental studies. 

Enzymes, having catalytic properties, play a substantial 
role in the life of a living organism to provide biochemical 
machinery for various cellular and regulatory processes. We 
found 27 HPs showing similarities experimentally charac-
terized  enzymes  representatives  of  enzyme  classes.  HP 
O25317 showed similarity  with disulfide  bond  formation 
protein  DsbB.  Disulfide  bonds  provide  stability  and 
maturation strength to the protein thus, DsbB has a critical 
role in the development of substantial protein machinery 
that may be involved in the metabolic or regulatory pathways 
[58]  of  that  pathogen,  therefore,  helping  in  the  patho-

transporters  (n=10),  binding  proteins  (n=26),  cellular  processes/ 
regulatory  proteins  (n=23)  and  miscellaneous  functions  (n=18).

genesis.  Out  of  27  enzymes,  five  HPs  are  categorized  as 
transferases.  HPs  O25589  and  O25870  are  showing 
similarity with acetyltransferase family protein and glycosyl-
transferase  family  9  (heptosyltransferase),  respectively. 
Both  these  HPs  are  predicted  virulent  in  virulent  factors 
analysis. Glycosyltranferases facilitate the “biosynthesis of 
disaccharides,  oligosaccharides,  and  polysaccharides”  by 
catalyzing the transfer of sugar moieties [59]. HP O25870 is 
predicted heptosyltransferase may be a potential drug target. 
Heptosyltranferase help in the formation of the core region 
of lipopolysaccharides which constitute the major component 
outer membrane structure in Gram-negative bacteria [60]. 
About 60% of all predicted enzymes belong to hydrolases 
enzyme class and most of them are involved in metabolic 
pathways. In the predicted hydrolases, there are ATPases, 
restriction  endonucleases,  phosphoesterases,  etc.,  that 
facilitate the processes of transcription, translation, func-
tional group localization, and other such essential activities 
that  help  in  the  development  and  propagation  of  the 
pathogen  inside  the  host.  There  are  four  HPs  showing 
similarities with member proteins of lyase enzyme class. HP 
O25309 is showing similarity with aminodeoxychorismate 
lyase and is predicted as virulent factor. Aminodeoxychorismate 
lyase  is  a  class  member  of  pyridoxal-phosphate-binding 
protein class IV which helps in the biosynthesis of tetrahyd-
rofolate by aminodeoxychorismate to para-aminobenzoate. 
Tetrahydrofolate is an essential precursor in purine biosyn-
thesis [61].

Transporters have always remained a subject of interest 
during  the  process  of  novel  drug  discovery  against  the 
pathogenic  diseases.  Transporters,  due  to  their  specific 
evolution  making  them  capable  of  transporting  essential 
molecules,  are  involved  in  a  wide  range  of  metabolic 
pathways and other important cellular processes. H. pylori 
genome has an ample amount of genes that encode a large 
number of transporter proteins, mainly ATP-binding cassette 
(ABC) transporters. In the predicted HPs, we found 10 HPs 
showing  characteristic  similarity  with  transporters.  HPs 
O26020, and O26021 are showing similarity with ABC-2 
family  transporter  proteins.  ABC  transporters,  specific  to 
prokaryotes, are the leading molecules that fulfill the energy 
requirement of the organism for diverse biological processes 
[62]. The required amount energy that they provide comes 
from the hydrolysis of ATP molecules performed by ABC 
transporters  [63]  having  specifically  evolved  domains  for 
ATP hydrolysis. We found HP O26042 is showing similarity 
with  ferrichrome  iron  receptor  (fhuA).  Iron  uptake  is 
believed to be preferential activity in H. pylori for the survival 
in the host system [64]. fhuA is an outer membrane trans-
port protein which catalyzes the transport of ferrichrome 
and also acts as a receptor for T5 phages in Escherichia coli and 

130

other toxic substances [65]. HP O26042 is also predicted 
virulent in virulence factors analysis. Thus, it can be con-
sidered potential drug target. 

Twenty-six  HPs  are  characterized  as  binding  proteins. 
These  proteins  are  further  specified  according  to  their 
functions as adhensin, DNA-, RNA-, protein-, nucleotide-, 
metal-  and  lipid-binding  proteins.  Some  of  the  repre-
sentative members of this group are may be known involved 
in leading cell activities, transcription, translation, and other 
regulatory processes. In this group, we have identified four 
HPs  showing  characteristics  of  restriction  modification 
proteins, three of which belong to type I and one belong to 
type II. All these proteins may have an essential role in DNA 
modification. HP O25934 is showing  similarity with type-1 
restriction  enzyme  ecoKI  specificity  protein  (hsdS)  and 
predicted  virulent  by  both  VICMpred  and  VirulentPred. 
Type-1 restriction enzyme ecoKI specificity protein belongs 
to  the  class  of  S-adenosyl-L-methionine  dependent 
endonucleases  that  are  constituents  of  bacterial  DNA 
restriction-modification  mechanisms,  which  guards  the 
organism from foreign DNA invasion [66]. We identified HP 
O25749 showing positive virulence and exhibiting similarity 
with  tetratricopeptide  repeat  (TPR)  protein.  TPR  is  a 
signature  motif  of  proteins  regulating  protein-protein 
interaction  and  the  formation  of  multiprotein  complexes 
[67]. Proteins with TPR motifs are involved in important 
biological  processes  such  as  cell  cycle,  protein  folding, 
transcriptional regulation, etc. [68]. Involvement in leading 
processes makes them liable to be treated as potential drug 
targets. We found two HPs O25618 and O25619 are showing 
significant similarity to dynamin like GTPases. The function 
of dynamin GTPases is well studied in eukaryotes. They are 
involved in membrane fusion and fission mediated by the 
hydrolysis of GTP molecules but the exact function of their 
prokaryotic counterparts, despite the existence of structural 
data, is not well understood and needs a further probe to 
straighten out their role in prokaryotes [69]. 

We  have  identified  23  HPs  may  be  involved  in  diverse 
cellular  processes  and  regulatory  mechanisms.  Proteins 
mediating  the  formation  of  cell  envelope  such  flagellar 
biosynthesis  proteins,  flagellar  motility  proteins  are 
signature members of this group. Flagella is responsible for 
bacterial motility in a host environment which helps in the 
colonization of the pathogen [70]. H. pylori is equipped with 
“five to seven unipolar” flagella that are protected against 
gastric  acidity  due  to  the  presence  of  a  covering  sheath 
formed of phospholipids [71]. There are a relatively higher 
number of genes in H. pylori that encodes flagellar proteins 
supporting the fact that motility facilitates the colonization 
of the pathogen in the host body; thus, their association with 
bacterial virulence is also subjected to consideration in the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

course of drug discovery. HP O26095 is showing similarity 
with  flagellar  biosynthetic  protein  flhb  that  mediates  the 
formation of flagella. It may be a potential drug target. We 
found HP O25564 similar to flagellar hook-length control 
protein FliK that controls the length of the flagellar hook 
during flagellar biosynthesis [72]. In the H. pylori genome, 
there are seven known genes encoding molecular chaperons. 
We have identified HP O25894 is showing homology with 
molecular chaperon. DnaJ, is signature member of the family 
of  molecular  chaperons  that  exhibit  a  diverse  number  of 
molecular functions such ATP binding, metal ion binding, 
unfolded  protein  binding  and  is  involved  in  a  number  of 
leading  biological  processes  like  protein  folding,  protein 
unfolding, DNA replication, and response to heat shock, etc. 
[73].  The  involvement  of  chaperons  in  essential  cellular 
processes required for survival and propagation of pathogen 
make them potential drug targets for the development of 
effective drugs against pathogenicity. 

Though we have categorized HPs in the definite functional 
classes on the basis of their molecular functions and their 
involvement in diverse biological processes, but there HPs 
which exhibit some unique functions or functions are not 
clearly classified in the available literature. We put those HPs 
in the group of proteins exhibiting miscellaneous functions. 
HP  O25579  is  identified  as  toxin  like  outer  membrane 
protein  and  showing  significant  virulence  in  virulence 
factors analysis. We found HP O25993 similar to lipoprotein 
with positive virulence. Despite the fact that H. pylori infects 
the host in the free environment, evidence for adherence to 
epithelial cells of the gastric tissues of the host are also found 
[64]. Outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins have an 
effective role in cell adhesion in H. pylori [5]; thus, they may 
be  taken  as  strong  candidates  for  drug  targets.  We 
identified HP O25713 similar to neuraminyllactose-binding 
hemagglutinin  (NLBH)  with  substantial  virulence.  In  H. 
pylori, NLBH, which is also a lipoprotein, has an effective role 
in adhesion to the gastric epithelium of the host [74]. We 
identified three characterized genes in the H. pylori genome 
that  encodes  NLBH  proteins  at  distant  locations.  The 
specific function of NLBH signifies its virulence making it a 
potential therapeutic target.

Virulence factors 

As  discussed  in  the  last  section,  we  have  performed 
virulence factors analysis for all the 340 HPs to bring about 
virulent  proteins  that  play  an  effective  role  in  the  pro-
pagation of disease. We preferable selected consensus-based 
approach  for  the  purpose  of  taking  the  results  of  both 
predictors VICMpred and VirulentPred as positive. Thus, we 
found  22  HPs  predicted  virulent  by  both  these  programs 
(Table 2). While looking for the virulent proteins in the array

of 104 predicted HPs, we found 11 HPs showing positive 
virulence that are mentioned in Table 1. Concrete specifica-
tion of virulence proteins amongst the predicted functional 
candidates  paves  the  way  for  further  studies  on  drug 
discovery and development in a more focused way. Therefore, 
results of virulence factors analysis hold significant in the 
lookups for further study and experimental characterization 
of predicted HPs. 

Subcellular localization

Identification of subcellular location of the protein in a 
computer  based  functional  analysis  is  significant  because 
there is a strong relation between the function and location 
of the protein in cellular space [75, 76]. It also gives insight 
into the determination of probable drug target or vaccine 
target among the identified virulent proteins. For the newly 
assigned  104  HPs,  we  deduced  their  relative  subcellular 
locations  from  the  results  of  subcellular  localization  pre-
diction  discussed earlier  on the basis  of  consensus-based 
approach. Relative subcellular locations of predicted HPs are 
given in Table 1. We also classified the predicted HPs based 
on their subcellular locations (Fig. 2). Associating the results 
of  subcellular  localization  with  those  of  virulence  factors 
analysis may help in the identification of probable drug or 
vaccine targets.

In conclusion, computational sequence analysis of HPs in 
order to find out possible functional clues is an extensive

work and need much patience for each gene is individually 
analyzed with an array of tools and databases. The inferences 
are drawn with a sensitive approach to discard the possi-
bilities of false-positives. Due to the occurrence of similar 
looking patterns, prediction software may predict different 
function for similar HP than that predicted by another tool. 
Therefore,  we  have  selected  a  more  sensitive  consensus- 
based  approach,  cross-checking  the  results  of  all  used 
programs  and  then  deducing  inferences  on  the  basis  of 
majority rule. Majority rule is the criteria taking the function 
predicted by four or more tools as the probable function of 
the HP. This way, we have successfully predicted probable 
functions  of 104  HPs  with  high level  confidence.  A  wide 
range  of  HPs  showing  functional  similarities  with  the 
proteins  those  play  an  essential  role  in  bacterial  patho-
genesis. The study may pave the way for experimentalists to 
look  forward  to  the  possibilities  of  in  vitro  functional 
characterization of virulent proteins that may be considered 
potential therapeutic targets in the process of drug discovery.
