Metabolic syndrome (METS) is a disorder of energy utilization and storage and increases the risk of developing cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes. To identify the genetic risk factors of METS, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) 
for 2,657 cases and 5,917 controls in Korean populations. As a result, we could identify 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms 
‒8 ≤ 
‒4). On the other hand, 
the multiple correction criteria of conventional GWASs exclude false-positive loci, but simultaneously, they discard many 
true-positive  loci.  To  reconsider  the  discarded  true-positive  loci,  we  attempted  to  include  the  functional  variants 
(nonsynonymous  SNPs  [nsSNPs]  and  expression  quantitative  trait  loci  [eQTL])  among  the  top  5,000  SNPs  based  on  the 
proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genotypic variance. In total, 159 eQTLs and 18 nsSNPs were presented in the 
top 5,000 SNPs. Although they should be replicated in other independent populations, 6 eQTLs and 2 nsSNP loci were located 
in the molecular pathways of LPL, APOA5, and CHRM2, which were the significant or suggestive loci in the METS GWAS. 
Conclusively,  our  approach  using  the  conventional  GWAS,  reconsidering  functional  variants  and  pathway-based  inter-
pretation,  suggests  a  useful  method  to  understand  the  GWAS  results  of  complex  traits  and  can  be  expanded  in  other 
genomewide association studies.

Introduction

Metabolic  syndrome  (METS)  is  a  disorder  of  energy 
utilization and storage and increases the risk of developing 
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. METS includes multiple 
clinical traits, as follows: increased plasma glucose, abdo-
minal obesity, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure [1]. 
METS is a great concern in developing countries, because the 
prevalence  of  METS  is  gradually  increasing,  especially  in 
countries where it follows obesity trends, sedentary lifestyle, 
and high consumption of calories [2-4]. A Korean twin study 
showed that the METS has 51%–60% heritability, indicating 
a significant role of genetic factors in the development of 
METS  [5].  Therefore,  understanding  the  genetic  factors 
underlying the syndrome and their correlation is clinically 

important.

Recent  advances  in  high-throughput  genomics  tech-
nologies have allowed massive testing of genetic variants in 
minimal time [6, 7]. The reductions in cost and time have 
made it feasible to conduct large-scale genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWASs) that genotype many thousands of 
single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  thousands  of 
individuals. So far, approximately 1,900 reports with 13,000 
SNPs (GWAS catalog; Apr 14, 2014) have been published to 
identify the gene-disease or -non-disease trait associations. 
The quantitative traits related to METS have already been 
studied by the conventional GWAS in the Korean population 
[8], but there is no Korean GWAS report about METS cases 
and controls.

On the other hand, relatively little trait heritability can be 
explained  by  the  conventional  GWAS  [9].  These  pheno-

mena, called missing heritability problems, are hard to solve 
by  conventional  GWAS,  in  part  because  of  the  extensive 
multiple testing correction in GWAS analysis, low effect size 
of common variants, and the difficulty of detecting low-fre-
quency  or  rare  variants  in  conventional  GWAS.  Multiple 
testing correction is necessary to exclude false-positive loci, 
but simultaneously, it discards many true-positive loci [10]. 
Also, most SNPs in these GWASs lie in intergenic and intron 
regions and do not appear to affect protein sequence. Thus, 
these SNPs are likely functionally neutral or just proxies of 
causal variants located in the same linkage disequilibrium 
(LD). To understand the amount of true-positive signals in 
the  discarded  association  results,  we  computed  the  pro-
portion [V(G)/V(P)] of the phenotypic variance [V(P)] that 
is  explained  by  the  genotype  variance  [V(G)]  using  the 
significant and discarded SNP results [11]. 

Recently,  Fransen  et  al.  [10]  reported  a  GWAS  using 
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) information. They 
selected eQTL among the GWAS results for Crohn’s disease 
and  conducted  follow-up  replication  studies  [10].  They 
showed  that  eQTL-based  pre-selection  for  follow-up  is  a 
useful approach for identifying risk loci from a moderately 
sized GWAS.

Based on previous knowledge, we applied an alternative 
analysis strategy to understand the genetic components of 
METS. First of all, we conducted a conventional GWAS for 
METS cases and healthy controls to discover the top signi-
ficant signals. Thereafter, we tried to uncover the functional 
variants,  such  as  nonsynonymous  SNPs  (nsSNPs)  and 
eQTLs, among the SNPs to be discarded using the stringent 
criteria  of  the  conventional  GWAS.  Finally,  we  drew  a 
pathway of the significantly associated GWAS SNPs and the 
remaining less significantly associated functional SNPs. The 
overall study design is schematically described in Supple-
mentary Fig. 1.

Methods
Study subjects

The study subjects were originally derived from a part of 
the  Korean  Genome  and  Epidemiology  Study  (KoGES) 
project, which was the national project to establish genome 
epidemiology  cohorts  of  Korean  dwellers  or  immigrants/ 
emigrants  [12].  Among  the  KoGES  cohorts,  the  Korean 
Association Resource Consortium (KARE) has established a 
public GWAS dataset by using the Ansan-Anseong cohort, 
which is an ongoing biennially followed-up cohort in the 
KoGES [13]. The KARE dataset consists of the individual 
SNP chip genotypes and the epidemiological/clinical pheno-
types for studying the genetic components of Korean public 
health.  Written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all 

participants  at  the  KoGES,  and  this  research  project  was 
approved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Korea 
National Institute of Health (KNIH). The obtained KARE 
dataset passed the quality control criteria and was reported 
in previous GWAS reports [8, 13]. Briefly, the subjects with 
genotype accuracies below 98% and high missing genotype 
call rates (≥5%), high heterozygosity (＞30%), or incon-
sistency  in  sex  were  excluded  from  subsequent  analysis. 
Individuals who had a tumor were excluded, as were related 
individuals whose estimated identity-by-state values were 
high (＞0.80). Based on these criteria, 8,842 samples were 
selected; these quality control steps have been described in a 
previous GWAS [13].

Study phenotypes and covariates

We  used  the  general  information  on  resident  areas 
(Anseong or Ansan), sex, and age as the covariates and past 
disease history of diabetes, hypertension, and lipidemia as 
exclusion criteria for non-METS healthy controls. The height 
and body weight were used to calculate the body mass index 
(BMI) as another covariate, and waist circumference (WC), 
systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP), fasting 
plasma  glucose  levels  (GLU0),  high-density  lipoprotein 
(HDL)  cholesterol,  and  triglyceride  (TG)  were  used  to 
diagnose METS. METS was defined by the presence of three 
or more of the following five components according to the 
NCEP-ATPIII criteria using WC for Asians [14, 15]: WC 
(≥90 cm for men and  ≥80 cm for women), HDL (＜40 
mg/dL  for  men,  ＜50  mg/dL  for  women),  TG  (≥150 
mg/dL), SBP (≥130 mm Hg) and/or DBP (≥85 mm Hg), 
and GLU0 (≥100 mg/dL).

Study genotypes

The genotyping of the cohort population was previously 
described for the KARE study [16]. Most DNA samples were 
isolated  from  the  peripheral  blood  of  participants  and 
genotyped using Affymetrix Genomewide Human SNP array 
5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The quality 
control  steps  of  the  genotypes  have  been  described  else-
where  [13].  Briefly,  the  calling  of  the  genotyping  was 
determined by Bayesian Robust Linear Modeling using the 
Mahalanobis  Distance  genotyping  algorithm  [17].  Con-
sequently, 352,227 SNPs had a missing genotype call rate 
below 0.1, a minor allele frequency greater than 0.01, and no

Additionally,  the  previous  GWAS  reported  no  population 
stratification between the Anseong and Ansan cohorts [13].

Statistical analysis

The LD between the previously reported GWAS SNPs and 
the SNPs of the current GWAS was investigated with SNAP 
web-based software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/ 
snap) and GWAS catalog (http://www.genome.gov/gwastu-
dies/). For example, we entered our top significant SNPs in 
the SNAP input panel and found high LD SNPs with r2 ＞ 0.9 
and  D'  =  1  around  1  Mbp.  The  high-LD  SNPs  were 
investigated  in  the  GWAS  catalog  (http://www.genome. 
gov/gwasstudies)  as  to  whether  they  were  previously  re-
ported or not. 

–5 ≤ p ＜ 1 × 10

To  maximize  the  candidate  risk  factors  of  METS,  we 
selected additional functional SNPs in the eQTLs or nsSNP 
–4). Among the Affymetrix 5.0 
loci (5 × 10
SNPs,  we  investigated  the  eQTL  SNPs  from  regulomeDB 
(http://regulomedb.org)  and  the  nsSNPs  from  BioMart 
(http://www.biomart.org).

The genetic variances of the top association SNPs were 
estimated by GCTA v1.24 [16], which is a tool for estimating 
the proportion [V(G)/V(P)] of phenotypic variance [V(P)] 
explained by SNPs [V(G)] for complex traits. We selected 
the SNP sets based on the GWAS p-values from 100 to 1,000 
SNPs with 10-SNP intervals and from 1,000 to 5,000 SNPs 
with 1,000-SNP intervals. We decided the number of SNPs in 
the  maximum set  based on  the genetic variance approxi-
mated the METS heritability reported from the Korean twin 
study  [5].  The  pair-wise  genetic  relationships  were  esti-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

mated using the make-grm option, and the proportion of the 
phenotypic variance explained by the associated SNPs was 
estimated by the grm-test option with the restricted max-
imum likelihood [11].

In silico analysis

The functional relevance of the associated SNP sites was 
analyzed by overlapping the gene-coding sequence or the 
Encyclopedia of DNA Element (ENCODE) regulatory ele-
ment positions in the University of California Santa Cruz 
(UCSC)  genome  browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). 
Thereafter,  regulomeDB  (http://regulome.stanford.edu/) 
was  utilized  to  extract  eQTL  information.  In  addition, 
Pathway  Studio  version  9.0  software  (Ariadne  Genomics, 
Rockville, MD, USA) was utilized to analyze the functional 
interactions and possible pathways among genes/proteins in 
our  data.  It  provides  an  interpretation  of  the  biological 
implications  from  gene/protein  expression  data,  the 
establishment of molecular pathways, and an identification 
of protein interaction maps and their association to cellular 
process [19].

(rs11216126)  and  3  suggestive  SNPs  (rs6589566,  rs174 
82753, and rs10503669) were previously reported as being 
associated  with  METS-related  traits,  such  as  serum 
cholesterol levels or TG levels [8, 20, 21].

LD  analysis  using  10  SNPs  was  conducted  with  the 
previously reported GWAS SNPs. As a result, 5 SNPs had 
strong LD with the 15 highly linked GWAS SNPs (Table 3) 
[23-34].  Among  the  6  remaining  SNPs  associated  with 
METS  in  our  GWAS  results,  2  SNPs  (rs180349  and 
rs17410962) showed high LD with the previously reported 
SNPs (r2 ＞ 0.9 and D' = 1) even though the 2 SNPs have not 
been reported regarding metabolic traits.

Therefore,  we  discovered  10  significant  or  suggestive 
associated SNPs in the METS GWAS, but 6 of them were 
already  reported  or  linked  to  the  reported  SNPs.  The 
remaining  4  suggestive  signals  and  2  functional  variants 
have  been  first  reported  in  the  current  study,  and  a 
replication study should be performed in other independent 
populations.

In silico annotation of the linked genes and 
functional relevance

The 10 associated SNPs and the LD SNPs were located in 
six functional gene regions, and one SNP was located in the 
intergenic region. The top signals were located downstream 
of  a  functional  spliceosome-associated  protein,  named 
BUD13, a homolog of yeast (BUD13) gene chromosome 11 
and near the BUD13 gene. BUD13 has been reported to be

associated with lipid, metabolic syndrome X [23], TG [32], 
and metabolic traits in East Asians [8], demonstrating that it 
is  putatively  functionally  associated  with  METS  in  the 

Korean population (Supplementary Table 1).

function  showed  that  rs651821  was  located  in  the  5' 
untranslated region (UTR) of the APOA5 gene, and also, the 
SNP was reported as an eQTL of the transgelin (TAGLN) 
gene (Table 4). The results indicate that the remaining SNPs 
are surrogate markers of rs6589566. Among them, rs651821 
and  rs964184  are  associated  with  TG  level,  as  one  com-
ponent of METS evaluation, in Chinese populations [26] and 
in Mexicans [35]. Both SNPs exhibit eQTL of the TAGLN 
gene. TAGLN has been documented as a repressive regulator 
of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene expression [36] 
and  is  considered  a  putative  tumor  suppressor  due  to 
suppression  of  MMP-9,  which  harbors  tumor  metastatic 
properties  [37].  However,  MMP-9  is  also  involved  in  the 
progression of METS via chymase activity [38] and has been 
suggested  to  be  used  a  diagnostic  marker  of  METS  [39]. 
Thus, it can be explained that the functional eQTL TAGLN of 
rs651821  and  rs964184  could  be  a  novel  marker  for  the 
evaluation of METS in terms of strong regulation of MMP-9.
The third most significant signals were located in the lipo-
protein lipase (LPL) gene region. Three SNPs (rs10503669, 
rs17482753, and rs17410962) located in chr 8 were eQTL 
that contributed to LPL expression in monocytes. LPL is a 
critical  protein  of  lipid  metabolism  and  is  significantly 
associated with METS in Asian Indians [40], indicating that 
the  functional  eQTL-SNP  of  LPL  expression  could  be  a 
marker for the evaluation of METS in Korean populations. 
Those three SNPs were in strong LD with rs328, which is a 
stop-gain  mutation  of  the  LPL  coding  sequence  [41] 

(Supplementary Table 1). Although the remaining 14 SNPs 
were non-eQTL-SNPs, those SNPs have been reported as 
being  in  association  with  HDL  cholesterol,  low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, TG, and obesity, indicating that they 
are putative candidate markers for the evaluation of METS.
Although the remaining 6 SNPs and their nearest genes 
have not been functionally studied regarding METS-associ-
ated traits, further studies are required to elucidate for their 
role in METS.

Pathway network analysis

The results of the V(G)/V(P) for 100 to 5,000 SNPs were 
plotted in Fig. 2. When we used 5,000 SNPs, V(G)/V(P) 
approximated 50%, and we extracted functional SNPs, such 
as  eQTLs  and  nsSNPs,  from  the  5,000  SNPs.  We  could 
extract 159 eQTLs and 18 nsSNPs among the 5,000 SNPs 
(Supplementary  Table  2).  Notably,  6  eQTL  genes  and  2 
nsSNP genes consisted of LPL and the apolipoprotein A-V 
(APOA5) pathway through the interaction of a number of 
mediated genes (Table 4). Among them, muscle creatinine 
kinase (CKM) has been documented to regulate LPL activity 
[42],  demonstrating  that  it  is  putatively  associated  with 
METS. Those additionally identified genes might be candi-
date targets of METS for further study (Fig. 3).

number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Approximately
50% of phenotypic variance could be explained by the top 5,000
SNPs.

eQTLs and nsSNPs provide insights into the regulation of 
transcription and aid in the interpretation of GWASs [22]. 
Most of the eQTL resources are available in online databases, 
such as RegulomeDB (http://regulome.stanford.edu/), in-
cluding  several  published  resources  in  various  cell  types, 
such as monocytes [43], human brain [44], lymphoblastoid 
cell  lines  [45,  46],  and  human  liver  [47].  Probably, 
RegulomeDB  is  one  of  the  most  useful  eQTL  databases, 
because it contains rich information about the products of 
the ENCODE project, such as transcription factor binding 
sites, chromatin structure, histone modification, and eQTLs. 
Our pathway results suggest an internal mechanism of LPL, 
APOA5, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 (CHRM2) 
functions in METS. Therefore, we suggest that 6 eQTLs and 
2 nsSNP loci might be additional targets for further asso-
ciation studies and functional analysis.

Conclusively, our approach using the conventional GWAS, 
reconsidering  functional  variants  and  the  pathway-based 
interpretation, suggests a useful method to understand the 
GWAS results of complex traits and can be expanded in other 
GWASs.
