Abstract

family,  member  N, 

The  H1  histone 
testis-specific 
(H1FNT)  is  exclusively  expressed  in  the  testis,  and  had 
its  possible  role  for  sperm  chromatin  formation.  The  pur-
pose  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  any  genetic  associa-
tion  of H1FNT  gene  with  male  infertility,  especially  at  the 
promoter  region.  We  examined  the  promoter  single  nu-
cleotide  polymorphisms  (SNP)  of  H1FNT  gene  which  is 
located  within  transcription  factor  binding  site  for  its  as-
sociation  with  male  infertility.  The  statistical  analysis 

showed  that  the −1129A＞T  polymorphism  was  pres-

ent  at  a  statistically  significance  in  male  infertility  (p= 
0.0059  and  0.0349 
for  hetero  and  risk  type,  re-
spectively).  The  dual-luciferase  promoter  assay  was  per-
formed  to  examine  the  polymorphic  effect  of  this  pro-
moter  SNP  by  the  cloning  of  promoter  region  (1700bp 
fragment)  into  pGL3-basic  vector.  In  our  plasmid  based 
reporter  system,  there  is  no  big  difference  between  wild 

and  risk  type.  In  conclusion,  H1FNT  −1129A＞T  pro-

moter  SNP  is  statistically  significant  with  male  infertility, 
especially  with  subfertile 
(non-azoospermia)  group. 
Further  analysis  of  its  functional  polymorphic  effect  in 
vivo  may  provide  the  biological  significance  of  tes-
tis-specific  histone  with  spermatogenesis.

Introduction

H1  histone  family,  member  N,  testis-specific  (H1FNT)  is 
exclusively  expressed  in  the  testis  with  a  correlation  of

its  histone  like  role  during  the  spermatogenesis  (Tanaka 
et al.,  2006).  The H1FNT  is  essential  for  normal  sperma-
togenesis  and  male  fertility  (Martianov  et al.,  2005; 
Tanaka et al.,  2005).  The  human H1FNT  is  reported  to 
be  important  in  the  sperm  chromatin  formation  (Tanaka 
et al.,  2006).  In  the  spermiogenesis,  the  physiological 
role  of  the  H1FNT  is  related  with  the  chromatin  con-
densation  (Tanaka  et al.,  2005).  With  the  homozygous 
Hanp1/H1T2  (mouse  H1FNT)  knockout  mice  study, 
there  was  abnormal  chromatin  packing  and  nuclear  for-
mation  in  the  sperm  (Kimura et al.,  2003).  Male  infertility 
is  reported  in  case  of  the  homozygous  Hanp1/H1T2  mu-
tant  male  mice  with  abnormal  sperm  morphology  and 
the  reduced  sperm  motility  (Miyagawa  et al.,  2005; 
Tanaka et al.,  2003). H1FNT  gene  is  located  on  the  long 
arm  of  chromosome  12  (12q13.11),  and  has  one  exon 
spanning  a  length  of  1,300bp,  encodes  a  protein  of  ap-
proximately  255  amino  acids.  Previous  SNP  analysis  of 
H1FNT  gene  showed  that  five  common  cSNPs  (coding 
SNP)  showed  no  genetic  association  with  male  infertility 
from  Japan  (Tanaka  et al.,  2006). 
    Since  H1FNT  is  the  testis  specific  histone  gene,  so 
we  investigated  any  genetic  variation  in  promoter  region 
of  the H1FNT  with  male  infertility  from  Korea  population. 
We  also  investigated  any  polymorphism  effect  of  statisti-
cally  significant  promoter  SNP,  and  analyzed  its  clinical 
significance  of  testis  specific  histone. 

Methods

Patients  and  controls

Two  hundred  three  healthy  fertile  men  who  had  at  least 
one  child  and  who  lacked  any  history  of  requiring  as-
sisted  reproduction  technology  were  included  as  the  na-
tion-wide  control  group.  Members  of  this  group  were 
identified  at  the  Division  of  Genome  Resources,  National 
Genome  Research  Institute,  National  Institute  of  Health, 
and  Seoul,  Korea.  Two  hundred  twenty-nine  non-azoo-
spermia  (subfertile)  patients  were  recruited  from  the 
CHA  General  Hospital,  College  of  Medicine,  CHA 
University  from  January  2000  to  August  2003,  (Seoul, 
Korea).  Semen  analysis  was  performed  with  infertile 
males  further  sub-divided  following  semen  analysis  per-
formed  strictly  according  to  the  World  Health  Organiza-
tion  (WHO)  guidelines  (WHO)  (2001).  The  sub-division

written  informed  consent  for  participation  in  the  study. 
The  non-azoospermia  group  (n=229)  was  used  for  this 
study.  Exclusion  criteria  contains  chromosome  abnor-
mality  including  Klinefelter  syndrome  (47,  XXY)  and  Y

Pyrosequencing  for  genotyping

The  PCR  primers  were  designed  using  PRIMER3  site 
(http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/)  and  pyrosequencing  pri-
mers  were  designed  PSQ  assay  design  version  1.0 
software.  The  PCR  was  carried  out  using  30ng  of  ge-
nomic  DNA  and  10pmol  each  of  the  forward  and  re-
verse  oligonucleotide  PCR  primers  (Integrated  Bioneer, 
Daejeon,  Korea).  These  primers  generate  a  127bp  frag-

ment  from  nucleotide −1210  to −1083  upstream  of  the 
transcription  start  site.  The  following  PCR  conditions 
were  used:  predenaturation  at  95oC  for  5  minute,  dena-
turation  at  95oC  for  1  minute,  annealing  at  52oC  for  30 
seconds,  and  extension  at  72oC  for  30  seconds  for  35 
pyrosequencing  analysis  for  direct  analysis  of  the  −
cycles.  The  biotinylated  PCR  product  then  underwent 

1129  polymorphism  on  PCR  product  according  to  the 
published  method  (Park  et al.,  2005;  Yun  et al.,  2008). 
The  sequences  of  all  oligonucleotides  in  this  study  are 
listed  in  Table  1.  The  genomic  location  of  rs2261608 
was  indicated  at  Fig.  1.  rs2261608  is  located  at  -1129 
bp  upstream  of  transcription  start  site  of  H1FNT1.

to  measure  the  Firefly  and  Renilla  luciferase  activities 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  method.

Results 

The  promoter  analysis  H1FNT  by in silico  model 

Since  H1FNT  is  the  testis  specific  histone  gene,  so  we 
investigated  any  genetic  variation  in  promoter  region  of 
the H1FNT  from  Korea  population.  To  identify  any  tran-
scription  factors  in  the  polymorphic  site  of  the  H1FNT 
promoter,  we  did  in  silico  analysis  by  using  the 
web-based  bioinformatic  model  (http://www.cbrc.jp/re-
search/db/TFSEARCH.html and http://www.gene- regulation. 
com)  (Heinemeyer  et al.,  1999;  Matys  et al.,  2003). 
There  is  only  one  SNP  existed  at  the  promoter  region 
which  two  transcription  factors  can  bind  (Fig.  1).  Our in 
silico  analysis  showed  that  HOXA7  and  CDX2  can  bind 

to  the  −1135∼−1125  (＋1  indicate  the  transcription 

start  site)  and −1135∼−1129  region  which  re2261608 
existed.  Therefore, −1129  A  to  T  transversion  may  alter 

the  transcription  factor  binding  affinity in vivo,  and  could 
affect  its  transcription  level.

Genotyping

First,  we  analyzed  the  H1FNT  −1129A＞T  SNP  from 

non-azoospermia  (n=229)  and  fertile  (n=203)  males.  The 
SNP  analysis  was  conducted  by  pyrosequencing  assay 

for −1129A＞T  polymorphisms,  and  statistical  analysis 
of  the  −1129A＞T  results  in  fertile  and  non-azoo-
the heterozygous −1129A＞T (AT), homozygous −1129A＞
T  (TT), −1129  (AT＋TT)  and  T  allele  in  the  group  with 

spermia  males  are  shown  in  Table  2.  The  frequencies  of 

frequencies  of  heterozygous  −1129A＞T 

non-azoospermia  were  statistically  significant  (p＜0.05). 
The 
(AT) 
among  the  fertile  and  non-azoospermia  were  19.7  and 

30.57%  (p  =  0.0059),  respectively  and  homozygous −

1129A＞T  (TT)  among  the  fertile  and  non-azoospermia 
were  0.5  and  3.05%  (p=0.0349),  respectively.  The  fre-

quencies  of −1129  A→T  substitution  in  one  or  both  al-

leles  (AT＋TT)  and  T  allele  of  non-azoospermia  were 
33.62  and  18.34%,  respectively  (p=0.0018  and  p=0.0005). 

Clinical  significance:  Sperm  parameter  analysis

Genetic  analysis  of H1FNT −1129A＞T  SNP  data  show 
non-azoospermia.  Therefore,  we  further  investigated −

that  there  is  strong  association  of  this  SNP  with 

1129A/T  genotype  with  sperm  cell  pathophysiology,  and 
analyzed  its  association  with  sperm  parameters.  The 
sperm  parameter  information  was  available  from  non- 
azoospermia  (n=144).  From  the  analysis  of  sperm  pa-

Dual-luciferase  promoter  assay

We  found  that  H1FNT −1129A＞T  polymorphism  was 

significantly  associated  with  non-azoospermia.  Functio-
nal  promoter  assay  was  performed  to  investigate  any 

polymorphic  effect  of  −1129  A＞T  SNP.  For  reporter 

assay,  we  used  three  reporters,  pGL3-Wild,  pGL3-Risk 
and  pGL3-Dele  (Fig.  2A),  The  dual-luciferase  assay 
showed  that  the  cloning  of  promoter  region  (1700bp)  of 
H1FNT  into  pGL3-basic  increased  the  total  luciferase 
activity,  but  there  is  no  change  of  activity  between  wild 
(pGL3-Wild)  and  mutant  type  (pGL3-Risk)  (Fig.  2B). 
pGL3-Dele  (Deletion)  vectors  which  deleted  of  tran-

scription  binding  sites  (Δ−1129  to  −1135)  has  also 

similar  activity  to  other  reporters  (Fig.  2B). 

Discussion
Our  study  showed  that  the  H1FNT  −1129A＞T  pro-

moter  polymorphism  (rs2261608)  has  strong  genetic  as-
sociation  with  male  infertility. 
    We  analyzed  the  clinical  significance  of  this  promoter 
SNP.  However,  there  was  no  direct  association  of 

sperm  parameter  with  this −1129A＞T  genotype  from 

non-azoospermia  group  (n=144).  Interestingly,  our  data 
showed  that  this  SNP  is  only  associated  with  non-azoo-
spermia  group  (low  quality  of  spermatozoa  in  the  ejacu-
late),  but  not  with  azoospermia  group  (no  spermatozoa 
in  the  ejaculate).  Therefore,  our  data  suggested  that  this 
SNP  affect  total  process  of  spermatogenesis,  but  may 
be  in  part.  Further  analysis  of  this  genotype  with  sperm 
parameters  may  be  required  with  the  expanded  sub-
fertile  group.
    Functionally,  we  expected  that  this  promoter  SNP  may 
regulate  its  transcriptional  level.  In  our  plasmid  based 
reporter  system,  there  is  no  polymorphic  effect  of  this

promoter  SNP.  Our in silico  analysis  showed  two  possi-
ble  transcription  factors  can  bind  to  the  promoter  of 

H1FNT  which  included  this −1129A＞T  SNP  site.  The 

transcriptional  regulation  of  H1FNT  may  be  performed 
under  very  complicated  condition  during  spermato-
genesis,  and  so  further  analysis  of  H1FNT  expression in 
vivo  may  be  required  for  the  analysis  of  this  genotype.
Our  genetic  association  study  of  H1FNT  with  male  in-
fertility  is  the  first  positive  genetic  study  with  male  in-
fertility,  especially  with  non-azoospermia  in  our  know-
ledge.  Further  functional  and  clinical  study  of  H1FNT 
may  provide  its  biological  significance  of  spermato-
genesis.
