Abstract
Most common diseases are caused by multiple genetic 
and environmental factors. Among the genetic factors, 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are common 
DNA sequence variations in individuals and can serve as 
important genetic markers. Recently, investigations of 
gene-based and whole genome-based SNPs have been 
applied  to  association  studies  for  marker  discovery. 
However, SNPs are so population-specific that the association 
needs to be verified. Fifty-five genes and 384 SNPs were 
selected based on association with disease. Genotypes 
of 337 SNPs in candidate genes were determined using 
Illumina Sentrix Array Matrix (SAM) chips by an allele- 
specific  extension  method  in  364  unrelated  Korean 
individuals. Allelic frequencies of SNPs were compared 
with  those  of  other  populations  obtained  from  the 
International HapMap database. Minor allele frequencies, 
linkage disequilibrium blocks, tagSNPs, and haplotypes 
of functional candidate SNPs in 55 genetic disease-associated 
genes  were  provided.  Our  data  may  provide  useful 
information for the selection of genetic markers for gene- 
based genetic disease-association studies of the Korean 
population.

common type of variant in the human genome and the main 
source  of  phenotypic  differences  between  individuals 
(Sachidanandam  et  al.,  2001).  SNPs  may  influence 
complex  diseases  by  a  variety  of  mechanisms.  By 
changing the amino acid sequence encoded by DNA, they 
may reduce, abolish, or increase functions such as DNA 
binding,  protein-protein  interactions,  enzyme  catalytic 
activity,  or  receptor-ligand  contact  (In  et  al.,  1997; 
Kammerer et al., 2004; Knight et al., 2004). SNPs also can 
affect aspects of RNA and protein processing, including 
stability, transcription, translation, and translational modification 
(Ozaki et al., 2004; Skoog et al., 1999; Wilson et al., 1997).
Genome-wide association studies have shown that 
variations in human genome sequences in close physical 
proximity  often  are  strongly  correlated  (Gabriel  et  al., 
2002). The correlation structure, or linkage disequilibrium 
(LD), is complex and varies from one region of the genome 
to another, as well as between different populations (Hinds 
et al., 2005). The selection of a maximally informative 
subset of common SNPs for use in association studies is 
required  to  assess  the  causal  roles  of  common  DNA 
variations in complex human traits (Patil et al., 2001). There 
have been many studies indicating that identification of 
genetic variants in association studies is valuable in the 
development of pharmaceutical  products and  medical 
diagnostics (Cardon and Abecasis, 2003; Cargill et al., 
1999; Knight, 2003; Knight, 2005). The National Center for 
Biotechnology Information public SNP database (dbSNP) 
(Sherry et al., 2001), the Genetic Association Database 
(GAD) (Becker et al., 2004), the SNP Consortium website 
(Thorisson  and  Stein,  2003),  and  the  International 
HapMap database (Thorisson et al., 2005) are very valuable 
resources for information on genomic polymorphisms. 
SNP databases and programs are being developed to 
search for disease-candidate SNPs. Because gene-based 
SNP research is being pursued vigorously, selection of 
SNP candidates from SNP databases is thought to be 
essential in gene-based association studies.

We tested a hypothesis that selection of candidate 
genes  and  SNPs  using  bioinformatics  software  and 
servers is an efficient means of functional SNP discovery. 
Fifty-five genes were selected from a database that is an 
archive of human genetic association studies of complex 
diseases  and  disorders.  Most  of  these  genes  have 
significant association with various diseases from other 
populations, but  not in  Koreans. SNPs were selected 

based on their functional and positional importance using 
databases. Allelic frequency, LD, and haplotype frequency 
of SNPs were determined using healthy, unrelated Koreans 
compared with other ethnic groups using the International 
HapMap database. The results of this study may provide 
information helpful for the selection of functional candidate 
SNPs in gene-based disease-association studies.

Materials and Methods
Reagent
Reagents for the Sentrix Array Matrix were obtained from 
Illumina Inc (San Diego, California, USA). Other reagents 
were purchased Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 

Genomic DNA samples
The 364 unrelated Korean umbilical cord blood cohort 
samples used in this study were obtained from Medipost, 
Inc (Seoul, Korea). The samples and informed consents 
received  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approval. 
Information  on  all  of  the  samples,  including  gender, 
neonatal body weight, maternal age, and disease pedigree 
were obtained from Medipost, Inc. Genomic DNA was purified 
using Gentra DNA purification kits (Gentra, Inc. Minneapolis, 
USA).  The  Centre  d’Etude  du  Polymorphisme  Humain 
(CEPH) parents and offspring trio genomic DNA samples 
were obtained from the Illumina Inc. for genotype testing.

Selection of disease-associated genes and SNPs
Fifty-five candidate genes for common diseases were 
selected from the Genetic Association Database (GAD), 
which is an archive of human genetic association studies 
of complex diseases and disorders (Becker et al., 2004). 
Polymorphisms in the 55 disease-associated genes were 
significantly associated with human diseases such as 
Alzheimer disease, asthma, atopy, cancer, diabetes, heart 
disease, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. Selected genes 
were described in Bioinformatic Harvester (http://harvester.fzk. 
de/harvester/) and the Online Mendelian Inheritance in 
Man (OMIM) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ omim/) 
(Table 1). SNPs of the 55 genes may be good candidates 
for association studies of complex diseases in Koreans 
because SNPs of their candidate genes were significantly 
associated with diseases in other ethnic populations.

We used bioinformatics servers and software to identify 
SNPs in genes. Selection of SNPs in promoter regions was 
achieved using Alibaba software that predicted transcription 
factor binding sites affected by the nucleotide exchange 
generated by SNPs. SNPs in introns and exons were 
selected within the <500 bp exon boundary, and nonsynonymous 

SNPs in Disease-Associated Genes 153

SNPs were predicted in exons. The SNPs selected for 
genotyping were located in exons (n = 104), introns (n = 
139), and untranslated regions (UTRs; n = 141). 

Genotyping using Sentrix Array Matrix chips
Genotyping was performed using the Sentrix Array Matrix 
(SAM) system (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) 
as described by Fan and co-workers (Fan et al., 2003). 
DNA  samples  were  assayed  according  to  the  SAM 
protocols supplied by Illumina, Inc. The procedure was 
similar to the one described previously. Briefly, genomic 
DNA (250 ng) was immobilized on streptavidin-coated 
magnetic beads. Allele-specific extension was carried out 
by ramping the temperature from 70ºC to 30ºC over 16 hr. 
After extension, excess oligonucleotides were washed out 
with 50 uL of MEL (master mix for extension/ligation) 1 
buffer and 50 uL of UB (universal buffer) 1. The master mix 
for ligation (37 uL) was added to the extension products 
and incubated for 15 min at 45ºC. The products were 
washed and resuspended in 35 uL of IP (inoc PCR) 1 buffer 
and heated at 95ºC for 1 min. The products were incubated 
on a magnetic plate for 2 min. The Illumina-recommended 
Titanium Taq DNA Polymerase mixture (30 uL, BD-Clontech) 
was added to the uracil DNA glycosylase mixture (UDG, 
Illumina, Inc.) in new plates. The supernatants (30 uL) from 
the magnetic plates were used for PCR with a reaction 
profile of 35 s at 95ºC, 35 s at 56ºC, and 2 min at 72ºC, for 
34 cycles. Purification of the PCR products was accomplished 
using 96-well filter plates (Millipore, USA). All samples 
were transferred to a 384-well microplate. The arrays were 
hydrated in UB2, 0.1 N NaOH, and UB2 buffer. Hybridizations 
were conducted at 60ºC for 30 min and at 45ºC for 16 hr. 
After hybridization, the arrays were washed twice with UB2 
and once with IS (Image SAM) 1 buffer at room temperature 
with mild agitation, and imaged at a resolution of 0.8 um 
using a BeadArray Reader (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis 
Data  analysis  was  performed  by  Illumina’s  GenCall 
software (Version 6.1.3.24) for genotyping distribution. 
MAF, LD, and haplotype frequencies for genes were estimated 
using HapAnalyzer (Jung et al., 2004) and Haploview 
software (Barrett et al., 2005). Ethnic differences in allele 
frequency were calculated by taking the absolute of the 
subtraction of the minor allele of groups at each SNP site.

GenCall software (Fig. 1A). Cross-contamination, accuracy, 
and heritability errors were tested using a blank sample 
and genomic DNA from six families of Centre d’Etude du 
Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH). Each family was composed 
of four sets of parents and offspring trios. Successful 
genotyping  was  accomplished  for  337  SNPs  (87.8%) 
compared with 47 failed SNPs (12.2%) (Fig. 1B). SNP 
failure occurred because of inexact clustering, revealing 
inheritability error in the data. The observed concordance 
in genotyping was 99.6% (122,151 out of 122,668). Two 
hundred nineteen of the 337 SNPs were polymorphic 
(65%, MAF >0.05), while the remaining 118 SNPs (35%) 
were  either  monomorphic  (86  SNP;  25.5%)  or  of  low 
frequency (32 SNP; 9.5%, MAF < 0.05) (Fig. 1B and C). 
Successfully  genotyped  337  SNPs  were  located  as 
follows:  36  in  promoter  regions  (5’-UTR  flanking  and 
5’-UTR), 95 in exons (non-synonymous), 173 in introns (exon- 
intron  boundary),  and  33  in  the  3’-UTR  and  flanking 
sequences (Table 1). The chi-square test indicated a deviation 
from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) of 21 among 
251 polymorphic SNPs (p <0.05) (Fig. 1D). Genotype 
frequencies and HWE of other genes are shown on our

including Japanese (JPT), Chinese (CHB), Caucasian 
(CEU), and African (YRI), which have been genotyped in 
the International HapMap Project (Thorisson et al., 2005) 
(Fig. 2A). MAFs were found to be very similar between 
KOR, CHB, and JPT, but showed differences between 
KOR, CEU, and YRI. Differences in allele frequencies 
were the absolute differences of the minor allele frequency 
in Koreans from those of the same allele of other ethnic 
populations (Fig. 2B, C). The differences in allele frequencies 
varied depending on ethic group (Table 2). Patterns of 
different SNP frequencies of the ethnic populations are 
described in Table 3. rs6078 and rs5896 were monomorphic 
or high-frequency in YRI and CEU, whereas the same sites 
were polymorphic in KOR at frequencies of 0.324 and 
0.398, respectively. In contrast, rs662 was monomorphic 
in  KOR  whereas  it  was  polymorphic  in  YRI  (0.217). 
rs1899951, rs2287499, rs6356, rs4305, and rs1875796 
had higher frequencies in YRI than in KOR, whereas 
rs2972164 had lower frequencies in YRI than in KOR. 
rs4135329 was only polymorphic in YRI. Frequencies of 
other SNPs are available on our website (Supplementary 
Table 2).
Pairwise  linkage  disequilibrium  mapping  and 
frequencies
Haplotype frequencies for each pair of SNPs and for all 
SNPs within a gene were estimated within the Korean 
population using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. 
To consider patterns of LD, we examined genes in the 
Korean population containing at least 2 SNPs. Measures 
of pairwise LD were calculated using the confidence interval 
method in Haploview software (version 3.2) for all pairs of 
SNPs in each gene (Gabriel et al., 2002).

Discussion
Genetic variations influence the development of cancers 
and  other  diseases,  and  are  important  for  population 
genetics, genetic disease research, and drug development 
(Weiss et al., 2001). Because of many genes are involved 
in  the  development  of  diseases  and  many  SNPs  are 
responsible for altered binding sites in promoters or altered 
splicing regions or altered protein functions, association 
studies using SNPs are finding increasing numbers of 
disease target genes (Knight et al., 2004; Ozaki et al., 
2004). SNP research is necessary for understanding the 
role of candidate genes in disease. Recently, information 
was  published  on  several  hundred  genes  from  many 
different ethnic groups that had statistically significant 
associations with various diseases (Becker et al., 2004). 
Results of many studies using the same ethnic groups led

to controversial conclusions.

We investigated allele frequencies of 332 SNPs in 
disease-associated  genes  in  Koreans  compared  with 
Caucasian, African, Japanese, and Chinese populations. 
Genes were selected that had a strong association with 
disease, as determined by statistical significance and 
repeated publications. The 332 SNP sites in the selected 
genes were chosen by a similar strategy. Fifty SNP sites 
that might be involved in transcription factor binding were 
selected by prediction using Alibaba software (data not 
shown). Sixty-nine nonsynonymous SNPs were selected 
on the basis that these SNPs might have effects on protein 
structure  and  function.  These  operationally  important 
SNPs―common functional SNPs―were selected using 
bioinformatic tools that were available from the internet.
Genotyping was performed on 322 functional SNPs 
from  55  disease-associated  genes  from  unrelated 
individuals in the Korean population. Haploview and HapAnalyzer, 
which were available from the internet, were used for 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing and determination of 
SNP frequencies, LD blocks, haplotypes, and statistical 
analysis (Fig. 1 and 3; Supplementary Table 1).

The  common  disease-common  variant  hypothesis 
suggests that common diseases are influenced by susceptibility 
alleles at a few loci that occur with high frequency across 
ethnically diverse populations (Hirschhorn et al., 2002; 
Tishkoff and Verrelli, 2003). In the Korean population, 158 
of  the  322  SNPs (49%)  had  minor  allelic frequencies 
greater than 10% at the 0.05 probability level (Fig. 1). 
These results indicate that at least 158 SNPs may confirm 
this hypothesis. 

Differences  in  alleles  of  several  SNPs  were  found 
between different ethnic populations (Table 2 and 3, Fig. 
2). Also, our results indicate that African and Caucasian 
populations  have  similar  frequencies  in  most  of  the 
variants, as opposed to the Asian populations (Korean, 
Japanese, and Chinese). Data from the Korean, Japanese, 
and Chinese populations revealed similar allelic frequencies 
among these Asian groups (Fig. 2). Because difference 
between populations, SNPs should be carefully selected 
from  SNPs  database  for  association  studies. In  other 
words, our data indicate that the SNP database is limited 
in  information  on  MAFs  of  certain  populations.  As  a 
consequence, it is necessary to conduct more SNP studies 
in each population.

Haplotypes  are  combinations  of  alleles  that  differ 
among different populations (Tishkoff and Verrelli, 2003). 
LD plays a central role in the current and proposed methods 
for mapping complex disease genes. Haplotype blocks 
indicate high LD and low haplotype diversity (Pritchard and 
Cox,  2002).  The  discovery  of  functional  variations  is 
important for understanding normal phenotypic variations 

and susceptibility to genetic disease (Cardon and Abecasis, 
2003; Crawford et al., 2004; Tanaka et al., 2003). Vitamin 
D  is  an  important  factor  for  bone  development  and 
maintenance of bone mass, and it is the principal factor 
required for control of normal calcium and phosphate 
homeostasis  (Uitterlinden  et  al.,  2002).  VDR  gene 
polymorphism has been reported to influence calcium 
intake with regard to bone mineral density (Kiel et al., 1997), 
and  growth  and  parameters  of  body  composition 
(Lorentzon et al., 2000). PPARG2 has been associated 
with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and inconsistently 
with obesity and overall adiposity (Ghoussaini et al., 2005). 
We have described the LD block structure, haplotype 
frequencies, and tagSNPs in these disease-associated 
genes  in  samples  from  unrelated  individuals  (Fig.  3). 
These tagSNPs may be used for the design and analysis 
of genetic association studies, testing variants that are 
common in the population and that may have a role in 
complex traits and common diseases.

In summary, we have described SNP frequencies and 
haplotype frequencies for functional candidate SNPs in 55 
candidate genes in unrelated individuals from the Korean 
population. Our data proved that SNPs are ethnospecific 
and should be selected very carefully. Our data may help 
guide selection of SNPs from 55 candiate genes tested in 
this study for association studies. Additional case-control 
studies will be necessary to determine the precise effects 
and function of our selected SNPs. Our results may also 
contribute 
fields  of  medicine, 
pharmaceutical development, functional genomics, and 
human evolutionary biology.
