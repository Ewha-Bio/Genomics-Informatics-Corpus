MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play an important role in carcinogenesis. Previous studies revealed that 
miRNAs are present in human plasma in a remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity. In this 
study,  we  measured  the  plasma  expression  levels  of  three  miRNAs  (miR-21,  miR-27a,  and  miR-155)  to  investigate  the 
usefulness of miRNAs for gastric cancer detection. We initially examined plasma miRNA expression levels in a screening 
cohort  consisting  of  15  patients  with  gastric  cancer  and  15  healthy  controls  from  Korean  population,  using  TaqMan 
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that the expression level of miR-27a was significantly higher 
in  patients  with  gastric  cancer  than  in  healthy  controls,  whereas  the  miR-21  and  miR-155a  expression  levels  were  not 
significantly higher in the patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, we further validated the miR-27a expression level in 73 
paired gastric cancer tissues and in a validation plasma cohort from 35 patients with gastric cancer and 35 healthy controls. 
In both the gastric cancer tissues and the validation plasma cohort, the miR-27a expression levels were significantly higher in 
patients with gastric cancer. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of the validation cohort, revealed an area under 
the ROC curve value of 0.70 with 75% sensitivity and 56% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer. Thus, the miR-27a 
expression level in plasma could be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of gastric cancer.

Introduction

In the past decade, gastric cancer has become of the most 
common malignancies worldwide. Despite significant imp-
rovements  in  screening  and  treatment  technologies  for 
gastric cancer, it remains the second most common cause of 
cancer-related deaths [1]. An accurate biomarker for detec-
tion of gastric cancer may reduce the cancer-related mor-
tality.  Although  conventional  strategies  for  blood-based 
biomarker discovery have shown promise, the development 
of clinically validated cancer detection markers remains an 
unmet challenge for many common human cancers [2]. New 
approaches that can complement and improve on current 
strategies for cancer detection are urgently needed.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a subset of non-coding RNA 
molecules (approximately 22 nucleotide in length) [3] that 

negatively regulate the protein expression of specific mRNAs 
by  imperfectly  base  pairing  together,  resulting  in  protein 
translational  repression  of  the  target  gene  [4].  Growing 
evidence has shown that miRNAs are involved in a variety of 
biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, 
and apoptosis [5-7]. Studies of miRNAs have been extended 
to many kinds of tumors [8] because altered expression of 
miRNAs has been demonstrated to play an important role in 
carcinogenesis, either by oncogenic [9, 10] or tumor supp-
ressor functions [11, 12]. 

For  example,  three  miRNAs  (miR-21,  miR-27a,  and 
miR-155) have been reported as oncogenic miRNAs. MiR- 
21, the most commonly up-regulated miRNA in both solid 
and  hematological  tumor  tissues  [8,  13],  directly  targets 
tumor  suppressors  such  as  PTEN  phosphatase,  actin- 
binding  protein  tropomyosin  I  and  reversion-inducing- 
cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motif [9, 14, 15]. MiR-27a is

instruction. Total RNA from tissue samples was extracted 
with the miRNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 
and finally eluted into 80 μL of elution solution according to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  The total  RNAs  isolated 
from plasma and tissues were stored at −80oC until further 
use.

miRNA quantification in plasma

The  miR-21,  miR-27a,  and  miR-155  expression  levels 
were  measured  by  using  the  TaqMan  qRT-PCR  analysis 
system  (Applied  Biosystem,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA).  The 
expression  level  of  each  miRNA  was  normalized  to 
U6snRNA. In brief, this assay entailed a 2-step qRT-PCR of 
miRNA of 19−25 nucleotides, priming with a stem-loop 
primer  onto  a  longer  cDNA  that  is  amenable  to  ampli-
fication,  and  quantification  by  a  TaqMan-based  real-time 
PCR. Ct was the number of cycles at which the fluorescence 
signal passed the appropriate threshold. Expression levels 
were determined by using the delta Ct (ΔCt) method, where 
Ct represents the number of cycles in which the fluorescence 
signal passed the appropriate threshold.

miRNA quantification in tissue 

For the detection of miRNA, 2 μg of total RNA extracted 
from  tissues  was  reverse  transcribed  into  cDNA  using 
M-MLV (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) with miRNA-specific 
stem-loop primers, as previously described [16]. The cDNA 
was  used  for  the  amplification  of  mature  miR-27a  and 
endogenous  control  (U6snRNA)  by  real-time  PCR.  The 
real-time PCR was performed by using the SYBR Green PCR 
Mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with a CFX96 real-time 
PCR  system  (Bio-Rad).  The  PCR  cycles  were  as  follows: 
initial denaturation at 95oC for 0.5 min, followed by 40 cycles 
at 94oC for 0.5 min, 56oC for 1 min, 72oC for 0.5 min. The 
relative miRNA expression level was calculated using the 
delta Ct (ΔCt) method. 

Statistical analysis

The  significance  of  miRNA  expression  level  difference 
between patients with gastric cancer and cancer-free control 
subjects was analyzed using Student’s t-test. Determination 
of  the  receiver-operator  characteristic  (ROC),  and  the 
respective area under the ROC curve (AUC), and Kaplan- 
Meier survival analysis were performed using the R software 
(version 2.6.1). Results with a p-value of less than 0.05 were 
considered significant. 

an oncogenic miRNA in gastric adenocarcinoma, targeting 
prohibition  [16],  and  genetic  variant  of  miR-27a  is  asso-
ciated  with  its  expression  and  increased  risk  of  various 
cancer  [17-19].  MiR-155  is  frequently  overexpressed  in 
many cancer tissues and targets tumor protein p53 inducible 
nuclear protein 1 and FOXO3a [20, 21].

Previously,  studies  revealed  that  tumor-associated 
miRNAs  are  present  in  human  plasma  and  serum  in  a 
remarkably stable form that is protected from endogenous 
RNase activity [22, 23], and can be readily detected in these 
blood fluids [24-26]. In addition, it was demonstrated that 
the oncogenic miRNA expression levels in plasma and saliva 
were  decreased  in  cancer  patients  post-surgery  [27-30]. 
These findings suggest that miRNAs have the potential to be 
useful diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for cancer detection. 
In this study, we evaluated the expression levels of these 
three miRNA variants in plasma samples from a screening 
cohort  of  15  patients  with  gastric  cancer  and  15  healthy 
controls  in  Korean  population.  The  significant  miR-27a 
expression  levels  found  were  further  validated  in  an 
additional 73 paired gastric cancer tissues and 70 plasma 
samples  from  Korean  population,  using  quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 

Methods
Plasma and tissue samples 

The plasma and tissue samples (including matched non- 
tumor  tissues)  from  patients  with  gastric  cancer  were 
retrieved from the Chungnam National University Hospital, 
Republic of Korea. All patients gave their written consent 
prior  to  sample  collection.  The  acquisition  of  clinical 
material was approved by the local institution review board. 
These  plasma  samples  were  drawn  from  35  patients  (18 
men,  17  women)  with  gastric  neoplasm  and  35  control 
individuals (18 men, 17 women) without neoplastic disease. 
There  was  no  significant  difference  in  age  between  the 
neoplastic  group  (51.80  ±  11.88  years)  and  the  control 
group (48.94 ± 11.86 years) (Supplementary Table 1). The 
demographic characteristics of the subjects who provided 
the  73  paired  tissue  samples  are  summarized  in  Supp-
lementary Table 2.

Total RNA extraction from fresh tissues and plasma 

Venous blood from all subjects was collected into sterile 
ethylenediamine  tetracetic  aci-coated  vials.  Within  1  h, 
samples  were  centrifuged  (2,000  ×g,  10  min),  following 
which the plasma was removed, aliquoted, and stored at 
—80oC until isolation of the circulating RNA. Total RNA was 
isolated from 300 μL of plasma using the Ambion PARIS Kit 
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s

Results
miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155 expression levels in 
screening cohort

To select potential miRNAs for gastric cancer detection, 
we divided our samples into the 30 screening cohort and 40 
validation cohort. The expression levels of three well-known 
oncogenic miRNAs were evaluated in 30 plasma samples 
consisting of 15 patients with gastric cancer and 15 healthy 
controls. Box plots for the quantitative fluorogenic real-time 
PCR values are shown in Fig. 1. The miR-21 and miR-155 
expression levels were not significantly different between 
the neoplastic group and the control (p = 0.08 and p = 0.27) 

(Fig. 1A and 1C). However, the plasma miR-27a expression 
levels were significantly higher in the patients with gastric 
cancer (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1B). Although miR-21 expression 
level  in  plasma  was  tend  to  be  increased  in  patient  with 
gastric cancer compared to healthy control (p = 0.08), we 
selected miR-27a as a high priority for further analysis.

miR-27a expression level in paired tissue samples

We examined the miR-27a expression level in 73 paired 
gastric cancer tissues to confirm the oncogenic expression of 
this  miRNA  variant.  The  miR-27a  expression  level  was 
elevated  2.8-fold  in  gastric  cancer  tissues  compared  with 
non-tumor tissues (p = 1.96e-06) (Fig. 2A), and this miRNA

was highly expressed in 61 out of 73 gastric cancer patient 
samples (80%). The miR-27a expression levels were highly 
elevated in all stages compared with non-tumor tissues (Fig. 
2B).  We  divided  the  patient  samples  into  diffuse  and 
intestinal types, based on the Lauren classification, because 
gastric cancer patients with diffuse-type tumors have a much 
poorer prognosis than those with the intestinal type. We 
observed  that  the  miR-27a  expression  levels  were  not 
significantly different between intestinal and diffuse types 
(p = 0.19; data not shown). By ROC analysis, we observed 
that the optimal cut-off value for discriminating between 
patients and healthy individuals was 0.0067 for a miR-27a 
expression. miR-27a had 73% sensitivity and 62% specificity 
in discriminating gastric cancer (Fig. 2C). Importantly, we 
observed a significant association between miR-27a overex-
pression and poor survival (p = 0.03) (Fig. 2D), suggesting 
that miR-27a has potential to be used as a prognostic marker 
for patients with gastric cancer. Taken together, the miR-27a 
expression pattern resembled that of an oncogenic microRNA 
and was associated with gastric cancer patient survival. 

MiR-27a expression level in validation cohort

To further validate the diagnostic value of miR-27a, its 
expression level was measured in additional plasma samples 
drawn from 20 patients with gastric cancer and 20 healthy 
controls. The result of miR-27a expression data obtained 
from each 15 patients with gastric cancer and healthy control 
plasma samples used in screening cohort were also included 
in the validation cohort, because of limited sample size. The 
qRT-PCR results revealed that the miR-27a expression level 
was highly elevated in the neoplastic group (p = 0.009) (Fig. 
3A). In both early (I and II) and late stages (III and IV), the 
miR-27a expression levels were significantly higher in the 
group with gastric cancer (Fig. 3B). By ROC analysis, we 
observed the AUC value to be 0.70 with 75% sensitivity and 
56% specificity in discriminating gastric cancer based on the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  3,  2015

cut-off value of 0.031 for miR-27a expression level in plasma 
(Fig.  3C).  Our  results  suggest  that  the  plasma  miR-27a 
expression  level  may  have  potential  as  a  non-invasive 
diagnostic biomarker for gastric cancer.

Discussion

A diagnostic source that would provide high specificity 
and  sensitivity  may  be  of  enormous  benefit  to  cancer 
patients, particularly if the biosource could be obtained from 
non-invasive materials. It was demonstrated that miRNAs 
are involved in multiple steps of carcinogenesis, either by 
oncogenic  or  tumor  suppressor  functions  [31],  and 
circulating miRNAs exist in the serum or plasma [29, 32, 
33].  More  importantly,  miRNAs  have  been  detected  in 
human serum and plasma in stable forms because of their 
short  hairpin  structures,  encapsulation  by  microvesicles, 
and  association  with  protein  complexes  [22,  23,  34,  35]. 
Thus,  the  detection  of  any  altered  expression  of  tumor- 
specific miRNAs in saliva, serum, plasma, and urine may 
offer a promising approach for non-invasive gastric cancer 
detection.

In  this  study,  the  plasma  expression  levels  of  three 
miRNAs (miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-155) were measured 
in  a  screening  cohort,  and  we  observed  that  miR-27a 
expression  was  significantly  elevated  in  gastric  cancer 
samples compared with healthy control samples. Our result 
is  similar  to  previously  reported  results  [36].  Next,  we 
investigated  whether  plasma  miR-27a  could  be  released 
from gastric tumor tissues. We observed that the miR-27a 
expression level was similar between gastric tumor tissues 
and plasma, suggesting that the plasma miR-27a expression 
level may reflect that of the gastric tumor tissues. 

miR-27a is located on chromosome 19, and has oncogenic 
function in gastric adenocarcinoma, by targeting prohibition 
[16]. This miRNA variant is associated with lymph node

metastasis and is overexpressed in gastric cancer [17]. In 
addition, miR-27a can regulate tumor suppress genes such 
as  SPRY2,  and  FBW7  [37,  38].  SPRY2  can  inhibit  tumor 
growth  and  metastases  by  interfering  with  Ras/MAPK 
activation [37], and FBW7 acts as the substrate recognition 
component of a Skp1-Cul1-F-box-protein ubiquitin ligase 
that targets numerous oncoproteins for proteasomal degra-
dation [38]. Growing evidence has suggested that miR-27a 
has  an  important  role  in  gastric  cancer  development  and 
progression. 

To estimate its potential value for gastric cancer detection, 
we  evaluated  the  plasma  miR-27a  expression  level  in  a 
validation  cohort  consisting  of  35  patients  with  gastric 
cancer and 35 healthy control samples. The sensitivity for 
the validation cohort was estimated as 75% and the speci-
ficity  as  56%.  Current  diagnostic  tools  for  gastric  cancer, 
such as the serological markers carbohydrate antigen 19-9 
and  carcinoembryonic  antigen  have  low  specificity  and 
sensitivity [36]. Our data indicates that the sensitivity and 
specificity  of  plasma  miR-27a  are  better  than  that  of  the 
serological markers, although plasma miR-27a alone is not 
sufficient for accurate gastric cancer detection. Thus, real 
improvement in the accuracy of gastric cancer detection still 
needs to be achieved by recruiting additional plasma miRNA 
markers. 

In  conclusion,  plasma  miR-27a  could  be  a  useful  non- 
invasive biomarker for gastric cancer detection. Additional 
studies using a large cohort of samples are needed to validate 
these results because our study had a small sample size.
