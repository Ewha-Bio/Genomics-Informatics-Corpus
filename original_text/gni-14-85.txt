Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems. Although the 
etiology of SLE remains unclear, it is widely accepted that genetic factors could be involved in its pathogenesis. A number of 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the 
risk of SLE in diverse populations. However, not all the SNP candidates identified from non-Asian populations have been 
validated in Koreans. In this study, we aimed to replicate the SNPs that were recently discovered in the GWAS; these SNPs 
have not been validated in Koreans or have only been replicated in Koreans with an insufficient sample size to conclude any 
association. For this, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A and rs2286672 in PLD2, rs887369 in CXorf21, rs9782955 
in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1). Through the replication study with 656 cases and 622 controls, rs1801274 in FCGR2A 
was found to be significantly associated with SLE in Koreans (odds ratio, 1.26, 95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 1.50; p = 
0.01 in allelic model). This association was also significant in two other models (dominant and recessive). The other four SNPs 
did not show a significant association. Our data support that FCGR polymorphisms play important roles in the susceptibility 
to SLE in diverse populations, including Koreans.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic hete-
rogeneous  systemic  autoimmune  disease  that  can,  in 
principle, affect any kind of body organ or cell, primarily in 
young women [1]. In SLE, altered immune responses may 
stimulate  the  production  of  autoantibodies  and  immune 
complex deposits in body organs, resulting in organ damage 
[2]. Like other autoimmune diseases, SLE has a complex 
pathogenesis, and the disease mechanism is still unclear; 
however, it is widely accepted that genetic factors could be 
important contributors to SLE [2, 3]. Accordingly, several 
lines of evidence have supported that SLE may be explained 
by genetic factors. For instance, the concordance rate of SLE 
in monozygotic twins (24% to 58%) is higher than the rate 
in dizygotic twins (2% to 5%), and also, the disease heri-
tability is high (＞66%) [4-6]. 

A number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) 

have  identified  novel  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  associated  with  the  risk  of  SLE,  such  as  HLA, 
PTPN22, STAT4, IRF5, TNFAIP3, BLK, and BANK1, in various 
ethnic groups, but most of the GWASs have been performed 
in Caucasians [1, 7-13]. In Korea, most of the previously 
reported SNPs were validated by GWASs, and potentially 
East Asian-specific SNPs, such as the SNPs in ETS1, IKZF1, 
and SLC15A4, were also identified [14-16]. Recently, Bentham 
et al. [12] performed a large-scale GWAS with 7,219 cases 
and 15,991 controls in Europeans and defined 43 SLE loci, 
including 10 new loci. 

Among  the SLE-associated  loci in  Bentham  et  al.  [12], 
some  of  them  have  not  been  replicated  in  the  Korean 
population, and others were replicated but not concluded to 
be associated due to a limited sample size. In this study, we 
aimed  to  replicate  five  SNPs  that  were  not  replicated  or 
concluded to be association in Koreans.

Methods
Study subjects

All participants were of Korean ancestry. For the repli-
cation study, 656 SLE patients (males, 11; females, 645; age 
[mean ± SD], 33.7 ± 12.1 years) were recruited from the 
Rheumatology Center at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, The Ca-
tholic  University  of  Korea,  South  Korea.  All  patients  had 
been diagnosed as having SLE according to the American 
College of Rheumatology-revised criteria for SLE [17, 18]. In 
addition, the allele frequencies for healthy Korean popul-
ation  as  control  were  derived  from  the  Korea  Reference 
Genome  Database  (n=622).  This  study  was  performed 
under  the  approval  of  our  institutional  review  board 
(MC12TIMI0026).

SNP genotyping

In this study, we selected five SNPs (rs1801274 in FCGR2A 
locus, rs2286672 in PLD2 locus, rs887369 in CXorf21 locus, 
rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) that were 
identified to be associated with SLE from a previous GWAS 
[12] but have not been tested in a Korean population. Five 
SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping 
Assay (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for allelic 
discrimination.  TaqMan  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR) 
and  fluorescence  measurements  were  performed  using  a 
ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using a 
384-well plate according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis

Chi-square  test  was  used  to  estimate  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium with the genotype data of the SLE cases and 
controls.  Significant  differences  in  alleles  and  genotype 
frequencies between cases and controls were assessed using 
SPSS  version  22  (IBM  Corp.,  Armonk,  NY,  USA).  Odds 
ratios (ORs) were calculated by case and control allele frequ-
encies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The p-values 
＜0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.

Results
Candidate SNP selection

Of the 43 SLE-associated loci identified by Bentham et al. 
[12], we narrowed down the candidate SNPs for this study 
per the following criteria: SNPs that had not been replicated 
in the Korean population, SNPs with a minor allele frequency 
above 5% in an East Asian population, and SNPs that were 
replicated in the Korean population but inconclusive owing 
to the limited sample size. Seven of the 43 SNPs were not 
replicated in the Korean population, and five of them showed 
a  minor  allele  frequency  above  5%  in  the  East  Asian 
population (Supplementary Table 1). Therefore, we selected 
the five SNPs for a replication study in Koreans (rs1801274 
in  FCGR2A  locus, rs2286672  in  PLD2  locus, rs887369  in 
CXorf21  locus,  rs9782955  in  LYST,  and  rs3794060  in 
NADSYN1) (Table 1). Three of them were nonsynonymous,

and the other two were intronic SNPs. 

Association with SLE

A total of 656 cases and 622 controls were enrolled and 
genotyped to analyze the association with SLE. Minor allele 
frequencies of the five SNPs in this study were similar to 
those in East Asians from 1000 Genomes Database (Table 2) 
[19],  suggesting  that  this  study  group  can  represent  the 
Korean population and that our genotyping was reliable. We 
performed  an  association  analysis  with  three  different 
genetic models: allelic, dominant, and recessive (Table 3). 
Of the five SNPs, rs1801274 in FCGR2A was significantly 
associated with the risk of SLE in all three models, but the 
other  four  SNPs  did  not  show  a  significant  association. 
Under allelic model, the minor allele frequency of genotype 
G in rs1801274 was significantly higher in SLE patients (AF = 
0.285) than in controls (AF = 0.24) (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06 
to 1.50; p = 0.01). Also, the dominant model of minor allele 
in rs1801274 seems significantly associated with SLE (OR, 
1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.59; p = 0.03). Under recessive model, 
the genotype G/G of rs1801274 was significantly associated 
with SLE (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.39; p = 0.046).

Discussion

SLE is a complex autoimmune disease caused by complex 
interactions between genetic and environmental components 
[4, 20]. Its high heritability and relatively higher risks in 
siblings suggest a genetic contribution to the risk of SLE [21, 
22]. In this study, we aimed to replicate five SNPs that were 
discovered in Caucasians [12] but not replicated in Koreans 

(rs2286672  in  PLD2  locus,  rs887369  in  CXorf21  locus, 
rs9782955 in LYST, and rs3794060 in NADSYN1) or replicated 
in Koreans (rs1801274 in FCGR2A locus) with insufficient 
sample size to conclude any association. Through a replication 
study  with  656  cases  and  622  controls,  rs1801274  in 
FCGR2A was found to be significantly associated with SLE in 
Koreans. However, the other four candidate SNPs were not 
replicated in Koreans.

The risk allele (G) of rs1801274 in FCGR2A is a missense 
variant that changes a histidine to arginine [23]. The human 
Fcγ receptor (FCGR) gene family (FCGR2A, FCGR2B, and 
FCGR2C) is located on chromosome 1q23, and it is consi-
dered to be associated with the susceptibility to SLE [23, 24]. 
Functionally, human Fcγ receptor is involved in anti-infla-
mmatory regulation of immune responses. Another important 
role  of  human  Fcγ receptor  is  the  clearance  of  immune 
complexes [25]. Indeed, FCGR polymorphisms have been 
reported to be associated with the susceptibility to auto-
immune  diseases,  including  SLE  [26-28].  A  well-known 
polymorphism is the missense variant at amino acid 131 in 
FCGR2A, which decreases binding affinity to human immu-
noglobulin G [23, 28, 29]. The homozygosity for R131, being 
regarded as the low-binding allele of FCGR2A, is known to be 
associated with a 1.30-fold greater risk for the development 
of SLE compared with both of the other genotypes combined 
[30, 31]. Thus, FCGR2A-R131 may have potential roles in 
causing defective immune complex clearance and increased 
tissue  deposition,  thereby  leading  to  accelerated  organ 
damage [30, 32]. FCGR2A on phagocytic cells is a receptor 
for C-reactive protein (CRP) and the serum amyloid P (SAP) 
component,  both  acting  as  opsonins  for  nuclear  antigens

[33, 34], and the binding between receptor and CRP or SAP 
might be influenced by polymorphisms [30, 35], because 
there  is  a  dose-response  characteristic  between  FCGR-
2A-R/H131 and the risk of SLE, with an escalation of SLE 
risk between RR homozygotes and RH heterozygotes [30-32]. 
Vigato-Ferreira et al. [27] examined the allelic distribution of 
FCGR2A  in  a  Brazilian  population  (157  SLEs  and  160 
controls). They found that two polymorphisms of FCGR2A 
were  associated  with  SLE  (FCGR2A-R-131  and  RR-131), 
noting that the FCGR2A-H-131 allele was associated with the 
susceptibility to arthritis and anti-DNA antibodies [27]. In the 
meta-analysis performed by Li et al. [28], the FCGR2A-R/H131 
variant  was  associated  with  the  development  of  SLE  in 
Asians  both  at  the  allele  and  genotype  level.  Low  copy 
number of FCGR genes, including FCGR2A-RR-131, FCGR3B, 
and the 2B.4 haplotype of FCGR2B, has also been reported to 
be  associated  with  the  susceptibility  to  SLE  [26].  Other 
studies also reported the association between FCGR2A and 
SLE nephritis in the Korean population [36-39], demonst-
rating that the FCGR2A H131R missense variation is pre-
sented as a risk allele of SLE and SLE nephritis. However, the 
association  was  hard  to  conclude  because  of  the  lack  of 
power due to the limited small sample size (73 to 300 pa-
tients).

In conclusion, in this study, we performed a replication 
study of five SNPs, previously known to be associated with 
SLE but not replicated in Koreans, with a relatively large 
amount of samples, demonstrating that rs1801274 in FCGR2A 
shows a nominally significant association with SLE, but the 
other four SNPs appear to have no association in the Korean 
population. Our result is supportive that FCGR polymorphisms 
may  play  important  roles  in  the  susceptibility  to  SLE  in 
diverse populations, including Koreans.
