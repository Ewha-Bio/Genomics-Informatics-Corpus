With the success of the genome-wide association studies (GWASs), many candidate loci for complex human diseases have 
been reported in the GWAS catalog. Recently, many disease prediction models based on penalized regression or statistical 
learning  methods  were  proposed  using  candidate  causal  variants  from  significant  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  of 
GWASs.  However,  there  have  been  only  a  few  systematic  studies  comparing  existing  methods.  In  this  study,  we  first 
constructed risk prediction models, such as stepwise linear regression (SLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator 
(LASSO),  and  Elastic-Net  (EN),  using  a  GWAS  chip  and  GWAS  catalog.  We  then  compared  the  prediction  accuracy  by 
calculating the mean square error (MSE) value on data from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) with body mass index.  
Our results show that SLR provides a smaller MSE value than the other methods, while the numbers of selected variables in 
each model were similar.

Introduction

With the development of genotyping technologies, many 
disease-related  genetic  variants  have  been  verified  by 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Diagnosis and 
disease risk prediction from the utilization of the genetic 
variants have improved even further [1]. Direct-to-consumer 
genetic companies, such as 23andME (http://www.23andme. 
com/) and Pathway Genomics (https://www.pathway.com/), 
provide personal genome information services. For example, 
the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes play important roles in breast 
cancer diagnosis and clinical treatment [2, 3]. While several 
disease  prediction  studies  have  been  conducted  using 
disease-related genetic variants, there are some limitations 
to disease risk prediction. It becomes difficult to construct a 
disease risk prediction model, because there are typically a 
larger  number  of  genetic  variants  than  the  number  of 
individuals in the “large p small n” problem. Also, the effect 
size of genetic variants for most complex human diseases is 

small, and missing heritability exists [4]. Moreover, some 
loss of statistical power to identify significant associations is 
caused by the correlating single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) [5]. Multicolli-
nearity due to high LD among SNPs causes high variance of 
coefficient estimates. In order to solve these issues, various 
statistical approaches have been recently proposed.

Initially, a gene score (GS) was computed using statistical 
models for disease risk prediction [6-8]. These risk predic-
tion  models  were  created  from  GSs  by  summing  up  the 
marginal effect of each disease-associated genetic variant. 
Several  studies  have  shown  that  GS  is  useful  for  risk 
prediction [9]. However, the accuracy of the risk prediction 
is poor when joint effects exist between multiple genetic 
variants [10, 11].

Building a risk prediction model using multiple SNPs is an 
effective way to improve disease risk prediction. Multiple 
logistic regression (MLR) is one of the typical traditional 
approaches. Several studies have shown the usefulness of an 
MLR-based  approach  for  creating  disease  risk  prediction

models [12-14]. However, the parameter estimation of MLR 
becomes  unstable,  and  the  predictive  power  of  the  risk 
prediction model decreases if there is high LD among SNPs.
In order to solve the “large p and small n” problem, many 
penalized  regression  approaches,  like  ridge  [15-17],  least 
absolute  shrinkage  and  selection  operator  (LASSO)  [18], 
and Elastic-Net (EN) [19], have been proposed. For high- 
dimensional data, these penalized approaches have several 
advantages in variable selection, as well as in prediction, over 
non-penalized approaches. For example, several researchers 
showed that the utilization of a large amount of SNPs with 
penalized regression approaches improves the accuracy of 
Crohn’s disease and bipolar disorder risk prediction [20, 21].
It  is  important  to  build  a  risk  prediction  model  that 
pertains to discrete variables, such as disease diagnosis. It is 
also  important  to  make  predictions  based  on  continuous 
variables, such as human health-related outcomes. When 
using medicines to treat diseases, we can use genetic infor-
mation to calculate the dosage, in addition to basic physical 
information, such as height and weight. For example, there 
is a prediction model for warfarin responsiveness that was 
made with multivariate linear regression [22]. We can apply 
such a model directly to disease treatment.

In this study, we focus on the prediction of quantitative 
traits  using  common  genetic  variants.  We  systematically

first  selected  the  prediction  variables  using  statistical 
methods, such as stepwise linear regression (SLR), LASSO,

tion models, such as SLR, LASSO, and EN. Finally, we com-
pared the predictive accuracy by calculating the mean square 
error (MSE) value for predicting body mass index (BMI). 
Overall, our results show that LASSO and SLR provide the 
smallest MSE value among the compared methods.

Methods
Data

The KARE project, which began in 2007, is an Anseong 
and Ansan regional society-based cohort. After applying SNP 
quality control criteria—Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p ＜ 
−06, genotype call rates ＜ 95%, and minor allele frequency 
10
＜ 0.01—352,228 SNPs were utilized for analysis. Also, after 
eliminating 401 samples with call rates less than 96%, 11 
contaminated samples, 41 gender-inconsistent samples, 101 
serious  concomitant  illness  samples,  608  cryptic-related 
samples,  and  4  samples  with  missing  phenotype,  8,838 
participants  were  analyzed  [23].  Table  1  summarizes  the 
demographic  information.  In  addition,  Fig.  1  shows  box 
plots of BMI for the given demographic variables. 

Statistical analysis

We selected SNPs from the KARE data analysis based on 
single-SNP analysis and collected SNPs in the GWAS catalog 
[24]. Then, we performed two steps to make quantitative 
prediction models. First, we selected the variables by using 
SLR, LASSO, and EN and then built quantitative prediction 
models by using the same methods.

SNP sets
First, based on three different populations—overall popu-
lation, Asian-only population, and Korean-only population
—we collected the SNPs registered in the GWAS catalog for 
BMI. Second, the SNPs were selected by single-SNP analysis 
using linear regression with adjustments for sex, age, and 
area. We chose the SNPs based on the p-values. We con-
sidered the following seven SNP sets:

(1) ASIAN-100  (GWAS  catalog  [Asia]  ＋ Single-SNP 

analysis, number of SNPs = 100)

(2) KOREAN-100 (GWAS catalog [Korea] ＋ single-SNP 

analysis, number of SNPs = 100)

(3) ALL-200 (GWAS catalog [All] ＋ single-SNP analysis, 

number of SNPs = 200)

(4) ASIAN-200  (GWAS  catalog  [Asia]  ＋ single-SNP 

analysis, number of SNPs = 200)

(5) KOREAN-200 (GWAS catalog [Korea] ＋ single-SNP 

analysis, number of SNPs = 200)

(6) GWAS-ALL (GWAS catalog [All], number of SNPs = 

136) 

(7) GWAS-ASIAN  (GWAS  catalog  [Asia],  number  of 

SNPs = 16)

Step 1: Variable selection
In the KARE data, out of 8,838 individuals, we randomly 
selected 1,767 for test sets and composed the training set 
with the rest of the 7,071 participants. We selected SNPs

using 5-fold cross-validation (CV) of the training set. In this 
case, we used SLR, LASSO, and EN to select SNPs.

The SLR model is one of the most widely used models. Let 
yi be a quantitative phenotype for subject i = 1, …, n; xij be the 
value of SNP j = 1, …, p for subject i; code be 0, 1, and 2 for 
the number of minor alleles; and εi be the error term for 
subject i. The SLR model is 

yi = β0 ＋ β1xi1 ＋ ... ＋ βpxip ＋ γ1sexi ＋ γ2agei ＋ γ3areai 

＋ εi,

where β0 and βj are the intercept and effect sizes of SNPs, 
respectively. γ1, γ2, and γ3 represent the sex, age, and area 
of  the  i-th  individual,  respectively.  Variable  selection  was 
performed  by  a  MSE-based  stepwise  procedure.  The 
stepwise  procedure  was  performed  using  the  R  package 
“MASS” [25].

respectively.  The  tuning  parameters  λ1  and  λ2  are 
estimated using CV. The penalized methods were performed 
using the R package “glmnet” [26].

Then, we defined five groups.

time in the 5-fold CV)

two times in the 5-fold CV)

Step 2: Quantitative prediction
To  build  a  quantitative  prediction  model,  we  used  the 
same prediction methods that were applied for the variable 
selection step for the comparison of these three methods in 
the  variable  selection  and  quantitative  prediction.  Each 
prediction  model  was  created  by  using  7,071  training 
individuals via 5-fold CV. To compare the performance of the 
quantitative prediction models, we calculated the MSE by 
applying each quantitative prediction model using the test 
set (n = 1,767).

Results

To create the SNP sets associated with BMI, single-SNP 
analysis  was  performed  by  linear  regression  with  adjust-
ments for sex, age, and area. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 
1, we found one significant SNP (rs17178527) after Bonferroni 
−07). rs17178527 of LOC729076 has 
correction (1.45 × 10
been reported as BMI-associated SNP in previous GWASs 
[23,  27].  In  addition,  Supplementary  Table  1  shows  the 
results of the single-SNP analysis with p-values less than 
−05. The SNPs that were reported to be associated 
5.00 × 10
with  BMI  in  the  GWAS  catalog  are  summarized  in 
Supplementary Table 2. Seven SNP sets are summarized in 

Table 2.

Step 1: Variable selection

Variable  selection  in  each  SNP  set  was  performed  via 
5-fold CV of the training set. Fig. 2 shows the overlapping 
number of selected SNPs by the variable selection methods. 
In  addition,  Table  3  provides  more  detailed  information. 
Overall, SLR selected fewer SNPs than LASSO and EN. All 
SNPs  were  selected  when  EN  was  used  in  ASIAN-100, 
ASIAN-200, and KOREAN-200.

Step 2: Quantitative prediction

We made quantitative prediction models based on SLR, 
LASSO, and EN using the entire training dataset. Then, the 
MSE was calculated by applying the quantitative prediction 
models  to  the  test  dataset.  Table  4  and  Fig.  3  show  the 
performance of each quantitative prediction model in the 
test dataset. The model using only covariates yielded an MSE 
value of 10.24. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the prediction 
model created from Group 5 yielded the smallest MSE. Fig. 
4 describes the comparison results between the numbers of 
SNPs and MSEs from the prediction models using SLR.

Among  all  sets,  the  case  that  used  LASSO  to  select 
variables and SLR to create the model showed the smallest 
MSE value of 9.64 in ASIAN-100, with 51 SNPs. Among the 
51 SNPs of LASSO-SLR with one set from ASIAN-100, 28 
SNPs were mapped to genes (Table 5). Some genes, such as 
FTO, GP2, AKAP6, ANKS1B, ADCY3, and ADCY8, have been 
reported to be associated with BMI [28-33].

Discussion

In this study, we used statistical methods (SLR, LASSO, 
and EN) to select variables and build quantitative prediction 
models. Then, we compared the performance of the quanti-
tative  prediction  models  by  each  SNP  set  (ASIAN-100, 
KOREAN-100, ALL-200, ASIAN-200, KOREAN-200, GWAS- 
ALL, and GWAS-ASIAN). As a result, the performance of the 
prediction models using the GWAS catalog and KARE data 
was better than that of the prediction models using only 
SNPs  reported  in  the  GWAS  catalog.  For  the  case  that 
selected variants using LASSO in ASIAN-100 and created a 
prediction model using SLR, the MSE value was the smallest, 
9.64. At this time, the number of SNPs was 51. Also, for the 
model with the fewest SNPs, we selected variables using SLR 
from ALL-200 and created a model using SLR. The number 
of SNPs was 38, and the MSE value was 9.84. Through the 
5-fold  CV,  we  developed a  quantitative  prediction model. 
After calculating MSE from groups 1 to 5, when assembled 
with SNPs that were included in all CVs, the resulting values 
of MSE were small. However, when a different group was

used,  the  MSE  value  was  bigger  than  when  using  the 
covariates  to  build  the  model.  Therefore,  with  CV,  when 
using SNPs that match each of their CVs, the efficiency of 
their quantitative prediction model was high. In the variable 
selection, SLR performed better than other methods. SLR 
selected fewer SNPs than the other methods in all SNP sets 
while providing smaller MSEs. It seems that LASSO and EN 
tended to select SNPs with little contribution to BMI. For 
further research, we plan to perform simulation studies and 
a real-data analysis with other continuous traits.

There are many ways to extend the analysis of quantitative 
prediction  studies.  First,  along  with  the  application  of 
recently developed methods, such as bootstrapping methods 
[34, 35], we will continue to explore new ways to develop 
more prediction models. Second, the incorporation of rare 
variants  can  improve  the  performance  of  a  quantitative 
prediction  model.  Advanced  sequencing  technology  has 
made it possible to investigate the role of common and rare 
variants in complex disease risk prediction. Additionally, we 
can use biological information while choosing the variables. 
By using single-SNP analysis, we can use gene or pathway 

information to find useful SNPs [36], and from here, we can 
assemble  an  SNP  set  by  adding  an  SNP  list  from  the 
pathways related to the disease of interest.
