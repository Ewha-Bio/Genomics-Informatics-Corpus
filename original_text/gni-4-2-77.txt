Abstract 
In order to identify novel proapoptotic genes, we screened 
approximately 1 ,000 hypothetical genes whose functions 
are completely unknown.  After these genes were tran(cid:173)
siently expressed in Hela cells, their nuclei images were 
captured using automated high-speed fluorescence mi(cid:173)
croscope, through which the ratio of apoptotic nuclei was 
estimated.  We selected genes that induce greater than 
3-fold increase in apoptotic nuclei compared to that of the 
vector control.  The candidate proapoptotic genes were 
sequenced  and  their effects on  cell  death were further 
confirmed  by  the  additional  assay,  DNA fragmentation 
ELISA. Finally, we were able to identify 4 full-length hypo(cid:173)
thetical genes with proapoptotic activity.

Introduction 
Human  tumors  are  developed  from  the  normal  cell 
through multistep genetic and epigenetic alterations that 
confer  growth  advantage  (Hanahan  and  Weinberg, 
2000).  The typical features sharing among cancer cells 
are the self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to 
growth-inhibitory  signals,  evasion  of  programmed  cell 
death,  limitless  replicative  potential,  sustained  angio(cid:173)
genesis,  and tissue invasion and  metastasis (Hanahan 
and Weinberg,  2000). 

In contrast, tumor suppressor gene-like features are as 
the following.  1: They induce cell death or decrease cell 
proliferation, 2: They the expression is usually decreased 
in tumor tissue compared to the normal, 3: They inhibit the

migration or the invasion process, and  4:  upon reduced 
or  removal  of  the  gene  they  exhibit  the  oncogenic 
phenotype  such  as  anchorage-independent  growth 
(Koenig-Hoffmann eta/., 2004). 

Recently,  two novel tumor suppressor genes  PITX1 
(Kolfschoten eta/., 2005) and  REST (Westbrook eta/., 
2005) were identified using RNA interference libraries. In 
addition, by combining high-throughput functional genomics, 
computerized database mining and expression analyses 
revealed a subset of novel genes with tumor suppressor 
phenotypes (Koenig-Hoffmann eta/., 2005). 

As a first step towards identifying novel tumor suppressor 
genes, we screened for genes that induce apoptosis. In this 
study, we used ESTs established from the previous work 
(Kim eta/., 2004). Of these collected cDNAs, approximately 
5,000 full-length genes were subcloned into the mammalian 
expression vector system (Oh  eta/., 2004),  and among 
these, a total of 938 eDNA clones are novel genes whose 
functions are completely unknown. 

Thus, we transiently overexpressed 938 hypothetical 
cDNAs  in  Hela cells,  and  identified  genes that  induce 
apoptosis through automated high-throughput fluorescence 
microscope. After the DNA sequences of the selected genes 
were analyzed, we chose 4 full-length novel genes that do 
not contain  any mutations.  Apoptosis induced by these 
genes  was  further  confirmed  by  the 
independent 
apoptosis assay,  DNA fragmentation  ELISA.  Together, 
we identified 4 novel proapoptotic genes, and their tumor 
suppressor gene-like features were discussed. 

Methods 
eDNA expression plasmids 
Of 7,385 full-length KUGI (Korean UniGene Information; 
http://kugi.kribb.re.kr)  genes,  4,782  genes  are  in  the 
mammalian expression vector system (Kim eta/., 2004; 
Oh eta/., 2004 ). Among these, a total of 938 hypothetical 
eDNA clones were used for the screen. 

Cell culture and transfection conditions 
Hela cells were maintained at 37°C humidified incubator 
containing 5% C02, and grown in DMEM supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (JBI, Korea). 
16-18 hours after approximately 7,500 Hela cells were 
seeded per well of a 96well plate, transfection was carried 
out  using  Lipofectamine  Plus™  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,

Transfection was performed with  1 00 ng eDNA per well 
in  case of a 96-well plate. Transfection of Hela cells in 
the 6-well plate was carried out using 1 fig eDNA 

Nudear fragmentation assay 
28-30 hours after transfection, cells were stained with 5 
11M  Hoechst  33342  (Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR). 
Nuclear morphology was analyzed using the automated 
fluorescence  microscope,  In  Cell  Analyzer  1000  (GE, 
Cardiff, U.K.). After the fluorescence images were taken 
from three fields per well,  the percentage of fragmented 
nuclei was calculated. 

DNA fragmentation ELISA 
Hela cells grown in a 6-well plate were transfected with 
cDNAs  as  described  above,  and  were  harvested  to 
assess  the  extent  of  DNA  fragmentation  using  Cell 
Death  Detection  ELISA  (Roche, 
IN) 
according  to the  manufacturer's recommendation.  The 
cytosolic  fraction  (20,0QQxg)  of  approximately  1x1Q4 
cells  was  incubated  in  the  microtiter  plate  that  was 
coated with the primary anti-histone antibody. After the 
incubation, the secondary anti-DNA antibody coupled to 
peroxidase  was  added.  The  percentage  of  DNA 
fragmentation was compared with  the control  cells that 
were transfected with the vector, pCNS (Oh eta/., 2004).

The in silica tumor suppressor gene-like expression profile 
of novel proapoptotic genes in normal vs. malignant tissue 
was predicted by their frequencies in NCB I EST libraries 
(http://cgap.nci.nih.gov). The ratio (log scale) between in 
silica determined expression in tumor vs.  matched normal 
tissue (negative means reduced in tumor) was estimated. 
To remove artifacts, ESTs from cell lines and normalized 
libraries were excluded. 

Results and Discussion 
Hela cells were used in our screen because these cells are 
propagated  and  expanded  easily  and  are  efficiently 
transfected. Moreover, Hela is a well-known and accepted 

cancer cell line that is frequently used for cancer-related 
studies. 28-30 hours after Hela cells were transfected with 
hypothetical genes, their nuclei were stained with Hoechst. 
Nuclear  images  were  captured  using  automated 
fluorescence  microscope,  IN  Cell  Analyzer  1000. Total 
number of cells was automatically counted by using object 
intensity  module,  and  the  condensed  and  fragmented 
nucleus that is characteristic of apoptosis was counted. 
The fold induction of apoptosis was compared with that of 
Hela cells transfected with the vector as a control. 

After initial  screen,  we carried  out DNA sequencing 
on  genes that  result  in  greater than  3-fold  increase  in 
apoptotic nuclei compared to that of the control. Genes 
that have either mutations or deletions were eliminated. 
Finally,  we  selected  four  full-length  genes,  C7orf11, 
DKFpZ667M2411,  FLJ 12438,  and  FLJ20130 
that 
induce apoptosis (Table 1 ).  The Hoechst stained nuclei 
images of the Hela cells transfected with these 4 genes 
were shown in  Fig.  1A.  In order to confirm the apoptotic 
phenotype  of these  genes,  DNA  fragmentation  assay 
was carried  out.  As shown  in  Fig.  1 B,  the level of DNA

fragmentation  was  enhanced  in  cells  transfected  with 
these  4  candidate  proapoptotic  genes  compared  with 
the cells transfected with the vector control.  Since DNA 
fragmentation is an indicative of apoptosis, these results 
indicate that these genes  induce  apoptosis when  they 
are overexpressed in  Hela cells. 

Of these 4 proapoptotic genes, C? orf11  was recently 
found to be associated with the genetic disease termed 
trichothiodystrophy  (TID)  (Nakabayashi  et at.,  2005), 
however,  its association with either apoptosis or cancer 
has not been reported. Aside from C7orf11, the biological 
function  of the  other 3  genes  has  not  been  published 
previously, except that FLJ12438 is a variant of invasion 
inhibitory gene IIP45 (Song eta/., 2003). 

Our  bioinformatic  analyses  on  in  silica  expression 
profiles  of C7orf11,  DKFpZ667M2411,  FLJ12438,  and 
FLJ20130  are  summarized  in  Table  2.  Expression 
profiles  of these genes  indicate reduced  expression  in 
various  tumors,  especially,  decreased  expression  of 
FLJ12438  in  ovarian  cancer  vs.  normal  ovary  and  of 
FLJ20130  in  pancreas  cancer  vs.  normal  pancreas. 
Together  with  the  results  that  the  overexpression  of 
these genes lead to apoptosis, they can be considered 
as candidate tumor suppressor genes.  Further studies 
are required to address this issue.
