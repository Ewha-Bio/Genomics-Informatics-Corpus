Abstract 
ESTin is an easy-to-use tool that allows EST researchers 
to build a dbEST submission file with EST sequences 
and  related  data.  The  advantages  of  ESTin  are  its 
user-friendly interface,  various  editing  functions,  and 
rigorous validation function.

Expressed  sequence 
is  generated  by 
single-pass !5'  or 3' DNA sequencing of clones randomly 
picked  from  eDNA  libraries  (Adams  et  a/.,  1991).  It 
represents  a  partial  description  of  the  transcribed 
portions of genomes,  and thus can  provide insight into 
transcribed  !~enes in  a  variety  of organisms  (Boguski, 
1995). Most EST sequences are deposited into dbEST, 
a  central  public  EST  repository,  in  order to  obtain  the 
deposition  numbersfor publication  and  supply them  to 
the bio-comrnunity (Boguski  eta/.,  1993). dbEST is the 
largest  division  of  GenBank.  Currently,  it  contains 
38,933,423 emtries that account for sixty-two percent of 
the entire GenBank entries (Benson et at.,  2006). 

To submit EST sequences to dbEST, they should be 
converted  into  EST  submission  files,  according  to  the 
dbEST format (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/how 
to_submit.html), which can be sent to dbEST via email. 
There are four types  of dbEST format:  contact,  library, 
publication,  and  EST.  Each  type  has  its  own  fields

consisting of a capitalized field tag, followed by data. It is 
easy to  make the contact,  library,  and  publication files. 
However,  it  is  a  difficult  job  to  build  an  EST  file, 
becausemost EST projects produce lar9e numbers of EST 
sequences. Although it is possible to prepare them with 
manual editing, this is a tedious task and can cause errors 
in  the  submission  file.  Therefore,  in  most cases,  using 
programs is necessary for preparing EST submission files. 
Although several programs have been developed for 
preparing  EST  submission  files,  most  of  them  are 
integrated  in  large  packages  for  EST  processing  and 
annotation such as ESTAP (Mao et at.,  2003), ESlWeb 
(Paquola eta/., 2003), and PartiGene (Parkinson eta/., 
2004 ).  Accordingly, to use this function, these packages 
and all the pre-required programs should be installed on 
the user's computer, which is an unnecessary job except 
for a package user.  Moreover,  most of these programs 
are capable of building  EST submission files only with 
the EST sequences from their own package's output. 

The  author  has  developed  ESTin,  a  program  for 
building EST submission files to dbEST. The advantages 
of ESTin  are  its  user-friendly interface,  various  editing 
functions,  and a rigorous validating function. 

Methods 
ESTin was written in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and runs on 
PC-compatible computers under the Microsoft Windows 
operating system. Its interface consists of a main window 
and  several  input dialogs.  The  user can  input contact, 
library,  publication,  and  EST  data  by  clicking  on  the 
corresponding buttons in the main window. Figure 1 shows 
the main window and several input dialogs. 

In  preparing  an  EST  submission  file,  the  most 
significant aspect is the EST sequence-s.  ESTin accepts 
FAST A-formatted EST sequences from external files and 
treats  the  first  word  in  the  description  line  of an  EST 
sequence as the EST name. 

Most  ESTs  have  features  that  am  included  in  the 
submission  files.  Some  features  are- common  to  all 
ESTs, such as the Library name, whereas the others are 
unique to each EST such as row and column numbers. 
Users can  assign common features to all  ESTs or to a 
part  of them  during  the  importing  step.  To  assign  the 
unique  features  to  ESTs,  these  features  need  to  be 
converted  to  a  tag=data  form  and  added  them  to  the

Fig.  1.  User interfaces of ESTin.  ESTin interface consists of a main window and  several  input dialogs.  Users can  input Contact, 
Library, Publication, and EST data by clicking on the corresponding buttons in the main window. A) Main window.  B) Contact input 
dialog. C) Library input dialog. D) Publication input dialog. E) EST input dialog, in which users import their sequences from EST files. 

corresponding EST description line with a bar-separated 
format. For example, if an EST has four unique features: 
'EST0001' for name,  'HHC189' for clone,  'M13 forward' 
for primer, and '640' for insert length, its description line 
will be the following: >EST001  ICLONE=HHC1891SEQ_ 
PRIMER= M13 forwardiiNSERT=6401. These descriptions 
are  automatically parsed  and  assigned  into  each  EST 
fields when imported. ESTin also has a function to allow 
users to edit each EST feature as well as its sequences. 
After importing,  ESTin  checks  whether  the  EST  ID  is 
unique and the sequence bases are legal. 

ESTin shows useful  information for EST sequences 
such  as EST statistics  and the same  EST sequences. 
The  statistics  present  mean,  standard  deviation,  and 

length  distribution of all  the  EST sequences.  From the 
statistics  information,  the  user  can  detect  whether 
non-EST sequences were  included,  for example,  host 
genome  sequences  and  vector  sequences  that  are 
generally much  longer than  EST sequences.  The  EST 
name  information  that  havethe  same  sequences  will 
help users identify multiple importing of the same ESTs 
with different names. 

ESTin has a validation function to check whether the 
inputdata is correct against the db EST format. The main 
checking  points  are  field  format,  obligatory fields,  and 
EST references to contact, library, and publication. If an 
error is detected, the user cannot build a submission file. 
Some ESTin functions facilitate building a submission

ESTin can re,ad a dbEST submission file, which may be 
used for  validating  a  submission  file  created  by  other 
programs before submitting it to dbEST. 

Results atnd Discussion 

ESTin is an easy-to-use tool that allows EST researchers 
to build submission files with  EST sequences and their 
related  data.  ESTin's user-friend  editing and validating 
functions will be useful to EST submitters and eventually 
lead to raisin~l the accuracy of dbEST. The ESTin source 
code is available to academic users upon request.
