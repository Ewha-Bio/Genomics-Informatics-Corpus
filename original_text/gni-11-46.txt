Normal-karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) is a highly malignant and cytogenetically heterogeneous hematologic 
cancer. We searched for somatic mutations from 10 pairs of tumor and normal cells by using a highly efficient and reliable 
analysis workflow for whole-exome sequencing data and performed association tests between the NK-AML and somatic 
mutations.  We  identified  21  nonsynonymous  single  nucleotide  variants  (SNVs)  located  in  a  coding  region  of  18  genes. 
Among them, the SNVs of three leukemia-related genes (MUC4, CNTNAP2, and GNAS) reported in previous studies were 
replicated in this study. We conducted stepwise genetic risk score (GRS) models composed of the NK-AML susceptible variants 
and evaluated the prediction accuracy of each GRS model by computing the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve  (AUC).  The  GRS  model  that  was  composed  of  five  SNVs  (rs75156964,  rs56213454,  rs6604516,  rs10888338,  and 
rs2443878) showed 100% prediction accuracy, and the combined effect of the three reported genes was validated in the 
current study (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.00). Further study with large sample sizes is warranted to 
validate  the  combined  effect  of  these  somatic  point  mutations,  and  the  discovery  of  novel  markers  may  provide  an 
opportunity to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for NK-AML.

Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by 
the rapid growth of abnormal myeloid cells in the marrow, is 
a highly malignant and cytogenetically heterogeneous type 
of cancer [1].  AML  is categorized  into three  risk  groups: 
favorable,  intermediate,  and  unfavorable.  AML  with  a 
normal  karyotype  (NK-AML)  accounts  for  approximately 
40% to 50% of adult patients and 25% of pediatric patients 
with AML and is composed of a heterogeneous group with an 
intermediate prognosis [2].

In the past few years, next-generation sequencing tech-
nologies have been developed rapidly in the field of cancer 
genomics  [3,  4]  and  enabled  a  direct  genome-wide  asso-
ciation  test  for  NK-AML  at  single-base  resolution  in  an 
unbiased manner [5]. A comprehensive understanding of 
the  genetic  lesions  is  an  important  basis  for  developing 
personalized therapies for the treatment of NK-AML [6].

Ley  et  al.  [5]  carried  out  the  first  whole-genome 
association  study  for  AML  by  using  single-end  whole- 

genome sequencing data and found 181 single nucleotide 
variations  (SNVs),  including  28  indels,  nonsynonymous, 
and splicing sites (NPM1 and FLT3, respectively). Mardis et 
al. [7] performed paired-end whole-genome sequencing for 
cytogenetically normal AML, found seven nonsynonymous 
SNVs (nsSNVs), one splice site SNV, two indels in coding 
regions, and 52 somatic point mutations in conserved or 
regulatory genomic regions, and observed a 10% recurrence 
rate in the IDH1 mutation in 188 additional AML samples. In 
the following year, Ley et al. [5] carried out a case-control 
study of relapsed AML among patients who were reported in 
2008. They found a one-base-pair deletion in the DNMT3A 
gene, which showed a recurrence risk of 22% in AML [8]. De 
Weer  et  al.  [9]  detected  deletions  within  a  chromosomal 
region of 7q35-q36, which contains the CNTNAP2 gene, in 
both Kasumi-3 and MUTZ-3 cell lines using high-resolution 
array  comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH).  Parti-
cularly, Bejar et al. [10] identified novel associations between 
somatic mutations in two genes, ETV6 and GNAS, and both 
myelodysplastic  syndrome  (previously  known  as  preleu-

kemia) and AML using high-throughput genotyping tech-
nology. In the same year, Link et al. [11] identified a novel 
TP53 susceptibility mutation in AML patients through the 
use  of  whole-genome  sequencing.  Recent  exome-sequen-
cing  studies  found  more  than  60  susceptible  variants, 
including indels and splicing site mutations, in AML patients 
[12]. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the 
previous studies attempted to predict the risk of NK-AML by 
analyzing whole-exome sequencing data.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of nsSNVs in 10 
pairs of tumor and normal cells of NK-AML patients with 
whole-exome sequencing data. Finally, we developed genetic 
risk prediction models for NK-AML by creating genetic risk 
scores (GRS).

Methods
Whole-exome sequencing data analysis

A total of 20 DNA samples were obtained from 10 pairs of 
bone marrow (tumor) and germline (normal) cells collected 
from 10 NK-AML patients. We illustrated the workflow for 
whole-exome sequencing data analysis in Fig. 1. The raw 

Fig.  1.  Next-generation  sequencing  data  analysis  workflow.

reads  in  FASTQ  file  format  were  mapped  to  the  human 
reference, which was developed by the 1,000 genome project 
(human_g1k_v  37.fasta),  by  using  the  Burrows-Wheeler 
aligner (BWA v 0.6.1), which generates SAM format files 
[13]. The SAM files were converted into binary format files 
(BAM) by samtools v0.2.6, which reduces the file size and 
improves  computing  efficiency  [14].  The  read  group 
information of the sequencing machine was added to the 
head of the BAM files. The aligned sequences were sorted in 
the  order  of  chromosomes  by  Picard  v1.79  (http:// 
picard.sourceforge.net) and went through a PCR duplicate 
marking  process,  which  enables  the  Genome  Analysis 
Toolkit  (GATK)  to  ignore  duplicates  in  subsequent 
processing  [15].  Finally,  the  BAM  files  were  indexed  by 
bamtools  v2.2.0  [16].  We  performed  a  local  realignment 
prior to recalibration, which gives the most accurate quality 
scores for each sample. Local realignment with known indel 
sites (Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf, 1000G_ 
phase1.indels.b37.vcf) for each individual does not require 
multiple  sample  realignments,  which  demand  extreme 
computational  power.  However,  we  carried  out  a  local 
realignment with the matched tumor and normal samples 
together  to  prevent  misalignment  due  to  the  differences 
between  these  two  tissue  types.  Recalibration  was  per-
formed  with  multiple  known  sites  (dbSNV_137.b37, 
Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf, and 1000G_ 
phase1.indels.b37.vcf),  which  may  increase  recalibration 
accuracy. We reduced the BAM file size to about 1/100 of the 
original file size by using the GATK tool, which saved variant 
calling time without losing any essential information. We 
used  the  UnifiedGenotyper  of  GATK  for  variant  calling, 
followed by variant recalibration with known sites (hapmap_ 
3.3.b37.vcf,  1000G_omni2.5.b37.vcf,  dbsnp_137.b37.vcf, 
and  Mills_and_1000G_gold_standard.indels.b37.vcf),  and 
annotated by them using snpEff v2.0.57 [17].

Statistical analysis

We performed logistic regression analyses between the 
somatic mutations and NK-AML using PLINK/SEQ v0.08 
(http://atgu.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/plinkseq), which  pro-
vides powerful utilities in variant call format (vcf) for ana-
lyzing whole- exome and -genome data. Further, we verified 
the  odd  ratios  and  p-values  estimated  from  PLINK/SEQ 
using Stata, v11.2 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA).
We selected the somatic nsSNVs with complete call rates 
and  evaluated  the  GRS  models  composed  of  the  variants 
associated with NK-AML. The GRS was calculated for each 
individual by accumulating the number of risk alleles (0, 1, 
or  2)  of  the  SNVs.  We  created  stepwise  GRS  models, 
comprised of the selected SNVs, according to their signi-
ficance level; if the significance level was equal between two

or more SNVs, we selected the SNVs in the order of their 
chromosomal  position.  In  addition,  we  evaluated  a  GRS 
model that consisted of gene variants reported in previous 
leukemia  studies  [9,  10,  18,  19].  We  compared  the  area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 
each GRS model using the “roctab” and “roccomp” com-
mands in Stata.

Results

The improvement in concordance between the empirical 
and reported quality scores of SNVs is shown in Fig. 2A. A 
significant improvement in the accuracy of quality scores 
after recalibration is shown in Fig. 2B. The association test 
for NK-AML yielded 42 SNVs that had a p-value of less than

the  reported  base  quality  scores  to  the  empirical  estimates.  Panel  (B)  shows  the  difference  between  the  average  reported  and  empirical
quality  scores  for  each  machine  cycle.

evidence  for  association,  and  rs6604516  (PPIAL4G;  OR,

21 SNVs. Other SNVs also showed strong effects in the risk 
of NK-AML (OR, 9.33 to 13.5).

We compared the prediction accuracy of 21 stepwise GRS 
models. The predictive power for NK-AML reached 100% in 
model  5,  which  consisted  of  five  nsSNVs:  rs75156964 
(ATP13A3, 3q29), rs56213454 (GNAS, 20q13.3), rs6604516 
(PPIAL4G,  1q21.1),  rs10888338  (OR2T33,  1q44),  and 
rs2443878 (ANKRD36, 2q11.2) (Table 2, Fig. 3A). The five 
SNVs (rs75459784, rs55824312, rs200239604, rs56213454, 
and  rs56371919)  in  three  previously  reported  genes－
MUC4,  CNTNAP2,  and  GNAS－also  showed  a  high  AUC 
value  (AUC,  0.98;  95%  confidence  interval  [CI],  0.92  to

Discussion

We evaluated the effects of 21 nsSNVs of 18 candidate 
genes  for  NK-AML  in  this  study.  Among  18  genes,  we 
replicated  previously  reported  associations  of  two  genes 
(CNTNAP2 and GNAS) with AML [9, 10]. The mutation in 
the MUC4 gene has been reported to be associated with acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia [18, 19]. The MUC4 gene encodes a 
mucin protein and a high-molecular-weight glycoprotein in 
humans.  This  integral  membrane  glycoprotein,  which  is 
observed on the cell surface, plays various roles in tumor 
progression  [20].  Particularly,  MUC4,  complexed  with

v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 
(ERBB2),  results  in  the  repression  of  apoptosis  and  the 
stimulation of proliferation; in addition, the overexpression 
of MUC4 in carcinoma cells promotes loss of cellular polarity 
by ERBB2-mediated disruption [21]. The CNTNAP2 gene is 
one of the largest genes in the entire human genome and 
occupies approximately 1.5% of chromosome 7. This gene 
encodes  a  neurexin  family  member  that  functions  in  the 
vertebrate  nervous  system.  The  GNAS  gene  has  a  highly 
complex imprinted expression pattern. This gene provides 
instructions  for  making  one  component,  the  stimulatory 
alpha  subunit,  of  a  protein  complex  called  a  guanine 
nucleotide-binding  protein  (G-protein).  G-protein  alpha 
subunit regulates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway. GNAS 
gene mutations are known to be associated with high cAMP 
signaling [22]. The novel associations between 15 somatic 
mutations (PPIAL4G, LRRN2, OR2T33, ANKRD36, ATP13A3, 
TRIML1,  PABPC1,  MUC5B,  TAS2R43,  ATF7IP,  KIAA1033, 
ATP8A2 , L2HGDH, LYPD5, and SUSD2) and NK-AML need 
to  be  replicated,  and  their  functional  mechanisms  in  the 
AML should be investigated in future studies.

The  GRS  models  that  were  comprised  of  the  somatic 
nsSNVs showed extremely high predictive accuracy for the 
risk of NK-AML (86% to 100%). The combination of five 
nsSNVs  of  previously  reported  genes  (MUC4,  CNTNAP2, 
and GNAS) had a predictive ability of 98% for the risk of 
NK-AML in this study. One of the limitations in this study 
was the small number of study subjects (n = 10), which 
resulted  in  substantial  variations  in  the  95%  CIs  of  the 
effects (ORs) of each SNV.

In  conclusion,  we  have  highlighted  21  susceptibility 
nsSNVs located in 18 genes. The GRS model that comprises 
five candidate SNVs is highly informative in predicting the 
risk  for  NK-AML.  The  discovery  of  novel  markers  may 
provide  an  opportunity  to  develop  novel  diagnostic  and 
therapeutic targets for NK-AML. Further study with a larger 
sample size is necessary to validate the AML-related gene 
mutations  and  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  develop  a 
powerful genetic risk prediction model for NK-AML.
