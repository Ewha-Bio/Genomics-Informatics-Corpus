Abstract

Monomelic  amyotrophy  (MA),  also  known  as  Hirayama 
disease,  occurs  mainly  in  young  men  and  manifests  as 
weakness  and  wasting  of  the  muscles  of  the  distal  up-
per  limbs.  Here,  we  sought  to  identify  a  genetic  basis 
for  MA.  Given  the  predominance  of  MA  in  males,  we  fo-
cused  on  candidate  neurological  disease  genes  located 
on  the  X  chromosome,  selecting  two  X-linked  candidate 
genes,  androgen  receptor  (AR)  and  ubiquitin-like  modi-
fier  activating  enzyme  1  (UBA1).  Screening  for  genetic 
variants  using  patients’  genomic  DNA  revealed  three 
known  genetic  variants  in  the  coding  region  of  the  AR 
gene:  one  nonsynonymous  single-nucleotide  polymor-
phism  (SNP;  rs78686797)  encoding  Leu57Gln,  and  two 
variants  of  polymorphic  trinucleotide  repeat  segments 
that  encode  polyglutamine  (CAG  repeat;  rs5902610)  and 
polyglycine  (GGC  repeat;  rs3138869)  tracts.  Notably,  the 
Leu57Gln  polymorphism  was  found  in  two  patients  with 
MA  from  24  MA  patients,  whereas  no  variants  were 
found  in  142  healthy  male  controls.  However,  the  num-
bers  of  CAG  and  GGC  repeats  in  the  AR  gene  were 
within  the  normal  range.  These  data  suggest  that  the 
Leu57Gln  polymorphism  encoded  by  the  X-linked  AR 
gene  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  MA.

as  Hirayama  disease,  is  a  rare  motor  neuron  disease 
mainly  afflicting  young  males  that  is  characterized  by 
weakness  and  wasting  of  the  muscles  confined  to  the 
hand  and  forearm,  without  sensory  or  pyramidal  tract  in-
volvement  (Hirayama et al.,  1987).  It  follows  a  non-pro-
gressive  course  after  a  few  years  of  unilateral  or  bi-
lateral  progression  (Misra et al.,  2006).  MA  was  first  re-
ported  as  juvenile  muscular  atrophy  of  an  upper  ex-
tremity  in  Japanese  patients  (Hirayama et al.,  1959).  To 
date,  most  studies  have  involved  a  very  limited  numbers 
of  patients  and  have  focused  on  case  reports,  mainly 
from  Asian  countries  such  as  Japan  and  India.  These 
studies  have  included  38  cases  and  73  cases  with  MA 
in  a  Japanese  population  (Hirayama,  1972;  Hirayama 
and  Tokumaru,  2000),  a  sibling  case 
in  Turkey 
(Gucuyener  et al.,  1991),  44  patients  and  a  case  from 
India  (Gourie-Devi  and  Nalini,  2003;  Nalini et al.,  2004), 
a  sporadic  case  in  an  Italian  man  (Rigamonti  et al., 
2004),  a  young  Swiss  female  patient  with  MA  (Jeannet 
et al.,  2005),  and  15  male  cases  from  14  Indian  families 
(Misra  et al.,  2005).  Currently,  the  pathophysiology  of 
MA  is  not  well  understood  but  various  possibilities  have 
been  considered,  including  autoimmune  and  genetic 
factors,  and  ischemic  changes  of  the  spinal  cord  in-
duced  by  neck  flexion  (Nalini et al.,  2004).  Rare  familial 
cases  have  suggested  the  possibility  of  either  autoso-
mal-recessive  or  autosomal-dominant  inheritance  pat-
terns  in  different  families  (Nalini et al.,  2004;  Schlegel et 
al.,  1987;  Sobue et al.,  1978).  In  the  few  previous  genet-
ic  association  studies,  the  role  of  deletions  in SMN1  and 
SMN2  genes  was  excluded  (Di  Guglielmo  et al.,  1996; 
Gamez et al.,  2007;  Misra et al.,  2005).  In  addition,  ab-
normal  expansion  of  CAG  repeats  of  the  androgen  re-
ceptor  gene  has  not  been  found  in  patients  with  MA 
(Katila  et al.,  2007).  Thus,  the  genetic  cause  of  MA  is 
still  unknown.  However,  the  predominant  occurrence  of 
MA  in  males  suggests  that  gene(s)  in  the  X  chromosome 
may  play  a  role  in  MA  (Misra et al.,  2005).  Thus,  in  this 
study,  we  tested  whether  genetic  variants  found  in  two 
X-linked  neurological  candidate  genes-androgen 
re-
ceptor  (AR)  and  ubiquitin-like  modifier  activating  enzyme 
1  (UBA1)  -are  involved  in  the  development  of  MA  in 
Korean  patients. 

Methods

Subjects

For  the  analysis  of  clinical  characteristics  of  MA,  clinical 
data  were  collected  from  34  patients  who  were  diag-
nosed  at  Asan  Medical  Center.  For  the  genetic  study, 
genomic  DNA  samples  from  a  total  of  24  patients,  in-
cluding  22  males  and  two  females,  were  collected  from 
Asan  Medical  Center  and  Pusan  National  University 
Hospital.  All  patients  were  diagnosed  by  neurologists 
according  to  the  following  diagnostic  criteria:  (1)  in-
sidious  onset  between  age  14  and  25  years;  (ii)  unilat-
eral  or  asymmetric  muscle  weakness  and  wasting  in  the 
hand  and  forearm;  (iii)  lack  of  involvement  of  cranial 
nerves,  pyramidal  tracts,  sphincters  and  sensory  sys-
tems,  and  absence  of  reflex  changes  in  upper  ex-
tremities;  (iv)  nonprogressive  course  and  spontaneous 
arrest  of  disease  within  several  years  after  onset;  (v)  no 
history  of  toxin  exposure,  poliomyelitis,  or  other  causes 
for  clinical  presentations;  and  (vi)  normal  motor  and  sen-
sory  nerve  conductions  and  neurogenic  changes  con-
fined  to  C7,  C8,  and  T1  myotomes  in  electrodiagnostic 
tests  (Hirayama et al.,  1987;  Singh et al.,  1980).  Control 
samples  with  no  history  of  disease  were  obtained  from 
the  Biobank  for  Health  Sciences  at  the  Center  for 
Genome  Sciences  in  Seoul,  Korea.  The  study  was  ap-
proved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Asan 
Medical  Center,  University  of  Ulsan  College  of  Medicine, 
Seoul,  Korea.  All  patients  or  their  parents  provided  writ-
ten  informed  consent. 

Candidate  gene  sequencing

To  identify  candidate  causal  variants,  we  sequenced 
two  X-linked  candidate  genes  (AR and UAB1)  using  ge-
nomic  DNA  from  nine  patients  with  MA  and  one  healthy 
control  subject.  Genomic  sequences  of  AR and  UAB1 
the 
for  sequencing  analysis  were  obtained 

from 

Androgen  Receptor  and  Monomelic  Amyotrophy    65

GenBank  (http://www.ncbi/nlm.nih.gov/)  database,  and 
polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  primers  to  amplify  cod-
ing  regions  and  promoter  regions  (500  bp  upstream 
from  exon  10  of  the  genes)  were  designed  using 
Primer3  software  (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/).  Each 
fragment  amplified  by  PCR  was  sequenced  with  an  ABI 
Prism  3730  sequencer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City, 
CA,  USA).  DNA  polymorphisms  were  identified  using  the 
PolyPhred  program  (http://droog.gs.washington.edu/pol-
yphred/).  For  the  genetic  association  study,  candidate 
variants  found  in  the  AR gene  were  genotyped  by  re-
sequencing  using  all  24  patients  with  MA  and  142 
healthy  control  subjects. 

Statistical  analysis

Statistical  analyses  for  the  case-control  study  were  per-
formed  using  SPSS  (version  18)  software  (SPSS  Inc., 
Chicago,  IL,  USA).  The  association  with  MA  was  tested 
using  Fisher’s  exact  test. 

Results

Clinical  characteristics  of  MA  in  Koreans 

Since  1989,  a  total  of  34  patients,  including  two  fe-
males,  have  been  diagnosed  with  MA  at  Asan  Medical 
Center.  The  clinical  characteristics  of  MA  in  these 
Korean  patients  were  analyzed  based  on  clinical  data. 
Similar  to  previously  reported  by  another  groups,  MA 
exhibited  a  predominantly  juvenile  onset,  between  age 
15  and  25  (mean  age  at  disease  onset,  17.65  years), 
and  mainly  affected  males  (Fig.  1).  In  27  of  34  patients 
(79.4%),  symptom  onset  occurred  before  20  years  of 
age.  There  was  no  family  history  of  MA  or  other  neuro-
logic  disorders  affecting  anterior  horn  cells.  Arm  weak-
ness  started  unilaterally  in  all  patients,  but  subsequently 
affected  the  other  side  within  1  year  in  five  patients 
(14.7%).  The  initial  progression  was  stabilized  1-5  years

Identification  of  genetic  variants  in  X-linked  AR 
and UBA1 genes

The  clinical  features  of  MA  bear  some  resemblance  to 
spinal  muscular  atrophy  (SMA),  Kennedy  disease,  and 
familial  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (ALS).  We  hypothe-
sized  that  a  different  mutation  in  that  same  gene  that 
causes  these  neurological  diseases  (i.e.,  allelic  hetero-
geneity)  could  result  in  a  slightly  different  phenotype  in 
MA.  In  order  to  test  our  hypothesis,  we  initially  selected 

20  candidate  genes  (ALS2, ANG, AR, BSCL2, DCTN1, 
FIG4, FUS, GARS, HMN7B, HSPB8, IGHMBP2, NEFH, 
PRPH, PLEKHG5, SETX, SMN1, SMN2, SOD1, TARFBP, 
UBA1, VAPB)  that  are  involved  in  either  SMA,  Kennedy 
disease  or  familial  ALS.  In  addition,  94%  of  our  Korean 
MA  patients  were  males,  suggesting  that  genetic  defects 
on  the  X  chromosome  might  play  a  crucial  role  in  MA. 
Thus,  among  the  initially  selected  20  neurological  candi-
date  genes,  we  focused  on  the  X-linked  genes, AR and 
UBA1.  After  sequencing  of  promoter  regions  and  coding 
regions  in  the AR and UBA1  genes  using  genomic  DNA 
from  nine  MA  patients  and  one  normal  control,  we

found  a  total  of  seven  genetic  variants,  four  in  the  AR 
gene  and  three  in  the  UBA1 gene  (Table  1).  Notably, 
three  AR gene  variants  contained  substitutions  located 
in  the  coding  region  that  altered  the  amino  acid  se-
quence:  one  was  a  nonsynonymous  single-nucleotide 
polymorphism  (SNP;  rs78686797)  encoding  Leu57Gln, 
and  two  were  polymorphic  trinucleotide  repeat  seg-
ments  that  encoded  polyglutamine  (rs5902610;  CAG-re-
peat)  and  polyglycine  (rs3138869;  GGC-repeat)  tracts. 
We  mainly  focused  on  these  coding  polymorphisms  in 
AR gene  for  genetic  association  study  with  MA. 

Association  of  the  Leu57Gln  polymorphism  en-
coded  by  the  X-linked  AR gene  with  MA

Among  24  patients  with  MA,  two  male  patients  pos-
sessed  the  Leu57Gln  polymorphism,  whereas  none  of 
the  normal  controls  (n=56)  used  in  an  initial  case-control 
study  carried  this  variant  (Fig.  2).  Furthermore,  this  var-
iant  was  not  detected  even  in  a  larger  set  of  control 
samples  (n=142),  demonstrating  a  significant  association 
with  MA  (p=0.02;  Fisher’s  exact  test;  Table  2).  In  addi-
tion,  an  in silico prediction  of  the  functionality  of  the 
leu57Gln  polymorphism  using  the  program  PolyPhen 
showed  the  polymorphism  site  to  be  “probably  damag-
ing”  (Table  1).  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that  the  Leu57Gln 
polymorphism  is  biologically  functional,  suggesting  that 
it  may  contribute  to  the  development  of  MA.  On  the 
other  hand,  however,  the  numbers  of  variable  CAG  re-
peats  (rs5902610)  and  GGC  repeats  (rs3138869)  in  the 
AR gene  were  within  the  normal  range,  and  their  fre-
quencies  were  very  similar  to  those  of  healthy  controls 
(Fig.  2).  This  result  indicates  that  variation  in  CAG  and 
GGC  repeats  does  not  likely  contribute  to  the  develop-
ment  of  MA. 

Discussion

MA  is  a  very  rare  neurological  disease,  making  genetic 
studies  very  difficult.  Most  studies  conducted  to  date 
have  included  a  very  limited  numbers  of  patients  and 

Androgen  Receptor  and  Monomelic  Amyotrophy    67

have  focused  on  case  reports.  Rare  familial  MA  cases 
have  suggested  that  MA  can  be  inherited  in  a  dominant 
or  recessive  manner  in  different  families  (Nalini  et al., 
2004).  Moreover,  MA  occurs  almost  exclusively  in  male 
patients  (Misra et al.,  2005),  thus,  we  hypothesized  that 
gene(s)  on  the  X  chromosome  may  play  a  crucial  role 
in  MA.  In  this  study,  we  selected  the  two  X-linked 
genes, AR and UBA1,  from  among  the  candidate  genes 
of  the  similar  neurological  diseases,  SMA,  Kennedy  dis-
ease  and  familial  ALS.  Interestingly,  a  polymorphism  of 
the AR gene  encoding  Leu57Gln  was  found  in  two  of  24 
MA  patients,  whereas  no  variation  at  the  same  SNP  site 
was  found  in  142  healthy  male  controls  (Table  2). 
Furthermore,  the  resulting  substitution  was  probably 
damaging  based  on  an in silico prediction  of  the  func-
tional  effect  of  the  nonsynonymous  SNP.  The  biological 
importance  of  the  Leu57Gln  polymorphism  is  not  yet 
clear.  However,  the  Leu57Gln  substitution,  located  im-
mediately  adjacent  to  the  CAG-repeat,  might  be  im-
portant  in  the  biological  functions  of  the  AR protein, 
since  the  glutamine  tracts  encoded  by  the  CAG-repeats 
region  in  exon  1  of  the AR gene  are  involved  in  receptor 
function  and  are  associated  with  human  neuro-
degenerative  disease  (Lieberman,  2008;  Rusmini,  2010). 
However,  variations  in  two  polymorphic  trinucleotide  re-
peat  segments  that  encode  polyglutamine  and  poly-
glycine  tracts  of  the AR protein  do  not  seem  to  directly 
contribute  to  the  MA  phenotype,  because  their  ex-
pansions  are  in  the  normal  range  (∼15-28  repeats  for 
CAG  and  ∼12-18  repeats  for  GGC)  and  their  frequen-
cies  are  similar  to  those  of  control  groups.  Notably, 
whereas  expansion  (≥40)  of  the  CAG  repeat  encoding 
polyglutamine  tracts  causes  spinal  bulbar  muscular  atro-
phy  (Kennedy  disease)  (La  Spada  et al.,  1991),  it  does 
not  seem  to  influence  the  development  of  MA.  Our 
study  and  those  of  others  have  reported  a  sex-depend-
ent  prevalence  of  MA,  predominantly  in  males  (Misra et 
al.,  2005).  Thus,  it  is  reasonable  to  speculate  that  the 
high  prevalence  of  MA  in  males  may  be  mediated  by 
defects  in  the  androgen  response  attributable  to  the 
Leu57Gln  substitution  in  the AR protein,  because  muta-
tions  in  the  AR gene  are  associated  with  androgen  in-
sensitivity  (McPhaul  et al.,  1992).  Furthermore,  it  has 
been  reported  that  expansion  of  the  number  of  gluta-
mine  repeats  increases  neurotoxicity  in  motor  neurons 
of  the  spinal  cord  (Lee  et al.,  2003).  Therefore,  the 
change  of  leucine  to  glutamine  at  residue  57  of  the AR 
protein  could  cause  neurotoxicity  in  spinal  motor  neu-
rons-a  characteristic  feature  of  MA.  We  also  cannot  ex-
clude  the  possible  joint  involvement  of  environmental 
factors,  such  as  testosterone  or  androgen  effects,  in  the 
development  of  MA.  Although  we  found  the  Leu57Gln 
polymorphism  in  MA  patients  only,  it  is  premature  to 

68    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(2)  64-68,  June  2011

conclude  that  the AR gene  is  a  causal  or  susceptibility 
gene  for  MA.  One  major  limitation  of  our  study  is  its 
small  sample  size,  a  limitation  inherent  in  studies  of  rare 
diseases  and  one  that  is  shared  by  previous  genetic 
studies  of  MA  (Misra  et al.,  2005;  Di  Guglielmo  et al., 
1996).  Therefore,  further  studies  using  other  independent 
sample  sets  are  necessary  to  validate  our  results. 
In  summary,  we  found  a  polymorphism  in  the AR gene 
encoding  a  Leu57Gln  variant  in  MA  patients  only. 
However,  no  significant  changes  in  polymorphic  trinu-
cleotide  repeat  segments  were  observed  in  MA  patients. 
Our  results  suggest  that  disruption  of  AR protein  func-
tion  caused  by  the  Leu57Gln  substitution  may  play  a 
role  in  the  development  of  MA.
