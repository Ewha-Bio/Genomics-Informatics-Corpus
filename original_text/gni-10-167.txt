AKT  is  a  signal  transduction  protein  that  plays  a  central  role  in  the  tumorigenesis.  There  are  3  mammalian  isoforms  of  this 
serine/threonine  protein  kinase－AKT1,  AKT2,  and  AKT3－showing  a  broad  tissue  distribution.  We  first  discovered  2  novel 
polymorphisms (AKT2 -9826 C/G and AKT3 -811 A/G), and we confirmed 6 known polymorphisms (AKT2 -9473 C/T, AKT2 -9151 C/T, 
AKT2 -9025 C/T, AKT2 -8618G/A, AKT3 -675 A/-, and AKT3 -244 C/T) of the AKT2 and AKT3 promoter region in 24 blood samples 
of Korean lung cancer patients using direct sequencing. To evaluate the role of AKT2 and AKT3 polymorphisms in the risk of Korean 
lung cancer, genotypes of the AKT2 and AKT3 polymorphisms (AKT2 -9826 C/G, AKT2 -9473 C/T, AKT2 -9151 C/T, AKT2 -9025 C/T, 
AKT2 -8618G/A, and AKT3 -675 A/-) were determined in 360 lung cancer patients and 360 normal controls. Statistical analyses 
revealed that the genotypes and haplotypes in the AKT2 and AKT3 promoter regions were not significantly associated with the risk 
of lung cancer in the Korean population. These results suggest that polymorphisms of the AKT2 and AKT3 promoter regions do not 
contribute to the genetic susceptibility to lung cancer in the Korean population.

Introduction

Lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths  in  Korea,  and  its  incidence  continues  to  rise  [1]. 
Despite  therapeutic  advances,  the  overall  5-year  survival 
remains only 15% [2]. Lung cancer is a multicellular and 
multistage  process  that  involves  a  number  of  genetic 
changes in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Never-
theless,  the  prognosis  of  lung  cancer  has  remained  poor 
despite  innovations  in  diagnostic  testing  and  surgical 
technique and the development of new chemotherapeutic 
agents. Recently introduced targeted agents show different 
responses  according  to  histological  subtype,  and  the  effi-
ciency of treatment modalities for lung cancer depends on 
the time of diagnosis [3]. Therefore, there is a great need for 
rapid and efficient early detection methods. For developing 
improved molecular biomarkers for the early detection and 
prediction of response to chemotherapy, it is important to 

identify genetic alterations specific to each subtype of lung 
cancer. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent 
an  important  class  of  genetic  variations  and  affect  an 
individual’s  susceptibility  to  disease  in  certain  circum-
stances [4-6]. 

Activation of the intracellular survival signal transduction 
protein AKT, known as protein kinase B, has been proposed 
as a central signaling event in carcinogenesis and has been 
shown  in  experimental  models  to  confer  resistance  to 
chemotherapy  and  radiation  [7,  8].  AKT  is  activated  by 
phosphatidylinositol 3 phosphates,  the products of phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity [9]. Additionally, AKT 
activity  is  commonly  dysregulated  in  a  variety  of  human 
tumors because of frequent inactivation of the PTEN tumor 
suppressor  gene,  which  negatively  regulates  phosphati-
dylinositol 3 phosphate levels, and alterations of this gene 
have  been  identified  in  various  cancers,  including  lung 
cancer [10, 11]. To date, 3 human isoforms of AKT have been

identified, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3, which are expressed in 
lung, breast, colon, and prostate tumor tissues [12].

Somatic  mutations  of  AKTs  have  been  reported  in 
endometrial carcinomas, hypoglycemia, and breast cancer 
[13, 14]. However, somatic mutations in AKT families are 
rare in lung cancer [15, 16]. Previously, it was reported that 
an  AKT1  polymorphism  was  not  associated  with  schizo-
phrenia [17, 18]. AKT1 and AKT2 polymorphisms have been 
reported to be related to survival of esophageal cancer [19], 
and  it  was  reported  that  an  AKT1  polymorphism  was 
associated with survival in surgically resected non-small cell 
lung cancer [20]. However, the association between AKT2 
and AKT3 polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer has not 
yet been clarified. This study discovered polymorphisms of 
the AKT2 and AKT3 promoter regions and their relation with 
the risk of lung cancer in a Korean population. 

Methods
Study subjects

Between August 2001 and November 2010, blood sam-
ples were collected from 720 subjects, including 360 lung 
cancer  patients  and  360  normal  controls  without  cancer. 
Lung cancer patients were recruited from the patient pool at 
the Genomic Research Center for Lung and Breast/Ovarian 
Cancer, and control subjects were randomly selected from a 
pool  of  healthy  volunteers  who  had  visited  the  Cardio-
vascular Genome Center and Genomic Research Center for 
Allergy and Respiratory Diseases. Detailed information on 
diet, smoking status, drinking status, lifestyle, and medical 
history  were  collected  by  trained  interviewers  using  a 
structured questionnaire. Out of 360 cases, information was 
available for 352 on smoking status, 317 on stage, and 343 on 
cell  type,  while  information  was  available  for  272  on 
smoking status of 360 controls. All study subjects provided 
written  consent  and  were  ethnic  Koreans,  and  all  parti-
cipating  Institutional  Review  Boards  approved  the  study 
protocol.

Preparation of genomic DNA and direct sequencing

Genomic  DNA  was  prepared  from  peripheral  blood 
samples  using  a  Puregene  blood  DNA  kit  (Gentra,  Min-
neapolis, MN, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. 
To identify polymorphisms in the promoter of the AKT2 
and AKT3 genes, human genomic DNA was isolated from 
the  whole  blood  of  24  lung  cancer  patients  for  direct 
sequencing, and the promoter region of the AKT2 and AKT3 
genes was amplified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) am-
plifications were performed on a PTC-225 Peltier Thermal 
cycler (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) using Ampli-
TagGold (Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA). All amplifications 

were performed using 35 cycles of 30 s at 95oC, 1 min at 
64oC,  and  1  min  at  72oC,  followed  by  a  single  10-min 
extension at 72oC. PCR products were purified using the 
Montage PCR96 Cleanup kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) 
and  eluted  in  20  μL  of  nuclease-free  H2O.  DNA  cycle 
sequencing was carried out using the BigDye Terminator V 
3.1  Cycle  Sequencing  kit  (Perkin  Elmer,  Foster  City,  CA, 
USA). Multiscreen SEQ 384-well filter plates were used for 
dye  removal,  and  sequences  were  then  analyzed  on  an 
Applied Biosystems 3700 (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). All 
polymorphisms  and  sequence  alignments  were  analyzed 
using Polyphred.

Genotyping 

After direct sequencing of the AKT2 and AKT3 genes, we 
performed genotyping for the 8 polymorphisms of the AKT2 
and  AKT3  genes.  The  genotypes  of  the  AKT2  and  AKT3 
polymorphisms  were  screened  by  TaqMan  fluorogenic  5' 
nuclease assay (ABI). The final volume of the PCR was 5 μL, 
containing  10  ng  of  genomic  DNA,  and  2.5  μL  TaqMan 
Universal PCR Master Mix, with 0.13 μL of 40 × Assay Mix. 
Thermal cycle conditions were as follows: 50oC for 2 min to 
activate  uracil  N-glycosylase  and  prevent  carryover 
contamination,  95oC  for  10  min  to  activate  the  DNA 
polymerase, and 45 cycles of 95oC for 15 s and 60oC for 1 
min. All PCRs were performed using 384-well plates on a 
Dual 384-Well GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (ABI), and the 
endpoint  fluorescent readings were performed on an  ABI 
PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (ABI). Dupli-
cate samples and negative controls were included to ensure 
accuracy of genotyping.

Statistical analysis

Allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, and departures 
of genotype distributions from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(HWE) for each SNP were analyzed using chi-square test or 
Fisher’s  exact  test.  A  p-value  of  ＜0.05  was  considered 
statistically  significant.  Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  was 
tested on pairwise combinations of polymorphisms using 
the absolute value of the standardized measure of LD, D’, 
calculated  by  Haploview  version  3.2.  The  haplotypes  and 
their frequencies were estimated by Haploview version 3.2. 
Genotype-specific risks were estimated as odds ratios with 
associated 95% confidence intervals by unconditional logi-
stic  regression  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  and 
adjusted for age, gender, and smoking status.

controls. This difference of smoking status was controlled in 
the multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, 
gender, and smoking status. 

By direct sequencing of the AKT2 promoter region in 24 
lung cancer patient samples, we identified 1 novel polymor-
phism (－9826 C/G) and 4 known polymorphisms (－9473 
C/T, －9151 C/T, －9025 C/T, and －8618 G/A). Also, we 
identified 1 novel polymorphism (－811 A/G) and 2 known 
polymorphisms  (－675  A/－ and  －244  C/T)  by  direct 
sequencing  in  the  AKT3  promoter  region  (Table  2).  The 
genotype distributions of the polymorphisms were in HWE. 
Also, LD and haplotypes in the polymorphisms of AKT2 were 
calculated. However, the LD and haplotype block in AKT3 
polymorphisms  were  unidentified  because  of  the  low 
frequency of the AKT3-811 G allele and AKT3-244 T allele 
(2.1%  and  2.2%,  respectively)  (Fig.  1).  Accordingly,  we

focused  on  the  －675  A/－ polymorphism  in  the  AKT3 
promoter region. Further analyses were then performed on 
the samples from 460 lung cancer patients and 460 controls.
Association of lung cancer risk with AKT polymorphisms 
was  then  analyzed,  revealing  no  association  of  the  poly-
morphisms  with  the  risks  of  lung  cancer  (Table  3).  The 
association  of  the  polymorphisms  with  the  risk  of  lung 
cancer was further examined after stratifying the subjects 
according  to  gender  and  smoking  status.  However,  the 
subsequent  analysis  revealed  no  significant  association. 
Furthermore, the haplotypes of the AKT2 polymorphisms 
were  not  associated  with  the  risks  of  lung  cancer  in  3 
alternative models (data not shown).

Discussion

V-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) is 
a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by PI3K-α 
and mediates PI3L signaling [21]. A major recurrent muta-
tion (Glu17Lys) in the AKT1 gene, which encodes protein 
kinase  B,  has  been  identified  in  several  solid  tumors, 
including breast, colon, and ovarian cancers [22]. Overall, 
the  frequency  of  AKT1  mutations  in  non-small  cell  lung 
carcinoma (NSCLC) is about 1%, and they have only been 
identified in squamous cell carcinoma [23]. Also, mutations 
in  the  AKT2  and  AKT3  genes  are  rare  in  several  tumors, 
including lung cancer [15].

Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and  p-values were  calculated  by unconditional  logistic regression, adjusted for  age, gender,  and smoking 
history.
Logistic  regression  models  were  used  to  calculate  the  aORs,  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  and  the  corresponding  p-values  of 
co-dominant  (minor  allele  homozygotes  vs.  heterozygotes  vs.  major  allele  homozygotes),  dominant  (minor  allele  homozygotes  ＋
heterozygotes vs.  major  allele homozygotes),  and  recessive  (minor  allele  homozygotes vs.  heterozygotes  ＋ major allele  homozygotes) 
models  after  controlling  for  age,  gender,  and  smoking  status.

Recently, several polymorphisms in the AKT1 gene have 
been reported in relation to human disease [24-26]. Kim et 
al. [20] first reported that the AKT1 polymorphisms could be 
used  as  prognostic  markers  for  patients  with  early-stage 
NSCLC.  However,  there  has  been  no  study  on  the  asso-
ciation  between  lung  cancer  risk  and  polymorphisms  of 
AKT2  and  AKT3.  In  this  study,  we  investigated  the  asso-
ciation between AKT2 and AKT3 polymorphisms and the risk 
of lung cancer in the Korean population. The genotypes and 
haplotypes of the AKT2 and AKT3 genes were determined in 
720  Koreans  to  evaluate  the  role  of  the  AKT2  and  AKT3 
polymorphisms  in  the  risk  of  lung  cancer;  however,  the 
results  revealed  no  significant  difference  between  lung 
cancer patients and normal controls. Also, by TFSEARCH 
(version 1.3) analysis of the AKT2 and AKT3 polymorphism 
regions, the location of these variants did not have sequences 
for transcription factor binding sites. This result suggests 
that polymorphisms of the AKT2 and AKT3 promoter region 
are unlikely to play an important role in the susceptibility to 

lung cancer.

rs35814223, 

Polymorphisms often show ethnic variation [6, 27]. In the 
present  study,  we  observed  the  frequencies  of  5  poly-
morphisms in the AKT2 promoter region, and we observed 
frequencies  of  3  polymorphisms  in  the  AKT3  promoter 
region in 24 Korean populations using direct sequencing. In 
the direct sequencing result, we detected no frequencies in 
another  known  polymorphisms  (AKT2:  rs11666690, 
rs11665880, 
rs35408040, 
rs10418387; AKT3: rs11588441, rs6679386, rs41267521). 
The frequencies of AKT2 promoter polymorphisms showed 
similar frequencies in the Asian ethnic groups (Han Chinese 
and Japanese) of the dbSNP database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih. 
gov/SNP). The frequency of the minor allele of rs35835614 
in the AKT3 gene was 0.275; however, the frequency of this 
polymorphism has not been reported in the dbSNP database 
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP). A series of our previous stu-
dies  showed  that  polymorphisms  of  oncogenes,  tumor 
suppressor genes, and receptor tyrosine kinases are related

to lung cancer risk [6, 28, 29]. Recently, we reported that 
STK11 and PIK3CA polymorphisms are not related to genetic 
susceptibility to lung cancer [30, 31]. The genotypes of the 
AKT2 and AKT3 promoter polymorphisms, determined in 
720 Koreans in the present study, revealed no significant 
difference  between  lung  cancer  patients  and  normal 
controls. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on the 
association of AKT2 and AKT3 promoter polymorphisms and 
the risk of lung cancer in a Korean population.
