A retron is a bacterial retroelement that encodes an RNA gene and a reverse transcriptase (RT). The former, once transcribed, 
works as a template primer for reverse transcription by the latter. The resulting DNA is covalently linked to the upstream part 
of the RNA; this chimera is called multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA), which is extrachromosomal DNA found in many 
bacterial species. Based on the conserved features in the eight known msDNA sequences, we developed a detection method 
and applied it to scan National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq bacterial genome sequences. Among 
16,844 bacterial sequences possessing a retron-type RT domain, we identified 48 unique types of msDNA. Currently, the 
biological role of msDNA is not well understood. Our work will be a useful tool in studying the distribution, evolution, and 
physiological role of msDNA.

Introduction

A retron is a 2-kb-long bacterial retroelement that carries 
a promoter and three genes: msr, msd, and ret. The msr/msd 
part of the transcript is processed by a reverse transcriptase 
encoded by ret, resulting in an RNA/DNA chimera called 
multicopy  single-stranded  DNA  (msDNA)  [1].  The  RNA 
and DNA parts of msDNA are encoded by msr and msd, 
respectively.  The  precursor  RNA  molecule  possesses  a 
palindrome between the 5′ and 3′ ends, forming a double- 
stranded region between both ends (Fig. 1A). The 5′ part of 
the  palindrome  is  followed  by  a  G  residue,  which  is  the 
branching point for covalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B) 
[2]. The msr portion of the precursor RNA possesses two 
stem-loop structures, which are recognized by the reverse 
transcriptase  [3].  The  msd  part  of  the  resulting  chimera, 
shown in black in Fig. 1C, is palindromic, also forming a 
large hairpin structure.

While  msDNA  is  found  in  many  bacterial  species,  its 
biological role is not well understood. Furthermore, msDNA 
is not well annotated in public sequence databases. In order 
to facilitate the biological characterization of msDNA, we set 
out  to  compile  msDNA  sequences  from  known  bacterial 
genomes.  Using  a  few  known  msDNA  sequences,  we 

extracted  common  sequence  and  structural  features.  We 
screened  National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information 
(NCBI) RefSeq bacterial genome sequences using this rule

to compile potential msDNA sequences. Their authenticity 
as msDNA needs to be confirmed experimentally.

Methods
Prototype msDNA sequences and their features

We  used  one  of  the  published  Escherichia  coli  msDNA 
sequences  (GenBank  accession  No.  U02551)  [2]  as  the 
query  in  a  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLASTN) 
search  of  NCBI  GenBank  High  Throughput  Genomic 
Sequence  (HTGS)  division.  From  the  BLASTN  hits,  we 
manually  curated  seven  other  known  msDNA  sequences 
(Table 1). By visual inspection of these prototype msDNA 
sequences, several common features were recognized: (1) 
the length of palindrome between the 5′ and 3′ ends ranged 
from  5 bp  to  10  bp;  (2)  the distance  between  both  ends 
ranged from 140 bp to 200 bp; (3) the residues flanking the 
palindrome were conserved G residues in both strands; and 
(4) the distance between msr/msd and ret was less than 2 kb.
We developed a local python script that enforces these 

rules in the candidate retron sequences.

Gene prediction and protein domain search

From  the  downloaded  DNA  sequences,  genes  were 
predicted with the GeneMark suite [4]. The input sequences 
were split into 20-kb batches, and GeneMark was run for each 
batch with the default settings. The predicted genes were 
translated into protein sequences, which were then scanned 
for the Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) domain using 
Reverse Position Specific (RPS)-BLAST. COG is a microbial 
domain database distributed by NCBI. RPS-BLAST is one of 
the  BLAST  applications  distributed  by  NCBI  and  uses 

position-specific  scoring  matrices  (PSSMs)  as  the  target 
database [5]. We looked for hits of the accession COG3344 
(PSSM ID: 225881), which stands for “Retron-type reverse 
transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, transposons).”

Palindrome motif search
One  of  the  characteristic  features  of  msDNA  is  a 
palindrome formed by its 5′ and 3′ ends. In order to detect 
such a feature in the potential retron sequences, we used a 
local  installation  of  the  software  tool  palindrome  in  the 
European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS) 
bioinformatics  software  package  [6].  It  requires  several 
options to be set. The minimum and maximum lengths of a 
palindrome  and  the  maximum  distance  between  a 
palindrome pair were set to 5, 10, and 200 bp, respectively, 
while the number of mismatches between a palindrome pair 
was set to 1.

Profile search of msDNA

A  multiple-sequence  alignment  of  the  eight  prototype 
msDNA sequences was generated with ClustalW (Fig. 2). 
We then built a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile from 
the  multiple-sequence  alignment  using  the  software  tool 
HmmerBuild  in  the  HMMER  package  [7].  The  potential 
retron sequences were screened using HmmerSearch with 
the  HMM  profile  [7].  The  cutoff  for  a  specific  hit  was 
determined by leave-one-out crossvalidation as follows: (1) 
among the eight seed sequences, one was set aside, and the 
remaining seven were used to build the profile; (2) what was 
set  aside  was  then  evaluated  using  the  profile;  (3)  this 
process was repeated for each of the eight seeds, and the 
minimum score was defined as the cutoff (45.0).

Fig.  2. Multiple-sequence alignment of prototype multicopy single-stranded DNA sequences. The msr/msd portion of each genomic DNA
sequence in Table 1 was used to construct the alignment with ClustalW. The corresponding secondary structures, predicted with CentroidFold, 
are  shown  in  bracket  notation.  The  conserved  positions  are  colored  with  Jalview.

RNA secondary structure prediction

The  precursor  RNA  molecule  of  msDNA  forms  a 
characteristic  secondary  structure.  We  used  a  local  in-
stallation of the software tool CentroidFold [8] to predict the 
secondary structure of the msr/msd portion of the candidate 
retron. As the palindrome terminates with a G residue in 
both  strands,  the  5′  of  which  is  the  branching  point  for 
covalent bonding to the cDNA (Fig. 1B), sequences without 
these G residues were removed. The web service version of 
RNAfold  [9]  was  also  used  to  visually  confirm  the  final 
prediction set.

Results
Compilation of candidate retron sequences from 
known genome sequences

Historically, msDNA has been discovered exclusively in 
bacteria.  A  keyword  search  of  NCBI  RefSeq  bacterial 
genomes with “reverse transcriptase” returned 34,637 hits, 
as of September 2, 2015. Following the gene prediction of 
these genomes using GeneMark, a protein domain search for 
“Retron-type reverse transcriptase (mobilome: prophages, 
transposons)”  using  RPS-BLAST  resulted 
in  16,844 
candidate retron sequences. 

Alternatively,  filtering  out  nonretron-type  reverse  tran-
scriptase  sequences  can  be  also  achieved  by  extracting 
protein sequences from the RefSeq annotation, followed by 
the domain search. Instead, we chose to predict genes from 
the  genome  sequences  using  GeneMark,  followed  by  the 
domain search. Our approach does not rely on annotation 
information and has the potential to be applied to newly 
sequenced genomes as an independent tool.

Automatic filtration of candidate msDNA sequences

The  candidate  retron  sequences  identified  above  were 
filtered by the presence of palindrome motifs. Using the local 
python script, we searched the 16,844 bacterial sequences for 
palindrome motifs 5–10-bp-long and separated by less than 
200 bp within 2 kb upstream of ret, yielding 7,428,332 such 
hits. These hits were then screened by the HMM models that 
were developed based on the prototype msDNA sequences.

coli (N,  504). The single  letters  and  numbers  in  parentheses  refer 
to  the  clustering  group  and  sequence  number  in  Supplementary 
Table  1.

There  were  3,865  hits  surpassing  the  crossvalidation 
threshold of 45.0. Using a local installation of CentroidFold, 
the  RNA  secondary  structures  were  predicted  for  the 
remaining hits, and those without the proper double-strand 
pairing between the 5′ and 3′ ends were removed. Further-
more, those without the conserved flanking G residues were 
also filtered out. The whole process, which was wrapped in a 
Linux shell script, resulted in 625 hits. 

Manual curation and clustering of msDNA 
sequences

The  final  set  of  625  candidate  sequences  that  were 
identified by an automatic process was highly redundant. The 
exact copies were pruned, giving rising to a set of 88 unique 
sequence types. As shown in Fig. 1A, the true msDNA should 
possess two hairpins in msr and a long hairpin in the msd 
region. In order to confirm this complex overall topology of 
msDNA, we examined the RNA secondary structure plots of 
the 88 candidates visually. In fact, we removed 40 sequences 
that did not form the appropriate overall topology. See Fig. 3 
for  a  few  representative  surviving  examples.  Among  the 
original  625  sequences,  525  can  be  mapped  to  these  48

unique sequence types (Supplementary Table 1).

In  order  to  cluster  the  remaining  48  sequence  types 
further, allowing small divergences within clusters, multiple- 
sequence alignment was performed with Multiple Alignment 
using  Fast  Fourier  Transform  (MAFFT)  [10].  From  the 

resulting dendrogram, we recognized 20 groups by splitting 
the tree at a branch length of between 0.12 and 0.20 (Fig. 4). 
The species distribution of the 525 msDNA sequences over 
the 20 groups is given in Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1.

Discussion

We developed a rule-based protocol to detect msDNA in a 
given  genomic  DNA  sequence.  The  rule  is  based  on  the 
presence  of  a  5–10-bp-long  palindrome  motif  in  the 
precursor  transcript  that  is  less  than  2  kb  upstream  of  a 
retron-type reverse transcriptase gene. The rule is augmented 
by  enforcing  a  sequence  similarity  with  known  msDNA 
sequences. This step is implemented with an HMM profile 
search method. While this was a powerful filtration step, 
reducing the hits by about 1/20, it would inevitably miss 
some true msDNA sequences that are distantly related to the 
prototypes  given  in  Table  1.  As  more  distinct  msDNA 
sequences are discovered, the panel of the seed sequences 
must be updated. 

The  list  of  potential  candidate  msDNA  sequences  was 
filtered by conformation to the known topology of the RNA 
secondary  structure.  The  RNA  secondary  structure  pre-
diction  programs  usually  output  the  result  in  terms  of 
Vienna dot bracket notation [9]. As the manipulation of the 
string  is  not  straightforward,  some  manual  curation  was 
involved. In the future,  we will explore the possibility of 
automatic implementation, which is critical for web-based 
service of the prediction tool. To our knowledge, this is the 
first  large-scale  annotation  of  msDNA  in  all  publically 
available  bacterial  genome  sequences.  As  our  work  is 
computational in nature, the list we compiled can include 
some  false  positives.  Its  authenticity  should  be  validated 
experimentally. Nevertheless, our list of msDNA sequences 
and  their  species  distribution  profile  constitute  a  useful 
resource for the future study of msDNA, as its biological role 
is still elusive.
