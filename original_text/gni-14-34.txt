Due to advances in omics technologies, numerous genome-wide studies on human samples have been published, and most 
of  the  omics  data  with  the  associated  clinical  information  are  available  in  public  repositories,  such  as  Gene  Expression 
Omnibus and ArrayExpress. While analyzing several public datasets, we observed that errors in gender information occur 
quite often in public datasets. When we analyzed the gender description and the methylation patterns of gender-specific 
probes (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD], ephrin-B1 [EFNB1], and testis specific protein, Y-linked 2 [TSPY2]) in 
5,611 samples produced using Infinium 450K HumanMethylation arrays, we found that 19 samples from 7 datasets were 
erroneously  described.  We  also  analyzed  1,819  samples  produced  using  the  Affymetrix  U133Plus2  array  using  several 
gender-specific genes (X (inactive)-specific transcript [XIST], eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A, Y-linked [EIF1AY], and 
DEAD [Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp] box polypeptide 3, Y-linked [DDDX3Y]) and found that 40 samples from 3 datasets were erroneously 
described. We suggest that the users of public datasets should not expect that the data are error-free and, whenever possible, 
that they should check the consistency of the data.

Introduction

The  completion  of  the  human  genome  project  has 
accelerated  the  development  of  many  omics  technologies 
that  have  been  used  extensively  for  the  genomewide 
profiling of human samples [1]. Public repositories, such as 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and ArrayExpress, now 
hold data on hundreds of thousands of samples profiled by 
diverse technologies [2, 3]. For many of the samples in the 
public repositories, various kinds of clinical information are 
also included so that interested researchers can use them for 
their own research interests.

While  these  public  data  have  enormous  potential  for 
research use, it is inevitable that unknown errors may creep 
into public datasets without being noticed by depositors. For 
example,  Microsoft  Excel  is  notorious  for  its  automatic 
conversion  function,  which  erroneously  changes  tens  of 
human gene symbols [4]. But, the errors are not limited to 
gene symbols and may occur in the clinical information, as 

well.

Age  and  gender  are  some  of  the  most  basic  clinical 
information associated with human samples and are most 
unlikely to be erroneous during data acquisition. While they 
are  basic  clinical  information,  the  importance  of  age  and 
gender  in  human  biology  is  not  trivial.  There  is  strong 
evidence that men and women differ in terms of develop-
ment  and  severity  of  many  common  diseases,  including 
cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and asthma 
[5].  Recent  clinical  studies  have  revealed  an  association 
between several genetic diseases and gender-specific genetic 
patterns [6, 7].

While analyzing public datasets produced using Infinium 
450K HumanMethylation arrays (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
CA, USA) and Affymetrix Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 
arrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), we found 
many samples that were discordant between clinical gender 
information  and  the  patterns  of  gender-specific  markers. 
Importantly, the errors were not limited to a few datasets but

were prevalent in many datasets produced by many different 
laboratories.  We  advise  that  the  users  of  public  datasets 
should  not  expect  that  these  data  are  error-free  and, 
whenever possible, that they check the consistency of data.

Methods
Data collection and processing

Infinium 450K HumanMethylation array
More than 5,600 samples from 11 datasets were collected 
from GEO [2]. Before data integration, we calculated the 
average beta value for measuring methylation levels at each 
CpG  site,  ranging  from  0  (least  methylated)  to  1  (most 
methylated). The individual beta value was dropped if the 
detection p-value was over 0.05. For all datasets, raw signal 
intensity files were collected, and from them, methylation 
level was calculated as β = (max(Cy5, 0)) / (|Cy3| ＋ |Cy5| 
＋ 100). A constant of 100 was added to the denominator to 
regularize β values when both unmethylated and methylated 
intensities were small.

Affymetrix U133Plus2 array
A  total  of  1,819  samples  from  4  datasets  for  gene 
expression  experiments  using  the  Affymetrix  U133Plus2 
array were obtained from GEO [2]. For all datasets, CEL files 
were collected and normalized by Robust Multiarray Average 
method [8].

Selection of gender-specific DNA methylation and 
gene expression markers

The gender-specific DNA methylation markers of the X 
chromosome  were  selected 
from  reported  X-linked 
housekeeping  genes  [9].  The  gender-specific  DNA 
methylation markers of the Y chromosome were estimated 
using differentially methylated CpG sites in Y chromosomes 
between  males  and  females  (Supplementary  Fig.  1). 
Gender-specific markers were selected based on their beta 
value distribution in both males and females. As a result, two 
markers (cg24139739 and cg02869694) were selected as X 
chromosome markers, and two markers (cg07851521 and 
cg10835413) were selected as Y chromosome markers. The 
cutoff  values  for  each  marker  were  cg24139739  ＜ 0.25, 
cg02869694 ＜ 0.4, cg07851521 ＞ 0.5, and cg10835413 ＞ 
0.45 (Supplementary Fig. 1).

The  gender-specific  gene  expression  markers  were 
selected  from  reported  gender-specific  gene  expression 
patterns in human blood (Supplementary Fig. 2) in a similar 
way [10]. Two markers (214218_s_at and 224588_at) were 
selected  as  X  chromosome  markers,  and  two  markers 
(204409_s_at and 205000_at) were selected as Y chromo-
some  markers.  The  cutoff  values  for  each  marker  were 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

214218_s_at ＜ 4.5, 224588_at ＜ 7.5, 204409_s_at ＞ 5, and 
205000_at ＞ 5. 

Data analysis

Python  version  2.7.6  and  the  Pandas  python  library 
version 0.15.2 were used for most data analyses. R version 
3.1.0  and  ggplot2  version  1.0.0  were  used  for  image 
production.

Results
Collection of DNA methylation array data of human 
whole blood with age and gender information

We obtained DNA methylation microarray data from the 
NCBI  GEO  database  (Fig.  1).  We  collected  datasets  of 
normal human blood samples in which both age and gender 
data were available. As a result, we collected a total of 4,862 
samples for Infinium 450K HumanMethylation array data 
(Table 1).

Determination of gender by gender-specific markers

The  CpG  sites  of  X  chromosomes  in  females  are 
hypermethylated  for  dosage  compensation  of  female  X 
chromosomes  [11].  By  analyzing  female-specific  hyper-
methylated  genes  in  the  X  chromosome  (Supplementary

Table  1), we  identified 19 samples (0.39%)  in which  the 
methylation patterns of gender-specific CpG markers did not 
match  the given gender information (Fig. 2A).  When we 
analyzed those samples with male-specific hypermethylated 
genes in the Y chromosome (Supplementary Table 2), we 
again observed the opposite methylation patterns (Fig. 2B). 
Importantly, the discordant patterns were observed in eight 
of 11 datasets from different depositors, suggesting that the 
errors were not limited to one laboratory (Supplementary 
Fig. 3).

Interestingly, we found both types of discordant errors 
between  DNA  methylation  patterns  and  given  gender 
information. That is, for some samples, DNA methylation 
patterns were found to be female-specific while they were 
designated as males (designated here as discordant-male), 
and for the other samples, DNA methylation patterns were 
male-specific  while  they  were  designated  as  female 
(designated here as discordant-female).

Analysis of markers of chromosome abnormality 
syndromes

We  next  analyzed  whether  the  observed  discrepancy 
between methylation patterns of gender-specific genes and 
the given clinical information could be explained by rare sex 
chromosome abnormality syndromes, such as Turner and 

Klinefelter syndromes.

While a normal male inherits an X chromosome and a Y 
chromosome  and  a  normal  female  inherits  two  X 
chromosomes, several abnormalities in the number of sex 
chromosomes  occur  gender-specifically.  For 
females, 
abnormalities are a result of variations in the number of X 
chromosomes. For males, abnormalities are due to irregular 
numbers  of  the  X  or  Y  chromosome  or  both.  The  most 
frequent  sex  chromosome  abnormalities  in  females  are 
Turner (one X; 1:2,000) and triple X (XXX; 1:1,000), while 
those  in  males  are  Klinefelter  (XXY;  1:500)  and  XYY 
(1:1,000) syndromes [12-15].

For  comparison,  we  collected  Infinium  450K  Human-
Methylation array data of one Turner syndrome patient and 
five  Klinefelter  syndrome  patients.  The  characteristic 
methylation  pattern  of  Turner  syndrome  (one  X)  is  the 
hypomethylation of both X- and Y-specific markers (Fig. 3A). 
However, we found that most discordant-female samples in 
our dataset showed hypermethylation patterns in Y-specific 
markers,  suggesting  that  they  had  XY  chromosomes  (a 
normal male) but not X (Turner syndrome) chromosome 
(Fig. 3A). Only one discordant-female sample (green circle 
in Fig. 2A) showed a pattern similar to Turner syndrome. For 
Klinefelter  syndrome  (XXY),  the  expected  methylation 
patterns  are  the  hypermethylation  of  both  male-  and

calculator, a web-based tool that provides a predicted age 
based  on  the  methylation  values  of  DNA  methylation 
markers  of  Illumina’s  Infinium  platform  [18].  When  we 
compared the absolute age deviation between concordant 
and discordant samples, we found much larger deviations in 
age  prediction  among  discordant  samples  compared  with 
concordant samples (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5). This 
result suggests that the discordant samples are highly likely 
to have errors both in age and gender information, a scenario 
that occurs when two samples are mislabeled as each other.

Identification of gender-discordant samples from 
the analysis of gender-specific gene expression

To see if the same problem occurs in other types of data 
(e.g.,  gene  expression),  we  collected  gene  expression 
microarray data from the NCBI GEO database using a similar 
strategy for methylation microarray data (Fig. 4). By applying 
the  same  criteria  as  with  the  DNA  methylation  data,  we 
collected a total of 1,683 samples from 4 datasets produced 
using the Affymetrix U133Plus2 array platform (Table 2).

We  analyzed  the  1,683  samples  using  several  gender- 
specific  genes  (X  (inactive)-specific  transcript  [XIST], 
eukaryotic  translation 
factor  1A,  Y-linked 
[EIF1AY], and DEAD [Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp] box polypeptide 3, 
Y-linked [DDDX3Y]) [10] and found that 40 samples (2.3%) 
from 3 datasets were erroneously described (Fig. 5). In the 
case  of  Y  chromosome  markers,  some  discordant  male

female-specific markers. We observed one discordant-male 
sample  in  which  both  male-  and  female-specific  markers 
were  hypermethylated  (red  circles  in  Figs.  2B  and  3A). 
However, a close examination of three Klinefelter syndrome- 
specific  markers  revealed  that  the  one  discordant-male 
sample did not show the patterns of a Klinefelter syndrome 
patient (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. 4) [16]. In conclusion, 
only one sample showed a methylation pattern associated 
with sex chromosome abnormalities.

Significant difference between clinical age 
information and predicted age using a DNA 
methylation age calculator

Recently,  several  studies  have  shown  that  DNA 
methylation markers can be used to estimate the age of an 
individual  to  within  5  y  [17].  Because  the  datasets  we 
analyzed had age information, as well, we tested whether the 
given age information deviated much from the estimated age 
from  age-specific  DNA  methylation  markers.  The  age 
prediction was performed by using the DNA methylation age

needed to be compared samples with male sex abnormality

we  could  not  find  datasets  with  male  sex  abnormality 
syndromes produced using the same platform. However, as

some markers, we considered them to be putative discordant 
samples. But, further validation will be needed to confirm 
these samples.

Unlike  the  previous  methylation  data,  some  of  the 
collected  gene  expression  datasets  contained  technical 
replicates  of  the  same  samples  (Table  2).  Surprisingly, 
discordant  gender-specific  expression  patterns  were  even

Discussion

Recently, genomewide omics data have accumulated very 
fast due to advances in omics technologies (e.g., Illumina's 
Infinium methylation assay and next-generation sequencing). 
Now, researchers can exploit public data repositories (e.g., 
ArrayExpress [3] and GEO [2]) that store data of hundreds 
of thousands of samples with both genomewide profiling 
data  and  associated  clinical  information.  However,  as  we 
have shown here, datasets are not error-free, and any type of 
error  can  occur  in  public  datasets.  Indeed,  one  paper 
reported that the aggregate mislabeled blood sample rate 
was 1.12% at various US institutions in 2013 [19]. Possibly, 
various kinds of errors (e.g., mislabeling of tubes, mixing of 
samples)  may  occur  from  sample  preparation  to  various 
steps of the experimental procedures. 

When we began the analysis of Infinium 450K Human-
Methylation array data, we did not expect errors in gender 
description to occur so often in several datasets. We thus 
analyzed  if  those  erroneous  samples  showed  the  methy-
lation patterns of gender-specific chromosome abnormality 
syndromes  (e.g.,  Turner  and  Klinefelter  syndromes)  but 
found that most of the erroneous samples did not. Thus, we 
concluded that most discordant samples were real human 
errors. This finding led us to analyze expression datasets of 
Affymetrix  U133Plus2  array  data,  as  well,  and  again,  we 
found  that  errors  were  not  rare  as  well.  Fortunately,  for 
transcriptomic  and  epigenomic  datasets,  gender-specific 
markers (Supplementary Tables 1–4) are well known, so that 
researchers can check whether the given gender information 
is concordant with the expected patterns of gender-specific 
markers.  For  DNA  methylation,  a  user-friendly  website 
(https://dnamage.genetics.ucla.edu/) [18] is also available 
for researchers.

In conclusion, we suggest that users of public data should 
not  expect  that  the  data  are  error-free,  and  whenever 
possible, they should check them carefully before use.
