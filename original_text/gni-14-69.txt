This  is  a  special  issue,  consisting  of  three  selected 
dissertations that were awarded the KOGO Young Scientist 
Best  Paper  Award,  hosted  by  KOGO  (Korea  Genome 
Organization) in 2016. A dissertation (Seungkyu Choi et al.) 
on analyzing the mutational profiles of extranodal NK/T-cell 
lymphoma  (NKTCL)  using  targeted  sequencing  with  a 
comprehensive cancer panel revealed that KMT2D is a novel 
driver gene in NKTCL. 

The second paper that was awarded (Ki-Sung Kwon et al.) 
describes  the  recapitulation  of  candidate  systemic  lupus 
erythematosus-associated variants in Koreans. In this study, 
the  authors  aimed  to  replicate  SNPs  that  were  recently 
discovered in a GWAS but have not been validated in Koreans 
or have only been replicated in Koreans with an insufficient 
sample size to conclude any association. 

Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segment (Numt) insertion 
describes a well-known phenomenon of mitochondrial DNA 
transfer into a eukaryotic nuclear genome. However, it has 
not  been  well  understood,  especially  in  plants.  Numt 
insertion patterns vary from species to species in different 

kingdoms. In the third paper that was awarded (Young-Joon 
Ko  and  Sangsoo  Kim),  the  authors  analyzed  nuclear 
mitochondrial DNA segments of nine plant species. 

Transposable elements are one of the major sources of 
genomic instability through various mechanisms, including 
de novo insertion, insertion-mediated genomic deletion, and 
recombination-associated genomic deletion. Among them, 
Alu is the most abundant element, constituting ∼10% of the 
human  genome.  In  this  issue,  Dr.  Jungnam  Lee’s  group 
(University of Florida, USA) comprehensively reviewed the 
mechanisms of Alu amplification and their roles in generating 
genomic rearrangements, as well as human genetic disorders.
The other four papers are about the virtual screening of 
natural inhibitors against influenza A (H1N1) neuraminidase 
protein and potential inhibitors of NS3 protein of Zika virus, 
in  silico  prediction  of  miRNA-based  gene  regulation  in 
diverse cancers, and the identification of potential virulence 
factors of Helicobacter pylori.
