Abstract

Recently,  the  technologies  of  DNA  sequence  variation 
and  gene  expression  profiling  have  been  used  widely  as 
approaches  in  the  expertise  of  genome  biology  and 
genetics.  The  application  to  genome  study  has  been 
particularly  developed  with  the  introduction  of  the  next- 
generation DNA sequencer (NGS) Roche/454 and Illumina/ 
Solexa  systems,  along  with  bioinformation  analysis  tech-
nologies  of  whole-genome de novo assembly,  expression 
profiling,  DNA  variation  discovery,  and  genotyping.  Both 
massive  whole-genome  shotgun  paired-end  sequencing 
and  mate  paired-end  sequencing  data  are  important 
steps  for  constructing  de novo assembly  of  novel  ge-
nome  sequencing  data.  It  is  necessary  to  have  DNA  se-
quence  information  from  a  multiplatform  NGS  with  at 
least  2×  and  30×  depth  sequence  of  genome  coverage 
using  Roche/454  and  Illumina/Solexa,  respectively,  for 
effective  an  way  of  de novo assembly.  Massive  short- 
length  reading  data  from  the  Illumina/Solexa  system  is 
enough  to  discover  DNA  variation,  resulting  in  reducing 
the  cost  of  DNA  sequencing.  Whole-genome  expression 
profile  data  are  useful  to  approach  genome  system  bio-
logy  with  quantification  of  expressed  RNAs  from  a  whole- 
genome  transcriptome,  depending  on  the  tissue  sam-

ples.  The  hybrid  mRNA  sequences  from  Rohce/454  and 
Illumina/Solexa  are  more  powerful  to  find  novel  genes 
through  de novo assembly  in  any  whole-genome  se-
quenced  species.  The  20×  and  50×  coverage  of  the 
estimated  transcriptome  sequences  using  Roche/454 
and  Illumina/Solexa,  respectively,  is  effective  to  create 
novel  expressed  reference  sequences.  However,  only  an 
average  30×  coverage  of  a  transcriptome  with  short 
read  sequences  of  Illumina/Solexa  is  enough  to  check 
expression  quantification,  compared  to  the  reference  ex-
pressed  sequence  tag  sequence.

Introduction

Scientists  have  tried  to  understand  biology  through  DNA 
sequence  information,  since  the  DNA  is  verified  as  the 
unit  of  genetic  heredity.  Also,  scientists  hope  to  dramati-
cally  reduce  the  cost  of  reading  genomic  DNA  and  to 
obtain  the  high-throughput  DNA  sequence  information. 
Since  the  automated  DNA  sequencers  were  developed 
with  fluorescent  dyes  of  different  colors,  laser,  and  com-
puter  technology  in  the  1980s,  the  human  genome  proj-
ect  (HGP)  was  begun  in  1990,  and  the  human  genome 
was  completely  released  in  2003,  while  further  analysis 
is  still  being  published.  A  total  of  about  3  billion  dollars 
was  invested  to  the  project.  In  1991,  the  National  Human 
Genome  Research  Institute  (NHGRI)  funds  were  geared 
toward  lowering  the  cost  of  DNA  sequencing.  Some  of 
technologies  invested  improved  the  DNA  sequencing.  To 
date,  the  Applied  Biosystems,  Roche/454,  and  Illumina/ 
Solexa  have  successfully  developed  their  technology 
and  applied  DNA  sequencing  in  the  world  during  the  re-
cent  6  years.  Most  of  the  newest  technologies  currently 
in  use  generate  sequences  from  36  to  1,000  base  pairs, 
which  requires  special  software  for  different  applications, 
including  whole-genome  sequencing,  transcriptome  ana-
lysis,  and  regulatory  gene  analysis.  In  particular, in silico 
method  development  using  bioinformation  software  for 
next-generation  sequence  assembly  would  be  alert  for 
many  genome  projects  and  more  applications  in  genome 
biology.  Particularly,  many  biologists  and  geneticists  us-
ing  massive  DNA  and  RNA  sequences  have  used  the 
sequencing  applications  focused  on  the  variable  research 
fields  in  medicine,  such  as  improved  diagnosis  of  dis-
ease;  gene  therapy;  control  systems  for  drugs,  including

pharmacogenomics  “custom  drugs;”  evolution;  bioenergy 
and  environmental  applications  of  creative  energy  sour-
ces  (biofuels);  clean  up  of  toxic  wastes,  including  effi-
cient  environmental  sources  against  carbon;  and  agri-
culture  projects,  including  livestock  of  healthier,  more 
productive,  disease-resistant  farm  animals  and  breeding 
of  disease-,  insect-,  and  drought-resistant  crops.  In  this 
paper,  we  report  several  ways  of  genome  sequencing 
and  expression  profiling  in  genome  biology.

Current  Next-generation  Sequencing  (NGS) 
Technology

Roche/454  pyrosequencing  technology

The  first  high-parallel  sequencing  system  was  developed 
with  an  emulsion  PCR  method  for  DNA  amplification 
and  an  instrument  for  sequencing  by  synthesis  using  a 
pyrosequencing  protocol  optimized  on  the  individual  well 
of  a  PicoTiterPlate  (PTP)  [1].  The  DNA  sequencing  pro-
tocol,  including  sample  preparation,  is  supplied  for  a 
user  to  follow  the  method,  which  is  developed  by  454 
Life  Science  (now  part  of  Roche  Diagnostics,  Mannheim, 
Germany).  Even  following  the  manufacturer’s  protocol, 
to  obtain  high-quality  DNA  sequence  with  maximal  total 
DNA  sequence  length  as  possible,  one  should  make  a 
library  with  both  adapters  on  the  sheared  DNA  fragment 
and  mix  the  optical  ratio  of  library  DNA  versus  bead  for 
emulsion  PCR.  Now,  the  system  is  upgraded  to  through-
put  a  total  of  an  average  of  700  Mbp  with  an  average 
600  bp/read  in  one  PTP  run.  The  sequencer  is  available 
for  single  reads  and  paired-end  read  sequencing  for  the 
application  of  eukaryotic  and  prokaryotic  whole-genome 
sequencing  [2,  3],  metagenomics  and  microbial  diversity 
[4,  5],  and  genetic  variation  detection  for  comparative 
genomics  [6].

Illumina/Solexa  technology

The  numerous  cost-effective  technologies  were  being 
developed  for  human  genome  resequencing  that  can  be 
aligned  to  the  reference  sequence  [7,  8].  The  first  suc-
cessful  technology  to  gain  massive  DNA  sequencing 
available  for  resequencing  was  developed  by  Solexa 
(now  part  of  Illumina,  San  Diego,  CA,  USA).  The  princi-
ple  of  the  system  is  the  method  of  base-by-base  se-
quencing  by  synthesis,  where  the  sheared  template  DNA 
is  amplified  on  the  flat  surface  slide  (flow  cell)  and  de-
tects  one  base  on  each  template  per  cycle  with  four 
base-specific,  fluorescently  labeled  signals.  Signals  for 
all  four  fluorescent  channels  are  collected  and  plotted  at 
each  position,  enabling  quality  per  scores  to  be  derived 
using  four-color  information  if  desired  [8].  Now,  a  max-

imum  of  300  Gb  for  reading  is  available  with  101  bp 
paired-end  reading  per  fragment  on  a  1-flow  cell  run  in 
the  upgraded  HiSeq  system.

Application  of  NGS  to  Genome  Research

Novel  whole  genome  de novo assembly

More  than  11,000  sequencing  projects,  including  tar-
geted  projects,  were  reported  on  the  Genome  Online 
Database  (GOLD,  http://www.genomesonline.org)  in  ear-
ly  2012.  Now,  more  than  3,000  genome  projects  have 
been  completed  on  the  diverse  genome  species,  and 
more  than  90%  of  completed  projects  were  bacterial 
genome  sequencing.  The  greatest  bacterial  genome  se-
quencing  was  performed  with  454  pyrosequencing  be-
cause  of  the  available  largest  long  read  sequencing, 
useful  for de novo assembly  of  novel  genome  sequen-
cing.  The  official  depth  of  the  deep  sequencing  strategy 
of  454  pyrosequencing  technology  for  whole  bacterial 
genome  sequencing  for de novo  assembly  in  novel  ge-
nome  sequencing  is  at  least  15-20×  in  depth  of  the  es-
timated  genome  size  [9-13].  However,  Li  et al.  [3]  re-
ported  that  6-10×  sequencing  in  qualified  runs  with 
500-bp  reads  would  be  enough  for de novo  assemblies 
from  1,480  prokaryote  genomes  with  ＞98%  genome 
coverage,  ＜100  contigs  with  N50,  and  size  ＞100  kb. 
Recently,  prokaryote  whole  genome  sequencing  using 
101  bp  paired-end  read  data  from  Illumina/Solexa  sys-
tems  was  used  for de novo assembly  and  resequencing. 
For  example,  a Bacillus subtilis subspecies  genome  se-
quence  was  generated  by  using  the  short  read  sequence 
from  Illumina/Solexa  and  assembled  with  the  Velvet  pro-
gram  [14].  In  this  case,  the  genome  assembly  was  com-
pleted,  based  on  the  reference  genome  for  ordering  the 
numerous  contigs  derived  from de novo assembly.  Even 
though  numerous  contigs  assembled  with  Illumina/Solexa 
data  were  produced  in  the  eukaryotic  genome,  a  few 
drafts  for  the  assembled  genome  sequence  were  re-
ported,  except  for  the  giant  panda  genome  [15],  which 
was  covered  with  assembled  contigs  (2.25  Gb),  covering 
approximately  94%  of  the  expected  whole  genome. 
Another  example  was  the  woodland  strawberry  genome 
(240  Mb)  [16]  that  was  sequenced  to  39×  depth  of  the 
genome,  assembled de novo,  and  anchored  to  the  link-
age  map  of  seven  pseudochromosomes. 
    The  genome  sequence  could  be  associated  with  the 
predicted  genes  with  transcriptome  sequence  data.  An 
ideal  method  for  cost-effective  novel  genome  sequenc-
ing  using  NGS  is de novo assembly  with  diverse  shot-
gun  fragment  end  sequencing  data  of  multiplat  systems 
(Fig.  1).  The  first  strategy  of  novel  genome  DNA  sequen-
cing  is  sequencing  the  genomic  DNA  for  contig  and  scaf-

which  are  made  with  the  average  range  of  200-800-bp  fragments  for  Roche/454  or  Illumina/Solexa  systems.  In  general,  pro-
ducing  a  total  DNA  sequence  amount  of  15-20×  and  60×  coverage  in  depth  of  a  genome  depends  on  using  Roche/454  or
Illumina/Solexa,  respectively.  Whole-genome  shotgun  mate  paired-end  sequencing  for  scaffold  construction  (right  of  the

software. Recently, a catfish genome was sequenced with 
multiplatform  Roche/454  and  Illumina/Solexa  technology 
and  assembled  with  an  effective  combination  of  low 
coverage  depth  of  18×  Roche/454  and  70×  Illumina/ 
Solexa  data  using  3  assembly  softwares  -  Newbler  soft-
ware  to  the  454  reads,  Velvet  assembler  to  the  Illumina 
read,  and  MIRA  assembler  for  final  assembly  of  contigs 
and  singletons  derived  from  initial  assembled  data  -  re-
sulting  in  193  contigs  with  an  N50  value  of  13,123  bp 
[2].  In  an  additional  multiplatform  data  assembly  of  a 
40-Mb  eukaryotic  genome  of  the  fungus Sordaria mac-
rospra,  a  combination  sequence  of  85-fold  coverage  of 
Illumina/Solexa  and  10-fold  coverage  by  Roche/454  se-
quencing  was  assembled  to  a  40-Mb  draft  version  (N50 
of  117  kb)  with  the  Velvet  assembler  as  a  reference  of 

a  model  organism  for  fungal  morphogenesis  [17].  In  the 
recent  effective  assembly  methods  reported,  combina-
tions  of  the  multiplatform  sequence  are  shown  as  suc-
cessful  novel  genome  assembly  using  variable  assembly 
strategy  pipelines.  Comparing  the  pipeline  of  assembly 
strategy,  we  suggest  an  effective  integrated  pipeline  in 
which  data  are  filtered  to  remove  low-quality  and  short- 
read  initial  assemblies  using  variable  software  and  then 
compared  to  contigs,  hybrid  contigs  using  MIRA  assem-
bler,  and  finally  contig  orders  using  SSPACE  software 
(http://www.baseclear.com/dna-sequencing/data-analysis/) 
[18]  for  scaffold  construction  through de novo assembly 
of  novel  genome  sequencing  (Fig.  2).  According  to  the 
comparison  of  several  ways  of  de novo assembly,  we 
suggest  using  both  DNA  sequences  from  multiplatform 
NGS  with  at  least  2×  and  30×  depth  sequences  of  ge-
nome  coverage  using  Roche/454  and  Illumina/Solexa, 
respectively,  and  doing  hybrid  assembly  for  cost-effec-
tive  novel  genome  sequencing.

SNP discovery and genotyping with resequencing

Resequencing  of  genomic  regions  or  target  genes  of  in-
terest  in  a  phenotype  is  the  first  step  in  the  detection 
of  DNA  variations  associated  with  the  gene  regulation. 
The  discovery  of  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs) 
including  insertion/deletions  (indels),  with  high-throughput 
data  is  useful  to  study  genetic  variation,  comparative 
genomics,  linkage  map,  and  genomic  selection  for 
breeding  value  with  DNA  variation.  Many  geneticists  for 
biological  and  genome  studies  of  microbial,  plant,  ani-
mal,  and  human  genomes  have  effectively  used  NGS 
whole-genome  resequencing  data  to  use  in  variable  re-
search  fields,  such  as  bacterial  evolution  [19],  genome-
wide  analysis  of  mutagenesis  of Escherichia coli strains 
[20],  comparative  genomics  of  Streptococcus suis of 
swine  pathogen  [21],  genomic  variation  effects  on  phe-
notype  and  gene  regulation  in  mouse  [22],  evolution  of 
plant  [23],  and  comparison  of  genetic  variations  on  the 
targeted  enrichment  [24].  The  platforms  of  resequencing 
projects  have  used  Illumina/Solexa  of  short  read  lengths 
to  align  with  the  reference  sequence  to  discover  DNA 
variations  between  compared  related  species’  sequen-
ces.  Because  of  rare  occurrence  of  SNPs  in  most  spe-
cies,  it  is  important  to  identify  high-accuracy  data  to  dis-
cover  DNA  variations  according  to  coverage  depth  using 
MAQ  (http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml)  [25]  and 
CLC  software  (http://www.clcbio.com).  The  public  proto-
col  of  covering  depth  to  discover  SNPs  and  indels  on 
the  heterogeneous  genome  requires  at  least  30×  of  the 
reference  genome,  while  about  10×  depth  of  coverage 
is  enough  for  DNA  variation  study  of  homogeneous 
genomes.  Of  course,  high  coverage  of  depth  provides 

high-quality  data  in  SNP  detection  on  the  reference 
mapping  (Fig.  3).  However,  short  read  lengths  of  35  bp 
or  100  bp  show  enough  to  map  on  the  reference  se-
quence  using  the  MAQ  software  and  CLC  software  in 
the  genome,  including  short  repeated  block  regions. 
But,  geneticists  still  require  long-read  sequencing  data 
to  distinguish  repeated  block  regions,  like  paralogous 
regions  derived  from  gene  duplication.  MAQ  software 
provides  a  consensus  sequence  of  the  genotype  se-
quenced  of  short  read  lengths  with  aligned  raw  reads  to 
the  reference  sequence.  CLC  software  checks  accuracy 
by  counting  reads  of  DNA  variations  of  each  position. 
Recently,  a  novel  application  of  pattern  recognition  for 
accurate  DNA  variations  was  discovered  in  the  com-
plexity  of  the  genomic  region  using  high-throughput  da-
ta  in  a  Caucasian  population  [26].  They  used  three  in-
dependent  datasets  with  Sanger  sequencing  and  Affy-
metrix  and  Illumina  microarrays  to  validate  SNPs  and  in-
dels  of  a  clinical  target  region,  FKBP5.  Therefore,  it  is 
necessary  for  multiplatform  systems  to  validate  DNA 
variations  in  the  specific  complexity  of  the  genome 
region.

Expression  profiling

Gene  expression  profiling  is  a  measurement  of  the  regu-
lation  of  a  transcriptome  from  the  whole  genome  in  the 
field  of  molecular  biology.  A  conventional  method  to 
measure  the  relative  activity  of  target  genes  is  DNA  mi-
croarray  technology,  which  estimates  expressed  genes 
with  the  signals  of  hybridization  of  target  genes  (cDNA 
from  mRNA)  on  the  synthesized  oligonucleotides  [27]. 
The  technology  is  still  used  for  functional  genomics  in

is  useful 

the  wide  era,  including  medicine,  clinic,  plant,  and  agri-
cultural  biotechnology  [28-30].  In  addition,  microarray 
technology  is  also  used  in  the  comparative  study  of 
proteomics  and  expression,  measuring  the  level  of  ex-
tracellular  matrix  protein  [30].  Since  NGS  technology  was 
developed  in  2005,  the  transcriptome  of  novel  whole  ge-
nomes  could  be  identified  with  massive  parallel  mRNA 
sequencing  using  Roche/454  and  Illumina/Solexa  [31-36]. 
The  Roche/454  system  is  more  useful  for  gaining  novel 
gene  discovery  of  novel  species’  genomes  for  long  read 
sequencing  [37,  38].  Otherwise,  Illumina/Solexa  is  being 
used  to  profile  the  expression  of  known  genes  with 
mapping  short  read  sequences  to  the  known  reference 
genes  [39,  40].  In  that  case,  rare  expressed  genes  and 
novel  genes  could  be  identified  with  high-throughput  ex-
pressed  sequence  tag  sequences  using  Illumina/Solexa. 
Also,  it  is  useful  to  find  significant  tissue-specific  ex-
pression  biases  with  comparison  of  transcript  data  [22]. 
Now,  the  hybrid  mRNA  sequence  from  Rohce/454  and 
Illumina/Solexa  is  more  powerful  for  finding  novel  genes 
through  de novo assembly  in  any  whole-genome  spe-
cies. 
    The  hybrid  sequence  data  of  20×  and  50×  coverage 
of  the  estimated  transcriptome  sequence  from  Roche/ 
454  and  Illumina/Solexa,  respectively,  is  effective  in  cre-
ating  novel  expressed  reference  sequences,  while  short- 
read  Illumina/Solexa  data  are  cost-efficient  on  expres-

sion  quantification  information  for  comparing  exposed 
samples  and  natural  phenotype  samples  through  map-
ping  to  the  reference  genes  (Fig.  4).  Only  and  average 
30×  coverage  of  transcriptome  depth  of  short-read  se-
quences  of  Illumina/Solexa  is  enough  to  check  expres-
sion  quantification,  compared  to  reference  expressed 
sequence  tag  sequences.  The  expressed  information 
could  be  different,  depending  on  the  software  using 
CAP3,  MIRA,  Newbler,  SeqMan,  and  CLC.  Therefore,  the 
results  should  be  compared  according  to  variable  pro-
gram  options  to  define  robust  expression  profiling  [41]. 
To  date,  a  powerful  tool  of  ChIP-on-chip  is  used  for  un-
derstanding  gene 
regulation.  Thus, 
two-channel  microarray  technology  of  a  combination  of 
chromatin  immunoprecipitation  could  be  used  for  ge-
nomewide  mapping  of  binding  sites  of  DNA-interacting 
proteins  [29].  In  any  NGS  application,  the  transcriptome 
expression  information  would  be  more  useful  than  com-
plete  genome  information  research  with  the  lowest  se-
quencing  budget  for  biologists  to  better  understand 
gene  regulation  of  related  genetic  phenotypes  with  the 
in silico method.  Of in silico methods,  conserved  miRNA 
and  novel  miRNA  discovery  is  available  on  the  massive 
miRNAnome  data  in  any  species.  Specially,  the  target 
genes  of  miRNA  discovered  could  be  robust  information 
to  approach  genome  biology  studies.  Transcriptome  as-
sembly  is  smaller  than  genome  assembly  and  thus

harder,  as  individual  contigs  can  often  have  highly  varia-

Newbler  2.5  performed  the  best  on  our  trial  dataset,  but 
other  assemblers  were  closely  comparable.  Combining 
different  optimal  assemblies  from  different  programs, 
however,  gives  a  more  credible  final  product,  and  this

Conclusion

NGS  technology  provides  a  cost-effective  way  of  se-
quencing  for  novel  whole-genome  sequencing,  resequen-
cing,  and  expression  profiling.  Rohce/454  pyrosequenc-
ing  is  recommended  to de novo assembly  of  whole  pro-
karyote  novel  genomes,  while  hybrid  assembly  with 
Illumina/Solexa  sequences  would  be  optimal  for  whole 
eukaryote  genomes  and  transcriptome  studies  of  non- 
model  organisms.  Also,  Illumina/Solexa  sequencing  is 
useful  in  detecting  DNA  variation,  mapping  the  short-read 
resequence  to  the  reference  genome  and  profiling  ex-
pressed  genes  in  model  organisms.  Furthermore,  the 
high-throughput  NGS  sequencing  enables  us  to  study 
with  an in silico method  in  variable  research  application 
fields  of  molecular  genetics,  including  population  diver-
