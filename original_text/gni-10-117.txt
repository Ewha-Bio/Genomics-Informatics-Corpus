A sample size with sufficient statistical power is critical to the success of genetic association studies to detect causal genes of 
human  complex  diseases.  Genome-wide  association  studies  require  much  larger  sample  sizes  to  achieve  an  adequate 
statistical power. We estimated the statistical power with increasing numbers of markers analyzed and compared the sample 
sizes  that  were  required  in  case-control  studies  and  case-parent  studies.  We  computed  the  effective  sample  size  and 
statistical power using Genetic Power Calculator. An analysis using a larger number of markers requires a larger sample size. 
Testing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker requires 248 cases, while testing 500,000 SNPs and 1 million markers 
requires 1,206 cases and 1,255 cases, respectively, under the assumption of an odds ratio of 2, 5% disease prevalence, 5% 
minor allele frequency, complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), 1：1 case/control ratio, and a 5% error rate in an allelic test. 
Under a dominant model, a smaller sample size is required to achieve 80% power than other genetic models. We found that 
a much lower sample size was required with a strong effect size, common SNP, and increased LD. In addition, studying a 
common disease in a case-control study of a 1：4 case-control ratio is one way to achieve higher statistical power. We also 

found that case-parent studies require more samples than case-control studies. Although we have not covered all plausible 
cases in study design, the estimates of sample size and statistical power computed under various assumptions in this study 
may be useful to determine the sample size in designing a population-based genetic association study.

Introduction

In genetic epidemiological research, both case-control and 
case-parent trio designs have been used widely to evaluate 
genetic  susceptibilities  to  human  complex  diseases  and 
markers, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 
to localize disease gene variants [1-5]. The sample size for 
detecting associations between disease and SNP markers is 
known to be highly affected by disease prevalence, disease 
allele  frequency,  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD),  inheritance 
models (e.g., additive, dominant, and multiplicative models), 
and  effect  size  of  the  genetic  variants  (e.g.,  odds  ratio, 
relative risk, etc.) [4, 6, 7]. Previous studies have shown that 
a population based case-control design can be more powerful 
than a family-based study design in identifying genes pre-
disposing human complex traits, both for qualitative traits 
and for quantitative traits [8-11]. However, some studies 

reported that the case-parent design is much more powerful 
than the case-control design in evaluating genetic risk for 
common complex diseases, because case-control studies are 
susceptible  to  bias  due  to  phenotype  misclassification  or 
population stratification [12, 13].

Recently,  genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs) 
using  thousands  of  cases  and  controls  reported  many 
susceptibility SNPs for 237 human traits by the end of June, 
2011  (www.genome.gov/GWAStudies).  Since  a  GWAS 
evaluates hundreds of thousands of SNP markers, it requires 
a much larger sample size to achieve an adequate statistical 
power [14-18]. In genetic association studies, the observed 
signal for association is referred to be statistically significant 
if the p-value is less than a preset threshold value (α) of 0.05 
to reject a null hypothesis of genetic association. Testing a 
large number of SNP markers leads to a large number of 
multiple comparisons and thus increases false positive rates.

EP  Hong  and  JW  Park.  Sample  Size  and  Statistical  Power  Calculations

Either the Bonferroni correction or the false discovery rate is 
generally applied to avoid false positive (type I error) rates. 
However, the Bonferroni-corrected p-value, the significance 
threshold set to 0.05 divided by the total number of SNPs 
analyzed in a GWAS, is too strict to consider the correlations 
among SNP markers (e.g., p = 1 × 10－7 for 500,000 (500 K) 
SNPs, p = 5 × 10－8 for 1 million (M) SNPs) [16, 19]. There-
fore, estimating a sufficient sample size to achieve adequate 
statistical  power  is  critical  in  the  design  stage  of  genetic 
association [20-24].

Statistical power is the probability to reject a null hypo-
thesis (H0) while the alternative hypothesis (HA) is true. It is 
affected by many factors. For instance, a larger sample size is 
required to achieve sufficient statistical power. Although a 
researcher collects a large number of samples, all samples 
may not be necessary to be analyzed to detect evidence for 
association.  A  large  sample  size  improves  the  ability  of 
disease prediction; however, it is not cost-effective that a 
researcher genotypes more than the effective sample size 
[25]. Unless researchers estimate sample size and statistical 
power at the research design stage, it leads to wasted time 
and resources to collect samples. An effective sample size 
can  be  defined  as  the  minimum  number  of  samples  that 
achieves adequate statistical power (e.g., 80% power). On 
the  other  hand,  too  small  a  sample  size  to  detect  true 
evidence for an association increases false negative rates and 
reduces the reliability of a study. False negative rates are 
increased by multiple factors that cause systematic biases, 
and such biases reduce statistical power [26]. The statistical 
power  of  80%  is  used  widely  to  avoid  false  negative 
associations and to determine a cost-effective sample size in 
large-scale association studies [7, 22, 23]. However, many 
researchers tend to overlook the importance of statistical 
power and sample size calculations.

In  this  study,  we  evaluated  statistical  power  with 
increasing  numbers  of  markers  analyzed  under  various 
assumptions  and  compared  the  sample  sizes  required  in 
case-control studies and case-parent studies.

Methods

We  computed  the  effective  sample  size  and  statistical 
power  using  a  web  browser  program,  Genetic  Power 
Calculator  developed  by  Purcell  et  al.  [27]  (http://pngu. 
mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/gpc/), for both case-control and 
case-parent studies. We conducted power and sample size 
calculations  under  various  assumptions  about  genetic 
models  (i.e.,  allelic,  additive,  dominant,  recessive,  and 
co-dominant  models),  minor  allele  frequencies  (MAFs), 
pair-wise LD, disease prevalence, case-to-control ratio, and 
number of SNP markers (i.e., single SNP, 500 K SNPs, and 1 

M  SNPs).  The  values  tested  for  heterozygous  odds  ratio 
(ORhet) were 1.3, 1.5, 2, and 2.5. The power and sample sizes 
were calculated under different ranges of factors, such as 
MAF of 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%; LD of 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1; 
disease  prevalence  of  0.01%,  0.1%,  5%,  and  10%;  and 
case-to-control  ratio  of  1：1,  1：2,  1：3,  and  1：4.  We 
assumed  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  at  the  disease-sus-
ceptible allele.

The Bonferroni p-value that was specific to the number of 
SNP makers tested was applied to cover 3 billion base pairs 
of the human genome (i.e., p = 0.05 for a single SNP marker, 
p = 1 × 10－7 for 500 K SNP markers, and p = 5 × 10－8 for 
1 M SNP markers). We fixed the proper range of sample sizes 
from 100 to 2,000 cases, because the power is too low when 
the sample size is below 100 cases (or trios), and the cost is 
too high to realistically collect samples when the sample size 
is above 2,000 [7, 22].

Results

We calculated the sample size to achieve 80% statistical 
power according to the genetic models and the heterozygous 
ORs using a single SNP marker in a case-control study under 
the  assumptions  of  5%  disease  prevalence,  5%  MAF, 
complete LD, 1：1 case-to-control ratio, and 5% type I error 
rate  (α)  (Table  1).  The  dominant  model  required  the 
smallest  sample  size  to  achieve  80%  power  compared  to 
other  genetic  models  (e.g.,  90  cases).  In  contrast,  the 
effective sample size to test a single SNP under the recessive 
model was too large to collect with a limited budget, even if 
the homozygous OR is greater than 4 (e.g., 1,536 cases). It 
reveals difficulty in detecting a disease allele that follows a 
recessive mode of inheritance with a moderate sample size.
The sample size and statistical power for the allelic test in 
a  case-control  study  under  the  different  assumptions  of 
ORhet,  MAF,  disease  prevalence,  LD,  and  case-to-control 
ratio by allowing a 5% type I error rate are shown in Fig. 1. As

A3=2,  and  A4=2.5  for  heterozygous  odds  ratios).

shown in Fig. 1A, a lower sample size was required to test 
allelic association for a single SNP with a larger MAF at the 
same  risk  of  disease  (OR)  under  the  assumptions  of  5% 
disease prevalence, 5% α, complete LD, and 1：1 case-to- 
control ratio. The minimum number of cases decreased from 
1,974 cases for a SNP with a MAF of 5% to 545 cases for a 
SNP  with  a  MAF  of  30%  under  the same  assumption.  A 
high-risk allele showing a high OR requires a smaller sample 
size to be detected under the same assumption. While an 
allele  with  an  OR  of  1.3  requires  1,974  cases  and  1,974 
controls to be significantly detected in a case-control study, 
a SNP with an OR of 2.5 can be detected in a study of 134 
cases and 134 controls under the assumption of a MAF of 
5%, disease prevalence of 5%, type I error rate of 5%, and D’ 
of 1 (Fig. 1A). The higher prevalence and the higher LD were 
associated with increased statistical power: for instance, as 
the LD increased from 0.4 to 0.6, 0.8, and 1, the statistical 

power  obtained  from  a  study  of  1,000  cases  and  1,000 
controls  was  obviously  increased  from  26.5%  to  49.2%, 
72.8%, and 88.4%, respectively, under the assumption of OR 
1.3, 5% MAF, 5% prevalence, and 5% α level (Fig. 1B and 
1C). In addition, a 1：4 case- to-control ratio, which is the 
golden standard ratio for the numbers of cases and controls 
to be collected in a case- control study, showed the most 
effective  sample  size  to  achieve  80%  statistical  power.  In 
many clinical settings, researchers are able to obtain more 
data from affected individuals than healthy individuals. On 
the  other  hand,  there  are  more  healthy  participants  than 
participants  with  a  disease  in  a  population-based  study. 
Therefore,  the  minimum  numbers  of  cases  and  controls 
required  to  achieve  80%  statistical  power  depend  on  the 
study design. For a SNP with an allelic OR of 2 and 5% MAF, 
127 cases and 508 controls are required in the case of a 1：4 
case-control ratio, whereas 248 cases and 248 controls are

required in the case of a 1：1 ratio to achieve 80% statistical 
power under the assumption of 5% prevalence, complete LD, 
and 5% α level.

In  Table  2,  we  compared  the  number  of  cases  to  the 
number of case-parent trios to perform a case-control study 
and a study using case-parent trios by increasing the number 
of SNPs  being  analyzed. Genetic association studies with 
larger numbers of SNP markers require a larger sample size 
to reduce false positive association due to testing multiple 
hypotheses. The sample size required in a case-parent study 
is generally larger than that of a case-control study design. 
For instance, 248 cases and 248 controls (496 individuals) 
were required to detect a SNP with an ORhet of 2 and 5% MAF 
in a case-control study, whereas 282 case-parent trios (846 
individuals)  were  required  under  the  assumption  of  5% 
disease prevalence and complete LD by allowing a 5% α level. 
However, the sample sizes required in both study designs 

increase  tremendously  in  a  GWAS.  Under  the  same 
assumptions  as  shown  above,  the  number  of  samples 
increased from 248 cases for a single SNP analysis to 1,206 
cases and 1,255 cases for analyses of 500 K SNPs and 1 M 
SNPs,  respectively,  based  on  the  threshold  of  p-value, 
calculated using a strict Bonferroni correction for multiple 
hypotheses comparisons. The statistical power to test the 
same  number of subjects was higher for  the case-control 
design than for the case-parent trio design (Fig. 2).

Discussion

Both designs of the case-control study and case-parent 
study are used widely in the field of genetic epidemiology for 
studying associations between genetic factors and the risk of 
disease.  Over  the  past  2  decades,  there  has  been  a  steep 
increase in the number of genetic association studies, and

these studies have successfully reported a number of gene 
variants associated with human complex diseases [1, 4, 5, 
28].  Recently,  GWASs,  a  new  frontier  in  genetic  epide-
miology,  have  identified  thousands  of  new  gene  variants 
related  to  human  diseases  [29].  The  population-based 
studies with a large sample size have increased statistical 
power, which leads to smaller variance. However, it requires 
too much money and takes too long to collect a sufficient 
number of samples, and these large-scale studies are more 
likely to be affected by systematic bias and noise [25, 30].

In  the  current  study,  we  demonstrated  the  effective 
sample  sizes  that  are  required  to  achieve  80%  statistical 
power  for  a  case-control  study  and  case-parent  study 
separately under various assumptions regarding effect size, 
MAF,  disease  prevalence,  LD,  case-to-control  ratio,  and 
number of SNPs. A lower sample size is required under the 
dominant  model  in  any  assumption,  while  the  recessive 
model  requires  too  many  samples  under  the  same 
assumptions to achieve adequate statistical power. Further, 
we confirmed that a lower sample size is required for testing 
more common SNPs with stronger effect sizes and increased 
LD between marker allele and disease allele. A lower sample 
size  is  required  to  study  a  common  disease  than  a  rare 
disease.  The  statistical  power  increases  by  increasing  the 
number of controls per case; however, a case-to-control ratio 
exceeding  1：4  does  not  yield  a  significant  increase  in 
statistical power. Among the parameters tested, under the 
assumption  of  a  high  level  of  LD  between  a  marker  and 
disease variant, a much reduced sample size is needed to 
detect evidence for association. Common variants are more 
informative  than  rare  variants  in  LD-based  indirect  asso-
ciation studies on complex diseases. It means that resear-
chers can reduce the cost by choosing common variants to be 
genotyped at the design stage of an LD-based association 
study.  In  general,  the  case-control  study  design  is  more 
powerful than the case-parent study design [8, 10]. Since 
patients with family histories of the disease are more likely 
to inherit disease-predisposing alleles than patients without 
family histories of the disease, researchers can improve the 
statistical power by sampling patients with affected relatives 
and by comparing to controls without any family history in 
case-control association studies [13].

Genome-wide  case-control  studies  have  been  used  to 
identify genetic variants that predispose to human disease 
with  model  assumptions  for  parameters,  such  as  the 
inheritance model. Such studies are powerful in detecting 
common variants with moderate effect in the occurrence of 
a  disease;  however,  a  study  with  a  large  number  of  SNP 
markers by using 500 K or 1 million chips requires a large 
number of samples (e.g., thousands of cases and controls) to 
achieve adequate statistical power. A researcher can rarely 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  2,  2012

successfully conduct a large-scale association study without 
collaboration using a high-throughput microarray chip, in 
which  most  embedded  SNPs  reveal  a  small  effect  size 
between 1.3 and 1.6 [31]. Therefore, researchers who are 
planning  a  genetic  association  study  must  calculate  the 
effective sample size and the statistical power in the design 
phase to perform a cost-effective study that reduces false 
negative and false positive test results. Although we could 
not  cover  all  plausible  conditions  in  study  design,  the 
estimates  of  sample  size  and  statistical  power  that  were 
computed under various assumptions in this study may be 
useful to determine the sample size in designing a popu-
lation-based association study.
