Introduction 
Chimpanzee  is  an  essential  organism  in  the  earth  to 
understand the  human  unique features,  such  as  highly 
developed cognitive functions, bipedalism and the use of 
complex language. Therefore,  a number of pilot studies 
comparing  the  human  and  chimpanzee  genome  have 
been  conducted to  understand the genetic basis of the 
unique features of humans,  although all  of their studies 
are  by  using  partial  genome  information  (Park  et a/., 
2000; King eta/., 1975; Fujiyama eta/., 2002; Olson eta/., 
2003; Boffelli eta/., 2003). The recently released human 
genome  sequences  provide  us  with  reference  data  to 
conduct comparative genomic research between human 
and  chimpanzee.  One  of pioneer group  in  this  field  is 
"The  International  Chimpanzee  Genome  Sequencing 
Consortium." The consortium was organized by 8 centers 
from  5 countries  at  13 March 2001  (Table  1 ).  This  is a 
review article of comparative genome analysis between 
human and chimpanzee which have been conducted by 
the consortium. 

Construction and Analysis of a Human(cid:173)
Chimpanzee Comparative Clone Map 
Our consortium already represented the construction and 
analysis of a first-generation human-chirrpanzee corrparative 
genomic map, which was an initial step for understanding 
the chimpanzee genome structure (Fujiyama eta/., 2002). 
The  map was constructed  through  paired  alignment 
of 77,461  chimpanzee  bacterial  artificial  chromosome 
end sequences (BES) information with publicly available

human genome sequences. The 77,461  BESs numbers 
are to have an alignment longer than 50 base pairs (bp) 
with  ::0:90%  identity.  Out  of this  number,  49,160  BESs 
from 24,580 clones formed paired ends where each pair 
was derived from the same clones.  Only one end could 
be  successfully  aligned  from  the  remaining  28,301 
clones.  The  remaining  36,960  BESs  that  were  not 
aligned with human genome were categorized into three 
different classes, repetitive sequences, matched to several 
species,  and  not  sequenced  human  region  or  lineage 
specific sequences. 

In this effort, 48.6% of the whole human genome was 
covered  by the chimpanzee  BACs,  the reasons for this 
apparently low coverage is that we used rather stringent 
conditions for the calculation,  and  probably the  human 
reference  data  was  draft  stage  at  that  time.  This 
probability can  be  proved  by the fact that the  coverage 
score was substantially higher for the chromosome  14, 
20, 21, and 22 was substantially higher, which have very 
high  quality  sequences.  Based  on  several  tests  to 
estimate  the  theoretical  coverage  with  the  human 
genome,  we  concluded  that  the  actual  coverage  is 
approximately 70% of the reference genome.  Relatively 
lower  coverage  of  chromosome  X  is  because  of  the 
haploid  status  of the  chromosome  in  the  chimpanzee 
BAC  libraries  which  was  constructed  from  the  male 
chimpanzee).  In  contrast,  theY chromosome coverage 
is  so  much  lower  (4.8%)  as  compared  with  the  other 
chromosomes.  One  of the  possible  explanation  is  that 
larger genome structure changes  have  occurred  in  the 
genome  structure  of Y chromosome  during  evolutional 
process. 

We  detected  the  boundaries  of  possible  genomic 
rearrangements  by  searching  for  candidate  clones 
containing chromosomal breakpoints using the mapping 
results.  One  of  samples,  PTB-053J22,  contained  the 
breakpoints corresponding to the human (or vice versa in

and 12q15. 

In addition, this region in human chromosome 12 or in 
chimpanzee chromosome 10 is known to be inverted in 
gorilla  and  chimpanzee  as  opposed  to  human  and 
orangutan.  The effect of genes orders  by the  inversion 
should be the target of future studies.

Comparative study between human-chimpanzee genome 
is an  essential research for narrowing down the genetic 
changes  which  affected  their  unique  features  from  a 
common ancestor in evolution process. Cytological evidence 
such  as  duplication,  translocations,  and  transpositions 
has been reported,  but owing to technological  limitation 
there is not an integrated picture of the dynamic changes 
of the genome {Thomas eta/., 2003). Therefore,  a gold 
standard is required to evaluate the overall consequence 
of these genetic changes on human evolution. To address 
these issues we have conducted  a human-chimpanzee 
whole-chromosome comparison at the nucleotide sequence 
level. 

Targeting  genome  was  human  chromosome  21 
(HSA21) which is the orthologue of chimpanzee chromosome 
22 (PTR22). HSA21 is one of the most well characterized 
genome  and  also  the  smallest  in  size  among  human 
chromosomes  (Hattori  et  a/.,  2000).  Moreover, 
in 
medical  implication of HSA21,  its genes involved  in  the 
chromosome are well  known to be  related  with  Down's 
syndrome (trisomy 21 ).  Interestingly, one case of trisomy 
22 in chimpanzee has been reported, which showed very 
similar  phenotypic feature  to  the  Down's  syndrome  of 
human (McClure eta/., 1969). Therefore, our analysis of 
these  chromosomes  should  reveal  dynamic  changes 
that  may  reflect  general  evolutionary  events  occurring 
throughout the human genome. 

Our  consortium  used  three  different  BAC  libraries 
from genomic DNA originated from three male chimpanzees 
(Pan  troglodytes).  After  constructing  high  resolution 
comparative BAC clone map, we divided sequencing region 
responsible to each sequencing centers. And we established 
common web site for organizing all the sequencing data 
and  communication  among  consortium  members.  Our 
basic policy for sequencing  data  management  was  not to 
release all the data before publishing the paper. 

Sequencing  coverage  of the  euchromatic portion  of 
the  long  arm  of  PTR  22  is  estimated  to  be  98.6% 
(PTR22/HSA21=32,799,845 bpi 33, 127,944), and sequencing 
accuracy was calculated as 99.9983% and :::>:99.9981% 

from  overlapping  clone  sequences  and  Phrap  scores, 
each other. 

The overall  structural  features  of PTR22  are almost 
the  same  as  those  of  HSA  21q.  However three  main 
different features  could  be found.  One  is  that  HSA21q 
was larger a roughly 400-kilobase (kb) or 1.2% difference 
in size than PTR 22, the difference of which is mainly due 
to interspersed repeats {ISRs) and simple repeats. This 
difference  can  mostly  be  explained  by  the  fact  that 
several  subfamilies  of transposable elements,  such  as 
L 1,  MER83R, AluYa5 and AluYb8 are more common  in 
human than in chimpanzee, and also five L TR subfamilies 
are more abundant in  HSA21q. 

The  second  is the pericentromeric copy of a 200-kb 
region found duplicated in HSA21  is missing in PTR22q. 
Finally,  one of the largest structural changes is a 54-kb 
region  located  11.4Mb from the centromere in HSA21q 
but  that  is  absent  in  PTR22.  We  also  detected  some 
interesting features that human-specific sequences are 
neither repetitive  nor low complexity and  are  unique  in 
the nr data set of NCB I, and that two large in del hotspots 
were found at around 9.5Mb-11.5Mb and  16.5Mb-17.5Mb 
from the centromere. 

The  overall  nucleotide  substitution  level  in  aligned 
regions  between  PTR22q  and  HSA21q  is  about 1.44% 
(excluding indel). The base substitution frequency showed 
almost same distribution along the chromosome, except 
for elevated regions in the pericentromeric and subtelomeric 
regions.  The  most conserved  region  was  at  about  the 
12.5-Mb region  (0.87% over  100 kb),  corresponding  to 
the  distal  boundary  region  of  the  gene  desert.  The 
correlation  between  the  G+C  content  and  the  base 
substitution  rate  increases  along  the  chromosome, 
especially high in the last 5Mb of the telomeric region of 
PTR22, and also base substitution in repetitive sequences 
also  tend  to  have  various  frequencies.  We  found  out

repetitive  sequences  indicating  evolutional  processing 
between  human and  chimpanzee that the last common 
ancestors are L 1 Hs, AluYa5 and AluYb8, and two elements 
to be integrated after speciation were AluYb9 and L 1 PA2. 
The  precise  identification  of  insertion  and  deletion 
(indel) in the two genomes is essential to understand the 
processes underlying human and chimpanzee evolution 
(Frazer eta/., 2003). We identified about 68,000 indels in 
total, and tested 567 indels larger than 300bp using DNA 
samples from human, chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan 
by PCR amplification. Then we were able to distinguish 
193 fragments which showed lineage-specific changes in 
size,  and  estimate the original  state of these regions in 
the  genome  of the  last  common  ancestor.  Insertions 
were mostly produced  by the  integration  of Alu  and  L 1 
elements, whereas deletions were not related to particular 
repetitive  structures.  An  interesting  difference between 
the  human  and  chimpanzee  genome  evolution  was 
newly  integrated  Alu  element,  which  is  inserted  in  the 
high  G+C  region  in  human whereas  in  the  low G+C in 
chimpanzee. Unlike the insertion, deletions do not correspond 
exactly  to  any  ISR  elements,  indicating  that  deletion 
events  are  independent  of  ISRs.  Calculation  result  of 
300-5000  bp  range  indel  suggested  that the  ancestral 
chromosome was larger than both HSA21 q and PTR22q. 
In  conclusion,  the expansion  of particular elements was 
repeated  several  times  during  the  course  of  evolution, 
and  also AluY elements  burst  might be contributed  the 
driving force for speciation between the human and the 
chimpanzee from the common ancestor. 

One of interesting question in this research should be 
how many different  genes exist  and  which  kind  of the 
genes  are  different  between  human  and  chimpanzee 
(Varki,  2000).  We  have  annotated  272  protein-coding 

genes and 89 pseudogenes in PTR22 by comparing with 
HSA21  (Table 2). Among the 231  genes associated to a 
canonical  ORF,  179 genes show a coding  sequence of 
identical  length in  human and chimpanzee, the average 
nucleotide and amino acid identity in the coding region is 
99.29% and 99.18%, respectively. Of these, 39 genes show 
an  identical  amino  acid  sequences,  other  genes  were 
different  in  more  than  one  amino  acid.  Especially,  47 
genes were significantly changed, and 5 chimpanzee genes 
were  unclassified  because  they  displayed  structural 
changes caused by indels (SH3BGR,  SYNJ1,  C21orf96 
and  TMPRSS3)  or  substitution  in  the  ATG  codon 
(C21orf18).  Six  HSA21q  genes  displaying  hallmark  of 
retro  genes  were  not  found  in  PTR22q  and  were 
probably  inserted  during  human  evolution  or  deleted 
during  chimpanzee  evolution  (Table  3).  Moreover,  we 
found out 5 probable genes to be changed in their function, 
one  ribosomal  protein  pseudogene,  and  four  coding 
sequences.  Our data  suggest that  indels within  coding 
regions represent one of the major mechanisms generating 
protein diversity and shaping higher primate species. 

The  other  interesting  point  is  to  know  the  gene 
expression  pattern  between  human  and  chimpanzee, 
and then we compared them in two tissues of brain (202 
genes) and liver (96 genes). Of these, 9 in the brain and 
12 in the liver showed a significant change in expression 
level between human and chimpanzees in the range of a 
1.5-1 0-fold difference. Some of genes displaying significant 
changes in protein sequence or differences in expression 
between  human  and  chimpanzee  might  be  correlated 
with  physiological  or disease  susceptibility  differences 
exhibited  between  the  two  species,  such  as  immune 
response (IFNAR2, IFNGR2,  CXADR, ITSN1 and CRVZL 1), 
developing heart ( SH3BGR), peripheral nervous system

( C21orf2), early brain development ( SYNJ1 and ANKRD3), 
cell cycle progression (MCM3AP), and Knobloch syndrome 
(COL 18A 1).  Beside these results, we analyzed SNP for 
interfering the ancestral allele of any human SNP locus, 
Ka/Ks test, and promoter 

for 

Conclusions 
Our data revealed a complex set of genetic differences 
between  human  and  chimpanzee.  Whole  genome 
comparative  and 
further  experimental  studies  are 
required  before  inferring  the  impact  of  these  genetic 
changes 
the  biological  consequences  of  the 
organism.  Nonetheless,  data  presented  here  suggest 
that  the  biological  consequences  derived  from  the 
genetic differences may be more complicated  than  our 
previous speculation and offer a framework allowing the 
design  of  experimental  strategies  for  testing  novel 
hypothesis. In present, whole genome sequencing project 
of chimpanzee is progressing by USA sequencing groups 
by shot-gun sequencing, and also our consortium group 
will  finish  chimpanzee Y chromosome sequencing with 
very  high  quality  in  a  few  time.  And  then  I  expect  to 
understand the question of what makes us human is not 
so far.
