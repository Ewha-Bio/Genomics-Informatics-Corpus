Abstract

RAS  guanyl-releasing  protein  3  (RasGRP3),  a  member  of 
the  Ras  subfamily  of  GTPases,  functions  as  a  guanosine 
triphosphate  (GTP)/guanosine  diphosphate  (GDP)-regu-
lated  switch  that  cycles  between  inactive  GDP-  and  ac-
tive  GTP-bound  states  during  signal 
transduction. 
Various  growth  factors  enhance  hepatocellular  carcino-
ma  (HCC)  proliferation  via  activation  of  the  Ras/Raf-1/ 
extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase 
(ERK)  pathway, 
which  depends  on  RasGRP3  activation.  We  investigated 
the  relationship  between  polymorphisms  in  RasGRP3 
and  progression  of  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)-infected  HCC 
in  a  Korean  population.  Nineteen  RasGRP3  SNPs  were 
genotyped  in  206  patients  with  chronic  liver  disease 
(CLD)  and  86  patients  with  HCC.  Our  results  revealed 
that  the  T  allele  of  the  rs7597095  SNP  and  the  C  allele 
of  the  rs7592762  SNP  increased  susceptibility  to  HCC 
(OR=1.55,  p=0.04  and  OR=1.81∼2.61,  p=0.01∼0.03, 
respectively).  Moreover,  patients  who  possessed  the 
haplotype  (ht)  1  (A-T-C-G)  or  diplotype  (dt)  1  (ht1/ht1) 
variations  had  increased  susceptibility  to  HCC  (OR=1.79
∼2.78,  p=0.01∼0.03).  In  addition,  we  identified  an  as-
sociation  between  haplotype1  (ht1)  and  the  age  of  HCC 
onset;  the  age  of  HCC  onset  are  earlier  in  ht1  +/+  than 
ht1  +/-  or  ht1  -/-  (HR=0.42∼0.66,  p=0.006∼0.015). 
Thus,  our  data  suggest  that  RasGRP3  SNPs  are  sig-
nificantly  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  develop-
ing  HCC.

Introduction

Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  the  fifth-most  preva-
lent  cancer  worldwide  and  the  third-most  lethal  malig-
nancy  (Bosch,  Ribes  et al.,  2004;  Bruix,  Boix  et al., 
2004).  On  average,  approximately  398,000  males  are  di-
agnosed  with  HCC  each  year  in  the  world  (Parkin,  Bray 
et al.,  2001).  It  is  well  known  that  hepatitis  B  virus 
(HBV),  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV),  aflatoxin  B1  intake,  and 
metabolic  disorders  such  as  hemochromatiosis  and  al-
pha-antitrypsin  deficiency  are  major  risk  factors  for  liver 
cirrhosis  and  HCC  (Arbuthnot  and  Kew,  2001).  The  in-
cidence  of  HCC  that  is  coincident  with  HBV  infection  is 
high  in  East  Asian  and  African  countries  (Caselmann, 
1998).  More  than  90%  of  HCC  tumors  are  found  in  pa-
tients  with  chronic  hepatitis  or  cirrhosis  (Laurent-Puig 
and  Zucman-Rossi,  2006).  Recent  studies  have  com-
pared  healthy  patients  with  those  who  suffer  from  liver 
disease  (including  chronic  hepatitis,  cirrhosis,  and  HCC). 
However,  few  studies  have  studied  the  progression  of 
chronic  liver  disease  with  regard  to  HCC. 
    Genetic  variations  are  thought  to  influence  the  risk  of 
developing  HCC  (Edmondson,  Henderson  et al.,  1976; 
Cha  and  Dematteo,  2005),  particularly  those  that  involve 
the  activation  of  cellular  oncogenes  or  the  inactivation  of 
tumor  suppressor  genes  in  various  signaling  pathways 
(e.g.,  mutation  of  beta-catenin-related  Wnt/beta-catenin 
signals  (Pang,  Yuen et al.,  2004)  and  overexpression  of 
Ras  signaling  (Mitin,  Rossman et al.,  2005)).  Also,  single 
nucleotide  polymorphsims 
famous 
genes,  such  as  p53  (Kirk,  Lesi  et al.,  2005),  HDAC10 
(Park,  Kim  et al.,  2007)  and  MMP2  (Wu,  Zhang  et al., 
2008),  have  been  significantly  associated  with  HCC.  The 
significant  SNPs  of  these  genes  may  represent  genetic 
markers  that  are  in  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  with  other 
causative  variations.  Also  recently,  many  SNP  studies 
that  are  related  to  various  human  diseases  have  been 
reported  (Lee,  Kim  et al.,  2007). 
    Ras  signaling  transduction  pathways  influence  cell 
proliferation,  survival,  differentiation,  vesicular  trafficking, 
and  gene  expression  in  B  cells  (Mitin,  Rossman  et al., 
2005).  In  previous  studies,  various  growth  factors  were 
found  to  enhance  HCC  cell  proliferation,  as  well  as  tu-

(SNPs)  of  many

mor  invasion  and  metastasis,  via  the  activation  of  the 
Ras/Raf-1/extracellular  signal-regulated  kinase 
(ERK) 
pathway  (Nonomura,  Ohta  et al.,  1987;  Pang,  Yuen  et 
al.,  2004;  Tsuboi,  Ichida  et  al.,  2004).  Also,  over-
expression  of  Ras  genes  is  common  in  human  HCC 
tissue.  Active  Ras  stimulates  the  Raf1-Mek-1/ERK  effec-
tors  by  binding  to  RassF1A  and  appears  to  induce 
apoptosis  (Ito,  Sasaki  et al.,  1998).  RassF1A  hyper-
methylation  has  been  observed  in  various  cancer  cell 
lines,  including  an  HCC  cell  line  (Schmidt,  McKillop  et 
al.,  1997).
    RasGRP3  (Ras  guanyl-releasing  protein  3)  is  a  mem-
ber  of  the  Ras  subfamily  of  GTPases  as  a  guanosine  di-
phosphate  (GDP)/guanosine  triphosphate  (GTP)  nucleo-
tide  exchange  factor  (GEF)  and  functions  in  signal  trans-
duction  as  a  GTP/GDP-regulated  switch  that  cycles  be-
tween  inactive  GDP-  and  active  GTP-bound  states 
(Rebhun,  Castro  et al.,  2000).  These  factors  are  key 
links  between  cell  surface  receptors  and  Ras  activation. 
RasGRP3  is  located  from  chromosomes  2p24.1  to  p25.1 
and  comprises  19  exons.  RasGRP3  consists  of  4  do-
mains  that  contain  the  Ras  exchange  motif  (REM),  a 
Ras-GEF  domain,  EF-hands  and  a  C1  domain.  The  C1 
domain  of  RasGRP3  binds  directly  to  phorbol  esters, 
acts  as  a  potent  tumor-promoting  operator,  and  is  ex-
pressed  in  skeletal  muscle  and  liver  (Lorenzo,  Kung  et 
al.,  2001).  In  addition,  the  activation  of  RasGRP3  by 
Thr-133  phosphorylation  induces  the  B  cell  receptor  sig-
naling  and  activates  small  GTPases  of  the  Ras,  Rho, 
and  Ra1  families,  which  play  important  roles  in  tumor 
biology  (Aiba,  Oh-hora  et al.,  2004).  RasGRP3  also  is 
thought  to  be  associated  with  developing  blood  vessels 
via  its  involvement  in  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor 
(VEGF)  signaling,  which  plays  an  important  role  in  angio-
genesis  (Roberts,  Anderson  et al.,  2004). 
    While  RasGRP3  plays  important  roles  in  the  regulation 
of  Ras  signaling,  studies  have  not  examined  the  poly-
morphisms  that  are  present  within  this  protein.  There-
fore,  we  explored  RasGRP3  polymorphisms  in  a  Korean 
population  and  explored  the  link  between  these  poly-
morphisms  and  the  risk  of  developing  HCC  during  HBV 
infection.

Methods

Subjects

The  study  population  contained  a  total  of  302  patients, 
including  86  patients  with  HCC  patients  (i.e.,  cases)  and 
206  patients  with  CLD  (i.e.,  controls).  A  total  of  302 
Korean  subjects  with  present  or  past  evidence  of  HBV 
infection  were 
the  Ajou  Genomic 
for  Gastroenterology  at  the  Ajou 
Research  Center 

recruited 

from 

(Anti-HBs;  HBsAb),  hepatitis  B 

University  Medical  Center  in  Suwon,  South  Korea  be-
tween  March  2002  and  February  2006.  The  study  proto-
col  was  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review  Boards 
(IRBs)  of  Ajou  University  Hospital  and  Pochon  CHA 
University.  Serological  markers  were  identified  using 
commercially  available  assays  for  hepatitis  B  surface 
antigen  (HBsAg),  antibodies  to  hepatitis  B  core  antigen 
(Anti-HBc;  HBcAb),  antibodies  to  hepatitis  B  surface  an-
‘e’  antigen 
tigen 
(HBeAg),  antibodies  to  hepatitis  B  ‘e’  antigen  (Anti-HBe; 
HBeAb),  HBV-DNA,  albumin,  alpha-fetoprotein  (AFP), 
glutamyl 
transpeptidase,  platelets,  aspartate  amino-
transferase  (AST),  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  bilir-
ubin,  cholesterol,  total  protein,  and  white  blood  cells. 
Patients  were  divided  into  2  groups.  The  first  group  (i.e., 
n=206)  experienced  CLD  for  more  than  7  months  with-
out  HCC.  This  group  consisted  of  patients  with  chronic 
hepatitis  and  liver  cirrhosis  who  were  positive  for  HBsAg 
and  negative  for  HBsAb  (HBcAb  (+),  HBeAg  (+),  or 
HBV-DNA  (+)).  Patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  exhibited 
elevated  ALT  levels  (i.e.,  ≥2  times  the  upper  limit  of 
normal)  at  least  once  during  the  follow-up  period  and 
were  diagnosed  via  ultrasonography.  The  second  group 
(i.e.,  n=86)  consisted  of  patients  with  HCC  who  tested 
positive  for  HBsAg  and  negative  for  HBsAb  (HBcAb  (+), 
HBeAg  (+),  or  HBV-DNA  (+)).  These  patients  were  diag-
nosed  using  standard  criteria  (i.e.,  serum  AFP  levels 
greater  than  400  ng/ml)  via  ultrasonography,  computed 
tomography  (CT),  or  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI). 
Patients  who  tested  positive  for  anti-HCV  or  anti-HIV 
antibodies  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.

Selection  of  SNPs  in  the  RasGRP3  gene

We  selected  the  RasGRP3  gene,  which  regulates  ras 
signaling;  its  signaling  is  important  for  carcinogenic 
mechanisms  and  is  especially  important  for  the  develop-
ment  of  hepatocellular  carcinoma.  The  basic  hypothesis 
that  underlies  our  approach  is  that  there  is  more  than 
1  common  SNP  in  the  genes  of  interest  that  are  asso-
ciated  with  an  altered  risk  of  HCC.  To  identify  a  set  of 
tagging  SNPs  (tSNPs),  that  efficiently  tags  all  the  known 
common  variants  (MAF;  minor  allele  frequency  ＞0.05) 
and  is  likely  to  tag  of  the  unknown  common  variants, 
coding  SNPs,  5’-UTR,  and  3’-UTR  regulatory  SNPs 
were  selected  based  on  the  JPT  (Japanese  in  Tokyo) 
and  CHB  (Chinese  in  Beijing)  data  that  were  down-
loaded  from  the  International  HapMap  site  (http://www. 
hapmap.org)  and  a  public  SNP  database  (http://www. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).  To  cover 
the  whole 
RasGRP3  gene  by  a  series  of  LD  blocks,  intronic  SNPs 
at  regular  intervals  were  selected.

Genotyping  analysis

Genomic  DNA  (gDNA)  was  extracted  from  whole  blood 
using  a  commercial  gDNA  extraction  kit  (i.e.,  G-DEXTM 
blood  genomic  DNA  purification  kit,  Intron  Biotechnology 
Inc.  Seongnam,  Korea).  The  amount  of  gDNA  was  de-
termined  using  the  Picogreen  double-strand  DNA  quan-
tification  reagent,  according  to  a  standard  protocol 
(Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR).  The  gDNA  was  ana-
lyzed  using  a  VictorTM  3  multilabel  counter  (with  ex-
citation  at  480  nm  and  emission  at  520  nm;  PerkinElmer 
Inc.  Waltham,  MA),  and  a  standard  curve  for  the  con-
centration  of  gDNA  was  created  using  known  concen-
trations  of  λ DNA.  Genotyping  was  performed  using 
the  Golden  Gate  genotyping  assay  according  to  a 
standard  protocol  (Illumina,  Inc.,  San  Diego,  CA,  USA). 
In  brief,  polymerase  chain  reactions  (PCRs)  were  per-
formed  in  reaction  mixtures  that  contained  allele-specific 
extension  oligomers  and  250  ng  of  genomic  DNA  by 
ramping  the  temperature  from  70oC  to  30oC  over  a  peri-
od  of  16  hours  (Supplementary  Table  1).  The  specific 
extension  products  were  then  used  in  PCRs  that  con-
sisted  of  34  cycles  of  35  seconds  at  95oC,  35  seconds 
at  56oC,  and  2  minutes  at  72oC.  The  PCR  products 
were  placed  in  96-well  filter  plates  (Millipore,  Billerica, 
MA,  USA)  for  purification.  Samples  were  then  placed  in 
384-well  microplates  and  hybridized  at  60oC  for  30  mi-
nutes  and  at  45oC  for  16  hours.  Finally,  the  384-well  mi-
croplates  were  washed  and  scanned  at  a  resolution  of 
0.8  um  using  a  BeadArray  Reader  (Illumina,  Inc.). 
Genotyping  analysis  was  performed  using  Illumina’s 
Beadstudio  software  (Version  3).  Other  reagents  were 
purchased  from  Sigma-Aldrich  (St.  Louis,  MO).

Statistical  analysis
    The  χ2  test  was  used  to  assess  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium  (HWE).  Three  genetic  models  (i.e.,  codo-
minant,  dominant,  and  recessive),  proposed  by  Lewis 
(Lewis,  Cathryn et al.  2002),  were  used  to  test  for  asso-
ciations  between  CLD  and  HCC.  LD  blocks  of  7  SNPs 
were  confirmed  using  HAPLOVIEW  software  (version 
4.0;  http//www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview),  according 
to  the  confidence  interval  method.  The  SNPs  were  in-
cluded  in  an  LD  block  if  the  MAF  exceeded  0.1  and  ex-
hibited  HWE  (p＞0.05).  Each  individual  haplotype  was 
inferred  using  the  SAS  haplotype  procedure.  Using  a 
single  SNP  association  test,  a  haplotype  association 
test,  and  a  diplotype  association  test,  multiple  logistic 
regression  models  were  used  to  calculate  odds  ratios 
(ORs),  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  and  correspond-
ing  p-values,  while  controlling  for  age  and  gender  as 
covariables.  Cox  regression  models  were  used  to  calcu-

late  hazard  ratios  (HRs),  95%  CIs,  and  corresponding 
p-values,  while  controlling  for  gender  in  the  haplotype 
association  test.  All  statistical  tests  were  performed  us-
ing  SAS  software  (SAS  Enterprise  Guide  4.1;  SAS 
Institute,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  and  HapAnalyzer  (Jung,  Pack 
et al.,  2004),  and  results  were  considered  statistically 
significant  if  p-values  were  greater  than  0.05.

The  clinical  characteristics  of  the  controls  (CLD)  and 
cases  (HCC)  are  shown  in  Table  1.  The  association  be-
tween  RASGRP3  polymorphisms,  CLD,  and  HCC  was 
evaluated.  Two  SNPs  were  identified  in  the  5’-flanking 
region  (rs597593,  rs583942),  2  SNPs  were  identified  in 
the  coding  region  (rs11680495,  rs13388394),  14  SNPs 
were 
(rs17012996, 
rs7597095, rs2305577, rs7565568, rs2305573, rs10189430, 
rs17013236, rs7592762, rs4670191, rs10182807, rs17013337, 
rs12470399,  rs13415927),  and  1  SNP  was  identified  in 
the  3’-untranslated  region  (UTR;  rs1801894)  (Supple-
mentary  Table  2).  Twelve  of  19  SNPs  were  mono-
morphic  or  not  polymorphic  and  did  not  exhibit  MAF 
values  less  than  0.05  (data  not  shown).  Seven  SNPs 
were  identified  in  the  Korean  population  (Fig.  1A).  The 
LD  block  was  constructed  using  the  confidence  interval 
method  in  the  HAPLOVIEW  program  (i.e.,  HWE＞0.05 
and  MAF＞0.1,  CLD=206,  HCC=86)  (Fig.  1B).  The  geno-
type  frequencies  of  each  polymorphism  were  analyzed 
in  the  CLD  and  HCC  groups  using  logistic  regression 
models  (Table  2),  while  controlling  for  age  and  sex  as 
covariates.  We  identified  2  SNPs  (rs7597095,  rs7592762)

CI=1.09∼6.27;  p=0.032,  respectively)  (Table  2). 
    The  haplotype  frequencies  and  association  test  are 
summarized  in  Table  3.  The  4  RasGRP3  polymorphisms 
were  in  an  LD  (|D’|  value,  ranging  from  0.96  to  0.98) 
block,  and  we  observed  9  haplotypes  of  a  total  of  16 
haplotypes.  Among  these  haplotypes,  5  had  a  frequency 
of  less  than  1%  and  therefore  analyzed,  except  for  its 
haplotypes  (data  not  shown).  Of  the  4  remaining  hap-
lotypes,  RasGRP3 ht1  [A-T-C-G]  was  significantly  asso-

    We  next  analyzed  the  associations  between  dip-
lotypes  of  the  4  RasGRP3  haplotypes  (i.e.,  A-T-C-G, 
A-T-T-C,  A-T-T-G,  T-C-T-C)  and  the  risk  of  developing 
HCC 
(Table  4).  Eighteen  distinct  diplotypes  were 
identified.  Among  them,  8  exhibited  low  frequencies  and 
were  not  analyzed.  When  we  compared  dt1  with  dt6 
and  dt1  with  dt8,  an  increased  risk  of  developing  HCC 
was  associated  with  dt1  (i.e.,  for  dt1  vs.  dt6,  OR=8.318, 
p=0.009;  and  for  dt1  vs.  dt8,  OR=3.821,  p=0.045). 
However,  dt6  was  associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of 
for  dt3  vs.  dt6,  OR=4.890, 
developing  HCC 
p=0.039;  and  for  dt6  vs.  dt7,  OR=0.189,  p=0.046).
    A  Cox  regression  model  that  compared  age  at  dis-
ease  onset  with  HCC  revealed  that  RasGRP3  ht1  con-
ferred  susceptibility  to  HCC  (i.e.,  for  the  codominant

Discussion

tumor  and 

type  of  malignant 

We  identified  genetic  markers  that  were  associated  with 
HCC  susceptibility  in  a  Korean  population.  HCC  is  the 
most  common 
the 
third-most  common  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths 
(Bruix,  Boix  et al.,  2004).  The  progression  of  human 
cancers  to  malignant  tumors  involves  the  mutation  of 
genes,  such  as  p53,  breast  cancer  1  (BRCA1),  and  Ras, 
which  contribute  to  cell  proliferation,  cell  cycle  pro-
gression,  apoptosis,  and  metastasis  (Greenblatt,  Bennett 
et al.,  1994;  Levy-Lahad  and  Friedman,  2007).  Other 
genes  that  are  involved  in  Ras  signaling  regulate  various 
cellular  functions,  including  cell  growth,  survival,  and  mi-

gration  (Vojtek  and  Der,  1998).  Ras  genes  enhance  the 
metastatic  phenotype  of  the  human  HCC  cell  line 
(Wang,  Lin et al.,  2001),  and  Ras  proteins  are  known  to 
be  overexpressed  in  human  cirrhotic  liver  and  HCC 
(Nonomura,  Ohta  et al.,  1987). 
    Activation  of  Ras  signal  transduction  pathways  de-
pends  on  RasGRP3,  which  functions  as  a  GTP/GDP 
switch.  Via  the  actions  of  RasGRP3,  activated  GTP-Ras 
proteins  bind  and  regulate  functionally  diverse  down-
stream  effectors,  such  as  Ras,  Raf1,  MEK,  and  ERK. 
The  RasGRP  family  is  directly  associated  with  the  Ras 
and  GTPase  molecules 
(Bar-Sagi  and  Hall,  2000; 
Shields,  Pruitt  et al.,  2000),  and  RasGRP  deregulation 
has  been  linked  to  carcinogenesis  and  tumor  pro-
gression  (Khosravi-Far  and  Der,  1994).

    The  C1  domain  of  RasGRP3  binds  directly  to  phorbol 
esters  that  are  potent  tumor-promoting  operator,  there-
by  increasing  the  levels  of  ERK1/ERK2  (Lorenzo,  Kung 
et al.,  2001).  Also,  Rap1  has  been  reported  to  be  acti-
vated  by  phorbol  esters  through  RasGRP3.  RasGRP3-/- 
B  cells  exhibit  undetectable  basal  levels  of  Ras-GTP,  as 
well  as  defective  BCR-induced  Ras  activation,  and 
BCR-induced  proliferation  in  vitro  depends  on  RasGRP3 
(Coughlin,  Stang  et al.,  2005;  Tangye  and  Hodgkin, 
2004).  In  addition,  RasGRP3  interacts  with  dynein  light 
chain  1  (DLC1),  contributes  to  cytoskeleton-mediated 
motility  and  intracellular  transport,  and  interacts  with 
various  proteins  that  are  associated  with  cell  survival 
and  apoptosis  (e.g.,  BimL  and  IKBα)  (Crepieux,  Kwon 
et al.,  1997;  Puthalakath,  Huang  et al.,  1999).  Thus, 
RasGRP3  may  interact  with  significant  SNPs  (i.e.,  ht1 
and  dt1),  thereby  regulating  GDP/GTP  switches  and 
converting  inactive  forms  to  active  forms  upstream  of 
Ras.  These  actions  also  may  enhance  the  expression  of 
Ras  and  downstream  effectors  molecules.  Our  data  re-
vealed  that  patients  who  possessed  the  SNPs  ht1  or 
dt1  progressed  more  quickly  to  HCC  than  did  other  pa-
tients  (Table  5,  Fig.  2). 
    To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  case-control  study 
that  demonstrates  a  significant  association  between 
RasGRP3  SNPs  and  progression  from  CLD  to  HCC  in 
a  Korean  population.  Our  results  show  that  the  T  allele 
of  the  rs7565568  SNP  and  the  C  allele  of  the  rs7592762 
SNP  increase  susceptibility  to  HCC.  Moreover,  patients 
with  CLD  who  possessed  ht1  (i.e.,  A-T-C-G)  or  dt1  (i.e., 
A-T-C-G/A-T-C-G)  were  at  increased  risk  for  developing 
HCC.  Finally,  we  identified  an  association  between 
ht1/ht1  and  the  age  of  HCC  onset;  a  highly  significant 
acceleration  in  HCC  progress  was  apparent  among  the 
RasGRP3  ht1-bearing  patients. 
    Thus,  our  findings  suggest  significant  associations  be-
tween  RasGRP3  SNPs  and  the  development  of  HCC 
during  HBV  infection.  In  summary,  we  identified  2 
RasGRP3  SNPs  (rs7597095,  rs7592762),  1  haplotype 
(ht1;  A-T-C-G),  and  1  diplotype  (dt1;  A-T-C-G/A-T-C-G) 
that  were  significantly  associated  with  the  development 
of  HCC-infected  HBV.
