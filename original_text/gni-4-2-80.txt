Abstract 

It is clear that the construction of large insert DNA libraries 
is important for map-based gene cloning, the assembly of 
physical maps, and simple screening for specific genomic 
sequences.  The  bacterial  artificial  chromosome  (BAC) 
system  is  likely to  be  an  important tool  for  map-based 
cloning of genes since BAC libraries can be constructed 
simply and analyzed more efficiently than yeast artificial 
chromosome  f'{AC)  libraries.  BACs  have  significantly 
expanded the size of fragments from eukaryotic genomes 
that can be cloned in Escherichia coli as plasmid molecules. 
To facilitate the isolation of molecular-biologically important 
genes  in  Ashbya  gossypii,  we  constructed  Ashbya 
chromosome-specific  BAC  libraries using  pBeloBAC11 
and pBACwich vectors with an average insert size of 1 00 
kb,  which  is  equivalent  to  19.8X  genomic  coverage. 
pBACwich  was  developed  to  streamline  map-based 
cloning by providing a tool to integrate large DNA fragments 
into specific sites in chromosomes. These chromosome(cid:173)
specific libraries have provided a useful tool for the further 
characterization  of  the  Ashbya  genome  including 
positional cloning and genome sequencing.

Introduction 

The filamentous ascomycete fungus Ashbya gossypii is 
pharmaceutically  and  molecular-biologically  important. 
For example, Ashbya gossypii produces large amounts 
(up to 7 g/L) of riboflavin (vitamin 82)  and therefore has 
been  used  for  most  of the  microbial  production  of this 
vitamin in the world (Bacher eta/., 1983; Jimenez et at., 
2005; Karas eta/., 2004; Keller eta/., 1988; Monschau et 
at.,  1998).  A.  gossypii is  ideally suited  for genetic and

biological  studies  (Forster  eta/.,  1998;  Forster  et at., 
1999; Kurtzman,  1995; Maeting eta/., 1999; Prillingeret 
at.,  1997;  Stahmann  et at.,  1997;  Steiner et at.,  1995; 
Wach et at.,  1994 ). A.  gossypii has a small genome size 
(C=9.2  Mb)  and  seven  chromosomes  which  can  be 
separated  by  PFGE  (pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis) 
(Dietrich et at., 2004 ).  Molecular studies have shown that 
the gene order is  conserved  and  reveals  an  extremely 
high  degree  of  similarity  between  A.  gossypii  and  S. 
cerevisiae (Aitmann-Johl and Philippsen,  1996; Dietrich 
et at.,  2004;  Steiner and  Philippsen,  1994; Wach et at., 
1997). The S.  cerevisiae ARS (autonomously replicating 
sequences) elements are functional  in  A.  gossypii and 
reliable  transformation  systems  have  been  developed 
(Wright  and  Philippsen,  1991 ).  Homo logs  of  SWP73 
(transcription  factor)  are  present  in  S.  cerevisiae,  A. 
gossypii,  C.  e/egans,  and mice, indicating that the gene 
may  belong  to  a  family  of  related  genes  encoding 
proteins with  analogous functions (Cairns et at.,  1996). 
Ashbya  gossypii  is  also  a  good  model  for  fungal 
developmental  biology (Wendland  and Walther,  2005). 
We  constructed  Ashbya  chromosome-specific  BAC 
libraries  using  pBeloBAC11  (Kim  et  at.,  1996)  and 
pBACwich (Choi, 2004; Choi et at., 2000) vectors with an 
average  insert  size  of  100  kb,  which  is  equivalent  to 
19.8X genomic coverage.  pBACwich was developed to 
streamline  map-based  cloning  by  providing  a  tool  to 
integrate  large  DNA  fragments  into  specific  sites  in 
chromosomes.  Whole  genome  sequencing  of  A. 
gossypii  using  this  BAC  library  has  given  a  greater 
understanding  of the  biology  of this  fungus  especially 
when  compared  with  the  entire  sequences  of the  S. 
cerevisiae (Dietrich  et at.,  2004;  Hall  et at.,  2005).  The 
Ashbya Genome Database (AGO) is now available as a 
comprehensive  online  source  of  information  covering 
genes  from  the  filamentous  fungus  Ashbya  gossypii 
(Hermida et at.,  2005). 

Methods 
Preparation  of  protoplasts  DNA  embedded  in 
agarose 
One gram of the harvested mycelium (fresh weight) was 
resuspended in 10 ml SPEZ (1M solbitol, 10 mM sodium 
phosphate buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1.7 mg/ml 
Zymolase) followed by an incubation period of 1 hour at 

Construction of Chromosome-Specific BAC Libraries from the Filamentous Ascomycete Ashbya gossypii  81 

30°C.  In-between,  the  protoplastation  efficiency  was 
monitored  under  the  microscope.  As  soon  as  the 
mycelium was protoplasted  the protoplasts were spun 
down at 1 ,000 g for 5 minutes, resuspended by very gentle 
shaking  in  ST buffer (1  M solbitol,  10 mM Tris-HCI,  pH 
8.0), centrifuged as described above and finally resuspended 
to a concentration of 2 x  108  protoplasts/ml in ST buffer. 
This yielded approximately 1 ml of protoplast suspension. 
To 100 111  of this protoplast suspension in an  Eppendorf 
tube 150111 STE buffer (1M solbitol, 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 
8,  0.125  MEDT A,  pH  8.0),  and  then  150  111  of  1.5% 
low-melting  agarose  in  0.125  M  EDTA,  pH  8.0  were 
carefully  added.  The  suspension  was  filled  into  plug(cid:173)
forms.  The  agarose  plugs  were  removed  from  the 
plug-forms, transferred to a 15 ml tube, and submerged in 
lysis buffer(0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0,  10 mMTris, pH 8.0, 1% 
N-lauroylsarcosinate,  1  mg/ml  Proteinase  K)  before 
overnight incubation at 52°C.  Lysis buffer was replaced 
by 0.5 M EDTA, pH 7.5, and the samples were stored at 
4 °C.  Prior to use, the agarose plugs were washed three 
times for 1 hour in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0,  1 mM EDTA, 
pH 8.0). 

Partial restriction enzyme digest in agarose plugs 
Agarose plugs were equilibrated in Hind ill I X digestion 
buffer without MgCI2 overnight. One hour prior to use, the 
buffer was exchanged  against fresh  buffer.  The digest 
was  carried  out  in  200  111  with  one  100 mg-plug.  Eight 
units of Hind ill restriction enzyme were added, followed 
by an incubation for one hour at 4°C to allow diffusion of 
the restriction enzyme into the plugs.  Finally MgCI2 was 
added to a final concentration of 0 to 1 0 mM to activate 
the restriction enzyme. The digest was carried out for 20 
min at 37"C. 

BAC cloning vector preparation 
E.  coli strain DH1 08 containing p8eloBAC11  (Choi and 
Kim,  2001;  Kim  eta!.,  1996) or pBACwich  (Choi  eta/., 
2000) was streaked onto an  LB  plate containing  12.5 11 
g/ml  chloramphenicol  and  grown  at 37"C  overnight.  A 
single colony was inoculated into 5 ml of media containing 
30  11g/ml  chloramphenicol,  and  grown for 8  hours (late 
logarithmic phase).  The miniculture was diluted  1:1000 
into  4  liters  of  LB  media  containing  30  11g/ml 
chloramphenicol.  The  inoculum was grown  at  30°C to 
approximately  1 x 109  cells  per  ml  (Asoo  =  1.0-1.5)  and 
harvested by centrifugation at 4 oc for 15 minutes at 6,000 
g (about 6,200 rpm in Beckman JA-14). The BAC vector 
was  purified  according  to  the  QIAGEN  Maxi  Plasmid 
Purification Protocol (QIAGEN, USA). The plasmid DNA 
was redissolved in 3.6 ml ofTE and 0.4 ml of 10 mg/ml of 

ethidium bromide was added. Approximately 4.0 g of solid 
CsCI  was added  to  make  a density of 1.59 g/ml.  This 
mixture was centrifuged in a Beckman NVT90.1  rotor at 
70,000  rpm  for  24  hours  at  20°C.  The  plasmid  and 
genomic DNA bands were viewed by illuminating the tube 
with long-wavelength UV. The lower band containing the 
covalently-closed  supercoiled  DNA  was  collected  by 
puncturing the side of the tube with a 21-gauge syringe 
needle (Relaxed DNA: p=1.55 g/ml,  Native superhelical 
DNA: p=1.59 g/ml). One volume unit of DNA in  buoyant 
CsCI and ethidium bromide was mixed with one volume 
unit  of  isoamyl  alcohol  saturated  with  ddH20.  The 
extraction was repeated until all visible color were removed. 
The DNA sample was diluted with two volume units of TE 
and precipitated with ethanol and centrifugation. The pellet 
was  washed  with  70%  ethanol.  The  final  yield  was 
approximately 20 to 40 llg from 4 liters of media. 

pBeloBAC11  or pBACwich was digested with Hind ill 
(Gibco BRL, USA) in the presence of spermidine (4 mM) 
at 37"C for 4 hours. The digest was extracted twice with 
phenol/chloroform  (1: 1 ),  and  precipitated  with  ethanol. 
The  digested  SAC  vector  was  dephosphorylated  by 
Shrimp Alkaline  Phosphatase (1  unit/11g  of DNA;  USB, 
USA)  with  a  suitable  volume  of  10X SAP  buffer  (10X 
SAP buffer;  200 mM Tris-HCI,  pH  8.0,  100 mM MgCI2). 
After two hours of incubation in 37"C, the enzyme was 
inactivated  by  heating  for  30  min  at  65°C.  The 
dephosphorylated vector was ethanol-precipitated before 
use in ligations. 

BAC library construction 
The  concentration  of an  enzyme  cofactor  (Mg ++)  was 
varied  to  produce  an  optimal  partial  digestion  and  the 
Hindill  site  was  used  as  a  cloning  site.  The  partially 
digested  DNA was  loaded  on  a  1%  LMP  agarose  gel 
(SeaPiaque,  FMC) in  1X TAE (50 mM Tris-acetate,  0.5 
mM  EDTA,  pH  8.0)  and  sealed  with  the  same  molten 
agarose as the gel. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was 
performed on a CHEF (contour-clamped homogeneous 
electric field) Mapper (810-RAD) using the conditions of 
4.0 V/cm,  5 s pulse,  in  TAE buffer,  12°C, for 10 hours. 
The  DNA band  in  the compression  zone was then  cut 
from the gel and subjected to a second round of PFGE 
under the same conditions as the first conditions. 

After removing the small trapped fragments, the DNA 
band in the compression zone was excised and melted 
at 65°C for 5 min. One unit of GELase (Epicentre,  USA) 
per 1 00 mg of gel was added to the DNA and incubated 
at 45°C for one hour. About 1 00 ng of the size selected 
DNA was ligated to the dephosphorylated SAC vector in 
a molar ratio of 1:10-15 (size selected DNA: vector DNA) 
in a total volume of 100111 with 6 units ofT4 DNA ligase

(USB, USA) in 66 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7 .6; 6.6 mM MgCb 10 
mM OTT;  66 mM ATP at 12 or 16°C over 16 hours. The 
ligation  solution  was  drop  dialyzed  on  Millipore  filters 
(filter  type  VS,  0.025  J.Lill)  with  TE  for  one  hour.  The 
ligation material (0.5-2.5 f.ll) was used to transform 20 to 
25  fll  of E.  coli DH10B  competent cells  using  the  BRL 
Ceii-Porator system (Gibco BRL, USA) according to their 
recommended protocol (Voltage 400V, Capacitance 330 
!lf, Impedance low ohms, Charge rate fast, Voltage Booster 
resistance 4 Kohms). 

Electroporated cells were transferred to culture tubes 
with  0.4  to  1 ml  SOC  (2%  Bacto tryptone,  0.5%  yeast 
extract, 10 mM NaCI, 2.5 mM KCI,  10 mM MgCb, 10 mM 
MgS04, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.0±0.1) and shaken at 220 
rpm for 50  minutes at 3rC before being  spread on  LB 
plates containing  12.5 flg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 flg/ml 
X-Gal  (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyi-~-D-galactoside) and 
25 
IPTG  (isopropylthio-~-galactoside).  White 
colonies were picked and arrayed in  384 well microtiter 
plates containing LB freezing medium (36 mM KzHP04, 
13.2 mM  KH2P04,  1.7 mM  Na citrate,  0.4  mM MgS04, 
6.8  mM  (NH4)2S04,  4.4%  v/v  glycerol,  LB,  12.5  flg/ml 
chloramphenicol).  The microtiter plates were incubated 
at 3rC overnight and stored at -80°C.

Library screening 
The nylon filters (12 x  8 em) can be inoculated with a 384 
prong  High  Density  Replicating  Tool  (HDRT)  from 
microtiter plates using the Biomek 2000 robot (Beckman, 
USA). The membranes were placed onto LB agar plates 
containing 12.5 flg/ml chloramphenicol and incubated at 
3rC for 12 to 36 hours until colonies of 1 to 2 mm diameter 
were  obtained.  The  membranes  were  removed  and 
placed, colony side up, on a pad of absorbent filter paper 
soaked in the following solutions for the specified time: 1) 
Solution 1 (0.5 N NaOH, 1.5 M NaCI) for 7 min; 2) Solution 
2 (1.5 M NaCI, 0.5 M Tris-HCI, pH 8.0), 7 min; 3) air dry for 
more than one hour; 4) Solution 3 (0.4 N NaOH), 20 min; 
5)  Solution  4  (5X  SSPE:  0.75  M  NaCI,  50  mM  NaH2 
P04-H20, 5 mM EDTA), 7 minutes; 6) air dry overnight. 
The membranes can  be stored at room temperature for 
months.  The  filters  were  prehybridized  at  65°C  for 
overnight with  hybridization  buffer (0.5  M  NaHP04,  pH 
7.2,  7% SDS,  1 mM EDTA,  10 mg/ml sheared denature 
salmon  sperm  DNA).  The  prehybridization  buffer was 
exchanged  with  fresh  buffer  and  prehybridization  was 
carried  out for an  additional  two to four hours at 65°C. 
Probes were added and hybridized for 18 to 36 hours at 
65°C. The filters were washed with 2X to 0.1 X sse (20X 
sse: 3M NaCI, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.4) and 0.1% 
SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) two to three times for 20 

min at 65°C. The filters were blotted dry with paper towels, 
wrapped in plastic wrap, and exposed for 24 to 72 hours 
with an intensifying screen at -80°C. Gel slices containing 
seven chromosomal bands, provided by Ashbya strains 
T1 008,  T1 023  and  T1 052,  were  treated  with  GELase 
(Epicentre,  USA)  and  used  as  probes  to  screen  high(cid:173)
density filters. 

Results 
Construction of 19.8X Ashbya BAC library 
We have made a BAC library of Ashbya gossypii DNA in 
pBACwich (1 ,536 clones) and pBeloBAC11  (289 clones) 
with an  average insert size of 1 00  kb (n=45,  insert size 
distribution 50 to 135 kb). Fig.  1 shows the Notl analysis 
of 17 random Ashbya BACs. The presence of several Notl 
sites in all but one BAC indicates that the Ashbya genome 
has a high G+C content (0 to 6 per clone: In Arabidopsis, 
tomato, and cotton, the number of Notl sites is often 0 to 
1 in a 100 kb region). The library was constructed with two 
ligations,  one for the  pBACwich  library and  one for the 
pBeloBAC11  library, and arrayed in five 384 well plates. 
The  pBACwich  vector  (Fig.  2)  has  a  promoterless 
hygromycin phosphotransferase gene that was designed 
to be activated and selected for in a plant cell upon Cre//ox 
site-specific integration (Choi eta/., 2000). These 1,825 
clones constitute a 19.8X library assuming a genome size 
of  9.2  Mb.  The  library  was  constructed  from  DNA 
fragments partially digested with Hind III.

have optimized CHEF conditions to separate chromosomes 
I, ill,  V  and  VII,  respectively.  However,  to  separate 
chromosomes that comigrate, researchers (Dr. P. Philippsen, 
personal communication) developed a set of strains that 
contain 1-Scel sites (Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial 
group I intron-encoded endonuclease: 18 bp recognition 
sequence)(Perrin eta/., 1993) in chromosome  II (T1 008), 
chromosome  IV (T1023),  and  chromosomeVII  (T1052). 
Protoplasts  of  different  strains  were  embedded  in  low 
melting  agarose,  cleaved with  1-Scel,  and  separated  by 
PFGE on a low melting agarose gel (Table 1 ).

Hybridization of the library with chromosome 
specific probes 
To physically assign each BAC clone to one of the seven 
Ashbya chromosomes,  we radioactively  labeled  CHEF 
gel  purified  single  chromosomes  or  chromosome 
fragments and  hybridized them to the BAC library.  The 
BAC library was double-spotted onto 8 x1 0 em filters in a 
3 x 3 grid pattern. Table 1 lists the strains from which the 
chromosomes or chromosomal fragments were isolated. 
Fig.  3  shows  representative  hybridization  patterns 
with chromosome probes  I, ill, IV and VI. The 384-well 
addresses of each  hybridization  are tabulated  and  the 
results of all the hybridizations are summarized in Table 
2.  As can  be seen,  only 1 to 2% of the BAC addresses 
showed  hybridization  to  more  than  one  chromosome(cid:173)
specific probe while  98 to  99%  showed  individual  and 
unique addresses.  Eighteen (16 inCh.  II and  ill+ 2 in

hybridized to 39 BAC clones, all of which were previously 
shown to hybridize to chromosome IV. As expected, each

Discussion 
Large-insert  DNA  libraries  are  essential  for  genome 
analysis,  physical  mapping,  map-based  cloning  and 
genome sequencing. We have constructed a chromosome(cid:173)
specific  BAG  library  of  Ashbya  gossypii  DNA.  This 
constituted a 19.8X library assuming a genome size of 9.2 
Mb (Dietrich eta/., 2004). It was incredibly easy to sort the 
library into chromosome bins because Ashbya has only 
seven  chromosomes which  can  be separated  in  CHEF 
system. A colony hybridization-based approach has been 
applied  to  rapidly  identify  chromosome-specific  clones 
from a human genomic BAG library (Kim eta/., 1995). They 
used flow sorted chromosome DNA (Longmire eta/., 1993) 
as  a  probe.  The  chromosome  itself  is  the  most  ideal 
hybridization probe for identifying all of the chromosome(cid:173)
specific  clones  from  a  genomic  library  in  a  single 
hybridization. 

Table  2  shows  the  results  of the  hybridization  with 
Ashbya chromosomes.  As  shown,  only  1 to  2% of the 
addresses showed any overlap while over 98% showed 
unique  addresses.  This  overlap  might  be  caused  by 
duplicated sequences in two chromosomes, chimerism, 
or probe  contamination.  We observed  that 78% of the 
overlapping clones hybridized with chromosomes  II and 
III.  These chromosomes comigrate on  CHEF gels and 
can  be only separated  by integrating  an  1-Scel site into 
one (in this case,  chromosome  II) of the chromosomes 
and  digesting  it  with  1-Scel.  It  is  likely  that  the  1-Scel 
digest  was  not  100%  efficient  and  resulted 
in  a 
contaminated  chromosome III probe.  The  BAG clones 
that  did  not  hybridize  to  any  probes  may  contain  the 
extra-chromosomal DNA (i.e., mitochondrial DNA) since 
this library was constructed using protoplasts. 

The  number  of  BAG  clones  hybridizing  with  the 
chromosome-specific probes correlates well with the size 

of each  A.  gossypii chromosome as  shown  in  Table 2 
except for chromosome VII. Chromosome VII contains the 
tandemly arrayed nucleolar organizer region (NOR) which 
may be unclonable (Motovali-Bashi eta/., 2004). The NOR 
contains  100-200  copies  of  rONA  in  the  yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 

To further demonstrate the usefulness of this library, 
we  isolated  BAG  DNAs  from  chromosome  !-specific 
clones, fingerprinted them, and constructed contigs (data 
not  shown).  Using  this  approach,  a  complete  physical 
map  of  Ashbya  gossypii  chromosomes  can  be 
constructed. If we isolate each chromosome-specific BAG 
clone, mini prep the DNA with an AutoGen 7 40 {Integrated 
Separation Systems, Japan) (384 clones/day), fingerprint, 
and compare each fingerprint, it would take approximately 
one month to construct a complete physical map. 

Based on considerations of stability, insert size, ease 
of  isolation  and  yield,  the  Ashbya  BAG  library  would 
seem  ideally suited for use  in  the study of the Ashbya 
genome and  the purified  BAG  DNA should  be  suitable 
for shotgun cloning for sequencing as proven in Dietrich et 
a/.  (Dietrich et a/.,  2004 ).
