The molecular vibration-activity relationship in the receptor-ligand interaction of adenosine receptors was investigated by 
structure similarity, molecular vibration, and hierarchical clustering in a dataset of 46 ligands of adenosine receptors. The 
resulting  dendrogram  was  compared  with  those  of  another  kind  of  fingerprint  or  descriptor.  The  dendrogram  result 
produced by corralled intensity of molecular vibrational frequency outperformed four other analyses in the current study of 
adenosine receptor agonism and antagonism. The tree that was produced by clustering analysis of molecular vibration 
patterns showed its potential for the functional classification of adenosine receptor ligands.

Keywords: corralled intensity of molecular vibrational frequency, G-protein-coupled receptors, molecular descriptor, mole-

cular vibration-activity relationship, purinergic P1 receptors

Introduction

Membrane proteins play crucial roles in organismal trans-
duction of information. Molecular recognition in biological 
membrane systems is the initial process triggering external 
factors to be passed into the inner part of a cell. G protein- 
coupled receptors (GPCRs), which consist of 7 transmem-
brane segments, play pivotal roles for signal transduction in 
higher  eukaryotes  and  organize  the  largest  families  of 
proteins  in  the  human  genome  [1].  The  fact  that  drugs 
targeting  GPCRs  constitute  over  one-third  of  pharma-
ceuticals shows the importance of GPCRs as drug targets 
[2].

Adenosine receptors (AdoRs) belong to a family of rho-
dopsin-like  class  A  GPCRs,  which  constitute  the  largest 
portion of GPCRs in humans, including olfactory receptors, 
and  there  are  four  known  subtypes  of  AdoRs－namely, 
AdoR1, AdoRA2A, AdoRA2B, and AdoR3 [3, 4]. Although 
these AdoR subtypes have distinct amino acid sequences and 
tissue-specific  distribution,  their  endogenous  agonist  and 
ligand-binding pockets are highly conserved.

The  biogenic  nucleoside  adenosine  (Fig.  1)  exerts  its 
effects by interacting with AdoRs that are involved in various 

diseases,  such  as  cardiac  ischemia,  arrhythmia,  neuro-
degeneration,  diabetes,  glaucoma,  and  inflammation  [5]. 
The physiological effects of AdoRs can be used for diagnoses 
and planning of the surgical strategies, such as in coronary 
artery diseases [6].

Olfaction, the sense of smell, is also mediated by class A 
GPCRs－namely,  olfactory  receptors.  The  fundamental 
mechanism  of  olfaction  is  now  under  some  controversy 
[7-9].  Various  attempts  were  introduced  to  describe  the 
molecular  mechanism  of  receptor-ligand  recognition  in 
olfaction, such as the binding theory and vibration theory

[10-12].  The  former,  where  the  specificity  of  ligand  is 
explained by molecular shape, has been developed into a 
concept of a pharmacophore and is generally accepted by 
researchers. Nevertheless, this is not sufficient to give the 
account of ligand variety and agonism complexity of GPCRs.
In recent decades, there have been many efforts to find an 
efficient way to seek or make appropriate ligands working on 
the  target  receptors  through  a  chemogenomic  approach. 
Application of molecular descriptors can make an efficient 
way to discriminate ligand binding modes in receptor-ligand 
relationships  in  such  cases  as  in  silico  chemogenomic 
screening [13]. Molecular descriptors encoding information 
about the molecular structure can be classified by the dimen-
sionality  of  their  molecular  representation,  and  they  are 
almost on the structural, topological, and geometrical bases 
[14]. They are also including information on dipole moment, 
electric polarizability, and electrostatic potential in their data 
types.

Lately, a computational approach was carried out to search 
for a molecular vibration-activity relationship in the agonism 
of histamine receptors, and the author suggested that the 
molecular vibrational frequency pattern may play a role as a 
possible molecular descriptor for histamine receptor ligands 
[15].  The  EigenVAlue  (EVA)  descriptor  is  also  based  on

infrared  range  molecular  vibrations  among  the  various 
molecular descriptors and is a unique one, based on eigen-
values corresponding to individual calculated normal modes 
among various molecular descriptors [16, 17].

In  the  present  paper,  we  tested  the  potential  of  the 
corralled  intensity  of  molecular  vibrational  frequency 
(CIMVF) [15] as a molecular descriptor, compared to the 
EVA descriptor and other descriptors for the classification of 
AdoR ligands.

Methods
Dataset

All  46  ligand  molecules  in  the  dataset,  comprising  23 
AdoR agonists and 23 antagonists, are shown in Table 1, with 
the Tanimoto distance of each ligand from adenosine.

The  Tanimoto  coefficient  is  a  widely  used  measure  of 
molecular structural similarity. The coefficient is defined as 
Tc = Nab/(Na + Nb － Nab), with Nab being the number of 
common bits, Na the unique bits in molecule a, and Nb the 
unique bits in molecule b, using a molecular fingerprint [18]. 
In  this  study,  the  molecular  similarity  to  adenosine  was 
calculated as the Tanimoto coefficient using the 38-bit set.

Molecular descriptors

Molecular fingerprints: MACCS keys, PubChem, and Klekota- 
Roth fingerprint
Molecular  fingerprints  are  binary  bit  string  represen-
tations that capture diverse aspects of molecular structure 
and properties and are popular tools for virtual screening 
[19]. In this study, three fingerprints－MACCS keys [20], 
PubChem  fingerprint  [21],  and  Klekota-Roth  fingerprint 
[22]－were  tested  to  be  compared  with  the  Tanimoto 
coefficient and other descriptors. The descriptor numbers of 
the MACCS, PubChem, and Klekota-Roth fingerprints are 
320, 881, and 4860, respectively. The MACCS keys of each 
ligand were generated by a MACCS key generator, and the 
other  two  fingerprints  of  the  ligands  were  calculated  by 
PaDEL-Descriptor [23].

EVA descriptor
An  ideal  molecular  descriptor  should  encode  all  the 
features of a molecule in numerical form. EVA, based on the 
normal coordinate eigenvalues, is derived from calculated 
infrared range vibrational frequencies and consequently has 
the  characteristic  feature  of  molecular-specific  vibration. 
The resulting vibrational frequencies were then convolved 
using  a  sum  of  Gaussian  functions  to  generate  a  pseu-
dospectrum of 3N-6 overlapping kernels:

, where N is the number of atoms, σ is a fixed standard 
deviation  of  the  Gaussian  function,  and  fi  is  the  i‒th  fre-
quency of the molecule. We fixed the value of σ to 5 cm-1 in 
this study. 

CIMVF descriptor
For a simplified comparison of the molecular vibration 
patterns, the calculated molecular vibrations of a ligand were 
sorted in increasing order and taken into each corral with a 
fixed step (e.g., 5 cm-1) size. The intensities of each mo-
lecular vibrational frequency in the same corral were sum-
med up as the representative of the corral. As a molecular 
descriptor of a ligand, the intensity of each corral is displayed 
in a 1-dimensional vector containing 800 elements from the 
vibrational  frequency  range  of  0‒4,000  cm-1.  The  calcu-
lations  of  CIMVF  were  performed  by  in-house  scripts 
written in Python.

EVA and CIMVF descriptors were produced from Pub-
Chem SDF data of ligands through geometry optimization 
and calculations of molecular vibrations with the GAMESS 
program  package  [24].  The  similarity  matrices  obtained 
from  these  five  cases  of  molecular  representations  were 
subjected to hierarchical clustering using complete linkage 
method.

Calculation of molecular vibration

Since the EVA and CIMVF descriptors require geometry 
optimization of a given molecule, each provided theoretical 
3-D conformer SDF underwent single low-energy confor-
mation using the GAMESS program package [24]. Restricted 
Hartree-Fock calculations using the BLYP DFT method with 
the 6-31G basis set were performed to optimize the geo-
metries  of  the  molecules.  Each  result  was  taken  as  the 
representative conformation of the molecule, although the 
calculation  of  molecular  vibrational  frequency  has  some 
dependence  on  conformation.  The  results  of  geometry 
optimization were subjected to the calculation step for the 
molecular vibrational frequency with RUNTYP of HESSIAN 
in the GAMESS program. 

Hierarchical clustering of molecular descriptors and 
dendrogram structure comparison

To test the availability of CIMVF as a molecular descriptor 
for the classification of AdoR ligands, a kind of molecular 
calculation using agglomerative hierarchical clustering was 
adopted in this work.

Each fingerprint or descriptor of ligands was gathered into 
a  matrix  of  cognate  fingerprint  or  descriptor.  Finally,  the 
similarity matrix, comprising descriptors of 46 ligands of 
AdoRs, was then subjected to hierarchical clustering in the 
agglomerative manner. In this study, each similarity matrix 
was finally clustered to make a dendrogram of 46 vertices. To 
compare  the  structures  of  the  resulting  dendrogram,  we 
used  a  program  for  pairwise  comparison  of  phylogenies, 
which shows the topological difference between two dend-
rograms [25].  The multiple comparison of the  5 dendro-
grams  was  also  carried  out  using  a  meta-tree-generating 
program  for  comparing  multiple  alternative  dendrograms 
[26].

Results and Discussion

As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  adenosine  and  caffeine,  a  typical 
agonist  and  antagonist  of  AdoRs,  respectively,  share  the 
structure of purine. However, the Tanimoto coefficient bet-
ween the two ligands is not high. The Tanimoto coefficient of 
some agonists to adenosine was lower than 0.3, though they 
did not take a large share. Moreover, the lowest Tanimoto

matrices  from  the  MACCS  keys,  PubChem,  and  Klekota- 
Roth fingerprints; EVA; and CIMVF are shown in Fig. 2.

PubChem  fingerprint  were  shown  to  be  similar  to  the 
Tanimoto coefficient pattern. The result of the Klekota-Roth 
fingerprint analysis showed a somewhat different pattern to 
the  fingerprint-based  one,  as  only  two  antagonists  were

performed  those  from  UNITY  2D  in  a  classification  of 
odorant molecules. However, the EVA analysis in the current 
study was positive but not perfect for the molecular pro-
perty-activity relationship in AdoR agonism. The larger σ 
got, the more the clusters in the dendrogram got entangled 
(data not shown). It might come from the Gaussian function 
that  smeared  out  the  vibrational  frequencies,  such  that 
vibrations  of  similar  frequency  overlapped  together.  The 
dendrogram obtained from the EVA descriptor showed an

eligible tree for the agonism of AdoRs on the whole (Fig. 
2D). One exception in which an antagonist (ZM241385) was 
clustered in a subtree of agonists might have resulted from 
smoothing  by  the  Gaussian  convolution  of  molecular 
vibration data.

All  antagonists  were  clustered  into  a  subtree  in  the 
dendrogram obtained from CIMVF analysis, as shown in Fig. 
2E. We can tell the regional difference between agonists and 
antagonists  in  the  dendrogram  and  also  find  that  the 
information from the CIMVF analysis can play a role in the 
discrimination of agonists from antagonists in AdoR ago-
nism. The discreteness of CIMVF data seems to facilitate the 
performance of the binary classification of AdoR ligands.

To find the topological difference between dendrograms, 
similarity  scores  between  every  two  dendrograms  were 
shown in Table 2. The similarity between two dendrograms 
was represented as a percentage. For example, the score of 
topological  similarity  between  the  two  dendrograms  of 
CIMVF and EVA analyses is 59.6%. The value has the highest 
similarity  among  all  comparisons.  A  distance  meta-tree 
build from five dendrograms of 46 AdoR ligands was illu-
strated in Fig. 3. As shown in the tree, the resulting dendro-
gram produced from the CIMVF data analysis has the nearest 
position to that produced from the EVA data analysis and is 
located the farthest from the dendrogram produced from the 
analysis of MACCS keys.

It is generally known that structurally similar molecules 
have  similar  properties  or  functions;  however,  a  small 
change in molecular structure can fairly affect its vibrational 
frequencies.  The  structural  variety  of  AdoR  ligands  was 
shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  Tanimoto  coefficients  of  LUF5835, 
BAY60-6583, and capadenoson to adenosine were smaller 
than 0.18, and the ligands share a hydroxyphenyl pyridine 
dicarbonitrile backbone (Fig. 4A). They seem to be dissi-
milar to other agonists that share the structure of purine. 
Several antagonists (Fig. 4B) do not have a similar structure 
to caffeine; however, they act as antagonists of AdoRs.

As mentioned above, the current experiment does provide 
circumstantial evidence for the molecular vibrational infor-
mation to AdoR agonism, at least. With a more concentrated 
study on the relationship between the molecular vibrational 
frequency  and  pharmacological  function  of  a  ligand,  the 
vibrational  spectrum  of  a  ligand  molecule  may  explicitly 
propose  a  novel  path  to  the  field  of  receptor-ligand  inte-
raction mechanisms.
