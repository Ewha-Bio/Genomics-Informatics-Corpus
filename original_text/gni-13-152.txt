Recently, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Analysis Working Group converted data from ChIP-seq analyses from 
the  Broad  Histone  track  into  15  corresponding  chromatic  maps  that  label  sequences  with  different  kinds  of  histone 
modifications in promoter regions. Here, we publish a frequency profile of the three ChromHMM promoter states, at 200-bp 
intervals,  with  particular  reference  to  the  existence  of  sequence  patterns  of  promoter  elements,  GC-richness,  and 
transcription starting sites. Through detailed and diligent analysis of promoter regions, researchers will be able to uncover 
new and significant information about transcription initiation and gene function.

Introduction 

Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells contain important 
gene-regulating elements, located within promoter regions 
[1,2]. It is known that promoter sequences possess special 
signatures to distinguish them from the rest of the genome 
sequences. A few core promoter elements have been detec-
ted, of which the most common elements are the CpG island, 
TATA  box, initiator  (Inr), downstream  promoter element 
(DPE), and TFIIB recognition element (BRE) [2], but these 
promoter elements may not be universal. 

Recently, a group from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE)  project  published  chromatic  maps  to  mark 
histone  modifications  within  nine  cells  of  different  types 
from  the  human  genome,  drawn  from  the  results  from 
chromatin  immunoprecipitation  sequencing  (ChIP-seq) 
analyses of these same cells [1,2]. From each of these nine 
cells, Ernst et al. [3,4] published 15 chromatin states of the 
human  genome.  Among  them,  the  first  three  states 
represent promoter regions: state 1 (Active_Promoter), state 
2  (Weak_Promoter),  and  state  3  (Poised_Promoter).  The 

information  gained  from  the  exploration  of  promoter 
elements and transcription starting sites will enable resea-
rchers  to  produce  more  accurate  promoter  prediction 
algorithms, which in turn will yield deeper insight into the 
process of transcription initiation and gene functions. 

Here, we publish frequency profiles of the ChromHMM 
promoter states of the human genome, at 200bp intervals, 
paying  particular  attention  to  the  existence  of  promoter 
elements, such as CpG islands, TATA boxes, Inr, DPE, and 
recognition  elements  from  the  transcription  factors  that 
bind with polymerase II (BRE) (signal features), together 
with transcription starting sites, in terms of size, overlapping 
patterns, and locations. 

Results 

Ernst et al. [4] applied unsupervised learning methods to 
convert  the  Broad  Histone  track’s  results  from  ChIP-seq 
analyses into specific points that indicate promoter regions 
on chromatin maps for 15 chromatin elements within the 
genome. These 15 chromatin states were chosen because of 
their rich biological content, as well their well-established

hosted  by  the  ENCODE  Analysis  Data  Hub,  which  is 
available  for  public  download  under  the  ENCODE  Data 
Release Policy (http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/downloads. 
html).  We  downloaded  the  BED  files  for  the  chromatin 
signal tracks of the nine ENCODE cell types. Within them, 
chromatin states 1, 2, and 3 represent Active, Weak, and 
Posed Promoters, respectively, which differ only in regard to 
the levels of expression in various biological assays. These 
states were defined, based purely on 9 chromatin marks, and 
their input controls across 9 cell types.

Depending  upon  the  cell  type,  slight  variances  were 
found, as seen in Table 1. For example, the gm12878 cell line 
has  an  active  promoter  consisting  of  14,674  blocks  and 
occupies  0.80%  of  the  whole  genome,  whereas  k562  has 
14,951 blocks and occupies 0.68% of the whole genome, for 
chromatin state 1. To overcome this slight variance in cell 
lines, we divided the promoter regions uniformly at 200-bp 
resolution, regardless of the 9 cell line block boundaries.

Fig. 1 shows our Java code, which relies on Java’s Oracle 
interface (Oracle Database 12c Standard Edition) and impl-
ements  regular  expressions,  based  on  predefined  classes 
from the java.util.regex package, in order to pattern-match 
different  promoter  elements,  such  as  CpG  islands,  TATA

boxs, Inr, DPE, and BRE, for each 200-bp window. The code 
also builds upon formal grammar rules based on the stru-
ctural properties seen in promoter sequences, though these 
patterns usually apply only to the core promoters [5,6]. Our 
Java code produces an output profile consisting of the 18 
required fields as follows (Fig. 2).

The first three fields are: the name of the chromosome, the 
starting position of the feature in the chromosome, and the 
ending position. The next four fields represent the frequen-
cies of the 4 promoter elements. For example, Fig. 2 shows 
that the nucleotide sequences starting from 28337 to 23537 
(200 bp) in chromosome 1 contains 1 occurrence of a TATA 
box,  6  occurrences  of  Inr,  0  occurrences  of  BRE,  and  6 
occurrences of DPE. The next 9 fields indicate the Chrom-
HMM annotation of 9 cell lines (K562, GM12878, H1HESC, 
HEPG2, HMEC, HSMM, HUVEC, NHEK, and NHLF). The 
last two fields indicate the existence of DataBase of Human 
Transcription  Start  Sites  (dbTSS)  data  [7,8],  and  the  GC 
ratio, respectively, where the hg19promoter file for dbTSS 
data was used for indexing (ftp://ftp.hgc.jp/pub/hgc/db/dbtss/ 
dbtss_ver8/Sanger_data/).

Table 2 shows the summary of our promoter frequency 
profile.  The  data  show  significants  difference  from  the 
known statistical factors of core promoters. It is due to the

fact that we divided the regions into 200 bp lengths whereas 
the  core  promoter  elements  are  known  to  exist  typically 
within 50 bp (base pairs) upstream to 50 bp downstream of 
the TSS [2], and that we are including the Poised_Promoter 
state of the ChromHMM. 

From  the  ChromHMM  human  promoter  blocks,  the 
results of our statistical survey on 176,579 units show that 
DPE sequences have the highest frequency among the four 
chosen  motifs  in  promoter  elements,  appearing  in  about 
97.1% of the ChromHMM promoter regions, meanwhile Inr 
is seen in 92% of promoter regions, and BRE is seen in only 
17.3% of the promoters (It is known that Inr usually occurs 
only about half of the human promoters [3]). TATA boxes 
are found in 52.2% of the ChromHMM promoter blocks. 
Some contextual patterns have been recognized for certain 
promoter elements. For example, we can expect to find BREs 
within GC-rich areas, meanwhile areas with TATA boxes are 
typically GC-poor. 

In total, there are 9,435 ChromHMM promoter blocks in 
the dbTSS locations (approximately 5.34%). The number of 
200-bp blocks that contain all four promoter elements was 
176,579.  Among  them,  only  9,436  of  the  blocks  contain 
dbTSS  data  [7,8].  Some  of  the  blocks  showed  distinct 
associations with dbTSS data. For example, the promoter 
blocks that do not contain any of the promoter elements tend 
to have a higher GC ratio (0.68) where a dbTSS location 
exists. 

Conclusion

One of the strengths of our work versus previous studies 
is that we profiled the core elements separately, based on the 
three classes of promoter states (Active_Promoter, Weak_ 
Promoter,  and  Poised_Promoter  of  the  ChromHMM).  A 
more  detailed  analysis  of  frequency  profiles  in  regard  to 
these three states is beyond the scope of this paper. However, 
the complete frequency profiles and Java code are published 
through GitHub (https://github.com/KyungEunLee/motif). 
We believe that the frequency profiles presented of the three 
promoter states can be helpful for bioinformaticians to gain 
a deeper understanding of the characteristics of the various 
promoter regions and to improve upon old methods of core 
promoter  analysis  algorithms  for  their  specific  research 
needs.
