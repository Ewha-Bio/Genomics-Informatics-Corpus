In developing countries threat of cholera is a significant health concern whenever water purification and sewage disposal 
systems are inadequate. Vibrio cholerae is one of the responsible bacteria involved in cholera disease. The complete genome 
sequence of V. cholerae deciphers the presence of various genes and hypothetical proteins whose function are not yet 
understood.  Hence  analyzing  and  annotating  the  structure  and  function  of  hypothetical  proteins  is  important  for 
understanding the V. cholerae. V. cholerae O139 is the most common and pathogenic bacterial strain among various V. 
cholerae strains. In this study sequence of six hypothetical proteins of V. cholerae O139 has been annotated from NCBI. 
Various  computational  tools  and  databases  have  been  used  to  determine  domain  family,  protein-protein  interaction, 
solubility of protein, ligand binding sites etc. The three dimensional structure of two proteins were modeled and their ligand 
binding sites were identified. We have found domains and families of only one protein. The analysis revealed that these 
proteins  might  have  antibiotic  resistance  activity,  DNA  breaking-rejoining  activity,  integrase  enzyme  activity,  restriction 
endonuclease, etc. Structural prediction of these proteins and detection of binding sites from this study would indicate a 
potential target aiding docking studies for therapeutic designing against cholera.

Introduction

Vibrio cholerae is a gram-negative, highly motile, curved or 
comma-shaped  rod  with  a  single  polar  flagellum  [1].  V. 
cholerae is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, mainly found 
in unhygienic environment. V. cholerae secretes enterotoxin 
that  induces  a  life-threatening  secretory  diarrhea  called 
cholera. Cholera is a major epidemic disease. The cholera 
toxin binds to the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial 
cells  and  releases  an  enzymatically  active  subunit  which 
causes  a  escalation  in  cyclic  adenosine  5-monophosphate 
(cAMP) production. The resulted high cAMP level inside the 
cell causes massive secretion of electrolytes and water into 
the  intestinal  lumen.  Other  Vibrios  may  also  be  clinically 
significant for human and some are well-known to cause 
diseases in domestic animals as well. Nonpathogenic Vibrios 
are widely dispersed in the environment, mostly in estuarine 
waters and seafood’s [2]. V. cholerae comprises nearly 200 

serogroups based on the O antigenic structures [3]. Among 
them  two  serogroups  of  V.  cholerae  O1  and  O139  cause 
widespread cholera epidemics [4]. The emergence in 1992 of 
a  V.  cholerae  non-O1  serovar,  labeled  V.  cholerae  synonym 
O139 Bengal, in Bangladesh and India and its subsequent 
appearance in Southeast Asia, displacing V. cholerae O1 El Tor, 
was well known causative agent in the history of cholera [5]. 
In the autumn of 1993, V. cholerae serogroup O139 (Bengal), 
was implicated in outbreaks of cholera in Bangladesh and 
India. V. cholerae serogroup O139 (Bengal), causes charac-
teristic severe cholera symptoms and has been implicated in 
a case of a traveler returning from India to the United States 
[6]. V. cholerae O139 serogroup strains showed susceptibility 
to 22 anti-bacterials in various regions of the world and an 
increase  in  resistant  markers  with  resistance  to  fluoroqui-
nolones [7].

During recent years, hundreds of bacterial genomes are 
available, while their annotation is of interest [8]. However, 
many of these protein functions are still unknown. For this

reason, there is an increasing demand for the annotation of 
the functions of uncharacterized proteins, called “hypothetical 
proteins” [9], but the structures of which are known though. 
Structural genomics initiatives deliver plenty of structures of 
hypothetical proteins at a constantly growing rate. However, 
without function annotation, this huge structural storage is 
of little use to biologists who are interested in particular 
molecular systems. Additionally some of the proteins, which 
are known to be sound annotated, may have further functions 
beyond their listed archives. About half of the proteins in 
genomes  are  candidates  for  hypothetical  proteins  (HPs) 
[10]. Many of the “hypothetical proteins” occur in fact in 
more  than  one  bacterial  species,  which  increases  the 
probability that they are indeed protein coding genes and not 
the  consequence  of  erroneous  gene  predictions.  Proteins 
that  occur  in  diverse  species  can  be  combined  into 
orthologous  groups,  which  are  known  to  be  suitable  for 
functional  analyses  and  annotations  of  newly  sequenced 
genomes [11]. 

Improving the functional annotation is of great importance 
for many follow up studies and we here apply computational 
tools for function prediction for one of the most devastating 
human pathogens V. cholerae O139, the causative agent of 
cholera especially in Southeast Asia. Therefore an improved 
functional  annotation  of  its  proteome  is  of  particular 
urgency.  The  annotation  of  these  HPs  may  be  helpful  as 
markers and pharmacological targets. With the overall faith 
that the majority of hypothetical proteins are the product of 
pseudogenes, it is necessary to have a tool with the capability 
of  analyzing  the  minority  of  hypothetical  proteins  with  a 
high probability of being expressed [10]. So far, there is no 
classification  of  HPs  and  functioning  terms  are  swapping 
definitions  of  hypothetical  proteins.  Here,  we  combined 
physiochemical properties with protein-protein interaction 
(PPI)  based  function  predictions.  Our  present  study  is 
mainly aimed to predict the structure, function and binding 
sites of these HPs which are important for docking studies 
for drug designing.

different  properties  i.e.,  physicochemical,  functional,  and 
structural characteristics of HPs. 

Physicochemical and functional categorization

By  using  the  Expasy’s  Protparam  server  (http://us.ex-
pasy.org/tools/protparam) physicochemical characterization, 
molecular  weight,  theoretical  isoelectric  point  (pI),  total 
number  of  positive  and  negative  residues,  extinction 
coefficient [12], instability index [13], aliphatic index (AI) 
[14] and grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) [15] of HPs 
were analyzed.

Pfam

Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) is designed as a com-
prehensive and accurate collection of protein domains and 
families [16, 17]. Pfam families are typed as Pfam-A and 
Pfam-B.  Each  Pfam-A  family  possess  a  curated  seed 
alignment containing a small set of envoyed members of the 
family and an automatically created full alignment which 
contains all noticeable protein sequences belonging to the 
family, as defined by profile Hidden Markov Models searches 
of primary sequence databases. On the other hand, Pfam-B 
entries are automatically created from the ProDom database 
and are shown by a single alignment [18].

CDD-BLAST

CD-Search  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/ 
wrpsb.cgi/) was done to find out the conserved domain of 
these protein sequences. This was performed with the use of 
RPSBLAST, a modified version of PSI-BLAST, to quickly scan 
a set of predetermined position-specific scoring matriceswith 
a protein query [19].

PPI prediction

STRING (http://string.embl.de/) is a database of known 
and  predicted  protein  interactions  by  using  four  sources: 
Genomic  Context,  (Conserved)  Co-expression,  High-th-
roughput Experiments, and Previous Knowledge. STRING 
currently contains the databases of 5,214,234 proteins from 
1,133 organisms [20].

Proteins location prediction 

Six  randomly  selected  HPs  which  contain  standard 
number of amino acids sequences of V. cholerae O139 were 
randomly retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. 
gov/) for annotation. Moreover these were supposed to find 
out  interactions  between  these  proteins  as  they  are  both 
from chromosomal and plasmid DNA. The sequence IDs of 
those 6 HPs were gi|84095108, gi|163644906, gi|163644912, 
gi|163644916,  gi|84468567,  and  gi|84468557.  Various 
computational tools and databases were used to analyze the 

PSORTB  (http://www.psort.org/psortb/)  server  was 
used to predict the cellular locations of HPs and then SOSUI 
server was used to find out whether the protein is soluble or 
trans-membrane in nature (http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/ 
sosui/sosui_submit.html).

Detection of disulfide bridges

DISULFIND  (http://disulfind.dsi.unifi.it/)  server  was 
used  to  predict  the  presence  of  any  disulfide  bond  state 

54

www.genominfo.org

between cysteine residues in the amino acid sequences of 
HPs.  Moreover,  disulfide  bridges  play  a  key  role  in  the 
stabilization of the folding process for many proteins. We 
analyzed the data using this software. The disulfide bridges 
are  very  important  finding  in  the  study  of  structural  and 
functional properties of specific proteins [21].

Protein structure prediction

(PS)2 (pronounced PS square) was used for the prediction 
of  the  tertiary  structures  of  HPs  (http://www.ps2.life. 
nctu.edu.tw/). This method combined PSI-BLAST [22, 23], 
IMPALA [24], and T-Coffee [25] by using an effective accord 
strategy in both target-template selection and target-template 
alignment. Three dimensional structures were constructed 
further using the modeling package MODELLER [26-28]. 
The predicted structures obtained from the PS square were 
saved in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) formats.

Active site prediction

Q-SiteFinder (http://www.modelling.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefin-
der/) was used to find out the ligand binding sites. It works 
by finding clusters of probes and binding hydrophobic (CH3) 
probes to the protein with most favorable binding energy. 
Q-SiteFinder requires uploading a PDB file or selecting one 
from the Protein Database. Proteins are primarily scanned 
for ligands and it uses the interaction energy between the 
protein and a simple van der Waals probe to locate vigorously 
favorable binding sites [29]. We used this tool for evaluating 
these  features  including  the  active  site  in  the  desired 
sequence.

Results and Discussion

We analyzed the physiochemical properties of these HPs 
of cholera for the first time. In Table 1 the physicochemical 
properties of HPs are tabulated. Isoelectric point (pI) of the 
HP ranges from 4.62 to 9.78. pI is the pH at which the amino 
acid of protein tolerates no net charge and hence does not 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  2,  2015

move in a direct current electrical field. The determined pI 
will be handy as solubility is minimum and in an electro 
focusing system mobility is zero at pI. Moreover proteins 
become stable and compact at isoelectric pH, for this reason 
computed pI will be helpful for developing a buffer system 
for purification by isoelectric focusing method.

At 280 nm, the extinction co-efficient of HPs ranges from 
23295  to  62005  M  cm  computed  by  Expasy’s  Protparam 
instead of 276, 278, 279, and 282 nm. The presence of high 
concentration of Cys, Trp, and Tyr indicates a higher extinction 
coefficient of HPs. The quantitative study of protein-protein 
and protein-ligand interactions in solution can be done by 
using this computed extinction coefficients. The instability 
index value of the HP was found to be ranging from 30.44 to 
50.35.  It is  predicted that  a protein  will be stable whose 
instability index is smaller than 40, a value above 40 predicts 
that the protein will be unstable [13]. 

Another parameter of structure identification of protein is 
instability  index.  Proteins,  gi|163644906,  gi|163644912, 
and gi|163644916 were stable and others were unstable. 
The instability index indicates an approximate stability of 
proteins in a test tube.

The AI is the relative volume of a protein occupied by 
aliphatic side chains (A, V, I, and L) and is considered as a 
positive factor for the raise of thermal stability of globular 
proteins. The range of the AI for the HPs is from 64.14 to 
82.92. The proteins with very high AI may show stability in 
a wide temperature range where lower AI proteins are not 
thermal stable and show more flexibility.
The GRAVY of HPs is ranging from –0.304 to –0.633. The 
better interaction of protein and water is occurring in low 
GRAVY.  The  GRAVY  value  for  a  protein  is  calculated  by 
adding the values of hydropathy of all the amino acids and 
dividing it by the number of residues in the sequence [14].
To study the functional analysis conserved domains were 
observed because conserved domains are functional units 
within  a  protein  that  act  as  building  blocks  in  molecular 
evolution and recombine in various arrangements to make

proteins with different functions. The data are then used for 
putative functional annotation of protein query sequences 
based on matches to specific super-families history, iden-
tification of proteins with similar domain. The proteins have 
been classified into particular families based on the presence 
of specific domains in the sequence [19]. In our study we 
used 6 HPs but found only 1 protein gi|84468567 possessing 
specific  domains  which  were  DNA_BRE_C  super-family, 
Topoisomer_IB_N, DUF3946 domains and they were classified 
as super-families accordingly. The presence of these domains 
in  the  HPs  indicates  that  the  protein  might  do  the  same 
function.  The  domains  of  the  HP  gi|84468567  and  their 
super-family is given by function in Tables 2 and 3.

Domains and families present in HPs were identified by 
the Pfam database research (Tables 4 and 5). They are PhnA 
Zn ribbon, prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attach-
ment site, Phage integrase family and integrase core domain.
To  explain  the  protein  functions  involved  in  various 
cellular processes it is important to know the sub-cellular 
localization  of  that  protein.  During  the  drug  discovery 
process  knowledge  of  the  sub-cellular  localization  of  a 
protein play a very significant role in target identification.

In our study, we have found two proteins gi|163644906, 
gi|184468567 are cytoplasmic as their best performing sites. 
The remaining other protein localization was not found. The 
server SOSUI differentiates whether the HPs are membranous 
or soluble. No trans-membrane protein was found and all 
were soluble.

Moreover,  DISULPHIND  server  revealed  no  disulphide 
bonds were present in any of those proteins which indicate 
that  they  were  thermally  unstable.  Moreover,  disulfide 
bridges play a major role in stabilizing the folding process of 
many proteins. Disulfide bridges are very important finding 
in the study of structural and functional properties of specific 
proteins [21].

For performing almost all the cellular functions the PPI 
are important. Proteins often interact with one another in a 
mutually dependent way to perform a common function. It is 
notable that translational factors interact among themselves 
to carry out the whole translation. The function of protein is 
predictable from this based on their interaction with other 
proteins. It is very rare that proteins bring out function with 
any interactions with other biomolecules. For this reason, in 
this post genomic era PPI databases have turned as a most 
important resource for searching biological networks and 
pathways  in  cells  [29].  The  proteins  gi|163644906  and 
gi|163644912 were found to have interaction with 2 proteins 
signal peptide peptidase SppA  domain-containing  protein 
and  DSBA  like  thioredoxin  domain  containing  protein. 
gi|163644916  had  interacted  with  3  proteins  such  as  IV

binding site identification on protein is important for a wide 
range  of  applications  including  structural  identification, 
comparison of functional sites, molecular docking and de 
novo  drug  design.  Active  site  residues  of  the  HPs  are 
mentioned  in  Table  8.  This  data  of  active  binding  site 
residues will give insight into identifying binding interactions 
and docking with specific ligand.

We  have  retrieved  6  HPs  from  NCBI  database  and 
determined their physicochemical properties and identified 
domains and families using various Bioinformatics tools and

were modeled (only 2) and their ligand binding sites were 
identified. Among them we have found domains and families 
of  only  one  HP,  analysis  showed  that  the  domains  and 
families are involved in DNA breaking-rejoining activities, 
integrase activity. All of these features from our findings may 
be used to design new potential drugs against this infectious 
bacterium.
