Abstract 
Backga.nd: Srroking effects are relatively well-documented, 
especially  on  cancers  and  cardiovascular  diseases. 
However,  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  association 
between smoking and obesity remain unclear. Conflicting 
results  so  far  are  thought  to  stem  from  the  multiple 
confounding structure of smoking and other obesogenic 
life style characteristics. 
Methods:  Cotwin control study is a genomic epidemiology 
design,  in  which  the  other twin  (=cotwin)  serves  as  a 
control  of the twin.  Cotwin control  study,  discordant for 
smoking habits can provide powerful evidence of association 
between  smoking  and  obesity by completely  matching 
genomic information, intrauterine environment, and almost 
all  environmental  factors.  We  selected  3,697  like-sex 
twin  pairs  (2,762  male  and  935  female  pairs)  out  of 
63,666 pairs of adult twins in the existing Korea Twin and 
Family Register, whose smoking  habits are discordant. 
We used the information of obesity as body mass index 
(BMI,  kglm\  blood  pressure,  and  blood  cholesterol 
level  at the time or later than the smoking  information. 
Paired t-test was done to compare the smoking effects. 
Results: Lifetime smoking rate was 80.1% ( 4 7.9 current 
smoker)  for  men  and  10%  (1.7%  current  smoker)  for

women. Among 2,762 and 935 male and female like-sex 
twin pairs, 363 male pairs and 20 female pairs correspond 
to  the  definition  of  smoker-nonsmoker  pair.  The  male 
smokers  demonstrated  increase  in  BMI  by 0.47,  while 
female smokers show slight decrease (by 0.13),  which 
were  not  statistically  significant.  Diastolic  and  systolic 
blood pressure, and cholesterol level were slightly increased 
among  smokers  by  1.85 mmHg,0.62  mmHg,  and  1.28 
mg/dl for men.  For women, the results show increase in 
diastolic  blood  pressure  (3.42mmHg)  and  cholesterol 
level (1.25 mgldl), and systolic pressure (8.17 mmHg). 
Conclusion: The results refute the possibility that smoking 
can reduce BMI. Considering the direct adverse effect of 
smoking,  it  should  be  emphasized that smoking  do not 
decrease  obesity  and  thus  increase  overall  metabolic 
syndrome.

Introduction 
Monozygotic twins share all the genomic information, as 
well  as  intrauterine,  development,  and  almost  other 
environments.  If  a  pair  is  discordant  for  certain  risk 
factors  such  as smoking,  any  health  status  of the pair 
can be easily interpreted to stem from the discordant risk 
factor.  The  study  design  using  the  twins,  particularly 
monozygotic twins discordant for  risk factors  or health 
outcomes  is  called  cotwin  control  study  (Duffy,  2000}. 
The cotwin is the ideal control and no other controls can 
come close to it, no matter how well-matched it would be. 
The cotwin control study design is particularly powerful in 
examining environmental factors of common complex 
human diseases, where multiple genes and environments 
contribute to the etiology of diseases. Consider an example 
of  orchestra,  when  the  background  harmony  is  very 
strong,  the only way to hear the pure tune of piccolo is 
cancelling the background sounds by complete matching. 
The perfect matching of twins can offer this same effect, 
to detect even smaller difference between the cotwins. 
The  health  effects  of  smoking  are  relatively  well 
documented. However, the smoking effects on the obesity 
has  reported  conflicting  findings,  which  reported  that 
smoking was decreasing the weight (Nichter eta/., 2004), 
that the  countries  where  smoking  rate  decrease  show 

increase in obesity prevalence (Gruber eta/., 2005), and 
that the  smoking  the  social  groups which  have  higher 
smoking  rate  also  showed  higher  obesity  prevalence 
(Zimlichman  eta/.,  2005).  Recently  studies  focus  on 
various  risk  factors  of  metabolic  syndrome  or specific 
sub-type of obesity such  as central  or visceral  obesity 
(Canoy eta/., 2005; Mizuno eta/., 2005). The discrepancy 
between  studies  may  stem  from  1) 
the  different 
measurements of obesity, 2) temporal relationship between 
smoking  and  obesity-related  traits,  3)  socioeconomic 
variables control, 4) complex and sometimes unpredictable 
inter-correlation  between  smoking  and  the  risks  of 
obesity,  such  as  physical  activity,  diet,  and  so  on.  In 
addition  the  various  risk  factors  of obesity  are  rapidly 
changing as is the smoking rate across the populations. 
Obesity is determined by a range of life style, multiple 
genetic factors, and intrauterine environments (Dabelea 
eta/., 2000;  Breier eta/., 2001).  Such complicated  risk 
factors can not be easily controlled to see the purer effects 
of smoking. We attempted to examine the common belief 
that smoking may reduce the weight through twin study. 
In  addition,  we  would  like  to  examine  the  effect  of 
smoking on other risk factors of metabolic syndrome. 

Methods 
Subjects 
This study used the Korean Twin Registry. We selected 
twins who are discordant for smoking habits among the 
adult  twins  of  the  registry  (127,332  persons,  63,666 
pairs). The twins in the registry are representing Korean 
population,  and  further  description  was  reported  in 
previous  paper  (Sung  et  a/.,  2002).  We  limited  the 
like-sex twins who have taken health examinations more 
than twice between the  1986 and 2004,  and also have 
the information on smoking habits. In addition we further 
selected for those twin pairs who took health examination 
with less than 2 years difference between the cotwins, to 
insure the minimal age effects. Because we did not have 
genomic information regarding the exact zygosity of the 
subjects, we excluded twin pairs whose height difference 
was more than 3 centimeter in the twin pair. The limitation 
of  height  difference  can  control  not  only the  dizygotic 
twins,  but also for monozygotic twins  who had  distinct 
differences in the intrauterine environments.  If there are 
twin-to-twin transfusion  syndromes or other conditions 
which  may  result  in  more  than  15%  of  birth  weight 
difference,  the  twins  might  have  different  physique, 
which cannot be attributable to the smoking effects. 

Smoking, Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome  167 

including 

two  questions  about 

National Health Insurance, the subjects are asked brief 
questionnaire 
their 
smoking habits. We only determined the smoking habits 
when the individual took health examination more than 
two times,  and more than two answers for the smoking 
habits.  Smoking  habits  were  classified 
into  three 
categories  1)  if  the  responses  were  all  non-smoking 
from  more than two questionnaires,  one was classified 
as "never-smoker" 2) if the information of the last health 
examination was put as smoker,  one was classified as 
"current smoker",  3)  if the information of the last health 
examination was put as quitter, or the last information is 
put as non-smoking but previous records suggested to 
be a smoker, one was classified "past-smoker".  If there 
is any ambiguity or conflicts between the information of 
an individual about smoking habits, it was excluded from 
analysis.  All  the smoking  habits were  measured within 
two years difference within each pair 

Obesity and other risk factors 
The data source of obesity and risk factors of metabolic 
syndrome were same with that of smoking. Obesity was 
measured as body mass index (BMI, kg!m\ calculated 
by the body weight (kilogram) divided by the square of 
height (meter). Among the longitudinal data, the data at 
the moment when last smoking information was selected 
for  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  (mmHg)  and 
total serum cholesterol level (mg/dl), along with BMI. The 
details of the methods used to measure blood pressure, 
BMI,  and  cholesterol  level  were  reported  in  previous 
study (Song eta/., 2003). 

Analysis 
Paired t-test was used to compare the effect of smoking 
between  smoker and  non-smoker cotwins  by the  sex. 
Only the current smoker and  never smoker categories 
were used for this analysis to see the effect of smoking, 
not mixed with the effect of cessation. We also limited the 
analysis for those pairs whose height difference is less 
than 3 centimeters. No specific adjustment was considered 
for  age  or other covariates.  In  the  analysis  of  intrapair 
difference, any adjustment modifies the pairwise variation, 
rather than the absolute mean levels, different from what 
we intended. We examined whether the intrapair difference 
showed any residual association with other covariates.

have longitudinal smoking information, and the intrapair 
difference of age for the last health examination should 
be  less  than  2  year.  Among  them  for  men,  80.1% 
experienced smoking during lifetime, and 47.9% of them 
were  classified  as  current  smoker  for  women  1 0% 
experienced  smoking  and  1.7% of  them  were  current 
smokers.  There  were  363  current  smokers  - never 
smoker pairs  for men  and  20 current smokers  - never 
smoker pairs for women. The smoking discordant rate for 
men, from three by three tables, categorized by current 
smoker,  quitter,  and  never smoker,  was  52.5%.  If  we 
exclude quitters to make two by two tables of current -
never smoker, the discordant rate fell to 13.1% for men. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  smoking  discordant  rate  for 
women was much lower 15.7% in the three by three table, 
and 2.1% in two by two table. (Table 1) When we limited 
the twin pairs by the difference in the height ( <3 em), there 
were 219 male pairs and 12 female pairs discordant for 
their smoking habits (current smoker and never smoker). 
The average age was 37.5 (standard deviation, SD 7.7) 
for  men  and  32.7  (SD  13.5)  for  women  among  those 
219/12 pairs. 

lntrapair difference of BMI  does not show significant 
correlation  with  the  increase  of  age  or  height,  which 
confirmed  that  further  adjustment  for  age  or  other 
covariates are not necessary (Fig.  1). 

When  we compared the  body  mass index between 
current  smoker and  never smoker,  for the  male twins, 
smoker  demonstrated  significantly  increased  BMI  by 
0.46  (p=0.01 ),  while  for  female  twins  smoker  showed 
small  decrease  of  0.12  (BMI,  p=0.81),  which  was  not 
statistically significant. 

For  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  level,  smoker 
cotwins show uniform increase for all risk factors in both 
sexes  systolic  blood  pressure  1.8,  diastolic  blood 
pressure 0.6 mmHg, and total cholesterol lever 1.3 mg/dl 
for  men  systolic  blood  pressure  3.5,  diastolic  blood

Discussion 
Cotwin control study design 
The  study  analyzed  like-sex  twin  pairs  discordant  for 
smoking. Original suggestion of cotwin control study was 
intended for monozygotic twins rather than like-sex twins. 
Since monozygotic twins split from one fertilized ovum, 
all the genomic information is shared.  For monozygotic 
twins, additive genetic effects, as well as dominant genetic 
effects are shared 100%. Also monozygotic twins share 
intrauterine, maternal, and developmental environments. 
On  the  other  hand,  dizygotic  twins  share  the  same 
amount of genetic constitution as the ordinary siblings do. 
Dizygotic twins share 50% of additive genetic effects and 
only 25% of dominant genetic effects.  Since we did not 
have  exact  zygosity  information  of  the  like-sex  twins, 
there could be certain amount of dizygotic twins,  which 
can be predicted by the number of opposite-sex twins. 
The  study  highly  selected  the  subjects  to  see  the 
discordant effects. This selection made it impossible to 
project or model the zygosity structure based on population 
level  like-sex  and  opposite-sex  twin  pairs,  using  the 
subtraction rule of Weinberg (Sung eta/., 2002). The only 
way we could further exclude the possible dizygotic twins 
were  to  exclude  those  pairs  whose  height  differences 
were greater than 3 em. The height shows higher heritability 
than  weight,  ranging  60-80%  of  genetic  contribution 
(Silventoinen  eta/.,  2003).  If  we  apply  this  heritability 
value, the intrapair correlation of heights for monozygotic 
twins  should  higher  than  that  of  dizygotic  twins  by 
30-40%. The maximal height difference in the first 363/20 
pairs were as large as 19 em. We expect that applying the

limitation  for  height  difference  should  have  excluded 
some dizygotic twin pairs. Also the height difference could 
have excluded a rare but influential monozygotic pairs, 
who had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome or whose birth 
weight differed greatly with out the twin-to-twin transfusion 
syndrome. There were several reports that even among 
monozygotic twins, there were about 2-5% of twin pairs 
whose  birth  weight  difference  exceeds  15%  (Machin, 
1996). The large birth weight gap usually can not caught 
up along the growth, and the shorter cotwin have higher 
risk of metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease and 
stroke  (McMillen  and  Robinson,  2005).  Thus,  applying 
height  difference  limits  can  not  only  reduce  possible 
dizygotic  twins,  but  monozygotic  twins  who  had  large 
birth weight gap, thus reducing the noise from intrauterine 
effects, to see the purer effect of smoking habits. 

As  we  described  in  methods,  the  study  did  not 
discriminate monozygotes and dizygotes by standardized 
test  using  7-8 short tandem  repeated  markers.  Even  if 
we  only  selected  like-sex  twins  and  applied  height 
difference limit, there may be certain amount of dizygotic 
twins mixed together. However the misclassification can 
not be differential in terms of obesity or smoking status. 
We  think  the  study  results  were  not  drawn  from  the 
residuals of random misclassification. 

other purposes. We could not directly confirm the validity 
or  reliability  of  the  data  sources.  We  only  used  the 
longitudinal data,  not sporadic data, for smoking habits. 
The  average  number  of  health  examination  for  each 
individual  was  4.7  times  during  the  study  period.  We 
excluded any ambiguous or conflicting information across 
longitudinal  information.  The  Korean  National  Health 
Service data has been successfully reported several new 
findings,  which  were  highly  compatible  with  other 
important studies (Mizuno et at.,  2005).  We believe the 
validity and reliability of measures used in the study is as 
good as other studies. 

However, in the study, since we could not accurately 
evaluate the starting point of smoking, we only used the 
information  of  smoker  or  not.  We  did  not  analyze  the 
obesity according to cumulative amount of smoking such 
as pack-year, or the first age at smoking, etc. The relatively 
small  difference  in  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol  level 
could  have  been  stem  from  the  loss  of the cumulative 
smoking amount. 

Similarly, although we could classify the "quitters," it 
was  not  possible  to  detect  exact  time  when  they  quit 
smoking.  We  did  not  analyzed  the  effect  of  smoking 
cessation  which  is  another  important  issue  regarding 
smoking. The effect of smoking cessation may need to 
be elucidated with longer follow-up data. 

Measurements 
The study used data sources which were collected for 

Sex difference in smoking discordant rate 
The effective sample size showed severe sex disequilibrium 

170  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  3(4)  166-171, December2005 

219 male and 12 female pairs. The overall like-sex twin 
pairs who had smoking information were 2, 762 male and 
935 female (less than 3 sex ratio). The simple discordant 
rate show big difference between two sexes 13.1% male, 
and  2. 1%  female.  The  big  difference  came  from  the 
large difference in the smoking rate (45.7% and  1.7%). 
When  we  calculated  Cohen's  kappa  value  which  can 
adjust the difference in smoking rate, male pairs showed 
Cohen'  kappa value of +0.24 (95% Cl  0.22-0.26), while 
female showed kappa value of +017 (95% Cl 0.11-0.24). 
The kappa value results show that most of the discordant 
rate can be explained by the difference in smoking rate. 
There  is  nosex  difference  in  other  aspects,  and  the 
results of the study can be compared between the sexes. 
The smoking rate in the study was rather lower than 
the general populations, which show 64.5% for men and 
4.7% for women (KIHASA, 2002a).  Even if we count in 
the  decreasing  smoking  rate  and  2-year  time  gap 
between the report and the study,  10-15% of difference 
in  smoking  rate  can  not  be  explained.  We  think  the 
difference  was  made  from  the  abundance  of  public 
service workers  in  the cohort,  rather than  the fact that 
twins show lower smoking rate than general populations. 
The smoking  rate  of public servants were  much  lower 
than  that  of  general  popufB.tTon--there  was  a  report  in 
2002,  saying  43.3% and 0.8% of men  and  women are 
smokers among the  public servants  (KIHASA,  2002b). 
Considering  that  the  smoking  rate  in  the  study  is 
between the smoking rate of general population and that 
of public servants,  we do not believe the smoking rates 
in the study were underestimated. 

Sex difference 
The study shows sex difference in the smoking effect on 
obesity.  Men  showed  significant  BMI  increase  among 
the  smokers,  while  women  showed  insignificant  but 
small  decrease.  It is  impossible to  decide whether this 
was true sex difference or the effect for women was less 
reliable  owing  to  large  confidence  intervals.  Over  all 
effects  showed  good  concordance  between  men  and 
women,  especially  for  blood  pressure  and  cholesterol 
levels. The possible sex difference in the smoking effects 
on obesity should be followed-up to see the authenticity 
of  the  results.  Given  the  low  smoking  rate  among 
women,  it  should be supported  by other study designs 
such as cohort studies. 

Strengths and limitations 
The study used a large twin  registry,  which  represents 
Korean population. The results of the study can be easily 
generalized  and  applied  to  general  population.  Each 

health  examination  data was  measured  independently 
during  18 years.  By  using  all  the  longitudinal  data,  we 
believe the validity and  reliability of the measurements 
can  be  appropriate  for  study  purposes.  The  cotwin 
control  study design adopted  in  the  study has  specific 
strength in detecting and interpreting the environmental 
effects,  minimizing the noise from confounding factors, 
such as genomic background, other life styles, intrauterine 
environments, etc. 

However, although this study applied the limitation of 
height difference to reduce dizygotic twins, the zygosity 
discrimination was not performed by standard methods 
using  genotype  information.  This  could  have  caused 
certain amount of uncertainty in the results. The smoking 
rate of women was very low among Korean population, 
which resulted in very small female twin pairs discordant 
for  smoking  habits.  The  small  sample  size  made  the 
confidence intervals of results wider for women. We only 
measured obesity in  terms of BMI.  There were several 
reports saying smoking habits are specifically associated 
with  sub-types  of  obesity,  such  as  central  obesity  or 
visceral obesity (Duffy, 2000; KIHASA, 2002b). We could 
not produce data on these specific obesity measures. 

Conclusion 
We concluded that the common belief that smoking may 
help  reduce  the  body  weight  has  no  scientific  base. 
Conversely,  the  smoking  significantly  increased  the 
obesity in men.  If we consider the other adverse effects 
on the riskfactors of metabolic syndrome, such as blood 
pressure and total serum cholesterol levels, the smoking 
effects on obesity should be amplified in terms of overall 
health  risk.  If  smoking  does  not  decrease  the  obesity 
itself  or  actually  increase  it,  the  smoking  cessation 
campaign can utilize the evidence to increase the effect 
of public health intervention.
