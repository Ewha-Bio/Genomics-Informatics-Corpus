Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene has been widely used for the classification of microorganisms. However, we have 
been unable to clearly identify five Flavobacterium species isolated from a freshwater by using the gene as a single marker, 
because the evolutionary history is incomplete and the pace of DNA substitutions is relatively rapid in the bacteria. In this 
study, we tried to classify Flavobacterium species through multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), which is a practical and 
reliable technique for the identification or classification of bacteria. The five Flavobacterium species isolated from freshwater 
and 37 other strains were classified based on six housekeeping genes: gyrB, dnaK, tuf, murG, atpA, and glyA. The genes were 
amplified  by  PCR  and  subjected  to  DNA  sequencing.  Based  on  the  combined  DNA  sequence  (4,412  bp)  of  the  six 
housekeeping genes, we analyzed the phylogenetic relationship among the Flavobacterium species. The results indicated 
that  MLSA,  based  on  the  six  housekeeping  genes,  is  a  trustworthy  method  for  the  identification  of  closely  related 
Flavobacterium species.

Introduction

Flavobacterium  is  a  genus  of  gram-negative  bacteria 
belonging  to  the  family  Flavobacteriaceae  (order:  Flavo-
bacteriales, class: Flavobacteria, phylum: Bacteroidetes) [1]. 
The term Flavobacterium was first introduced by Bergey et al. 
in 1923 [1]. Since then, a number of Flavobacterium species 
have been identified, and the classification of the genus has 
been continuously amended. At present, it is widely accepted 
that  the  genus  Flavobacterium  contains  bacteria  that  are 
yellow-pigmented,  aerobic,  and  generally  rod-shaped  [2], 
and some Flavobacterium species mobilize through a gliding 
motility  mechanism  [3].  Flavobacterium  strains  could  be 
isolated  from  various  habitats,  including  freshwater,  soil, 
plants, and food [3, 4].

The 16S rRNA gene has been widely used in many studies 
concerned with the identification or classification of micro-
organisms. However, using only one housekeeping gene as a 
single marker is not enough to distinguish some bacterial 

species, especially when they are closely related. In addition, 
gene-specific changes caused by horizontal gene transfer or 
recombination  could  be  an  obstacle  to  the  phylogenetic 
studies that are based on a single gene marker [5, 6]. To 
overcome  the  limitation,  multilocus  sequence  analysis 
(MLSA) has been proposed as an alternative method in many 
studies. In reality, MLSA is a microbial genotyping method 
used to characterize a variety of microorganisms, including 
the  genera of  Pantoea  [7], Bifidobacterium  [8],  Borrelia  [9], 
Bradyrhizobium [10], and Bacteroides [11]. In MLSA, appro-
ximately  seven  housekeeping  genes  are  required,  but  a 
standard for the given number and size of genes has not been 
established. This concise approach is based on concatenated 
sequences of multiple housekeeping genes, uses the con-
catenated sequences to identify the phylogenetic aspects of 
desired species, and investigates the patterns of genotypes 
between each species cluster [12].

This study was designed to classify the genetic diversity of 
collected Flavobacterium species. In addition, we also inve-

compared the results for phylogenetic markers.

Methods
Bacterial isolates

Seven  Flavobacterium  isolates  were  collected.  The  two 
Flavobacterium reference strains, F. aquatile ATCC 11947 and 
F. frigidimaris F3-JCM12218, were purchased from the Japan 
Collection of Microorganisms (JCM), and five Flavobacterium 
isolates－F. koreense ARSA-15, F. koreense ARSA-19, F. koreense 
ARSA-42,  F.  chungnamense  ARSA-103,  and  F.  chungnamense 
ARSA-108－were  previously  isolated  from  the  Cheon-ho 
reservoir in the Korea [13, 14].

Bacterial growth and genomic DNA isolation

This seven strains were cultured on R2A medium (Difco, 
Detroit, MI, USA) for 5 days at 25oC and produced cream- 
yellow,  semi-transparent  colonies.  We  extracted  genomic 
DNA from the seven Flavobacterium strains using the Wizard 
genomic  DNA  purification  kit  (Promega,  Madison,  WI, 
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Polymerase chain reaction

Through a PCR assay, we amplified seven housekeeping 
genes from the bacteria: 16S rRNA (16S ribosomal RNA) 
gene, atpA (ATP synthase alpha subunit), dnaK (molecular 
chaperone  protein),  glyA  (serine  hydroxy-methyltrans-
ferase), gyrB (DNA gyrase, subunit B), murG (N-acetylglu-
cosaminyl transferase), and tuf (elongation factor Tu). For 
the  PCR  amplification  of  the  genes,  we  used  primers 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

designed in a previous study [15]. However, we failed to 
amplify  the  dnaK  and  atpA  genes  through  PCR  with  the 
previously designed primers. Thus, we manually designed 
new PCR primers to amplify these two genes. The primers 
are listed in Table 1. PCR amplification of each gene was 
performed in a 25-μL reaction volume using 10 μL of a DNA 
polymerase kit (TaKaRa EmeraldAmp GT PCR Master Mix; 
TaKaRa,  Ohtsu,  Japan),  200  nM  of  each  oligonucleotide 
primer, and 50 ng of template DNA. The PCR conditions 
were an initial denaturation at 95oC for 5 min; followed by 35 
cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 95oC, 30 s of annealing at 
55oC, and 2 min of extension at 72oC; and followed by 5 min 
of a final extension at 72oC. Two microliters of the resulting 
PCR products was loaded on a 1%  agarose gel, stained with 
ethidium bromide, and visualized using UV fluorescence. 
The remaining PCR products were purified with the Wizard 
SV  gel  and  PCR  clean-up  kit  (Promega,  Madison,  USA) 
according to the manufacturer’s instruction and sequenced 
on  an  ABI  3130XL  automated  DNA  sequencer  (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

DNA sequences analysis

For  each  of  the  seven  genes,  we  aligned  the  DNA 
sequences obtained from the seven Flavobacterium isolates 
using the software BioEdit, version 7.0 (http://www.mbio. 
ncsu.edu/Bioedit/bioedit.html/). After that, the housekeep-
ing gene sequences of the 14 added reference strains were 
collected using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and 
aligned in the same way.

Phylogenetic analysis

To  construct  the  phylogenetic  relationship  of  the  21 
Flavobacterium strains, we used the molecular evolutionary 
genetics  analysis (MEGA) software package, version 5.05 
[16], with the Kimura two-parameter model and bootstrap 
analyses,  based  on  1,000  replications.  In  addition,  we 
compared  the  genetic  similarity  of  the  six  housekeeping 
genes  and  the  16S  rRNA  gene  between  the  genus  of 
Flavobacterium  using  the  pair  distance  of  ClustalW 
(weighted), which was supported by DNASTAR’s MegAlign 
program  in  Lasergene,  version  5.0  (http://www.dnastar. 
com). The MEGA program was also used to determine the 
pairwise distances, G+C contents, and substitution posi-
tions.

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

The DNA sequences of the seven amplified Flavobacterium 
isolates have been deposited in GenBank under accession 
numbers JX256829-JX256870 (Supplementary Table 1).

Results and Discussion

In this study, to determine the phylogenetic relationship 
of the five closely related Flavobacterium species that were 

previously isolated from a freshwater reservoir in Chonan, 
Korea [13, 14], we constructed a maximum-liklihood phylo-
genetic tree, but the tree showed a very low bootstrap value 
(＜25%)  between  them.  Previously,  Nicolas  et  al.  [15] 
recommended  several  housekeeping  genes  to  analyze  the 
phylogenetic relationship among fish-pathogenic F. psychro-
philum strains. This approach is called MLSA, which is very 
useful for distinguishing closely related species and showing 
population structure. We have chosen seven housekeeping 
genes  as  phylogenetic  markers－atpA,  dnaK,  glyA,  gyrB, 
murG, tuf (elongation factor Tu), and trpB (tryptophan syn-
thase,  subunit  B)－because  these  loci  contain  the  largest 
amounts of polymorphisms among the 50 F. psychrophilum 
strains [15].

This  study  is  the  first  to  apply  Flavobacterium  species 
isolated  from  a  freshwater  reservoir.  First,  we  tried  to 
amplify seven housekeeping genes from five Flavobacterium 
isolates  [13,  14],  which  are  closely  related  to  each  other 
based on the 16S rRNA gene. However, we could not amplify 
the trpB gene from our samples from a freshwater reservoir. 
Therefore, we collected the sequences of six housekeeping 
genes  and  the  16S  rRNA  gene  from  five  Flavobacterium 
isolates  [13,  14],  isolated  from  a  freshwater  reservoir  in 
Cheonan, Korea, and two Flavobacterium reference strains, F. 
aquatile  ATCC  11947  and  F.  frigidimaris  F3-JCM122,  as

interspecies out-groups. In addition, we searched for more 
Flavobacterium  species  that  were  available  for  the  six 
housekeeping genes from the GenBank database. We found 
that  52  Flavobacterium  species  were  available  for  all  six 
housekeeping gene sequences in the database. Among them, 
50  Flavobacterium  species  were  F.  psychrophilum  that  were 
identified  and  studied  by  Nicolas  et  al.  [15].  The  50  F. 
psychrophila  were  assigned  to  33  sequence  types.  Conse-
quently, to evaluate the resolution and efficiency of MLSA, 
we aligned and trimmed each housekeeping gene sequence 
(555 bp of gyrB, 680 bp of dnaK, 833 bp of tuf, 725 bp of murG, 
796 bp of atpA, and 823 bp of glyA genes) from the five 
Flavobacterium isolates, 33 distinct F. psychrophila, two other 
Flavobacterium species (F. branchiophilum FL-15 and F. indicum 
GPTSA100-9), and two reference strains. As shown in Fig. 1, 
we constructed two different phylogenetic trees of the Flavo-
bacterium species, based on only 16S rRNA gene sequences 
(Fig. 1A) and based on the concatenated sequences of the six 
housekeeping genes (Fig. 1B). The bootstrap values of the 
tree branches  clearly  improved  in  Fig. 1B  compared with 
those in Fig. 1A. Therefore, we could state that the phylo-
genetic  tree  of  the  genus  Flavobacterium,  produced  by  the 
MLSA approach, is more reliable than the tree based on a 
single locus (e.g., 16S rRNA gene).

To investigate the nucleotide diversity of each gene among 
the  10  Flavobacterium  species,  we  analyzed  the  pairwise 
distances determined by MEGA5.05 (Table 2). Among the 
six housekeeping genes and the 16S rRNA gene, the highest 
average  pairwise  distance  was  0.303  in  murG,  while  the 
lowest average pairwise distance was 0.043 in the 16S rRNA 
gene. We found that the average pairwise distance within the 
gyrB, dnaK, tuf, atpA, and glyA genes was 0.218, 0.141, 0.115, 
0.150, and 0.215, respectively, among Flavobacterium species. 
In addition, we estimated the pairwise distance of the six 
concatenated housekeeping genes, and thus, the pairwise 
distance was 0.164 on average. The pairwise distance of the 
six  concatenated  housekeeping  genes  was  significantly 
greater than the pairwise distance of the 16S rRNA gene

(0.043).  Next,  we  analyzed  G  +  C  contents  and  variable 
nucleotide sites of six housekeeping genes in our MLSA data 
and 16S rRNA gene (Table 2). The G + C contents of the 
genes  ranged  from  35.4%  (murG)  to  48.9%  (16S  rRNA) 
(Table 2). The G + C content among housekeeping genes 
was found to be variable.

As a result, this study has demonstrated that MLSA, based 
on  multiloci,  produces  more  reliable  phylogenetic  trees 
among Flavobacterium species compared with the tree based 
on a single locus (e.g., 16S rRNA). When a high number of 
sequential similarities exist in genetic markers, it might be 
difficult to identify the phylogenetic relationship between 
microorganisms of the same genus. Therefore, MLSA will be 
a good approach to classify the genetic relationships among 
microorganisms.
