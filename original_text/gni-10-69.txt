The  explosive  development  of  genomics  technologies  including  microarrays  and  next  generation  sequencing  (NGS)  has 
provided comprehensive maps of cancer genomes, including the expression of mRNAs and microRNAs, DNA copy numbers, 
sequence  variations,  and  epigenetic  changes.  These  genome-wide  profiles  of  the  genetic  aberrations  could  reveal  the 
candidates  for  diagnostic  and/or  prognostic  biomarkers  as  well  as  mechanistic  insights  into  tumor  development  and 
progression. Recent efforts to establish the huge cancer genome compendium and integrative omics analyses, so-called 
”integromics“,  have  extended  our  understanding  on  the  cancer  genome,  showing  its  daunting  complexity  and 
heterogeneity. However, the challenges of the structured integration, sharing, and interpretation of the big omics data still 
remain  to  be  resolved.  Here,  we  review  several  issues  raised  in  cancer  omics  data  analysis,  including  NGS,  focusing 
particularly on the study design and analysis strategies. This might be helpful to understand the current trends and strategies 
of the rapidly evolving cancer genomics research.

Introduction

In the last decade, numerous genomic studies have ad-
dressed  the  enormous  complexity  of  the  cancer  genome. 
Genomic  profiling  using  microarray  technology  could 
stratify the tumors into homogeneous subgroups, providing 
novel clinical insights for the development of diagnostics and 
therapeutics as well as systematic views on the underlying 
mechanisms  of  tumor  progression.  In  addition  to  the 
microarray technologies, explosive advances on sequencing 
technologies have been made recently, which is called “next 
generation sequencing (NGS).” Compared to the previous 
DNA  sequencing  of  the  Sanger  method  using  dideo-
xynucleotide  termination  reaction  termed  as  “first-ge-
neration” sequencing, NGS uses massively parallel sequen-
cing method generating hundreds of millions of short (~200 
bp)  DNA  reads,  which  can  sequence  a  human  genome 
rapidly with extremely lower cost. The earlier NGS method 
with the single-end read sequencing inevitably produces the 
short-read  problems,  limiting  the  accuracy  of  genome 
alignment. This could be improved by applying a paired-end 

sequencing  method,  allowing  substantial  advances  in 
identifying  not  only  point  mutations  but  also  genomic 
rearrangements,  such  as  deletions,  amplifications,  inver-
sions, translocations, and gene-fusions [1, 2]. 

The  NGS  technology  is  now  divided  into  “second  ge-
neration  sequencing”  and  “third  generation  sequencing.” 
The second generation sequencing refers to the strategies of 
short-read  alignment,  while  the  rapidly  being  developed 
technology of the third generation sequencing refers to the 
single  DNA  molecule  based  sequencing.  The  third  gene-
ration method has advantage of less amount of DNA input 
that allows the emerging field of single cell sequencing [3]. 
Moreover, there is no step for PCR amplification, therefore, 
the nucleotide incorporation errors can be handled. 

However, all the platforms of NGS technologies still have 
limitations  in  accurate  base  calling  and  alignment.  The 
errors are likely to be platform-dependent, which increases 
the complexity of the data analysis. Therefore, the cost for 
bioinformatic  analysis,  rather  than  the  sequencing  itself 
continues  to  grow,  which  is  referred  to  as  “the  $1,000 
genomes, the $100,000 analysis” problem [4].

Cancer Genome Analysis with NGS Techno-
logies

The application of Exome-Seq and Whole Genome-Seq 
profiled a mutational spectrum in various cancers [5-8]. The 
RNA-Seq could profile not only the gene expressions but 
also new parameters such as allelic expression, alternative 
splicing [9, 10], RNA-editing [11], and alternative polya-
denylation  of  3'-untranaslated  region  (3'-UTR)  [12,  13]. 
Structural variations such as gene-fusions, e.g., TMPRSS2- 
ERG in prostate cancer [14] and KIF5B-RET in lung cancer 
[15] have been identified from the analysis of NGS data. 
Moreover, the patterns of genome rearrangements can be 
analyzed  systematically.  For  example,  a  novel  pattern  of 
genomic rearrangement such as fold-back inversion could be 
found by simply examining the short read alignment of NGS 
data [16]. A novel mechanism of cancer genome rearran-
gement  i.e.,  chromothripsis  has  been  proposed,  which 
represent a catastrophic event of fragmentation and reas-
sembly  of  a  single  chromosome  [17].  In  addition,  high- 
resolution epigenomic profiles of cancer genome could be 
obtained by applying NGS to chromatin immunoprecipita-
tion-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and methylated DNA immuno-
precipitation-sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). For example, a re-
cent  study  of  the  genome-wide  DNA  methylation  profile 
showed  novel  patterns  in  which  the  majority  of  DNA 
methylation  changes  occurs  at  CpG  island  shores  neigh-
boring the regions up to 2 Kb from CpG islands, and revealed 
the  patterns  of  cancer-specific  and  tissue-specific  DNA 
methylation  [18,  19].  Aberrant  histone  modification  was 
also  found  in  cancers  showing  an  association  with  the 
patient’s prognosis [20]. These studies support the pivotal 
role  of  epigenetic  regulation  in  cancer  development  and 
progression.  Moving  forward,  new  applications  such  as 
genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS) [21] and 
translocation  capture  sequencing  (TC-Seq)  [22]  have 
recently been proposed, which could profile the genome- 
wide translocation hotspots. 

Notably, the advantage of NGS is not restricted to these 
applications.  It serves  a platform for the identification  of 
novel  RNAs  or  DNAs.  For  example,  the  long  noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from intergenic and 
intronic regions have been identified in prostate cancers i.e., 
prostate cancer-associated ncRNA transcripts (PCATs) [23]. 
A novel class of DNA i.e., extrachromosomal microDNA, 
has been recently found by NGS technology, which is derived 
from unique non-repetitive sequence enriched in 5'-UTR, 
exons,  and  CpG  islands  [24].  The  role  of  microDNA  in 
cancer will be the next question.

Challenges in cancer genomics 

The  primary  study  goals  of  cancer  genomics  are  not 
simple, which include the studies to get either clinical or 
mechanistic insights from the cancer genome. To clarify the 
complicated  study  designs  and  strategies  of  cancer  geno-
mics, we have categorized the gene signatures obtained from 
cancer genome data into four classes prediction, phenotype, 
function,  and molecular  targets based on the study  goals 
[25]. The majority of the previous studies have suggested 
the translational or clinical utility of the genomics data by 
addressing the candidate biomarkers or the prediction signa-
tures for predicting patients clinical outcomes, such as recur-
rence, survival, metastasis, or response to therapies. Not-
withstanding the overwhelming identification of candidate 
biomarkers from the cancer genome, only a handful of can-
didate biomarkers that have been discovered from genomic 
analyses can succeed in the validation of the clinical utility 
[18]. There are several challenges in cancer genomics that 
preclude clinical utility. One of them would be data repro-
ducibility. They might be due in part to the experimental 
biases as well as sample cohort issues. The use of different 
platforms  measuring  gene  expressions  and  different  data 
processing  methods  could  produce  biased  observation  in 
each  study.  Increasing  sample  size  will  be  one  of  the 
solutions to find proper biomarkers, overcoming the repro-
ducibility problem. Undoubtedly, large-scale sample collec-
tion provides increased statistical power. However, previous 
studies, even with large sample sizes, have often failed to 
reproduce their findings in independent studies [26]. This 
might be due mostly to the use of different protocols and 
analysis methods. Moreover, biased sample collection may 
also  affect  the  performance  of  prognostic  biomarkers, 
leading to subsequent failure to validate the biomarker in 
another  patient  population  [27].  For  example,  diagnostic 
biomarkers  must  be  discovered  in  early-stage  tumors; 
however, the sample collection of early tumors with enough 
of a sample size might be difficult in the clinical setting [18, 
28]. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of the sample size 
enrolled in a study should be considered. Simply increasing 
the sample size might not be the best solution. 

The  sample  sources  and  qualities  are  also  important 
factors to be considered in the study design. For example, 
circulating DNAs or microRNAs in the plasma or urine can 
be  used  to  develop  “noninvasive”  biomarkers  in  cancer 
patients, which might bring the technology much closer to 
the clinic [29, 30]. Attempts to use formalin-fixed paraffin- 
embedded (FFPE) tissues might also be more applicable to 
the clinic [31], although the quality and the quantity of the 
DNAs  or  RNA  extracts  from  FFPE  or  plasma  are  still 
problematic  for  genomics  studies  requesting  further

elaboration. 

Dissecting the tumor heterogeneity 

The  data  complexity  comes  not  only  from  the  hetero-
geneous or biased sample composition, but also from the 
innate complexity of tumor biology. Previously, mounting 
evidence has shown the enormous heterogeneity of tumors 
at  the  molecular  level.  The  tumor  heterogeneity  can  be 
explained  by  two  hypothetical  models.  One  is  the  clonal 
segregation model with a multi-step process, and the other is 
the  cancer  stem  cell  theory.  The  cancer  stem  cell  model 
describes the heterogeneous cellular origin of cancers from 
primitive  progenitor  cells  to  mature  differentiated  cells, 
which  may  contribute  to  tumor  heterogeneity.  In  this 
context, genomic profiling studies could define the cancer 
subpopulation harboring stem-like traits in various cancer 
types, supporting the cancer stem cell theory [32, 33]. Simi-
larly, we also defined the bilineal trait in a subpopulation of 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  by  comparing  the  gene 
expression profiles of HCC and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) 
[34].  This  result  showed  the  continuous  liver  cancer 
spectrum between HCC and CC, suggesting that stem-like 
or  de-differentiation  traits  may  give  rise  to  the  hetero-
geneous progression of HCC. We also suggested that the 
dysfunction  of  p53  machinery  is  associated  with  the 
acquisition of the stemness trait in HCC [35]. Recently, this 
association  could  be  validated  by  showing  p53  knockout 
mouse model can give rise to bilineal liver cancers [36].    
In addition, various host factors may contribute to tumor 
heterogeneity.  Interactions  of  the  tumor  cells  with  host 
eco-system,  such  as  innate  immune  systems,  or  the 
reactions  of  surrounding  microenvironment  against  the 
tumor may affect the tumor behaviors [37]. Thus, the proper 
detection  of  biomarkers  might  be  difficult  without  con-
sidering the effect of host factors. Furthermore, the intra- 
tumoral heterogeneity of cancers have been notified in detail 
by  genome-wide  sequencing  of  multi-loci  from  the  same 
tumor  [38].  The  comparison  of  primary  and  metastatic 
tumors by single cell sequencing also revealed the sequential 
mutation process during cancer progression [39]. Similarly, 
the comparison of mutations from multiple HCC tumors in 
the  same  patient  could  define  the  evolutionary  lineage 
among  tumors  cells  [40].  Strikingly,  the  development  of 
single-cell  sequencing  technology  could  provide  a  more 
detailed and systematic view on intra-tumoral heterogeneity 
[41, 42]. Of interest, such attempts enabled the construction 
of phylogenic trees from mutational heterogeneity, which 
revealed evolutionary tumor growth opening a new field of 
“cancer evolution”.

Returning to biology for clinical utility

As discussed above, there are many factors contributing to 
tumor heterogeneity, which may impede the discovery of 
new  biomarkers.  Thus,  we  are  now  urgently  in  need  of 
developing  new  strategies  for  biomarker  discovery  from 
cancer genome data. Considering the huge complexity of the 
cancer genome and the limitation of current technologies, it 
would  be  a  reliable  strategy  to  evaluate  the  functional 
relevance of the candidate biomarkers rather than simply 
showing  the  statistical  significance  of  the  association  by 
enrolling  larger  samples  or  applying  more  stringent 
statistics.  Although  the  conventional  strategies  for  bio-
marker discovery do not require the functional significance 
of the candidates [43], current hurdles in cancer genomics 
request a functional validation step in the pipeline of the 
biomarker  discovery.  Our  limited  understanding  of  the 
complexity of cancer biology is a significant challenge for 
translational interpretation of the cancer genome.

Challenges of big data issues and integromics 

More recently, systematic structuring and integration of 
multiple  and  multi-layered  omics  data  resources,  i.e. 
integromics, are thought of a state-of-the-art strategy. The 
recent establishment of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) 
could accelerate and facilitate the integration and sharing of 
cancer genome data [44]. Multi-layered integromics could 
define tumor heterogeneity, revealing pivotal aberrations of 
genetic  events  or  signaling  pathways  [45].  In  parallel, 
genomic  repositories  for  drug  activities  have  been  esta-
blished [46-48]. Linking the profiles of drug sensitivity to 
the  cancer  genome  could  provide  a  powerful  platform  to 
guide rational and personalized cancer therapeutics. 

Now, as genomic data are increasing and accumulating 
enormously, new study designs and analysis strategies for 
integromics might be required, particularly with the context 
of tumor heterogeneity and the discovery of the functional 
biomarkers.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  the  first  step  in  cancer 
integromics is the dissection of tumor heterogeneity. Then, 
the next step will be a recapitulation of the relations between 
clinical/biological phenotypes and molecular genotypes in 
cancer  subpopulations,  which  can  address  novel  functio-
nalities in particular subpopulations of cancers. We suggest 
that  the  discovery  of  reliable  candidate  functional  bio-
markers as well as functional genetic alterations, so-called 
“driver  events”,  can be  achieved  through performing this 
step-by-step  evaluation  of  both  clinical  and  functional 
utilities. This hybrid study design would open an exciting era 
for developing new “functional biomarkers” and preventive/ 
therapeutic strategies with the consideration of biological

Conclusion

We  briefly  reviewed  the  current  challenges  and  per-
spectives  of  integrative  cancer  genomics,  focusing  parti-
cularly on the complexity of omics data and cancer biology. 
Integromic approaches with functional evaluation should be 
considered  even  for  clinical  as  well  as  mechanistic  appli-
cations of cancer genome data. Necessarily, the challenges of 
big data (particularly the NGS platforms) and integromics 
should be considered in the study design. A deep under-
standing  of  both  cancer  biology  and  omics  data  charac-
teristics is necessarily required for successful cancer genome 
analysis. Moving forward, it is clear that progress will come 
through  large-scale,  wide-scope,  and  multi-disciplinary 
collaborations and sharing  systems, which  will  accelerate 
the realization of translational and personalized medicine in 
the near future.
