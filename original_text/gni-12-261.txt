MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known for their role in mRNA silencing via interference pathways. Repetitive elements (REs) share 
several  characteristics  with  endogenous  precursor  miRNAs.  In  this  study,  406  previously  identified  and  1,494  novel 
RE-derived miRNAs were sorted from the GENCODE v.19 database using the RepeatMasker program. They were divided into 
six  major  types,  based  on  their  genomic  structure.  More  novel  RE-derived  miRNAs  were  confirmed  than  identified  as 
RE-derived miRNAs. In conclusion, many miRNAs have not yet been identified, most of which are derived from REs.

Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 
∼22 nucleotides (nt) in length and are single-stranded in 
their  mature  form.  Primary  miRNAs  are  expressed  from 
genomic  regions  and  processed  to  generate  precursor 
miRNAs by Drosha [1]. Precursor miRNAs have a hairpin 
structure; therefore, their sources (or, the genomic loci from 
which they originate) have a palindromic structure [2]. The 
precursor  miRNAs  are  exported  from  the  nucleus  to  the 
cytoplasm and processed into a duplex by Dicer, one of which 
is preferentially loaded into Argonaute (AGO) [1, 3]. Mature 
miRNAs function via the RNA-induced silencing complex 
and AGO protein-mediated binding to the target mRNA by 
complementary base pairing to the 3’ untranslated region 
[4].

Repetitive  elements  (REs)  are interspersed throughout 
the genome, and they increase genomic instability through 
various mechanisms. REs consist of transposable elements 
(TEs) and tandem repeats (e.g., satellite DNA, simple repeat 

DNA). REs can directly impact coding sequences or other 
functional sequences in the host genome as follows. They 
can affect transcription by acting as alternative promoters 
[5-7],  forming  structural  isoforms  through  alternative 
exons,  and  by  providing  polyadenylation  signal  sites  im-
portant  in  transcriptional  termination  [8].  REs  are  also 
important for inhibiting gene expression at the post-trans-
criptional level by producing miRNA sequences [2, 9]. REs 
comprise  paralogous  miRNA  gene  families  and  species- 
specific miRNA gene families [10]. Some miRNAs originate 
from unique genomic sequences, and others originate from 
REs.  Recently,  the  association  of  REs  with  miRNAs  was 
established  in  several  studies  that  demonstrated  connec-
tions between miRNAs and TEs [9, 11, 12]. These studies 
suggest  that  REs  are  important  for  miRNA  origin,  ex-
pression, and regulatory network formation [2, 9, 12-16]. 
Especially, some REs have a palindrome structure, and these 
sequences have great potential to make a precursor miRNA 
form. In previous studies, miniature inverted TE (MITE)- 
derived miRNAs were identified in the human genome [2]. 
As one of the REs, medium reiterated sequences (MERs)

have a palindrome structure in the mammalian genome [17]. 
MERs  were  also  predicted  to  make  miRNAs  [10],  and 
MER-derived  miRNAs  were  confirmed  in  experiments  in 
human  cell  lines  [11].  REs  are  ubiquitous  and  scattered 
throughout  the  host  genome  in  abundant  numbers; 
therefore, these RE families have the possibility of making 
paralogous miRNAs. A MITE-derived miRNA, miR-548, has 
many homologous gene families [18], and a MER-derived 
miRNA, miR-1302, also has many homologous miRNAs in 
the  human genome [10]. Likewise, the  long interspersed 
elements (LINE) element also makes an miRNA precursor 
form by “tail to tail” method [12]. In the case of hsa-miR-28, 
two LINE elements are oppositely oriented and then make 
one miRNA precursor form [15]. Based on these results, we 
separated  miRNAs  in  the  case  of  two  REs  making  one 
miRNA  and  of  a  palindrome  structure  RE  making  one 
miRNA.

REs prefer rapid evolution compared to other genomic 
sequences; RE-derived miRNAs have a tendency to make 
phylogeny-specific  miRNAs  [9].  In  this  respect,  primate- 
specific  Alu-derived  miRNAs  are  primate-specific,  and 
MITE-derived miR-548 was mainly discovered in primates 
[18].  Genomic  duplication  events,  such  as  segmental 
duplications or tandem duplications, also create REs and 
RE-derived miRNAs in animals [19, 20]. Therefore, many 
RE-derived miRNAs were identified in the human, rhesus, 
and mouse genomes [20]. In the plant genome, TE inser-
tions can make both siRNAs and miRNAs, and MITEs have 
an  important  role  in  the  creation  and  evolution  of  novel 
miRNAs  [13].  In  this  respect,  to  analyze  TE-overlapping 
patterns and abundant overlapping TEs with miRNAs in the 
human  genome can  provide  evolutionary  clues in  further 
studies.

In  the  miRBase  database,  55  experimentally  validated 
human miRNA genes derived from TEs are described, and 85 
novel miRNAs are predicted from the potential conserved 
secondary structures of 587 human TEs [9]. However, these 
studies  concentrated  exclusively  on  the  identification  of 
miRNAs containing REs and did not analyze the patterns of 
overlap between REs and miRNAs. Moreover, newly iden-

tified miRNAs and small transcripts with the potential to 
form  miRNAs  have  not  been  considered.  Therefore,  we 
analyzed TEs that overlapped with both previously identified 
and novel miRNAs and examined six patterns of overlap that 
occur. Our results suggest that REs contribute to the pro-
duction of human miRNA genes by a number of mechani-
sms.

Methods
Computational analysis

We used miRNAs annotated as small non-coding RNA 
genes  defined  by  the  GENCODE  database,  v.19  (http:// 
www.gencodegenes.org) [21]. RepeatMasker outputs (hg19 
assembly,  RM  v.330,  repbase  libraries  20120124)  were 
obtained  from  the  University  of  California,  Santa  Cruz 
(UCSC) genome browser (http://genome. ucsc.edu/, hg19). 
To analyze the intersection between miRNA and REs, we 
used the intersectBed command (with options -wa and -wb) 
in BEDTools [22]. 

Classification of miRNAs into six types

The RE-matched precursor miRNA sequences obtained 
were  divided  into  six  major types.  The six  types  were  as 
follows:  miRNAs  that  overlapped  with  two  or  more  REs 
(type 1), miRNAs related to the TcMar-Mariner family (type 
2)  and  the  MER  family  (type  3),  and  miRNAs  sorted 
according  to  the  matching  scheme  between  REs  and 
miRNAs  (type  4  to  type  6).  The  classification  scheme  is 
described in a flow chart (Supplementary Fig. 1). miRNA 
sorting and deletion of duplications were performed using 
Microsoft Excel (Supplementary Table 1). 

Results

human genome

In total, 1,900 miRNAs were confirmed as RE-originated, 
including 406 previously identified miRNAs and 1,494 novel 
miRNAs (Table 1). We identified 452 type 1 miRNAs, which

Fig.  1.  Schematic  of  the  precursor 
miRNAs  derived  from  repetitive  ele-
ments  (REs)  located  in  the  genome. 
REs and precursor miRNAs are shown
as horizontal bold bars and upper thin
bars, respectively. The type 1 precur-
sor miRNAs are formed by two adja-
cent REs (A). Type 2 precursor miRNAs
are  formed  by  MADE1  (B),  whereas 
type 3 precursor miRNAs are formed
by medium reiterated sequence (MER)
(C).  The  type  4  precursor  miRNAs 
contain  RE  sequences  (D),  and  the 
type 5 precursor miRNAs are located 
between  the  flanking  sequences  and 
REs (E). The type 6 precursor miRNAs 
are retained within the RE sequences
(F).

miRNAs into the type 2 and type 3 categories, respectively.
Type  2  precursor  miRNAs  were  distinguished  by  the 
presence of MITEs, specifically MADE1, which consists of 
two 37-bp terminal inverted repeats flanked by 6 bps of the 
internal  sequences;  390  regions  were  included  in  this 
category (20.53%) (Fig. 1B). For most type 2 miRNAs, the 
MADE1 sequences constituted more than 90% of the total 
miRNA sequences. These miRNA sequences may or may not 
have  RE-derived  sequences  on  both  terminal  sides,  and 
miRNA precursors containing RE-derived sequences were 
classified as type 1. The palindromic sequence structure of 
MADE1 has the potential to form precursor miRNAs, and 
several studies identified mature MADE1-derived miRNAs. 
In previous studies, MADE1-derived miRNAs were identi-
fied as a part of the miR-548 gene family [2]. Seed shifting 
events  in  the  miR-548  gene  family  were  detected  by 
evolutionary analysis [18]. According to our criteria, most 
genes in the miR-548 family were type 2 miRNAs, including 
seven miRNAs that were previously identified [2]. However, 
miR-548a-2  and  miR-548a-3  were  classified  as  type  1, 
because MADE1 sequences were inserted into RE sequen-
ces,  and  together,  these  RE  sequences  produce  miRNA 
sequences.

Interestingly, MADE1-derived miRNAs are inserted into 
the specific (hot-spot) sequence TA-TAT or repetitive se-
quences,  such  as  LINEs,  long  terminal  repeat  (LTR) 
elements, and other DNA elements. Some MADE1-derived 
miRNAs  harbored  hot-spot  sequences  (TA-TAT)  in  their 
miRNA gene sequences (Fig. 3). Therefore, MADE1-derived 
miRNAs  likely  formed  the  miR-548  family,  known  to  be 
primate-specific [2, 18].

have two or more RE-derived precursor miRNAs (23.79%) 
(Fig.  1A).  Only  72  previously  identified  miRNAs  (or 
15.93%) and 380 novel miRNAs were classified as type 1 
(Fig. 2). Most identified miRNAs overlapped with two REs, 
and three (miR-325, miR-649, and miR-5692b) overlapped 
with three REs. Interestingly, miR-649 consisted of three 
different RE families, including a LINE, short interspersed 
element (SINE), and DNA transposon. Those regions with 
three or more RE-derived miRNAs were more likely to be 
novel  miRNAs.  Three  novel  miRNAs  (AC079412.1, 
AL158077.1, and AL356865.1) overlapped with five REs.

Palindromic structure of RE-derived miRNAs 

Precursor miRNAs form palindromic structures. There-
fore,  TE  families  with  a  palindromic  sequence  structure, 
including  MITEs  and  MERs,  have  the  potential  to  form 
mature miRNAs [2, 10, 11]. Both of these RE families may 
be able to form miRNA sequences themselves. Therefore, 
we  assigned  MITE-derived  miRNAs  and  MER-derived

Type 3 precursor miRNAs were identified by the presence 
of  MER  sequences  (14.05%,  n  =  267)  (Fig.  1C).  Most 
MER-derived miRNA precursor sequences overlapped with 
MER sequences, because MER palindrome sequences are 
similar to miRNA precursor sequences and may be able to 
form  miRNA  sequences  themselves  [11].  Notably,  miR- 
1302-5 was classified as a type 1 precursor miRNA, because 
it combined two RE families (MER53 and AluSx). 

Patterns of RE-overlap with miRNAs

Type  4  precursor  miRNAs  harbor  one  RE  sequence 
(2.53%,  n  =  48)  (Fig.  1D).  Precursor  miRNAs  are 
approximately 60–80 nt [23]; so, it is unlikely for REs to 
occur in precursor miRNA sequences. Most type 4 miRNAs 
contained Low_complexity and Simple_repeat, because they 
tend to be relatively short. In the Simple_repeat family, a 
short  repeat  sequence  helps  to  form  miRNA  precursor 
sequences by binding regions of complementary short repeat 
sequences. For example, miR-574 contains repeat (TG)n in 
its precursor regions (Supplementary Fig. 2A), and (TG)n 
sequences contain miR-574-5p sequences (Supplementary 
Fig. 2B).

Type  5  precursor  miRNAs  were  those  formed  from 
flanking sequences and one RE (9.63%, n = 183) (Fig. 1E). 
This category had the highest ratio of identified miRNAs to 
total  miRNAs.  The  novel  miRNA  nomenclature  process 
requires cloning or expression evidence. Then, this infor-
mation is described in a manuscript accepted for publication 

[24,  25].  The  identified  miRNAs  have  a  tendency  to  be 
abundantly and ubiquitously expressed in the host. Intri-
guingly,  two  RE  families,  SINE/mammalian-wide  inter-
spersed repeat (MIR) and LINE/L2, were commonly detect-
ed in type 5 miRNA precursor sequences. These two families 
were abundant in conserved segments and were commonly 
detected in murine intergenic regions of human orthologs 
[26]. These results indicate that the L2 and MIR TE families 
were highly conserved and that these RE-derived miRNAs 
have important functional roles in the host. Taken together, 
type 5 miRNAs are relatively abundant and evolutionarily 
conserved.

By contrast, type 6 precursor miRNAs, or those formed 
from a single RE, represented 29.47% of the sample (n = 
560)  (Fig.  1F).  The  REs  contained  in  type  6  precursor 
miRNAs have the potential to produce miRNA sequences 
themselves. In type 6 miRNAs, SINE/Alu elements are the 
most common. 

Discussion

In  this  study,  we  classified  miRNAs  based  on  overlap 
patterns in identified miRNAs and novel miRNAs. In some 
cases, two or more REs were approached by “tail to tail” 
method and then making one miRNA precursor form. We 
classified  these  cases  as  type  1,  and  LINE/L1-derived 
miRNAs were abundantly discovered (Table 2). A previous 
study showed that miR-558 is derived only from MLT1C in

the LTR family [9], but we found two repeat families (LTRs 
and simple repeats) in the locus. We also determined that 
miR-619  and  miR-1302-5  were  derived  from  the  combi-
nation of two adjacent repeat families. Recently, the updated 
human genome assembly was open to the public (GRCh38/ 
hg38),  and  novel  REs  have  also  been  identified.  Our 
classification  of  RE-overlapping  miRNAs  can  provide  the 
criterion to explain the origins, evolution, and family ex-
pansion of miRNAs in another human genome assembly or 
in other species.

In type 1 precursor miRNAs, some cases overlapped with 
the same families of TEs, which can make it possible to form 
an miRNA precursor form in a “tail to tail” scheme. In a 
previous study, two LINE elements were predicted to form in 
an oppositely oriented method, like hsa-miR-28 [12], and 
LINE was also the most abundant TE family in the type 1 
miRNAs  in  our  study.  This  result  can  help  identify  new 
miRNAs  derived  from  two  or  more  REs.  MADE1s  are 
broadly  distributed  among  eukaryotes  and  function  as 
regulatory RNAs in many genomes [27]. They are expressed 
with the gene sequences in which they are inserted. This 
phenomenon  provides  active  opportunities  for  MADE1 
hairpins to function through an RNA interference enzymatic 
mechanism involved in functional gene regulation [28]. We 
identified miRNAs that consisted of more than 90% MADE1 
sequences  and  determined  the  specific  mechanisms  un-
derlying  the  formation  of  MADE1-derived  miRNA  palin-
drome sequences.

Previous reports found 103 orthologs of the miR-1302 
family  in  placental  mammals.  Moreover,  the  family  has 
undergone  multiple  duplication  events,  and  some  of  the 
duplicated  genes  have  diverged  functionally  (e.g.,  RNA- 
based  TE  defense  mechanisms),  whereas  others  have 
become  pseudogenes  or  have  been  eliminated  from  the 
genome  [10].  Therefore,  it  has  been  suggested  that  the 
miRNA gene family evolved according to a birth-and-death 
model [10, 29-31].

Alu elements and miRNAs are related. Alu elements and 
those resulting from duplication events are induced to make 
new miRNAs and, specifically, an miRNA cluster on chro-
mosome 19 (C19MC) [32]. C19MC presents primate-spe-
cific  imprinted  patterns  in  the  placenta  and  may  be  an 
example of co-evolution between Alu elements and miRNAs 
[33, 34]. Alu elements are abundant in human chromosome 
19; hence, miRNAs are also abundantly detected, including 
C19MC [32]. Most SINE elements, such as Alu, tRNAs, and 
5s-rRNAs,  are  expressed  by  polymerase  III  (pol  III),  and 
several miRNAs are expressed by pol III. Some miRNAs are 
expressed together with Alu elements by pol III [35]. These 
data  also  demonstrate  the  strong  relationship  between 
miRNA and Alu elements.

In an evolutionary aspect, primate-specific miRNAs were 
discovered  to  contain  an  Alu  element  in  their  precursor 
form. Other small REs, such as tandem duplications, occupy 
the  middle region  of miRNA  precursor forms. Therefore, 
type 4 miRNAs have abundant Simple_repeat families (Table 
2). These data demonstrate that miRNAs have been made by 
genomic evolutionary events.

In  conclusion,  we  determined  that  1,900  RE-derived 
miRNAs can be divided into six major types. Of them, 406 
identified miRNAs and 1,494 novel miRNAs were confirmed 
using the GENCODE database, and their RE patterns were 
sorted using the RepeatMasker program. The results suggest 
that  RE  sequences  were  interspersed  throughout  the 
genome  and  form  miRNA  precursor  sequences  that  play 
important  roles  in  the  host  genome.  These  regions  may 
contribute to the evolution of biological complexity.
