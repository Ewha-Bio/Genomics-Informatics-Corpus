Research into new methods for identifying highly expressed genes in anonymous genome sequences has been going on for 
more than 15 years. We presented here an alternative approach based on modified score of relative codon usage bias to 
identify highly expressed genes in crenarchaeal genomes. The proposed algorithm relies exclusively on sequence features for 
identifying the highly expressed genes. In this study, a comparative analysis of predicted highly expressed genes in five 
crenarchaeal genomes was performed using the score of Modified Relative Codon Bias Strength (MRCBS) as a numerical 
estimator of gene expression level. We found a systematic strong correlation between Codon Adaptation Index and MRCBS. 
Additionally,  MRCBS  correlated  well  with  other  expression  measures.  Our  study  indicates  that  MRCBS  can  consistently 
capture the highly expressed genes.

Introduction

The  expression  of  functional  product  of  a  gene  is  a 
foundation of modern biotechnology. Sixty-one codons to 
translate 20 amino acids and three codons to stop translation 
are employed in the genetic code. These codons are deci-
phered in the ribosome by complementary tRNAs that are 
attached with the proper amino acids [1]. The degeneracy of 
the genetic code enables same protein to be translated by 
many  alternate  nucleotide  sequences.  The  frequency  of 
different codons varies significantly between different or-
ganisms, and also between highly and lowly expressed genes 
in  the  same  organism.  There  is  a  continuing  speculation 
regarding the factors which influence these codon preferences. 
Attempts have been made to explain the codon distributions 
in protein coding genes as well as the variations in codon 
usages as mutation-selection stability among different sy-
nonymous codons in each organism [2, 3]. Researchers have 
assumed  that  codon  bias  which  tends  to  diminish  the 
diversity of isoacceptor tRNAs may decrease the metabolic 

load [4, 5]. Whatever may be the reason behind codon usage 
bias, it has gradually developed the idea that codon bias can 
have a thoughtful influence on the expression of genes. The 
equilibrium  between  mutation  and  natural  selection  on 
translational efficiency is supposed to cause of codon bias [6, 
7] and stronger relative codon usage bias (RCB) in highly 
expressed genes than lowly expressed genes is anticipated 
due  to  the  natural  selection  [8].  The  recent  technical 
advances  e.g.,  cDNA  microarray,  Serial  Analysis  of  Gene 
Expression  (SAGE),  etc.  are  large-scale,  high-throughput 
experimental methods which need material and information 
processing systems to match. Furthermore, a massive in-
vestment of time and resources put an obstacle before the 
investigators. Thus, to identify the highly expressed genes in 
vast majority of organisms, researchers were looked beyond 
the  direct  experimental  methods.  So,  predicting  gene  ex-
pression level using computational approaches rather than 
experimental is more interesting because it evades expensive 
and laborious experiment.

It is observed that highly expressed genes will preferably 
choose an optimal subset of codons identified by the most

abundant  tRNA  and  highly  expressed  genes  are  often 
depicted by strong codon usage bias [9-16]. Based on this 
hypothesis, a variety of gene expression measures like Codon 
Adaptation  Index  (CAI)  [17],  Relative  Codon  Adaptation 
(RCA) [18], Relative Codon Bias Strength (RCBS) [19-21] 
which compute codon usage bias in genes are currently in 
use,  and  hence  provide  numerical  indices  to  predict  the 
expression levels of genes. Calculation of CAI score depends 
on the knowledge of codon bias of highly expressed genes. 
However, the determination of set of highly expressed gene 
is major problem to calculate CAI and CAI is also relatively 
noisy in the short region to capture local codon bias pattern 
[22, 23]. Although the determination of set of highly expressed 
gene is not required for calculating score of RCBS, but RCBS 
has  partial  dependence  on  gene  length  (for  genes  having 
length ＜ 300 aa) [18]. Like CAI, RCA also depends on the 
knowledge of codon bias of highly expressed genes and it 
also depends on the size of the reference set because relative 
frequency  is  used  to  calculate  relative  adaptation  of  the 
codons [24, 25]. In order to overcome the problems of partial 
dependence on gene length and determination of selective 
highly expressed genes as a reference set, we proposed here 
an alternative model (Modified Relative Codon Bias Strength 
[MRCBS]) to predict the expression levels of genes from 
their codon compositions. It has no length dependence on 
the gene size and uses codon usage of ribosomal protein 
(RP) genes which are believed to be highly expressed genes 
[11, 12] as a reference set for our calculation. To measure the 
predictive performance of the methodology, we compared 
the performances of several commonly used measures in this 
work. 

Here,  we  investigated  the  gene  expression  and  the 
variation in patterns of synonymous codon usage across the 
crenarchaeal  genomes.  Crenarchaeota  is  one  of  the  four 
phyla of Archaea and includes both cold-dwelling and hyper-
thermophilic prokaryotes. The cold-dwelling Crenarchaeota 
have been recognized only as community samples of 16S 
ribosomal RNA from the marine environments. The hyper-
thermophilic species of Crenarchaeota, some of which have 
the ability to grow at up to 113oC, have been isolated from 
geothermally  heated  soils,  waters  containing  elemental 
sulfur and sulfides, or hydrothermal vents [26]. At higher 
temperatures, bioleaching rates of thermophilic organisms 
surpass their low temperature microbial counterparts and 
subsequently significant research interest grows to use of 
these organisms for biomining applications [27]. Cold-dwelling 
organisms  survives  extremely  low  temperature  and  uses 
antifreeze proteins (AFP) for their development and existence 
in subzero environments. AFPs can be applied in the field of 
aquaculture, agriculture, cryopreservation, cryosurgery, and 
food storage [28, 29]. Metabolically, Crenarchaeota which 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  1,  2017

are quite diverse and varying from chemoorganotrophs to 
chemolithoautotrophs, include anaerobes, facultative anae-
robes or aerobes, and many of them employ sulfur in some 
way  for  energy  metabolism  [30].  Numerous  species  use 
carbon  dioxide  as  only  carbon  source  to  produce  organic 
matter,  and  procure  energy  by  the  oxidation  of  inorganic 
substances like sulfur and hydrogen, and reduction of sulfur 
or nitrate. Some species develop on organic substrates by 
aerobic  or  anaerobic  respiration  or  by  fermentation.  The 
most  remarkable  property  of  the  Crenarchaeota  is  their 
survival in the environment involving extremes of acidity 
and temperature.

These  uncommon  features  of  Crenarchaeota  have 
fascinated the research interest of evolutionary biologists 
and biotechnology companies. The environment when first 
life emerged on the early Earth can be thought similar to the 
extreme  conditions  of  the  environment  under  which 
Crenarchaeota reside currently. This information proposes 
that first forms of life on earth may be similar to Crenar-
chaeota. Also, extreme resistance to heat and acid of cellular 
enzymes  make  Crenarchaeota  very  appealing  to  use  in 
industry and research. Thus gene expression of crenarchaeal 
genomes  is  expected  to  make  important  contributions  in 
several areas. 

Methods

The whole genomes along with gene annotations were 
retrieved  from  NCBI  GenBank.  All  sequences  marked  as 
coding sequences were considered, including those annotated 
as  hypothetical  and  those  predicted  by  computational 
methods only. In this study, we measured the expression 
pattern  and  codon  usage  of  five  crenarchaeal  genomes 
namely,  Aeropyrumpernix  K1  (GenBank  accession  No. 
NC_000854),  Hyperthermus  butylicus  DSM  5456  (GenBank 
accession  No.  NC_008818),  Pyrobaculum  aerophilum  IM2 
(GenBank accession No. NC_003364), Sulfolobus solfataricus 
P2  (GenBank  accession  No.  NC_002754),  and  Sulfolobus 
tokodaii  7  (GenBank  accession  No.  NC_003106).  In  the 
following sections, we have briefly described the different 
expression  level  predictors  CAI,  RCBS,  RCA,  GC3,  and 
Impact Codon and developed an alternative approach using 
the score of MRCBS.

Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) 

The CAI [17] measures the deviation of a given protein 
coding  gene  sequence  with  respect  to  a  reference  set  of 
genes.  It  defines  translationally  optimal  codons  as  those 
appear frequently in highly expressed genes. The CAI model 
assigns a parameter, termed ‘relative adaptiveness’ to each of 
the 61 codons (stop codons excluded). Relative adaptiveness

(wi)  is  obtained  by  normalizing  the  frequency  of  each 
synonymous codons by the frequency of the most frequent 
codon. So, relative adaptiveness for most frequent codon is 1 
and other codon is less than 1. The CAI of a gene is simply the 
geometric average of the relative adaptiveness of all codons 
in a gene sequence,

where fi is the frequency of codon i, and faa,max is the maximum 
frequency of the codon most often used for encoding amino 
acid aa in a set of highly expressed genes of the particular 
genome. N is the number of codons in the gene. CAI ranges 
from 0 to 1. The higher are the CAI values, the genes are 
more likely to be highly expressed.

Relative Codon Bias Strength (RCBS)

Relative Codon Adaptation (RCA)

Fox and Erill [18] proposed RCA that measures codon 
bias of a gene based on a set of highly expressed genes. RCA 
makes use of a given reference set to compute observed and 
expected  codon  frequencies.  Relative  adaptation  for 
individual codon xyz is defined as

quency of base m at codon position i in the same reference set

GC3

Highly expressed gene uses a set of optimal codons. These 
codons are biased to pyrimidines (i.e., C and T) ending at the 
third position. Shields [31] found that GC contents at silent 
sites were often correlated with gene expression. The base 
composition at silent sites measures the GC content at the 
third position of synonymous codons (GC3s) and can be used 
as  an  index  of  codon  bias.  It  is  the  frequency  of  G  or  C 
nucleotides present at the third position of codons except 
non-degenerate codons (i.e., Met, Trp, and stop codons)

bias  and  it  seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  RCB  in  the 
highly  expressed  genes  is  strongly  influenced  by  the 
presence of impact codons.

Modified Relative Codon Bias Strength (MRCBS) 

The codon composition of genes fundamentally affects the 
protein  translation.  Our  approach  in  estimating  gene  ex-
pression level is related to codon usage bias of a gene with 
respect to biased nucleotide composition at the three codon 
sites. Let fxyz be the observed normalized codon frequency for 
the codon triplet (x,y,z) in a particular reference set of gene 
and  fn(m)  is the relative  observed  frequency  of base m  at 
codon position n in the same reference set. Then, the RCB of 
a codon triplet (x,y,z) is defined as the ratio of observed 
frequency of a codon to the expected frequency under the 
hypothesis  of  random  codon  usage  where  the  base 
compositions are biased at three sites as that in the reference 
set under study.

Thus the expression measure of MRCBS [24, 25] of a gene 

is defined as

parameterization  set.  We  calculated  the  CAI  parameters 
taking  parameterization  set  as  reference  set.  With  the 
parameters in hand, CAI values for all the genes in the data 
set were computed. In order to evaluate how well the MRCBS 
predicts  expression  level,  we  measured  the  correlation 
between CAI values of the data set and evaluation set as 
merit of the method. We iterated the procedure by changing 
the  expression  level  threshold  T  and  repeating  the  sub-
sequent steps until we arrived at an optimal merit of the 
method. Thus, we obtained the optimal threshold value of 
MRCBS of the whole genome expression data. 

In this work, the expression level predictors CAI, RCA, 
and MRCBS have been computed by comparing its codon 
usage bias with the profile of universally functional genes, 
such as the RP genes, which are commonly referred as a 
reference set. The PHE are then characterized on the basis of 
the  strength  of  the  codon  usage  bias  derived  from  the 
algorithms as described above and a gene is identified as PHE 
gene provided its MRCBS exceeds threshold value. To this 
end, we computed Pearson r correlation coefficients between 
different codon usage bias indices.

RCBSaa, max is the maximum RCBS of codon encoding same 
amino acid aa in the same reference set, and N is the length 
in codons of the query sequence. MRCBSxyz is independent of 
the size of the reference set as it is the ratio of the RCBS of 
the codon xyz to the maximum of RCBS of codon encoding 
same amino acid. The value of MRCBS lies between 0 and 1. 
In this study, the criteria MRCBS ＞ T (threshold score) 
was taken as a benchmark for identifying the highly expressed 
genes and methodology used to calculate threshold score as 
described in Sahoo and Das [25]. Due to evolving codon 
assignments as well as codon usage patterns as the adaptive 
response of genomes, threshold score for identifying highly 
expressed genes  varies from genome to genome. For cal-
culating threshold score (T), we defined a parameterization 
set  to  evaluate  how  well  CAI  value  correlates  actual  ex-
pression level predicted by MRCBS. First, we calculated the 
CAI of the all genes by taking all RP (＞ 80 aa) genes as 
predicted highly expressed genes (PHE) genes and called 
this as an evaluation set. Then taking an arbitrary threshold 
score T of MRCBS we differentiated highly expressed genes 
from  lowly  expressed  genes.  The  highly  expressed  genes 
with  expression  level  (MRCBS)  greater  than  T  define 

We analyzed PHE genes in crenarchaeal genomes with 
respect to MRCBS. We calculated the expression pattern and 
codon  usage  in  Aeropyrumpernix  K1,  Hyperthermus  butylicus 
DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus 
P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7. Threshold scores used to classify 
highly expressed genes in our approach in Aeropyrumpernix 
K1, Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum 
IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 were 
turned out to be 0.75, 0.68, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.83, respectively. 
GC  content  of  Aeropyrumpernix  K1,  Hyperthermus  butylicus 
DSM 5456, Pyrobaculum aerophilum IM2, Sulfolobus solfataricus 
P2, and Sulfolobus tokodaii 7 are 56.31%, 53.74%, 51.36%, 
35.79%,  and  32.79%,  respectively.  This  variation  of  GC 
content may be regarded as the main reason of codon usage 
variances between different species of Crenarchaeota. Table 
1 displays the statistics of PHE genes, GC content and the 
maximum  value  of  MRCBS  for  each  of  the  crenarchaeal 
genomes used in the study. It was observed that percentage 
of PHE genes in Escherichia coli was 9% to 10% [9,15] and 
percentage  of  PHE  genes  in  Synechocystis  was  about  10% 
[11], whereas the percentage of PHE genes in crenarchaeal 
genomes varied from 11.53% to 33.38% and were independent 
of  GC  content  or  optimal  growth  temperature  of  these 
unicellular  organisms.  It  indicates  that  the  percentage  of 
PHE genes in Crenarchaeota is higher than in bacteria. The 
correlation between growth temperature and genomic GC 
content has not established by most of the studies [33, 34]

and  in  general,  the  variation  in  GC  content  is  mostly 
elucidated by subtle but persistent mutation biases [35, 36]. 
It is familiar that highly expressed genes show stronger 
codon usage bias than the genes expressed at lower levels. In 
agreement with previous other reports [9-11], we observed 
that PHE genes of crenarchaeal species included RP genes, 
translational/transcription genes, chaperon or degradation 
genes  and  many  stress  and  energy  metabolism  genes. 
However,  all  RP  genes  of  crenarchaeal  genomes  do  not 
incorporate the PHE gene class. The percentage of RP genes 
in crenarchaeal genomes varies from 47% to 87.88% whereas 
almost all RP genes in E. coli and yeast fall in PHE class of 
genes [19, 20]. It is remarkable that 99.21% RP genes in 
yeast  genome  were  PHE  [20].  However,  an  average  of 
65.56% RP genes in crenarchaeal genomes were found to be 
PHE,  indicating  that  many  RP  genes  of  crenarchaeal 
genomes  were  of  reduced  predicted  expression  level  in 
contrast to E. coli and yeast. Crenarchaeota generally live in 
extreme environmental conditions that are likely to affect 
the expression level of the respective gene responsible for its 
habitat, energy sources and lifestyle. The highest predicted 
expression  levels  of  top  10  genes  for  five  crenarchaeal 
genomes are shown in Table 2. It is worth noticing that these 
genes  are  separated  into  different  functional  categories. 
Annotation  of  these  PHE  genes  was  done  by  Secondary 
(JCVI)  Annotation  (http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/ 
GenomePage.cgi).

As it can be seen from the Table 2, the PHE genes are 
variably  represented  among  crenarchaeal  genomes.  We 
observed that genes belonging to the class of translation, 
ribosomal  structure  and  biogenesis  were  generally  highly 
expressed. In the top 10 highly expressed genes among five 
crenarchaeal genomes, 28 RP genes (56%) were found to be 
highly expressed (shown in Table 2). The RNA polymerase 
subunits  RpoA1,  RpoA2,  RpoB,  RpoE1,  RpoE2,  RpoH, 
RpoK,  RpoL,  and  RPoN  as  with  bacterial  genomes  were 
found  to  be  predominantly  PHE  in  many  crenarchaeal 
genomes.  Several  noticeable  genes,  e.g.,  Ths,  PCNA,  P0, 
Cdc48, and Pfd which are absent from bacterial genomes, 
but exist in eukaryotes, were found to be highly expressed in 

many  crenarchaeal  genomes.  A  number  of  genes  which 
include  ribonucleotide  reductase,  the  DNA  polymerase 
sliding clamp and members of the FAD synthetase family, 
exhibit  cell  cycle-dependent  expression  in  crenarchaeal 
genomes. It should be noticed that these genes are usually 
existed by multiple copies in the genome. Among other PHE 
genes,  Rieske  iron-sulfur  protein  and  ferredoxin  have 
important functions in these organisms. Besides, we identified 
a number of PHE genes which play important role in signal 
transduction mechanism, amino acid transport and meta-
bolism, secondary metabolites biosynthesis and catabolism, 
cell  wall/membrane/envelop  biogenesis,  inorganic  ion 
transport and metabolism, coenzyme transport and meta-
bolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, intercellular 
trafficking, and energy production and conversion.

However, a portion of genes categorized as hypothetical 
genes  may  be  obtained  among  the  PHE  genes  in  most 
crenarchaeal genomes. Table 2 displays the general statistics 
of hypothetical or poorly characterized PHE genes found in 
several crenarchaeal genomes. Goodacre et al. [37] showed 
that 238 out of 355 essential proteins in 16 model bacterial 
species comprised proteins in domains of unknown function 
(DUFs),  and  most  of  them  characterized  single-domain 
proteins which clearly established the biological importance 
of  DUFs.  It  suggests  that  experimental  research  should 
emphasis on conserved and essential DUFs for functional 
analysis.  So,  PHE  hypothetical  genes  may  be  interesting 
candidates for experimental categorizations to find additional 
key features of the crenarchaeal cell cycle. The temporal and 
spatial grouping of these genes for chromosome replication, 
genome  segregation,  and  cell  division  processes  are  little 
categorized in Crenarchaeota than in bacteria and eukaryotes. 
A comprehensive study of these putative/hypothetical PHE 
genes should produce a more comprehensive image of the 
replication and division machineries, and regulatory features 
of the cell cycle.

sition of the genome governed by codon usage pattern is 
hypothesized to commence selective forces acting on highly 
expressed  genes  to  expedite  translation  efficiency.  There 
were no impact codons coding Met, Val, Gln, and Asn in 
Hyperthermus butylicus DSM 5456 and Pyrobaculum aerophilum 
IM2. 

It was observed that the set of preferred (impact) codons 
in crenarchaeal genomes coding for Leu, Tyr, Lys, Glu, Arg, 
and Trp were ctt and ctc, tat and tac, aag, gag, aga and agg, 
and tgg, respectively. For mesophiles, atg and tcg were the 
preferential codons coding for Met and Ser while aag is the 
preferential codon coding for Lys in (hyper)thermophiles. It 
is  important  to  notice  that  the  distinguished  preferred 
(impact) codons coding Arg and Ile separate mesophiles (cgc 
and atc) from (hyper)thermophiles (aga/agg and ata). There 
were  no  impact  codons  coding  for  Asp  and  Cys  in  cre-
narchaeal genomes. We observed that all favored (impact) 
codons were not GC rich in crenarchaeal genomes. So, GC3 
could not accurately measure the bias in codon usage. It is 
generally  acknowledged  that  bias  in  synonymous  codon 
usage is influenced by the cellular amount of isoacceptor 
tRNA genes. In this study, we have noticed that all tRNA 
genes  corresponding  to  impact  codons  have  not  been 
identified by tRNAscanSE and many tRNAs decode two or 
more  codons,  which  indicates  that  impact  codons  may 
possibly influence translational efficiency. As the optimal set 
of favored codons is used in highly expressed genes, this 
observation could have significant role in improvement of 
tRNA finding algorithm.

Correlations among different codon bias indices

In this study, we compared the performances of several 
commonly used measures underlying gene expression. The 
outlines  of  gene  expression  of  the  crenarchaeal  genomes 
were governed by calculating CAI, RCA, RCBS, and MRCBS. 
Currently,  CAI  has  become  widely  accepted  method  for

and  different  measures  of  expression  are  plotted  for  different  or-
ganisms.  MRCBS,  Modified  Relative  Codon  Bias  Strength;  RCA,

subset of potential codons is used (Table 3). There were no 
impact codons coding His in the presently studied crenarchaeal 
genomes. The impact codons in crenarchaeal genomes was 
found to be mostly used in coding Phe, Leu, Tyr, Glu, Ser, Ala, 
Trp, Pro, Arg, and Gly. Besides His, no impact codons coding 
Asp and Cys were found in crenarchaeal genomes. The data 
set investigated here revealed a strong bias of the usage of 
favored codons in highly expressed genes but lowly expressed 
gene displayed small amount of synonymous codon usage 
bias.  It  is  hypothesized  that  codon  translated  using  an 
abundant  tRNA  expedite  translation  efficiency  and  this 
translation selection gives birth of codon usage bias. Fre-
quencies of different codons were noticed to differ between 
genes in the same genome and between genomes. Using 61 
codons and three non-sense codons, almost all organisms 
have prepared the same codon assignments for each amino 
acid, but the favored use of individual codons differs to a 
great extent among genes. The overall nucleotide compo-

theoretically recognizing highly expressed genes from codon 
usage in various organisms. The CAI scores were calculated 
by taking all RP (＞80aa) genes as PHE genes which are 
commonly referred as reference set. RCA frequencies were 
computed using the identical reference set as used in the 
calculation of CAI. The results (Fig. 1) indicate that there is 
a  strong  correlation  between  RCA  and  CAI  while  the 
correlation of RCBS with CAI is significantly smaller. The 
novel method of quantitatively calculating gene expressivity 
by  MRCBS  was  then  compared  with  CAI  and  correlation 
between  them  was  found  to  be  surprisingly  good.  These 
correlation coefficients can be used to express the strength of 
the existing prediction methods. It can be seen that MRCBS 
consistently  yields  better  correlation  than  other.  We  also 
observed  a  clear  correlation  between  CAI  and  GC3,  but 
surprisingly, there was strong negative correlation between 
GC3 and CAI in some species which cannot be explained.

In order to validate our results with the experimental data 
[38],  we  collected  proteomics  and  microarray  data  and 
compared  the  proteomic  and  microarray  results  with  our 
predicted  values  of  expression  level.  Fig.  2  plotted  the 
relative abundances of mRNA and protein levels of the genes 
of S. solfataricus grown on yeast extract and tryptone (YT) 
compared  to  glucose  (G)  against  CAI,  RCBS,  RCA,  and 
MRCBS. The correlation coefficient between transcriptomics 
and MRCBS was found to be –0.31 whereas that with CAI, 
RCA, and RCBS were 0.04, –0.17, and –0.26, respectively and 
correlation coefficient between proteomics and MRCBS was 
–0.44 whereas that with CAI, RCA, and RCBS were –0.18, 
–0.34, and 0.05, respectively. Even though these results are 
not  good,  but  the  results  recommend  that  a  quantitative 
estimate of expression level by MRCBS accomplishes better 
performance than other existing computational methods.

We demonstrated that MRCBS could be a useful tool for 

predicting highly expressed genes. The basic concept validating 
our  method  was  to  compare  the  result  of  different  gene 
expression  measures  with  a  universal  measure,  the  CAI 
values of the genes. This methodology is accepted as CAI is 
widely assumed to be universal method and highly correlated 
with different measures of codon bias used in the literature 
[13]. Predicting gene expression levels in different crenarchaeal 
genomes using MRCBS is to make this index a better choice 
of measuring codon bias than others. CAI hypothesized that 
background nucleotide composition was uniform and this 
hypothesis was not always true. RCA uses codon bias of 
highly expressed genes of a given reference set like other 
reference set based measures (e.g., CAI) but the difference 
between  RCA  and  CAI  is  that  RCA  uses  the  patterns  of 
mutational bias observed in the given reference set. For any 
given reference set, MRCBS first computes the codon bias as 
the  deviation  of  the  observed  codon  frequency  from  the 
expected  codon  frequency  based  on  its  positional  base 
frequencies and ratio between the RCB of that codon and the 
largest RCB among its synonymous codons is defined as the 
relative  adaptiveness  of  that  codon.  Thus,  MRCBS  takes 
explicitly into account the mutational bias in the calculation 
of  codon  bias  and  will  be  more  powerful  and  precise 
estimator of gene expression.

To  measure  the  predictive  performance  of  MRCBS,  we 
compared  the  performances  of  several  commonly  used 
measures  in  different  crenarchaeal  genomes.  Our  results 
demonstrated that MRCBS well correlated with CAI than 
other  codon  bias  measures  in  all  crenarchaeal  genomes. 
Since experimental methods are expensive and laborious, 
results of gene expression by computational methods might 
be used as reference data for validating and better under-
standing experimental data. For example, findings of PHE 
gene with low level expression from proteomic or microarray

data could suggest the probable contribution of degradation 
in regulating expression levels of that gene [8]. Although 
most of the PHE genes are essential genes responsible for the 
habitat, energy sources and life style of different species of 
Crenarchaeota, the results are also predicted a number of 
genes in DUF as PHE genes. Combined study of computational 
and experimental approach of these genes will enrich our 
knowledge of metabolism.
