RNA  is  a  polymeric  molecule  implicated  in  various  biological  processes,  such  as  the  coding,  decoding,  regulation,  and 
expression  of  genes.  Numerous  studies  have  examined  RNA  features  using  whole  transcriptome  sequencing  (RNA-seq) 
approaches.  RNA-seq  is  a  powerful  technique  for  characterizing  and  quantifying  the  transcriptome  and  accelerates  the 
development  of  bioinformatics  software.  In  this  review,  we  introduce  routine  RNA-seq  workflow  together  with  related 
software, focusing particularly on transcriptome reconstruction and expression quantification.

Keywords: bioinformatics tools, gene expression, high-throughput RNA sequencing, transcript 

Introduction

The transcriptome is the entire set of RNA transcripts in 
a  given  cell  for a  specific developmental  stage  or physio-
logical condition [1]. Understanding the transcriptome is 
necessary  for  interpreting  the  functional  elements  of  the 
genome  as  well  as  for  understanding  the  underlying 
mechanisms of development and disease. Microarray tech-
nologies  have  been  used  for  high-throughput  large-scale 
RNA-level  studies,  such  as  to  identify  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes  between  developmental  stages  or  between 
healthy  and  diseased  groups  [2].  However,  its  hybridi-
zation-based nature limits the ability to catalog and quantify 
RNA  molecules  expressed  under  various  conditions. 
Advances in massive parallel DNA sequencing technologies 
have  enabled  transcriptome  sequencing  (RNA-seq)  by 
sequencing  of  cDNA.  RNA-seq  has  rapidly  replaced 
microarray technology because of its better resolution and 
higher reproducibility; this method can be used to extend 
our knowledge of alternative splicing events [3], novel genes 
and transcripts [4], and fusion transcripts [5].

One  concern  regarding  the  application  of  RNA-seq  is 
abundance estimation at the gene-level and transcript-level 
differential  expression  under  distinct  conditions.  Routine 
RNA-seq workflow may consist of the following five steps as 

shown  in  Fig.  1:  (1)  preprocessing  of  raw  data,  (2)  read 
alignment, (3) transcriptome reconstruction, (4) expression 
quantification, and (5) differential expression analysis. As an 
initial  step,  RNA-seq  data  may  be  subjected  to  quality 
control (QC) of the raw data before data analysis. Similar to 
whole genome or exome sequencing, read alignment can be 
performed  to  map  the  reads  to  the  reference  genome  or 
transcriptome.  Clinical  samples  including  formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded specimen and cancer tissue biopsies are 
often  degraded  or  exist  in  limited  amount  [6].  Thus 
additional QC procedure can be performed to evaluate the 
performance  of  the  RNA-seq  experiment  itself  after  read 
alignment. Next, transcriptome reconstruction is carried out 
to identify all transcripts expressed in a specimen based on 
read  mapping  data.  If  there  is  no  available  reference 
sequence, this procedure can be conducted directly using a de 
novo assembly approach. Once all transcripts are identified, 
their abundances can be estimated using read mapping data. 
Finally, differential expression analysis is conducted using 
currently available programs. In this review, we discuss the 
RNA-seq workflow and its related bioinformatics tools in 
each step (Table 1), focusing on transcriptome reconstruc-
tion and abundance quantification.

Fig.  1.  Typical  workflow  for  RNA  sequencing  (RNA-seq)  data 
analysis.  This  workflow  shows  an  example  for  expression  quanti-
fication and differential expression analysis at gene and/or transcript
level  using  RNA-seq,  which  is  typically  consisted  of  five  steps  as 
following: preprocessing, read alignment, transcriptome reconstruc-
tion, expression quantification and differential expression analysis.
For  each  step,  currently  available  programs  are  written  in  Table  1.
QC,  quality  control.

Preprocessing of Raw Data

Similarly to whole genome or exome sequencing, RNA- 
seq data is formatted in FASTQ (sequence and base quality). 
Numerous erroneous sequence variants can be introduced 
during  the  library  preparation,  sequencing,  and  imaging 
steps [7], which should be identified and filtered out in the 
data analysis step. Thus, QC of raw data should be performed 
as the initial step of routine RNA-seq workflow. Tools such 
as FastQC [8] and HTQC [9] can be applied in this step to 
assess the quality of raw data, enabling assessment of the 
overall and per-base quality for each read (i.e., read 1 and 2 
in case of paired-end sequencing) in each sample. Depending 
on the RNA-seq library construction strategy, some form of 
read  trimming  may  be  advisable  prior  to  aligning  the 
RNA-seq  data.  Two  common  trimming  strategies  include 
“adapter  trimming”  and  “quality  trimming.”  Adapter 
trimming involves removal of the adapter sequence by mas-
king  specific  sequences  used  during  library  construction. 
Quality trimming generally removes the ends of reads where 
base  quality  scores  have  decreased  to  a  level  such  that 
sequence errors and the resulting mismatches prevent reads 

from aligning. The adapter trimming step is typically not 
necessary, as most recent sequencers provide raw data in 
which the adapters are already trimmed. In contrast, quality 
trimming may be an essential step depending on the analysis 
strategy used. The FASTX-Toolkit [10] and FLEXBAR [11] 
are useful for this purpose.

Read Alignment

There  are  two  strategies  in  which  a  genome  or  trans-
criptome is used as a reference for the read alignment step 
[12]. The transcriptome comprises all transcripts in a given 
specimen  and  in  which  splicing  has  been  conducted  by 
including  the  exons  and  excluding  the  introns.  If  a 
transcriptome is used as a reference, unspliced aligners that 
do not allow large gaps may be the proper choice for accurate 
read mapping. Stampy, Mapping and Assembly with Quality 
(MAQ)  [13],  Burrow-Wheeler  Aligner  (BWA)  [14],  and 
Bowtie  [15]  can  be  used  in  this  case.  This  alignment  is 
limited to the identification of known exons and junctions 
because it does not identify splicing events involving novel 
exons. However, if the genome is used as a reference, spliced 
aligners that allow a wide range of gaps should be employed 
because reads aligned at exon-exon junctions will be split 
into two fragments. This approach may increase the pro-
bability  of  identifying  novel  transcripts  generated  by 
alternative  splicing.  Various  spliced  aligners  have  been 
developed, including TopHat [16], MapSplice [17], STAR 
[18], and GSNAP [19].

RNA-Seq Specific QC

Several intrinsic biases and limitations including nucle-
otide  composition  bias,  GC  bias  and  polymerase  chain 
reaction bias can be introduced to RNA-seq data of clinical 
samples with low quality or quantity. To evaluate the biases 
from  RNA-seq  data, several metrics  may  be  examined  as 
following: percentage of exonic or rRNA reads, accuracy and 
biases in gene expression measurements, GC bias, evenness 
of coverage, 5′-to-3′ coverage bias, and coverage of 5′ and 3′ 
ends  [6].  Some  programs  including  RNA-SeQC  [20], 
RSeQC [21], and Qualimap 2 [22] are currently available for 
the purposes, which take typically BAM file as input. 

RNA-SeQC [20] provides three types of QC metrics based 
on  read  count  (total,  unique  and  duplicate  reads,  rRNA 
content, strand specificity, etc.), coverage (mean coverage, 
5′/3′  coverage,  GC  bias,  etc.),  and  expression  correlation 
(reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM]–based 
estimation of expression levels and correlation matrix by all 
pairwise  comparison).  The  software  also  provides  multi- 
sample evaluation regarding library construction protocols,

input materials and other experimental parameters.

RSeQC  [21]  is  a  Python-based  package  program  that 
provides  several  metrics  containing  sequence  quality,  GC 
bias, polymerase chain reaction bias, nucleotide composition 
bias,  sequencing  depth,  strand  specificity,  coverage  uni-
formity, and read distribution over the genome structure. Of 
the  metrics,  sequencing  depth  is  importance,  because  it 
allows users to determine if current RNA-seq data is suitable 
for  such  application  including  expression  profiling,  alter-
native  splicing  analysis,  novel  isoform  identification,  and 
transcriptome  reconstruction  by  checking  whether  the 
sequencing depth is saturated or not. 

Qualimap 2 [22] is consisted of four analysis modes: BAM 
QC, Counts QC, RNA-seq QC, and Multi-sample BAM QC. 
Compared  to  previous  release,  this  version  focuses  on 
multi-sample  QC  for  high-throughput  sequencing  data. 
Multi-sample  BAM  QC  mode  allows  combined  QC  for 
multiple alignment files, which takes the metrics from the 
single-sample BAM QC mode as input. RNA-seq QC mode is 
added  to  compute  the  metrics  specific  to  RNA-seq  data, 
which contains per-transcript coverage, junction sequence 
distribution, genomic localization of reads, 5′-3′ bias and 
consistency of the library protocol. Counts QC mode enables 
to estimate the saturation of sequencing depth, read count 
densities, correlation of samples and distribution of counts 
among  classes  of  selected  features  along  with  gene  ex-
pression estimation based on NOIseq [23].

Transcriptome Reconstruction

Transcriptome reconstruction is the identification of all 
transcripts expressed in a specimen. There are two strategies 
used  for  transcriptome  reconstruction,  including  the 
reference-guided  approach  and  the  reference-independent 
approach. First, the reference-guided approach consists of 
two  sequential  steps:  (1)  alignment  of  raw  reads  to  the 
reference  as  described  in  the  previous  section  and  (2) 
assembly of overlapping reads for reconstructing transcripts. 
This approach is advantageous when reference annotation 
information is well-known, such as in human and mouse, 
which  is  employed  in  Cufflinks  [24],  Scripture  [25],  and 
StringTie [26]. Second, the reference-independent approach 
uses  a  de  novo  assembly  algorithm  to  directly  build  con-
sensus  transcripts  from  short  reads  without  reference, 
which is useful when there is no known reference genome or 
transcriptome.  Trinity  [27],  Oases  [28],  and  transABySS 
[29] may be used for this purpose.

Two publications have described RNA-seq protocols: one 
is de novo transcriptome reconstruction without reference 
using the Trinity platform [30] and the other is differential 
expression  analysis  of  a  gene  and  transcript  using  a 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

combination of TopHat and Cufflinks [31]. The latter pro-
tocol also includes a transcriptome reconstruction procedure 
(using  Cufflinks)  from  read  mapping  data  to  a  reference 
genome (using TopHat). These protocols are good examples 
of  different  strategies  that  can  be  used  for  transcriptome 
reconstruction  according  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  a 
reference sequence.

Expression Quantification

Numerous methods have been developed for expression 
quantification  using  RNA-seq  data.  The  methods  are 
grouped into two according to the target levels: gene- and 
isoform-level quantification. Alternative expression analysis 
by sequencing (ALEXA-seq) [32], enhanced read analysis of 
gene  expression  (ERANGE)  [33],  and  normalization  by 
expected uniquely mappable area (NEUMA) [34] support 
gene-level  quantification.  Isoform-level  quantification 
methods  are  divided  into  three  groups  according  to  the 
reference type and requirement of alignment results. The 
first group (e.g., RSEM [35]) requires the alignment result of 
reads using the transcriptome as a reference. The second 
group (e.g., Cufflinks [24] and StringTie [26]) also requires 
alignment results of reads using whole genome sequences as 
a reference rather than the transcriptome. The last group 
(e.g.,  Sailfish  [36])  uses  an  alignment-free  method.  We 
discuss each isoform-level quantification method in detail in 
the following sections.

RSEM

RSEM 

is  software  that  quantifies  transcript-level 
abundance from RNA-seq data. RSEM is operated in two 
steps: (1) generation and preprocessing of a set of reference 
transcript  sequences  and  (2)  alignment  of  reads  to  the 
reference  transcripts  followed  by  estimation  of  transcript 
abundances  and  their  credibility  intervals.  A  FASTA 
formatted file of transcript sequences is used to generate the 
reference transcripts, which can be obtained from a reference 
genome database, a de novo transcriptome assembler, or an 
Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) database. Alternatively, a 
gene  annotation  file  in  GTF  format  and  the  full  genome 
sequence in FASTA format may be supplied. RSEM uses the 
Bowtie alignment program [15]. A user-provided aligner can 
be  used  for  mapping  RNA-seq  reads  using  reference 
transcripts.  RSEM  provides  gene-level  and  isoform-level 
estimates as the primary output by computing maximum 
likelihood abundance estimates based on the Expectation- 
Maximization (EM) algorithm after read mapping. Abundance 
estimates are given in terms of two measures: an estimate of 
the  number  of  fragments  and  the  estimated  fraction  of 

www.genominfo.org

transcripts comprising a given isoform or gene. The latter 
−6 to obtain a measure of 
estimates can be multiplied by 10
transcripts  per  million  (TPM).  RSEM  also  supports  the 
visualization of alignment and read depth using a genome 
browser  such  as  the  University  of  California  Santa  Cruz 
(UCSC) Genome Browser.

Cufflinks

The Tuxedo package is the most widely used software for 
transcript assembly and quantification using RNA-seq and 
consists of a number of different programs, including TopHat, 
Cufflinks, and Cuffdiff [31]. In the initial step, TopHat is 
employed for mapping raw RNA-seq reads to a reference 

Table  1.  Selected  list  of  RNA-seq  analysis  programs

genome, where some reads can be spliced when they were 
aligned  on  the  exon-exon  junctions  of  transcripts.  These 
mapped  reads  are  provided  as  input  to  Cufflinks  for 
transcript assembly and abundance estimation. Transcript 
assembly is achieved by building an overlap graph from the 
mapped reads followed by computing minimal path cover in 
the  overlap  graph,  generating  a  minimum  number  of 
transcripts  that  will  explain  all  reads  in  the  graph. 
Abundance  estimation  is  performed  by  estimating  the 
maximum 
likelihood  abundance  based  on  transcript 
coverage and compatibility together with the use of fragment 
length distribution. Abundances are reported in fragments 
per  kilobase  per  million  mapped  fragments  (FPKM)  for 
paired-end and RPKM for a single-end. Cuffdiff, a part of the

genes  and  transcripts  that  are  differentially  expressed. 
CummeRbund  can  produce  figures  and  plots  from  the 
Cuffdiff outputs.

StringTie

StringTie  is  software  used  for  transcriptome  recon-
struction and abundance estimation. Similarly to other tools, 
including Cufflinks, spliced aligners such as TopHat2 [37] or 
GSNAP [19] are used to directly align RNA-seq reads or 
subsequent alignment after generating pre-assembled contigs 
from the reads using a de novo assembler such as MaSurCa 
[38].  StringTie  can  perform  transcriptome  reconstruction 
and abundance estimation simultaneously by building a flow 
network for the path of the heaviest coverage and computing 
the maximum flow to estimate abundance. StringTie reports 
estimated abundance in FPKM for paired-end and RPKM for 
single-end.

Sailfish

Sailfish  is  unique  software  adopting  an  alignment-free 
approach for isoform quantification. An index is built from a 
set of reference transcripts and a specific choice of k-mer 
length,  which  consists  of  data  structures  that  maps  each 
k-mer  in  the  reference  transcripts  to  a  unique  integer 
identifier, enabling to count k-mers in a set of reads and to 
resolve their origin in the set of transcripts. Until the set of 
reference transcripts or the k-mer length is changed, it is not 
necessary to rebuild the index. Sailfish computes an estimate 
of the relative abundance of each transcript in the reference 
by employing an EM algorithm similar to that used in RSEM. 
Because Sailfish avoids read alignment entirely, the running 
time for quantification is much lower than for other existing 
methods.  Sailfish  reports  terms  of  abundance  measures, 
including (1) RPKM, (2) k-mers per kilobase per million 
mapped k-mers (KPKM), and (3) TPM.

We described four programs, RSEM, Cufflinks, StringTie, 
and  Sailfish  in  detail.  In  addition  to  the  use  of  specific 
algorithm, a major difference between these programs may 
be the reference type used. A set of transcript sequences is 
used as a reference in RSEM and Sailfish, indicating that the 
programs may be suitable for estimating the abundance of 
known transcripts. In contrast, a reference genome is em-
ployed  in  Cufflinks  and  StringTie,  making  it  possible  to 
present the estimated abundance of novel transcripts as well 
as already known transcripts, as spliced read mapping data 
can  reveal  known  and  novel  splice  junction  information 
simultaneously.

Differential Expression using RNA-seq

For differential expression analysis, a number of software 
packages  and  pipelines  have  been  developed  including 
edgeR  [39],  DESeq  [40],  NOIseq  [23],  SAMseq  [41], 
Cuffdiff [24], and EBSeq [42]. Unlike edgeR and DESeq, 
which  adopt  negative  binomial  models,  and  NOIseq  and 
SAMseq, which are non-parametric, Cuffdiff and EBSeq can 
be  used  to  compare  differentially  expressed  genes  by 
employing transcript-based detection methods. Many of the 
programs  accept  read  count  data  as  input,  which  can  be 
produced by using HTSeq [43] or BEDTools [44]. Similarly 
to  Cuffdiff,  Ballgown  program  [45]  is  employed  for 
differential  expression  analysis  using  read  mapping  data 
from StringTie [26] (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/ 
index.shtml?t=manual). The above programs adopt one or 
more of the several available normalization methods (total 
count,  upper  quartile,  median,  DESeq  normalization, 
trimmed  mean  of  M  values,  quantile  and  RPKM  nor-
malization)  to  correct  biases  that  may  appear  between 
samples (sequencing depth [33]) or within sample (gene 
length [46] and GC contents [45]).

Although  many  programs  have  been  developed,  one 
research group reported that there may be large differences 
between these programs and that no single method may be 
optimal under all experimental conditions [48]. Thus, it may 
be  difficult  for  most  of  users  with  no  or  weak  statistical 
background to select a proper method. However, because 
RNA-seq data sets are rapidly accumulating, we expect that 
new bioinformatics tools for differential expression will be 
developed, which will function robustly under a wide range 
of conditions.

Conclusion

Numerous bioinformatics programs have been developed 
for RNA-seq data analysis. Even tools developed for a same 
purpose  are  based  on  distinct  approaches  using  different 
algorithms and models. The diversity of the methodology 
makes  it  possible  to  customize  analysis  protocols  by 
choosing a program that provides the best fit to each specific 
goal.  In  this  review,  we  described  the  routine  RNA-seq 
analysis  workflow,  focusing  on  transcriptome  reconstruc-
tion and expression quantification, and also introduced its 
related bioinformatics programs. Therefore, we expect that 
this review will be helpful for preparing a specific pipeline for 
RNA-seq data analysis, enabling to design new biological 
experiments.
