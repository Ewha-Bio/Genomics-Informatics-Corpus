Abstract 
Cells consistently face stressful  conditions, which  cause 
them to modulate a variety of intracellular processes and 
adapt to  these  environmental  changes  via  regulation  of 
gene  expression.  Hyperosmotic  and  oxidative  stresses 
are significant stressors that induce cellular damage, and 
finally cell death. In this study, oligonucleotide microarrays 
were  employed  to  investigate  mRNA  level  changes  in 
cells exposed to hyperosmotic or oxidative conditions.  In 
addition, since heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is one of the 
most  inducible  stress  proteins  and  plays  pivotal  role  to 
protect  cells  against  stressful  condition,  we  performed 
microarray  analysis  in  HSP7G-overexpressing  cells  to 
identify  the  genes  expressed  in  a  HSP7G-dependent 
manner. Under hyperosmotic or oxidative stress conditions, 
a  variety  of  genes  showed  altered  expression.  Down(cid:173)
regulation  of protein  phosphatase1  beta  (PP1  beta)  and 
sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 (SPPase1) was 
detected in both stress conditions. Microarray analysis of 
HSP70-overexpressing cells  demonstrated that diverse 
mRNA species  depend  on  the  level  of cellular  HSP70. 
Genes encoding  lysyl  oxidase,  thrombospondin  1,  and 
procollagen  displayed  altered  expression  in  all  tested 
conditions.  The  results  of  this  study  will  be  useful  to 
construct networks of stress response genes.

Introduction 
Exposure of cells to sudden stress deleteriously affects 
their survival.  However, a transition from a mild to harsh 
stress  or  repeated  exposure  to  stress  renders  cells 
stress  tolerance.  Cells  can  modulate  a  variety  of 
intracellular processes by changing  gene expression to 
adapt  to  new  stressful  conditions.  This  conserved 
cellular response to harmful stimuli is referred as 'stress 
response'. 

Hyperosmotic  and  oxidative  stresses  present 
significant challenges to cells.  Cells respond to osmotic 
stress by compensational changes in cell volume, water 
content,  and  intracellular  solute  concentration.  Some 
genes  induced  by  osmotic  stress  have  been  identified 
(KOltz and Csonka, 1999; Cai eta/., 2004). High levels of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes cellular damage 
and  induces  apoptosis,  which  is  mediated  through  the 
mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway  and  results 
in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Kemp et 
a/.,  2003).  Although  the  gene  expressions  of  some 
genes related to stress response are known, global gene 
expression patterns are not. 

Heat shock proteins (also known as stress proteins) 
have  prominent  roles  in  stress  tolerance.  Heat shock 
protein 70 (HSP70) is the most inducible protein during 
stress response and is  highly conserved  from  bacteria 
to  mammals  (Tanaka  et  a/.,  1988).  HSP70  can  be 
induced  by  various  stressors  including  hyperthermia, 
hyperosmolarity,  oxidative  stress,  heavy  metals,  and 
amino acid analogues (Morimoto eta/.,  1992; Abe eta/., 
1998; Fukamachi eta/.,  1998). The induction of HSP70 
has been shown to enhance cell  survival after exposure 
to  harmful  stimuli  (Jaattela,  1999).  HSP70  has  an 
important  function  as  a  molecular  chaperone  (Hartl, 
1996) and  an  anti-apoptotic  molecule  (Li  eta/.,  2000a; 
Beere eta/., 2000; Saleh eta/., 2000). 

In  this  study,  to  profile  global  gene  expression  under 
hyperosmotic or oxidative stress conditions, oligonucleotide 
array analyses were performed.  Since HSP70 plays  an 
essential  role  in  the  acquisition  of  stress  tolerance, 
altered  gene expressions were  also analyzed  in  HSP7o(cid:173)
overexpressing  cells.  We found  that  a  number of genes 
altered their expressions in  response to  hyperosmotic or 
oxidative stress, and the HSP70 level in a cell. These kinds 
of  altered  gene  expressions  act  as  countermeasures 
against stress, and help maintain homeostasis.

Materials and Methods 
Cell culture and treatment 
NIH3T3 and  HSP70-overexpressing  NIH3T3 cells were 
grown  in  DMEM  media  supplemented  with  10  %  heat(cid:173)
inactivated  fetal  bovine  serum  and  50  11g/ml  penicillin 
and  streptomycin  in  a  5  %  C02  incubator at 3TC.  For 
hyperosmotic or oxidative stress conditions,  cells were 
kept in media containing 130 mM sodium chloride or 1.0 
mM H202 for 2  hours.  For heat shock condition,  culture 
plates containing cells were tightly wrapped with parafilm 
and 
indicated 
temperature for 30 min,  then kept in C02 incubator at 3 
TC for indicated times.

Preparation  of  whole  cell  extract  and  Western 
blot analysis 

After washing  with  phosphate-buffered  saline,  the cells 
were  scraped  and  collected  in  extraction  buffer  (1% 
Triton X-100,  1% sodium deoxycholate, 25 mM Tris-HCI, 
pH  7.4,  0.1%  SDS,  137 mM  NaCI,  1 mM  EDTA).  The 
collected  cells  were  incubated  on  ice  for  30  min.  The 
lysate was centrifuged and quantitated with BCA Protein 
Assay Reagents (Pierce, IL, USA). The equal amounts of 
total  proteins were separated on a  10% SDS-PAGE gel 
and  transferred  to  a  nitrocellulose  membrane.  HSP70 
band was detected by sequential treatment with an anti(cid:173)
HSP70  antibody  purchased  from  Santa  Cruz  (Santa 
Cruz,  USA),  an  HRP-conjugated  secondary  antibody, 
and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit. 

Northern blot analysis 

For  Northern  blot  analysis,  1 0  11g  of  total  RNA  was 
fractionated on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel, blotted 
onto  Hybond-N+  nylon  membrane  (Amersham,  NJ, 
USA).  The  32P-Iabeled  probes  by  random  priming  kit 
(Amersham,  NJ,  USA) were hybridized to the blots at 
62°C  in  a Modified Church  Hybridization  Buffer (0.25 M 
Na2HP04,  1 mM EDTA,  1% casein,  7% SDS, adjust pH 
to 7.4 with  H3P04).  The blots were washed  under high 
stringency  and  autoradiographed  on  the  X-ray  films 
(AGFA, Germany).

Changes of Gene Expression in  NIH3T3 Cells Exposed to Osmotic and Oxidative Stresses  69 

Results and Discussion 

After  NIH3T3  cells  were  exposed  to  NaCI  or  HzOz, 
HSP?O  induction was  monitored  as  a marker of stress 
response,  since  HSP?O  is  one  of  the  most  inducible 
proteins during stress response. HSP?O was enormously 
induced 1 0 h after treatment with either 130 mM NaCI or 1 
mM HzOz for 2 h (Figure 1A). Total RNAs were isolated from 
cells  exposed  to  these  stressful  conditions.  Synthesized 
cDNAs  were  hybridized  to  a MAGIC Oligo-Mouse  11 K® 

identified.  Under 

chip (Macrogen  Inc.). This experiment was performed in 
triplicate and genes with significantly and  consistently 
altered  expressions  were 
the 
hyperosmotic condition, 12 genes were up-regulated and 
16  down-regulated  (Table  1 ).  The  most  prominently 
increased  expression  was  nuclear factor of kappa  light 
chain gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (NFKBIA). 
NFKBIA inhibits the  action  of NF-kappaB  by forming  a 
heterodimer with  NF-Kappa  B,  which  is  a  transcription 
factor for the expression of many genes involved  in  cell

Changes of Gene Expression in  NIH3T3 Cells Exposed to Osmotic and Oxidative Stresses  71 

proliferation,  differentiation,  apoptosis,  or  metastasis 
(Curran  et  a/.,  2002).  It  has  been  reported  that  the 
inhibition of NFKBIA phosphorylation sensitizes cells to 
radiation  (Ding  eta/.,  2003).  From our results,  the  most 
affected  transcription factor might be  NF-kappaB,  since 
its inhibitor level was increased 19 fold under hyperosmotic 
stress.  On 
the  other  hand,  eukaryotic  translation 
elongation  factor  1  alpha  1  was  down-regulated.  It  is 
generally known that the cells under stress suppress the 
de novo synthesis of protein except some stress-related 
proteins.  Our  results  show  that  translation  elongation 
factor 1 might be important for the suppression of protein 
synthesis in conditions of hyperosmotic stress.  Polo-like 
kinase  2,  which  regulates  cell  cycle  was  also  down(cid:173)
regulated  (Ma eta/., 2003).  Protein phosphatase 1 beta 
isoform (PP1  beta) and sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 
1 (SPPase1) vvere decreased by 2.7 and 4.1 fold, respectively. 
The fine regulation of protein phosphorylation is essential 
to transmit proper signals intracellularly. The expression 
level  of  PP1  can  be  specifically  affectect by  various 
cellular stresses  (Amador eta/.,  2004).  These  authors 
suggested that the monitoring of PP1  expression  could 
be  a  useful  diagnostic  tool  for  cellular  stress,  since 
alterations  of  PP1  expression  is  an  immediate  early 
stress response, which occurs before heat shock protein 
alterations.  From  our  chip  data,  it  was  supported  that 
PP1  could  be  a  sensitive  stress  marker  molecule  like 
HSP70.  When  we  observed  the  induction  levels  of 
HSP70 mRNA 2h after heat shock, heat shock markedly 
induced HSP70 mRNA as shown in Figure 1 B (left panel) 
Whereas  HSP70  mRNA  was  not  detected  within  2  h 
under  oxidative  stress  condition,  and  was  induced

extremely  low  level  of  HSP70  mRNA  2  h  under 
hyperosmotic  stress  (Figure  1 B,  left  panel).  In  both 
cases,  HSP70  mRNA was  detectable 6  h or 12 h after 
treating  with  stressors  (Fig  1 B,  right  panel).  Our result 
suggests that  immediate  induction  of HSP70 seems to 
depend  on  the  type  of stress.  Sphingosin-1-phosphate 
(SPP) has multiple functions as a second messenger in 
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (Johnson 
et  a/.,  2003).  The  loss  of  SPPase  results  in  cellular 
tolerance to stress,  and  the overexpression  of SPPase 
provokes  apoptosis  (Mandala,  2001 ).  Therefore,  the 
regulation  of  the  sphingosin-1-phosphate 
level  by 
reducing  SPPase1  expression  could  be  an  important 
response to hyperosmotic stress. 

In  oxidatively  stressed  cells,  12  genes  were  up(cid:173)
(Table2).  Cyclin 
regulated  and  36  down-regulated 
dependent  kinase  inhibitor  1a  (CDKN1A,  p21)  was 
increased  3.8  fold.  Cell  cycle  arrest  is  correlated  with 
down-regulation  of  cyclin  D1  and  up-regulation  of 
CDKN1A  (Todd  et  a/.,  2004).  Acutely  challenged  cells 
usually  show  cell  cycle  arrest,  and  adopt  a  stress 
response 
the  applied  stress.  Rapidly 
increased CDKN1A might have a major role on cell cycle 
arrest  in  oxidative  condition.  We  observed  obvious 
increases in metallothionein 1 (MT1) expression. MT1  is 
small  sulfhydryl-rich  protein 
in  cellular 
protection,  probably  by 
inhibiting  oxidative  stress 
(Wanpen eta/., 2004;  Li  eta/., 2004). Decreases in PP1 
beta  (3.0  fold)  and  SPPase1  (3.6  fold)  were  also 
observed  under  oxidative  stress  condition.  Genes 
encoding 
thrombospondin  1

Fig.  3.  RT-PCR of the  genes  regulated  by hyperosmolarity,  oxidative stress,  or HSP?G- overexpression.  RNA was  isolated from 
NIH3T3 cells treated  with  130 mM  NaCI  (A),  1 mM  H202 (B),  or stably transfected  with  hsp70 gene.  NFKBIA stands for nuclear 
factor of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha. CDKN1A and TNFSF9 mean cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 
1a (p21) and tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 9,  respectively. 

regulated under hyperosmotic and oxidative stress. LOX 
is  an  enzyme that  initiates the  covalent  crosslinking  of 
polypeptide  chains  within  extracellular  matrix  (ECM) 
proteins,  collagen  and  elastin.  LOX  expression  was 
regulated  by  diverse  stimuli  including  growth  factors, 
angiotensin II, retinoic acid, and shear stress (Kagna and 
Li,  2003).  LOX  has  roles  in  stress  fiber  formation  and 
focal  adhesion  assembly  (Li  et a/.,  2000b).  Moreover, 
LOX is  one  of the  genes  known  to  be  dysregulated  in 
diseases  associated  with  oxidative  stress  (Li  et  a/., 
2004).  It has been  suggested that LOX may have other 
important biological functions in addition to its role as an 
ECM  cross 
linker.  Another  ECM  molecule,  TSP1 
expression  was  decreased  about  5  fold  by  both 
hyperosmotic  and  oxidative  stress.  TSP1  can  exert 
cellular  adhesive  changes  and  pro- or  anti-angiogenic 
effects.  It was reported  that TSP1  might be  involved  in 
cellular  adaptation  to  cellular  damage  (Ann  Elzie  and 
Murphy-UIIrich, 2004; Espey eta/., 2003). Collagens are 
major  constituents  of  the  ECR,  and 
large 
superfamilies. They are vital  components of connective 
tissue,  and  are  centrally  involved  in  the  formation  of 
fibrillar  and  microfibrillar  networks  of the  ECM,  and  in 
basement membranes as well  as of other structures of 
the ECM (Geise eta/., 2003). Changes in the balance of 
ECR  molecules  can  lead  to  collagen-related  diseases 
(Siwik and  Colucci,  2004).  In  this  study,  we found  that 
cells under hyperosmotic or oxidative stress rapidly and 
obviously change the expression levels of ECM proteins. 
Cells under stress are able to induce stress response 
to  prevent  cellular  damage  by  modulating  gene 
expression.  HSP70  is  one  of the  most  inducible  genes 
involved  in  stress  response.  We  generated  HSP7G(cid:173)
overexpressing  NIH3T3  cells  (NIH3T3-HSP70),  and 
observed  cell  viability  comparing 
to  empty  vector 
transfected  cells (NIH3T3-EV) under lethal  hyperosmotic 
condition  (Figure  2).  Since  HSP70  has  pivotal  roles  in 
stress  tolerance,  we  wanted 
to  know  which  gene 

form 

expressions  are  affected  by changes  in  the  intracellular 
level of HSP70. Microarray analysis showed that 19 genes 
were  up-regulated  and  24  down-regulated  in  HSP7G(cid:173)
overexpressing  cells  (Table  3).  The  overexpression  of 
HSP70 influenced the expressions of various molecules 
involving  transcription,  translation,  cell  division  and 
growth,  transport,  proteolysis,  cell  adhesion  and  others. 
The  signal  transducing  molecule,  STAT,  was  down(cid:173)
regulated  2.9  fold.  It  suggests  that  HSP70  directly  or 
indirectly  affects  STAT  expression  and  mediates  their 
signal  transducing  pathways. 
Interestingly,  LOX  (3.1 
folds), TSP1  (7.7 folds),  and procollagen type I (3.0 folds) 
were commonly down-regulated in HSP7G-overexpressing 
NIH3T3  cells.  The  ECM  is  important  for  many  cellular 
processes such as cell  division,  migration,  differentiation, 
and  death.  Abnormalities  of the  ECM  might be  closely 
rheumatoid  arthritis, 
linked 
restenosis, 
invasion  and  metastasis,  and 
atherosclerosis  (Lee  eta/.,  2004).  This  means that the 
primary  molecules 
targeted  by  hyperosmotic  and 
oxidative  insults  are  constituents  of the  ECM,  and  that 
HSP70 has key roles  in  ECM  integrity.  HSP70 is being 
considered for possibly use as a therapeutical molecule 
in  diseases  related  with  these  protein  families.  We 
performed RT-PCR to confirm our microarray results as 
shown in Figure 3. These results showed that NFKBIA in 
hyperosmotic conditions, CDKN1A in oxidative conditions, 
and  TNFSF9  in  HSP70-overexpressing  cells  were  up(cid:173)
regulated,  in accord with the microarray results.
