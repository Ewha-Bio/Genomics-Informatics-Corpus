After the initial enthusiasm of the human genome project, it became clear that without additional data pertaining to the 
epigenome,  i.e.,  how  the  genome  is  marked  at  specific  developmental  periods,  in  different  tissues,  as  well  as  across 

individuals and species―the promise of the genome sequencing project in understanding biology cannot be fulfilled. This 

realization prompted several large-scale efforts to map the epigenome, most notably the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE)  project.  While  there  is  essentially  a  single  genome  in  an  individual,  there  are  hundreds  of  epigenomes, 
corresponding  to  various  types  of  epigenomic  marks  at  different  developmental  times  and  in  multiple  tissue  types. 
Unprecedented advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, by virtue of low cost and high speeds that 
continue  to  improve  at  a  rate  beyond  what  is  anticipated  by  Moore’s  law  for  computer  hardware  technologies,  have 
revolutionized molecular biology and genetics research, and have in turn prompted innovative ways to reduce the problem 
of measuring cellular events involving DNA or RNA into a sequencing problem. In this article, we provide a brief overview of 
the epigenome, the various types of epigenomic data afforded by NGS, and some of the novel discoveries yielded by the 
epigenomics projects. We also provide ample references for the reader to get in-depth information on these topics.

Introduction

 Next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  has  resulted  in  an 
exponential  growth  in  data  in  the  past  decade,  primarily 
fueled by the general interest of the scientific community in 
functionally annotating the human genome. The power of 
high-throughput parallel sequencing was deployed to cha-
racterize human genetic variation, in an international effort 
launched in 2008, called the 1000 Genomes Project, with the 
hope  that  such  a  large-scale  endeavor  would  help  in 
identifying all the underlying genetic differences that lead to 
disease resistance/susceptibility [1].

In  the  meantime,  based  on  numerous  genome-wide 
association studies (GWAS), it was realized that 93% of the 
trait-associated polymorphisms within the human popula-
tion were located in non-coding regions, potentially within 
cis-regulatory elements [2]. In fact, in the mid-1970s, King 
and  Wilson  [3]  pointed  out  the  importance  of  mapping 
regulatory events and hinted that a small difference in the 

time/level  of  activation  of  a  single  gene  could  influence 
overall systemic development. They estimated the genetic 
distance  between  human  and  chimpanzee  to  be  much 
smaller than the corresponding genetic distance between the 
sibling species of Drosophila, thereby underscoring the need 
to  explore  regulatory/expression  differences  at  different 
times as a basis to explain the evolutionary differences at the 
organismal level [3].

Why the Epigenome?

A  mechanistic  understanding  of  spatio-temporal  gene 
expression in eukaryotes is far from complete. While genetic 
differences might be expected to explain expression diver-
gence across species and expression variability across indi-
viduals  of  a  population,  it  cannot  explain  how  almost- 
identical  genomes  in  more  than  200  different  cell  types 
within an individual organism can drive such varied expres-
sion profiles specific to each cell type [4]. DNA is packaged

context  of  several  epigenetic  marks 
on chromatin; ranging from DNA me-
thylation, nucleosome positioning pat-
terns  affecting  the  size  and  distri-
bution of DNase I hypersensitive sites, 
transcriptional  activity  at  non-coding 
sites  leading  to  the  production  of 
small  and  long  RNA,  chemical  mo-
difications  of  histone  moieties  (e.g., 
mono-,  di-  and  tri-methylation  of the 
4th  lysine  of  the  H3  subunit),  and 
chromatin  folding  to  form  localized 
structures  in  3D  nuclear  space  (anti-

in a nucleoprotein complex structure called chromatin that 
is highly dynamic, in that its “states” vary from one cell type 
to another. Therefore, a possible solution to this conundrum 
is  to  analyze  these  “states”  at  the  genome  level,  i.e., 
characterize the landscape of the epigenome, which further 
qualifies  and  modulates  the  functional  effect  of  genetic 
information [5]. Epigenome, meaning “on or above geno-
mes,” refers to such sequence-independent heritable pro-
perties  of  the  genome  that  can  modulate  the  functional 
output of the genome. While, as described initially, heri-
tability is an important qualifying criterion of an epigenomic 
mark (most notably, DNA methylation) [6], currently, the 
term epigenome is loosely used to encompass a myriad of 
chemical changes to DNA or histone proteins, chromatin 
accessibility, small and long (non-coding) RNA localization, 
and higher-order DNA organization (including nucleosome 
occupancy and positioning, and 3D chromatin interactions) 
(Fig. 1) [7-9]. The ultimate combined effect of the epige-
nome  is  to  determine  the  transcriptome  (the  set  of  all 
transcripts) of a cell precisely. Epigenomic features influence 
the regulatory program of each gene’s expression in several 
ways: they define the local environment of specific processes 
by regulating the chromatin architecture, determine access 
of transcription factors to DNA, as well as serve to keep a 
“memory” of cell type-specific features facilitating herita-
bility of epigenetic characteristics [10, 11].

The Wild West of Epigenetic Marks and the 
Impact of NGS Techonologies

The will of the global scientific community to sequence 
the human genome spurred advances in sequencing tech-
nologies that led to what is now known as NGS. The im-
provement in cost and speed of sequencing in the last decade 
has significantly surpassed the analogous improvement in 

computer technologies as predicted by Moore’s law [12]. 
Well beyond the initial goal of sequencing complete geno-
mes of several species, NGS is now routinely used as a tool 
to investigate the diverse array of cellular events involving 
DNA  or  RNA,  such  as  the  identification  of  genomic  loci 
bound by a specific protein, the detection of pairs of spatially 
proximal  or  interacting  chromosomal  loci,  etc.  Broad 
availability of NGS technologies has led to a paradigm shift 
in molecular biology research; from probing singular cellular 
events to an unbiased genome-scale mapping of such events, 
and has enabled genome-wide elucidation of the epigenomic 
landscapes in hundreds of cell types, across developmental 
times, in human, as well as other species [13]. 

As mentioned earlier, it is the locus-specific “epigenetic 
code” (a specific signature or combination of several epi-
genetic modifications) that helps define a cell’s expression 
program and identity [14], thereby distinguishing it from 
other  cell  types.  Unlike  the  largely  static  genome  of  an 
individual, the epigenome is highly variable and dynamic; 
yet, many of these marks can be passed down a cell’s lineage, 
or  from  one  generation  to  the  next.  In  this  section,  we 
describe several well-studied epigenomic marks and outline 
what is known about their role in gene expression modu-
lation. We will also outline various NGS-based assays that 
are used in comprehensively mapping each of the epigenetic 
marks (Table 1) [15-34].

DNA methylation

One of the more stable and heritable epigenetic marks is 
DNA methylation. The human genome is highly methylated; 
approximately 80% of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are 
chemically modified at their fifth carbon atom with a methyl 
group [35]. Historically, DNA methylation was associated 
with transcriptional silencing (as evidenced by many pro-
moter-based studies) [36]. Although genome-scale profiling

of this epigenetic mark revealed that in some instances DNA 
methylation is correlated with transcriptional activation, it is 
enriched in the gene bodies of active genes [37]. Thus, the 
associations  between  an  epigenomic  mark  and  functional 
output may be location-specific, thereby complicating their 
functional interpretation. 

The  available  assays  for  identifying  methylated  CpG 
dinucleotides in a genome vary in terms of resolution and 
cost.  Restriction  enzyme-based  assays  (e.g.,  methylation- 
sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing) involve the diges-
tion  of  genomic  DNA  with  several  methylation-sensitive 
enzymes  [15],  followed  by  sequencing  of  digested  frag-
ments.  Affinity-based  enrichment  assays,  such  as  methy-
lated  DNA  immunoprecipitation  sequencing  and  methyl- 
CpG-binding  domain  protein  sequencing  [16,  17],  selec-
tively target methylated fragments (usually up to 100 bp) 
using  an  antibody,  followed  by  sequencing  of  those  frag-
ments. Both these methods are low-resolution and essen-
tially qualitative. Chemical modification methods, such as 
bisulfite sequencing (BS), have higher resolution and pro-

vide quantitative estimates of methylation. They exploit the 
fact that when treated with sodium bisulfite, unmethylated 
cytosines convert to uracil while methylated cytosines do 
not.  Thus,  mapping  of  sequenced  fragments  reveals  the 
quantitative estimate of methylation at each CpG locus. The 
two variations to BS include reduced representation BS and 
whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or methylC-seq (whole- 
genome  BS);  the  former  employs  restriction  enzyme  di-
gestion to target certain regions of interest prior to sodium 
bisulfite  treatment  [18],  whereas  the  latter  couples  the 
chemical treatment with whole-genome sequencing [19].

Upon  the  discovery  that  5-hydroxymethylcytosine  (5- 
hmC: an intermediate produced during active DNA deme-
thylation) and 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) are both resistant 
to  bisulfite  treatment,  it  became  critical  to  distinguish 
between the different methyl variants, including 5-formyl-
cytosine  and  5-carboxylcytosine.  To  this  end,  oxidative 
bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq) was invented as an improve-
ment for methylC-seq to measure single base-pair resolution 
methylation levels of 5-mC [20]. This is accomplished by

oxidizing  5-hmCs  (using  potassium  perruthenate)  before 
sodium bisulfite treatment, such that they are now sensitive 
to the subjected chemical conversion to uracil, thus ensuring 
that the remaining cytosines are all 5-mCs.

Histone modifications

Chromosomal DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, 
essentially composed of 4 kinds of subunits; viz., H2A, H2B, 
H3, and H4. These proteins are subject to chemical modi-
fications  at  specific  residues  of  histone  tails;  some  well- 
studied  modifications  include  phosphorylation,  methyla-
tion,  and  ubiquitination  [38].  These  modifications  are 
involved  in  setting  the  stage  for  directed  transcriptional 
activation and repression by controlling DNA accessibility or 
recruitment of other protein complexes. This idea has been 
extended into the “histone code” hypothesis [39, 40]－that 
complex combinations of distinct histone modifications, like 
H3K27me3  (a  mark  of  repressed  regions),  H3K4me3  (a 
mark of gene promoters), and H3K27ac (a mark of trans-
criptionally  active  regions),  etc.  [41],  underlie  specific 
transcriptional  programs.  This  notion  has  been  further 
extended in more recent works into an ‘epigenomic code’ to 
include epigenomic marks other than histone modifications 
[42].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of DNA-histone 
complexes  is  achieved  by  cross-linking  histones  with  the 
DNA, digesting the cross-linked DNA, and then using an 
antibody specific to the N-tail modification of interest (to 
any of the >100 post-translational modifications to histone 
tails  and  globules  [43]),  followed  by  sequencing  of  the 
purified DNA fragments. This method is called chromatin 
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and was pri-
marily  used  to  map  the  genomic  locations  of  DNA-asso-
ciated proteins. Due to the relatively large fragment size, the 
mapped sequence reads thus obtained from ChIP-seq [21] 
provide  a  low-resolution  localization  map  of  modified 
histones in the genome. An alternative strategy, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation-exonuclease  (ChIP-exo), uses exonu-
clease to digest the precipitated DNA fragment from either 
end to better resolve the modified loci at base-pair resolution 
[22].

Nucleosome positioning and occupancy

The packaging of DNA coiled around histones produces 
distinct structures called nucleosomes that form repeating 
units with approximately 147 bp wrapped around each unit, 
separated by varying lengths of linker DNA. The occupancy 
and  periodic  positioning  of  nucleosomes  can  control  the 
accessibility  of  DNA  to  transcription  factors  [23]  and 
DNases,  as  well  as  the  transcription  rate  of  active  gene 
bodies [44], and are thus considered an epigenetic mark. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  1,  2014

Biochemically  active  regulatory  regions  are  generally  de-
pleted of nucleosomes [45], whereas inactive repeat regions 
(heterochromatin) have higher affinity to form nucleosome 
structures [46]. 

A map of nucleosome occupancy is generated by using 
micrococcal  nuclease  (MNase)  for  digestion  of  the  chro-
matin  [23],  followed  by  high-throughput  sequencing－a 
technique called MNase-seq. MNase digests all linker DNA 
but  preserves  the  DNA  wound  around  the  nucleosome; 
when the latter is sequenced and mapped to the reference, a 
map of the original positioning of nucleosomes is obtained. 
Due to some inherent biases in MNase affinity (preference to 
AT-rich regions) and the lack of single base-pair resolution 
data,  attempts  were  made  to  develop  more  precise  tech-
nologies  [24].  An  MNase-independent  technique  that  in-
volves chemically modifying engineered histones to bring 
about cleavage of DNA wound around histones allows direct 
mapping of nucleosome centers.

Chromatin accessibility

Epigenetic mechanisms, such as chromatin accessibility, 
impact transcription factor binding to DNA, transcriptional 
specificity, and hence, transcriptional regulation. Open and 
easily accessible regions of DNA within the chromatin are 
indicative  of  local  territories  of  transcriptional  activity. 
Measuring “openness” of DNA at different regions genome- 
wide, based on the DNase hypersensitivity assay, has helped 
discover  several  classes  of  functional  elements,  like  pro-
moters and enhancers [47]. It has also aided in identifying 
cell-type specific behaviors by comparison of accessibility 
profiles [47].

Regions of accessible chromatin are reflective of active 
regulatory sites. The enzyme DNase I is capable of digesting 
DNA in nucleosome-depleted regions (i.e., free unwound 
DNA).  Post-digestion  sequencing  reveals  large  blocks  of 
DNase  hypersensitive  sites  (DHS)  in  chromatin  (DNase- 
seq)  [25,  48],  which,  upon  further  deep  sequencing,  can 
reveal up to 40-bp footprints of protected regions (poten-
tially bound by transcription factors). These smaller regions 
are called digital genomic footprints (DGF) [26]. Formal-
dehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements sequencing 
is another technique that, by deep-sequencing random frag-
ments of the genome post-crosslinking, measures the fre-
quency  of  shearing  at  different  loci,  thus  quantifying 
accessibility at high resolution, because free DNA that is 
unbound by factors is more susceptible to shearing [27]. 

3D chromatin architecture

The  array  of  nucleosomes  organized  in  30-nm  fibers, 
called chromatin, has diverse functions well beyond mere 
compaction.  Coordinated  activity  of  distal  elements  is 

www.genominfo.org

orchestrated  by  short-  and  long-range  DNA  interactions, 
which is determined by the 3D chromatin structure as well 
as the local environment of individual genes. For instance, 
chromatin  conformation/looping  mediates  a  promoter’s 
access  to  its  enhancers,  thereby  determining  the  trans-
criptional  fate  of  a  gene  [49].  Spatial  proximity  can  be 
determined  by  measuring  the  interaction  frequencies  of 
linearly  distal  fragments  by  a  suite  of  chromosome  con-
formation capture (3C)-based assays.

Chromosomes assume a specific tertiary structure with 
profound implications for  cellular function and fate [49]. 
While  the  overall  chromatin  structure  cannot  be  directly 
measured,  measuring  spatial  distances  between  pairs  of 
genomic loci has become increasingly more efficient with the 
arrival  of  3C  technologies  [28].  Treatment  with  formal-
dehyde crosslinks spatially proximal DNA loci in cells, and 
then post-digestion, the resulting fragments are allowed to 
ligate in a weak solution (cross-linked fragments ligate with 
higher frequency than random fragments). This frequency is 
quantitatively  assessed  by  quantitative  polymerase  chain 
reaction.  Known  loci  are  selected  for  by  using  sequence- 
specific probes that allow assaying specific pairs of regions in 
so-called  one-versus-one  mapping.  Circular  chromosome 
conformation capture, or 4C, allows whole-genome map-
ping  of  all  spatial  interactions  of  one  specific  region  of 
interest  (one-vs-all  mapping)  [29].  Chromosome  confor-
mation capture carbon copy, or 5C, deploys several anchors 
and primers to ensure targeting of several regions at once to 
attain  higher  coverage  (many-vs-many)  [30].  Finally,  the 
most  recent  derivative  of  3C,  namely  Hi-C,  permits  sur-
veying of the whole genome [31] in a relatively unbiased 
fashion for frequencies of spatially interacting pairs of loci in 
the  entire  genome  without  restricting  the  exploration  to 
selected loci. This was done with reasonably high resolution, 
where  the  human  genome  was  partitioned  into  100-kb 
blocks  and  the  spatial  interaction  between  every  pair  of 
intra-chromosomal  regions  was  assessed,  while  inter- 
chromosomal  interactions  have  been  mapped  at  1-Mb 
resolution [31].

A variation of Hi-C, called chromatin interaction analysis 
by paired-end tag sequencing  (ChIA-PET), involves a ChIP 
reaction to isolate chromatin interactions involving regions 
of DNA that bind to a protein of interest [32]. For example, 
an  antibody  targeting  RNA  polymerase  II  can be  used to 
precipitate interactions involving a promoter and another 
interacting  region,  such  as  a  distal  enhancer  or  other 
promoters [50].

Non-coding RNA localization

Specific  classes  of  non-coding  RNA―short  RNAs  (viz. 
micro RNA [miRNA], short interfering RNA [siRNA], and 

piwi-interacting RNA [piRNA]) and long non-coding RNAs 
(lncRNA)―regulate  gene  expression  through  epigenetic 
mechanisms, influencing several cellular processes, like X 
chromosome  inactivation  [51],  genomic  imprinting  [52], 
and some cellular processes [53], and cancer [54]. LncRNAs 
tether  epigenetic  complexes  capable  of  methylating  DNA 
and modifying histones to the chromatin, enabling allele- 
and  locus-specific  regulation.  For  example,  lncRNA  Xist 
covers  the  inactive  X  chromosome  and  recruits  PCR2,  a 
Polycomb complex responsible for trimethylation of H3K27 
[51]. Furthermore, lncRNAs, by virtue of their length, are 
suited for orchestrating specific regulatory events particular 
to a target locus [55].

Additionally, miRNA (~22 nucleotides long) have shown 
to be linked with cancer and can act as either oncogenes or 
tumor-suppressor genes. They can be involved in establi-
shing DNA methylation and regulating histone modification 
by interacting with their target mRNA to alter chromatin of 
the corresponding DNA template [56]. siRNA, and its inter-
ference machinery has also been implicated in the formation 
of heterochromatin [57].

A  catalog  of  small  RNAs  has  been  generated  by  deep 
sequencing of total RNA from whole transcriptomes using 
smRNA-seq technology [34]. Selection of smRNA can be 
carried out by sequential ligation of adapters to its unique 5’ 
mono/triphosphate ends, produced as a result of processing 
the smRNA population in the cell [58]. On the other hand, 
lncRNA are poly-adenylated, and much of the challenge in 
identifying them from whole-genome mRNA-seq data [33] 
lies in the computational and analytical domains [59].

Epigenome Projects and Consortia

Spurred by unprecedented advances in sequencing tech-
nologies as well as other assays, and a recognition of the 
potential of NGS in determining the epigenomic landscape, 
several research consortia have formed to generate genome- 
wide maps of human epigenomic marks by sharing resources 
and  publishing  standard  operating  procedures,  thereby 
ensuring best practices and high-quality datasets [60]. One 
of  the  first  concerted  efforts  in  this  direction  was  the 
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project, started 
in 2003 and funded by the National Human Genome Re-
search Institute at the National Institute of Health (NIH- 
NHGRI), which involved hundreds of researchers in dozens 
of  labs  across  the  globe.  The  ENCODE  consortium  has 
performed  1,650  epigenomic  profiling  on  147  cell  lines 
assessing the transcriptome, transcription factor binding for 
dozens of transcription factors, chromatin topology, histone 
modifications, DNA methylation, and more (http://www. 
encodeproject.org)  [13].  Five  years  after 
launching

ENCODE,  the  NIH  funded  a  second  large-scale  mapping 
project  called  the  Roadmap  Epigenomics  Program.  While 
ENCODE  focused  on  generating  data  in  cell  lines,  the 
Roadmap  program  focuses  on  mapping  epigenomes  of 
high-priority  normal  human  primary  tissue  and  human 
embryonic  stem  cell  (ESC)-derived  cell  types.  As  of  May 
2012, the Roadmap includes 61 “complete” epigenomes (of 
a variety of cell types) (http://www.roadmapepigenomics. 
org) [61]. The data repository can be accessed interactively 
at  Human  Epigenome  Atlas  (http://www.genboree.org/
epigenomeatlas/multiGridViewerPublic.rhtml),  via 
the 
Washington  University  Epigenome  Browser  (http://ww
w.epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser),  as  well  as  the 
UCSC  Genome  Browser  (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu). 
Further, the NIH Roadmap is one of the members of an even 
larger  consortium  called  the  International  Human  Epi-
genome Consortium (IHEC; http://www.ihec-epigenomes. 
org), formed by institutions in 7 countries. To name a few, 
BLUEPRINT: a European initiative to generate about 100 
reference  epigenomic  maps;  the  CREST/IHEC  team  in 
Japan:  to  produce  reference  epigenomes  specializing  in 
gastrointestinal  epithelial  cells,  vascular  endothelial  cells, 
and  cells  of  reproductive  organs;  and  the  Epigenomic 
Platform Program: a Canadian program to map epigenomic 
variations  in  disease  cells.  Together,  these  efforts  are 
expected  to  generate  over  1,000  reference  human  epige-
nomes.  Other  epigenome  mapping  efforts  focused  on 
specific  disease  areas  have  also  been  undertaken.  These 
include the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), funded by the 
NIH in 2006 [62], which is a part of the International Cancer 
Genome Consortium (ICGC; http://www.icgc.org) that was 
officially put together in 2008.

What Have We Learned?

By providing a rich functional annotation of the genome, 
the  numerous  epigenomic  datasets  have  significantly  im-
proved  our  ability  to  probe  the  mechanisms  of  gene 
regulation as well as shed light on disease processes me-
diated  by  perturbation  of  normal  regulatory  processes.  A 
collection of 30 scientific reports published with the initial 
release of the ENCODE data provides a detailed report of the 
initial  integrative  analysis  of  the  epigenomics  data  [47, 
63-66].

At a basic level, the data have revealed epigenomic sig-
natures of a variety of functional elements, thus significantly 
enriching their annotation. For instance, many non-coding 
RNAs  have  been  successfully  annotated  as  a  result  of 
deciphering an epigenomic code specific to their promoters 
and gene bodies [67, 68]. High-throughput profiling of the 
histone  modification  HeK4me1  has  revealed  that  it  is  a

characteristic mark of enhancer elements; this, and other 
correlative  marks  have  enabled  the  discovery  of  tens  of 
thousands of cell-specific enhancers [69, 70] in the human 
genome,  drastically  improving  our  ability  to  probe  the 
mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. In fact, chromatin 
signatures specific to promoters, enhancers, and repressed 
regions,  etc.,  have  all  been  modeled  by  computational 
methods like ChromHMM [42]. Furthermore, by isolating 
footprints of protected DNA present inside blocks of hyper-
sensitive  or  nucleosome-depleted  DNA,  a  comprehensive 
list of potential cis-regulatory binding sites/sequences has 
been identified, despite the lack of specific antibodies or the 
knowledge of cell-specific regulators [2].

Availability  of  epigenomic  data  has  revived  predictive 
modeling of condition-specific gene expression. For exam-
ple, Dong et al. [71] generated a 2-step quantitative model 
that  includes  genome  localization  data  for  11  histone 
modifications and 1 histone variant in 7 human cell lines and 
gene  expression  data  quantified  using  RNA-seq  and  cap 
analysis gene expression (CAGE) in the nuclear and cyto-
solic  compartments of the cell. The  Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient  between  their  predicted  and  measured  ex-
pression levels in about 78 experiments ranged between 0.6 
and 0.9 (median r = 0.83). Natarajan et al. [72] trained a 
classifier  that  associates  cell-specific  TF  sequence  motif 
matches in DHS regions with different expression patterns 
in  19  diverse  cell  types,  thus  predicting  cell-type  specific 
expression  directly  from  regulatory  elements  in  open 
chromatin. 

Prior  to  the  availability  of  NGS,  details  of  the  spatial 
structure  of  chromatin  and  its  correlates,  as  well  as  its 
functional impacts were largely uncharted. Characterization 
of  the  spatial  proximity  of  distal  genomic  elements  with 
3C-derivative assays has revealed a high rate of widespread 
promiscuous interactions among enhancers and promoters. 
For  instance,  more  than  40%  of  promoters  interact  with 
multiple distal sites, and this is likely true for enhancers as 
well [73]. The spatial chromatin interaction data have also 
helped  challenge  some  previously  held  beliefs  that  were 
nevertheless  unsupported.  For  instance,  historically,  the 
DNA-binding protein CTCF was known to function, among 
other  things,  as  an  insulator  that  inhibited  the  spatial 
interaction  between  an  enhancer  and  its  target  promoter 
when  flanking  a  CTCF-bound  locus.  However,  recent  5C 
data  showed  that  almost  60%  of  all  enhancer-promoter 
interactions  happen,  despite  an  intervening  CTCF-bound 
locus [74]. In fact, there is increasing evidence that CTCF, 
along with cohesin is involved in coordinating long-range 
interactions  between  regulatory  elements,  and  that  these 
events  are  reflective  of  cell-type  specific  transcriptional 
programs [75].

With the availability of putative genome-wide enhancers 
along  with  their  cell  type-specific  activity  profile  across 
numerous  cell  types,  it  is  now  possible  to  investigate  an 
alternate layer of transcriptional regulation represented by a 
network of distal enhancers that exhibit correlated activities 
across  cell  types  [76,  77]  and  jointly  underlie  correlated 
expression of functionally linked genes. Such analysis brings 
forth an alternative view of transcriptional regulation, where 
instead of a single gene regulated by one or more regulatory 
elements, one ought to consider the collective of enhancers 
and  genes,  co-localized  in  nuclear  space  to  achieve  co- 
expression of functionally linked genes [78, 79].

Epigenomic  profiling  along  the  developmental  time 
course from ESCs to differentiated cells has shed light on 
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms during early develop-
ment.  For  instance,  comparison  of  the  “histone  code” 
between the two developmental timeframes indicates that 
regions marked by repressive histone marks are generally 
larger  in  differentiated  cells  and  that  these  regions  span 
developmental  genes.  It  was  also  noted  that  the  same 
regions  are  more  accessible  in  ESCs  [80,  81],  thus  sug-
gesting  an  epigenome-mediated  regulation  of  develop-
mental  gene  transcription.  Precisely  how  this  is  accom-
plished is yet to be clarified.

The  epigenomic  data  and  the  discovery  of  significant 
patterns  of  epigenomic  marks  associated  with  specific 
functional  regions  have  also  helped  clarify  genotype- 
phenotype association data. Numerous GWAS have revealed 
several  polymorphic  loci  associated  with  various  diseases 
[82]. However, a mechanistic interpretation of these signals 
has been hampered by  the  fact  that  most of  the  disease- 
associated genetic variants reside in non-coding regions with 
no obvious functional interpretation. By combining epige-
nomic maps and genetic variants, it was found that these 
disease-associated  variants  are  enriched  within  cell  type- 
specific  accessible  (DHS  regions)  and  active  regulatory 
regions [2]. Also, an epigenomic model of cardiac enhancers 
was shown to provide a better causal interpretation of GWAS 
signals associated with heart-related traits [83].

Open Questions and Challenges 

The  slew  of  epigenetic  data  has  revolutionized  our 
perception of the human genome. Although not all “epige-
netically  marked”  regions  of  the  genome  are  likely  to  be 
functional, it is very likely that a large portion is functional―
much more than the 5－10% of the genome that is deemed 
to  evolve  under  purifying  selection  [84,  85].  Analysis  of 
transcriptional and epigenetic data has revealed that almost 
half  of  the  genome  is  involved  in  carrying  out  specific 
biochemical functions [13]. Where these biochemical func-

tions fit in the big picture, and how they are regulated are still 
open questions.

Another fundamental problem is that the causal relation-
ships  among  various  epigenomic  events,  such  as  DNA 
methylation, histone modifications, TF binding, and gene 
expression,  etc.,  are  currently  not  well  understood.  Al-
though correlations between these events have been well 
documented in different contexts, we do not know if one is 
necessary and/or sufficient to observe another.

Before the full potential of NGS in mapping the epige-
nome can be attained, several technical challenges need to be 
overcome. For instance, techniques like ChIP-seq, used for 
profiling  transcription  factor  binding  and  histone  modi-
fications require a large amount of starting material, ranging 
up to 5 million cells. Collection of such a large population of 
primary  differentiated  cells,  progenitors,  and  those  from 
specific  developmental  stages  is  inherently  hard.  Hetero-
geneity of a cell population is another issue that needs to be 
resolved. It is challenging to obtain a homogeneous popu-
lation of cells of a singular type from primary tissues that 
often contain a heterogeneous population of cell types, and it 
is this lack of homogeneity that can adversely impact the 
interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained 
from analyzing the epigenomic data.

Yet,  many  solutions  to  tackle  the  problems  above  are 
underway. First, there is the emergence of techniques－like 
ChIP-nano (nano-scale ChIP), which is a highly sensitive 
small-scale ChIP-seq protocol with a requirement of <50,000 
cells as starting material [86], and single-molecule real-time 
sequencing [87], which aims at alleviating cell-population 
effects during mapping specific features. Second, methods 
that  are  aimed  at  the  targeted  knock-out  of  epigenetic 
modifiers, like DNA methyltransferases and histone modi-
fication enzymes, at predetermined DNA sequences (using 
transcription  activator-like  effector  nucleases  [TALENs]) 
[88],  can  help  to  better  characterize  the  functional  rela-
tionships  between  gene  expression  and  epigenetics,  thus 
providing proof of concept for expression modulation (also 
called  epigenetic  editing  methods)  [89].  Also,  powerful 
statistical approaches are being developed to integrate data 
[42, 90] to resolve some of these fundamental issues. With 
more epigenomic maps being profiled, and more effective 
computational approaches being developed, we are inching 
towards a holistic mechanistic understanding of cellular and 
organismal processes.
