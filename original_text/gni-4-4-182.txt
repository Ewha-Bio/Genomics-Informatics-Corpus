Abstract 
6-Phosphogluconolactonase  (6PGL)  is  one  of the  key 
enzymes  in  the  ubiquitous pathways of central  carbon 
metabolism, but bacterial 6PGL had been long known as 
a missing enzyme even after complete bacterial genome 
sequence information became available. Although recent 
experimental characterization suggests that there are two 
types  of  6PC~Ls (DevB  and  YbhE),  their  phylogenetic 
distribution is severely biased. Here we present that proteins 
in COG group previously described as 3-carboxymuconate 
cyclase (COG2706) are actually the YbhE-type 6PGLs, 
which  are  widely  distributed  in  Proteobacteria  and 
Firmicutes. Tl1is case exemplifies how erroneous functional 
description  of  a  member  in  the  reference  database 
commonly u:sed  in transitive genome annotation cause 
systematic problem in the prediction of genes even with 
universal cellular functions.

In the course of annotation processes of several Firmicutes

nolactonase  (6PGL) are frequently  missing  throughout 
functional  information transfer by homology from public 
amino acid databases, a de facto annotation strategy for 
completely  sequenced  genomes.  6PGL  (EC  3.1.1.31 ), 
catalyzing the hydrolysis of o-6-phosphogluconolactone 
into 6-phosphogluconate, plays a key role in the oxidative 
branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. Since this path-

way provides major biosynthetic capacity as one of central 
carbon metabolism, life without functional pentose phos(cid:173)
phate pathway is considered to be impossible. Cardwell 
reviewed  several  "missing" enzymes from  genome se(cid:173)
quence data that were expected to exist as members of 
well-studied biochemical pathways and indicated that no 
gene corresponding to 6PGL had been identified until that 
time (Cardwell, 1999). Lack of enzymes catalyzing major 
metabolic reactions is sometimes indicative of the pres(cid:173)
ence of alternative pathway, but it is often the case that in(cid:173)
correct gene assignment in genome database and its prop(cid:173)
agation misleads accurate prediction of essential genes 
(Brenner, 1999; Devos ahd Valencia, 2001 ). These intrigu(cid:173)
ing observations led us to study current knowledge of the 
functional assignment of bacterial 6PGL.. In this paper, we 
investigated  why  genes  encoding  6PGL  are  under(cid:173)
represented in bacterial genomes, and tried to elucidate 
structural and familial  relationship in 6PGL proteins. 

Two protein families in bac1teriai6PGLs 
Genes encoding 6PGL was first characterized from human 
eDNA (6PGL_HUMAN) (Collard eta/., 1999). This protein 
is homologous to bacterial devB gene product that is often 
found  in  proximity  to  the  gene  encoding  glucose-6-
phosphate  dehydrogenase  (zwf)  and  is  also  related  to 
glucosamine-6-phosphate  deaminase  (EC  3.5.99.6,  a 
synonym  with  glucosamine-6-phosphate  isomerase). 
They expressed  the  eDNA clone  in  E.  coli system  and 
showed its 6-phosphogluconolactonase activity. Furtherrrore, 
they also suggested that bacterial devB gene product is 
most likely 6PGL. 

The latter assumption was proved later by characterizing 
devB homolog in Pseudorronas aeruginosa (6PGL_PSEAE) 
(Hager eta/., 2000). When they BLAST searched against 
NCBI database using 6PGL_PSEAE as a query sequence, 
a large number of related proteins previously identified as 
DevB or SOL homologs were found. Multiple alignments of 
DevB  family  proteins  constitute  a  HMM  designated  as 
TIGR01198 in TIGRFAMs database (IPR005900 in lnterPro 
database) (Haft eta/., 2003; Mulder eta/., 2005). However, 
this family does not represent entire 6PGL proteins from the 
bacterial  kingdom,  since it does not cover members from 
virtually all Firmicutes and enteric bactelia such as E.  coli. 

The COG database has one orthologous cluster related to 
DevB-type 6PGL (COG0363), but it also includes related but 
functionally  diverged  protein  such  as  glucosamine-6-
phosphate deaminase (Tatusov eta/., 2003). 

It was not until very recently that ybhE was assigned 
to be the gene encoding 6PGL in E.  coli by two independent 
research groups, although the locus was mapped at 17.2 
min  more  than  30  years  ago  with  unknown  function 
(Thomason eta/., 2004; Zimenkov eta/., 2005). 6PGL in 
E.  coli is totally unrelated from DevB-type enzyme. This 
is a good example of non-orthologous gene displacement, 
in which unrelated (or distantly related) enzymes catalyzes 
the equivalent biochemical reaction (Galperin and Koonin, 
1998).  Among  the  260  proteins  described  as  6PGLs 
proteins in current UniProt KnowledgeBase Release 9.3 
(Wu eta/., 2006), 196 entries are found to be members of 
TIGR01198 (true DevB family). 

COG2706 (3-carboxymuconate cyclase) 
and6PGL 
YbhE  protein  belongs  to  both  COG2706  (16  members, 
3-carboxymuconate  cyclase)  and  MF _01605  HAMAP 
family ( 17 members, 6PGL)(Gattiker et at., 2003). Because 
COG clustering is based on similarity with a less stringent 
cutoff, some COGs may contain ortholgous proteins with 
diverged, heterogeneous functions as shown in COG0363 
mentioned above. This apparent discrepancy of functional 
descriptions on a single protein can be thus elucidated by 
assuming that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase and 6PGL were 
so similar that they were classified into a single COG group. 
This sounds  plausible,  since there were  no  members of 
COG2706  proved  to  be  6PGL  either  by  experiment  or 
sequence analysis when COG database was built. 

3-carboxymuconate cyclase (carboxy-cis, cis-muconate 
cyclase or 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase, EC 5.5.1.5) 
catalyzes  the  interconversion  between  3-carboxy- cis, 
cis-muconate  and  3-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-
acetate. This reaction constitutes the [3-ketoadipate pathway 
in  some  microorganisms,  which  is  responsible  for  the 
catabolism of aromatic compounds such as protocatechuate 
and  catechol  into TCA cycle  intermediates.  At  present, 
3-carboxymuconate cyclase is  characterized  only from 
eukaryotic microorganism (CMLE_NEUCR) (Mazur et at., 
1994 ). The same substrate can be lactonized to a similar 
compound, 2-carboxy-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate 
by the  prokaryotic enzyme  3-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate 
cycloisomerase (EC 5.5.1.2) (Lorite eta/., 1998; Murakami 
et at.,  2004).  These  two  enzymes,  collectively  called 
CMLEs (3-carboxymuconate lactonizing enzymes),  are 
not related to each other in spite of their common substrate. 

Finding Missing Enzyme Caused by Error in Database  183 

Erroneous  functional  description  of 
COG2706 
Is 3-carboxymuconate cyclase best describing COG2706? 
Interestingly, none of the 16 original members constituting 
COG2706  were  characterized  as  3-carboxymuconate 
cyclase (see Table 1 ).  On the other hand, six of them are 
true 6PGLs and also belong to MF _ 01605. Because the only 3-
carboxymuoonate cyclase ever characterized (CMLE _ NEUCR) 
was not included in the 66 oompletely sequenced genomes 
for COG construction, function of COG2706 might have 
been  assigned  according  to  their  overall  sequence 
similarity to CMLE_NEUCR. When CMLE_NEUCR was 
subjected  to  BLAST  search  against  COG  database, 
however, similarities to COG2706 members were too low. 
For example, BS__ykgB (Bacillus subtilis) in COG database 
is the best hit for CMLE _ NEUCR, but the BLASTP bit score 
is  only  54.  This  observation  indicates  that  assigning 
3-carboxymuconate cyclase to COG2706 is inappropriate 
since it was based on weak sequence similarity. We also 
suggest that description of COG2706 should be changed 
into 6PGL since one member (YbhE in E.  colt) ofthis cluster 
already  has  characterized  biochemical 
functions. 
Association of EC 3.1.1.31 to COG2706 in KEGG Ortholgy 
definition file also supports our findings regarding this COG 
cluster (Kanehisa et at., 2006). As mentioned above, this 
error might have been inevitable because no member of 
COG2706  was  described  as  6PGL  when  COGs  were 
constructed.  Once  such  errors  occur  in  the  reference 
genome database, they tend to be propagated by rather 
careless transitive annotation, and what is worse, they are 
seldom  corrected.  If  prokaryotic  protein  database  is 
searched with E. coli YbhE protein as a query, we can easily 
find  strong  positive  hits  throughout  whole  prokaryotic 
classes  except for archaeal  groups.  Several  hits  have 
6PGL as their names, but most of them are given either 
hypothetical protein or 3-carboxymuconate cyclase. Lack 
of 6PGL  in  Firmicutes  thus  results  from  misnomer  of 
genuine 6PGL enzymes. A recent report suggested that 
Bfl341  protein  from  8/ochmannia  floridanus  formerly 
classified  into  COG2706  should  be  6PGL  due  to  its 
sequence similarity with  E.  coli YbhE,  but they did  not 
explore the possibility of inaccurate functional description 
given to COG2706 (Gaudermann eta/., 2006)

Table  1 summarizes the basic properties of 27 proteins 
belonging either to COG2706 or to MF _01695. They are

family, as only five proteins (BU293, Ecs0795, STM0785, 
ybhE, and YP01149) found common in both groups. But 
this observation is feasible since clustering strategies are 
entirely different for two protein family database. When we 
scanned  16  COG2706  sequences  against  the  entire 
HAMAP families,  most of them  matched  MF _01695 at 
different scam levels. Furthermore, 16 COG2706 proteins 
also constitute a PSSM-based family in  CDD database 
(Marchler-Bauer  et  a/.,  2005).  These  imply  the  two 
independently  built  protein  families  are  essentially the 
same  such  that  they  can  be  given  a  single  functional 
description. 

Phylogene~tic tree of the 27 proteins  constructed  by 
neighbor-joining method showed members belonging to 
COG group only tend to form a somewhat distant subgroup. 
Among  them,  Ralstonia  solanacearum  (two  proteins), 
Pseudomonas  aeruginosa,  and  Schizosaccharomyces 
pombe have EiPGL of aforementioned DevB family. These 
species  may be  currently  undergoing  non-orthologous 
gene displacement. We are not going to investigate this 

phenomenon here, as detailed analysis would go beyond 
the scope of this report. 

Consequence of errors in the reference 
databases 
COG is one of the major reference databases commonly 
used  in  microbial  genome  annotation.  The  utility  of 
COG-based annotation is that it could increase the number 
of functional assignment with a newly sequenced genome 
because a single functional description can be given to all 
members  of a  COG  cluster  rather  reliably  even  if the 
individual member was not yet assigned function (Natale 
eta/., 2000), and its functional classification category is 
very widely used in bacterial genomics study. The most 
highly annotated  protein database such  as Swiss-Prot, 
which is the first choice for transitive annotation, contains 
6PGLs mostly from DevB family. If a newly found YbhE-type 
6PGL from  bacterial  phylum other than  Proteobacteria 
was processed,  it would not get any functional clues.  In 

Finding Missing Enzyme Caused by Error in  Database  185 

most cases, COG-based annotation is the next measure 
to taken when pairwise search against a protein database 
does not give discemable functional predictions. Erroneous 
annotation is resulted from adopting functional descriptions 
that are associated with the matched COG at this step. To 
make the matter worse, protein data set such as NCBI-NR 
or UniProt/TrEMBL,  the last resource  utilized when  no 
functional information was obtained through the previous 
search against databases with higher accuracy, already 
contains probable YbhE-type 6PGL that named after the 
description of COG2706, 3-carboxymuconate cyclase.  For 
example,  98.9%  of  553  bacterial  3-carboxymuconate 
cyclase found in NCBI-NR dataset (as of Dec 2006) was 

named after their COG affiliation. 

Although this kind of errors can be corrected to some 
extent in the secondary (or 'derived') protein databases, 
its  effect  is  minimal.  For  example,  31  proteins  in 
YbhE-type  6PGL in  KEGG  Orthology  category  do  not 
fully  cover  this  type  of  proteins  in  prokaryotes.  This 
means  that  once  the  original  description  other  than 
'(conservative) hypothetical protein' was given, it seems 
very  reluctant  to  correct  it  no  matter  how  correct  the 
information might be. 

In conclusion, we compiled briefly present knowledge 
on prokaryotic 6PGL with regard to genome annotation, 
and showed that one specific case of missing enzyme was

caused by wrongly assigned functional information in the 
reference database. Considering that 6PGL was brought 
into focus due to its indispensability in cellular metabolism, 
it is obvious that there must be more erroneous functional 
assignments  yet  undiscovered.  To  help eliminate error 
propagation during genome annotation, we should be sure 
of the authenticity of original functional assignment on the 
reference  s13quence.  This  is  important not only for the 
accuracy of our data, but also for avoiding propagation of 
errors into the scientific community.
