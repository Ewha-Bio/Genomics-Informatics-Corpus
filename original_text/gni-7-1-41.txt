Abstract

The  Korean  Agricultural  Culture  Collection  (KACC)  has 
developed  a  web-based  system  to  provide  an  integrated 
database  with 
information  updates  about  microbial 
resources.  This  integrated  database  consists  of  5  major 
functions  and  contains  general  information,  which  in-
cludes  identification  numbers,  culture  media  composi-
tion,  image  information,  DNA  sequences,  patent  in-
formation,  and  general  forms  for  ordering  and  depositing 
microorganisms.  In  2008,  KACC  started  providing  char-
acterization  information.  KACC  maintains  9,801  cultures 
of  microorganisms,  including  3,296  strains  of  bacteria, 
4,734  fungi,  784  actinomycetes,  64  yeasts,  and  923 
others.

Keywords:  KACC,  microbial  resource,  integrated  data-
base,  microorganism  information

Introduction

Microbial  resources  are  closely  associated  with  our  daily 
life,  and  their  collection  and  utilization  are  very  im-
portant.  In  terms  of  microbial  resources,  the  value  of  a 
microorganism  database  depends  on  the  amount,  qual-
ity,  and  accuracy  of  the  information  that  it  contains. 
Microbial  databases  have  been  developed  in  various 
fields,  including  the  IMG  2.3  (Victor  et  al.,  2008), 
NMPDR  (McNeil  et al.,  2007),  and  MBGD  databases 
(Uchiyama et al.,  2007).  In  line  with  the  increase  in  the 
number  of  databases  for  microbial  resources,  various  in-
tegrated  web  service  systems  have  been  constructed. 
BCCMTM  (http://bccm.belspo.be/)  consists  of  4  comple-
mentary  research-based  service  culture  collections.  This 
database  maintains  over  53,500  well-documented  and

authenticated  strains  of  bacteria,  filamentous  and  yeast 
fungi,  over  950  plasmids,  and  18  DNA  libraries.  KCTC 
(http://kctc.kribb.re.kr/)  has  a  wide  and  systematic  col-
lection  of  materials  that  comprise  microorganisms,  ani-
mal  and  plant  cell  lines,  and  patent  strains  from  domes-
tic  and  international  sources.  UKNCC  (http://www.ukncc. 
co.uk/)  offers  identification  by  a  range  of  techniques  for 
many  organisms,  including  actinomycetes,  algae,  animal 
cells,  arthropods,  bacteria,  filamentous  fungi,  nemat-
odes,  protozoa,  mycoplasma,  and  yeast.  JCM  (http:// 
www.jcm.riken.go.jp/)  supplies  authentic  microorganisms 
to  researchers  in  the  fields  of  life  sciences  and  bio-
technology.  JCM  preserves  6,600  strains  of  bacteria,  in-
cluding  actinomycetes,  280  strains  of  archaea,  and 
4,000  strains  of  fungi,  including  yeast. 
    In  Korea,  the  Korean  Agricultural  Culture  Collection 
(KACC,  http://kacc.rda.go.kr/)  serves  as  an  authorized 
organizer  and  the  official  depository  (NIAB,  2008)  of  mi-
crobial  resources.  KACC  maintains  microbial  resources, 
including  bacteria,  actinomycetes,  yeast,  and  filament-
ous  fungi,  and  has  developed  a  database  of  microbial 
resources  (Chang et al.,  2009).  In  order  to  collect  micro-
bial  resources  from  international  centers,  KACC  joined 
the  World  Federation  for  Culture  Collection  (WFCC),  the 
World  Data  Center  for  Microorganism  (WDCM),  and  the 
Asian  Consortium  for  the  Conservation  and  Sustainable 
Use  of  Microbial  Resources  (ACM).  In  2008,  KACC  de-
veloped  a  web-based  system  to  provide  an  integrated 
database,  which  contains  updated  information  on  micro-
bial  resources. 

Methodology

Dataset

The  database  information  was  collected  from  the  micro-
organism  project  (http://kacc.rda.go.kr/),  the  National 
Agrobiodiversity  Center  (NAC,  http://genebank.rda.go.kr/), 
the  National  Academy  of  Agricultural  Science  (NAAS, 
http://www.niast.go.kr/),  the  Bio-Green  21  project  (http:// 
biogreen21.rda.go.kr/),  relevant  microorganism  divisions 
of  universities,  and  various  institutes  in  Korea.  In  most 
instances,  the  strains  were  isolated  from  Korean  agricul-
tural  environments,  but  some  strains  were  shared  with 
other  culture  collections.  In  addition,  the  database  in-
formation  was  accumulated  and  maintained  through 
several  collaborating  international  institutes,  such  as  the 
Centraalbureau  voor  Schimmelcultures  (CBS,  http://www. 

42    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(1)  41-45,  March  2009

cbs.knaw.nl/)  in  the  Netherlands,  ARS  culture  collection 
(NRRL,  http://nrrl.ncaur.usda.gov/)  in  the  USA,  and  the 
Deutsche  Smmlung  von  Microorganismen  und  Zellkultu-
ren  GembH  (DSMZ,  http://www.dsmz.de/)  in  Germany.

lowed  the  standard  principles  of  relational  databases 
using  by  ERWin  Data  Modeler  software  (http://www. 
ca.com),  and  the  data  were  distributed  into  numerous 
tables  to  establish  the  hierarchical  relationships  (Chang 
et al.,  2008)  between  or  among  the  datasets. 

Database  design

The  integrated  database  is  designed  to  provide  in-
formation  on  Korean  microbial  resources  with  a  bio-da-
tabase  management  system  (Tae  et al.,  2008).  The 
Entity  Relation  Diagram  (ERD)  of  the  database  is  shown 
in  Fig.  1.  The  schema  consists  of  4  major  functional 
categories.  In  the  first  category,  a  general  character-
ization  table  shows  the  identification  of  microorganisms 
by  TCSP_INFO  table.  The  MGDTD  table  shows  the 
process  of  registration  for  microorganisms,  including 
Korean  viruses,  fungi,  and  others.  The  operating  table 
and  management  table  show  the  ordering  and  manage-
ment  process  for  microorganisms,  patent  strains,  and 
gene  clones.  Using  the  collected  information,  a  micro-
bial  resources  database  system  was  developed.  The 
platform  was  developed  using  MYSQL  and  JAVA  lan-
guages,  and 
in  an  Oracle 
Relational  Database  Management  System  (RDBMS).  The 
logical  and  the  physical  schema  of  the  database  fol-

the  data  were  stored 

Database  contents

The  integrated  database  now  maintains  9801  cultures  of 
microorganisms, 
including  3296  strains  of  bacteria, 
4,734  fungi,  784  actinomycetes,  64  yeasts,  and  923  oth-
ers  (mushrooms,  gene  clones,  etc.).  In  2008,  a  total  of 
1,855  strains  of  new  microbial  resources  were  regis-
tered,  including  616  isolates  of  bacteria,  950  isolates  of 
fungus  (including  Basidomycetes),  and  289  actinomy-
cetes.  In  most  instances,  microorganisms  are  industrial 
bacteria,  such  as  Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and  Burkhol-
deria. The  database  contains  rare  fungi,  such  as Cero-
cospora, Septoria, and  Ramularia. Table  1  shows  the 
number  of  registered  microbial  resources  by  year.

Implementation  and  features

The  integrated  database  provides  various  information, 
including  text  record,  morphological  images,  and  DNA

tity,  implemented  as  a  database  table.  Lines  between  entities  indicate  that  relationships  exist. 

sequence  data.  The  database  platforms  consist  of  5 
major  functions:  microorganism  search,  ordering,  depos-
it,  patent  microorganism  management,  and  gene  clone 
management.
    The  search  function  can  perform  searches  by  type  of 
strain,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  searching  of  micro-
organisms  by  genus  and  species  can  be  done  using  2 
methods:  1.  A  keyword  search  (Fig.  2A)  by  which  users 
can  search  using  partial  or  complete  species  names 
from  2  classifications  or  6  categories;  to  choose  a  spe-
cific  menu  for  classification  and  categories,  users  may 
specify  one  submenu  from  the  pull-down  menu.  2. 
Alphabetical  order  searches  (Fig.  2B)  in  which  the  in-
formation  tables  of  strains  are  alphabetically  arranged 
according  to  the  scientific  names.  Users  may  search  for 
specific  data  by  combining  search  parameters  and  can 
search  linked  information  by  using  different  search  win-
dows,  such  as  gene  clone  (Fig.  2C)  and  media  search

    Screenshots  of  results  pages  from  various  search 
methods  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  In  the  information  table  of 
specific  microorganisms,  users  can  access  an  image  in-
formation  table  by  clicking  the  thumbnail  image  on  the 
right  (Fig.  3A).  A  detailed  image  table  provides  in-
formation  that  consists  of  title,  identification  number, 
scientific  name,  accession  number,  definition,  descrip-
tion,  image  number,  authors,  institute,  and  memo  record 
(Fig.  3B).  By  clicking  a  linked  ‘Media’  field,  users  can 
access  the  information  tables  that  contain  individual  me-
dia  composition  data.  The  media  tables  provide  in-
formation  on  the  media  for  growing  the  microorganisms 
(Fig.  3C).  A  user  can  acquire  a  specific  strain  by  clicking 
on  the  linked  ‘Strain  Order’  object,  which  will  then 
download  an  order  form  (Fig.  3D).
    When  using  the  keyword  or  alphabetical  search,  users 
can  query  different  identification  names  or  historical 
classification  fields  by  using  the  hierarchical  tree  web 
form.  The  query  results  are  linked  to  each  detailed  table 
through  their  respective  strain  lists.  The  user  can  then 
view  an  elements  report  page,  and  it  is  possible  to 
download  the  detailed  information,  including  the  specific 
DNA  sequence  and  image  information.  Users  can  also 
access  a  page  that  contains  individual  plant  disease  in-
formation  that  is  related  to  a  specific  microorganism  by 
clicking  the  ‘Search  for  plant  disease  list  in  Korea’  link. 
This  table  provides  information  on  the  ‘List  of  Plant 
Diseases  in  Korea,’  including  descriptions  of  all  related 
pathogens  and  annotations  from  the  Korean  Society  of 
Plant  Pathology  (KSPP,  http://www.kspp.org/).

    In  addition,  KACC  provides  a  function  for  the  ordering 
and  depositing  of  microorganisms,  including  patent  mi-
croorganisms  or  gene  clones.  Anyone  with  the  basic 
knowledge  and  the  facilities  for  culturing  may  order  and 
deposit  microorganisms.  However,  orders  for  personal 
purposes  may  not  be  accommodated.  A  user  can  order 
a  strain  in  3  steps:  (i)  search  for  a  strain  from  the  data-
base;  (ii)  fill-in  the  order  form,  including  the  ‘Materials 
Transfer  Agreement;’  and  (iii)  send  the  request  form  by 
postal  mail  or  email.  The  patent  menu  has  3  major  func-
tions,  such  as  those  related  to  ordering,  depositing,  and 
regulations.  Users  can  view  different  classification  tables 
or  specific  forms  by  using  the  corresponding  web  forms. 

Discussion

KACC  classifies  and  preserves  diverse  Korean  microbial 
resources  including  bacteria,  yeasts,  filamentous  fungi, 
and  mushrooms  and  provides  an  integrated  database.

This  integrated  database  contains  general  information, 
such  as  identification  numbers,  culture  media  composi-
tion,  image  information,  DNA  sequence,  and  general 
forms  for  ordering  and  depositing  microorganisms.  In 
2008,  KACC,  which  maintains  9,801  cultures  of  micro-
organisms,  started  providing  characterization  informa-
tion.  With  this,  the  number  of  isolates  that  were  dis-
tributed  to  researchers  who  are  involved  in  micro-
organism-related  industries  increased  to  more  than 
2,100  in  2008  (Table  2).
