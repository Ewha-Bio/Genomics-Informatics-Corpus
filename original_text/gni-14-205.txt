Interleukin-10 (IL10) plays an important role in initiating and maintaining an appropriate immune response to non-Hodgkin 

lymphoma (NHL). Previous studies have revealed that the transcription of IL10 mRNA and its protein expression may be inﬂ

uenced by several single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter and intron regions, including rs1800896, rs1800871, 
and rs1800872. However, the impact of polymorphisms of the IL10 gene on NHL prognosis has not been fully elucidated. 
Here, we investigated the association between IL10 polymorphisms and NHL prognosis. This study involved 112 NHL patients 
treated at the National Cancer Center, Korea. The median age was 57 years, and 70 patients (62.5%) were men. Clinical 
characteristics,  including  age,  performance  status,  stage,  and  extra-nodal  involvement,  as  well  as  cell  lineage  and 
International Prognostic Index (IPI), were evaluated. A total of four polymorphisms in IL10 with heterozygous alleles were 
analyzed  for  hazard  ratios  of  overall  survival  (OS)  and  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  using  Cox  proportional  hazards 
regression  analysis.  Diffuse  large  B-cell  lymphoma  was  the  most  common  histologic  type  (n  =  83),  followed  by  T-cell 
lymphoma (n = 18), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 6), and others (n = 5). Cell lineage, IPI, and extra-nodal involvement were 
predictors of prognosis. In the additive genetic model results for each IL10 polymorphism, the rs1800871 and rs1800872 
polymorphisms represented a marginal association with OS (p = 0.09 and p = 0.06) and PFS (p = 0.05 and p = 0.08) in B-cell 
lymphoma patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These 
findings suggest that IL10 polymorphisms might be prognostic indicators for patients with B-cell NHL treated with R-CHOP.

Introduction

The  incidence  rate  of  hematologic  malignancies  has 
steadily increased during recent decades in many regions. 
Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  (NHL)  is  the  most  frequent 
hematologic cancer type, accounting for 43% of all hema-
tologic malignancies and 90% of lymphomas [1]. In Korea, 
the  incidence  of  NHL  is  approximately  10.8  per  100,000 
persons per year [2]. The risk of NHL is increased by age, 

chronic infection, and genetic and environmental factors [3].
The frequency of B-cell lymphoma is higher than that of 
T-cell  lymphoma  in  NHL,  and  the  survival  rate  of  B-cell 
lymphoma  has  continuously  improved.  The  prognosis 
varies, depending on patient age, clinicopathological features, 
and genetic factors. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) 
is the most commonly used tool to predict the prognosis of 
NHL [4, 5]. However, its efficiency could be enhanced by the 
inclusion of additional prognostic markers.

cytokines, is mainly secreted by type 2 helper T-cells (Th2) 
and  activates  T-cells  and  monocytes,  as  well  as  B  lym-
phocytes. IL-10 can promote cancer by immunosuppression 
or stimulation of cell proliferation (B-cells and Th2-cells) 
and  plays  an  important  role  in  the  regulation  of  inﬂ-
ammation by suppressing the release and function of Th1 
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines [6]. Recent evidence suggests 
that  the  imbalance  of  the  Th1/Th2  response  induced  by 
genetic variants affects the pathogenesis of NHL [7]. These 
ﬁndings indicate that IL10 polymorphism may be a principal 
mediator cytokine in the pathogenesis of NHL.
The  IL10  gene  is  positioned  on  chromosome  1  (1q31–
1q32). Previous studies have revealed that the transcription 
of IL10 mRNA and its protein expression may be inﬂuenced 
by  some  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  the 
promoter  region,  including  rs1800896,  rs1800871,  and 
rs1800872 [7, 8].

However, the impact of polymorphisms of the IL10 gene 
on NHL prognosis has not been fully elucidated. Here, we 
investigated the association between IL10 polymorphisms 
and NHL prognosis.

Methods
Patients and collection of clinical data 

This study recruited 112 patients diagnosed with NHL at 
the National Cancer Center in Korea from 2005 to 2012. 
Patients gave informed consent, which was approved by the 
institutional review board. Inclusion criteria were as follows: 
(1) ethnically Korean; (2) available samples at diagnosis; and 
(3) diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the basis of 
World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines [9], with or 
without treatment with an rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin,  vincristine,  and  prednisolone  (R-CHOP)  re-
gimen. There were no recruitment restrictions with regard to 
gender or cancer stage. The mean age of patients was 56 
years, and 62.5% of cases were male. 

Chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 
six to eight cycles, as decided by the clinician. After every 
three  cycles,  the  therapeutic  response  was  evaluated. 
Follow-up  was  performed  every  3  months  for  the  first  2 
years;  thereafter,  the  interval  was  extended  to  every  6 
months.  Information  on  demographic  characteristics,  in-
cluding age, IPI, performance status by WHO, cancer stage, 
and extra-nodal involvement, were evaluated and analyzed. 

Candidate polymorphisms and genotyping

Five polymorphism sites were selected, based on a review 
of the literature and a genetic database. We searched the 
literature  using  the  keywords  ‘IL-10,  polymorphism,  and 
cancer’ in 3 years and decided to include five SNPs (rs1800896, 

rs1800871, rs1800872, rs3021094, and rs1554286), which 
are located in the promotor and intron regions of the IL-10 
gene. These SNPs have been reported as having a significant 
association with cancer more than once out of 45 publica-
tions.  Among  them,  rs1800896  was  excluded  from  the 
analysis,  because  its  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  was 
0.027.  Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  patients’  peri-
pheral blood using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, 
Valencia,  CA,  USA),  and  SNPs  were  genotyped  using  a 
Taqman  5'  nuclease  assay  for  allelic  discrimination  with 
commercially available Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster  City,  CA,  USA),  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions. Briefly, genotyping reactions were carried out 
in a volume of 5 μL, containing 10 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 
μL of TaqMan Genotyping Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 
and  genotyping  probe,  in  a  384-well  plate.  Genotyping 
results  were  analyzed  with  an  ABI  7900HT  Sequence 
Detection System (Applied Biosystems) by applying allelic 
discrimination plots using SDS 2.1 software (version 5.0; 
Applied Biosystems). Genotyping results were confirmed by 
independently replicating genotyping reactions for 10% of 
the samples, and all genotypes were the same.

Statistical analyses

Associations between clinicopathological factors, including 
age,  IPI,  performance  status  by  WHO,  cancer  stage,  and 
extra-nodal involvement, and patients’ survival were anal-
yzed  using  univariable  or  multivariable  Cox  proportional 
hazards regression models. 

All polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, 
with p-values greater than 0.05 using HWE.test in R package 
{genetics} [10]. 
Three different genetic models—additive, dominant, and 
recessive—were  used  to  assess  each  SNP’s  effect  on  the 
hazard ratios (HRs) for survival. Overall survival (OS) was 
calculated  from  the  day  of  diagnosis  to  the  day  of  last 
follow-up  or  death.  Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  was 
measured from the day of diagnosis to the day of progression 
or death. Patients who were alive at the time of follow-up 
were  censored.  The  effects  of  SNPs  on  OS  or  PFS  were 
presented as HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 
total patient dataset was used for the analysis. The same 
analysis  was  repeated  using  the  diffuse  large  B-cell  lym-
phoma (DLBCL) patients treated by R-CHOP. All reported 
p-values  are  two-sided,  and  statistical  analyses  were 
performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC, USA).

Results
Clinical characteristics of NHL patients and 
treatment outcomes 

The associations between clinical characteristics and OS 
or PFS are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The most common 
histologic type was DLBCL (n = 83); others included T-cell 
lymphoma (n = 18), mantle cell lymphoma (n = 6), and 
others  (n  =  5).  Univariable  results  showed  age,  gender, 
performance  status,  extra-nodal  involvement,  and  IPI  as 
being significantly associated with OS and PFS in the total 
patient dataset, with p-values less than 0.05. Variables that 
were significant in the univariable results were used in the 
multivariable analysis. Using the backward variable selection 
method  in  the  multivariable  model,  male,  performance 
status 2, and extra-nodal involvement were highly associa-
ted with a poor prognosis for OS and PFS equally. In addition, 
age was also significantly associated with PFS. A subgroup 

analysis using DLBCL patients treated by R-CHOP showed a 
similar trend, except for age and performance status, as the 
multivariable result for PFS. 

IL10 polymorphisms and survival

Genotype frequencies of four SNPs in the IL10 gene are 
listed in Tables 3 and 4. The MAF of rs1800872 was the 
highest among the four SNPs. 

Of the four polymorphisms, rs1800871 and rs1800872 of 
the IL10 gene represented a marginal association with both 
OS (p = 0.094 and p = 0.058) and PFS (p = 0.051 and p = 
0.077) (Tables 3 and 4) in B-cell lymphoma patients treated 
by R-CHOP, based on additive models. Using an additive 
model for the reference allele, the HR for rs1800871 was 
0.64 times for OS (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.08) and 0.60 times for 
PFS (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) as one minor allele increases in 
B-cell lymphoma patients treated with an R-CHOP regimen 
(Tables 3 and 4).

Discussion

This study showed that rs1800871 and rs1800872 of IL10 
were  marginally  associated  with  the  prognosis  in  NHL. 
Especially  among  the  subtypes  of  NHL,  these  two  poly-
morphisms had a decreased risk with the minor allele for 
DLBCL.  It  suggests  that  IL10  polymorphisms  might  be 
prognostic indicators for such patients.

There  have  been  many  reports  on  the  relationship 
between  IL10  gene  polymorphisms  and  the  risk  of  lym-
phoma,  including  meta-analyses.  These  studies  reported 
that IL10 (rs1800890, rs1800896, rs1800871, and rs1800872) 
polymorphisms are associated with the risk of NHL.

These polymorphisms had a significantly increased risk 
for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma [11, 12]. These results 
showed  the  opposite  effects  compared  with  our  study. 
However, all of the polymorphisms were not associated with 
the risk of NHL. In another study, the rs1800896 reference 
allele was associated with an increased risk of NHL. On the 
other hand, rs1800871 and rs1800872 had no association 
with the risk of NHL [13]. 

For  an  association  with  clinical  outcomes,  a  previous 
study reported that IL10 gene polymorphisms influenced OS 
in  T-cell  lymphoma  NHL  [14].  In  another  study,  IL10 
genotypes  were  associated  with  a  lower  production  of 
anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines as a factor influencing an 
unfavorable course of NHL [15]. However, the other study 

showed  no  difference  of  allele  frequencies  between  lym-
phoma patients and healthy controls, and moreover, they did 
not show any association of OS or event-free survival with 
IL10 genotypes [16]. 

Our study has several limitations. Our study has a limited 
number of patients. Furthermore, these subtypes, such as 
mantle  cell  lymphoma  and  T-cell  lymphoma,  were  not 
common, and fewer studies reported an association between 
IL10 gene polymorphisms and  these subtypes. Therefore, 
the sample size was limited, and the statistical power may be 
insufficient. 

Although our study has a limited number of patients, it 
gave us implications for the association of IL10 genotypes 
and the prognosis of B-cell lymphoma treated by R-CHOP, 
which is a standard therapy. Thus, we need to further study 
this on a large scale to confirm these results.
