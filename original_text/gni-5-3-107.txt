Abstract 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to negatively control pro(cid:173)
tein-coding genes by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) 
in the cytoplasm. In innate immunity, the role of miRNA gene 
silencing is largely unknown. In this study, we performed 
microarray-based experiments using lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-stimulated  macrophages  derived  from  wild-type, 
My088 knockout (KO), TRIF KO, and MyD88!fRIF double 
KO mice. We employed a statistical approach to determine 
the importance of the commonality and specificity of miRNA 
binding  sites  among  groups of temporally  co-regulated 
genes. We demonstrate that both commonality and specif(cid:173)
icity are  irrelevant to define a priori groups of co-down(cid:173)
regulated  genes.  In  addition,  analyzing  the  various  ex(cid:173)
perimental conditions, we suggest that miRNA regulation 
may not only be a late-phase process (after transcription) 
but can also occur even early ( 1 h) after stimulation in knock(cid:173)
out conditions. This further indicates the existence of dy(cid:173)
namic interactions between miRNA and signaling mole(cid:173)
cules/transcription factor regulation; this is another proof 
for the need of shifting from a 'hard-wired' paradigm of gene 
regulation to a dynamical one in which the gene co-regu(cid:173)
lation is established on a case-by-case basis.

Introduction 
Recognition  of  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  by  Toll-like 
receptor  (TLR)  4  of  macrophages  triggers  the  innate 
immune response by activating transcription factors such 
as  NF-kB  and  AP-I,  resulting  in  the  induction  of large 
numbers  of  genes,  predominantly  those  that  encode 
proinflammatory cytokines (Hirotani eta/., 2005). Although 
transcriptional activation and  resultant gene expression 
studies  have  been  performed  in  the  innate  immune 
system, the discovery of microRNAs (miRNA) adds a layer 
of complexity for the understanding of overall  biological 
regulation. 

miRNA  are  approximately  20-25-nucleotide,  small 
RNAs that bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of 
messenger RNA  (mRNA)  in  the  cytoplasm,  and  either 
negatively regulate the expression of the mRNA or repress 
translation into the corresponding protein (Bartel, 2004 ). 
Extensive studies on  miRNAs during the last few years 
(Lai, 2002; Bagga et a/.,2005; Lim, 2005; Baskerville eta/., 
2005; Taganov eta/., 2006; Sood eta/., 2006) have made 
possible the discovery of hundreds of miRNAs. This has 
resulted in the development of databases of miRNA target 
predictions  in  3'-UTR  regions  of mRNAs  (Lewis  eta/., 
2003;  Lai, 2004; Krek eta/., 2005; Bentwich eta/., 2005; 
GrUn  et  a/.,  2005;  Rajewsky,  2006),  facilitating  high(cid:173)
throughput analysis, such as the design of gene regulatory 
networks in terms of shared miRNAs (Shalgi eta/., 2007; 
Tsang eta/., 2007). 

One  of the  chief goals  in  analyzing  innate  immune 
signaling is to discover co-regulated genes using mRNA 
expression data. It has been mostly assumed that similar 
patterns in temporal  mRNA expression  profiles usually 
suggest possessing common transcription factors (Yeo et 
a/.,  2007). We performed a similar analysis on the basis 
of post-transcriptional miRNA regulation of co-regulated 
genes. If miRNA-based regulation has a major role in the 
establishment of gene regulatory circuits, we expect the 
temporally co-regulated genes to share a higher proportion 
of common miRNA binding sites than we would expect by 
chance. To test this hypothesis, we focused on the temporal 
mRNA expression profiles of wild-type macrophages during 
LPS stimulation, paying particular attention to the profiles 
of downregulated genes, since miRNAs negatively regulate

Fig. 1. The three profiles used to define downregulated genes_ 
This  classification  allows  us  to  distinguish  various  dynamic 
downregulation  profiles  by  miRNAs.  Classification  is  done 
according to time after stimulation; 1) 0-1  h is considered early 
downregulation  profile  (EDR),  2)  1-4  h,  late  downregulation 
profile (LOR) and 3) 0-4 h, overall downregulation profile (ODR)_ 
The downregulated genes show a 2-fold or more decrease in 
expression level for all  profiles. 

mRNA expression (Fig.  1) (Lim eta/., 2005). 

We developed two criteria to check the validity of this 
hypothesis: 1) the number of common miRNA binding sites 
shared by a group of temporally co-regulated genes; ie, 
the  commonality  of  miRNA  binding  sites,  and  2)  the 
number of genes that are targeted by a specific miRNA in 
a group of temporally co-regulated genes; ie, the specificity 
of miRNA binding sites. We performed statistical analyses 
by comparing the commonality and specificity scores in 
groups of co-downregulated genes with the same measures 
relative to groups of randomly-chosen genes. We showed 
that both commonality and specificity are low and are not 
especially higher for groups of co-down regulated genes 
when compared with groups of random genes. This result 
indicates that both  commonality and  specificity are  not 
significant features to define groups of a priori co-downre(cid:173)
gulated genes, and that miRNA regulation is not a hard(cid:173)
wired counterpart of effective functional regulation circuits 
in  cells  and  can  adapt  dynamically to  external  stimuli. 
Further analysis of single knockout conditions revealed 
that miRNA regulation  may be involved  not only at late 
phases (after transcription) but also at early times.  Our 
result  suggests  that  1)  miRNA  regulation  in  wild-type 
conditions  is  repressed  at  early  times  in  order  not  to 
interfere with the response to stimuli, and 2) the interplay 

between  miRNA and  signaling  molecules/transcription 
factor regulation exists from early signaling processes. 

Materials and Methods 

Experiments and Microarray dataset 
We  utilized  microarray  data  obtained  from  time-series 
experiments  (0,  1,  and  4  h)  performed  on  peritoneal 
macrophages  from  wild-type,  Myoss·'·,  TRIF'·,  and 
MyD88-1TRI F'· mice treated with 100 ng/ml LPS (Salmonella 
minnesota Re595,  Sigma). Affymetrix mouse expression 
array M30 microarray chips were used for gene expression 
detection.  The  microarray  dataset  obtained  from  these 
experiments contains expression levels for 22690 Affymetrix 
probe set IDs, for a total of 12 expression level measurements. 
The experimental details can be found in Hirotani eta/., 2005. 

Databases 
We used the Pictar database (http://pictar.bio.nyu.edu) for 
target predictions of mouse miRNAs based on conservation 
in mammals (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, and dog) 
(Baskerville  et  a/.,  2005).  The  Pictar  database  uses 
algorithms in sequences and evolutionarily-conserved data 
among vertebrate miRNA target predictions to determine 
to their reliability. The initial dataset of miRNAs contains 
264 different miRNAs. 

Selection of initial list of genes 
Refseq  RNA IDs are used as genes identifiers. As one 
Refseq RNA I D can correspond to one or more Affymetrix 
IDs,  the  expression  level  of  one  gene  is  the  highest 
Affymetrix expression  row of Affymetrix expressions in 
microarray dataset corresponding  to the  same  Refseq 
RNA IDs. Only genes having at least one miRNA binding 
site were considered. Unlike previous studies (Hirotani et 
a/., 2005), in which only genes having a signaling intensity 
of more than 100 points in expression level were considered, 
in our study we are also considering expression changes 
for genes showing relatively low expression levels, as the 
previous threshold may hide many important processes. 
As a result, we obtained a list of 2969 genes for the analysis. 

Co-downregulated genes 
As miRNAs are known to be negative regulators of mRNA 
(Lim  eta/.,  2005),  for our study,  we focused  on  genes 
showing  a  decrease  in  temporal  expression  levels 
characterized  by one of the following  three expression 
profiles:  1) early downregulation profile (EDR) defined by 
a 2-fold decrease in expression level between 0 and 1 h, 
2) late downregulation profile (LOR) between 1 and 4 h, 

and 3) overall downregulation profile (OOR) between 0 and 
4  h  (Fig.  1) for each  experimental  condition  (wild-type, 
My088 KO,  TRIF KO,  or double KO).  For each of these 
profiles (EOR,  LOR,  and OOR), we selected gene pairs 
exhaustively  and  calculated  their temporal  expression 
Pearson correlation coefficient, taking then genes (n = 5, 
10, 15, .. .40) that have the highest correlations. Among the 
identified group of genes, we eliminated repeating groups, 
that is, groups that contain more than 80% the same genes. 
To check whether co-regulated genes share a higher 
proportion of common miRNA binding sites, we defined 
commonality and specificity scores: 

Commonality score 
For each group of n genes, we eaFt extract p pairs of genes: 

p= 

n(n~ 1)

( 1) 

For each  pair of genes,  we computed the commonality 
score by taking the ratio of the number of miRNA bincfing 
sites shared by both genes to the total number of miRNA 
binding sites in both genes: 

Commonalitypair  = 

No.  of miRNA  binding 

sites  shared  by  both  genes 

Total  no.  of miRNA  binding  sites 

in  both  genes 

(2) 

By averaging the  ratios of all  the pairs,  we defined the 
average miRNA binding sites sharing ratio for the group:

Specificity score 
It is possible that commonality scores can be low for genes 
that possess a large number of miRNA binding sites. To 
avoid this case, we defined a measure for the sharing of 
specific miRNA binding sites in co-regulated gene pairs, 
called the specificity score. 

For each group of n genes,  we calculated the specificity 

score for each individual miRNA binding site: 

Specificityhiodiogsite  =

We next defined the  Maximum miRNA Binding  Site 
Specificity  Score  (MMBSS)  to  represent  group  score, 
which is the specificity score of the most highly-represented 
miRNA binding sites among a group of genes:

Statistical Significance 
To check for eventual statistically significant differences 
between randomly chosen gene groups (control) made by 
all the couples from n genes (n = 5 to 40) and test groups 
(eg,  EOR)  with  the  same  numerosity,  we  carried  out 
commonality and specificity computations and checked 
for  95%  confidence  interval.  To  determine  significant 
differences  between  the  two  populations,  we  further 
performed t-test on the populations made by control and 
test groups. 

Results and Discussion 
We evaluated commonality and specificity scores for the 
three profiles of early downregulated genes (EOR),  late 
downregulated genes (LOR), and overall downregulated 
genes (OOR),  and found surprisingly both commonality 
and  specificity scores were very low.  The commonality 
score was approximately 2% and the specificity score was 
on average about 25% (since we are using only one miRNA 
with the highest MMBSS, 25% can be considered very 
low). These scores are similar to those relative to randomly 
selected genes (Fig. 2A and Fig. 3). This result indicates 
that the sharing of miRNA binding sites (static view) is not 
a  suitable criterion  to identify dynamically co-regulated 
genes. We also observe, from Fig. 2A, that the commonality 
score of EOR, regardless of the number of genes in each 
group, is always lower than randomly-selected genes, and 
scores of LOR and OOR are always higher. In randomly(cid:173)
selected genes, we expect the group to contain a mixture 
of both miRNA-regulated and -unregulated genes. Hence, 
focusing  on  the  lower  commonality  scores  of  EOR 
compared  with  randomly-selected  genes,  this could  be 
due to two possible scenarios: 1) miRNA regulation is not 
active at early time points (0-1  h), or 2) miRNAs in the EDR 
group of genes are suppressed  by signaling molecules 
such as transcription factors (Fig. 4). 

In order to further evaluate these two hypotheses, we 
investigated the commonality score for other conditions 
(TRIF KO,  My088 KO, My088/TRIF OKO conditions, Fig. 
2). If miRNAdoes not possess early regulation (0-1  h), the 
commonality score of EDR is  not expected to change. 
However, looking firstly at the TRIF KO (Fig. 28), we notice 
that the commonality score of genes showing  an  EOR 
profile was increased. In addition, the commonality score 
for LOR was reduced,  showing the  reverse  trend  from 
wild-type conditions. This oould imply that miRNA regulation 
has increased at early times and decreased at later times, 
suggesting that under wild-type conditions, TRIF-dependent

Fig.  4.  Schematic representation  of the  possible  interactions 
between  MyD88 /TRIF-dependent pathways and  miRNAs.  In 
innate  immune  responses,  Toll-like  Receptor  4  (TLR4)  is 
activated by LPS ( 1 ), and triggers MyD88- and TRIF-dependent 
signaling pathways (2), which in turn activate transcription factors 
that control gene expression. These transcription factors may also 
repress miRNA genes at early time points (3a, 3b), and activate 
miRNA  genes  later  time  points  (4),  to  dynamically  control 
miRNA-mediated gene silencing (5). 

pathways are 1) suppressing early miRNA regulation (0-1 
h),  and 2) activating late miRNA regulation (Fig. 4). 

For MyD88 KO conditions,  we observed,  compared 
with  wild-type  conditions,  that the  commonality scores 
showed that EDR profiles are similar to that of LOR profiles 
(Fig. 2C). The increase of EDR and ODR compared with 
random  genes  at  early  time  points  for  MyD88  KO 
conditions suggests that MyD88-dependent pathways are 
repressing  miRNA  genes  at  early  times.  Analyzing 
MyD88ffRIF DKO conditions confirms that disabling both 
pathways removes miRNA regulation, since EDRis similar 
to random genes, and LOR and ODR profiles are lower 
compared with random genes (Fig.  20). 

Conclusion 
We have shown  that miRNA sharing  among temporally 
co-regulated genes is low, indicating that miRNA regulatory 
processes are not hard-wired. Our result demonstrates that 
approaches that use static miRNA binding sites to suggest 

Dynamic Regulation of MiroRNA in  Innate Immunity  111 

miRNA  regulatory  processes  is  clearly  not  sufficient. 
Moreover, analyzing various experimental conditions in 
innate immunity, we suggest that miRNA regulation may 
not only be involved at late phases (after transcription) but 
also at early times upon cellular stimulation. This last point 
may  suggest  the  existence  of  dynamic  interactions 
between  miRNA and  signaling  molecules/transcription 
factor regulation and will be investigated next (Piras eta/, 
in  preparation).
