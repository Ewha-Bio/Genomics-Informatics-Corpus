Abstract 
Embryonic  stem  cells  can  be  differentiated into various 
types of cells, requiring a tight regulation oftranscription. 
Biomarkers  related to each  lineage of cells  are used to 
guide the  differentiation  into  neural  or any other fates.  In 
previous experiments, we reported the guided differentiation 
(GD}-specific  genes  by  comparing  profiles  of random 
differentiation  (RD).  Interestingly 68%  of differentially 
expressed genes in GD overlap IIIith that of RD, vvflich makes 
~difficult for us to separate the lineages by examining several 
markers.  In  this  paper,  we  design  a prediction  model  to 
identify the differentiation into neural fates from  any other 
lineage. From the profiles of 11 ,376 genes, 203 differentially 
expressed genes between neural and random differentiation 
were selected by random variance T-testvvith 95%confidence 
and 5%false dscovery rate. Based on support vector machine 
algorithm, we could select 79 marker genes from the 203 
infonnative genes to construct the optimal prediction model. 
Here we propose a prediction  model for the prediction  of 
neural fates from random differentiation vvflich is constructed 
with  a perfect accuracy.

Introduction 
Development of mammalian central nervous system (CNS) 
is a complex process involving an  orchestrated regulation 
of structural and regulatory genes through differentiation 
stages ofmultipotent stem cells into neurons (Sasai, 1998). 
Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells retain the characteristics 
ofmultipotent stem cells exhibiting the infinite self-renewal 
activity and the differentiation potential into various kinds

of lineages (Czyz and VVobus,  2001).  Numerous efforts 
have  been  made  to  induce  ES  cells  into  neurons  by 
regulating  transcriptions  of critical  genesin  the  hope  of 
using these  cells  for therapy for  neurological  disorders 
such as  Parkinson's disease. 

In previous WJrks, thanks to the microanaytechnology, we 
profiled the transaiptions oftvvu dfferentiation moclel: guided 
differentiation into DAneurons (GD) and random dfferentiation 
into EB (RD), and reported neural specific genes by corrparing 
the random differentiation (Lee  €t  a/.,  2006). HO'v\ever, most 
differentially expressed genes in GO overlapped IIIith those of 
RD. This makes it dflicult fer us to separate the differentiation 
types by exanining several markers. 

In  this paper,  we  constructed  a prediction  model  to 
identify neural differentiation from random differentiation 
using support vector machine vvflich  outperfonns in  binary 
classification tasks. From the profiles of 11 ,376 genes, we 
selected  203  differentially  expressed  genes  between 
neural and random differentiation using a feature selection 
method  vvhich  is  random  variance  T-test  with  95% 
confidence  and  false  discovery rate  <  0.5%.  Then,  we 
investigated about compact biomarker gene set based on 
support vector machine algorithm. VVe  could  select  79 
marker  genes  among  the  203  informative  genes  to 
construct optimal prediction model. As a result, a prediction 
model for discriminate neural  differentiation from random 
differentiation is constructed with  perfect accuracy. 

Methods 
Experimental design and rricroanay experiments 
To  detect  neural  fates  from  random  differentiation,  we 
used  microarray  dataset  vvhich  were  experimented  at 
previous study(Lee eta/., 2006). The microarraydataset 
consists of neural differentiation and random differentiation 
of embryonic stem cells.  Each differentiation process has 
5 stages of cell  cultivation. 

Guided  differentiation  to  the  DA  neuron  of  mouse 
embryonic stem cells was induced as described previously 
(Lee eta/., 2000).  Briefly undifferentiated ES cells (stage 1) 
were  grOWl  on  gelatin-coated  tissue  culture  plates  in 
KO-DMEM meda. To induce EB fonnation (stage 2), the cells 
were dssociated into a single-cell suspension and plated onto 
non-adherent bacterial culture dishes at a densityof2.5x 104 
cellslcrrf in the  KO medium. After four days, the cells 11\ere 
transferred to the  orignal tissue culture dsh  in  a serum-fi"ee 
lnsulinffransfenin/Selenium'Rbronectin  (ITSF)  medium  to 

2  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  5(1) 1-5, March  2007 

select  the  nestin-positive  cells  (stage  3).  After  6 days  of 
selection, the cells were expanded (stage 4) bytransfening 
to the plate coated vvfth polyom~hine and laminin in N2 medum 
supplemented vvith laminin/bFGF/ SHH/FGFS. After 6 days, 
bFGF was removed to induce the differentiation (stage 5) in 
N2 medium supplemented vvith laminin and ascorbic acid for 
6 days. Three independent biological replicates were taken 
at four stages  of dopaminergic differentiation. 

For random differentiation, EBs were dissociated and 
plated  onto  a  tissue  culture  dish  in  DMEM  with  fetal 
bovine  serum  and  antibiotics  for  indicated  periods.For 
random  differentiation model, three biological replicates 
were made at day 4 (stage 2), 8 (stage 3),  15 (stage 4), 
and 21  (stage 5) to extract total  RNA. 

Total  RNAs from undifferentiated mouse ES cells were 
used as a reference group in all the experiments. Total RNA 
was prepared by using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen, Calsbard, 
CA). The array used in this experiment was the Macrogen 
Mouse  Oligo  11K  Chip  (Macrogen,  Seoul,  Korea)  as 
described previously (Park €t  a/., 2002; Kim eta/., 2004). Cy3 
and Cy5 fluorescent intensities were determined using the 
GenePix scanner(Axon  Instruments, Union City, CA), and 
images were analyzed using the GenePix Pro to calculate 
relative ratios and to detennine confidence intervals. 

Data preprocessing 
Fluorescent intensity data was  imported to  an  in-house 
microarray database. Variance stabilizing nonnalization 
by  Huber  et  a/.  was  applied  with  the  'vsn'package  in 
Bioconductor using the R statistical package (Huber eta/., 
2002). After perfoming intensity-dependent global LCM/ESS 
regression,  spatial  and  intensity  dependent  effects  were 
managed by pin-group LCM/ESS nonnalization follovving by 
the approach of Yang eta/. (Yang eta/., 2000). 

The gene expression dataset was registered to the Gene 
Expression  Onnibus  (http:/fw.N.N.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  geo/) 
under  the  accession  numbers,  GSE3527  for  random 
differentiation and GSE3528 for guided differentiation. In this 
study, 18 slidesvvtlich consist of stage 3, 4, and 5 expression 
profiles ofGD and RD vvith  biological triplicates are used, 
because stage 2 was common state between them. 

Feature Selection 
\/\/hen  analyzing  expression  profiles  using  machine 
learning methods, one ofthe most important processes is 
feature  (gene) selection for the target classes.  Although 
there are huge amount of genes in a microarray, the number 
of genes that show strong correlation vvith  a certain class is

relatively small. Hence the selection of the most relevant and 
infonnative  genes  for  target  classes  is  important.  Good 
feature set consists of those highly correlated vvith  a class 
but are uncorrelated vvith  other classes. 

Since  support  vector  machine  algorithm  doesn't 
embedfeature selection mechanism, informative features 
should be selected before the data mining algorithm is run, 
using some approach that is independent ofthe data mining 
task.  To  select  feature  set  with  discriminative  power, 
various feature selection methods have been used, such 
as information gain, Gini index, and statistical tests. In this 
study,  multivariate  pennutation  test vvith  t-statistics was 
used to identify discriminative genes between RD and GD. 
There  are  a variety  of benefits  to  feature  selection 
(Tan  et a/.,  2005).  Many  data  mining  algorithms  V\oUrk 
better if the  number  of attributes  in  the  data  is  lower, 
because feature selection can eliminate irrelevant features 
and reduce noise.  Moreover, feature  selection  can  lead 
to  a  more  understandable  model  because  the  model 
may involve fewer attributes.  Finally, the amount oftime 
and  memory required  by the  data  mining  algorithm  is 
reduced vvith  feature selection. 

Support- machine 
Support vector machines (S\/Ms) vvhich  are  supervised 
machine  learning  techniques,  have  exhibited  superb 
perfonnance in  binary classification tasks (Tan eta/., 2005; 
Vapnik,  1998;  Christianini  et  a/.,  2002).  Due  to  robust 
perfonnance,  Srvl\/s  have  been  adopted  in  a number  of 
applications  from  text  categorization  to  bioinfonnatics 
problems. Intuitively, S\/Ms aim at searching fora hyperplane 
that separates the tvvu dasses of data vvith the largest margin 
between the hyperplane and the point closest to it. 

We  used  a  sequential  minimal  optimization  (SMO) 
algorithm with a logistic regression model and RBF kernel 
for training a support vector classifier (Christianini  eta/., 
2002; Platt, 1998; Keerthi eta/., 2001; Wtten eta/., 2005). 
The SMO algorithm was derived by taking the idea of the 
decompositionmethod  to  its  extreme  and  optimizing  a 
minimal  subset  of just two  points  at  each  iteration.  The 
power  of this  technique  resided  in  the  fact  that  the 
optimization  problem  for  two  data  points  admitted  an 
analytical solution, eliminating the need to use an iterative 
quadratic optimizer as part of the algorithm. 

To evaluate perionnance of the prediction model, we 
trained support vector classifier based on  Leave-Ole-Out 
Cross-Validation  (LOOCV).  LOOCV  is  simple  n-fold 
cross-validation, vvflere n is the number of samples in the 
dataset (Tan eta/., 2005; Witten eta/., 2005). Each sample 
in tum was left out, and the S\/M algorithm trained all the 
remaining samples. It was judged by its correctness on the 

remaining instance- one or zero for success or failure, 
respectively. The results of all n judgments, one for each 
memberofthe dataset, were averaged, and that average 
represented  the  final  error  estimate.  LOOCV  had  the 
advantage of utilizing as much data as possible for training. 
In  addition, the testsets were mutually exclusive and they 
effectively covered the entire dataset. The dravvback ofthis 
approach  was that  it was  computationally expensive to 
repeat  the  procedure  n  times.  Nevertheless,  LOOCV 
seemed to offer a chance of squeezing the maximum out 
of a small dataset and obtaining as accurate an estimate 
as possible (Tan  eta/., 2005). 

Results 
Differentially expressed ganes 
Multivariate  pennutation  test  was  applied  to  evaluate 
statistical  significance of changes in the gene expression 
between GD and RD. Q.Jalite-quantile plot analysis showed 
that the residual quantiles were deviated from the theoretic 
quantiles. Hence we regarded the distribution ofthe data 
as abnonnal (V\Iilk eta/., 1968). Typical T-test assumes that 
the input dataholds nonnal distribution. Therefore we used 
the mu~ivariate pennutation test to collect the genes at a 95% 
confidence with  the false discovery rate of less than  5% 
(Kom eta/., 2004). The test statistics used were random 
variance version ofT-test for each gene (\Might €t  a/., 2003). 
Although T-testwas used, the multivariate pennutation test 
was non-parametric and did not require the assumption of 
nonnal distributions. By random variance T-test analysis, we 
selected  203  differentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs) 
between  GD and RD. 

Construction of the optimal prediction model 
\Mlen we constructed predction model using support vector 
machine based on weka environment with aforementioned 
203 discriminative genes, the model could predict the target 
class perfectly by LOOCV (Wright eta/., 2003). Since the 
number of discriminative genes V\e.S relatively numerous, we 
found the op:imal set of marker genes vvfth a perfect accuracy. 
A set of experiments were conducted using support vector 
machine by decreasing the numberofthe genesvvhich were 
sorted bytheirp-value. \Mlen the number of selected genes 
was less than 79, one RD example was predicted incorrectly 
as GD (94.4%accuracy). Therefore, we selected 79 genes 
as  a marker gene  set to  construct the optimal  prediction 
model  (Table 1 ). 

Gene ontology analyses 
To characterize the 79 marker genes, we analyzed gene 

4  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  5(1) 1-5, March  2007 

ontology (GO) categories of them in GD and RD (The Gene 
Oltology Consortium, 2000). This procedure finds  gene 
ontology categories that have higher than expected number 
of genes dfferentially expressed among the different classes 
of the samples based on  random variance T-tests (\1\h'ight 
and  Simon,  2003).  Gene  ontology  analyses  were 
perfonned based on  BRB-arraytools version  3.2.3. Then 
we  arranged  significant  GO  categories  into  molecular 
function, biological process, and cellular componentvvflich 
are presented to Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 respectively. 
lnterestingy in the aspect of molecular function, the genes 
related  vvith  lipid  transporter  activity,  structural  molecular 

activity, peptidase activity, DNA binding, hydrolase activity, 
and protein binding showed a significant variance (Table 2). 

Discussion 
Though we constructed the optimal prediction model with 
perfect  accuracy,  the  number  of training  samples  was 
relatively  small.  Dataset  was  made  up  of  triplicates 
biological replicates for each of the 3 differentiation stages 
ofGD and RD. To avoid the problem ofoverfitting and bias, 
we  evaluated  our  prediction  model  based  on  LOOCV. 
LOOCV makes prediction model more robust because the

Detection of Neural Fates from  Random  Differentiation :Application of Support Vector Machine  5 

greatest possible amount of data is used for training in each 
case,  vvhich  presumably increases the  chance  that the 
classifier is an  accurate one. 

Since  each  GD  and  RD  class  had various  samples 
vvhich  were taken  at different stages,  there were some 
variations among samples in each class according to the 
degree of differentiation. Ovving to the principle of feature 
selection, uninformative genesvvhich showed variation of 
expression in  a classwere filtered out. Through the feature 
selection  process,  most  of  genes  vvhose  expression 
profiles had dynamical changes according to the degree of 
differentiation  were  excluded  from  training  prediction 
model. Hence, the dynamics of gene expression according 
to  differentiation  stages  was  not  considered  in  our 
prediction model. 01 the other hand, the characteristic of 
feature selection made it easy to detect neural fates from 
random differentiation regardless of differentiation stages. 
The results of gene ontology analysis helped interpretation 
of the  characteristics  of 79  biomarkers. This  analysis was 
dfferentthan annotating a gene list using 00 categories. The 
00 analysis corrputed statistically significant 00 categories 
for given  gene list. 

We have presented a  method to  detect neural fates 
from  random  differentiation  of mouse stem cells  based 
on  gene expression profiles.  Proposed prediction model 
vvhich  were  constructed  based  on  effective  statistical 
feature  selection  method  and  support  vector  machine 
algorithm perfonned. We investigated the compact set of 
biomarkers  with  perfect  prediction  accuracy.  The  79 
informative genes were selected as novel  candidates of 
biomarkers for neural fates. 

The dataset currently available contains relatively few 
training  examples  and  a  more robust  prediction  model 
needs  to  be  constructed  using  plenty  of  microarray 
experiments to put our study to practical  use.
