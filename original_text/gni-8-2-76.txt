Abstract

Although  autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  has  been 
thought  to  have  a  substantial  genetic  background,  major 
contributing  genes  have  yet  to  be  identified  or  success-
fully  replicated.  Immunological  dysfunction  has  been 
suggested  to  be  associated  with  ASD,  and  T  cell-medi-
ated  immunity  was  considered  important  for  the  devel-
opment  of  ASD.  In  this  study,  we  analyzed  163  ASD 
subjects  and  97  normal  controls  by  genomic  quantitative 
PCR  to  evaluate  the  association  between  the  copy  num-
ber  variation  of  the  7q34  locus,  harboring  the  TCRB 
gene,  and  ASDs.  As  a  result,  there  was  no  significant 
difference  of  the  frequency  distribution  of  TCRB  copy 
numbers  between  ASD  cases  and  normal  controls. 
TCRB  gene  copy  numbers  ranged  from  0  to  5  copies, 
and  the  frequency  distribution  of  each  copy  number  was 
similar  between  the  two  groups.  The  proportion  of  the 
individuals  with  ＜2  copies  of  TCRB  was  52.8% 
(86/163)  in  ASD  cases  and  57.1%  (52/91)  in  the  control 
group  (p=0.44).  The  proportion  of  individuals  with  ＞2 
copies  of TCRB  was  11.7%  (19/163)  in  ASD  cases  and 
12.1%  (11/91)  in  the  control  group  (p=0.68).  After  the  ef-
fects  of  sex  were  adjusted  by  logistic  regression,  ORs 
for  individuals  with  ＜2  copies  or  ＞2  copies  showed  no 
significant  difference  compared  with  the  diploid  copy 
number  as  reference  (n=2).  Although  we  could  not  see 
the  positive  association,  our  results  will  be  valuable  in-
formation  for  mining  ASD-associated  genes  and  for  ex-
ploring  the  role  of  T  cell  immunity  further  in  the  patho-

Introduction

Autism  spectrum  disorders  (ASDs)  are  complex  neuro-
developmental  disorders  with  the  core  features  of  im-
pairment  in  social  interaction  and  verbal  communication 
and  repetitive  or  stereotyped  patterns  in  behavior.  These 
disorders  typically  manifest  within  the  first  three  years  of 
life  (Klauck,  2006). 
The  etiology  of  ASD  is  still  largely  unknown.  Growing 
evidence  has  suggested  a  genetic  background  of  ASD 
development.  The  concordance  rates  of  ASD  in  mono-
zygotic  twins  were  reported  to  be  significantly  higher 
than  in  dizygotic  twins,  and  the  recurrence  rates  in  sib-
lings  are  approximately  10  times  higher  than  in  the  nor-
mal  population  (Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley,  2001). 
Cytogenetic  alterations  were  detected  in  7.4%  of  ASDs 
(Vorstman et al.,  2006),  and  some  alterations  have  been 
suggested  as  causative  factors  of  neurodevelopmental 
disorders  (Merikangas et al.,  2009).  Several  studies  have 
revealed  that  ASDs  are  associated  with  genetic  factors, 
such  as  single  gene  disorders  and  genetic  poly-
morphisms,  including  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  and  copy  number  variation  (CNV),  and  that  multi-
ple  genetic  factors  may  work  together  (McCauley et al., 
2005;  Santangelo  and  Tsatsanis,  2005).  Significant  asso-
ciations  have  been  reported  between  ASDs  and  CNVs 
of  various  genes,  such  as  NLGN3  (Xq13.1),  NLGN4 
(Xp22.23),  SHANK3  (22q13.3),  and  NRXN1  (2p16.3) 
(Christian  et al.,  2008;  Cook  et al.,  2008).  However, 
most  of  these  candidate  genes  have  been  neither  suc-
cessfully  replicated  in  independent  study  populations 
nor  functionally  validated  as  susceptible  genes  or  loci. 
    Maintaining  neuronal  cellular  connectivity  as  well  as 
synaptogenesis  has  been  suggested  to  play  a  role  in 
the  pathologensis  of  ASD  by  trafficking  of  immune  cells 
and  mediators  through  astroglial  and  microglial  cells 
(Gupta,  2000).  T  cell  receptor  beta  affects  TCR  signaling 
and  T  cell  polarity  (McKinney  et al.,  2010),  which  con-
sequently  affect  neuronal  activity,  development,  and 
plasticity  (Syken  and  Shatz,  2003).  Several  association 

studies  reported  that  an  imbalance  of  the  CD4＋:CD8＋ 
T  cell  ratio  was  found  in  children  with  ASDs  (Denny et 
al.,  1996;  Sweeten  et al.,  2003). 
    Another  interesting  clue  to  connect  the  TCR  with  ASD 
is  that  the  7q34-35  region,  where  the  T  cell  receptor  B 
variable  region  (TCRB)  is  located,  was  found  to  be  re-
arranged  in  a  patient  with  mental  retardation,  anxiety 
disorder,  and  autistic  features  (Dauwerse et al.,  2010).  In 
previous  reports,  the  7q31-34  (Risch  et al.,  1999)  and 
7q32.3-36.3  (Schanen,  2006)  regions  showed  associa-
tion  with  mental  retardation  and  ASD  phenotypic  fea-
tures  (Dauwerse  et al.,  2010;  Gu  and  Lupski,  2008). 
Based  on  these  reports,  it  seems  that TCRB  may  affect 
the  susceptibility  to  neurodevelopmental  disorders,  in-
cluding  ASD. 
    In  this  study,  we  analyzed  163  ASD  subjects  and  97 
normal  controls  by  genomic  quantitative  PCR  (qPCR)  to 
evaluate  the  association  between  the  7q34  locus,  har-
boring  the TCRB  region,  and  ASDs  and  the  potential  di-
agnostic  usefulness  of TCRB  in  the  Korean  population.

Methods 

Study  subjects

We  recruited  163  ASD  children  (137  boys  and  26  girls) 
who  were  diagnosed  with  ASD  from  the  Department  of 
Child  Psychiatry  of  Gyeongsang  National  University 
Hospital,  Ghil  Hospital  and  Seoul  National  University 
Hospital.  Each  proband  with  ASD  was  initially  screened 
by  two  board-certified  child  psychiatrists  according  to 
DSM-IV  criteria  (American  Psychiatric  Association,  1994) 

CNV  of  the  TCRB  Gene  in  Autism    77

and  assessed  using  the  Autism  Diagnostic  Interview- 
Revised  (ADI-R)  and  the  Korean  version  of  the  Autism 
Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule  (ADOS).  Probands  with 
chromosomal  abnormalities,  such  as  fragile  X  syndrome 
or  other  neurological  or  medical  conditions  suspected  to 
be  associated  with  ASDs,  were  not  included.  All  parents 
or  legal  guardians  of  probands  provided  written  in-
formed  consent  for  participation  in  this  study.  The  nor-
mal  control  samples  consisted  of  97  Korean  adult  males 
who  were 
free  of  any  psychiatric  or  congenital 
disorders.  This  study  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review  Boards  of  the  participating  institutions.

Selection  of  the  candidate  region

the  autism  gene  database  AuDB 

To  search  the  CNV  region  relevant  to  ASD,  the  Autism 
Chromosome  Rearrangement  Database  (ACRD)  inn  the 
database  of  Genome  Variants  (http://projects.tcag.ca/ 
autism/), 
(http:// 
www.mindspec.org/autdb.html),  and  the  UCSC  genome 
browser  (http://www.  genome.ucsc.edu/)  were  used.  We 
selected TCRB  on  the  7q34  region  as  the  candidate  re-
gion,  based  on  an  association  between  ASD  and  im-
munity  through  a  literature  analysis,  compared  it  with  a 
database  of  genomic  variants,  and  chose  the  primer  set 
by  in  silico  PCR  in  the  UCSC  browser  (Fig.  1).  The  se-
lected  region  is  located  on  the TCRB  gene  cluster,  and 
it  has  been  reported  that  there  are  many  CNVs  and  du-
plication  sites  (Redon  et al.,  2006). 

Quantitative  PCR  for  TCRB  gene

for 

The  primer  sequences  (141,702,316-141,702,404;  NCBI 
build  36)  of 
follows: 
5'-TGAGGCAGCCTGT  GTGCTTTACTA-3' 
forward 
and  5'-TAGGCTACACATGCCCTGCTACAA-3'  for  reverse. 
As  a  diploid  internal  reference  gene  for  genomic  qPCR, 
a  gene  encoding  heparan  sulfate,  6-O-  sulfotransferase 
3  (HS6ST3),  was  used,  because  neither  CNV  nor  seg-
mental  duplication  in  this  gene  has  been  observed,  ac-
cording  to  the  Database  of  Genomic  Variants.  The  pri-
mer  sequences  for  the  internal  control  are  as  follows: 
5'-CGCTACCACCACACCAAGCAG-3'  for  forward  and 
5'-CCACCTGGCTGTTGTAGTCCTC-3' for reverse. Genomic 
qPCR  was  performed  using  the  Mx3000P  qPCR  system 
(Stratagene,  La  Jolla,  CA).  Twenty  microliters  of  re-
al-time  qPCR  mixture  contained  20  ng  of  genomic  DNA, 
SYBR  Premix  (FINNZYMES,  Finland),  1×  ROX,  and  10 
pmol  primers.  Thermal  cycling  conditions  consisted  of 
one  hot  start  cycle  of  10  min  at  95oC,  followed  by  40 
cycles  of  5  sec  at  95oC,  10  sec  at  55oC,  and  20  sec 
at  72oC.  After  the  PCR  reactions,  melting  curve  analysis 
was  performed 
to  confirm  specific  amplification. 
NA10851  DNA  (Coriell,  Camden,  NJ,  USA)  was  used  as 

a  calibrator.  All  qPCR  experiments  were  performed  in 
triplicate,  and  amplification  efficiencies  for  both  the  tar-
get  and  internal  reference  genes  were  evaluated  using  a 
standard  curve  over  serial  1:5  dilutions  using  MxPro 
Version  3.00  software.  To  assess  efficiency  of  PCR  am-
plification,  the  Ct  value  was  determined  at  the  cycle  at 
which  the  amplicon  of HS6ST3  attained  the  threshold  of 
the  standard  curve.  Relative  copy  number  was  calcu-
lated  by  the  ΔΔCt  method  using  the  Ct  values,  as  de-
scribed  elsewhere  (Yim et al.,  2010).  The  copy  number 
−ΔΔCt,  where  ΔCt  is  the  dif-
for TCRB  was  defined  as  2
ference  in  threshold  cycles  for  the  sample  in  question, 
normalized  against  a  reference  gene  (HS6ST3)  and  ex-
pressed  relative  to  the  value  obtained  by  NA10851  DNA 
(individual/NA10851).  We  assumed  the  median  value  of 
the TCRB  qPCR  ratios  in  the  normal  control  group  to  be 
diploid  and  adjusted  all  measured TCRB  qPCR  ratio  val-
ues  accordingly.  Then,  the  adjusted  ratio  values  were 
rounded  off  to  the  nearest  integer.

Statistical  analysis

Statistical  procedures  were  performed  using  Stata  soft-
ware  (version  10.0;  Stata  Corporation,  College  station, 
TX,  USA).  The  χ2-test  was  used  to  test  allelic  differ-
ences  between  the  case  and  control  groups.  p＜0.05 
was  considered  to  be  statistically  significant.

Results

All  measured  copy  number  ratio  values  in TCRB  and  the 
controls  were  converted  to 
integers,  as  described 
above.  There  was  no  significant  difference  in  the  fre-
quency  distribution  of TCRB  copy  number  between  ASD 
cases  and  normal  controls.  As  shown  in  Table  1, TCRB 
copy  numbers  ranged  from  0  to  5  copies,  and  the  fre-
quency  distribution  of  each  copy  number  was  similar 
between  the  two  groups.  The  proportion  of  individuals 
with  ＜2  copies  of  TCRB  was  52.8%  (86/163)  in  ASD 
cases  and  57.1%  (52/97)  in  the  control  group  (p-value= 

0.44)  (Fig.  2).  The  proportion  of  individuals  with  ＞2 
copies  of TCRB  was  11.7%  (19/163)  in  ASD  cases  and 
12.1%  (11/91)  in  the  control  group  (p-value=0.68).  To 
estimate  the  odds  ratio  (OR)  of  ASD,  we  chose  the  dip-
loid  copy  number  group  as  a  reference  point.  After  the 
effects  of  sex  were  adjusted  by  logistic  regression,  ORs 
for  individuals  with  ＜2  copies  or  ＞2  copies  showed  no 
significant  difference  compared  with  the  diploid  copy 
number  as  reference  (n=2).  Since  the  age  variable 
showed  a  strong  colinearity  with  the  case-control  status, 
only  the  effect  of  sex  was  adjusted  through  logistic 
regression.  The  adjusted  OR  was  also  insignificant  (1.05, 
95%  CI  0.80-1.38).

Discussion

Immunological  dysfunction  has  been  suggested  to  be 
associated  with  ASD  (Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley, 
2001;  Rutter,  2005).  Especially,  T  cell-mediated  im-
munity  has  been  considered  important  for  the  develop-
ment  of  ASD  (Cohly  and  Panja,  2005).  To  maintain  im-
mune  balance  against  numerous  MHC  molecules  in  the 
central  nervous  system,  the  rejoining  of  the  TCR  plays 
a  role  in  T  cell  responses.  In  autistic  children  and  their 
families,  autoimmune  disorders,  such  as  asthma,  have 
been  reported  to  be  more  common  than  in  the  normal 
population  (van  Gent et al.,  1997).  Also,  elevated  levels 
of  IFN-γ  in  postmortem  autistic  patients  have  sug-
gested  a  possible  association  between  the  pathogenesis 
of  ASDs  and  impairment  of  T  cell-mediated  immunity 
(Vargas  et al.,  2005). 
    Although  CNV  has  been  suggested  as  a  new  type  of 
genomic  diversity  among  normal  individuals,  including 
Koreans  (Freeman et al.,  2006;  Yim et al.,  2010),  it  also 
seems  to  play  a  certain  role  in  disease  susceptibility.  A 
number  of  significant  CNVs  on  chromosome  7  and  15 
have  been  suggested  to  be  associated  with  ASD 
(Marshall et al.,  2008).  In  addition,  among  copy  number 
alterations,  changes  on  chromosome  7  have  been  re-
ported  to  be  associated  with  various  psychiatric  dis-
eases,  such  as  ASD  and  mental  retardation.  For  exam-
ple,  complex  rearrangements  on  chromosome  7q  were 
identified  in  patients  with  mental  retardation,  anxiety  dis-
order,  and  autistic  features  (Dauewerse  et al.,  2010). 
One  of 
the  key  ASD-associated  genes,  named 
CNTNAP2,  is  located  on  7q35  (Arking  et al.,  2008). 
    Our  target  locus  is  a  variable  region  in  TCRB. 
Abnormalities  in TCRB  have  been  reported  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  immunological  defects  (Currier  et al.,  1998; 
Zhao  et al.,  1994).  Based  on  the  previous  findings  de-
scribed  above,  we  hypothesized  that  the  CNV  of  the 
TCRB  gene,  located  on  7q34,  may  be  associated  with 
ASDs.  We  explored  this  possibility  by  genomic  qPCR, 

CNV  of  the  TCRB  Gene  in  Autism    79

targeting  the TCRB  gene,  but  we  did  not  find  any  evi-
dence  of  association.
    There  are  several  limitations  of  this  study.  First,  we 
examined  one  locus  to  quantify  the  DNA  copy  number 
dosage  of TCRB  (7q34).  To  represent  the  copy  number 
status  of  this  gene  more  reliably,  several  more  qPCR 
probes  must  be  examined  in  the  same  study  subjects. 
Second,  the  study  size  was  not  large  enough  to  make 
a  definite  conclusion.
    In  conclusion,  there  was  no  significant  difference  in 
TCRB  gene  copy  number  between  ASDs  and  normal 
individuals.  An  additional  SNP  analysis  might  be  useful 
and  add  some  more  information.  Although  we  could  not 
see  a  positive  association,  our  results  will  be  valuable 
information  for  mining  ASD-associated  genes  and  for 
exploring  the  role  of  T  cell  immunity  further  in  the 
pathogenesis  of  ASD.
