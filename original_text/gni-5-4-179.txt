Abstract
An  increasing  number  of  primate  genomes  are  being 
sequenced. A direct comparison of repeat elements in 
human  genes  and  their  corresponding  chimpanzee 
orthologs will not only give information on their evolution, 
but also shed light on the major evolutionary events that 
shaped our species. We have developed REPEATOME 
to enable visualization and subsequent comparisons of 
human and chimpanzee repeat elements.

REPEATOME  (http://www.repeatome.org/)  provides 
easy access to a complete repeat element map of the 
human  genome, as well as repeat element-associated 
information. It provides a convenient and effective way to 
access the repeat elements within or spanning the functional 
regions in human and chimpanzee genome sequences. 
REPEATOME  includes  information  to  compare  repeat 
elements and gene structures of human genes and their 
counterparts  in  chimpanzee.  This  database  can  be 
accessed  using  comparative  search  options  such  as 
intersection, union, and difference to find lineage-specific 
or common repeat elements.

REPEATOME allows researchers to perform visualization 
and comparative analysis of repeat elements in human and 
chimpanzee. 

Availability: REPEATOME is freely available at http://www. 
repeatome.org.  The  web  interface  of  REPEATOME  is 
supported with JAVA and java scripts that enable formulation 
of queries against the database. Results are displayed either 
in tabulated or graphical formats.

Keywords: Repeat  element;  repeat  map;  comparative

Background 
The human genome has acquired a variety of repeat 
elements through successive retrotranspositions over the 
past 60 million years of evolution (Batzer and Deininger, 
2002). Among these repeat elements, Alu, L1, and SVA 
are known to be the most prevalent transposon families 
that have retroposed throughout primate evolution (Smit 
et al., 1995, The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis 
Consortium,  2005).  Together,  these  mobile  elements 
account for over 30% of the DNA in the human genome 
(Lander et al., 2001). Alu retrotransposition depends on a 
reverse transcriptase encoded by active L1 retroelements. 
These insertions may have contributed to the differential 
evolution of humans and chimpanzees (The Chimpanzee 
Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, 2005, Mills et al., 
2006).

Repeat elements such as Alu have previously been 
considered as junk DNA with no function (Ohno, 1991). 
However, recent studies suggested that repeats residing 
within  coding  regions,  promoter  regions,  introns, 
untranslated regions (UTRs), and CpG islands are 
all involved in various functions (Dagan et al., 2004, 
Le et al., 2003, Grover et al., 2005, Amaud et al., 2000, 
Thornburg et al., 2006).

Several existing databases support the identification of 
repeat sequences. For example, Repbase (Jurka, 2005) is 
a well-known nucleotide-sequence-repeat database that 
uses the RepeatMasker program (http://www.repeatmasker. 
org). A set of repeats can also be retrieved from the public 
University  of  California,  Santa  Cruz  (UCSC)  Genome 
Browser  (http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu)  (Hinrichs  et  al., 
2006), but it does not provide extensive repeat information 
for comparative genome analysis. Other species-specific 
databases include FREP (Nagashima et al., 2004), which 
stores  the  functional  repeats  in  mouse  cDNAs,  and 
TRbase, which stores tandem repeats related to disease 
genes in the human genome (Boby et al., 2005). However, 
these databases have not provided in-depth comparative 
data  on  repeat  elements  in  the  genomes  of  multiple 
species. 

In this report, we describe a new database of human 
and chimpanzee repeat elements, called REPEATOME. 

180 Genomics & Informatics   Vol. 5(4) 179-187, December 2007

This  database  aims  to  build  a  comprehensive  repeat 
element database to provide easy access to the repeat 
elements-as well as an additional 5kb of flanking DNA of 
the entire human and chimpanzee genomes. REPEATOME 
contains all human RefSeq genes (Pruitt et al., 2005) from 
the UCSC Genome Browser that contain repeat sequences, 
and provides putative repeat elements for both sets of 
genomes. It should therefore be a valuable resourcefor 
understanding primate evolution.

Construction & Contents 
Database construction
REPEATOME is a relational database built using MySQL 
(http://www.mysql.com/). The overview of data sources 
and flows for REPEATOME is described in Fig. 1. The 
construction steps are composed of 1) data extraction, 2) 
alignment of human and chimpanzee sequences, 3) gene 
annotation, 4) categorization of functional regions, and 5) 
screening of repeat elements.

Data extraction 
The location of each gene and its surrounding sequences 
were determined using the UCSC Genome Browser May 
2004 (hg17) and March 2006 (hg18) assemblies for human 
and  the  November  2003  (panTro1)  and  March  2006 
(panTro2) assemblies for chimpanzee. We downloaded 
the  sequence  and  annotation  data  for  hg17,  hg18, 
panTro1, and panTro2 from the UCSC Genome Browser 
FTP server. The extracted genome sequences spanned 
all RefSeq genes from the start to the end of the annotation, 
plus an additional 5 kb upstream and downstream of the 
start and end, respectively. We used refGene tracks from 
the UCSC database for gene information.

Alignment of human and chimpanzee sequences
Human and chimpanzee DNA sequences including 5 kb 
both upstream and downstream were obtained from the 
UCSC Genome Browser database (http://genome.ucsc. 
edu), and chimpanzee genome sequences were aligned 
against human genome sequences using BLAT (Blast-like 
Alignment Tool) (Kent, 2002), setting a minimum threshold 
of 98% sequence identity. We selected the comparison 
with the highest alignment score, which gave us a final 
working  set  of  19,577  (hg17/panTro1)  and  23,588 
(hg18/panTro2) non-redundant alignments for human and 
chimpanzee, respectively. The alignment was then parsed 
with a Perl script and stored in a MySQL database for 
further analysis. 

Gene  annotation 
The mRNA records in refGene were linked to other genetic 
databases through various accession keys provided by 
NCBI RefSeq, GI number, and gene name. In addition, 
each mRNA record was identified by its genome location, 
repeat name, repeat family, and repeat class. Intron, exon, 
and promoter records were linked to their corresponding 
mRNAs through the RefSeq ID. We also mapped mRNA 
records to the GO, OMIM, and EntrezGene (Maglott et al., 
2005) databases. 

Categorization of potential functional regions in 
genome sequences
Potential functional elements in human genome sequences 
were categorized into functional regions: promoter regions, 
CpG islands, 5' UTRs, translation start sites, splice sites, 
coding exons, introns, translation stop sites, polyadenylation 
signal sites, 3' UTRs, and 5-kb downstream regions. In this 
study, we used RefSeq gene (refGene) tracks from the 
UCSC database to obtain gene boundary information.
i. Promoter regions
We used the MATCH program in TRANSFAC Professional 
8.4 (Matys et al., 2006), which is a weight-matrix-based tool 
for searching putative transcription factor binding sites in 
DNA sequences, to predict transcription factor binding 
sites in 5-kb upstream sequences (promoter regions). We 
used  the  “minimizing  false-positive  errors”  option  for 
cut-offs and the “high-quality vertebrate” option for the 
grouping of matrices.
ii. CpG islands
CpG islands are associated with specific genes and are 
common near transcriptional start sites in vertebrates. 
CpG  islands  in  the  UCSC  database  are  predicted  by 
searching for a sequence and scoring each dinucleotide. 
We downloaded the complete tracks and filtered them out 
only  if  they  were  located  within  the  5-kb  upstream 
sequence.
iii. Splice sites
We considered the first and last 2 base pairs (bp) in introns 
as splice sites (Zhang, 1998). The positions of introns were 
obtained from refGene tracks in the UCSC database. 
iv. 5' UTRs, 3'UTRs, coding exons, introns, start codon, 

and stop codon

Position  information  of  exons,  intron  boundaries,  and 
coding sequence (CDS) boundaries is present in refGene 
tracks in the UCSC database (Pruitt et al., 2005). The 5' 
UTRs are the portion of sequences that are upstream of 
the CDS start sites, whereas the 3'UTRs are downstream 
of the CDS stop sites. In this study, coding exons were 

REPEATOME: A Database for Repeat Element Comparative Analysis in Human and Chimpanzee 181

considered as CDSs within the transcripts, meaning that 
5' UTRs are not coding exons. On the contrary, introns are 
non-transcribed sequences from DNA sequences, and 
hence can exist between UTRs and coding exons. The 
translational start and stop sequences are the first and last 
3 bp of CDSs, respectively.
v. Polyadenylation signal sites
In this study, we used ERPIN (Lambert et al., 2004) to 
identify polyadenylation signal sites in genes. ERPIN was 
downloaded from the internet and installed on a local PC. 
The training set file was also downloaded from the website, 
and the query database that contained only 3' UTRs was 
extracted from refGene tracks in the UCSC database 
(Pruitt et al., 2005). 

Screening repeat elements
There are two kinds of repeat data in REPEATOME: (i) 
those  obtained  from  repeat  tracks  from  the  UCSC 
database and (ii) those scanned on a local server using 
the  RepeatMasker  program.  First,  the  RepeatMasker 
annotations of the human (hg17, May 2004 freeze; hg18, 
March 2006) and chimpanzee (panTro1, November 2003 
freeze; panTro2, March 2006) genomes were obtained 
from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Site. Second, 
repeat element data were created using the RepeatMasker 
(version open-3.1.5) program installed on a local PC, 
which screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats 
and low-complexity DNA sequences. Sequences from 
Repbase Update (version 11.01, released on March 2006; 
http://www.girinst.org/Repbase_Update.html) were used 
to screen and annotate repetitive elements in human and

chimpanzee  mRNA  sequences,  including  those  5  kb 
upstream and 5 kb downstream using the RepeatMasker 
program.  All  repeats  detected  by  the  program  were 
collected in a MySQL database.

The distribution of repeat elements, over the functional 
regions of human and chimpanzee genomes, is shown in 
Table 1. The analysis of the human repeat data showed 
a general increase in the frequency of repeat elements in 
the functional regions compared with those of chimpanzee. 
However, the repeat elements in chimpanzee were likely 
to possess more splice sites than human elements.

Results & Discussion
Data retrieval
The  REPEATOME  database  provides  a  set  of  forms 
through which researchers can easily access, select, and 
compare repeats of interest. The REPEATOME database 
can be accessed at http://www.repeatome.org. It supports 
various types of queries, such as gene name, mRNA 
accession  number,  protein  accession  number,  repeat 
family name, repeat subfamily name, and repeat element 
name (Fig. 2A). In addition, a BLAST search (Altschul et 
al., 1990) with a user-defined query sequence can be 
performed against a certain genome version (hg17, hg18, 
panTro1, and panTro2). The search-results page shows 
the gene list that matchesthe query (Fig. 2B).

The results page shows a gene annotation containing 
the repeat elements, and includes extensive links to relevant 
resources such as the EntrezGene (Maglott et al., 2005), 
OMIM, GO, and PubMed (McEntyre et al., 2001) databases 
(Fig. 2C). Most repeat databases, except for Repbase, do 
not provide journal publications, whereas each of these 
repeat annotations in REPEATOME is accompanied by 

182 Genomics & Informatics   Vol. 5(4) 179-187, December 2007

its  PubMed  reference  link.  Repeat  sequences  are 
provided in FASTA format (Fig. 2D). Images are provided 
on the website by the Repeat Viewer program, which 
shows  the  alignment  of  human  and  chimpanzee 
sequences within a gene and in the 5-kb upstream and 5-kb 
downstream regions. In addition, it also shows the name 
and position of repeat elements in functional regions, and 
reports the predicted binding sites of transcription factors 
in their promoter regions (Fig. 2E).

Various filtering options
As one of the important functions of REPEATOME, various 
filtering methods can be applied to the REPEATOME 
database to select the functional region, repeat family, 
repeat subfamily, repeat name, repeat score, and repeat 
length. In addition, the database uses set operations such 

as  intersection,  union,  and  difference  to  find  lineage- 
specific or common repeats (Fig. 2D). Using filter options, 
users can search human-specific or chimpanzee- specific 
repeat elements.

Fig.  3  shows  snapshots  from  Repeat  Viewer  that 
illustrates these examples. The human RefSeq entry for 
NM_005441 is aligned with chimpanzee orthologs. Both 
the human and chimpanzee sequences contain the SVA 
repeat in the intron (Fig. 3A). In the case of the human 
RefSeq entry for NM_004000 aligned with the chimpanzee 
orthologs, the SVA repeats appear only in the human 
intronic regions (Fig. 3B). For RefSeq entry NM_206889 
aligned with its chimpanzee orthologs, only chimpanzee 
intronic sequences contain the SVA repeat (Fig. 3C). It is 
known that a large fraction of new transposon insertions 
in humans and chimpanzees are targeted preferentially to 
specific genes. Species-specific genetic variation may

The search-results page shows the gene list that matches the query. (C) Detailed information about human and chimpanzee 
RefSeq. (D) Filter options. This page provides the functionality for the filtering and comparison of repeat elements based on several 
options. An interesting option in REPEATOME is the "SPECIFIC" option for example, human-specific repeat elements can be 
selected using "human-specific" options. (E) The Repeat Viewer output. When a gene is selected, the numbers of repeat elements 
in each region of the human and chimpanzee genomes are displayed in the viewer.

(A) Both the human RefSeq entry for NM_005441 and its orthologous chimpanzee sequences contain the SVA repeat in their 
introns. (B) Only the human RefSeq entry for NM_004000 contains the SVA repeat. (C) Only the chimpanzee ortholog (human 
NM_206889) contains the SVA repeat. 

have contributed to the differential evolution of humans 
and chimpanzees (Mills et al., 2006). Functional studies 
will be necessary to further elucidate the roles of the 
transposon insertions.

Repeat Map 
Repeat Map allows users to search the database using the 
repeat  name,  with  Repeat  Map  Viewer  presenting  a 
graphical view of the search results. The search-results 
page shows the location of repeats with blue lines denoting 
cytogenetic locations, followed by repeat-elements tables 
linked to the RefSeq ID (Fig. 4).

Most  databases  containing  repeat  data  do  not  yet 
contain  detailed  comparative  information.  In  contrast, 
REPEATOME provides such information as the conserved 
region, functional region, and GC ratio, as well as the 

functionality of the Repeat Map Viewer and a number of 
filtering options.

Current Status and Future Directions 
Currently, REPEATOME is limited to RefSeq-identified 
repeats in the human genome, and we are incorporating 
all primate repeat elements as they are identified. The 
January 2006 assemblies of the chimpanzee genome 
(panTro2) have recently been added to the database. 
Other  possible  additions  include  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms within repeat elements. We will add all 
published data on repeat elements to the database as they 
are identified (Woo et al., 2007). In addition, we will consider 
adding  orthologous  sequences  from  animals  such  as 
macaca and mouse as outgroups to human-chimpanzee

comparisons. 

REPEATOME would be a useful resource for biologists 
who are interested in primate evolution, by providing a 
variety of repeat elements in a comparative perspective 
that are also associated with functional regions.
