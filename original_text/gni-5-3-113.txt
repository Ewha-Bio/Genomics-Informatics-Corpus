Abstract 
The development of microarray technology has facilitated 
the understanding of gene expression profiles. Despite its 
convenience, the cause of dye-bias that confounds data 
interpretation in dual-color DNA microarray experiments 
is not well known. In order to economize time and money, 
it  is  necessary to  identify the  cause  of dye  bias,  since 
designing dye-swaps to reduce the dye-specific bias tends 
to be very expensive. Hence, we sought to determine the 
reliable cause of systematic dye bias after treating murine 
macrophage RAW 264.7 cells with 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate 
(KDO),  interferon-beta  (IFN-~), and  8-bromoadenosine 
(8-BR). To find the cause of systematic dye bias from the 
point of view of fluorescence quenching, we examined the 
correlation between systematic dye bias and the proportion 
of each  nucleotide  in  mRNA and  oligonucleotide  probe 
sequence.  Cy3-dye bias was  highly correlated with the 
proportion of adenines. Our results support the fact that 
systematic dye bias is affected by fluorescence quenching 
of each feature. In addition, we also found that the strength 
of fluorescence quenching is based on not only dye-dye 
interactions but also dye-nucleotide interactions as well.

Introduction 
DNA  microarray  provides  a  wealth  of  information  on 
various  condition-specific 
regulation 
systems. Microarray also yields vast amounts of data at 
once, and one can interpret the microarray data based on 
the  intensity  of  dye  fluorescence.  Therefore,  while 
performing  data  interpretation,  the  effect  of  dyes  is 
considered one of the factors determining accuracy. Dye 
swap experiments have been done twice in hybridizations

in which each dye was used to alternately label the samples 
in order to normalize the dye-related bias (Tseng eta/., 
2001 ).  In spite of these preventive measures of dye bias, 
the Cy3/green channel may appear consistently brighter 
than the Cy5/red channel for a particular gene, thereby 
causing dye bias (Dobbin eta/., 2005). 

Previous reports have suggested various methods to 
rectify the problems associated with microarray (Dombkowski 
eta!., 2004;  Rosenzweig eta/., 2004;  Han  eta/., 2005), 
which  confounds  20%  of  data  interpretation  (Martin(cid:173)
Magniette eta/., 2005). Despite these efforts, the cause 
of dye bias remains ambiguous.  General  categories for 
various dye biases have been set forth  by Dobbin eta/. 
(2005), which are as follows: (1) dye bias that is similar for 
all  genes  on  an  array,  causing  one  channel  to  appear 
brighter overall than the other; (2) dye bias that depends 
on the overall spot intensity, and is different for bright spots 
than for dim spots; (3) dye bias that is associated with some 
subset of genes, but is consistent for the same gene across 
samples;  (4) dye bias that depends on a combination of 
characteristics of the sample as well as the gene.  In our 
investigation, we further subdivided the dye bias into two 
major categories: gene-specific dye bias and systematic 
dye bias. 

To  remove  systematic  dye  biases  from  microarray 
studies, there are currently various normalization methods 
available  (Yang  et a/.,  2002).  However,  due  to  limited 
information on the types of errors, scientists are still far from 
eliminating dye biases in microarray studies (Uchida eta/., 
2005). A microarray researcher may think that based on 
the previous information available, there may be various 
complicated reasons for dye bias (Martin-Magniette eta/., 
2005). For example, first of all, the intensity of the signal 
is related to the amount of transcript synthesis as well as 
the amount of transcript degradation. Second, amplified 
RNA degradation is affected not only by the amplification 
time,  but also by the types of bound dyes (Spiess eta/., 
2003).  Apart from  these,  intensity of the  signal  is  also 
affected by the strength of bonding between an antisense 
RNA and a probe on the chip. In addition, it is also known 
that the nature of the dye can affect melting temperature 
of the nucleic acid duplex (Randolph eta/., 1997). More 
interestingly,  the  microarray  intensity  signal  is  highly 
correlated  with  the fluorescence  quenching  of dye-dye 
interactions  as  a  result  of  dye  stacking  or  aggregate 
formation during the hybridization of dye-labeled samples

(Herz,  1974), which was verified by nuclease treatment 
experiments  (Cox  et  a/.,  2004).  The  fluorescence  of 
comronly-used dyes conjugated to oligocleoxyribonudeotides 
can also be quenched by the interactions between the dye 
and nucleobase (Cooper and Hagerman,  1990). 

In  our  studies,  we  focused  on  the  fluorescence 
quenching mediated by dye-dye interactions to determine 
a reliable cause of systematic dye bias using oligonucleotide 
microarray data of murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells 
treated with 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate (KDO), interferon-beta 
(IFN-~).  and  8-bromoadenosine  (8-BR).  We  further 
correlated  the degree of labeling  with the  proportion  of 
adenines  in  the  mRNA  sequence.  Since  the  labeled 
antisense RNAs were synthesized by the coupling reaction 
of mono-Cy3/mono-Cy5 molecules with aminoallyl- UTPs 
(aaUTPs)  (http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/cgi-binl 
ProtocoiFile.cgi;  AfCS  protocol  PP00000184),  which  are 
complementary to adenines in mRNA sequences, we also 
examined the role of the adenine proportion. 

Materials and Methods 
Cell culture,  treatment, and  RNA preparation 
The RAW 264.7 cell line is an immortalized macrophage 
clone  isolated  from  BALB/c  mice  transformed  with 
Abelson leukemia virus. These cells were maintained in 
RAW 264.7 growth medium (RAWGM; DMEM 0.87X, FBS 
10%,  HEPES  20  mM,  L-Giutamine  2  mM).  KDO  (100 
ng/ml), IFN-~ (300 pM), and 8-BR (100 11M) were applied 
individually and in combination with KDO to stimulate RAW 
264.7 cells for 1 hand 2 h, and then their RNA was extracted 
using TriPure (Roche) according to its protocol. Duplicate 
experiments were done for each treatment except for KDO, 
wherein individual treatments V~.ere performed in quadruplicate. 

Oligoarray fabrication and annotation 
Gene  expression  was  analyzed  by  custom-made  16K 
mouse oligo arrays with  15,631  65- or 70-bp oligomers 
printed on them. The oligomers were obtained from Operon 
and  Sigma-Genosys and were inkjet-printed onto glass 
slides by Agilent Technologies.  The gene contents are 
available through the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) as accession number GPL254. 

Aminoallyi-UTP (aaUTP) antisense RNA (aRNA) 
synthesis and microarray hybridization 
Each array was hybridized with the Cy5-labeled antisense 
RNA prepared from the RNA of ligand-treated cells and 
the Cy3-labeled antisense RNA prepared from the RNA 
oftime-matched control cells using the aminoallyl method 
(http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/cgi-bin/Protocol 

File.cgi; AfCS protocol PP00000184). Dye-swap labeling 
and array hybridization were performed for each pair of 
antisense RNA samples. 

Microarray fluorescent imaging 
The arrays were scanned using the Agilent Scanner G2505A 
(Agilent Technologies) with maximum red and green (Cy5 
and Cy3) fluorescence intensities around 65,000. 

Data selection and analysis 
For each set of microarray data, we filtered out features 
based on four criteria: ( 1) control features, (2) any features 
with a green or red fluorescence signal that was saturated 
("glsSaturated" or "rlsSaturated" flags),  (3)  non-uniform 
features ("glsFeatNonUnifOL" or "rlsFeatNonUnifOL" flags), 
and  (4)  features  that  had  fluorescence  signals  below 
background. The expression changes of filtered features 
are  represented  as  log2-(Cy5/Cy3),  also  called  log-FC 
(log-Fold Change). 

Selection  of gene-specific (non-systematic)  dye 
bias 
We considered the features as gene-specific dye bias in 
which the value of log-FC was higher than 0.378 or lower 
than -0.378 (1.3-fold change) at the same direction in both 
the  first  comparison  and  the  dye-swapped  one  in  56 
independent  experiments.  as  gene-specific  dye  bias. 
Gene-specific dye  bias  was  visualized  by  the  Multiple 
Experiment  Viewer  (MeV:http://  www.tigr.org/software/ 
tm4/mev.html). 

Systematic dye bias 
Besides the gene-specific dye bias, there also exist different 
types of dye bias in which the signal intensities of regular 
and the dye-swapped results are unreliable. In other words, 
if the log-FC value of one feature is 2 in a regular experiment, 
then the log-FC value of dye must be -2 in the dye swap 
experiment,  but  some  features  showed  very  different 
values.  We  have  chosen  those  features  that  showed 
p-values lower than 0.001  by two-tailed student's t-test of 
log-FC  on  KDO  (1  h)-treated  experiments.  "Degree  of 
Cy3-dye bias" indicates the sum of average log-FC values 
of regular experiments and those of dye-swapped ones. 

Correlation  between  dye bias  and fluorescence 
quenching 
The  correlation  between  systematic  dye  bias  and  the 
proportion of each nucleotide in the mRNA sequence was 
calculated by Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. 
The degree of Cy3-dye bias was reformed to the rank of 

Fluorescence Quenching Causes Systematic Dye Bias in Microarray Experiments Using Cyanine Dye  115 

Cy3-dye bias to be used for Spearman correlation. 

Results 

Gene-specific dye bias 
We selected the features showing net fold changes of 1.3 
to assess dye bias in more than 70% of the 56 independent 
microarray  experiments.  Based  on  these  criteria,  65 
features were chosen  and  we could  see intuitively that 
these gene-specific dye bias features accumulated in four 
regions  on the chip.  Fig.  1 shows the location of those 
features on the microarray as visualized by MeV, where 
the systematic dye bias spots, always showing green in 
the  scanned  image,  are  represented  by their average 
log-FC values.  In MeV visualization, the downregulated 
features,  whose log-FC values were less than zero,  are 
shown in green. On the other hand, red colors indicate the 
features that show upregulation, and their log-FC values 
are greater than zero. 

Systematic  dye  bias  and  its  correlation  with 
fluorescence quenching 
Features  selected  by  two-tailed  student's  t-test  were 
examined with respect to their proportion of adenines in 
the  mRNA sequence.  First,  we sorted  out the features 
based  on  their  degree  of  Cy3-dye  bias.  Since  the 
correlation coefficients can be easily distorted by outliers, 
features  that  had  more  than  a  5%  difference  in  the 
proportion  of  adenines  with  respect  to  their  adjacent 
features were discarded from the studies. This resulted in 
a total  of 295 features that were chosen to analyze the 
correlation between dye bias and fluorescence quenching. 
The first 100 features with the highest Cy3-dye bias and 
the last 100 features with the lowest Cy3-dye bias showed 
a distinguished proportion of adenines (Table 1 ). 

Note:  Top  100,  features showing the highest Cy3-dye 
bias; bottom 1 00, features that show the lowest Cy3-dye bias. 
P-value was calculated through two-tailed t-test with Std. Dev 
(Standard Deviation of adenine proportion) in each feature. 
The higher the degree of Cy3-dye bias, the higher the 
proportion of adenines in the mRNA sequence as well as 
in the oligomer probe sequence. On top of that, the sum 
of the adenine proportions in mRNAs and oligomer probe 
sequences correlated more with the degree of Cy3-dye 
bias than with any other individual comparison (Fig.  2).

probe  sequences  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  The  correlation 
coefficient values of both guanines and thymines were less 
than 0.1,  but the proportions of adenines and cytosines 
were highly correlated with the degree of Cy3-dye bias. 

Discussion 

Theoretically  speaking,  the  intensity  of  fluorescently(cid:173)
labeled  nucleic  acid  should  increase  linearly  with  the 
number of dye molecules bound. However, recent studies 
indicated that the fluorescence of Cy3/Cy5-labeled DNA 
has a non-linear relationship irrespective of the degree of 
labeling  due to  the  effects  of fluorescence  quenching. 
According to Cox eta/. (2004 ),  if the degree of labeling 
increases,  it can effectively quench the fluorescence of 
Cy5-labeled nucleic acid than that of Cy3-labeled nucleic 

acid.  This  phenomenon  causes  an  increase  in  the 
fluorescence  of  Cy3-labeled  nucleic  acid  than  that  of 
Cy5-labeled, resulting in Cy3-dye bias. We confirmed this 
phenomenon through the correlation between the degree 
of Cy3-dye bias and the proportion of adenines in mRNA 
and oligonucleotide sequences in comparison with other 
nucleotide proportions (Fig.  3). 

If the degree of labeling in antisense RNA is the key 
factor for systematic dye bias, we can expect the same bias 
aspects in  different features designated for a  particular 
gene. We encountered various features for a given gene 
that did not show same aspects of dye bias. By observing 
the correlation between the dye bias and the proportion of 
adenines in oligonucleotide probe sequences, we found out 
the proportion of adenines in oligonucleotide sequences 
also  affected  dye  bias.  In  other words,  among  mRNA 

Fluorescence Quenching Causes Systematic Dye Bias in  Microarray Experiments Using Cyanine Dye  117 

sequences, the adenine proportion located adjacent to the 
oligonucleotide probe sequence was found to have a major 
effect on the signal intensity that caused the systematic 
dye bias (Fig. 2). 

Fig.  3  shows  that  the  proportions  of guanines  and 
thymines have no correlation with the Cy3-dye bias. On the 
other hand, the proportion of cytosines correlated somewhat 
with systematic dye bias. It can be explained by fluorescence 
quenching that resulted from the interactions between dye 
and nucleobase (Fukui eta/., 1999; Heinlein eta/., 2003; 
Marras eta/., 2002; Walter and Burke,  1997). 

Nucleotide quenching seems to affect dyes that emit 
green and yellow wavelengths more than the ones that emit 
blue  and  red  wavelengths  (Marras  et  a/.,  2002).  Since 
guanine is the most oxidizable nucleobase and exhibits good 
electron-donating properties, it was proposed that fluorescence 
quenching of dye-nucleobase interactions is dependent 
on the distance between a dye and its adjacent guanines, 
the complementary nucleobase of cytosines,  in  mRNA 
sequences (Atherton and  Harriman,  1993; Seidel eta/., 
1996; Steenken and Jovanovic,  1997). 

The  systematic  dye  bias  in  dual-color  microarray 
experiments using cyanine dyes basically comes from the 
difference between fluorescence-quenching degrees of 
the two dye molecules.  This difference in  fluorescence 
quenching is caused not only by dye-dye interactions but 
also  due to dye-nucleobase  interactions.  Because  the 
excessive degree of labeling causes bigger differences in 
fluorescence quenching of two different dye molecules, 
fitting the degree of labeling to an appropriate level can 
reduce systematic dye bias.
