Recent rapid advances in genetic research are ushering us into the genome sequence era, where an individual’s genome 
information is utilized for clinical practice. The most spectacular results of the human genome study have been provided by 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs). This is a review of the history of GWASs as related to my work. Further efforts are 
necessary to make full use of its potential power to medicine.

Introduction

We are in the genome sequence era. Now, we can all read 
our genome sequences if we have a bit of time and money. 
We can know our own program of life given by our fathers 
and mothers, which consists of 3,000,000,000 bp × 2 of 
DNA  sequence.  This  knowledge  (knowing  ourselves)  is 
revolutionizing medicine. The information gives us endless 
possibilities and a huge number of applications in research 
and clinical practice of medicine. Preventive medicine, per-
sonalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, and pharmacoge-
netics－these were just dreams on the desk or in the brain of 
medical scientists and doctors a few years ago but are all 
achievable at the bedside today.

The  best  application  of  the  information  obtained  by 
genome sequences is an attempt to conquer common dis-
eases or lifestyle-associated diseases. Common diseases are 
our common problem. It is a serious medical, social, and 
economical problem all over the world. It’s a problem of the 
present and the future world. The study of our genome has 
given us a tool to tackle it－the genome-wide association 
study (GWAS), which is now in full bloom. As we all know, 
GWASs have succeeded in the identification of susceptibility 
genes of many common diseases [1]. 

For more than 15 years, I have been working on genomic 
studies and committed to the GWAS from its dawn. In this 

paper, I briefly review a history of human genome research by 
focusing on GWASs related to my work. 

Beginning

Where were you at the start of the new century? What 

were you doing at that time? 

I  was  in  Japan,  in  Tokyo,  in  the  SNP  Research  Center 
(SRC). SRC was founded as a part of the Japanese Millen-
nium  Project  to  study  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs).  The  Millennium  Project  is  a  broad  effort  to  get 
industry, academia, and government to cooperate on a wide 
range of R&D projects to revitalize the competitiveness of 
the industry and to energize Japan's economy. The project 
focused on developing technologies for three main target 
areas of vital importance to Japan: informatics, ecology, and 
an  aging  society.  A  variety  of  large-scale  human  genome 
studies were done as projects to revolutionize medicine and 
cope  with  the  aging  society.  In  April  2000,  SRC  started 
collaboration  with  the  Human  Genome  Center  (HGC), 
Institute of Medical Science (IMS), University of Tokyo, and 
the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). Its mission 
was to identify up to 150,000 SNPs throughout the human 
genome within two years, to make the information available 
to  the  public,  and  to  develop  analytical  tools  for  poly-
morphisms (note: SRC was renamed Center for Genomic

SNPs  are  the  most  common  form  of  DNA  sequence 
variation.  They are  the  most useful  and  convenient poly-
morphic  markers  to  map  genes  that  modify  disease  sus-
ceptibility or those related to drug responsiveness. If we had 
a  dense  catalog  of SNPs,  we  could narrow  down  the  loci 
relating common disease susceptibilities to a small region 
containing one gene or so by linkage disequilibrium map-
ping. To get such a catalog, the discovery of a large number of 
SNPs was first necessary [2].

Draft Sequence to the First GWAS

The draft sequence was published in 2001 [3]. It was a 
collaborative work of the public sector via the international 
Human Genome Project (HGP) and the private sector via 
Celera Genomics. HGP refers to the international 13-year 
effort, formally begun in October 1990, to discover all the 
human  genes  and  make  them  accessible  for  further 
biological study. Another project goal was to determine the 
complete  sequence  of  the  human  genome.  Actually,  the 
latter group led by Dr. Craig Venter, was the critical player for 
the success of finishing the sequence, which invented the 
strategy of the shotgun sequence, followed by computational 
assembly [4]. It was a revolution in genomic research.

With  the  help  of  the  draft  sequence,  Japanese  Single- 
Nucleotide  Polymorphisms  (JSNP),  the  first  population- 
specific SNP database (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), was 
established as a collaborative work of HGC-IMS and JST [5]. 
A total of 190,562 genetic variations (mainly SNP) in 24 
subjects were discovered and confirmed and have been made 
available through this website [6].

Based  on  information  in  the  JSNP  database,  Tanaka’s 
group in SRC succeeded in identifying a susceptibility gene 
for myocardial infarction [7]. This study was the first GWAS 
in the world [8, 9]. By a two-stage association study－i.e., a 
GWAS followed by replication of a limited number of the 
SNPs with significant p-values－they found a functional SNP 
in the lymphotoxin-α (LTA) gene associated with myocardial 
infarction.  Their  GWAS  was  quite  primitive  by  current 
standards. They used only ∼100,000 SNPs from the JSNP 
database, because in those days, the number of genes was 
considered to be ∼100,000, and basically, one gene is expec-
ted to be covered by one SNP. Both of these assumptions 
have been subsequently disproven by the HGP [10] and the 
HapMap Project [11]. The coverage of the genome in the 
GWAS was low, because the success rate for this genotyping 
was only 71%. The estimated power (β value) for detection 
of a locus was also low, because the number of subjects was 
very small. However, the basic idea for the current GWAS, 
including linkage disequilibrium mapping for identifying the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  4,  2012

most associated SNPs and a pooled control strategy, were 
already  present  in  the  frontier  study.  Their  study  clearly 
showed  that  the  GWAS  was  a  reality,  not  the  dream  of 
statistical  geneticists,  and  that  a  denser  map  of  common 
SNPs was indispensable for realizing the dream.

HapMap 

Completion of human genome sequencing was announ-
ced on April 2003. Reading of 99% of the gene-containing 
part of the human sequence was finished to 99.99% accuracy 
[10]. However, in a true sense, the human genome sequence 
had (and has) not been finished. There are still many gaps in 
the “reference” sequence－for example, in the centromeres－ 
and  given  the  variation  of  the  human  genome  sequence, 
many must wonder what the completion of sequencing the 
human genome is in the first place.

After completion of the sequencing of the human genome, 
our center, SRC, joined The International HapMap Project 
from its start. The project was launched in October 2002 to 
create a public, genome-wide database of common human 
sequence variations, providing information needed as a guide 
to genetic studies of clinical phenotypes [2]. The HapMap 
Project is a natural extension of the HGP. While the reference 
sequence  of  the  genome  constructed  by  the  HGP  is  in-
formative about the vast majority of bases that are invariant 
across  individuals,  HapMap  focuses  on  DNA  sequence 
differences  among  individuals.  The  main  genome  resear-
chers in the world got together and made an infrastructure of 
the association study－i.e., a database of 1 million genetic 
variations for 4 representative populations: Africans, Euro-
pean Caucasian, Chinese, and Japanese. The Africans were 
the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria. The European Cau-
casians were a Utah, USA population with Northern and 
Western European ancestry collected in 1980 by the Centre 
d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH). The Chinese 
consisted of unrelated Han Chinese in Beijing, China. The 
Japanese  were  unrelated  self-identified  Japanese  living  in 
Tokyo, Japan. In the HapMap Project, we are proud to say 
that SRC made the World No. 1 contribution as a research 
group by genotyping ∼1/4 of the genome (Table 1). 

HapMap  data  document  the  generality  of  hotspots  of 
recombination, a block-like structure of linkage disequili-
brium and low  haplotype diversity,  leading to  substantial 
correlations  of  SNPs  with  many  of  their  neighbors  [11]. 
There  is  the  extensive  redundancy  among  nearby  SNPs, 
providing  the  potential  to  extract  extensive  information 
about genomic variation without complete re-sequencing, as 
well  as  efficiencies  through  selection  of  tag  SNPs  and 
optimized association analyses.

Fig.  1.  Structure  of  genome-wide  association  study.  It  consists  of  3  steps:  phenotyping  (recruitment  of  cases  and  controls),  genotyping 
(typing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] of individual subjects), and mapping (statistical analysis to determine linkage disequilibrium
block). 

Gold Rush

After HapMap, GWAS became as easy as expected and 
intended; to perform a GWAS, we just collect DNA from 
patients, genotype it by using commercial arrays, and do a bit 
of statistics for the results (actually, in most cases, commer-
cial companies do it for us as a business) (Fig. 1). Genotyping 
has  become  work,  not  research;  commercial  genotyping 
systems  have  spread  all  over  the  world.  By  sharing  the 
controls, collecting controls is no longer necessary, except 
for diseases with extraordinary high prevalence (＞10%). A 
huge  number  of  susceptibility  genes  are  mapped  by  this 
‘easy’ method. As a consequence, after HapMap, as commer-

cial  genotyping  systems  (Illumina,  etc.)  have  spread,  the 
association study has spread all over the world. 

As a result, a gold rush has come [1]. The study of genetic 
polymorphisms (SNP, copy number variation, etc.) with its 
application  to  disease  studies  was  selected  for  the  No.  1 
scientific event in the year 2007 [12]. Naturally, the appli-
cation refers to the identification of susceptibility genes for 
common diseases by GWAS. You must have seen (and are 
still seeing) so many GWAS papers in good journals, which 
have  reported  susceptibility  genes  for  so  many  common 
diseases,  including  obesity,  hypertension,  diabetes,  and 
osteoporosis. For example, Nature Genetics is one of the top 
journals in the field of genetics, with an impact factor in 2010 

222

of 36.377, and in that year, it published a total of 181 papers, 
of which 56% was GWAS-related. So, for the journal, the 
genetic study is almost equal to the association study.

There came such a big wave of medical science, and of 
course, we got on the wave. We did so many GWASs that 
were the first for diseases, including GWASs for osteoar-
thritis [13], rheumatoid arthritis [14], and diabetic nephro-
pathy [15]. The big wave has also spread to East Asia. Many 
good GWAS papers have been published from Korea and 
China as fruit of this international collaboration [16-18].

End  of  Beginning:  Common  Problems  of 
GWASs

Good days are ending, however. Today, the initial enthu-
siasm for GWASs is decreasing, and the GWAS society is 
facing severe criticisms. A frequent complaint is that GWAS 
results  mean  little  to  patients  due  to  the  small  effect  of 
variants on disease risk and their relatively small contribu-
tion  to  common  disease  etiology.  This  claim  might  be 
partially correct. In the first place, “significantly associated” 
does not mean that the association identified by the study is 
significant in biology, medicine, or actual life. For example, a 
paper reported the identification of a SNP that is associated 
with height, but its estimated additive effect is only 0.44 cm 
on height [19]. Another example of dubious significance is a 
GWAS study claiming that cartilage thickness of the hip joint 
measured  on  X-ray  films  is  decreased  in  subjects  with  a 
susceptibility  allele;  they  have  a  0.07-mm  (not  cm!)  nar-
rower joint space than those who do not have the allele [20]. 
However, the low risk (low odds ratio) is not always due to 
the  GWAS  itself.  In  many  studies,  it  is  the  problem  of 
particular studies themselves, not of the GWAS. For exam-
ples, using pooled controls of general populations as con-
trols  of  highly  prevalent  diseases,  like  diabetes  mellitus, 
hypertension, and obesity, must decrease the odds ratio of 
the  susceptibility  alleles  because  of  contamination  of  the 
patients  in  the  controls.  Also,  ambiguous  definition  of 
populations, like “UK Caucasians” or “Western Europeans,” 
would  compromise  the  result  by  admixture  of  different 
ethnic subgroups. Thus, it is necessary to detect population 
stratification prior to association analysis.

Moreover, a GWAS is not a method to conclude some-
thing. It’s a method to map the gene: an associated variant is 
not necessarily a true causal variant. GWASs present can-
didates  of  the  causal  variant.  To  identify  and  prove  the 
causality, we need to find the best associated variations by 
fine  mapping  around  the  smoking  gun  GWAS  signal, 
followed by functional studies for them. Statistics must lead 
to biology. Biology must lead to medicine. It is true that after 
all, no treatment, no benefit, to the patients has been given

for common diseases from GWAS results so far. My com-
ment is not intended to look down on GWASs. It is a method 
to start something; it gives us wonderful start points. You 
can start the work based on the reality of the disease-clinical 
evidence (patient, clinical record) from the human evidence 
in front of you-to the patients at your bedside.

Another problem is that not infrequently, the interpreta-
tion  of  the  ‘mapping’  results  is  wrong.  In  many  studies, 
authors just make a story for causality by relating to known 
genes near the marker SNPs, even if they are far apart on the 
genome.  The  association  does  not  tell  which  gene  is 
implicated; it just tells which sequence variation is wrong. 
Some of the readers might be thinking that all genes have 
already been discovered by the international genome project. 
This is totally wrong. There are still many more genes that 
have not been identified. For example, we have found a novel 
susceptibility gene, DVWA, that is associated with osteoar-
thritis [21]. DVWA was in a gene desert region when we first 
found it in 2004. While we were working on cloning it [21, 
22], a computer-predicted gene was mapped to the region; 
however, the prediction was a mess. The number of coding 
exons was predicted to be 19, while it was actually 3. Only 1 
in 7 experimentally determined exons of DVWA had been 
correctly predicted regarding the exon-intron boundary and 
coding region (Fig. 2). We also found a novel susceptibility 
gene for osteoporosis, FONG [23], which was not predicted 
correctly in the public database. GWASs can be a starting 
point to find a hidden gene in the genome, and we should 
remember  that  now,  the  concept  of  the  “gene”  itself  is 
changing. We have already known that there are so many 
non-protein-coding  genes:  the  genes  encoding  functional 
RNAs [24]. They are quite compatible to the original con-
cept of the gene: information in the genome that determines 
phenotype or trait. To code proteins is just one of the many 
ways to determine phenotype.

Still  Other  Problems  of  GWASs:  Lesson 
Learned for the Future

GWASs have so many false positives. p ＜ 10－2 (1% sig-

nificance level) means a 1 in 100 coincidence. If you try 1,000 
times,  you  can  hit  10  targets  and  100,000  times,  1,000 
targets－all quite by chance. Therefore, association needs 
replication, but repeating in the same population is not a 
good idea; it might just introduce the same error in the first 
study,  which  is  sometimes  difficult  to  detect.  Studies  in 
different populations, preferably in populations from diffe-
rent ethnic groups, are desirable. Because one population is 
one experiment of nature, one ethnic group is one experi-
ment  given  from  heaven.  Every  experiment  is  precious. 
Multiple  replications  in  large  samples  provide  the  most 
straightforward  path  for  identifying  robust  and  broadly 
relevant associations. International collaboration is neces-
sary. For international replication, East Asia has a definite 
advantage when we consider its relative genetic similarity 
among the subpopulations, large population size, and high 
medical standard of the countries in the area.

Real Value of GWASs

Currently, most people look at GWASs as a method to 
identify a marker for genetic diagnosis and risk assessment. 
Yes, by knowing the genetic risk, we can re-evaluate and 
modify our lifestyle and prevent unhappy problems, like side 
effects of drugs. However, GWASs could give us far sweeter 
fruit. Through functional analysis of a gene and its associated 
variants, we can approach the mechanism of the disease. By 
studying the meaning of allelic differences of causal variants, 
we can clarify the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. 
With  the  knowledge  of  the  pathogenesis,  we  can  walk 
directly to develop innovative treatments and discover new 
drugs (Fig. 3). Therefore, identification of the significantly 
associated SNP is just ‘end of the beginning’ to get to the 
final  goal:  treatment  of  patients  with  common  diseases. 

Fig.  3.  Real  value  of  genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS).  A 
GWAS  is  useful  for  diagnosis  and  treatment. 

However, at present, after identification of ‘marker’ SNPs by 
GWASs,  we  have  no  golden  road  to  find  ‘causal’  SNPs 
(variants).  We  have  no  customized  method  to  identify 
functional variants. There is still a long and winding road 
before us. It’s just the beginning.
