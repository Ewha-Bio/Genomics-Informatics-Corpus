The large amount of data on cancer genome research has contributed to our understanding of cancer biology. Indeed, the 
genomics approach has a strong advantage for analyzing multi-factorial and complicated problems, such as cancer. It is time 
to think about the actual usage of cancer genomics in the clinical field. The clinical cancer field has lots of unmet needs in the 
management of cancer patients, which has been defined in the pre-genomic era. Unmet clinical needs are not well known to 
bioinformaticians and even non-clinician cancer scientists. A personalized approach in the clinical field will bring potential 
additional challenges to cancer genomics, because most data to now have been population-based rather than individual- 
based. We can maximize the use of cancer genomics in the clinical field if cancer scientists, bioinformaticians, and clinicians 
think and work together in solving unmet clinical needs. In this review, we present one imaginary case of a cancer patient, 
with which we can think about unmet clinical needs to solve with cancer genomics in the diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, 
monitoring the status of cancer, and personalized treatment decision.

Introduction

Despite the explosive increase in cancer genomics data, 
the  actual  application  of  genomics  data  and  approach  to 
clinics offers big challenges [1, 2]. The main reason for the 
delay in the application to clinics is non-connectivity bet-
ween  bioinformaticians,  non-clinical  scientists,  and  clini-
cians. Clinicians are not confident in how much additional 
information might be given through genomics technology 
compared to conventional tools, and non-clinical scientists 
and bioinformaticians are not aware of what clinical pro-
blems should be solved with priority.

Cancer clinicians expect novel diagnostic, prognostic, and 
therapeutic  values  of  this  new  technology  [1].  Now,  the 
clinical  field  is  aware  that  multiple  assays  using  next- 
generation  sequencing  (NGS)  has  some  advantage  over 
single genetic tests [1, 3]. A recent cancer guideline from the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) pointed 
out that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or 

anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) testing should be con-
ducted  as  part  of  multiplex/NGS  in  non-small-cell  lung 
cancer (NSCLC) [4].

The feasibility of an NGS diagnostic platform at cancer 
clinics was validated by cancer centers in the United States 
[5]  and  Europe  [6].  One  platform  showed  that  potential 
hurdles, time, cost, purity, and ethical problems could be 
overcome in implementing NGS using low-coverage whole- 
genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and 
whole-transcriptome sequencing [5]. Another platform se-
quenced  clinical  samples,  including  formalin-fixed,  paraf-
fin-embedded  ones,  and  showed  that  this  approach  is 
practical and can give some benefits to the patients with lung 
cancer [6].

The WES approach in Mendelian disorders showed that 
~25% of sequencing can give a specific diagnosis based on 
the germline genetic make-up from the data of 250 probands, 
mostly consisting of neurological phenotypes in real practice 
[7].

The  clinical  application  of  cancer  genomics  should  be 
considered  in  the  context  of  unmet  clinical  needs  to 
maximize the value of this novel paradigm. Here, we dealt 
with the potential clinical application of cancer genomics in 
the aspect of practical management of cancer patients, along 
with a clinical scenario covering the whole course of cancer 
management.  We  overviewed  the  potential  of  cancer 
genomics in the context of real cancer practice through this 
approach.

Application  of  Cancer  Genomics  for  Diag-
nosis

A 64-year-old male presented with a cough since 2 months ago. 
He quit smoking 10 years ago and had smoked an average of one pack 
per day for 30 years. He had regular check-ups every year and had the 
last check-up with no abnormality 6 months ago. His chest roen-
tgenogram showed a mass shadow in the lung. He got a percutaneous 
needle aspiration (PCNA) and biopsy but did not have any tumor 
cells. He repeated the PCNA and biopsy but developed pneumo-
thorax (air leakage from lung) related to the diagnostic procedure. 
His  second  biopsy  showed  some  malignant  cells,  suggestive  of 
adenocarcinoma. After a staging work-up with a computed tomo-
graphy (CT) scan, positron-emission tomography (PET) scan, brain 
magnetic resonance imaging scan, and bronchoscopy, his tumor was 
revealed as T2N0 clinical stage. He got a surgery based on the result 
of the pathology and staging work-up.

In this situation, we face unmet clinical needs of early 
cancer diagnosis. He was diagnosed with symptoms related 
to the cancer, despite his regular check-up. If we detect his 
malignancy before the symptoms, we can get a better result 
compared with the symptomatic case [8]. This imaginary 
patient was diagnosed with operable cancer, but as many as 
60%  to  70%  of  lung  cancer  patients  are  diagnosed  with 
inoperable,  advanced  disease  [9].  To  diagnose  the  cancer 
sooner, screening procedures have been studied extensively 
in the clinical field. Lots of trials failed to show an actual 
benefit of screening strategy in lung cancer [10, 11], but 
recently, a screening trial using low-dose chest CT of lung 
cancer was proven to be successful [8]. Low-dose chest CT 
reduced  the  mortality  from  lung  cancer  through  early 
detection in people with a history of at least 30 pack-years of 
smoking. Despite this good approach to detect early lung 
cancer, the reduction of mortality is 20% [8]. This advantage 
should  be  counterbalanced  with  the  potential  harmful 
effects of radiation exposure or false positivity [12].

One  important  usage  of  genomics  should  be  early 
detection. Many biomarkers were investigated for the early 
detection  of  lung  cancer－for  example,  circulating  tumor 
DNA and RNA [13]. But, false positivity and false negativity 
of single tests prevent these tests from clinical usage. If we 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

use  multiple  biomarkers  using  cancer  genomics  for  the 
detection of early cancer, the false positives and negatives 
could be reduced to the level of clinical usage.

Another effective approach of early diagnosis of cancer is 
to select a high-risk population for screening tests. Many 
genome-wide association studies identified some germline 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) that are associated 
with  the risk of cancers  [14-16], and these  findings  sug-
gested important potential germline markers for the defi-
nition of high-risk populations. Dr. Mardis told the case of 
Mike  Snyder  as  an  example  of  an  actual  application  of  a 
germline genome test [17]. He sequenced his own genome 
and found a higher risk of type 2 diabetes; since that time, he 
checked  his  glucose  level  regularly,  and  he  detected  high 
glucose levels at the very beginning. After that, he exercised 
regularly and returned to normal glucose levels. The concept 
of  early  diagnosis,  like  the  story  of  Mike  Snyder,  can  be 
applied to the early detection of cancer, too. If we define a 
high-risk population with germline genetic tests, we could 
focus on the use of screening tests in this population. This 
approach will also save money on screening tests for the 
whole population.

This patient had a bad experience of pneumothorax. This 
complication gives pain and discomfort of the sensation of 
dyspnea, prolongs the period of admission, and increases the 
cost of cancer management. This problem originated from 
the invasive nature of the diagnostic procedure－PCNA and 
biopsy using a needle, moving back and forth through the 
patient’s  fragile  lung  tissue.  New  diagnostic  tools  using 
cancer genomics－for example, identification of cancer-spe-
cific genetic alterations from circulating tumor DNA－can 
avoid this type of complication from invasive procedures. 
One pioneering study showed that circulating tumor DNA 
could be combined with genomic technology to diagnose and 
monitor the status of cancer very safely [18].

Application  of  Cancer  Genomics  for  Prog-
nosis 

He underwent surgery performed by thoracic surgeons. His final 
pathological  diagnosis  was  adenocarcinoma  and  revealed  the 
involvement of some mediastinal lymph nodes; therefore, the final 
pathological stage was T2N2, IIIA. This stage required adjuvant 
chemotherapy, and he was referred to the department of medical 
oncology. A medical oncologist prescribed adjuvant chemotherapy－
a navelbine and cisplatin regimen (NP) for 4 cycles.

NP 4 cycles has been prescribed to patients with high-risk 
clinical stage IB, IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB, regardless of other 
clinicopathological  factors.  The  actual  benefit  from  this 
treatment is only a 4% long-term survival advantage, with 
some hematological and non-hematological toxicities [19, 

www.genominfo.org

SH  Lee,  et  al.  Clinical  Application  of  Cancer  Genomics

20]. The way to improve the risk-to-benefit ratio of adjuvant 
treatment is further selection of a patient population that 
could benefit from this treatment. Stage-based risk calcu-
lation－the current practice－cannot predict an accurate risk 
of relapse and attenuates the value of adjuvant treatment. 
Single  patient-based  risk  calculation  should  be  done  to 
identify the adequate patients for adjuvant treatment. Can-
cer genomics will provide useful tools for a single patient- 
based  risk  calculation  model.  This  personalized  adjuvant 
model will definitely increase the proportion of patients who 
benefit from it.

There are also clinical needs of prognosis prediction even 
before  surgery.  Surgical  management  of  stage  IIIA  is 
controversial.  If  he  had  been  diagnosed  as  stage  IIIA 
preoperatively, he might have chosen a no-surgery option, 
such  as  concurrent  chemoradiation,  because  no  definite 
benefit  of surgery  was  demonstrated until now, although 
this is controversial [21, 22]. We have relatively sensitive 
diagnostic  methods,  such  as  CT,  PET,  and  endobronchial 
ultrasonography, but the sensitivity and specificity are still 
not perfect. One focus of genomics technology should be a 
more accurate prognosis preoperatively, in addition to post-
operatively.

Prediction  issues  in  cancer  patients  are  not  limited  to 
survival, recurrence, and response to specific treatment. The 
goal of cancer care is improvement of survival and, more 
importantly, quality of life. Predictive markers of bone meta-
stasis or bone-related events, such as fracture or paralysis, 
are very important to improve the quality of life in cancer 
patients. We have no clinically validated markers to predict 
these  events  [23].  An  unbiased  approach  is  needed  to 
discover good biomarker for these events, because we have 
very limited clues to dig into these problems. The most im-
portant  advantage  of  genomics  approach  is  that  is 
“unbiased” with regard to any hypotheses or theories. That 
is why clinical problems with low-depth knowledge are a 
good candidate for the application of cancer genomics. The 
connection between clinicians and genomic scientists can 
facilitate  the  development  of  clinical  problems  that  are 
solved with a genomic approach.

Application  of  Cancer  Genomics  for  Moni-
toring

He got 4 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy and then followed up 
regularly with a physical examination, blood test, CT scan, and/or 
PET scan. At 6 months since the completion of adjuvant chemo-
therapy, he presented with right-side chest pain, and his CT scan 
showed  tumor relapse in the  right  lung  and  pleura. He  planned 
systemic anticancer treatment for life prolongation and palliation of 
symptom, not curative.

The role of CT scan and/or PET scan is not defined [24], 
but many clinicians use this high-cost image for monitoring 
relapse.  The  reason  for  the  popular  use  of  this  high-cost 
image  is  that  there  is  no  other  alternative  of  monitoring 
cancer status. Recent studies showed the possibility of cir-
culating tumor cell and cell-free DNA as a tool for moni-
toring  tumor  status  [18,  25].  Cancer  genomics  enables 
circulating  tumor  cell  or  cell-free  DNA  to  detect  relapse 
earlier than image findings or tumor markers. The delicate 
delineation of circulating DNA with NGS technologies is an 
essential part of this success story. No tool is available with 
a  definite  clinical  benefit  for  the  monitoring  of  cancer; 
therefore, we absolutely need new, non-invasive tools for it. 
Because it takes at least several years to prove the benefit of 
monitoring,  we  should  start  a  well-designed  prospective 
study using cancer genomics to prove it as soon as possible.

Application of Cancer Genomics for Thera-
peutics

The medical oncologist who was in charge of him tested for EGFR 
mutation  and  ALK  by  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  to  see 
rearrangements of ALK. Tests showed no EGFR mutation and no 
ALK translocation. He chose cytotoxic chemotherapy with peme-
trexed and cisplatin according to the double-negative results of the 
EGFR and ALK tests.

The  ultimate  goal  of  the  clinical  application  of  cancer 
genomics should be therapeutics. There are increasing gene 
lists for NSCLC that have matching targeted agents [26, 27], 
but many patients do not have genetic alterations that can be 
a target. Even for the same type of cancer－for example, lung 
adenocarcinoma－the genetic make-up is very heterogene-
ous. The accurate definition of the genetic make-up of each 
patient will be the first step for personalized medicine. Many 
target  panels  have  been  developed  by  many  vendors  and 
hospitals for commercial or non-commercial use [3], but the 
usage is still very limited. As more cancer genome data are 
available [28, 29], the list of target panels will increase and 
be specified to tumor types.

Now, we have two targeted agents to prolong the survival 
of lung cancer patients: the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) erlotinib or gefitinib for EGFR mutations and the ALK 
TKI crizotinib for ALK translocations. For this case, there 
was no targeted agent, because he did not have EGFR or ALK 
alterations.  Based  on  the  histology  of  his  tumor,  he  was 
treated  with  pemetrexed  and  cisplatin  [30].  Despite  the 
substantial  toxicity  of  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  many  pa-
tients  are  prescribed  these  drugs  with  the  individualized 
possibility of this agent not known. This decision relies on 
population data from large-scale prospective trials. Because 
clinical trials targeting specific genetic alterations are increa-

176

sing, the clinical need for more genetic information is also 
increasing [31].

If  the  patient  was  diagnosed  as  stage  IV  initially,  the 
amount  of  tissue  for  genetic  testing  is  very  limited.  The 
amount of tissue is enough for 2 or 3 genetic tests. For these 
patients, multiplexing or NGS technologies have important 
advantages to overcome the limitation of tissue amounts in 
the clinic.

This patient got adjuvant chemotherapy with NP for 4 
cycles but progressed 6 months after the completion. We 
guess that the patient did not benefit from NP for 4 cycles. 
The usual speculation is whether there is a better way to 
choose adjuvant treatment. The way to increase the benefit 
of adjuvant treatment could be the application of variable 
adjuvant  treatment  that  is  selected  from  individualized 
factors.  Personalized  cancer  genomic  analysis  can  show 
different  and  private  profiles  of  individual  cancers,  and 
accumulation  of  these  genomic  data  enables  different 
adjuvant treatment strategies for each patient.

Despite  the  theoretical  promise  of  personalized  cancer 
genomic analysis for the selection of the right drug, there are 
few examples of this direct application of cancer genomics. 
One of important example is the story of Lukas Wartman, a 
doctor  at  Washington  University  in  St.  Louis  [32].  He 
suffered  from  a  second  relapse  of  acute  lymphoblastic 
leukemia  and  sequenced  the  tumor  DNA  and  RNA.  He 
found very high expression of FLT3 and then figured out that 
sunitinib, a kidney cancer drug, could block tumor survival 
signals. Sunitinib induced complete remission in him, and 
thereafter, he received allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
and is now in remission. Another story from the Fox Chase 
Cancer Center was reported on KIT mutations from a pan-
creatic  neuroendocrine  tumor  [33].  The  patient  had  an 
advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor and sequenced 
his tumor using a cancer panel. He had a KIT mutation and 
was treated with imatinib, a well-known KIT inhibitor that is 
not approved for his tumor, for more than 2 years. If he had 
been in in routine practice without cancer panel sequencing, 
he would have died without imatinib treatment.

A pharmacogenomic approach could be used to minimize 
toxicity to cancer treatment, too. In this case, we usually see 
germline SNP data. Some germline SNPs are already known 
to predict erratic side effects to specific drugs. One example 
is the UGT1A1 germline polymorphism for the metabolism 
and toxicity of irinotecan. If the patient has a homozygous 
polymorphism in the UGT1A1 gene－the *28 variant－he 
should be prescribed with a dose reduction to avoid severe, 
sometimes fatal, toxicity from irinotecan. A genomic appro-
ach  is  required  to  properly  assess  pharmacogenomics  in 
association  with  drug  toxicity.  A  commercial  chip,  the 
Affymetric  DMET  chip,  covers  25‒32%  of  genes  of  phar-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

macogenomics,  and  it  is  an  important  question  whether 
more coverage with WES will be more beneficial.

He was treated with pemetrexed and cisplatin for 4 cycles, and his 
tumor shrank with the treatment. But, his tumor rebounded, with a 
complaint of dyspnea and cough, 4 months after the completion of 
treatment.  After  4  cycles  of  second-line  chemotherapy  with 
docetaxel, he had stable disease.

Even in the case of a dramatic response to the first-line 
treatment, nearly all cancers rebound with various relapse- 
free durations [30, 34]. The choice of second-line treatment 
depends on clinical guidelines, clinical parameters, and clini-
cians’ experiences. Any of the parameters may not be best if 
a specific patient’s situation is not considered. We do not 
know  the  exact  mechanism  of  resistance  to  the  previous 
treatment  and  do  not  have  any  good  way  to  assess  the 
mechanism of resistance. If cancer genomics is adopted in 
this  situation,  we  can  profile  the  tumor  tissue  that  was 
resistant  to  the  previous  treatment.  The  profile  can  help 
clinicians  decide  on  a  second-line  treatment  option  and 
improve the individual’s outcome. The resistance mecha-
nism  could  vary,  depending  on  multidimensional  factors, 
such as the patient, tumor biology, and previous treatment. 
Especially, this situation should be approached individually 
with the concept of true personalized medicine.

His disease began to grow again and he refused further cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. He was in hospice care and died 1 year after the initial 
diagnosis of relapse. After his death, his tumor was sequenced by 
whole-transcriptome  analysis,  and  his  tumor  showed  a  ROS1 
translocation. Now, a ROS1 inhibitor is available for this type of 
cancer.

The  median  overall  survival  of  metastatic  lung  cancer 
patients is 1 year if there is no genetic alteration for which 
targeted agents are available [30, 34], as in this case. If the 
patient  has  an  EGFR-sensitive  mutation  or  ALK  translo-
cation, the median overall survival time reaches 2 years [35, 
36]. A ROS1 targeting agent, another example of successful 
targeting of oncogene addiction, is now available after his 
death  [27].  If  the  ROS1  translocation  was  known  for  his 
tumor and he was treated with a ROS1 inhibitor, he could 
have a chance to live an additional one year or more. Tumors 
have  very  heterogeneous  profiles  [37,  38],  and  resistant 
tumors have even more heterogeneous ones [39]. This is 
why tumors should ultimately be approached on an indi-
vidual basis, rather than a population basis.

Conclusion

Now is the right  time to think  about how  we can use 
cancer genomics for individual patients. There are still lots of 
technological  hurdles－e.g.,  functional  annotation  of  se-
quencing  results,  the  way  to  integrate  multi-dimensional 

www.genominfo.org

data,  and  the  exploration  of  the  clinical  meaning  of  se-
quencing  variants  for  the  routine  clinical  usage  of cancer 
genomics. Defining unmet clinical needs is as important as 
overcoming technological hurdles to maximize the benefit 
from cancer genomics. Early detection, non-invasive mole-
cular diagnosis, risk prediction of relapse and tumor-related 
events, monitoring of disease status, matching good drugs, 
and finding out personal grade resistance mechanisms are 
good examples of unmet clinical needs that should be solved 
with cancer genomics. It would speed up and optimize the 
application of genomics to cancer clinics if cancer biologists, 
bioinformaticians, and cancer clinicians cooperate towards 
one goal of achieving it.
