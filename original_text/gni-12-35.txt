Single-nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) have  been emerging out of the  efforts to research human diseases and ethnic 
disparities.  A  semantic  network  is  needed  for  in-depth  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  SNPs,  because  phenotypes  are 
modulated by complex networks, including biochemical and physiological pathways. We identified ethnicity-specific SNPs by 
eliminating overlapped SNPs from HapMap samples, and the ethnicity-specific SNPs were mapped to the UCSC RefGene lists. 
Ethnicity-specific genes were identified as follows: 22 genes in the USA (CEU) individuals, 25 genes in the Japanese (JPT) 
individuals,  and  332  genes  in  the  African  (YRI)  individuals.  To  analyze  the  biologically  functional  implications  for 
ethnicity-specific SNPs, we focused on constructing a semantic network model. Entities for the network represented by 
“Gene,”  “Pathway,”  “Disease,”  “Chemical,”  “Drug,”  “ClinicalTrials,”  “SNP,”  and  relationships  between  entity-entity  were 
obtained  through  curation.  Our  semantic  modeling  for  ethnicity-specific  SNPs  showed  interesting  results  in  the  three 
categories,  including  three  diseases  (“AIDS-associated  nephropathy,”  “Hypertension,”  and  “Pelvic  infection”),  one  drug 
("Methylphenidate"),  and  five  pathways  ("Hemostasis,”  “Systemic  lupus  erythematosus,”  “Prostate  cancer,”  “Hepatitis  C 
virus,” and “Rheumatoid arthritis”). We found ethnicity-specific genes using the semantic modeling, and the majority of our 

findings was consistent with the previous studies ― that an understanding of genetic variability explained ethnicity-specific 

disparities.

Introduction

Tremendous efforts have been made to identify ethnicity- 
specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human 
diseases [1, 2]. Dosage effect or disease susceptibility is not 
equal among ethnic groups. Type 2 diabetes prevalence is 
12.8%, 8.4%, and 6.6% in non-Hispanic blacks, in Mexican- 
Americans,  and  in  non-Hispanic  whites  aged  20  years  or 
older [3]. Ethnic differences were causes of environmental 
exposure and experiences with health care, and these ethnic 
disparities likely influence different outcomes in people with 
certain diseases [4]. Genetic differences also cannot ignore 
its important role in determining ethnic disparities. Despite 
recent advances in the genetic studies for ethnic disparities, 
little is known about how ethnic genetic differences con-
tribute to inter-ethnic disparities in disease risk or disease- 
related complex traits [5].

Recently,  semantic  modeling  has  gained  attention  as  a 
powerful tool for organizing and integrating biological big 
data  [6].  Semantic  technology  is  needed  to  provide  the 
knowledge to gain an adequate interpretation of integrated 
biological systems [7]. Recent advances in ontology deve-
lopment,  like  semantic  modeling,  are  considered  to  con-
tribute  to  the  next-generation  approach  by  enabling  the 
researcher  to  actually  ask  scientific  questions  instead  of 
constructing complicated databases for scientific questions 
and answers [8]. This combination of data integration and 
visualization could provide important insights into hetero-
geneous data on millions of genes, chemical compounds, 
diseases, and pathways [9, 10]. 

To model a semantic network, the BioXM software is a 
customizable  knowledge  management  program  for  large 
scientific data, and the latest solution is designed to provide 
meaningful interactions through graphical browsing [11].

HY  Kim,  et  al.  Semantic  Modeling  for  Ethnicity-Specific  SNPs

Through  an  advanced  query  builder,  the  knowledge  con-
sisting of many different and connected queries is flexibly 
examined. In this way, models for a research project can be 
constructed and extended effectively. Many data modeling 
studies and software developments have been advanced, but 
there are relatively few studies using semantic modeling for 
ethnicity-specific SNPs. 

To evaluate the ethnic disparities, in the current study, we 
identified  ethnicity-specific  SNPs  for  three  populations, 
including North Americans with European ancestry (CEU), 
Japanese from Tokyo (JPT), and Yorubans from Ibadan (YRI) 
from  HapMap,  and  constructed  a  semantic  model  for 
ethnicity-specific  SNPs.  We  expect  that  semantic  model- 
based  research  will  provide  valuable  information  on 
ethnicity-specific gene-based SNPs and strongly affect useful 
knowledge in ethnic disparities.

Methods
Study subjects

We  downloaded  the  SNPs  data  from  Haplotype  Map 
(HapMap)  phase  3  (http://www.hapmap.org)  for  CEU 
(Utah  residents  with  Northern  and  Western  European 
ancestry), JPT (Japanese in Tokyo, Japan), and YRI (Yoruba 
in  Ibadan,  Nigeria).  We  focused  on  the  gene-based  SNP 
associations in the three ethnicities, because ethnicity is a 
highly heritable polygenic quantitative trait of biomedical 
importance.  Ethnicity-specific  SNPs  were  obtained  by 
eliminating common SNPs.

Enrichment analysis for SNP-based gene set

Ethnicity-specific HapMap SNPs were mapped to genes 
from UCSC RefGene (http://genome.ucsc.edu; ver. hg18) 
[12]. For the mapped genes, gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA) was performed using the Database for Annotation, 
Visualization,  and  Integrated  Discovery  (DAVID  ver.  6.7) 

for

process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular func-
tion (MF). The p-values were calculated for the probability of 
getting a set of genes within a given GO group.

Semantic modeling

To look for diverse interactions of ethnicity-specific SNPs, 
we constructed a semantic model using BioXM [7], which 
efficiently manages knowledge, such as complex scientific 
research data. The model provides semantic networks with 
useful  relationship  information  between  participating  en-
tities.  Our  semantic  model  consists  of  seven  entities, 
including  “Gene  [14],”  “Pathway  [14],”  “Disease  [14],” 
“Chemical  [14],”  “Drug  [15],”  “SNP  [12],”  and  “Clini-
calTrials (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)”, and 10 relations, 
including  “Pathway-Gene,”  “Disease-Pathway,”  “Disease- 
Chemical,” “Gene-Disease,” “Gene-Chemical,” “SNP-Gene,” 
“Chemical-Pathway,” “Chemical-Drug,” “ClinicalTrials-Dis-
ease,” and “Drug-ClinicalTrials.” Conversion of all data to 
entity input format was parsed using Python.

Results and Discussion
Discovery of ethnicity-specific SNPs

We  identified  ethnicity-specific  SNPs  by  eliminating 
common SNPs from HapMap samples and mapped the SNP 
positions to the UCSC RefGene lists. 22, 25, three 332 genes 
were identified in the CEU, in the JPT individuals, and in the 
YRI  individuals,  respectively  (Fig.  1).  Comparison  of  the 
three sets showed that YRI individuals had a biased order of 
SNP-based  genes.  This  result  was  a  consensus  among 
previous evolutionary findings. CEU and JPT belong to the 
same  cluster,  together  with  Amerindians  and  Australo-
papuan, while YRI belongs to a separate cluster showing the 
first  split  between  Africans  and  non-Africans  [16,  17]. 
African  populations  subdivided  from  other  sub-Saharan 
African populations, and a small subset of this population 
migrated out of Africa in the past 100,000 years. African and 
non-African populations divided in the past 40,000 years. 
Phylogenetic  analysis  of  Y  chromosomal  haplotypes, 
mtDNA, and autosomes are indicative of the longest history 
of population subdivision in Africa. Africans are the most 
ancestral  population  in  human  and  have  fewer  sites  in 
linkage disequilibrium, compared with non-African popula-
tions [18].

To  explore  the  meaningful  biological  information  of 
structural variations, we performed GSEA for the SNP-based 
genes using GO categories (BP, CC, and MF) in the DAVID 
tool. The significantly categorized functions (p ＜ 0.01) of 
SNP-based genes for YRI are shown as pie charts in Fig. 2, 
but none was significantly enriched for CEU and JPT. Six

groups  of  BP  and  four  groups  of  MF  had  significant 
enrichment score ranges of 1.67–4.85 and 7.16E-04–0.002, 
respectively.  The  top  pie  chart  in  BP  presents  G-protein- 
coupled  receptor  protein  signaling  pathway,  including 
chemotaxis, and defense response to bacterium (Fig. 2A). In 
the  enriched  region,  8%  of  BP  was  chemotaxis  (GO: 
0006935)  with  an  enrichment  score  of  3.88.  Chemotaxis 
contributes  to  enhancement  of  disease  aggressiveness  in 
African-Americans  [19].  The  MFs  that  were  significantly 
enriched  were  G-protein-coupled  receptor  activity  and 
binding,  olfactory  receptor  activity,  and  transmembrane 
receptor  activity  (Fig.  2B).  Enriched  functions  in  cellular 
components were keratin filament (GO:0045095) with an 
enrichment score of 5.86, which contained the KRTAP gene 
family  (KRTAP12-3,  KRTAP4-11,  KRT14,  KRTAP4-4, 
KRTAP9-8,  KRTAP10-7,  KRTAP10-8).  KRTAP  genes  are 
up-regulated in white hair than in black hair by a microarray 
analysis.  Immunoreactivity  for  KRTP  genes  in  white  hair 
follicles was increased compared with black hair. Therefore 
Choi et al. [20] suggested that greying hair, a sign of aging, is 
associated with hair growth rate. 

Semantic modeling for ethnicity-specific SNPs

Semantic modeling is an emerging method for compre-
hensively  understanding  complicated  BPs  and  spacious 
networks  [7].  The  continuous  production  of  increasingly 
large-scale  data  in  biology  needs  better  visualization  of 
complex and huge biological data. We constructed a seman-
tic network model in order to analyze biologically functional

implications  for  ethnicity-specific  SNPs.  Overall,  network 
entities were used, such as “Gene” (records, 46,354), “Path-
way” (records, 362), “Disease” (records, 9,647), “Chemical” 
(records, 153,021), “Drug” (records, 6,712), “ClinicalTrials” 
(records, 1,273), and “SNP” (records, 379), and pairwise 
relationships between entity-entity were curated as “Gene- 
Pathway”  (records,  46,354),  “Gene-Disease”  (records, 
18,391,755), “Gene-Chemical” (records, 308,405), “Disease- 
Chemical” (records, 401,145), “Disease-Pathway” (records, 
43,139), “Chemical-Pathway” (records, 196,073), “Chemical- 
Drug”  (records,  1,702),  “SNP-Gene”  (records,  379), 
“ClinicalTrials-Drug” (records, 1,419), and “ClinicalTrials- 
Disease”  (records,  1,210).  Entities,  including  “Pathway,” 
“Chemical,” and “Disease,” were collected from the Com-
parative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [14, 21], which is 
a  public  database  to  promote  the  understanding  of  the 
interaction  of  genes,  chemical  compounds,  and  disease 
networks  in  human  health.  Drugs  were  mapped  from 
DrugBank  [15,  22],  which  provides  detailed  drug  action 
information. We linked a novel relationship for “Chemical- 
Drug”  and  “Gene-SNP”  by  curating  the  relationship  of 
entities using Python ver. 2.6, and the remaining relations 
were collected from the CTD. Fig. 3 shows that semantic 
modeling of ethnicity-specific SNPs is dynamic and flexible. 
Hierarchy structure is where the parent can have one child, 
while  in  Directed  Acyclic  Graph  (DAG)  networks,  like 
BioXM,  the  parent  can  have  more  than  one  child.  For 
example, Gene A is associated with Chemical B or Pathway 
C. Also, Gene A is associated with Drug C, because Gene A 
is a curated interaction with Disease B, and Disease B is a 
curated association with Drug C. 

Ethnicity-specific SNPs reveals association with 3 
diseases and 1 drug

these semantic “Gene-Disease” networks, we analyzed the 
functional implications of ethnic variants. There were 123 
diseases associated with ethnicity-specific SNPs in common 
populations, 3 CEU-specific, and 46 YRI-specific, but JPT 
had no specified disparity between different ethnic popu-
lations (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Three diseases associated 
with  CEU-specific  SNPs  were  shown  as  phantom  limb 
(MESH:D010591), 
trochlear  nerve  diseases  (MESH: 
D020432), and  vulvitis (MESH:D014847), while  diseases 
associated with YRI-specific SNPs were observed, such as 
acquired  immune  deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)-associated 
nephropathy  (AIDSAN),  hypertension,  primary  amyloi-
dosis, and pelvic infection. AIDSAN (MESH:D016263) rates 
are higher in African-Americans than whites. Although the 
mortality and morbidity from AIDS infection are reduced, 
AIDSAN remains a major complication of AIDS infection 
(http://statgen.ncsu.edu/). Hypertension (MESH:C537095) 
is  a  disease  threatening the  public  health  in sub-Saharan 
Africa.  In  some  areas,  blacks  exhibit  higher  rates  of 
hypertension than whites. Increased salt intake and obesity 
are the leading causes of the prevalence of hypertension in 
Africa [26]. Pelvic infection (MESH:D034161) is a kind of 
inflammatory disease that blacks are more prone to take than 
other ethnic groups [27]. 

By  applying  the  “SNP-Gene-Disease-Chemical-Drug” 
model, 2 and 14 drugs were revealed with CEU-specific and 
YRI-specific groups, but JPT-specific drugs had no results 
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 1B). One drug (methylpheni-
date, DB00422) was reported to have ethnic disparities in 
previously drug studies. The mean dose of methylphenidate 
is about 1.5 times higher in African-Americans than whites 
[28], and its use is steadily increasing in South Africa [29]. 

Ethnicity-specific associations with 5 pathways 

Diseases and drugs are very clinically important for under-
standing ethnic disparities. Many diseases and drugs have 
been reported to be involved in ethnic disparities, disease 
susceptibility, drug response, and disposition [23-25]. We 
curated  “SNP-Gene-Disease-Chemical-Drug”  interactions 
in the semantic networks for ethnicity-specific SNPs. Using 

Analysis using the semantic model for ethnicity-specific 
SNPs identified 5, 7, and 100 CEU-specific, JPT-specific, and 
YRI-specific biochemical pathways, respectively. In hemo-
stasis (REACT:604), associated with cardiovascular disea-
ses,  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor-1  activity  levels  of 
Africans are lower compared to Caucasians. These negative

effects can be seen already at a young age. If addressed in 
early  life,  it  is  possibly  adjustable  through  behavior  and 
optimal  dietary  changes  [30].  Systemic  lupus  activity 
measure  (SLAM;  KEGG:05322)  scores  were  higher  in 
African-Americans (mean = 12.6) and Hispanics (11.0) than 
in Caucasians (8.5). It caused lack of health insurance, onset 
of  abrupt  disease,  presence  of  anti-Ro  (SSA)  antibody, 
absence of HLA-DRB, high levels of helplessness, and abnor-
mal illness behaviors. Caucasians lived under less crowded 
conditions,  had  less  abnormal  illness  behaviors,  and  had 
more education. The results of the regression analyses were 
showed significant association between higher SLAM scores 
and higher helplessness, absence of HLA-DRB1*0301, and 
presence of HLA-DRB*0201 (p ＜ 0.01) [31]. Prostate can-
cer (KEGG:05215) is a diagnosed male reproductive system 
cancer. Incidence of prostate cancer in African- American 
men is higher than in European men (1.6 times). Amun-

dadottir et al. [32] identified that the chromosomal 8q24 
region is most frequently gained in prostate cancers, and this 
gained region has been correlated with aggressive tumors 
[33].  Estimated  population  attributable  risk  is  greater  in 
Africans than in European populations. Hepatitis C virus 
(HCV; KEGG:05160) is a major cause of chronic liver disease 
in humans. Rates of HCV prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa 
are the highest in central Africa (3.0%) compared with the 
median  (2.2%).  Conjeevaram  et  al.  [34]  showed  that 
African-Americans with chronic HCV have lower response 
to interferon-based antiviral therapy than Caucasian Ame-
ricans [35]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA; KEGG:05323) is an 
autoimmune disease and may affect many organs. The RA 
prevalence in urban South Africans is similar in Caucasians 
[36]. 

In  the  current  study,  the  pathways  shared  between  all 
populations  were  signal  transduction  (REACT:111102), 

www.genominfo.org

olfactory transduction (KEGG:04740), and metabolic path-
ways  (KEGG:01100).  These  pathways  were  common 
disease-pathway interactions in previous research. Although 
ethnicity-specific genes are identified in each population, it 
is generally observed that genes that are associated with a 
trait  or  disease  can  converge  to  the  same  pathway  [37]. 
Those  genes  are  also  supposed  to  converge  to  common 
pathways  shared  between  all  populations.  Therefore,  a 
pathway-based  approach  allows  us  to  systematically  eva-
luate  multiple  polymorphic  genes  from  different  popula-
tions  with  respect  to  pathways  as  a  biological  unit  [38]. 
Moreover, the pathway-based approach has more capability 
to detect rare genetic variants with a small effect that do not 
survive at the stringent significance level [39]. 

We identified ethnicity-specific SNPs from HapMap data 
and constructed a semantic network model for the HapMap 
SNP dataset. Functional studies were analyzed with gene- 
based ethnicity-specific SNPs. Our semantic network model 
showed  robust  interactions  between  ethnic-specific  SNPs 
and  public data.  However, this  model  is still  in  the  early 
stage, and greater data connection and development of more 
flexible algorithms are required. We expect that our seman-
tic network model is useful for ethnicity-specific SNPs, and 
our findings will provide prioritization of ethnicity-specific 
gene-based SNP candidates.
