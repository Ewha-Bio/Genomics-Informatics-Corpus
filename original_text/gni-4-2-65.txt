Abstract 
Peptide mass mapping is the matching of experimentally 
generated peptides masses with the predicted masses of 
digested  proteins  contained  in  a  database.  To  identify 
proteins by matching their constituent fragment masses 
to the theoretical peptide masses generated from a protein 
database,  the peptide  mass fingerprinting  technique  is 
used for the protein identification. Thus, it is important to 
know the theoretical  mass distribution of the database. 
However, few researches have reported the peptide mass 
distribution of a database. We analyzed the peptide mass 
distribution of non-redundant protein sequence database 
in  the  NCBI  after  digestion  with  15  different  types  of 
enzymes.  In  order  to  characterize  the  peptide  mass 
distribution with different digestion enzymes, a power law 
distribution (Zipfs law) was applied to the distribution. After 
constructing  simulated digestion of a protein database, 
rank-frequency plot of peptide fragments was applied to 
generalize a Zipfs law curve for all enzymes. As a result, 
our data appear to fit Zipfs law with statistically significant 
parameter values.

Introduction 
Proteins are responsible for an organism's phenotype and 
function. Proteins can be identified using electrophoresis 
that separates proteins based on their isoelectric points 
and molecular weights on polyacrylamide gels, like two(cid:173)
dimensional  polyacrylamide-gel  electrophoresis  (2D 
PAGE)  (O'Farrell,  1975).  For  efficient  identification  of 
proteins, mass spectrometry (MS) has become the powerful

method  for  the  rapid  speed  and  characterization  of 
post-translational  modification  (Blackstock  and  Weir, 
1999). Matrix-assisted laser-desorption-ionization-time(cid:173)
of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry is usually used 
for peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) (Henzel eta/., 1993). 
The  masses  of  peptides  that  came  from  an  in-gel 
proteolytic  digestion  are  searched  against  the  protein 
sequence databases by used enzyme with cleavage rule. 
The protein sequence database was precisely digested by 
several kinds of enzymes and calculated by mass values 
of amino acids. Trypsin is usually the default enzyme and 
some proteomic programs do not include any enzyme. 
Experimental or Computational peptide values are 'average' 
or 'monoisotopic' mass as ratio of isotope. 

Zipfs  law (Zipf,  1949) ·is the  word  usage  in  natural 
languages,  which  follows  a  power-law  function  as  a 
rank-frequency distribution.  If each word of a language 
has  a  frequency  in  a  large  corpus,  and  them  the  list 
words in  order of their frequency of occurrence, we can 
observe  the  relationship  between  the  frequency  of  a 
word  1and its position in the list as rank  r(Manning and 
Schutze,  1999). There is a constant k such as 1 ·  r=  k 
Zipfs plot was exhibited linguistic, social, economic data 
should be a straight line with slope -1. The abundances 
of expressed gene follow a  power-law distribution with 
an exponent close to -1  in the SAGE (Serial Analysis of 
Gene Expression) data (Furusawa and  Kaneko, 2003). 
Protein domains were  ranked  by the frequency of their 
connectivity and then found that the curve is similar to a 
generalized Zipfs law curve in the Prosite, ProDom and 
Pfam  domain  databases (Wuchty,  2001 ).  It was found 
that highly connected Inter Pro domains were observed 
in the five organisms using topology of domain networks. 
Mantegna  (Mantegna,  et a/.,  1994)  reported  that  the 
noncoding regions are more similar to natural languages 
that  the  coding  region  of  DNA  Distribution  of  RNA 
secondary structures for several lengths also good fitted 
into the power-law distribution. 

Zipfs  law  derived  from  the  word  usage  in  natural 
language  and  was  applied  to  cultural  sciences,  but 
biological  data  also  has  been  followed  rank-frequency 
distribution  by  several  studies.  We  performed  that 
peptide  fragments  were  obtained  from  non-redundant 
protein  sequence  database  in  NCBI  and  digested 
protein sequences with  15 enzymes.  After constructing 
simulated digestion of a protein database, rank-frequency

plot of peptide fragments was able to generalize the Zipfs 
law curve for all enzymes. 

Materials and Methods 
Non-redundant protein database were downloaded from 
NCBI  (National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information) 
website  (ftp://ftp. ncbi. nih.gov/blast/db/FAST AI).  All 
3,154,491  fasta  sequences  were  subjected  to  digest 
using enzymes. Enzymes and cleavage rules were listed 
up in Table 1. Fifteen digested peptide fragment database 
by  enzymes were  assigned  ranks  and  frequencies  by 
mass  of  fragments.  We  can  explore  the  relationship 
between the frequency of a domain f and its position in the 
list, known as its rank r. f  · r = k, where k is constant. The 
relationship is described by a power-law that f  means the 
frequency  of size of peptide fragment and  x  is  rank of 
determined from this frequency in the equation f  = ax -b 
or logj =log a - blogx. Rank-frequency plot usually shows 
a straight line on doubly logarithmic axes. We examined 
fitness of power-law distribution using linear regression 

model because equation of logj =log a- blogx is same as 
typical form of regression model (y =ax+ f3 + c). This is 
easily  achieved  using  regression  model  on  the  loge 
frequency versus loge rank transformed data. The term c 
represents the unpredicted or unexplained variation in the 
response variable;  it is conventionally called  the "error 
term" whether it is really a measurement error or not. The 
error term is conventionally assumed to have expected 
value equal to zero, as a nonzero expected value could be 
absorbed into a. We estimated a, (3  parameter values in 
the plot of Zipfs law using the least square method and 
examined  whether  parameter  values  have  statistical 
significance.  It  is  also  performed  to  examine  of  the 
residuals  (the  deviations  from  the  fitted  line  to  the 
observed values of log!) using residual plots for fitting a 
group of data.  Statistical  analysis  used the R package 
(http://www.r-project.org/).

databases  followed  the  famous  Zipfs  law  curve.  The 
distribution  of Zipfs law typically followed  a power law 

function with  an  exponent close to -1  (Zipf,  1949). The 
most  common  method  of verifying  conformity to  Zipfs 

law is  a  linear regression  on  the  loge-loge  transformed 
data set (Lu et at.,  2005). The distribution has a similar 
linear appearance when plot on a log-log graph, where(cid:173)
b defines the slope in the equation of logj = log a - blogx. 
Table 2 showed the parameter values and the p-values 
of 15 rank-frequency plots.  As illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  our 
regression showed a good fit, with significant parameter 
values. The Zipfs plots of 15 peptide fragment databases 
showed the power-law distribution with the exponent in 
the range from -1.23- -0.86.  Luscombe et at.  reported 
that  power-law  function  provides  the  best  description 
among  linear,  exponential,  double-exponential,  triple(cid:173)
exponential,  stretched-exponential  and  lognormal  of  a 
wide  group  of  properties  associated  with  genomes 
(Luscombe  et  at.,  2002).  We  found  that  the  overall 
distributions  are  very  similar  against  each  peptide 
fragment database. The high- and  low-ranking masses 
of peptide fragment get out of the regression line in  Fig. 
1.  A residual plot is a scatter plot of the residuals and is 
easier  to  see  nonlinearity.  If  the  regression  model 
represents the data correctly, the residuals are randomly 
distributed  around the line with zero mean (Moore and 
McCabe,  2003).  However,  for nonlinearity related  data, 
the residual plot shows a systematic pattern, curve form. 
Our  15  residual  plots  showed  similar  curve  forms.  In 
other words, parameters were explained the Zipf's law in 
the  regression  model  but Zipf's  law distribution  doesn't 
determine linearity of regression  model.  The Zipf's  law 
has  been  not  exactly  conformed  to  the  linear  model 
because the line does not have linear forms in the data of 
high and low ranks. Manning and Schutze noted that the 
line is often a bad fit,  especially for low and high  ranks 
and  derives a  more general  relationship  between  rank 
and frequency (Manning and Schutze, 1999). Kalda also 
reported that the distribution of low variability periods in 
the  activity  of  human  heart  rate  typically  followed  a 
multi-scaling  Zipf's  law  and  presened  a  non-linear 
time-series  method  (Kalda  et at.,  2001).  It  has  been 
studying statistical model of Zipf's law. 

Size  distribution  and  Zipf's  law  plot  show  nearly 
similar patterns. The size distribution has a trend which 
guides cleavage sites to more frequencies and smaller 
sizes (Fig.  2).  These  size-frequency distributions have 
majority of which are covered a wide range relative to the 
majority of distribution with  only one cleavage site.  For 
example,  Pepsin  (pH > 2) and  Proteinase K cleave the 
C-terminal side ofF, L,  W, T, A,  E,  Q and that of A,  C, G, 
M,  F,  S,  Y,  W,  respectively.  Pepsin  has  different 
cleavage sites by pH;  Pepsin  (pH  1.3) and  pepsin  (pH 
>2) cleave C-terminal side ofF, Land that ofF, L,  W, Y, 
A,  E,  Q without exception. The shape of size-frequency 
distribution of pepsin (pH > 2) has more narrow than that

of pepsin (pH 1.3). Fig. 2 showed that the more cleavage 
sites digested by an enzyme, the smaller range obtained. 
Both  high-ranking  (common)  and  low-ranking (rare) 
words are not good candidates for keywords in database 
search and information retrieval (Luhn, 1957). Using this 
theory, Zipf's law normalization is also a useful tool than 
existing published  normalization methods in microarray 
(Lu  et  at.,  2005).  Several  analyses  have  studied  the 
relationship  of  power  law  and  biological  or  medical 
datasets.  We determined  the applicability of Zipfs law 
using  frequencies  of mass  of peptide  fragment  by  15 
enzymes. Our results also followed a power law distribution 
and were described by a simple mathematical model.
