The leading cause of cancer mortality globally amongst the women is due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There is 
need to explore anti-cancerous drugs against this life-threatening infection. Traditionally, different natural compounds such 
as  withaferin  A,  artemisinin,  ursolic  acid,  ferulic  acid,  (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate,  berberin,  resveratrol,  jaceosidin, 
curcumin, gingerol, indol-3-carbinol, and silymarin have been used as hopeful source of cancer treatment. These natural 
inhibitors have been shown to block HPV infection by different researchers. In the present study, we explored these natural 
compounds against E6 oncoprotein of high risk HPV18, which is known to inactivate tumor suppressor p53 protein. E6, a 
high throughput protein model of HPV18, was predicted to anticipate the interaction mechanism of E6 oncoprotein with 
these natural inhibitors using structure-based drug designing approach. Docking analysis showed the interaction of these 
natural inhibitors with p53 binding site of E6 protein residues 108–117 (CQKPLNPAEK) and help reinstatement of normal p53 
functioning. Further, docking analysis besides helping in silico validations of natural compounds also helped elucidating the 
molecular mechanism of inhibition of HPV oncoproteins.

Introduction

Human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  accounts  for  5.2%  of  all 
cancers globally. Besides cervical cancer HPV also causes a 
subset of anogenital, head and neck cancers [1, 2]. Most of 
the cancer mortality in women worldwide is due to cervical 
cancer with an estimated 527,624 new cases and 265,653 
annual  mortality  [3].  Among  more  than  200  HPV  types, 
mostly HPV type 18 and 16 are the main cause of cervical 
cancer i.e., 15.7% and 62.6%, respectively [4]. Further, HPV 
16 and 18 are also associated with penile cancer (63%–80%), 
vulva/vaginal  cancers  (80%–86%),  anal  cancer  (93%), 
oropharyngeal cancers (89%–95%), etc. [5]. Thus, these two 
HPV types are the main targets for designing anti cancer 
drugs.  The  HPV  onco-proteins  E6  and  E7,  have  been 

reported to interact with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and 
pRb  respectively  [6].  Both  p53  and  pRb  act  as  negative 
regulator of cell cycle and inhibit G0–G1 and G1–S phase 
transitions. 

These interactions apparently play important roles in the 
induction of cell immortality. The importance of p53-mediated 
apoptosis  has  been  recognized  in  terms  of  maintaining 
homeostasis and preventing neoplastic transformation. E6 
forms a ternary complex with p53 and E6 associated protein 
(E6AP) resulting in the degradation of p53 via ubiquitination 
pathway [7]. 

Although HPV has been known to be a causative agent for 
cervical cancer for more than three decades, the effective 
treatment against HPV infection is yet to be established [8]. 
Many natural plant origin compounds have been identified 
as promising sources of drugs for treatment and prevention

of cancer in the recent years [9, 10]. 

Indole-3-carbinol,  an  active  ingredient  of  cabbage, 
broccoli,  cauliflower,  brussels  sprouts,  etc.  was  reported 
with anti-estrogenic properties in cervical cells [11]. Ursolic 
acid  having  anti-mutagenic  nature  has  the  potential  to 
induce  apoptosis  in  tumor  cells  as  well  as  to  prevent 
malignant transformation of normal cells [12]. Resveratrol 
is a polyphenol isolated from the grapes skin, shown to alter 
both  cell  cycle  progression and  the  cytotoxic response  to 
ionizing radiation in cervical tumor cell lines [13]. Curcumin 
is cytotoxic to cervical cancer cells in a concentration de-
pendent and time-dependent manner and the cytotoxicity 
was higher in HPV infected cells. It down regulates both 
serine kinase AKT/nuclear factor κB pathway by sensitizing 
cancer cells [14]. It also down regulates the expression of 
HPV  oncoproteins,  resulting  in  loss  of  the  transforming 
phenotype and the cessation of cellular growth. Singh and 
Singh [15] explored other molecular mechanisms exerted by 
curcumin in cervical cancer cells, showing that it inhibits 
telomerase activity, RAS and ERK signaling pathway, cyclin 
D1, cyclooxygenase 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
activity [15]. Ginger (active ingredient, gingerol) is a natural 
dietary  component,  which  has  antioxidant  and  anticar-
cinogenic properties and its supplementation has shown to 
suppress  colon  carcinogenesis  [16].  Jaceosidin,  a  active 
ingredient of Artemisia argyi, reported to inhibit the binding 
between  oncoproteins  and  tumor  suppressors  p53  [17]. 
Through the post-attachment heparan sulfate-independent 
effect, it is reported that carrageenan block HPV infection by 
preventing the binding of HPV virions to cells [18]. Due to 
the  antiviral  and  antitumor  properties  of  (–)-epigalloca-
techin-3-gallate  (EGCG),  it  was  found  effective  in  HPV 
patients  with  infected  cervical  lesions  [19].  EGCG  also 
reported as an effective inhibitor of E6/E7 proteins due to its 
inhibitory effect on the growth of HeLa (HPV18 positive) 
and CaSki (HPV16 positive) cells in a time and concentration 
dependent manner [20]. Mahata et al. [21] studied the effect 
of berberine on HPV16 and HPV18 positive cervical cancer 
cell line, and observed that it can effectively target both the 
host and viral factors responsible for development of cervical 
cancer through inhibition of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 
expression. An in vitro study conducted by Karthikeyan et al. 
[22] reported the radiosensitizing potential of ferulic acid (a 
natural phenolic acid) on human cervical cancer cell lines 
(HeLa  and  ME-180)  [22].  Silymarin,  an  active  ingredient 
contained in the seeds of the milk thistle plant, reported to 
inhibit cervical cancer cell [23]. Hu et al. [24] evaluated the 
anti-tumor  effect  of  dihydroartemisinin  (DHA),  an  arte-
misinin derivative on HeLa and Caski cervical cancer cells 
and  found  that  DHA  treatment  caused  a  considerable 
inhibition of tumor development [24]. The active compound 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  2,  2015

of Withania somnifera i.e., withaferin A (WA) has reported to 
have antitumor, antiangiogenic and radiosensitizing activity 
[25, 26]. Through in vitro and in vivo study Munagala et al. 
[27] demonstrated the effective inhibition of proliferation of 
cervical cancer cells by WA. Further, they showed the down 
regulation of HPV E6 and restoration of p53 pathway by WA 
[27]. 

In the present study, we explicate the atomic interaction 
between plant-originated ligands and high risk HPV18 E6 
oncogenic protein. This study comprises of protein structure 
modeling  of  HPV18  E6  protein  employing  Phyre2  server 
followed by structural refinement and energy minimization 
by  Yet  Another  Scientific  Artificial  Reality  Application 
(YASARA)  energy  minimization  server.  To  analyze  the 
molecular interaction between HPV18 E6 onco-protein with 
natural ligands, AutoDock4.2 tool was used in this study.

500 GB hard drive, 6 GB RAM and 2.26 GHz processor was 
employed  in  this  study.  Different  online  resources  and 
AutoDock 4.2 were used in this study. 

HPV18 E6 protein

As HPV18 E6 protein was selected as drug target in this 
study, its amino acid sequence (GenBank ID: NP_040310.1) 
was retrieved from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). 

Prediction of protein structure and its validation

Phyre2  server  [28]  was  employed  for  modeling  of  the

Results and Discussion
Protein structure prediction and validation

There  are  158  amino  acids  in  the  protein  sequence  of 
HPV18  E6  protein.  As  the  experimentally  determined 
tertiary structure of E6 was not available, Phyre2 server was 
used  to  predict  its  three  dimensional  structure.  During 
structure prediction, crystal structure of C chain of full-length 
HPV  oncoprotein  e62  in  complex  with  lxxll  peptide  of 
ubiquitin  ligase  E6AP  (PDB  ID,  4GIZ)  was  taken  as 
structural  template  by  Phyre2  server.  There  was  query 
coverage of 89% and identities of 57% observed between 
target-template alignment. Upon structural refinement of 
predicted  structure  by  YASARA  Energy  Minimization 
Server, the total energy of refined structure was observed to 
be –19,732.64  kcal/mol  (score,  0.07),  whereas  it  was  as 
166,485.03  kcal/mol  (score, –0.55)  prior  to  energy  mini-
mization. 

Upon  Procheck analysis, 99.2% residues  of the  refined 
model (Fig. 2A) were found in most favourable region and 
additional allowed regions and only 0.8% (Ser59) residue in 
situated  generously  allowed  region,  whereas  not  a  single 
residue observed in the disallowed region of Ramachandran 
plot (Fig. 2B). The compatible Z score (Fig. 2C) value was 
observed  to  be –4.46  by  ProSA-web  evaluation,  which  is 
quite well within the native conformations range of crystal 
structures  [31].  The  residue  energy  of  the  refined  model 
were observed to be largely negative (Fig. 2D). The Protein 
Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool predict the LG score of 2.205 
for HPV18 E6 protein model, implying high precision of the 
modeled structure as  ProQ LG score of more than  1.5 is 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  2,  2015

essential for signifying that a predicted structure is of fairly 
good quality [33]. The overall quality factor is predicted to be 
91% by the ERRAT plot (Fig. 2E) showing the well accuracy 
of predicted structure. Overall, based on the above results, 
the reliability of the predicted model was suggested.

Interaction study of HPV18 E6 with natural ligands 
through docking analysis

As all the natural compounds were observed to be interact 
with  E6  protein  in  different  conformations  and  binding 
energy, the conformation with lowest binding energy was 
selected for analysis (Table 2). In case of HPV16 E6 protein, 
amino acid residues 113–122 (CQKPLCPEEK) were associated 
with p53 binding [38]. In our previous study we elucidated 
molecular interaction of HPV16 E6 proteins with natural 
inhibitors around these p53 binding site [37]. Upon BLAST 
[39]  sequence  comparison  of  E6  protein  of  HPV16  and 
HPV18,  it  was  observed  that  80%  of  the  p53  binding 
residues, conserved in E6 of HPV18 (Fig. 3). Thus, on the 
basis of molecular interaction of p53 binding site residues 
with  E6  protein,  the  active  site  residues  i.e.,  108–117 
(CQKPLNPAEK)  of  HPV18  E6  protein  were  consider  for 
docking analysis.

Fig. 4 showed best docking conformation of E6 protein 
with twelve ligand molecules and the complete interactions 
were put in Table 2. It was observed that all the ligands were 
interacting with E6 protein at p53 binding site residues. WA 
was observed to bind with HPV18 E6 protein with lowest 
binding energy of –5.85 kcal/mol and the inhibition constant 
was found to be 51.35 μM. It was found to interact with four 
amino acid residues of E6 (Glu116, Asn113, Asn122, and 
Ser140) by forming hydrogen bonds. Next to WA, artemisinin 
bound with E6 protein with binding energy of –5.68 kcal/mol 
and inhibition constant of 68.22 μM. It formed only one 
hydrogen  bonds  with  the  receptor  at  Leu112  residues. 
Ursolic  acid  and  ferulic  acid  also  observed  to  inhibit  E6 
protein with good binding affinity i.e., binding energy of

–5.31  and –5.18  kcal/mol,  respectively.  Other  six  natural 
compounds  indol-3-carbinol,  resveratrol,  jaceosidin,  ber-
berine, EGCG, and curcumin were observed to bind with the 
receptor (E6 protein) with binding energy range from –4.98 
kcal/mol  to –4.08  kcal/mol  (Table  2).  Further,  other  two 
compounds silymarin and gingerol found to interact with the 
receptor with less binding affinity i.e., binding energy of –
3.67 kcal/mol and –2.86 kcal/mol. 
Few recent in silico studies are also been carried out on 
HPV showing the importance of computational approach in 
drug designing. Muthukala et al. [40] observed the inhibitory 
effect of quercetin compound against human cervical cancer 
cell line proteins through in silico docking analysis. Kotadiya 
and  Georrge  [41]  identified  some  putative  drugs  from 
natural  products  against  HPV  through  in  silico  approach. 
Samant  et  al.  [42]  studied  the  molecular  interactions  of 
human  immunodeficiency  virus  antiviral  drugs  against 
HPV18 E6 through in silico approach. Mamgain et al. [43] 
also  observed  the  inhibitory  effect  of  natural  compounds 
such  as  colchine,  curcumin,  daphnoretin,  ellipticine, 
epigallocatechin-3-gallate,  etc.  against  HPV16  E6  protein 
using molecular docking [43]. In our study, we have taken 12 

natural compounds, reported to be used as an anti cancer 
agent  against  HPV  [11-27]  for  docking  analysis  and 
observed their molecular interaction against HPV18 E6. All 
the  natural  compounds  were  found  to  interact  with  p53 
binding site residues of HPV18 E6 onco-protein.

This interaction might disable E6 protein to bind with the 
host p53 protein helping correlate these natural compounds 
used as anti-cancerous agents to treat HPV infections.

For treatment of different cancers caused by HPV, various 
plant-originated compounds have been identified and tried 
as  hopeful  resources  for  cancer  therapy.  Due  to  the  en-
croachment  in  computational  biology  and  bioinformatics, 
validation of those natural compounds is possible through 
computational  approach.  The  E6  protein  of  HPV6  and 
HPV11 (low risk HPVs) is not able to degrade p53 protein 
whereas in case of high risk HPVs (HPV16 and HPV18), the 
E6  protein  able  to  inactivate  p53  protein  by  inducing  its 
degradation. Thus, in order to design a novel drug against 
cervical cancer, the HPV18 E6 protein can be considered as a 
suitable target. In this study, high throughput computational 
approach  have  been  employed  for  modeling  tertiary 
structure of E6 protein followed by docking using AutoDock
