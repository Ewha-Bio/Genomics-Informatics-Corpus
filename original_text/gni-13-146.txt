Previous studies in Holstein have shown 35% to 51.8% heritability in milk production traits, such as milk yield, fat, and 
protein,  using  pedigree  data.  Other  studies  in  complex  human  traits  could  be  captured  by  common  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), and their genetic variations, attributed to chromosomes, are in proportion to their length. Using 
genome-wide  estimation  and  partitioning  approaches,  we  analyzed  three  quantitative  Holstein  traits  relevant  to  milk 
production in Korean Holstein data harvested from 462 individuals genotyped for 54,609 SNPs. For all three traits (milk yield, 
fat, and protein), we estimated a nominally significant (p = 0.1) proportion of variance explained by all SNPs on the Illumina 
BovineSNP50 Beadchip (h2
G). These common SNPs explained approximately most of the narrow-sense heritability. Longer 
genomic regions tended to provide more phenotypic variation information, with a correlation of 0.46∼0.53 between the 

estimate  of  variance  explained  by  individual  chromosomes  and  their  physical  length.  These  results  suggested  that 
polygenicity was ubiquitous for Holstein milk production traits. These results will expand our knowledge on recent animal 
breeding, such as genomic selection in Holstein.

Introduction

New-generation sequencing technologies have substantially 
enhanced  the  development  of  genomic  tools  to  assist  in 
breeding  decisions.  Among  many  techniques,  genotyping 
technologies  have  enabled  breeders  or  researchers  to 
identify DNA regions or quantitative trait loci (QTL) asso-
ciated  with  a  particular  phenotypic  trait  of  domesticated 
animals.  Especially,  several  single-nucleotide  polymorphi-
sms  (SNPs)  and  QTL  associated  with  Holstein  complex 
traits, including economic traits related to milk production, 
were  investigated  in  the  approximate  10-year  wave  of 
genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs)  [1-3].  In  the 
near  past,  researchers  discovered  genetic  markers  and 
created marker panels for use in performing marker-assisted 

selection (MAS). Although MAS provided a first genomic 
approach to achieve breeding goals to animal breeders, the 
domesticated animal genome in MAS was taken lightly with 
narrow  perspectives.  MAS  is  restricted  when  it  comes  to 
predicting animal capacity, as it depends on a small number 
of QTLs that are tagged by markers associated with each trait 
[4]. Additionally, the gap between the proportion of phe-
notypic variance accounted for by the top SNPs that reach 
genome-wide  significance  level  in  a  GWAS  and  the 
heritability  estimated  from  pedigree  analyses  remained 
unexplained for most complex traits of human. This was 
called the missing heritability problem [5], explanations to 
which have been debated in the field [6].

Recent  studies  using  whole-genome  estimation  appro-
aches demonstrated that a large proportion of heritability for 
complex traits of humans can be captured by all common

SNPs on current genotyping arrays. It implies that there are 
a large number of variants with an effect that is too small to 
pass the stringent genome-wide significance level. In animal 
breeding, genomics selection (GS) has been developed to 
overcome restriction factors of MAS; it has covered a large 
number  of  variants  containing  small  effects.  The  funda-
mental difference between MAS and GS as important animal 
selection  tools  is  that  scale  GS  embraces  a  much  larger 
number of markers than MAS in predicting animal capacity. 
GS  uses  a  dense  set  of  markers  from  across  the  entire 
genome  to  use  all  markers  containing  SNPs  with  small 
effects.  This  feature  gives  GS  a  profound  advantage  over 
MAS.

For  predictions  based  on  genomic  data  for  humans,  a 
previous  study  has  already  estimated  the  proportion  of 
phenotypic variance. It was elucidated by the common SNPs 
all together on a genotyping array for a range of quantitative 
traits  in  a  large  homogenous  human  sample,  using  the 
whole-genome estimation and partitioning approaches [7]. 
The novelty of our research lies in animal capacity prediction 
based on genomic data due to the fact that animal evaluation 
is a core content in the breeding industry. Finally, to conduct 
our  animal  breeding  research  on  polygenic  inheritance, 
which was likely to be ubiquitous for complex Holstein traits 
associated  with  milk  production  traits,  the  genomic 
selection  technique  was  performed  along  with  various 
different analyses.

Methods
Korean Holstein data

This study used 462 Holsteins from Korea, and they had 
information on three phenotypes related to milk production 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

for parity 1 (Fig. 1). Three traits used in this study were milk 
yield, milk fat, and milk protein; 339 of 462 Holsteins in 
records of parity 1 had records of parity 2. The individuals 
produced milk in 63 farms and were born in 2005 to 2012. All 
candidates were measured for a range of quantitative traits 
through public surveys for livestock improvement.

Genotyped and imputed data

The genomic DNAs were isolated from snivel by using the 
nasal collection kit and were genotyped with 54,609 SNPs on 
the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip. We excluded the SNPs 
with  a  missingness  rate  of  0.05,  minor  allele  frequency 
(MAF) 0.01, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test p-value 
10-6 using PLINK [8]. Then, we removed SNPs on the sex 
chromosome  and  retained  41,099  autosomal  SNPs  for 
further  analysis.  After  this  quality  control,  462  Holstein 
genomic data had been imputed using BEAGLE [9].

Estimating and partitioning genetic variance using 
SNP data

We  estimated  the  genetic  relationship  matrix  (GRM) 
between all pairs of individuals from all genotyped SNPs For 
each  trait,  we  then  estimated  the  variance  that  can  be 
captured  by  all  SNPs  using  the  restricted  maximum 
likelihood approach in a mixed linear model:

y = Xb ＋ gG ＋ e

where y is a vector of phenotypes, b is a vector of fixed effects 
with its incidence matrix X, and gG is a vector of aggregate 
effects of all SNPs.

p  is the phenotypic variance. Details of the model and 
parameter estimation have been described elsewhere [10, 
11]. When we estimated genetic variance using SNP data, we 

have  to  consider  seasonal  effects  (winter,  December–
February;  spring,  March–May;  summer,  June–August;  and 
autumn,  September–November  based  on  birth  date)  as 

environmental  effects,  because  milk  production  traits  are 
closely related to season. Then, we performed ANOVA test 
to investigate the relationship between each trait (parity 1 
and 2) and seasonal effect. Milk fat had only a close relation 
to season in the ANOVA test of both parity 1 (p = 0.0267) 
and 2 (p = 0.000432). We counted on seasonal effect in only 
the analysis including milk fat. In addition, using the same 
method as above but allowing multiple genetic components 
to be fit simultaneously in the model, we partitioned h2
G  into 
the contributions of genic (h2
Gi) regions 
of the whole genome across all traits. The genic regions were 
defined  as  ±0  kb  of  the  3’  and  5’  untranslated  regions 
(UTRs).  A  total  of  13,297  SNPs  were  located  within  the 
boundaries of 7001 protein-coding genes for this definition 
(±0 kb). The total length of the 7001 protein-coding genes 
was approximately 585 Mb, which covered 21.91% of the 
genome. We performed these estimating and partitioning 
genetic variance using SNP data through GCTA [11].

Illumina  BovineSNP50  BeadChip.  There  were  462  indivi-
duals  and  41,099  autosomal  SNPs  after  quality  control 
(Methods section). All individuals were measured for three 
traits (milk yield, milk fat, and milk protein), which were 
related  to  milk  production.  The  phenotypic  correlations 
between pairwise traits are visualized in Supplementary Fig. 1. 
Correlations between milk yield and milk protein were much 
stronger than other pairwise comparisons.

We  estimated  the  proportion  of  variance  explained  by 
fitting all SNPs in a mixed linear model for each of the three 
traits. In general, there was a substantial amount of variance 
explained by all autosomal SNPs after quality control on the 
Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip (σ2
G ) for three traits of the 
records of two parities, with a mean of 43.51% (a range from 
36.3 to 47%) across all three traits of the records of two 
parities (Table 1). In the records, the estimate of h2
G  was 
non-zero  and  reached  the  nominal  significance  level 
(likelihood ratio test, p = 0.05). We compared the estimates 
G  with the narrow-sense heritability h2, estimated from 
of h2
pedigree analyses in the literature based on Canada Holstein. 
G  was similar to h2 from pedigree analysis in 
The value of h2
the  literature,  and  all  common  SNPs  explained  most 
(average,  43.51%;  range  from  36.3%  to  47%)  of  the 
narrow-sense  heritability  (average,  41.38%;  range  from 
36.3%  to  47%),  despite  the  estimates  of  h2  being  from 
different country populations (Table 1). In contrast, when 
we  performed  a  genome-wide  association  analysis  in  the 
same sample, we tried to identify genome-wide-significant 
(Bonfferoni correction p  =  0.05)  SNPs for three traits of 
parity 1. Three SNPs and one SNP were significant in milk 
yield and fat, respectively, and there were no significant SNPs 
for milk protein (Supplementary Fig. 2). We hypothesized 
that  there  was  a  major  reason  for  only  a  few  significant 
large-effect SNPs associated with Holstein traits related to 
milk production. First of all, many SNPs with small effects 
affected the three traits related to milk production. Second, 
according  to  previous  studies,  there  are  many  common 
variants associated with the traits in humans at a nominally 
significant level, but their effect sizes are too small to be 
genome-wide-significant [7].

Using the same method as above but allowing multiple 
genetic components to be fit simultaneously in the model, 
we then partitioned h2
G  into the contributions of individual 
chromosomes for each of the three traits of two parities and 
plotted the estimate of variance explained by each chromo-
some (h2
C ) against the chromosome length for each trait. In 
a  previous  study,  no  linear  correlation  between  h2
C   and 
chromosome length for any particular traits was observed for 
most traits in humans as strongly as shown in the other 
studies. Then, the average value of estimates of h2
G  over all of 
tens traits to reduce the sampling error variance, and the 

148

average  estimated  h2
C   was  strongly  correlated  with  chro-
mosome length. However, we dealt with only three traits 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

related to milk production, and we aimed to identify a linear 
correlation  between  h2
C   and  chromosome  length  for  each 
trait. The squared correlation between h2
C  and chromosome 
length using trait information of parity 1 was 0.46, 0.532, 
and 0.509 for milk yield, fat, and protein, respectively (Fig. 
2). The  regression  slope of  the  proportion  of  the  genetic 
variance attributed to each chromosome on the proportion 
of  the  genome  represented  by  each  chromosome  was 
significant (p＜0.1), suggesting a proportional relationship 
between genome length and genetic variance in Holstein. 
Consistent  results  were  achieved  from  myriad  genetic 
variants,  each  possessing  a  small  effect  throughout  the 
widespread whole genome in Holstein.

In addition, we partitioned h2

G  into the contributions of 
genic (h2
Gi) regions of the whole genome 
(Methods section). We estimated the variance explained by 
the genic (h2
Ci) regions of each chro-
mosome. The numbers of genic and intergenic SNPs on each 
chromosome are presented in Supplementary Table 2. We 
showed that the variance explained by the genic (intergenic) 
regions on each chromosome is also proportional to the total 
length of the genic (intergenic) regions (Fig. 3).

Discussion

Previous  studies  using  the  whole-genome  estimation 
approach have shown that common SNPs explicate a large 
proportion of heritability for traits in human [10, 12]. The 
reason why GWASs in this field have not yet identified all 
common SNPs that contain information on the amount of 
variation is mainly that many peculiar effects are too small to 
pass the stringent genome-wide significance level. There-
fore, we hypothesized that inheritance of Korean Holstein 
milk  production  traits  would  consist  of  a  lot  of  genetic 
variants  with  small  effects.  Finally,  we  estimated  and 
partitioned the genetic variance that met certain conditions, 
tagged by all common SNPs for three complex traits related 
to  milk  production  and  showing  ubiquitous  polygenic 
inheritance of Korean Holstein. The estimates of h2
G  for three 
traits were different from 0 at the significance level (p＜0.1). 
The estimate of h2
G  for milk yield of parity 1 was 43.0% (SE 
= 10.3%), which was smaller than the estimate from a study 
in Canada (h2
G  = 52%) [13]. There could be three possible 
reasons: (1) There is a difference in the reference population 
size between Korea and Canada. In fact, Koreans import a lot 
of  Canada  Holstein  semen,  but  the  present  reference 
population  is  smaller  than  Canada.  (2)  The  Korean 
environment is different from Canada. (3) We can consider 
only one environmental effect (season) due to data size in 
this study. The estimate for milk fat (h2
G  = 47.0%, SE =

regions nor by the difference in MAF distribution between 
genic  and  intergenic  SNPs  [7].  If  trait-associated  genetic 
variants are enriched in functional elements, such as introns 
and UTRs, and diluted in exons, the relationship between 
the explained variance and DNA length will be attenuated in 
the genic region, as in human. However, it could possibly be 
just a sampling problem. Because our data size was smaller 
than our expectancy, some chromosomes did not reach the 
significance  level  (p  =  0.01)  in  the  genome  partitioning 
analysis. In the genome partitioning analysis for milk yield 
using SNPs in the intergenic region and milk protein using 
SNPs in the genic region, the linear regression results were 

G  = 36.9%, protein h2

10.1%) and protein (h2
larger than in Canada (fat h2

G  = 44.3%, SE = 10.2%) in Korea was 
G  = 42.3%).
It is demonstrated by the genome partitioning analysis 
that there was a significant linear relationship between the 
estimates of variance explained by individual chromosomes 
and  chromosome  length  (Fig.  2).  If  we  define  the  genic 
region  as  ±0  kb  of  the  UTRs,  the  correlation  between 
variance explained and chromosome length was stronger in 
the intergenic regions than in the genic regions (Fig. 3). A 
previous  study  showed  by  a  number of  analyses that  the 
result in this was driven neither by the difference between 
the  number  of  SNPs  in  genic  regions  and  in  intergenic

also  insignificant,  and  we  could  identify  some  outliers. 
Moreover,  when  these  outliers  were  removed,  the  linear 
regression  results  were  significant  (E  in  Fig.  3).  We 
hypothesize that some chromosomes could have a slightly 
larger effect than our expectation, based on the fitted line in 
special cases (chromosome 17 or 4 in milk protein).

We showed by whole-genome estimation and partitioning 
analyses that Holstein milk production traits appeared to be 
highly  polygenic,  which  means  that  there  were  a  large 
number  of  genetic  variants  segregating  in  the  population 
with  a  small  effect  widely  distributed  across  the  whole 
genome.  All  common  SNPs  expressed  most  of  the 
heritability on average over all 3 traits analyzed in this study. 
The slight, remaining unexplained heritability could be due 
to causal variants, including common and rare ones that are 
not  well  tagged  by  SNPs  on  this  Illumina  SNP  chip,  or 
possibly because the heritability was over-estimated in the 
pedigree study. In conclusion, heritability consists of many 
variants  with  small  effects  for  Holstein  milk  production 
traits  in  Korea.  Overall,  this  research  will  become  a 
cornerstone  for  genomic  selection  applications  in  animal 
breeding.
