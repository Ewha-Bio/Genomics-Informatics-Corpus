Abstract 
Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  one  of  the  most 
common  malignancies  worldwide  and  a 
typical 
hypervascular  tumor.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  find 
factors  related  to  angiogenesis  in  the  process  of  HCC 
malignancy. In order to find angiogenesis-related factors 
in  HCC,  we  used  combined  methods  of  in  silico 
prediction  and  an  experimental  assay.  We  analyzed 
1457  genes  extracted  from  eDNA  microarray  of  HCC 
patients by text-mining,  sequence similarity search and 
domain analysis. As a result, we predicted that 16 genes 
were likely to be involved in  angiogenesis and then the 
effects  of  these  genes  were  confirmed  by  hypoxia 
response  element(HRE)-Iuciferase  assay.  For  instant, 
we classified osteopontin into a potent angiogenic factor 
and  coagulation  factor  XII 
angiogenic factor.  Collectively,  we suggest that using a 
combination  of  in  silico  prediction  and  experimental 
approaches, we can identify HCC-specific angiogenesis(cid:173)
related factors effectively and rapidly.

I ntrocluction 
Hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  one  of  the  most 
common  malignant  tumors  worldwide  and  causes 
significant  medical  expense  and  mortality (Feitelson  et 
a/., 2002). There are several reports on many risk factors 
involved  in  HCC.  These  risk  factors  include  toxin 
exposure, chronic viral infection, and cirrhosis (Anders et

a/.,  2003). Although all the risk factors may cause direct 
damage to the genomic DNA and further induce hepatic 
carcinogenesis, the molecular mechanism remains to be 
studied (Tsai  eta/., 2003). 

Generally, HCC is a hypervascular tumor- especially 
large and advanced HCC are richly supplied with blood 
vessels- with an extremely poor prognosis (Yamaguchi 
eta/.,  1998; Mise eta/.,  1996; Nakashima eta/.,  1999). 
HCC tissues express lots of angiogenic factors, such as 
vascular  endothelial  growth 
factor  (VEGF),  basic 
fibroblast  growth  factor  (bFGF)  and  insulin-like  growth 
factor  (IGF)-11  (Kim  et  a/.,  1998;  Park  et  a/.,  1995). 
Angiogenesis  is  a  process of new capillaries sprouting 
from  pre-existing  vessels,  which 
is  different  from 
vasculogenesis  by  which  endothelial  cells  arise  from 
progenitor cell types (Risau, 1997). It is known that tumor 
growth  and  metastasis  are  angiogenesis-dependent 
(Folkman, 1990). Therefore, therapies targeting pathological 
angiogenesis could be highly specific and be associated 
with  little  toxicity  (Eatock  et a/.,  2000).  It  is  therefore 
important  to  find  angiogenesis-related  factors  for  the 
treatment of HCC. 

In  order  to  find  angiogenesis-related  factors  in  the 
progress of HCC,  we focused  our interests on  in silico 
screening and a cell based assay. Scheme of work flow 
is shown  in  Figure  1.  The eDNA microarray data (data 
not shown) were from the Center for Functional Analysis 
of  Human  Genome  (Daejon,  Korea)  and  composed  of 
1457 gene lists that were up- or down-regulated in HCC 
patients. Based on these microarray data, we carried out 
in  si/ico  screening  approaches,  text-mining,  sequence 
similarity  search  and  domain  structure  analysis.  Then, 
we performed hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)-Iuciferase 
assays for evaluating angiogenic effects of in silico data. 
HRE-Iuciferase assay is a sensitive and simple method 
for  evaluating  an  angiogenic  activity.  As  a  result,  we 
could  identify  several  genes  as  angiogenesis-related 
factors in human hepatocellualr carcinoma. 

Methods 
Text mining 
First,  105  genes  that  had  full  length  sequences  and 
concurrently  whose  expression-fold  ratios  were  larger 
than 2 or smaller than  -2 were selected from HCC chip 
data.  These  ratios  were  considered  to  be  significantly

Fig.  1.  Scheme of in  silico data mining workflow.  Workflow consists of two steps.  First,  angiogenesis-related genes were 
predicted  by three in  silico screenings  based  on  microarray data,  which  are text-mining, sequence simirarity search,  and 
domain analysis. Then,  the angiogenesis-related activities of the predicted genes were assayed by luciferase assay. 

different.  Subsequently,  we  investigated  angiogenesis(cid:173)
related  effects  of  these  genes  which  were  reported  in 
PubMed  abstract  information  and  could  classify  the 
genes into two groups- angiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis. 

Sequence similarity search using local BLAST 
We  downloaded  stand-alone  BLAST 2.2.6  (binary  file: 
from  NCBI's  BLAST  ftp 
blast-2.2.6-ia32-win32.exe) 
server (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executableslrelease/ 
2.2.61).  First,  gene  lists  having  Swiss-Prot  (http://au. 
expasy.org/sprotl)  accession  numbers  were  parsed  to 
Swiss-Prot  database.  Thereafter,  FASTA-formatted 
sequences  were  generated,  and  sequence  database 
were  constructed  using  'formatdb'  in  BLAST  package. 
Then,  the  FASTA format  sequences were  aligned with 
angiogenesis-related  factors  using  'blastp'  in  BLAST 
package. In this process, we used the AngioDB (http://angiodb. 
snu.ac.kr) to draw the information regarding to angiogenesis. 
The  AngioDB  is  a  secondary  database  focused  on 
angiogenesis-related factors (Sohn eta/., 2002). 

Domain analysis using HMMER 
HMMER program - HMMER 2.2g  binaries  for  DQS/Cygwin 
environment  version  - was  downloaded  from  HMMER 

official  web site  (http://hmmer.wsustl.edu/).  For domain 
search,  two angiogenesis-related domains (Kringle and 
ECM1) reported in Pfam database (http://pfam.wustl.edu/) 
were selected, and downloaded as a hmms seed format 
file.  Then,  domain  database  were  constructed  using 
'hmmbuild'  in  HMMER package by adding three  'hmm' 
files to database.  The domain  DB was calibrated  using 
'hmmcalibrate'.  Finally, sequence file of HCC chip data 
was searched by domain DB using 'hmmsearch'. 

Cell culture 
HepG2  cells  were  maintained  in  m1n1mum  essential 
medium  (MEM)  (Invitrogen,  Gaithersburg,  MD,  USA) 
with  10% 
(Invitrogen, 
Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and 1% antibiotics. For hypoxic 
conditions,  cells  were placed for  18 hours in a  hypoxic 
chamber (Forma scientific,  Inc.,  Marietta,  OH)  with  1% 
02,  5% C02, and 94% N2  in a humidified atmosphere.

Transient transfection 
The day before transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well 
plates so that they were about 50% confluent at the day 
of transfection.  To carry out  luciferase assay,  plasmids 
were transfected to 2x105  HepG2 cells per well, with the

Luciferase assay 
Transiently  transfected  cells  were  harvested  after 
treatment  of  hypoxia  or  normoxia  for  18  hours  and 
extracts  were  prepared  using  reporter  lysis  buffer 
(Promega, Madison, WI). Celllysates were analyzed for 
luciferase  activity  using  assay  kit  (Promega,  Madison, 
WI)  and  luminometer  (AutoLumat  LB953,  berthold)  as 
manufacture's  manual.  .13-galactosidase  enzyme  from 
extracts was also analyzed to correct relative luciferase 
units  (RLU).  Each  condition  was  assayed  three  times, 
and  the  luciferase  activity  was  calculated  as  RLU  I ft 
-galactosidase activity. 

Results 
Six genes selected by text-mining method 
The microarray chip experiments of HCC patients were 
performed  by  the  Center  for  Functional  Analysis  of 

Human  Genome  (Daejon,  Korea).  We  selected  105 
genes  among  the  HCC  microarray  chip  data.  Those 
genes had expression-fold ratio and full-length clones. In 
this step, the data whose expression-fold ratio was larger 
than 2 or smaller than -2 were selected.  Thereafter, we 
selected  6  genes  reported  on  angiogenesis  from  the 
information of PubMed abstract. However, they have not 
been  reported  for  angiogenic  effects  in  HCC.  So,  we 
investigated  angiogenic  effects  of  those  genes  in  a 
hepatoma cell  line. 

As  shown  in  Table  1,  the  fold  ratio  of  osteopontin 
(OPN)  was  9.6,  the  highest of  all  data.  Also,  a securin 
(pituitary tumor-transforming protein 1) and annexin A2 
were selected to be angiogenic and each fold-ratio of a 
securin and annexin A2 was 2.24 and 2.28, respectively. 
Securin has been known to play a role in pituitary tumors 
and stimulates fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2-mediated 
angiogenesis  (Ishikawa  eta/.,  2001).  Annexin  A2  has 
been known to be a predominant receptor for angiostatin 
and blocks angiostatin's activity (Tuszynski eta/., 2002). 
As  anti-angiogenic factors,  two  apolipoproteins  and 
antithrombin-Ill were selected. Antithrombin-Ill is known 
to have a serpin (serine protease inhibitor) structure and 
inhibit angiogenesis (Corvo! eta/., 2003). Apolipoproteins 
have been known to contain variable numbers of Kringle 
domains that share 61-75% homology with  Kringle 4 of 
plasminogen  (McLean  eta/.,  1987) and  have effects of 
anti-angiogenesis  and  anti-tumor  growth  (Kim  et  a/., 
2003). lsoform of apolipoprotein A 1 has been reported to

Description 

Krin~le domains have been found in  plasminogen,  hepatocyte growth factors,  prothrombin,  and 
apolipoprotein A.  Structure is disulfide-rich,  nearly all-beta. 

This family consists of several eukaryotic extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) sequences.  ECM1 
has been shown to regulate endochondral bone formation, stimulate the proliferation of endothelial 
c~lls and  induce angiogenesis.  Mutations in the ECM1  gene can cause lipoid proteinosis,  a 
disorder wh1ch  causes generalized thickening of skin,  mucosae and certain viscera.  Classical 
features  include beaded eyelid papules and laryngeal infiltration leading to  hoarseness.

Five genes showing high sequence similarity with 
three angiogenesis-related genes in the AngioDB 
For the sequence alignment, we parsed 1457 HCC chip 
data to  Swiss-Prot as  FASTA format  protein  sequence 
file.  Then, 
those  sequences  were  aligned  with 
angiogenesis-related  factors  in  AngioDB.  All  options 
except for E-value (under 0.001) were of default values. 
Results from sequence alignment were shown in Table 2. 
AKAP12  was  found  in  HCC  chip  data.  AKAP12 
encodes a major cytoskeleton-associated protein kinase 
C substrate and  kinase-scaffolding  activities  (Lin  eta/., 
1996).  AKAP12  may  be  considered  as  anti-angiogenic 
factor  in  vivo and  in  vitro (Lee  eta/.,  2003).  Tid-1  was 
aligned  to  DnaJ  homolog  subfamily  A  member  2  with 
score:  111, E-value: 5 x e·26
.  Tid-1  is a RasGAP-binding 
protein  known  for  a tumor suppressor gene  (Trentin  et 
a!.,  2001 ).  Moreover,  Tid-1  was  reported  to  inhibit 
angiogenesis  by  degradation  of  HIF-1 a  (Bae  et  a/., 
2004). Necdin was aligned to three MAGE family genes. 
Necdin promotes differentiation and survival of neurons 
interactions  with  E2F1 
through 
(Kobayashi  eta!.,  2002)  and  is expected to  be a tumor 
suppressor (Taniura eta/.,  1999).

Five proteins containing angiogenesis-related 
domains 
We used the HMMER as a protein domain analysis tool. 
HMMER is a profile Hidden Markov Model- implemented 
program for protein sequence analysis.  For the domain 
analysis, we searched angiogenesis-related domains in 
Pfam database. Then, we selected 2 protein domains of 

Kringle  domains  have  disulfide-rich,  nearly  all-beta 
structure  (Pfam  database,  http://pfam.wustl.edu/),  and 
are well  known  to  have anti-angiogenic effects  (Cao  et 
a/.,  2002).  Kringle  domains  have  been 
in 
plasminogen,  hepatocyte  growth  factor,  prothrombin, 
and  apolipoprotein  A.  Extracellular  matrix  protein  1 
(ECM  1)  domain  family  consists  of  several  eukaryotic 
extracellular matrix protein 1 sequences. ECM1  domains 
play  a  role  in  the  regulation  of  endochondral  bone 
formation,  proliferation  of  endothelial  cells,  and 
angiogenesis (Han  eta!., 2001;  Deckers eta/., 2001 ).

For  the  domain  analysis,  we  downloaded  HMMER 
program  - HMMER  2.2g  binaries  for  DOS/Cygwin 
environment version- from HMMER official web site and 
each  of  domain  hmm  files  was  added  to  angiodomain 
local  DB.  Finally,  profile  hmm  DB  were  constructed.  A 
hmm file is a score table composed of statistical values 
calculated  by  profiled  model.  Then,  1457  gene 
sequences from  HCC chip data as FAST A format were 
parsed to profile hmm db (E-value < 0.001 ).  As a result, 
we  found  that  5  proteins  had  angiogenesis-related 
domains  (Table  4).  Four  proteins  had  Kringle  domain 
under limited E-value in HCC data, which are plasminogen 
precursor,  coagulation  factor  XII  (HAF),  urokinase-type 
plasminogen  activator  (uPA),  and  hepatocyte  growth 
factor  activator  (HGFA).  ECM  1  domain  was  found  in 
ECM1  protein of 1457 gene sequences.

expresses many angiogenesis-related factors.  Because 
prognosis  of  HCC 
is  very  poor  and  molecular 
mechanism of  HCC is  very complicated,  it is  difficult to 
find  a  HCC-specific  marker or  an  effective  therapeutic 
target.  Because  of  these  difficulties,  we  performed 
bioinformatic  approaches  to  analyze  HCC  chip  data 
effectively and efficiently. 

First  of  all,  in  text-mining  results,  6  genes  were 
selected as candidates. Among them, fold-ratio of OPN 
was  9.6  ,the highest of  HCC chip  data.  OPN  has  been 
known  to  be  a  multifunctional  phosphoprotein  with 
angiogenic  activity  (Hirama  et  a/.,  2003),  and  to  be 
secreted  by  several  cell  types  including  osteoclasts, 
lymphocytes,  macrophages,  and tumor cells  (Denhardt 
eta/.,  1993). OPN  was over-expressed in  HBx infected 
metastatic  HCC  (Ye  et  a/.,  2003)  and  intrahepatic 
metastasis  (Pan  et a/.,  2003).  In  the  luciferase  assay 
(Figure  2a),  OPN  also  showed  significantly  increased 
relative  lucifease  activity  (RLA).  Moreover,  OPN  is  a 
secreted  protein  which  can  be  detected  in  the  blood. 
Therefore, OPN could be a potential angiogenic marker 
of HCC. 

Second,  in  the  sequence  analysis,  5  genes  were 
selected  with  significant  statistic  values.  Among  them, 
A-kinase  anchor  protein  12  (AKAP12)  was  found  in 
AngioDB. AKAP12 is known to suppress angiogenesis in 
vivo and  in  vitro.  DnaJ  homolog subfamily A member 2 
(DNAJA2)  was  aligned  to  Tid-1  which  may  suppress 
angiogenesis by degradation of  HI F-1 a.  In  the  result of 
the luciferase assay, DNAJA2 showed an anti-angiogenic 
effect (Figure 3b). 

Third,  in  the  domain  analysis,  5  genes  including 
Kringle and ECM1  domain were selected with significant 
values.  The  domain  structures  used  in  our  domain 
structure  analysis  were  reported  in  Pfam  database. 
Plasminogen  is  an  anti-angiogenic  factor  containing  a 

well-known  anti-angiogenic  protein,  angiostatin,  and 
urokinase type plasminogen activator participates in the 
activation  of  plasminogen.  Hepatocyte  growth  factor 
activator  (HGFA)  and  coagulation  factor XII  (Hageman 
Factor,  HAF)  participate  in  the  activation of  hepatocyte 
growth  factor  (HGF)  when  liver  tissue  injury  occurs 
(Shimomura  eta/.,  1995;  Miyazawa  et  a/.,  1996).  In 
addition,  plasminogen and  HGFA were down-regulated 
in other microarray analysis (Delpuech  eta/., 2002) and 
in  our  HCC  chip  data  (each  fold-ratio  was  -6.81  and 
-2.71 ).  Furthermore,  HAF  significantly  decreased 
relative  luciferase  activity  in  our  experimental  result 
(Figure  3a).  Therefore,  these  genes  having  Kringle 
domain may play an important role in injured HCC. 

Collectively,  of  1457  genes  generated  from  eDNA 
microarray data of HCC patients, we found that 16 genes 
were 
likely  to  have  angiogenesis-related  functions 
through  text-mining,  sequence  similarity  search  and 
domain  analysis.  Thereafter,  the  angiogenic  effects  of 
these  genes  were  evaluated  by  the  luciferase  assay. 
Although  more  investigation  on  predicted  genes  is 
needed,  the  results  of  this  work  could  provide  the 
possibility that in silica prediction is useful for identifying 
novel factors for angiogenesis in HCC.
