A decade-long project, led by several international research groups, called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), 
recently released an unprecedented amount of data. The ambitious project covers transcriptome, cistrome, epigenome, and 
interactome data from more than 1,600 sets of experiments in human. To make use of this valuable resource, it is important 
to understand the information it represents and the techniques that were used to generate these data. In this review, we 
introduce the data that ENCODE generated, summarize the observations from the data analysis, and revisit a computational 
approach that ENCODE used to predict gene expression, with a focus on the human transcriptome and its association with 
chromatin modifications.

Introduction

In September 2012, 30 research papers, including 6 in 
Nature,  were  published  online  (http://www.nature.com/ 
encode/)  about  genomescale  data  from  a  decade-long 
project, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) [1]. 
Aiming to delineate all functional elements encoded in the 
human genome [1-4], the ENCODE project examined 1% of 
the human genome in its pilot phase and scaled up to the 
whole genome in  its  second phase.  It released data  from 
more  than  1,600  sets  of  experiments  from  147  types  of 
tissues [4]. These data include a catalog of human protein- 
coding and noncoding RNAs as well as protein-DNA interac-
tions,  chromatin  and  DNA  accessibility,  histone  modifi-
cations,  DNA  methylation,  and  long-range  chromosomal 
interactions. The ENCODE consortium reported that 80.4% 
of  the  human  genome  serves  some  type  of  known  bio-
chemical function [4]. The unprecedented volume and span 
of this study will make it an excellent resource for biological 
analyses. On the other hand, it can be overwhelming for a 
researcher to access and interpret the data. ENCODE also 
developed  novel  (or  refined  existing)  techniques  for  data 
generation and computational analyses. These techniques 

are by no means restricted to ENCODE and can be employed 
in a wide array of applications. Because of the vast span of 
ENCODE,  we  will  limit  our  scope  to  the  human  trans-
criptome and its association with chromatin modifications 
in this review. We aim to introduce the data that ENCODE 
generated  and  the  techniques  (both  experimental  and 
computational)  that  were  used  to  generate  them.  We 
summarize the observations that ENCODE found. We also 
provide a detailed discussion of a machine learning method 
that was used to predict gene expression from chromatin 
modifications with higher accuracy than its predecessors. 

Chromatin  Modifications  Measured  by 
Chromatin  Immunoprecipitation  Sequencing 
(ChIP-seq)

DNA sequences are wrapped around octamers of histone 
proteins to form nucleosomes, the unit of chromatin. The 
nucleosome core is composed of two copies each of four 
histone proteins. Each histone has an N-terminal tail that 
faces outward from the nucleosome and can be chemically 
modified to influence the accessibility of the chromatin and 
interactions with other chromatin-binding proteins. These

histone modifications are associated with the activation or 
repression of gene transcription [5] and many other acti-
vities  of  the genome, such  as  enhancer  activities  [6]  and 
splicing regulation [7, 8]. There has been great interest in 
dissecting  the  interactions  between  histones  and  other 
chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulation in 
recent years [9]. One of ENCODE’s major goals [4] is to use 
these chromatin modifications to define regulatory elements 
of the human genome in multiple cell lines and to investigate 
their interactions with RNA transcription.

Chromatin  immunoprecipitation  (ChIP)  is  an  experi-
mental technique used to investigate protein-DNA interac-
tions in the cell. ChIP, followed by microarray (ChIP-chip) or 
high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), is widely used to 
determine  genomewide  binding  locations  of  proteins, 
including  transcription  factors,  covalent  modifications  of 
histones,  and  other  chromatin  regulatory  proteins.  ChIP- 
chip  was  the  chosen  technology  for  the  pilot  phase  of 
ENCODE  to  dissect  the  regulatory  regions  in  the  1% 
selected portion of the human genome [2, 10, 11]. As next- 
generation  sequencing  technology  advanced  [12],  it  soon 
became clear that ChIP-seq was a superior approach [13, 14]. 
ChIP-seq was the chosen technology for the second phase 
of the ENCODE project [3, 4, 15]. Although ChIP-seq shows 
clear advantages over ChIP-chip, it is by no means a perfect 
technology. In an evaluation study performed by Chen et al. 
[16], multiple factors were found to influence the fidelity of 
ChIP-seq data. For example, ChIP-seq data were found to be 
biased  toward  open  chromatin  regions,  leading  to  false 
positives if not corrected; comparison of different algorithms 
also showed notable variation in sensitivity and specificity. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  2,  2013

The ENCODE consortium has established a set of guidelines 
to ensure the quality of ChIP-seq experiments [15]. Because 
antibodies play a predominant role in the success of ChIP 
experiments, a significant effort has been made by ENCODE 
to  characterize  the  specificity  and  efficiency  of  a  large 
number of antibodies. The list of the antibodies used and 
validated  by  ENCODE  can  be  found  at:  http://genome. 
ucsc.edu/ENCODE/antibodies.html. A large-scale assess-
ment  of  histone  modification  antibodies  (＞200)  was 
performed  by  multiple  groups  [17]  of  the  ENCODE 
consortium, with the most up-to-date information available 
at:  http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/antibodies/.  In  addi-
tion, multiple quality metrics have been developed and used 
by the ENCODE project [15], as listed in Table 1. Having 
employed these quality metrics, the ENCODE consortium 
mapped 11 histone modifications plus one histone variant 
across 46 human cell types, including a complete matrix of 
the 12 marks across two groups of cell lines, designated as 
tier 1 and tier 2.

ENCODE releases a reference gene set (GENCODE) 
and RNA expression catalogs

The ENCODE project has produced a reference gene set, 
referred to as GENCODE (http://www.gencodegenes.org) 
[18]. GENCODE (version 7) identified a comprehensive set 
of 20,687 protein-coding and 9,640 manually curated long 
noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci (representing 15,512 non-
coding transcripts/isoforms). Currently, in version 15, it has 
20,447 coding genes and 13,249 lncRNA loci (representing

22,531 noncoding transcripts/isoforms). For this reference 
gene set, GENCODE used manual gene annotation from the 
Human and Vertebrate Analysis and Annotation (HAVANA) 
group (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/projects/verteb
rategenome/havana/) and automatic gene annotation from 
Ensembl  [19].  To  construct  a  comprehensive  RNA  ex-
pression catalog, ENCODE sequenced RNA (using RNA- 
seq)  from  15  different  cell  lines  in  multiple  subcellular 
fractions [18]. The expression catalog in multiple cell types 
provides the transcriptome of coding and noncoding genes, 
short  (＜200  bp)  and  long  (＞200  bp)  in  length,  poly-
adenylated  or  nonpolyadenylated,  as  well  as  the  com-
partment in cells where RNAs in each type are populated. 

Long noncoding RNAs 

LncRNAs are nonprotein-coding transcripts longer than 
200 nucleotides. LncRNAs have been known to have similar 
characteristics  as  coding  RNAs.  They  are  polyadenylated, 
associated with chromatin signatures, and have multiexonic 
structure [20, 21]. Some lncRNAs use identical or almost 
identical transcription initiation complexes [22] and some-
times  overlap  with  protein-coding  genes  and  can  be 
transcribed from either strand [22, 23]. 

GENECODE  interrogated  the  properties  of  15,512 
lncRNAs.  Table  2  summarizes  the  comparison  between 
lncRNAs  and  coding  RNAs.  Expressed  lncRNAs  have  an 
activating  histone  modification  profile  similar  to  that  of 
protein-coding  genes,  with  slightly  excess  levels  of  both 
silencing (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K36me3) marks 
in  lncRNAs  [24].  Although  many  lncRNAs  are  polya-
denylated,  they  are  significantly  enriched  in  nonpoly-
adenylated transcripts compared with coding RNAs [24]. As 
expected,  the  lncRNAs  have  significantly  lower  protein 
potentials  compared with mRNAs. Interestingly,  they are 
biased  toward  two-exon  transcripts  and  predominately 
localized in the chromatin and nucleus, while coding RNAs 
are predominantly observed in the cytosol; only 6% of them 

have a 2-exon structure. 

In order to identify the function and targets of lncRNAs, 
Derrien    et  al.  [24]  investigated  the  correlation  between 
lncRNAs  and  coding  RNAs;  both  positive  and  negative 
correlations  were  found.  Overall,  the  number  of  positive 
correlations  was  larger  than  the  negative  correlations. 
Compared with trans-acting lncRNAs, cis-acting lncRNAs 
showed more positive correlations. Interestingly, lncRNAs 
that  intersected  protein-coding  exons  in  the  antisense 
orientation showed a strong pattern of coexpression [24]. 
They  also  checked  sequence  conservation  by  BLASTing 
human lncRNAs against all available mammalian genomes. 
Around 30% (n = 4,546) of lncRNAs appeared to have arisen 
in the primate lineage, and 0.7% (n = 101) of them appeared 
to be human-specific [24].

RNA splicing 

Recent studies suggest that many pre-mRNA processing 
events are cotranscriptional [25-27]. RNA imaging found 
that splicing can follow the completion of transcription [28]. 
Tilgner et al. [29] investigated cotranscriptional splicing by 
interrogating  RNA  fractions  from  several  cellular  com-
partments in K562 cells. They found that only a tiny fraction 
of  exons  were  found  to  be  surrounded  completely  by  an 
unspliced intron in chromatin-associated RNA. This sug-
gests that splicing is already occurring during transcription 
[18,  29].  The  strong  enrichment  of  spliceosomal  small 
nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in the chromatin-associated frac-
tion  compared  with  other  fractions  also  supports  cotran-
scriptional  splicing.  These  observations  confirm  the  idea 
that  chromatin  structure  could  play  a  role  in  splicing  [7, 
30-34].  However,  for  alternative  exons  and  lncRNAs, 
splicing tends to occur later and might remain unspliced in 
some cases [29]. 

RNA editing 

Li et al. [35] reported 10,210 exonic sites in the human 

62

www.genominfo.org

genome where an RNA sequence did not match with the 
DNA sequence, suggestive of RNA editing. However, there 
have  been  debates  about  whether  their  observations 
occurred  by  sequencing  error,  gene  duplication,  mapping 
error, or read-end misalignment [36-38]. 

Park et al. [39] developed a pipeline to filter sequencing 
artifacts  in  identifying RNA editing.  They found  that  the 
majority of non-A-to-G variants came from incorrect read 
mapping  across  splice  junctions.  Most  of  the  edits  they 
found  were  A-to-G(I)  variants,  which  corresponds  with 
recent observations [40] but differs from Li et al.’s report 
[35] of a substantial number of noncanonical single nucle-
otide variant edits in the RNA of human lymphoblastoid 
cells.  Most  A-to-G(I)  edits  were  located  in  introns  and 
untranslated  regions,  with  only  a  fraction  of  sites  repro-
ducibly edited across multiple cell lines. 

Pseudogenes 

Pseudogenes  have  been  considered  nonfunctional  se-
quences of genomic DNA that lost their coding potential due 
to disruptive mutations, such as frameshifts and premature 
stop  codons  [41-44].  Recent  studies  have  shown  that 
pseudogenes can regulate their parent genes [45-49]. Using 
manual  annotation,  with  the  assistance  of  computational 
pipelines, GENCODE created a database called Pseudogene 
Decoration Resource (psiDR). psiDR provides a variety of 
information on 11,216 peudogenes, including transcription 
activity, chromatin features, functional genomics, and evo-
lutionary constraints [50]. Transcribed pseudogenes show 
enhanced  chromatin  accessibility  and  enrichment  with 
histone marks, although they are lower than those of coding 
genes. The majority of pseudogenes contains no or very few 
transcription  factor  binding  sites  (TFBSs),  but  the  diffe-

rences between the number of TFBSs associated with tran-
scribed and nontranscribed pseudogenes are significant. 

Small RNAs 

GENCODE also categorized 7,054 small RNAs into 2,756 
micro  RNAs  (miRNAs),  snRNAs,  small  nucleolar  RNAs 
(snoRNAs), and transfer RNAs (tRNAs). They found that 
miRNAs and tRNAs were abundant in cytosol, snoRNAs 
were in the nucleus, and snRNAs were in both the nucleus 
and  cytosol.  snRNAs  were  found  abundantly  in  the

fractions,  which 

Enhancer RNAs 

RNAs at enhancers (eRNAs) were first characterized by 
observing  transcription  activities  at  the  promoter-distal 
CREB  binding  protein-binding  sites  in  mouse  cortical 
neurons [51]. The bidirectional property of eRNAs and their 
association with gene expression were further studied using 
nascent  RNAs  from  global  run-on  sequencing  (GROseq) 
data [52, 53]. ENCODE used RNA assays to detect tran-
scription  activity.  Besides  the  bidirectional  property, 
ENCODE  identified  transcriptional  initiation  using  cap 
analysis gene expression (CAGE) [54] signals. Interestingly, 
they found polyadenylated eRNAs, although most eRNAs 
were prevalent in the nonpolyadenylated form. They also 
observed that histone marks associated with eRNAs were 
the  factors  for  transcriptional  initiation  and  elongation: 
H3K27ac, H3K79me2, and RNA polymerase. These lines of 
evidence suggest regulatory functions of eRNAs.

Predicting  Gene  Expression  by  Chromatin 
Features

Enabled by the unprecedented volume of data generated 
by the ENCODE project, Dong et al. [57] performed a very 
interesting study that attempted to predict gene expression 
from chromatin features using machine learning techniques. 
As usually practiced, a machine learning study is composed 
of a series of procedures that typically involve data collection, 
data  representation,  model  building,  and  testing.  Using 
machine learning terminology, the response variables here 
are  gene  expression  patterns  that  are  predicted/modeled, 
while  the  predictors  or  features  are  various  chromatin 
measures.  Chromatin  data  were  collected  from  the 
ENCODE  project  with  11  chromatin  modifications,  one 
histone variant, and DNase I hypersensitivity, all mapped in 
seven cell lines (Table 3). Gene expression data were from 
different cellular compartments, using two different RNA 
isolation approaches and sequenced with different techno-
logies (Table 3). With such diversity of RNA sources, Dong 
et al. [57] answered not only the general question of whether 
gene expression can be predicted with satisfactory accuracy 
but also the questions of whether different RNA sources that 
are  sequenced  by  different  technologies  can  be  predicted 
differently using the same chromatin features.

The gene expression data are relatively easy to represent. 
They were separated into two classes: transcriptional start 
site  (TSS)-based  and  transcript-based  (Tx-based).  TSS- 
based  expression  data  are  read  counts  within  a  101-bp 
window  centered  on  the  TSS,  which  measures  trans-
criptional  initiation.  Tx-based  expression  data  are  sum-
marized read counts from the whole transcript, which mea-
sures  transcriptional  elongation.  However,  the  represen-
tation  of  chromatin  data  seems  to  be  tricky  and  requires 
further  research.  Dong  et  al.  [57]  used  a  strategy  called 
“bestbin,” which considers the chromatin signals across the 
entire gene body, including 2-kb flanking regions. It basically 
segregates each genic region into equal bins of 100 bp and 
summarizes the chromatin signals within each. A training 
dataset was used to identify the bin that correlates most with 
gene  expression,  and  the  learned  parameter  values  were 
applied to testing data. Other strategies [58, 59] are pos-
sible, but the “bestbin” strategy was found to be superior 
[57]. 

RNA sequencing data are known to contain very little or 
no  background  noise,  with  a  large  portion  of  the  genes 
having  0  read  counts.  Therefore,  the  response  variables 
become a mixture of a 0 component and a positive counting 
component.  Neither  a  classifier  nor  regression  method 
seems to be able to capture the variability of both. To deal 
with the challenge, a two-step approach was used by [57], so 

that  a  classifier  first  categorized  genes  as  “expressed”  or 
“unexpressed,”  Then,  a  regression  method  was  used  to 
predict the expression levels of the expressed genes. The 
final  prediction  is  the  product  of  the  classifier  and  the 
regression method.

To test the performance of their approach, each dataset 
was separated into a training set and a testing set. On the 
training set, the “best bin” and a few other parameters were 
determined. After that, a 10-fold crossvalidation was per-
formed on the testing set to evaluate the model. AUC [60] 
was  used  to  represent  the  accuracy  of  the  classifier.  Two 
criteria were used to represent the accuracy of the regression 
method. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to 
measure  the  similarity  between  the  predicted  value  and 
experimental  value.  Root  mean  square  error  was  used  to 
measure  the  disparity  between  the  predicted  value  and 
experimental value.

Overall,  the  two-step  model  achieved  very  satisfactory 
performance, with a PCC ＞ 0.9 for a number of datasets and 
a PCC ＞ 0.8 for 71% of the whole data. Looking at the two 
steps  separately,  the  AUC  can  be as high as 0.95  for  the 
classifier,  and  the  PCC  can  be  as  high  as  0.77  for  the 
regression  method  when  predicting  CAGE-measured 
polyA+  cytosolic  RNA  expression  in  K562  cells.  Similar 
performance  was  achieved  in  other  datasets.  It  was  also 
found that H3K9ac and H3K4me3 are the most important 
predictors  for  the  classifier,  strengthening  their  roles  as 
activation  marks  at  TSSs.  In  contrast,  H3K79me2  and 
H3K36me3  are  the  most  important  predictors  for  the 
regression methods, strengthening their roles as elongation 
marks at gene bodies. These findings show that the two-step 
model not only improved the accuracy of prediction but also 
enabled the identification of the chromatin features that are 
associated with different transcriptional roles.

Discussion

During the past decade, the ENCODE project has evolved 
into a genomewide scale, and the dataset it generated has 
expanded  in  quantity  as  well  as  in  scope.  The  ENCODE 
project has provided a global view about the human tran-
scriptome and most noticeably found that the transcribed 
region  of  the  human  genome  is  more  abundant  than  we 
previously thought. This finding significantly reduced the 
so-called  intergenic  regions,  as  defined  in  the  traditional 
sense.  The  quantitative  measurement  of  RNA  species  in 
several  cellular  compartments  as  well  as  their  polyade-
nylation provided a comprehensive view of RNA generation. 
In this review, we have revisited the characteristics of both 
coding and noncoding transcripts in association with their 
structures and locations in cells.

Besides  the  human  transcriptome  and  the  associated 
chromatin  modification  data  that  we  discussed,  the 
ENCODE  consortium  also  mapped  transcription  factor 
binding sites and their associated DNA motifs, as well as 
DNA methylation and long-range chromosomal interactions 
[4]. In parallel, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project (http:// 
www.roadmapepigenomics.org)  and  International  Human 
Epigenome Consortium (http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org) 
have been accumulating data of a similar scale to understand 
the  human  genome  in  other  tissues  and  conditions.  It  is 
remarkable  that  the  ENCODE data  altogether  have  asso-
ciated more than 80% of the human genome with some type 
of biochemical function so far, and the coverage will continue 
to increase as we map additional protein-DNA interactions 
in  the  near  future.  It  has  now  become  very  clear  that 
so-called “junk DNA” is not evolutionarily vestigial but has 
specific structural or biochemical functions. 

While data generation has been a major goal of ENCODE, 
the need to integrate the current datasets is becoming more 
and more important. Computational approaches have been 
developed  to  exploit  the  ENCODE  data  at  to  a  fuller 
potential.  For  instance,  chromatin  features  were  used  to 
model gene expression [57, 61]; integrative methods were 
developed to annotate genomes [62-64]; visualization tools 
were  developed  to  investigate  epigenomic  regulation  at  a 
global  scale  (also  see  ngs.plot  at  https://code.google. 
com/p/ngsplot/)  [65,  66];  and  large  regulatory  networks 
were reconstructed, based on TFs and DNaseI footprinting 
[67, 68]. The network-based approach as well as the chro-
mosomal interactions [69] provided novel angles in studying 
gene  regulation  at  higher  levels.  New  approaches  to 
integrate the large amount of data to provide new biological 
insights are on the horizon.
