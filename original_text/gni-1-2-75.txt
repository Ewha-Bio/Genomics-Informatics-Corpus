Abstract 

Every protein can  be characterized by either a distinct motif 
or  a combination  of  motifs.  Nevertheless,  little  is  known 
about the  relationships  among  (more  than  two)  the  motifs. 
Some  of  the  proteins  in  the  world  are  share  motifs  for 
evolutional  or  other  biological  benefits  - they  can  save 
energy,  time  and  resource  for  controlling  and  managing  a 
variety of proteins.  In some cases of motifs, the tendency is 
quite common and they can act the 'hub' motif of a network 
of  the  motif  associations.  The  hubs  are  structurally  and 
functionally  important  in  themselves  and  also  important  in 
disease-related  mutations.  They  will  be  highly  resistant 
mutation  to  conserve  their functions.  But,  in  case  of the  a 
rare  mutation,  mutations  on  the  position  of  hub  can  more 
easily cause fatal diseases.

Introduction 

To  understand  the  biological  activities  of  a cell,  it  is 
essential to characterize the functions of the proteins in that 
specific cell.  From  a particular function  of  a protein,  there 
can  be  complex  biological  processes.  Among  many 
approaches for protein  characterization,  there  is  a method 
using the proteins'  basic building units - amino acids. 

As  the  size  of  protein  sequence  database  grows,  it 
becomes  more  powerful  to  predict  proteins' functions  by 
sequence comparison  and there have been those kinds of 
works.  In this paper,  we  used the  protein sequence motifs

that  are  representative  features  of  a protein  and  their 
functions  rather than  comparing  whole  protein  sequences 
(we  are  going  to  use  the  term  'motif  as  a concept  that 
includes  'functional  domain'  ).  Every  protein  can  be 
characterized  by  either a distinct motif or a combination  of 
motifs.  And,  to  understand  motif  association  is  crucial  for 
understanding  the  nature  and  the  extent  of  biochemical 
functions (Deng eta/., 2002). 

Moreover,  motif  combinations  are  interesting  because 
combining  with  other  motifs,  a motif  can  show  more 
complicated and specified function to a protein. 

Nevertheless,  little  is  known  about  the  relationships 
among  (more than two) the motifs. There are several motif 
finding  algorithms  and  protein  motif databases  such  as 
PROSITE  (Fiaquet  eta/.,  2002),  PRINTS  (Attwood  et a/., 
2003),  PFAM  (Bateman eta/., 2002) and SMART (Letunic 
eta/., 2002) using those algorithms.  In this paper, we use d 
the  lnterPro  database  (Mulder  et a/.,  2003)  that  provides 
integrated  and  non-redundant  protein-to-motif  data  and 
found  association  rules  on  the  motifs  using  a data  mining 
algorithm. 

Some  of  the  protein  in  the  world  share  motifs  for 
evolutional  or  other  biological  benefits  - they  can  save 
energy,  time  and  resource  for controlling  and  managing  a 
variety of  proteins.  In  some  of the  motifs,  the  tendency  of 
sharing  is  quite  common  and  they  can  act  as  the  'hub' 
motif  for  a network  of  motif  associations.  The  hubs  are 
structurally  and  functionally  important  in  themselves  and 
are  also  important  in  disease-related  mutations.  They  are 
highly resistant to conserve their functions.  But,  in the case 
of a rare  mutation  on  the  position  of  hub  can  more  easily 
cause fatal diseases. 

In  this  paper,  we  obtained  association  rules  among  the 
protein sequence motifs, and the found hub motifs from the 
networks that were  construct from  the  rules.  After that,  we 
examined  structures  of the  motif-containing  proteins  and 
searched the disease-related databases. 

Association rule mining 

Association  rule  mining  finds  interesting  association  or 
correlation  relationships  among  a large  set  of  data  items. 
With massive amounts of data continuously being collected 
and  stored,  many  industries  are  becoming  interested  in 
mining  association  rules  from  their  databases.  A typical 
example  of  association  rule  mining  is  market  basket 
analysis. 

76  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1 (2) 75-79, December 2003 

Basic concepts 
Let  J  =  {il, iz, · · · im}  be  a set  of  items  (Han  and  Kamber, 
2001 ).  Let D,  the task-relevant data,  be  a set of  database 
transaction where each transaction T is a set of items such 
that  T~J. Each transaction  is associated with  an  identifier, 
called TID. LetA be a set of items. A transaction Tis said to 
contain  A  if  and  only  if A~T. An  association  rule  is  an 
implication of the form A=::;B, where AcJ, Bel, and A nB= 
0 . The  rule  A=::;B  holds  in  the  transaction  set  D  with 
support  s,  where  s  is  the  percentage  of transactions  in  D 
that contain AU B  (i.e.,  both A  and  B).  This  is  taken  to  be 
the probability, P(A UB). The rule A=::;B has confidence c in 
the transaction  set D  if c is  the  percentage of transactions 
in D containing A that also contain B. This is taken to be the 
conditional probability, P(BIA). That is, 

Support(A=::;B) = P(AUB) 
Confidence(A=::;B) = P(BIA) 

Association  rule  mined  using  a support-confidence 
framework  are  useful  for  many applications.  However,  the 
support-confidence framework can  be  misleading  in  that it 
may  identify  a rule A=::;B  as  interesting  when,  in  fact,  the 
occurrence  of A  does  not  imply the  occurrence  of B.  The 
occurrence  of  itemset A  is  independent of the  occurrence 
of itemset B if P(A UB)= P(A)P(B);  otherwise itemset A and 
B  are  dependent and  correlated  as  events.  This  definition 
can  easily  be  extended  to  more  than  two  itemsets.  The 
correlation ( 'lift'  in this paper) between the occurrence of A 
and B can be measured by computing, 

Lift= Corr A,B = P(A UB)I(P(A)*P(B)) 

Association rule study in bioinformatics 
Recently,  there  have  been  some  approaches  in  biological 
fields  with  association  rule  mining.  The  subjects  are 
protein-protein  interaction,  micro-array  data  analysis, 
literature-based  gene  identification  and  intra-protein  motifs 
like ours (Horng et at.,  2002). The  intra-protein  motif study 
was  actually a correlation  study.  The  association  rules  did 
not  shown  in  the  paper  and  there  wasn'  t  interesting 
analysis about the causal correlations, neither. 

Differences  from  classification  and  correlation 
mining 
Knowledge  discovery through  the  association  rule  mining 
method  is  quite  different from  the  classification  method. 
Though  the  rules  that  are  generated  from  a decision  tree 
can  be  look  like  the  general  association  rules,  there  are 
more than  two  statistical  values  only for association  rules. 
As we  mentioned  before,  association  rules are considered 

interesting  if  they  satisfy  both  a minimum  support  and  a 
minimum confidence threshold. And more over, the  values 
make it possible to obtain the non-deterministic  'tendency' 
of  rules  that  can  be  opportunities  for  finding  new 
information. 

Mining  association  is  also  different from  the  correlation 
study.  Association  rules  are  built  based  on  pre-measured 
correlation  and  given statistical  meaning with those values 
like support and confidence.  Association  rules  can  include 
all of the information in correlations with the  'lift'  value and 
can  reproduce  the  correlations  of  themselves.  And,  the 
association  rules  can  provide  new  information  about the 
relationships of motifs. 

Material & Method 
Materials 
We used the Swiss-Prot protein sequence database (v41.0) 
and the lnterPro database (v6.0). The lnterPro database has 
the  integrated  and  non-redundant protein-to-motif data 
(Table 1). 

Methods 
For extracting  the  associations  among  the  protein  motifs, 
we used IBM Intelligent Miner for Data. The protein-to-motif 
data were built from the lnterPro database with IDs to DB2. 
And,  we  set  the  minimum  threshold  values  both  a 
minimum  support  (0.06%)  and  a minimum  confidence 
(50%). 

An example 
Here  is  an  association  rule  simplified  form  of  the  real 
association  rules  of  the  motif  data;  (m1AmzA · · .Amk)  ~ mk+1. 
Symbol  mi  means a protein  motif,  and the  arrow shows a 
subordinate  relationships  in  math.  Therefore,  the 
symbolized  association  rule,  (m1AmzA ... Amk)  ~ mk+J,  has 
meaning;  "if  one  or  more  motif(s)  m1,  mz,  · · ·,  mk  are  in  a 
protein, then the motif mk.mould exist in protein." 

Results 
Result of association rule mining 
There  were  141  networks  that  satisfied  both  a minimum 
support  (0.06%)  and  a minimum  confidence  (50%) 
threshold.  The  size of network varied from  group to  group 
and  the  largest  one  had  38  motifs,  the  smallest  one  had 
only 2 motifs. From them we selected the largest one (with 
38  motif  set)  as  example  of  these  networks.  More  than 
2,400  rules  were  consisted  that  network and  we  picked  a 
sub-network  by  choosing  a herb  motif  randomly  out for 
more sophisticate  study.  The  sub-network was  composed 
of 15 motifs and the hub of network was [IPR003593]: AAA

Motif annotation table {from lnterPro} 
lnterPro  is  an  integrated  documentation  resource  for 
protein  families,  domains  and  sites.  lnterPro  combines  a 
number of  databases  (referred  to  as  member  databases) 
that  use  different  methodologies  and  a varying  degree  of 
biological  information  on  the  well-characterized  proteins to 
derive  the  protein  signatures.  By  uniting  the  member 
databases,  lnterPro  capitalizes  on  their  individual 
strengths,  producing  a powerful  integrated  diagnostic  tool 
(Table 2).

protein family/subfamily relationships.  In all  cases a protein 
sequence  match  to  the  child  entry  implies  a match  to  the 
parent and signatures for the  parent and child entries must 
overlap.  And,  the  'contains/found  in'  relationship  is  used 
to indicate domain composition. 

Some  domains  can  be  found  in  more  than  one  type  of 
protein  or  family  of  proteins,  but  is  not  a subtype  in  the 
family sense. 

We  identified  four  overlapped  motifs:  [IPR001270], 
[IPR003960],  [IPR0019  84],  [IPR003439]  with  [IPR0035 
93].  And  they  represented  similar function,  'AlP-binding' 
which  is a kind of nucleotide. Moreover two more functional 
links  were  identified:  [IPR002197],  [IPR001140]  with 
[IPR003593]. [IPR002197] stands for helix-turn-helix, which

Structural view 
[IPR003593]  is  an  integrated  motif from  the  SMART 
database to  lnterPro.  It indicates [SM00382] in the SMART 
motif database.  From the structural information in  SMART, 
we  choose  a structure  (PDB  id:  1 BMF)  that  is  obtained 
from  an  ATPase  of  bovine.  We  mapped  [IPR003593] 
([SM000382]) into that structure using NCBI Cn3D tool and

Conclusion 

As we mentioned, the proteins in the world share motifs for 
evolutional  or  other  biological  benefits  - they  can  save 
energy, time  and  resource for controlling  and  managing  a 
variety  of  proteins.  The  hubs  are  structurally  and 
functionally important in themselves and are also important 
in  disease-related  mutations.  They  are  highly  resistant  to 
mutation to  conserve their functions.  But  in  the  case  of  a 
rare mutation, on the position of hub can more easily cause 
fatal diseases.  From  an  example of network, we  knew that 
there  could  be  several  'hub'  motifs.  The  hub  motifs  act 
'hubs'  in the computer network system and  are  important 
in  the  aspect of  structure  and  function  of  the  proteins.  As 
we  have  shown,  the  mutations  (ex.  missense  mutation  in 
OMIM)  in  these  hub  motifs  can  cause  serious  biological 
malfunction or disease to whole organism. 

The major problem of this kind of network building is the 
redundancy control.  The traditional  association  rule  mining 
framework  produces  many  redundant  rules.  So,  we  are 
trying to  solve  this problem  and are  planning to  build  non(cid:173)
redundant networks among motifs using that solution. 

One  of  the  other  problems,  there  are  reasonable
