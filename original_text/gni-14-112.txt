Solid tumor is generally observed in tissues of epithelial or endothelial cells of lung, breast, prostate, pancreases, colorectal, 
stomach, and bladder, where several genes transcription is regulated by the microRNAs (miRNAs). Argonaute (AGO) protein 
is  a  family  of  protein  which  assists  in  miRNAs  to  bind  with  mRNAs  of  the  target  genes.  Hence,  study  of  the  binding 
mechanism between AGO protein and miRNAs, and also with miRNAs-mRNAs duplex is crucial for understanding the RNA 
silencing mechanism. In the current work, 64 genes and 23 miRNAs have been selected from literatures, whose deregulation 
is well established in seven types of solid cancer like lung, breast, prostate, pancreases, colorectal, stomach, and bladder 
cancer. In silico study reveals, miRNAs namely, miR-106a, miR-21, and miR-29b-2 have a strong binding affinity towards 
PTEN, TGFBR2, and VEGFA genes, respectively, suggested as important factors in RNA silencing mechanism. Furthermore, 
interaction  between  AGO  protein  (PDB  ID-3F73,  chain  A)  with  selected  miRNAs  and  with  miRNAs-mRNAs  duplex  were 
studied computationally to understand their binding at molecular level. The residual interaction and hydrogen bonding are 
inspected  in  Discovery  Studio  3.5  suites.  The  current  investigation  throws  light  on  understanding  miRNAs  based  gene 
silencing mechanism in solid cancer.

Introduction

Cancer  has  a  complex  pathophysiology  unlike  other 
diseases.  The  development  of  cancer  is  attributed  to  a 
number  of  predisposing  factors  like  familial  and  genetic 
factors, racial and geographic factors and various epidemio-
logical factors like smoking, use of tobacco, diet, and certain 
type of infection.  Majority of the cancers occur in  ageing 
population [1], however there is a changing trend towards 
younger  population  in  recent  years.  The  uncontrolled 
division of cancer cells generally spreads to the other part of 
body  through  the  blood  and  lymphatic  systems.  In  this 
context, solid cancer which is an abnormal mass of tissue 
that  usually  does  not  contain  cysts  or  liquid  area  can  be 
either benign or malignant in nature. Such solid cancers are 
observed in tissues of epithelial or endothelial cells of lung, 

breast, prostate, pancreatic, colorectal, stomach, and bladder. 
Management  of  cancer  is  a  multimodality  approach  and 
includes surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted 
therapy with certain limitations of each approach. Research 
is  going  across  the  globe  for  the  management  of  cancer. 
Recently microRNAs (miRNAs) have drawn attention of the 
researchers to discover new insights into the treatment of 
cancer.  These  miRNAs  are  highly  conserved  non-coding 
single stranded RNAs (∼18 to 22 bp) that target mRNA at 
3' un-translated region of protein coding genes and act as 
natural  inhibitor.  These  miRNAs  participate  in  several 
biological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, 
metabolism,  and  apoptosis  and  are  also  involved  in  the 
regulation of gene expression [2]. However, in development 
of pathologies like cancer, deregulation of miRNAs expression 
has  been  identified  as  potential  area  to  be  studied.  The 
miRNAs have special signature and variation from normal

cells [3]. Hence, use of specific miRNAs as biomarker may be 
applied  for  cancer  diagnosis  and  treatment.  Since  the 
expression of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are 
influenced by the miRNAs, provides scope to study their 
association  in  cancer  [3].  Collating  data  for  miRNAs 
signatures associated with solid tumors, it was reported that 
more  than  50%  of  miRNAs  genes  are  located  in  cancer 

associated  genomic  regions  or  in  fragile  sites,  suggesting 
that miRNAs play  a crucial  role in the pathogenesis of a 
limited range of human cancers than previously expected 
[4]. Considering their influence on the cancer cell phenotype, 
some miRNAs are considered to be oncogenic, and others to 
be tumor-suppressive [5]. Few miRNAs are well characterized 
in cancer association such as miR-21, miR-17-5p, miR-191,

miR-221, miR-106a, miR-126, and miR-31 (Supplementary 
Table 1) that are involved in either up regulation or down 
regulation of many genes [42-58]. Till date various resear-
chers have explored the unusual expression of miRNAs, and 
its prognostic significance in various human malignancies. 
Hence,  to  study  the  relationship  between  miRNAs  and 
cancer, it is important to examine the expression profile of 
miRNAs and their target genes in different cancer types. As 
a case study, the unusual expression of miRNA-21 has been 
conformed in various cancers such as lung, breast, prostate, 
colorectal,  pancreatic,  bladder,  and  stomach  cancer,  and 
interestingly  the  oncogenic  like  function  of  miRNA-21  is 
mediated  through  the  expression  of  its  target  genes  like 
PDCD4,  PTEN,  and  TGFBR2  which  are  generally  tumor 
suppressor genes in nature [59]. Though miRNAs control 
the  gene  expression  to  some  extent  during  translation 
process but the translational suppression mechanism is still 
controversial,  for  example  some  miRNAs  down-regulate 
while others up-regulate the gene expression. Hence, study 
of interaction mechanism between miRNAs and their target 

genes is essential. In the process of miRNAs mediated gene 
regulation, the Argonaute (AGO) class of proteins play a si-
gnificant role in the hybrid formation between miRNA-mRNA 
[60, 61]. Despite of several researches, controlling this abno-
rmal  cell  proliferation  selectively  in  different  cancer  by 
miRNAs as natural inhibitor is still a major challenge. In the 
present study, attempts have been made to develop a strategy 
for identification and selection of suitable miRNAs, their 
target genes associated in solid tumor, and as well as to study 
the role of AGO protein in their interaction at molecular level 
using computational tools and techniques. 

Methods
Screening of miRNAs and genes 

Extensive  literature  search  and  exploration  of  online 
databases were conducted to understand miRNAs mediated 
regulation  of  solid  cancer  associated  target  genes  using 
miRCancer  (http://mircancer.ecu.edu/)  and  miRDisease 
(http://mir2disease.org).  miRNAs  and  target  genes  were 
screened  by  following  two  criteria:  (1)  only  up  regulated 
oncogenes or down regulated tumor suppressor genes were 
selected and (2) the screening was performed by selecting

explored  and  inspected  using  miRTarbase  web  server 
(http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/).  Furthermore,  the

Prediction of structural model of miRNA-mRNA 
complexes

To verify the folding affinity between selected miRNAs 
and their target genes, secondary structures were predicted 
using RNAfold web server (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/ 
RNAfold.cgi). The resulted dot bracketed structures of duplex

Results
Screening of miRNAs and genes associated with 
solid tumor

From the literature, 23 miRNAs were found to be involved 
in  seven  solid  tumors  namely;  lung,  breast,  colorectal, 
pancreatic,  prostate,  stomach,  and  bladder  [62].  Again 
through exploration of online databases 64 different target 
genes  (oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor  genes)  were 
observed  to  be  regulated  by  these  23  miRNAs  (Supp-
lementary Table 1). Again out of these seventeen miRNAs 

are suspected to be effectively involved in controlling the 
expression pattern of 45 target genes associated in seven 
solid tumors (Table 1) [6-41]. Further, binding affinity was 
explored using miRTarbase web server. Fifteen miRNAs and 
23 target genes were selected as per the availability of MFE 
score  (Supplementary  Table  2)  and  subjected  to  further 
study.  The  involvement  of  these  23  genes  in  different 
biological  functions  are  explored  and  inspected  from 
UniProt  web  server  (http://www.uniprot.org/).  It  was 
observed  only  PTEN,  TGFBR2,  and  VEGFA  genes  mostly

feration,  and  other  biological  functions  (Table  2,  Fig.  1). 
Further, the conservation in binding pattern among selected 
miRNAs and mRNAs (Table 3) were studied through sequence 
similarity algorithm using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi. 
ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) web server. The study revealed 
for  the  existence  of  quite  less  portion  of  conservation  at 
sequence  level  among  chosen  23  mRNAs  and  also  in  15 
miRNAs (Fig. 2), is not sufficient to throw light on binding 
patterns.  Therefore,  the  binding  affinity  was  evaluated 
between mRNA and miRNA at secondary structural level. 
Good MFE score suggested, the target genes PTEN, TGFBR2, 
and VEGFA are having a strong affinity towards miR-106a, 
miR-21, and miR-29b-2 (Table 3). Hence those genes and 
miRNAs  were  taken  into  consideration  to  study  their 
interaction at molecular level. 

Study of binding affinity between miRNA-mRNA 
duplex

Duplex sequences between miR-106 and PTEN, miR-21 
and TGFBR2, miR-29b-2 and VEGFA were extracted from 
miRTarbase web server and prediction of secondary folding 
pattern was performed in RNA fold. The secondary folding 
patterns along with their binding energy value are reported 
(Table 4). The predicted binding energy suggested for a high 
affinity among selected miRNA-mRNA duplexes. Predicted 
three  dimensional  models  [63]  of  the  duplex  structures 
between miR-106 and PTEN, miR-21 and TGFBR2, miR-29b-2 
and VEGFA also supported for strong molecular interaction 
between them.

Structure preparation of AGO protein

The  three-dimensional  crystallized  structure  of  AGO 
protein, with 685 amino acid residues was extracted from 
Protein Data bank (PDB ID: 3F73). The structure of AGO 
protein contains guide DNA and target RNA duplexes. All 
water  molecules  and  ligands  were  removed  from  the 
structure. As, the AGO protein is a homo dimer, out of two 
chains, only chain ‘A’ of AGO protein was considered and 
refined before  docking.  The  necessary  correction in bond 
order  and  bond  length  of  all  atoms  in  the  structure  was 
performed  using  prepare  protein  and  clean  geometry 
protocol of Discovery Studio 3.5.

complexes. Out of 10 different poses resulted for docking 
complexes  in  Patch  Dock  server,  the  pose  with  highest 
geometrical shape complementary score [64] is considered 
as the best docked complex. The resulted geometrical shape 
complementary score and atomic contact energy scores are 
reported  (Table  5),  implicated  a  strong  binding  affinity 
between the miRNAs and AGO protein. The binding affinity 
between the AGO protein and miRNAs (miR-106a, miR-21, 
and miR-29b-2) is established through the observation of 
amino acids (miR-106a: LEU 132, ALA 133, VAL 152, LEU 
153, ALA 170, ILE 173, LEU 267, LEU 279, ALA 479,VAL

ALA 648, LEU 652, ALA 659, LEU 662, and VAL 663) which 
are strongly hydrophobic in nature and also amino acids with 
aromatic rings (miR-106a: TYR 135, TYR 171, TRP415, and 
PHE 487; miR-21: TYR 135, TYR 171, TRP 415, TYR 642, 
PHE 647, and PHE 649; miR-29b-2: TRP 156, TRP 415, TYR 
642, PHE 647, and PHE649) within a distance of 3.5Å (Table 
6, Fig. 4). The presence of hydrogen bonding pattern during 
interaction (Table 7, Fig. 5) also supported the fact of AGO 
protein driven miRNA based gene regulation.

Study of molecular interaction between AGO 
protein and miRNA-mRNA duplex

The second round docking was performed between AGO 
protein and miRNA-mRNA duplexes (miR-106 and PTEN; 
miR-21 and TGFBR2; and miR-29b-2 and VEGFA) separately 
in PatchDock web server, and scores are reported (Table 8). 
Amino acids which are strong hydrophobic in nature and 
amino  acids  with  aromatic  rings  which  are  relatively 
hydrophobic generally contribute a lot towards the stability 
of binding during molecular interaction between two macro 
molecules.  Hence  the  molecular  interaction  between 
miRNA-mRNA duplexes and AGO protein was studied by 
inspecting close amino acid residues of AGO protein within 
a distant of 3.5 Å. Strong hydrophobic amino acids of AGO 
like VAL 152, LEU 153, VAL 264, LEU 265, LEU 267, LEU 
277, ALA 278, LEU 279, ALA 414, ILE 434, ALA 479, VAL 
663, and VAL 685 in miR-106a and PTEN duplex; LEU 45, 
LEU 46, ALA 47, VAL 49, ALA 50, ALA 80, ILE 173, LEU 
265, LEU 267, LEU 277, ALA 278, LEU 279, LEU 281, ALA 
479, ALA 644, ALA 648, LEU 652, and VAL 663 in miR-21 
and TGFBR2 duplex; and ALA 80, LEU 132, VAL 152, LEU

Discussion

The  current  study  focused  on  in  silico  identification  of 
genes  and  their  regulation  mediated  through  miRNAs, 
involved  in  seven  types  of  solid  tumors  of  colorectal, 
pancreatic,  breast,  stomach,  lung,  prostate,  and  bladder. 
miRNAs have a crucial role in gene silencing mechanism 
observed through the altered expression of certain miRNA 
molecules  in  case  of  neurodegenerative  diseases  such  as 

Alzheimer  and  Parkinson  suggesting  that  the  association 
between mRNA-miRNA-AGO, therefore not cancer specific 
[16,  65].  The  association  between  mRNA-miRNA-AGO 
pattern has been reported [16, 65, 66] in RNA based gene 
silencing mechanism and their association at atomic level 
has already been studied in case of leukemia [25]. In this 
context,  molecular  association  between  AGO  protein, 
miRNAs  and  mRNAs  of  target  genes  were  studied  and 
analyzed in case of seven types of solid tumor. Sixty-four 
genes and  23  miRNAs  were collected  from the literature 
(Supplementary  Table  1),  out  of  which  45  genes  and 
seventeen  miRNAs  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  their 
expression pattern (Table 1). The affinity in binding modes 
between 15 miRNAs and 23 genes was verified, basing on 
the  availability  of  MFE  scores  in  miRTarbase  web  server 
(Supplementary  Table  2).  Further,  different  biological 
activities  of  selected  genes  were  studied  using  UniProt 
database (http://www.uniprot.org/) to screen out important 
genes and their contribution towards seven types of solid 
tumors.  The  observation  suggested  three  genes  namely, 
PTEN,  TGFBR2,  and  VEGFA  were  involved  in  different 
biological activities like angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, 
and cell proliferation, are the major contributing factor in 
oncogenesis (Table 2). However, quite less sequence con-
servation was observed within the binding site of 23 target

miR-29b-2, respectively, suggested for appropriate miRNAs 
selection for PTEN, TGFBR2, and VEGFA genes (Table 3), 
supported  by  the  predicted  binding  energy  scores  for 
miRNA-mRNA duplex structures (Table 4). Furthermore, to 
study the molecular basis of AGO protein driven miRNAs 
namely, miR-106a, miR-21, and miR-29b-2 having highest 
binding  affinity  towards  their  regulating  genes  namely, 
PTEN,  TGFBR2,  and  VEGFA  respectively,  the  molecular 
docking study was carried out. Generally, presence of amino 
acids  with  aliphatic  group  namely,  alanine  (ALA),  valine 
(VAL),  leucine  (LEU),  and  isoleucine  (ILE),  are  strongly 
hydrophobic in nature provides stability during molecular 
interaction between macro molecules, whereas amino acids 
namely, phenylalanine (PHE), tyrosine (TYR), tryptophan 
(TRP), are relatively hydrophobic in nature, but the presence 
of aromatic ring like structure provides a steadiness towards 
binding stability within the structural moiety of a protein. 
The observation of amino acids (miR-106a: LEU 132, ALA 
133, VAL 152, LEU 153, ALA 170, ILE 173, LEU 267, LEU 
279, ALA 479,VAL 620, VAL 663, VAL 666, and ILE 671; 
miR-21: ILE 173, VAL 264, LEU 267, LEU 279, ALA 354, 
ALA  414,  ILE  434,  ALA  644,  ALA  648,  and  VAL  685; 
miR-29b-2: VAL 152, LEU 153, ALA 170, LEU 279, ALA 
414, ALA 479, LEU 596, VAL 620, ALA 648, LEU 652, ALA 
659, LEU 662, and VAL 663) which are strongly hydrophobic 
in nature and amino acids with aromatic rings (miR-106a: 
TYR 135, TYR 171, TRP 415, and PHE 487; miR-21: TYR 
135, TYR 171, TRP 415, TYR 642, PHE 647, and PHE 649; 
miR-29b-2:  TRP  156,  TRP  415,  TYR  642,  PHE  647,  and 
PHE649) during interaction within a distance of 3.5Å (Table 
6, Fig. 4) recognized a strong molecular interaction between 
AGO protein and miR-106a, miR-21, and miR-29b-2. Again, 
weak  interaction  like  hydrogen  bonding  has  a  major 
contribution to facilitate the stability of molecules during 
interaction at atomic level. Here, the amino acids like, LEU 
153, PRO 169, TYR 171, GLU 416, PHE 487, ARG 574, and 
ARG 615; ARG 172, THR 201, LEU 279, ALA 354, GLN355, 
PRO 412, MET 413, TRP 415, ARG 418, ASN 436, ARG 615, 
ALA 644, ARG 661, and ARG 668; LYS 101, ARG 114, ASP 
159, PRO 412, ALA 414, ASP 478, LYS 575, ARG 580, ARG 
580, GLU 597, ASP 598, ARG 615, ALA 648, ASP 660, and 
ARG 661 are participated in hydrogen bonding interaction 
with miR-106a, miR-21, and miR-29b-2 respectively in the 
structural moiety of AGO protein within a distance of 2.5Å 
(Table  7,  Fig.  5),  strongly  supports  for  binding  stability 
during assistance of AGO protein for miRNA based gene 
regulation. Furthermore, presence of commonly participating 
strong hydrophobic amino acids namely, VAL 663 and amino 
acid with aromatic rings namely, TYR 43, TRP 415, and TYR 
642  during  molecular  interaction  of  AGO  protein  with 
miR-106a and PTEN, miR-21 and TGFBR2, and miR-29b-2 

and VEGFA duplex within a distance of 3.5Å (Table 9, Fig. 6). 
Although,  the  evidence  at  molecular  association  between 
mRNA-miRNA-AGO pattern have already been established 
computationally  [16,  61]  the  current  investigation  reco-
mmending  for  AGO  protein  assistance  in  regulation  of 
PTEN, TGFBR2, and VEGFA genes by miR-106a, miR-21, and 
miR-29b-2, respectively, associated in seven types of solid 
tumor.  This  report  would  be  helpful  in  understanding 
miRNA-based gene silencing mechanisms in seven types of 
solid cancer like colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast 
cancer,  stomach  cancer,  lung  cancer,  prostate  cancer,  and 
bladder cancer. Furthermore, extensive computational study 
may be carried out for better understanding the mechanism 
of  miRNAs  based  gene  regulation  in  solid  cancer.  This 
methodology  would  further  help  us  to  design  suitable 
miRNAs  against  respective  genes  rationally,  only  after 
validation through laboratory experiments.
