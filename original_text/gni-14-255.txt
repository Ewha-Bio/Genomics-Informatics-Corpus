The plethora of genome sequence information of bacteria in recent times has ushered in many novel strategies for anti-
bacterial drug discovery and facilitated medical science to take up the challenge of the increasing resistance of pathogenic 
bacteria to current antibiotics. In this study, we adopted subtractive genomics approach to analyze the whole genome 
sequence of the Fusobacterium nucleatum, a human oral pathogen having association with colorectal cancer. Our study 
divulged 1,499 proteins of F. nucleatum, which have no homolog’s in human genome. These proteins were subjected to 
screening further by using the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) that resulted in the identification of 32 vitally important 
proteins for the bacterium. Subsequent analysis of the identified pivotal proteins, using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and 
Genomes (KEGG) Automated Annotation Server (KAAS) resulted in sorting 3 key enzymes of F. nucleatum that may be good 
candidates as potential drug targets, since they are unique for the bacterium and absent in humans. In addition, we have 
demonstrated the three dimensional structure of these three proteins. Finally, determination of ligand binding sites of the 2 
key proteins as well as screening for functional inhibitors that best fitted with the ligands sites were conducted to discover 
effective novel therapeutic compounds against F. nucleatum.

Introduction

Fusobacterium  nucleatum  is  a  gram-negative  anaerobic 
bacterium which plays vital role in the architecture of oral 
biofilms.  This  dominant  oral  bacterium  is  very  much 
associated  with  periodontitis,  a  very  common  infectious 
disease  worldwide.  F.  nucleatum  also  affects  some  other 
bodily infections such as peritonsillar abscesses, endocar-
ditis, skin ulcers, and septic arthritis [1-4]. Coincidentally, it 
may  cause  severe  infections  in  a  child’s  body.  In  many 
studies, F. nucleatum is appeared to be related with preterm 
birth and has been found in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and 
chorioamnionic membranes of women delivering ahead of 
time. Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality 
and morbidity, accounting for 7% to 11% of all births in the 

United States alone [5]. Moreover, many studies have linked 
F. nucleatum with colorectal cancer; in addition, a mechanism 
has been reported by which F. nucleatum promotes colonic 
tumor formation without following the usual mechanism of 
instigating colonic inflammation or otherwise irritating the 
colon tissue and thereby demonstrating a direct and specific 
colonic carcinogenesis [6, 7]. 

Appropriate  antibiotic  therapy  and  surgical  drainage 
constitute  the  basis  for  treating  fusobacterial  infections. 
However, the emergence of multidrug resistant strains of F. 
nucleatum has made it difficult to guide the choice of empiric 
treatment.  The  first  case  of  resistance  to  penicillin  by 
fusobacteria  was  reported  in  the  mid-1980s.  There  is 
evidence  of  an  increased  frequency  of  β-lactamase  pro-
duction  by fusobacteria [8].  The incidence  of widespread 
resistance of Fusobacterium spp. to erythromycin and other

macrolides has been reported as well [9]. Though antibiotics 
like clindamycin, chloramphenicol, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, 
cefamandole  [10],  and  amoxicillin  [11]  are  shown  to  be 
active  against  this  pathogen,  ever  evolving  antibacterial 
resistance [12], chances of cross resistance [13], and the 
associated untoward effects of antibiotics [14] persistently 
urge the researchers to explore more promising and safer 
drug  targets.  More  importantly,  increasing  evidence  of 
association between Fusobacterium and colorectal cancer has 
even more intensified this urge.

In this context, this study aimed to explore some potential 
novel drug targets other than the aforementioned targets. 
We have adopted an approach focusing on two important 
criteria.  Firstly,  the  identified  target  protein  should  be 
indispensable for the survival of the pathogen. Secondly, the 
target protein should not be homologous to any protein of 
the human proteome. The nonhomolog property of these 

target proteins check the chance of the cross-reaction with 
the  human  host  and  thus  ascertains  highly  selective 
therapeutic  targets.  This  may  facilitate  minimizing  the 
adverse reactions of the prospective drug [15]. In this way, 
we have identified some potential drug targets which are not 
only human non-homologous essential proteins in unique 
metabolic pathway of the pathogen but also circumvent the 
resistant mechanism of current targets [16]. Moreover, we 
have predicted the three dimensional (3D) structure of these 
target  proteins  and  analyzed  ligand  binding  sites  and 
corresponding ligands of the best proteins to facilitate the 
search for novel drugs which might potentially arrest the 
growth of F. nucleatum.

nucleatum ATCC 25586 is illustrated in Fig. 1. 

Retrieval of the proteome of F. nucleatum

The complete proteome of F. nucleatum was retrieved in 
FAST alignment (FASTA) format from National Center for 
Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI;  http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/).

CD-HIT analysis 

The proteins were subjected to Cluster Database at High 
Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) analysis (http://weizhong-lab. 
ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/ index.cgi) [17]. The program 
takes  a  FASTA  format  sequence  database  as  input  and 
produces a set of non-redundant, representative sequences 
as  output.  The  process  was  carried  out  with  a  sequence 
identity cutoff of 0.6, thus eliminating redundant sequences 
with more than 60% identity [18-20]. The resultant proteins 
were grouped as Set1 proteome.

Elimination of human homologous proteins of 
F. nucleatum

Protein  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLASTP) 
analysis  (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)  was  ca-
rried out for the Set1 proteome against the proteome of Homo 
–4 
sapiens.  Proteins  with  an  E-value  (expectation  value)  10
were eliminated; assuming that they have a certain level of 
homology with the host genome [21]. The resultant data set 
(Set2 proteome) of F. nucleatum had no homology with the 
human proteome.

Identification of non-human homologous essential 
proteins in F. nucleatum

Then  the  Set2  proteome  was  subjected  to  BLASTP 
analysis  with  Database  of  Essential  Genes  (DEG;  http:// 
tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/),  which  contains  all  the  essential 
–100 was set as the 
genes currently available. An E-value of 10
cutoff value [22]. Thus, a Set3 proteome of F. nucleatum was 
obtained by grouping the proteins that showed an E-value 
–100. Set3 proteome contains the proteins of F. nucleatum 
10
that could be considered as novel drug targets because they 
are  not  present  in  the  host  and  are  involved  in  essential 
metabolic functions in the bacterium.

Metabolic pathway analysis

The  human  non-homologous  essential  proteins  of  F. 
nucleatum obtained through BLASTP were then subjected to 
metabolic  pathway  analysis,  which  was  done  by  Kyoto 
Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG)  Automatic 
Annotation  Server  (KAAS;  http://www.genome.jp/tools/ 
kaas/) [23] at KEGG [24]. The server provides functional

annotation of genes by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool 
(BLAST) comparisons against the manually curated KEGG 
GENES  database.  The  result  contains  KEGG  Orthology 
(KO)  assignments  and  automatically  generated  KEGG 
pathways.

Unique pathway identification

After  this,  unique  metabolic  pathways  of  Fusobacterium 
nucleatum  subsp.  nucleatum  ATCC25586  were  identified 
through  the  comparison  of  metabolic  pathways  of  both 
Fusobacterium  nucleatum  subsp.  nucleatum  ATCC25586  and 
Homo sapiens by using KEGG Genome Database [25]. Among 
unique  metabolic  pathways  of  only  those  proteins  were 
identified  which  were  human  non-homologue  essential 
proteins.

Sub-cellular localization of unique essential 
metabolic proteins

The  program  PSORTb  V.3.0  (http://www.psort.org/ 
psortb/index.html), CELLO (http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/), 
and  SOSUI  (http://bp.nuap.nagoya-u.ac.jp/sosui/sosui_ 
submit.html) server was used to characterize whether the 
proteins  are  soluble  or  trans-membrane  in  nature.  This 
computational tool illustrates where the protein resides in 
the  cell.  So  if  the  protein  is  associated  with  the  cell 
membrane,  there  is  more  possibility  that  it  can  be 
highlighted as a potential therapeutic target [26, 27].

Homology modelling ofunique essential metabolic 
proteins

To predict the 3D structure of unique essential metabolic 
proteins,  homology  modelling  was  done  by  the  server 
Protein  Homology/Analogy  Recognition  Engine (Phyre2). 
The retrieved amino acid sequence in FASTA format was 
used as input data in Phyre2 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/ 
phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index). In this respect, the inten-
sive mode of protein modeling was selected in order to get an 
accurate model.

Model refinement

Homology based modeling often contain significant local 
distortions, including steric clashes, unphysical phi/psi an-
gles and irregular H-hydrogen bonding networks, which re-
nder the structure models less useful for high-resolution fu-
nctional analysis. Refinement of structures could be a solu-
tion of this problem [28]. To refine the predicted model Mod-
Refiner (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/); 
an algorithm for atomic-level, high-resolution protein str-
ucture refinement is used.

Verification and validation of the predicted 3D 
model 

To  check  the  accuracy  of  the  predicted  3D  structures, 
Protein  Data  Bank  Summary  (PDBsum;  http://www. 
ebi.ac.uk/thorntonsrv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html) 
was used [29]. The PDBsum generated result was further 
subjected  to  documentation  analysis  by  PROgram  to 
CHECK  the  stereochemical  quality  of  protein  structures 
(PROCHECK) [30]. ERRAT algorithm (http://nihserver.mbi. 
ucla.edu/ERRAT/) helps in the assessment of the protein 
structure. Verify 3D (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/Verify_3D) 
Structure Evaluation Server was used for 3D profiling of the 
residue.  Qualitative  Model  Energy  Analysis  (QMEAN; 
http://swissmodel.expasy.org/qmean/cgi/index.cgi) was also 
done which is a composite scoring function that derives both 
global and local error estimates on the basis of one single 
model.  Global  error  is  estimated  for  entire  structure  and 
local one for per residue error.

Prediction of ligand binding sites and corresponding 
ligands 

Once  the  final  model  of  our  best  considered  predicted 
proteins was built, the possible ligand binding sites and their

corresponding ligands were revealed using COACH (http:// 
zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/),  a  meta-server 
approach  which  uses  BioLip  database  for  predicting  pro-
tein-ligand binding site [31]. 

Verification of the pharmaco-chemical properties of 
the best predicted ligands 

The pharmaco-chemical properties of the best predicted 
ligands  were  retrieved  from  the  DrugBank  Database 
(http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/) to demonstrate them as 
potential inhibitors of the best considered target proteins.

Results

Among a total of 4,630 proteins of Fusobacterium nucleatum 
strain ATCC 25586, 2,639 proteins were nullified. In effect, 
we  found  1,991  proteins  as  non-paralogous.  BLASTP 
screening of these proteins against the Homo sapiens genome 
results in 1,499 proteins which were non-homologous to 
human proteome. 

Furthermore,  the  1499  host  non-homologous  proteins 
were  then  screened  through  DEG  with  an  E-value  cutoff 
–100  revealing  32  essential  proteins.  The  DEG 
score  of  10
houses the records of presently available essential genes of a 
number of organisms. 

With  a  view  to  identify  the  metabolic  function  of  32 
essential  proteins,  metabolic  pathway  was  analyzed  by 
KAAS server at KEGG identifying a set of 30 proteins as 
putative  drug  targets.  After  that,  comparative  metabolic 
pathway  analysis  of  human  host  and  F.  nucleatum  was 
performed  at  KEGG  Genome  Database  [32,  33].  This 
comparison reveals 12 unique pathways which are present 
exclusively in F. nucleatum and among those 12 pathways 3 
non-human homologous essential proteins were found to be 
present on two different unique pathways. The results are 
shown in Table 1. Two out of three metabolic proteins are 
involved  in  phosphotransferase  system  (PTS)  and  one

sphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase, PTS system 
fructose-specific IIABC component, and UDP-N-acetylgluco-
samine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase was trans-membrane pro-
tein (Table 2, Fig. 2).

3D structures of the three unique and essential metabolic 
proteins were obtained by homology modeling using Phyre2 
(Fig. 3). 

ModRefiner derived refined model (Fig. 4) of phosphoe-
nolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase and UDP-N-acetyl-
glucosamine  1-carboxyvinyltransferase  were  analyzed.  In 
case of phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase in 
initial model the percent of residues in favored region were 
91.0% whereas 92.1% in the final model. Though in case of 
N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase amino acids 
residue in favored region were same in both the initial and 
final model but has a change in disallowed region, initially 

disallowed region had 0.5% residues and after refinement it 
narrowed down to 0.0%.

After  that,  PROCHECK  was  used  to  measure  the  ste-
reo-chemical quality of protein models at a resolution of 1.8. 
PROCHECK renders information about the protein chains 
and stereo-chemical properties such as Ramachandran plot 
quality,  peptide  bond  planarity,  bad  non-bonded  interac-
tions, main chain hydrogen bond energy, C alpha chirality 
and overall G factor [34]. Ramachandran plot regarding this 
analysis is shown in Fig. 5. 

Moreover, verification of the refinement was performed by 
Errat, QMEAN server, and Verify 3D. Errat is particularly 
appropriate  for  assessing  the  progress  of  crystallographic 
model  building  and  refinement.  Errat  showed  the  com-
parative  error  value  of  the  structured  model.  The  overall 
quality of model of phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phospho-

COACH generates protein-ligand binding site on the basis 
of two developed method (TM-SITE, based on binding-sp-
ecific substructure comparison and S-SITE, based on seq-
uence profile alignment) along with considering COFACTOR, 
FINDSITE, and CONCAVITY results. 
CONCAVITY results showed that a total number of 27 
residues (–196, 199, 281, 301, 303, 305, 306, 339, 342, 343,

te-protein phosphotransferase are associated with creating 
ligand binding pocket. A similar pattern of concavity result 
was  also  found  for  N-acetylglucosamine  1-carboxyviny-
ltransferase  in  which  a  total  number  of  forty  amino  acid 
residues  were  involved  in  comprising  the  ligand  binding 
pocket of the proteins (23, 24, 27, 50, 91, 94, 95, 115, 116,

Furthermore,  S-SITE  result  represents  the  possible 
ligands  that  can  bind  with  phosphoenolpyruvate-protein 
phosphotransferas as well as N-acetylglucosamine 1-carbo-
xyvinyltransferase and ranked them according to confidence 
score (C-score), C-score ranges from 0 to 1 where a higher 
score implies a more reliable prediction. Among the pre-

dicted  ligands  for  phosphoenolpyruvate-protein  phospho-
transferase, PPR or 3-phosphonopyruvate was exhibited as 
the top ranked ligand having a confidence score (C-score) of 
0.45 and interacting with total eleven residues (301, 303,

also resides within predicted ligand binding pocket of the 
protein. The best predicted ligand for N-acetylglucosamine 
1-carboxyvinyl-transferase  was  SKP  or  5-(1-carboxy-1- 
phosphonooxy-ethoxyl)-shikimate-3-phosphate,  represen-
ting  C-score  0.41  and  interacting  with  total  number  of 
sixteen residues (23, 24, 28, 94, 95, 98, 123, 165, 166, 167, 
308, 330, 334, 373, 374, and 400) that are also common in 
the ligand binding pocket of the protein (Fig. 6).

Discussion

To nullify the 2,643 proteins from total 4,630 redundant 
proteins  of  F.  nucleatum  stain  ATCC  25586  the  CD-HIT 
program  used  at  60%  identity  [35,  36].  After  BLASTP 
analysis, human non-homologous proteins were selected to 
avoid  unwanted  cross-reactions  and  cytotoxicity.  BLASTP 
against DEG identified the essential genes. The genes that 
are vital to maintain cellular life are referred to as essential 
genes.  Essential  gene  products  of  pathogen  can  become 
promising novel drug targets owing to the reason that most 
antibiotics  attack  cellular  processes  in  bacteria  [32,  37]. 
Essential genes which are exclusive to an organism can be 
regarded as species-specific therapeutic targets [33].

Sub-cellular localization of proteins has an important role 
in  drug  targets  prediction  arena.  Proteins  situated  in 
cytoplasmic  membrane  are  considered  more  valuable  for 
target site.

3D structure of protein molecules exposes the molecular 
basis of protein function and thus allows an efficient design 
of  experiments,  for  example,  site-directed  mutagenesis,

disease-related  mutation  analysis,  or  the  structure  based 
design of specific inhibitors [38]. That is why, the deter-
mination of the 3D structure of a protein molecule is central 
to its understanding and manipulation of biochemical and 
cellular functions [39].

In  case  of  each  protein,  greater  than  90%  confidence 
match  was  obtained  except  PTS  system  fructose-specific 
IIABC component protein. A high confidence match indi-
cates that, overall fold of the models were almost accurate 
and the central core of the model was correct as well [34]. 
Ramachandran plot statistics of phosphoenolpyruvate-p-
rotein  phosphotransferase  and  UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 
1-carboxyvinyltransferase showed that most of the amino 
acid residues (above 90% of amino acid residues) were found 
in most favoured regions indicating that the protein models 
were of very good quality.

The program functions based on the analysis of statistics 
of  non-bonded  interactions  between  different  atom  types 
[40].  Verify  3D  graph  and  a  value  of  0.85  of  phosph-
oenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase in contrast to the 
value  0.72  for  N-acetylglucosamine  1-carboxyvinyltran-
sferase  indicates  that  environmental  profile  phosphoen-
olpyruvate-protein  phosphotransferase  is  fairly  good  [41, 
42]. The QMEAN assesses the global quality of the models 
based on a linear combination of six structural descriptions. 
The local geometry model is analyzed by calculating torsion 
angel potential over three consecutive amino acids. The long 
range  interactions  are  assessed  by  estimating  secondary 
structure specific distance dependent pairwise residue level 
potential. A solvation potential reveals the burial state of the 
residues. Simple sequence editor and auto cross covariance 
conformity  indicates  that  the  assessment  between  the 
predicted  and  calculated  secondary  structure  and  solvent 
accessibility is of good quality [43-45]. 

Specifying exact ligand-binding site on protein is a crucial 
step in rational designing of novel therapeutic molecules to 
modulate the protein functions [46]. TM-SITE and S-SITE, 
along  with  considering  COFACTOR,  FINDSITE,  and 
CONCAVITY results which increases Matthews correlation 
coefficient by 15% over the best individual predictions and 
these  predictions  are  considered  reliable  and  accurate  in 
recent times [47].

Moreover, pharmaco-chemical properties of the PPR and 
SKP  that  were  retrieved  from  the  DrugBank  Database 
indicate that these compounds are non-carcinogenic, non-
toxic and moderately absorbable by human intestine (abso-
rption  probability,  0.7197  and  0.5233,  respectively)  [48]. 
Hence,  the  activity  of  the  phosphoenolpyruvate-protein 
phosphotransferase can be inhibited by the PPR, derivatives 
of PPR or PPR related compounds. Likewise, the activity of 
the N-acetylglucosamine 1-carboxyvinyltransferase probably 

can be hindered by SKP, derivatives of SKP or SKP related 
molecules.  Since,  phosphoenolpyruvate-protein  phospho-
transferase  and  N-acetylglucosamine  1-carboxyvinyltrans-
ferase  were  identified  as  the  essential  proteins  for  the 
bacterial  survival,  blocking  the  function  of  these  two 
enzymes can be a novel way to treat F. nucleatum–associated 
diseases.  However,  further  research  should  be  conducted 
both in vivo and in vitro to ascertain this result.

Understanding  the  docking  studies  with  phosphoe-
nolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase, PTS system fructose- 
specific IIABC component, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 
1-carboxyvinyl transferase protein as a receptor and proto-
porphyrin  IX  as  a  ligand.  Analysis  of  the  lowest  docked 
energy value, the involvement of H-bonds, calculated root 
mean square deviation value, and interacting residues was 
considered [49].

The interactions between the amino acid residues in active 
sites and the ligand molecules derived in this study would be 
valuable to understand the potential mechanism of residues 
and the drug binding. It is evident that that protoporphyrin 
IX is involved in similar hydrogen bond interactions with 
proteins  and  thus  the  results  found  in  our  study  are 
significant.  However,  to  consider  these  proteins  as  valid 
target for drug designing, the future researchers also need to 
think  about  the  possibility  that  these  same  functional 
proteins may exist in some other beneficial bacteria from 
human microbiota.

In conclusion, in this era of genomic science, subtractive 
genomic  approach  to  drug  designing  has  been  greatly 
facilitated by the plethora of bacterial genomic information. 
The  demand  for  new  classes  of  antibacterial  drug  is 
increasingly  growing  as  drug  resistance  challenges  the 
effectiveness of existing therapies. Hence, there are obvious 
benefits  for  the  identification  and  evaluation  of  new 
therapeutic  targets  and  which  is  why  this  study  has 
scrutinized  the  proteome  of  oral  pathogen  F.  nucleatum 
adopting the subtractive genomic approach and identified 
two  promising  novel  therapeutic  targets  along  with 
predicting  their  3D  structures,  ligand  binding  sites  and 
corresponding  ligands  as  well.  These  findings  have  now 
paved  the  way  for  design  and  development  of  novel 
inhibitors  for  F.  nucleatum  using  the  structure  based  drug 
design strategy.
