Abstract

An  alternative  way  of  constructing  ancestral  graphs, 
which  is  different  from  the  coalescent-based  approach, 
is  proposed  using  population  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD) 
data.  The  main  difference  from  the  existing  method  is 
the  construction  of  the  ancestral  graphs  based  on  var-
iants  instead  of  individual  sequences.  Therefore,  the  key 
of  the  proposed  method  is  to  use  the  order  of  allele 
ages  in  the  graphs.  Distinct  from  the  previous  age-esti-
mation  methods,  allele  ages  are  estimated  from  full  hap-
lotype  information  by  examining  the  number  of  gen-
erations  from  the  initial  complete  LD  to  the  current  de-
cayed  state  for  each  two  variants  depending  on  the  di-
rection  of  LD  decay  between  variants.  Using  a  simple 
algorithmic  procedure,  an  ancestral  graph  can  be  de-
rived  from  the  expected  allele  ages  and  current  LD  de-
cay  status.  This  method  is  different  in  many  ways  from 
previous  methods,  and,  with  further  improvement,  it 
might  be  a  good  replacement  for  the  current  appro-
aches.

Introduction

The  evolution  of  the  human  genome  is  one  of  the  major 
interests  in  biological  research.  Population  genetics  has 
contributed  a  lot  to  our  understanding  of  the  evolu-
tionary  process  (Crow  and  Kimura,  1970;  Ewens,  2004; 
Hartl  and  Clark,  2007;  Kimura  and  Ohta,  1971;  Lynch 
and  Walsh,  1998;  Weir,  1996),  especially  through  studies 
on  gene  genealogies  using  coalescence  of  individual  se-
quences  (Hudson,  1990;  Rosenberg  and  Nordborg, 
2002).  The  coalescent  approach  is  a  way  of  reconstruct-

ing  ancestral  history,  in  which  mathematical  tractability 
can  provide  easy  incorporation  of  mutation  and  re-
combination  in  the  reconstruction  of  ancestral  histories 
(Nordborg,  2001).  This  method  is  mainly  used  to  infer 
the  population  genetic  parameters  rather  than  infer  the 
actual  ancestral  history  of  the  genome  due  to  its  proba-
bilistic  properties.  Also,  because  of  its  potential  for  cap-
turing  disease  variants  using  population  data, 
the 
fine-mapping  method  using  a  direct  or  indirect  coa-
lescent  approach  has  been  developed  (Larribe  et al., 
2002;  Minichiello  and  Durbin,  2006;  Molitor et al.,  2003a; 
Molitor et al.,  2003b;  Molitor  et al.,  2005;  Rannala  and 
Reeve,  2001;  Rannala  and  Slatkin,  1998;  Reeve  and 
Rannala,  2002;  Zollner  and  Pritchard,  2005;  Zollner  et 
al.,  2005). 
    In  the  inference  of  gene  genealogies  using  coa-
lescence,  the  incorporation  of  recombination  in  the  coa-
lescent  process  seems  simple  in  that  it  only  adds  two 
ancestors  to  the  graph.  However,  the  actual  con-
struction  of  the  ancestral  recombination  graph  is  ex-
tremely  challenging  (McVean  and  Cardin,  2005).  It 
should  be  noted  that 
frequent  past  recombination 
events  over  a  large  sequence  imply  multiple  most  recent 
common  ancestors  (MRCA),  since  recombination  can 
add  more  ancestors 
reduce  ancestors  by 
coalescence.  In  addition  to  the  problems  with  in-
corporating  recombination,  the  coalescent  approach 
deals  with  individual  sequences,  which  are  different  from 
the  genotype  data  that  we  usually  have.  Therefore,  in 
the  coalescent  approach,  the  stochastic  inferences  us-
ing  genotype  data  involve  additional  assumptions  or 
constraints  (Zollner  and  Pritchard,  2005).  This  problem 
continues  when  using  sequenced  data  because  the  po-
sitions  of  mutation  sites  are  given. 
    In  order  to  find  a  possible  future  remedy  for  the  cur-
rent  approaches  and  obtain  more  descriptive  analyses 
from  actual  ancestral  graphs  instead  of  probability  dis-
tributions  of  graphs,  an  alternative  way  of  constructing 
ancestral  graphs  that  avoids  the  multiple  MRCA,  as  well 
as  unnatural  constraints,  is  proposed  in  this  study. 
Instead  of  constructing  the  genealogies  by  coalescence 
of  each  individual  sequence  in  a  backward  direction,  the 
focus  is  on  the  emerging  order  of  variants  in  the  ances-
tral  history  of  genetic  data.  By  concentrating  on  the  var-
iants  themselves  and  constructing  the  graph  in  a  for-
ward  direction,  multiple  MRCAs  are  avoidable,  naturally 

than

representing  only  one  ancestral  haplotype.  The  con-
structed  ancestral  graph  exhibits  only  “observable”  mu-
tations  and  recombinations,  thereby  eliminating  the  un-
naturally  constrained  mutation  and  unobserved  recombi-
nation  events.  The  proposed  method  is  faithful  to  the 
observed  data  in  constructing  the  past  genealogy  by  re-
ducing  parameters  that  are  unknown  and  not  imperative. 
    In  the  proposed  method,  the  estimation  of  allele  age 
is  critical  for  constructing  the  ancestral  graph.  Classically, 
allele  ages  are  estimated  from  intra-allelic  variability  or 
allele  frequency,  considering  population  factors  such  as 
natural  selection,  genetic  drift,  mutation,  and  gene  flow 
(Slatkin  and  Rannala,  2000).  Since  allele  frequencies  can 
be  affected  by  unknown  population  factors,  the  exact 
measure  of  allele  age  is  quite  difficult  to  determine  in 
most  cases.  The  estimation  of  allele  age  from  the  linked 
markers  can  be  distinguished  by  two  major  approaches 
(Rannala  and  Bertorelle,  2001),  i.e.,  a  phylogenetic  ap-
proach  with  a  direct  age  inference  from  the  root  of  the 
constructed  tree  and  the  population  genetic  approach 
that  relies  on  models  of  demography,  mutation,  and 
recombination.  The  phylogenetic  method  does  not  con-
sider  recombination,  but  population  genetic  approaches 
may  consider  both  mutation  and  recombination  pro-
cesses. 
    In  population  genetic  approaches  with  recombination, 
the  basic  concept  of  using  recombination  in  age  estima-
tion  is  the  moment  estimator  of  linkage  disequilibrium 
(LD)  decay  (Slatkin  and  Rannala,  2000).  For  better  esti-
mates  with  multiple-linked  marker  loci,  parametric  stat-
istical  methods  that  incorporate  demographic  parame-
ters  have  been  developed  with  consideration  of  the 
gene  tree  (Rannala  and  Bertorelle,  2001).  There  has 
been  an  improvement  in  estimating  allele  ages  using  the 
approximation  of  coalescent  approaches  considering 
both  allele  frequency  and  LD  (Rannala  and  Reeve,  2003; 
Slatkin,  2008).  Relying  on  stochastic  processes,  these 
approaches  are  designed  mainly  for  estimating  the  age 
of  low-frequency  disease  mutations  in  conjunction  with 
finding  the  locations  of  the  disease  mutations  or  for 
jointly  estimating  low-frequency  allele  age  and  selection 
intensity.  Since  the  focus  of  this  study  is  to  derive  the 
ancestral  graph  from  the  allele  age  of  each  variant,  a 
new  method  for  finding  at  least  the  relative  allele  ages 
of  common  variants  is  necessary.
    To  solve  the  problem  as  simply  as  possible,  the  dem-
ographic  and  population  genetic  parameters  are  consid-
ered  to  be  minimal.  Thus,  the  LD  decay  at  linked  mark-
ers  is  the  only  measurement  in  the  age  estimation  of 
this  study,  which  is  partially  similar  to  the  methods  of 
the  moment  estimator  using  LD  (Slatkin  and  Rannala, 
2000).  In  contrast  with  the  moment  estimator  of  LD,  the 
recursive  expression  for  LD  decay  is  used  for  each  age 

in  consideration  of  the  initial  LD  state,  and  a  useful  al-
gorithmic  procedure  is  developed  for  the  mean  allele 
age.  Using  the  estimated  ages,  the  ancestral  graph  can 
be  derived.  The  basic  idea  for  constructing  the  ancestral 
graph  is  to  add  new  incoming  alleles  to  the  original 
haplotypes  depending  on  the  order  of  allele  age.  In  this 
method,  the  initial  LD  state  between  the  emerging  var-
iant  and  the  existing  variant(s)  is  critical  in  determining 
the  node  of  the  ancestral  graph.  To  test  this  new  meth-
od,  a  coalescent-based  simulation  sample  and  real  data 
are  examined  in  order  to  construct  the  ancestral  graph. 

Methods

Allele  age  estimation

For  two  biallelic  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs), 
there  is  a  maximum  of  four  possible  haplotypes,  and 
they  decay  together  in  a  comprehensive  manner  as  in-
dicated  in  Equation  (1).  When  the  major  alleles  of  each 
variant  are  “1”  and  the  minor  alleles  are  “2,”  the  nota-
tions p1, p2, p3,  and p4  indicate  the  frequencies  of  hap-
lotypes  11,  12,  21,  and  22,  respectively.  If  R  is  the  re-
combination  fraction  between  two  biallelic  loci  (0＜R≤
0.5),  the  haplotype  frequencies  (pi,t)  of  the  current  gen-
eration  are  expressed  as  the  haplotype  frequencies  at 
the  previous  time  t-1  in  the  Wright-Fisher  model  with 
the  assumptions  of  random  mating  and  discrete  non-
overlapping  generations.  The  decay  generation,  counted 
from  Equation  (1),  can  be  used  as  the  estimation  of  the 
relative  allele  age.  This  method  can  be  applicable  to  any 
SNPs,  but  needs  some  corrections  when  applying  to 
other  types  of  polymorphisms  such  as  short  tandem  re-
peats  (STR).

    LD  between  two  variants  decays  after  the  emergence 
of  the  younger  variant,  which  is  indicated  in  Fig.  1  as 
dashed  lines  for  examples.  In  Fig.  1,  11  → 21  involves 
mutation  at  the  first  locus  (from  allele  1  to  2),  and  this 
happened  before  the  mutation  at  the  second  locus.  21
→22  in  (a)  and  11  → 12  in  (b)  involves  mutation  at  the 
second  locus.  Since  it  is  just  an  example  figure,  the 
emergence  times  of  the  younger  variants  are  arbitrary 
for  both  (a)  and  (b)  in  Fig.  1.  LD  decay  occurs  in  only 
one  direction  towards  linkage  equilibrium  (LE)  with  no 
reversal.  The  recombination  between  two  different  hap-
lotypes  generates  an  existing  haplotype  (Fig.  1,  21  in  (a) 
or  11  in  (b))  and  a  new  recombinant  haplotype  (Fig.  1, 
12  in  (a)  or  22  in  (b)).  The  LD  decay  state  depends  on 
the  current  frequencies  of  four  possible  haplotypes,

is  adjusted  for  each  pair  of  variants,  depending  on  the 
distance  between  variants.
    The  age  obtained  from  the  haplotypes  of  two  variants 
is  for  only  one  of  the  variants,  more  precisely,  the 
youngest  allele  among  four  possible  alleles  in  two 
variants.  In  this  method,  the  estimated  age  is  actually 
for  the  allele  with  the  lowest  frequency  due  to  the  as-
sumption  of  fixed  allele  frequencies  and  their  initial 
states,  which  are  derived  from  their  haplotype  frequen-
cies.  Consequently,  variants  with  low  frequencies  have 
more  data.  The  most  frequent  variant  does  not  have  any 
data  remaining,  and  it  is,  consequently,  the  oldest  one. 
If  there  are  a  total  of  k  variants,  there  is  a  maximum  of 
k-1  ages  for  a  variant  (maximum,  k-1  ages,  for  the  low-
est  frequency  variant).  For  a  variant’s  age,  the  mean 
can  be  the  descent  estimate  of  the  variant  age.  To  re-
duce  the  variance,  the  youngest  one  is  removed  from 
further  age  estimation  of  the  other  variants  at  each 
stage.  The  procedures  are  listed  below:
    (1)  Calculate  ages  depending  on  their  initial  LD  state 
from  all  possible  LD  combinations  for  k  variants. 
    (2)  Among  ages  of  k-1  combinations  for  each  variant, 
take  the  age  into  account  only  if  the  minor  allele 
frequency  of  the  target  variant  is  less  than  the 
coupled  variant  and  then  find  the  mean  for  each 
variant.

    (3) Find  the  youngest  variant  from  the  mean  allele 
ages  and  remove  all  the  data  of  other  variants 
generated  with  the  youngest  variant.  Return  to  the 
second  step  and  repeat  until  the  last  variant 
remains.

    As  indicated,  from  the  simple  algorithmic  procedure, 
the  expected  mean  allele  ages  are  assigned  to  each 
variant.  For  calculating  the  LD  decay  generation  from 
the  initial  and  current  states,  C++  was  used  for  fast 
calculation.  The  stopping  point  for  the  age  calculation  is 
when  the  differences  become  lower  than  10
frequencies  at  time  t  and  frequencies  at  complete  LE. 
The  algorithm  for  finding  relative  allele  ages  uses  R.

Constructing  the  ancestral  graph

from 

The  ancestral  graph  can  be  derived  from  the  relative  al-
lele  ages.  This  ancestral  graph  method  is  more  oriented 
to  the  variant’s  origin  than  to  individual  sequences,  dif-
ferent 
the  basic  coalescent  approach  with 
mutation.  In  this  method,  the  original  haplotype,  similar 
to  MRCA,  the  root,  consists  of  the  original  alleles  of 
each  variant.  Basically,  the  role  of  relative  allele  age  in 
constructing  the  ancestral  graph  is  to  order  the  emer-

11→21  involves  mutation  at  the  first  locus  (from  allele  1  to
2),  and  21→22  in  (A)  and  11→12  in  (B)  involves  mutation  at
the  second  locus.  The  time  when  mutation  occurs  is  arbi-
trary  in  this  figure.

which  can  be  expressed  by  the  major  haplotype  fre-
quency  when  the  allele  frequencies  are  fixed.  The  fre-
quency  range  of  the  major  haplotype  is  limited,  depend-
ing  on  the  minor  allele  frequencies  (Park,  2007).  The 
current  major  haplotype  frequency  indicates  one  of  the 
middle  states  between  LE  and  complete  LD.  Since  the 
allele  age  can  be  different  depending  on  the  initial  state 
of  LD  ((a)  or  (b)  in  Fig.  1),  determination  of  that  state  is 
important  for  allele  age  estimation.  As  the  major  hap-
lotype  frequency  approaches  the  minimum,  the  LD  de-
cay  state  changes  from  the  state  (b)  in  Fig.  1  to  the 
complete  LE.  In  the  opposite  case,  the  initial  state  of  LD 
decay  changes  from  the  state  (a)  in  Fig.  1  to  the  com-
plete  LE. 
    The  allele  age  can  be  calculated  by  subtracting  the 
complete  decay  generation  of  the  current  LD  state  from 
the  complete  decay  generation  of  the  initial  state. 
Instead  of  direct  generation  counts  from  the  initial  to 
current  LD  decay  state,  this  method  can  provide  a  more 
accurate  stopping  point  by  avoiding  pass  or  premature 
determination  of  the  current  decay  state.  Without  drift, 
haplotype  frequencies  are  changed  only  in  the  direction 
of  LE  until  reaching  LE.  Using  equation  (1),  the  number 
of  generations  from  the  initial  complete  LD  to  the  cur-
rent  state  can  be  calculated  for  every  two  variants.
    To  reduce  the  usage  of  unknown  parameters,  the  as-
sumptions  include  fixed  allele  frequencies,  fixed  re-
combination  rates,  an  infinite  population  size,  no  re-
current  mutation,  and  no  drift.  Under  these  conditions, 
the  LD  decay  between  polymorphisms  is  dependent 
solely  on  the  allele  age.  This  method  is  basically  similar 
to  the  methods  of  moment  estimator  in  allele  age  esti-
mation  (Slatkin  and  Rannala,  2000),  but  it  is  much  en-
hanced,  based  on  the  LD  information  from  multiple 
linked  variants  and 
the  usage  of  all  observable 
haplotypes.  The  method  serves  as  an  efficient  algo-
rithmic  procedure  in  consideration  of  the  initial  hap-
lotype  states.  In  case  of  LE  in  this  method,  the  allele 
age  is  older  than  the  generation  that  reaches  linkage

gence  of  variants  and  interpret  proper  spacing  between 
nodes  in  the  graph.  The  basic  idea  for  constructing  the 
ancestral  graph  is  to  add  new  mutations  to  the  original 
haplotypes  depending  on  the  order  and  the  initial  state 
between  variants.  The  original  state  between  variants  is 
very  important  in  determining  the  original  haplotype  from 
which  a  new  variant  emerges.  Therefore,  the  ancestral 
graph  is  obtained  from  the  information  of  the  allele  ages 
and  the  initial  LD  state  between  variants. 
    A  case  of  three  variants,  A,  B,  and  C,  is  described 
here  as  an  example.  The  order  from  the  youngest  to  the 
oldest  is  B,  C,  and  A.  The  LD  decay  status  of  each  is 
determined  as  indicated  in  Table  1,  in  which  the  emer-
gence  status  of  mutation  is  indicated  as  (a)  or  (b).  The 
status  (a)  and  (b)  indicate  the  statuses  of  Fig.  1a  and 
Fig.  1b.  Starting  from  the  oldest  variant,  A,  a  mutation 
arises  from  the  original  haplotype  ABC.  At  this  time,  the 
variants  B  or  C  have  not  emerged  yet,  and  all  B  and 
C  variants  are  the  ancestral  states  “B”  and  “C”  instead 
of  the  mutated  ones  “b”  and  “c.”  Next,  the  emergence 
of  “c”  allele  is  from  the  haplotype  “aBC,”  since  the  ini-
tial  LD  decay  status  between  A  and  C  is  (a).  Therefore, 
there  are  three  haplotypes,  ABC,  aBC,  and  aBc  in  this 
generation.  For  the  youngest  “b”  allele,  the  LD  decay 
status  is  (a)  with  A  variant  and  (b)  with  C  variant  as 
shown  in  Table  1,  which  means  that  the  b  allele  arises 
from  the  aBC  haplotype,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2. 
    In  a  more  complicated  situation  involving  recombina-
tion,  the  target  haplotype,  in  which  a  new  mutation 
needs  to  arise,  may  not  exist  in  this  basic  ancestral 
graph.  Recombination  between  proper  haplotypes  can 
generate  the  target  haplotype,  and  the  recombinant 
haplotypes  will  remain  after  that.  The  time  of  recombi-
nation  is  between  the  time  when  the  recombining  hap-
lotypes  are  generated  and  the  time  when  the  new  var-
iant  comes  out.  The  final  ancestral  graph  derived  from 
the  allele  age  and  the  LD  decay  statuses  of  this  exam-
ple  is  indicated  in  Fig.  2.  If  there  are  haplotypes  not 
generated  from  the  ancestral  graph,  proper  recombina-
tion  events  can  be

haplotypes.
    A  summary  of  the  procedure  for  constructing  the  an-
cestral  graph  using  R  is  presented  below:
    (1) Find  the  initial  states  between  variants  and  the  or-

der  of  variants’  ages.

    (2) From  the  existing  node(s),  generate  a  new  node  of 
the  oldest  variant  among  the  remaining  variants, 
considering  the  initial  states  with  the  previously 
emerged  variants.  If  necessary,  generate  a  proper 
node  by  recombination  and  a  new  node  from  the 
newly  generated  proper  node.

    (3) Repeat  step  (2)  until  the  final  node  is  generated.
    (4) Compare  the  generated  haplotypes  to  the  current 
existing  haplotypes  and  incorporate  recombination 
using  most  likely  combinations  of  haplotypes  de-
pending  on  the  haplotype  frequencies  and  the 
number  of  recombination  (i.e.  single  recombination 
is  preferred).  The  timing  of  recombination  events 
is  right  after  the  recombining  haplotypes  are  ge-
nerated.

    This  method  is  rather  descriptive  compared  to  the  co-
alescent  method.  The  most  important  difference  is  that 
the  proposed  method  focuses  on  the  variant  itself,  and 
the  individual  sequences  are  not  considered  in  the  basic 
framework.  The  underlying  assumption  is  that  no  re-
current  mutation  occurs,  implying  that  all  the  same  al-
leles  are  considered  to  be  identical  by  descent  (IBD), 
which  is  reasonable  in  most  cases  considering  esti-
mated  mutation  rates  and  the  theoretical  result  in  pop-
ulation  genetics  (Crow  and  Kimura,  1970;  Nachman  and 
Crowell,  2000).  One  significant  advantage  of  this  method 
is  the  potential  of  the  direct  inference  of  ancestral  muta-
tion  and  recombination  events.  Further  study  would  im-
prove  this  method  by  estimating  the  accurate  timing  of 
recombination  and  the  precise  estimation  of  mean  allele 
ages.

An  Alternative  Ancestral  Graph  Method    5

was  generated  using  a  program,  ms,  that  uses  the 
Wright-Fisher  neutral  model  (Hudson,  2002).  A  total  of 
100  sequences  were  sampled  for  five  segregating  sites. 
The  fraction  of  recombination  based  on  a  finite-sites  re-
combination  model  (Hudson,  1983)  was  set  to  100, 
based  on  the  assumptions  of  a  recombination  proba-
−8  per  base  pair,  a  population  size  of  2.5× 
bility  of  10
106,  and  a  total  of  1,001  base  pairs.  The  relative  posi-
tions  of  variants  were  0.3404,  0.4542,  0.6029,  0.6413, 
and  0.7169  for  each  variant.
    To  test  real  data,  the  genotype  data  from  the 
HapMap  project  were  used  (2003;  2005).  Among  the 
publicly  available  genetic  data,  the  region  of  tumor  pro-
tein  p53  (TP53)  was  selected  considering  the  possibility 
that  the  genes  involved  in  the  fatal  function  of  a  life 
would  have  less  selective  or  deleterious  pressure  on 
their  common  polymorphisms.  Since  allele  age  estima-
tion  method  depends  on  recombination,  the  selected  re-
gion  is  the  region  of  recombination  hotspots  that  have 
consistently  high  recombination  rates,  as  determined  by 
the  HapMap  project  (Fig.  3)  (2005).  Among  the  acces-
sible  population  groups,  only  Han  Chinese  in  Beijing, 
China,  (CHB)  and  Japanese  in  Tokyo,  Japan,  (JPT)  are 
unrelated  individuals.  Since  the  current  study  deals  only 
with  unrelated  individuals,  CHB  and  JPT  were  selected 
for  the  study.  The  CHB  and  JPT  populations,  which 
show  similar  LD  patterns,  were  combined  for  the  analy-
sis  to  obtain  better  estimates.  To  reduce  sampling  error, 
only  minor  allele  frequencies  of  more  than  0.1  were  se-
lected  for  the  analysis,  and  seven  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  the  region  were  finally  selected 
(Table  2).

  From  a  simulation-based  sample  for  a  test,  the  100  se-
quences  harboring  five  variants  were  generated  as  de-
scribed  in  the  sample  description,  and  the  ages  and  the

recombinant  is  indicated  in  (b).

ancestral  states  of  five  variants  were  determined  (Table 
3).  As  described  in  the  methods  section,  only  the  ages 
of  the  variants  that  have  lower  frequencies  than  the 
coupled  variants  through  LD  are  considered  and  are  in-
dicated  in  Table  3.  The  mean  age  is  not  always  the 
mean  of  all  indicated  ages  in  the  Table  since  the  ages 
coupled  with  the  youngest  variants  are  eliminated  for 
the  mean  ages  of  other  variants  after  each  step  to  re-
duce  variance.  In  this  method,  the  complete  LD  always 
results  in  zero  generation  because  allele  ages  depend 
only  on  the  LD.  The  mean  age  of  the  oldest  variant  can-
not  be  found  since  there  are  no  data  left  for  estimating 
its  allele  age.  The  order  of  allele  age  is  obtained  from 
the  mean  allele  ages  of  variants.  From  this  information, 
the  ancestral  graph  for  the  observed  five  variants  is 
drawn  as  shown  in  Fig.  4a,  and  the  ancestral  recombi-
nation  graph  is  drawn  as  shown  in  Fig.  4b.  Starting 
from  the  common  ancestral  haplotype  00000,  the  occur-
rence  of  each  variant  generates  a  new  node.  For  exam-
ining  the  haplotypes  in  the  current  generation,  the  in-
dividual  haplotypes  from  the  sample  sequences  are

summarized  in  Table  4. 
    The  detailed  interpretation  of  the  ancestral  graph  de-
rived  from  this  test  sample  is  described  below  and  in-
cludes  the  putative  recombination  events.  Starting  from 

the  ancestral  graph  without  recombination,  among  the 
current  haplotypes  at  the  final  nodes  in  the  ancestral 
graph,  only  haplotype  01010  disappears  in  the  current 
sequences,  while  the  rest  of  the  haplotypes  remain. 
Haplotype  01010  has  the  same  age  as  variant  2,  which 
has  a  mean  age  of  145378  generations.  However,  the 
haplotype  should  exist  until  the  appearance  of  variant  3, 
the  mean  age  of  which  is  0  generations.  Although  this 
is  a  simulated  sample  with  a  small  sample  size  of  100 
sequences  using  unrealistic  assumptions  due  to  the 
base  model  of  the  simulation,  it  can  be  predicted  that 
haplotype  01010  disappeared  quite  recently  in  the  simu-
lation  data  based  on  the  current  study. 
    Even  though  this  test  is  based  merely  on  simulated 
data,  there  are  four  more  haplotypes  that  were  not  seen 
in  the  ancestral  graph  without  recombination:  10010, 
01000,  00110,  and  00001.  These  are  recombinants  from 
the  existing  haplotypes,  showing  relatively  low  frequen-

cies,  as  indicated  in  Table  4.  Ignoring  double  recombi-
nation  and  focusing  on  the  haplotypes  in  the  graph,  the 
probable  recombination  pairs  are  summarized  in  Table 
5.  Each  recombination  event  happened  in  a  boundary  of 
limiting  generations  depending  on  the  ages  of  the 
haplotypes.  Here,  the  recombination  is  incorporated  into 
the  ancestral  graph  at  the  right  after  the  recombining 
haplotype  is  generated  (Fig.  4b).  Among  the  possible  re-
combination  events  in  Table  5,  the  events  involving  the 
submerged  haplotype  and  the  haplotypes  with  lower  fre-
quencies  are  excluded  for  ARG  as  in  Fig.  4b,  since  the 
other  recombination  events  are  enough  for  generating 
the  target  haplotypes. 

Real  data

For  testing  real  data,  the  genotype  data  of  protein  p53 
(TP53)  from  the  HapMap  project  were  used  (2003; 
2005).  A  detailed  description  of  the  selection  criteria  is 
in  the  methods  section.  From  the  seven  SNPs  selected 
(Table  2),  the  calculated  allele  ages  are  summarized  in 
Table  6.  As  described  in  the  methods  section,  the  most 
frequent  variant,  variant  3,  is  the  oldest.  It  happens  here 
that  the  least  frequent  variant,  variant  6,  is  the  youngest. 
Interestingly,  the  minor  allele  frequency  range  of  all  sev-
en  variants  is  small  in  this  data  set.  The  initial  states  be-
tween  all  variants  are  the  state  “A,”  which  means  the 
new  allele  comes  from  the  haplotype  harboring  the 
younger  allele  (minor  allele  in  this  study)  of  the  existing 
older  variant.  Therefore,  the  ancestral  graph  can  be 
drawn  as  shown  in  Fig.  5,  Table  6  shows  that,  except 
for  the  two  oldest  variants,  all  variants  have  ages  be-

tween  2194  to  17292  generations,  a  relatively  short  in-
terval  compared  with  the  emergence  time  of  45124  gen-
erations  for  the  second-oldest  variant  (variant  2).  This  is 
consistent  with  the  short  range  of  minor  allele  frequen-
cies  among  the  variants. 
    From  the  basic  ancestral  graph  generated  from  the  or-
der  of  the  allele  ages,  there  are  eight  haplotypes 
(number  of  segregating  sites＋1),  as  shown  in  Fig.  5a. 
For  comparison  of  the  haplotypes  in  the  graphs  with  the 
haplotypes  estimated  directly  from  the  genotype  data 
using  existing  methods  (Table  7),  the  two  most  popular 
methods  were  used  to  estimate  haplotypes  and  their 
frequencies.  One  is  the  accelerated  EM  algorithm  similar 
to  the  partition/ligation  method  (Qin et al.,  2002),  which 
is  implemented  in  Haploview  Version  4  (Barrett  et al., 
2005).  Another  is  the  coalescent-based  haplotype  esti-
mation  using  PHASE  Version  2.1.1 
(Stephens  and 
Scheet,  2005;  Stephens  et al.,  2001).  In  Table  7,  the 
probable  original  allele  (major  allele)  is  indicated  as  “0,” 
and  the  changed  allele  is  indicated  as  “1.”  Also,  in  rep-
resenting  haplotypes  with  original  notation,  the  numbers 
“1,  2,  3,  and  4”  indicate  “A,  C,  G,  and  T,”  respectively, 

as  notated  in  Haploview  (Table  7). 
    As  summarized  in  Table  7,  the  haplotypes  and  their 
frequencies  estimated  from  these  two  methods  are 
completely  different,  except  for  a  haplotype  (1110111) 
and  the  two  most  common  haplotypes  (0000000  and 
1111111),  which  are  the  original  haplotype  (0000000) 
and  the  haplotype  that  consists  of  altered  alleles 
(1111111).  Even  the  frequencies  obtained  by  the  two 
methods  for  those  haplotypes  are  very  different.  In 
many  cases,  however,  the  inferred  haplotypes  are  not 
very  different  between  the  methods.  However,  in  this 
case,  minor  alleles  of  all  the  variants  are  linked  together, 
comprising  the  two  most  common  haplotypes,  0000000 
and  1111111,  which  makes  the  inference  of  the  rest  of 
the  haplotypes  more  difficult.  The  rest  of  the  haplotypes 
obtained  using  the  EM  algorithm  show  minor  allele  fre-
quencies  of  less  than  0.05,  but  this  is  not  the  case  us-
ing  the  coalescent  method. 
    Interestingly,  the  method  proposed  in  this  study 
shows  more  similarity  to  the  haplotype  estimates  using 
the  EM  algorithm.  Haplotypes  1111111  and  1111101  are 
seen  in  haplotypes  with  frequencies  higher  than  0.01,  as

in 

two  haplotypes 

estimated  by  EM  (Table  7).  Depending  on  the  con-
structed  ancestral  graph  in  Fig.  5a,  these  haplotypes  are 
generated  most  recently  compared  to  other  haplotypes 
in  Fig.  5a,  thereby  indicating  an  increased  probability  of 
observing 
the  current 
generation.  Appending  these  two  haplotypes,  haplotype 
1111100  is  the  third  recent  haplotype  among  the  eight 
haplotypes  in  Fig.  5a,  and  the  haplotype  also  can  be 
seen  among  haplotypes  with  frequencies  higher  than 
0.01  using  EM  inference  (Table  7).  The  rest  of  the  hap-
lotypes  in  the  EM  estimates  are  expected  to  come  from 
recombination  events.  The  reason  for  differences  with 
the  coalescent-based  method  is  scrutinized  in  the  dis-
cussion  section.
    Similar  to  the  simulation  data,  the  probable  combina-
tion  of  recombination  for  the  top  10  frequent  haplotypes 
as  estimated  by  the  EM  inference  is  represented  in 
Table  8.  Among  the  haplotypes  in  Table  7,  those  not  in-
dicated  in  the  basic  ancestral  graph  (Fig.  5a)  are  only 
considered  as  recombinants,  which  are  the  haplotypes 

with  index  numbers,  3,  5,  6,  7,  and  8  in  Table  7. 
Primarily,  single  recombination  is  considered.  As  in-
dicated  in  Table  8,  the  haplotypes  that  are  not  observed 
in  Fig.  5a  can  now  be  generated  by  each  single  re-
combination  event  from  the  existing  haplotypes  of  the 
basic  ancestral  graph,  Fig.  5a.  Interestingly,  the  third 
most  frequent  haplotype,  0011111,  can  be  generated  by 
recombination  of  either  haplotype  pairs  0000000  and 
1111111,  or  0010000  and  1111111.  In  Table  8,  the  four 
recombination  pairs  include  three  haplotypes  of  each  of 
the  most  common  haplotypes,  0000000  and  1111111, 
which  are  very  likely  to  be  involved  in  recombination 
events  due  to  their  high  frequency.  Taking  the  haplotype 
frequencies  into  account,  the  most  likely  recombination 
events  in  Table  8  are  incorporated  into  the  graph  in  or-
der  (Fig.  5b). 

Discussion

A  novel  methodology  for  constructing  an  ancestral 
graph  is  proposed  in  this  study.  The  proposed  method 
is  based  on  the  variants  themselves  rather  than  in-
dividual  sequences,  so  the  method  produces  results  that 
are  based  on  actual  genetic  data  rather  than  models. 
Although  more  developments  are  necessary,  the  main 
advantages  of  this  method  are  that  (1)  it  is  computation-
ally  favorable,  (2)  it  facilitates  descriptive  interpretation 
of  the  ancestral  graph,  and  (3)  it  provides  the  easier  and 
tangible  incorporation  of  recombination  into  the  graph.  It 
is  noteworthy  that  the  proposed  method  can  provide  a 
descriptive  ancestral  graph  rather  than  a  probability  dis-
tribution  of  all  possible  graphs  as  coalescent-based 
methods  do.  Therefore,  the  current  method  is  designed 

10    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(1)  1-12,  March  2009

mainly  for  obtaining  the  actual  ancestral  graph  rather 
than  inferring  population  genetic  parameters  that  is  the 
main  purpose  in  most  coalescent-based  studies.  At  the 
current  stage,  the  method  of  allele  age  estimation  is  just 
aimed  at  finding  the  relative  allele  ages  of  variants.  For 
accurately  constructing  the  ancestral  graph,  improve-
ments  are  necessary  for  both  the  accurate  allele  age  es-
timation  and  the  accurate  incorporation  of  recombi-
nation. 
    Problems  in  estimating  allele  age  in  this  study  can  be 
mitigated  if  the  effective  population  size  is  fairly  large. 
When  the  effective  population  size  is  large,  the  allele 
frequency  of  a  newly  emerged  mutation  depends  largely 
on  the  number  of  generations  (Crow  and  Kimura,  1970; 
Kimura  and  Ohta,  1971).  Therefore,  it  is  more  likely  that 
the  less  frequent  variant  is  younger  than  the  more  fre-
quent  one.  Another  problem  with  this  method  is  the  as-
sumption  of  fixed  allele  frequencies  during  LD  decay.  In 
the  binomial  random  process,  the  expected  current  al-
lele  frequency  is  the  initial  allele  frequency  due  to  its 
Markovian  property.  However,  in  the  actual  situation,  it 
is  more  likely  that  the  variant  came  from  a  single  muta-
tion  and  increased  its  frequency  through  random  drift. 
Further  advancements  of  allele  age  estimations  can  be 
achieved  by  considering  the  stochastic  process  of  hap-
lotypes  in  a  population.  Since  the  consideration  of  the 
stochastic  process  is  only  for  allele  age  estimation,  the 
descriptive  nature  of  this  ancestral  graph  method  will 
remain.  The  actual  incorporation  of  recombination  in  the 
ancestral  graph  can  also  be  improved  by  further  devel-
opment  of  the  method.
    As  shown  in  the  results  section,  the  haplotypes  from 
the  proposed  method  using  real  data  explain  the  hap-
lotypes  estimated  by  the  EM  algorithm  better  than  the 
coalescent  method.  Differences  from  the  haplotypes  es-
timated  by  the  coalescent-based  method  may  occur 
during 
inference  of  genealogical  histories  by 
coalescence.  As  indicated  previously,  the  underlying  as-
sumptions  of  the  coalescent  theory  can  influence  the  re-
sulting  haplotypes.  Since  the  coalescent  method  is 
based  exclusively  on  population  demographic  history, 
haplotype  inference  might  be  deviated  from  the  actual 
data  while  running  the  haplotype  inference.  Since  the 
EM  method  depends  heavily  on  the  data,  the  estimated 
haplotypes  are  statistically  reasonable  choices  that  can 
be  observed  from  the  given  data.  Therefore,  it  is  en-
couraging  that  the  proposed  method  represents  hap-
lotypes  that  are  more  similar  to  those  based  on  the  EM 
estimates  than  the  estimates  from  the  coalescent-based 
simulation  methods.  The  methodology  in  the  current 
study  does  not  depend  heavily  on  the  population  model 
or  the  parameters.  Therefore,  it  is  more  likely  that  the 
method  in  this  study  might  be  influenced  by  unknown 

the 

population  factors  to  a  lesser  extent  than  the  previous 
coalescent-based  methods. 
    Regarding  the  population  differences  in  the  TP53 
gene  region,  there  are  clear  differences  in  the  LD  pat-
terns  among  different  population  groups.  First,  the  allele 
frequencies  are  strikingly  different.  Some  variants  are 
frequent  only  in  one  population,  and  minor  alleles  of 
several  variants  are  changed  to  major  alleles  in  another 
population.  Second,  the  linkage  disequilibrium  patterns 
are  very  different  among  ethnic  groups.  The  samples 
from  the  Yoruba  in  Ibadan,  Nigeria,  (YRI)  and  from  Utah, 
USA,  (CEU)  show  more  similarity  in  both  allele  fre-
quency  and  LD  pattern  than  the  samples  from  Han 
Chinese  in  Beijing,  China,  (CHB)  and  Japanese  in 
Tokyo,  Japan  (JPT).  It  seems  clear  that  much  more  sim-
ilarities  in  the  polymorphic  pattern  are  shown  within 
Asian  populations  compared  to  other  populations  (Kim 
et al.,  2008;  Lee  et al.,  2008).  The  LD  pattern  of  the 
combined  sample  of  CHB  and  JPT  shows  much  more 
linkage  disequilibrium  between  variants  than  the  other 
two  populations. 
    It  seems  that  the  high  recombination  fraction  in  the 
TP53  gene  region  from  the  HapMap  project  might  come 
from  the  population  effect  of  CEU  and  YRI,  since  the 
estimated  recombination  rates  were  the  averages  for  all 
the  populations  (2005).  Because  only  CHB  and  JPT 
populations  are  used  as  indicated  in  the  methods  sec-
tion,  the  default  recombination  rate,  10
the  methods  section  (Strachan  and  Read,  2000),  was 
used  instead  of  2×10
data  for  the  allele  age  estimation  (Fig.  3).  It  should  be 
noted  that  the  proposed  method  is  very  sensitive  to 
haplotype  frequencies.  Therefore,  considering  the  pop-
ulation  differences  as  mentioned  earlier,  caution  would 
be  necessary  when  interpreting  the  results  from  different 
population  groups. 
    A  novel  ancestral  graph  method  is  proposed  that  fo-
cuses  on  variants  rather  than  individual  sequences.  This 
deterministic  method  is  less  affected  by  past  demo-
graphic  histories  and  population  genetic  parameters 
than  previous  methods,  and  it  presents  a  simpler  way  of 
constructing  ancestral  graphs,  focusing  only  on  the  al-
lele  frequencies  of  variants  and  LD  of  the  genotyped 
variants.  By  excluding  unnecessary  population  genetic 
parameters,  the  method  can  provide  a  more  practical 
interpretation  of  the  human  genome,  as  described 
previously.  More  importantly,  the  proposed  method 
seems  to  represent  both  real  and  simulation  data  quite 
well.  The  results  of  the  real  data  allows  for  a  better  fit 
with  the  haplotypes  estimated  using  the  EM  algorithm 
rather  than  the  coalescent-based  simulated  method.
    The  proposed  method  can  incorporate  the  observed 
ancestral  recombination  event  without  the  concern  of 

−8,  described  in 
−8,  as  indicated  in  the  HapMap 

unobtainable  MRCA.  Due  to  the  potential  for  localizing 
the  disease  variant  based  on  genealogical  history,  the 
coalescent  approach  has  attracted  attention  (Rosenberg 
and  Nordborg,  2002).  However,  as  indicated  previously, 
the  inference  of  the  ancestral  graph  with  recombination 
using  the  coalescent  method  is  computationally  chal-
lenging  (McVean  and  Cardin,  2005).  Although  there  are 
good  approximations  on  coalescence  with  recombina-
tion  for  mapping  disease  variants  (Larribe  et al.,  2002; 
Minichiello  and  Durbin,  2006;  Molitor  et al.,  2003a; 
Molitor  et al.,  2003b;  Molitor et al.,  2005;  Rannala  and 
Reeve,  2001;  Rannala  and  Slatkin,  1998;  Reeve  and 
Rannala,  2002),  a  new  method  is  necessary  to  infer  the 
actual  genealogical  history.  The  proposed  approach  for 
constructing  ancestral  graphs  could  be  a  possible  future 
remedy  for  the  previous  coalescent  approaches  in  terms 
of  computational  efficiency  and  theoretical  settlement  of 
constraints  in  mutation  and  problems  in  incorporating 
recombination  events.
