Mutation  in  HNF1B,  the  hepatocyte  nuclear  factor-1β (HNF-1β)  gene,  results  in  maturity-onset  diabetes  of  the  young 
(MODY) 5, which is characterized by gradual impairment of insulin secretion. However, the functional role of HNF-1β in 
insulin secretion and  glucose metabolism is  not fully  understood.  We  identified  a  family with early-onset  diabetes  that 
fulfilled  the criteria of MODY.  Sanger sequencing  revealed that a heterozygous P159L (CCT  to CTT  in codon  159 in the 
DNA-binding domain) mutation in HNF1B was segregated according to the affected status. To investigate the functional 
consequences of this HNF1B mutation, we generated a P159L HNF1B construct. The wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs 
were transfected into COS-7 cells in the presence of the promoter sequence of human glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2). 
The luciferase reporter assay revealed that P159L HNF1B had decreased transcriptional activity compared to wild-type (p ＜ 
0.05). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed reduced DNA binding activity of P159L HNF1B. In the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell 
line, overexpression of the P159L mutant was significantly associated with decreased mRNA levels of GLUT2 compared to 
wild-type (p ＜ 0.05). However, INS expression was not different between the wild-type and mutant HNF1B constructs. These 
findings suggests that the impaired insulin secretion in this family with the P159L HNF1B mutation may be related to altered 
GLUT2 expression in β-cells rather than decreased insulin gene expression. In conclusion, we have identified a Korean family 
with an HNF1B mutation and characterized its effect on the pathogenesis of diabetes.

Introduction

Maturity-onset  diabetes  of  the  young  (MODY)  is  a 
monogenic form of diabetes characterized by an early onset, 
usually before the age of 25 years; an autosomal dominant 
inheritance; and a defect in pancreatic β-cell function [1]. 
Depending on the specific gene mutation, the synthesis and 
secretion of insulin are altered at different stages. MODY is 
classified  according  to  its  affected  genes,  which  include 

those  encoding  enzymes,  transcription  factors,  and  other 
types of proteins [1, 2]. The transcription factors associated 
with MODY act in the nucleus of β-cells and regulate the 
transcription  of  INS  or  other  genes  encoding  enzymes 
involved in glucose transport and metabolism [1]. 

Hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (HNF-1β) is a homeodo-
main-containing transcription factor that forms a homodimer 
or  heterodimer  with  structurally  related  HNF-1α [3]. 
HNF1B has 9 exons and encodes a 557-amino-acid peptide. 
Its structure is characterized by a highly conserved DNA-

binding  domain  composed  of  an  atypical  POU-specific 
(POUS) and POU-homeo (POUH) domain, but the molecular 
properties of HNF-1β have not been studied much. HNF-1
β is known for playing a role in tissue-specific gene expres-
sion in organs, including the liver, kidney, and pancreatic 
islets [4], and is involved in the β-cell transcription factor 
network  [5].  Heterozygous  mutations  of  HNF1B,  which 
encodes HNF-1β, result in maturity-onset diabetes of the 
young 5 (MODY5), which is characterized by early-onset 
diabetes and various abnormalities, such as renal cysts, renal 
impairment, genital malformation, or hepatobiliary involve-
ment  [6-9].  Patients  with  mutations  in  HNF1B  have 
impaired insulin secretory responses to glucose and insulin 
secretagogues [7, 10, 11] and show progressive loss in basal 
insulin secretion.

Mutation in HNF1B was first described by Horikawa et al. 
in 1997 [12]. Different mutation types, including missense, 
nonsense,  and  frameshift  mutations,  have  been  found  in 
different domains [13-15]. Recently, mutations in exon 2 
and in the DNA-binding domain have been reported [16-20]. 
Barbacci  et  al.  [21] characterized eight naturally occurring 
mutations in different domains. Truncated mutations showed 
defective nuclear localization and weak dominant-negative 
activity, whereas a frameshift mutation within the QSP-rich 
domain  had  partially  reduced  transcriptional  activity. 
Missense  mutations  in  POUS  and  POUH  exhibited  severe 
decreases  in  transcription.  A  certain  mutation  showed  a 
gain-of-function phenotype [22, 23]. In vitro studies suggested 
that clinical phenotypes may be related to loss of function 
and/or dominant-negative mechanisms [8, 24].

In this study, we have identified a family with MODY5 
harboring  a  heterozygous  P159L  HNF1B  mutation.  We 
evaluated  the  functional  consequences  of  this  HNF1B 
mutation on glucose metabolism. 

Methods
Sequencing of HNF1B

The  HNF1B  of  the  patient  was  sequenced  by  Sanger 
method in peripheral blood DNA. Her father, mother, and 
younger brother were also screened by the same method. 
Written informed consent for the genetic study was obtained 
from the patient and her family members before sequencing.

Wild-type and mutant plasmid constructs

Human  wild-type  HNF1B,  cloned  in  pCMV6b,  was 
provided by Dr. J. Takeda, Gifu University, Japan. A point 
mutation was generated by PCR-based site-directed muta-
genesis using the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, 
La  Jolla,  CA,  USA).  The  promoter  of  human  glucose 
transporter type 2 (GLUT2) (−1296 to ＋312), cloned in the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

pGL3-Basic  vector  (Promega,  Madison,  WI,  USA),  was 
provided by Dr. M.S. Lee, Sungkyunkwan University, Korea. 
The  sequences  of  all  genes  for  the  experiment  were 
confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing.

Cell culture

COS-7  cells  were  maintained  in  Dulbecco’s  modified 
Eagle’s  medium  (DMEM)  with  10%  fetal  bovine  serum 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 100 
U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin, before 
transient transfection. MIN6 cells were cultured in RPMI 
1640 with 11.1 mM D-glucose supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (Invitrogen) and the same antibiotics as for 
COS-7. Cells were cultured at 37oC in 5% CO2：95% air.

Transient transfection

COS-7 cells were subcultured in 12-well plates the day 
before transfection; 0.2 μg of pGL3-GLUT2 promoter, 0.02 
μg of HNF1B expression plasmids, and 0.05 μg of pCMV-β
-galactosidase were combined with LipofectAMINE PLUS 
agent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
The cells, in 400 μL of serum-free DMEM, were treated with 
the complex for 3 h, and the medium was changed to DMEM 
with 10% fetal bovine serum. MIN6 cells were subcultured 
in 6-well plates the day before transfection. As it is difficult 
to transfect genes into MIN6 cells, the transfection efficiency 
was evaluated with the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) 
first. After the efficiency was confirmed, 0.5 μg of expres-
sion vector for HNF1B per well was administered. Serum- 
containing medium was added up to the normal volume after 
3 h of incubation and replaced with fresh complete RPMI 
1640 after 8 h. MIN6 cells were harvested for RNA extrac-
tion and protein quantitation after 30 h after the start of 
transfection.

Luciferase reporter assays

Twenty-four  hours  after  the  start  of  transfection,  Cos7 
cells were lysed with reporter lysis buffer and harvested, and 
the  transcriptional  activity  was  measured  using  the 
Luciferase  assay  system  (Promega)  and  Lumet  LB9507 
(Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. To normalize transfection efficiency, 
β-galactosidase activity was measured. Ten microliters of 
cell lysate was mixed with 3 μL of 100 × MgCl2 (0.1 M 
MgCl2  and  4.5  M  β-mercaptoethanol) and  66  μL  1  × o- 
nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside. The activity of β-galactosidase 
was measured by VersaMax spectrophotometry at 420 nm 
(Molecular devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).

following sequences were used for human GLUT2 promoter 
probes: 5'-AAG ACC TCA GTA AAG ATT AAC CAT CAT 
TA-3'; 1 μg of up and down sequences of single-stranded 
oligomer were hybridized within PE buffer (20 mM Tris, 10 
mM MgCl2, 50 nM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT]) by 
incubating  them  at  72oC  for  10  min  and  then  at  room 
temperature for 15 min. The probe was labeled with [α-32P] 
dATP by Klenow DNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX, 
USA), and the labeled probe (25,000 cpm) was incubated 
with nuclear extracts of COS-7 cells that were transfected 
with  pcDNA,  wild-type  HNF1B,  and  H153N  and  P159L 
HNF1B in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 
MO, USA) containing 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM 
DTT, 0.1 mg/mL poly(dIdC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% 
glycerol at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were 
separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and detected by auto-
radiography.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR

Mutant  or  wild-type  HNF1B  was  overexpressed  in  the 
mouse pancreatic β-cell line MIN6. Total RNA was isolated 
using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  To  prepare  cDNA,  6  μL  of  reaction  buffer 
(Invitrogen), 3 μL of 100 mM DTT, 1.5 μL of 10 mM dNTP, 
0.6 μL of random primer, 0.3 μL of RNase inhibitor, 1.0 μL 
of RTase, and 1  μg of RNA were mixed, and RNase-free 
water was added up to 30 μL. The mixture was incubated 
37oC  for  1  h  and  72oC  for  10  min  using  a  PCR  system. 
Expression levels of genes were determined by using SYBR 
Master Mix (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and an AB 7500 Real-time 
PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 
The primer sequences for the PCR were as follows: 5'-GGC 
TAA TTT CAG GAC TGG TT-3' and 5'-TTT CTT TGC CCT 
GAC TTC CT-3' for GLUT2 and 5'-CTC GGC TCA CCG TTT 
CCT T-3' and 5'-CGC GCT TGC TAA TAG TGC AG-3' for 
INS. Samples were prepared repetitively, and each sample 
was analyzed in duplicate. Expression levels of each gene 
were  measured  relative  to  18S  and  normalized  to  the 
expression levels in total RNA with the ΔΔCT method.

Western blot analysis

Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 7.4, 5 mM Na4P2O7, 100 nM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1% 
NP-40, and protease inhibitor (1 μg/μL of aprotinin, 1 μg/
μL of leupeptin, and 1 mM of PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich). After 
determination of protein concentrations, equal amounts of 
cell  lysates  were  separated  by  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate 
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were 
transferred  onto  a  nitrocellulose  membrane  (Whatman, 
Dassel,  Germany).  The  membrane  was  blocked  with  5% 
skim milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at 

room  temperature  and  incubated  with  rabbit  polyclonal 
anti-HNF-1β antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech, San Diego, CA, 
USA) at 4oC. After 8 h, the membranes were probed with 
secondary antibody, and bands were visualized by enhanced 
chemi-luminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).

Statistical analysis

Data were expressed as mean ± standard error (SE). The 
non-parametric t-test and one-way  ANOVA were used to 
compare  the  mean  values  between  the  groups  with 
GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La 
Jolla,  CA,  USA).  p  ＜ 0.05  was  considered  statistically 
significant. All  individual experiments were performed  at 
least in duplicate and were repeated five times on separate 
occasions.

Results

A  27-year-old  woman  with  inadequately  controlled 
diabetes mellitus was admitted for glycemic control. She was 
diagnosed as having diabetes mellitus at an age of 14 (fasting 
plasma glucose 137 mg/dL, postprandial 2-h glucose 239 
mg/dL), with normal  body mass  index (21.9 kg/m2) and 
24-h urine C-peptide level (83.3 μg/day; reference range, 50 
to 100μg/day). Although autoantibodies for pancreatic β-cell 
were not detected, she required insulin therapy for glycemic 
control.  Her  serum  C-peptide  level  decreased  from  1.8 
ng/mL to 0.9 ng/mL during the past year. The total daily 
insulin requirement was 0.68 IU/kg. The patient’s father 
(diagnosed in his early 30s) and grandmother (the age of 
diagnosis was unknown) also had diabetes. She did not have 
urogenital anomalies.

Sequencing  of  HNF1B  revealed  a  heterozygous  P159L 
point mutation (CCT to CTT in codon 159) in the patient. 
Among  the  three  other  family  members,  her  father  was 
found  to  have  the  identical  mutation.  The  pedigree  of 
diabetes mellitus and the result of Sanger sequencing are 
shown in Fig. 1. This nonsynonymous variant co-segregated 
according to the affected state of diabetes within the family. 
Two point mutations, P159L and H153N (for comparison 
as  functionally  proven  mutations;  i.e.,  positive  control), 
were generated by in vitro mutagenesis (Fig. 2). Western blot 
analysis confirmed that the mutant protein was apparently 
expressed  in  the  transfected  COS-7  cells  (Fig.  3A).  The 
region,  including  nucleotide  −1030  of  human  GLUT2 
promoter, which is known to be the cis-element for HNF-1β 
binding [24], was inserted into the luciferase vector (Fig. 
3B). Luciferase activity of the human GLUT2 promoter was 
increased  with  overexpression  of  wild-type  HNF-1β 
compared to the control (p ＜ 0.05 vs. control) (Fig. 3C).

The mRNA levels of GLUT2 and INS in MIN6 cells after 
HNF1B transfection were also investigated. The transfection 
into MIN6 was confirmed with an efficiency of 60% to 65% 
(Fig.  5A).  Western blot  analysis  showed  that  the  protein 
expression was well preserved after transfection (Fig. 5B). 
The quantitated mRNA levels were normalized to that of 
18S. When the wild-type HNF-1β was overexpressed, the 
relative mRNA level of GLUT2 was increased by 2.3-fold (p 
＜ 0.05 vs. control) (Fig. 5C). Compared to the wild-type 
HNF-1β, the relative mRNA levels of GLUT2 for the H153N 
and P159L mutants were significantly decreased (p ＜ 0.05 
vs.  wild-type,  respectively).  There  was  no  significant 
difference in the mRNA expression level of INS among the 
four groups (Fig. 5D).

was observed (p ＜ 0.05 vs. wild-type, respectively). In the 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the proteins of 
the  expected  sizes  were  translated  (Fig.  4A).  The  EMSA 
showed that wild-type HNF-1β protein bound well to the 
GLUT2  promoter,  but  the  mutant  proteins  had  decreased 
binding activity (Fig. 4B).

nonsynonymous mutation in the HNF1B gene. The patient 
was suspected to have MODY, especially MODY5, because of 
the lack of response to sulfonylureas, early (within 3 years) 
requirement of exogenous insulin, and features of insulin 
resistance [25]. Although the patient did not have specific 
clinical features of HNF1B mutation, such as cystic kidney 
disease [6], she had fulfilled the clinical diagnostic criteria of 
MODY.  The  clinical  features  of  MODY5  vary  as  either 
diabetes or urinary tract malformation, or both could be the 
presenting symptoms [14, 20, 26]. According to a systematic 
review  performed  by  Chen  et  al.  [27],  renal  structural 
anomalies are relatively less frequent in missense mutations 
than  in  other  types  of  mutation.  On  the  contrary,  the 
percentage of diabetes mellitus and the frequency of insulin 
treatment tended to be higher.

The mutation of P159L was heterozygous c.476C＞T in 
exon  2  of  HNF1B,  which  is  in  the  DNA-binding  domain. 
Chen et al. [27] found that mutations in HNF1B were more 
likely to be located in the DNA-binding domain, and the 
hotspots were in exons 2 and 4. Yamagata [28] reviewed that 
N228K  is  a  relatively  common  polymorphism  in  Pima 
Indians, and the A241T, G492S, and S465R mutations might 

be rare polymorphisms. In HNF1B-deficient mouse embryos, 
a  dorsal  bud  of  the  pancreas  is  formed  transiently  and 
becomes  absent,  whereas  the  ventral  bud  is  not  affected 
[29]. In two 8-week human fetuses with HNF1B mutations, 
severe pancreas hypoplasia was observed [30]. With these 
consistent findings, the abnormality in the morphogenesis 
of the pancreas is thought to be one of the causes of diabetes 
in MODY5 patients. 

Another  suggested  molecular  mechanism  is  related  to 
altered GLUT2 expression. Wild-type HNF-1β is known to 
bind to the cis-element of GLUT2 and efficiently increase its 
transcription [24]. In this study, overexpression of wild-type 
HNF-1β resulted in an increase in transcriptional activity of 
the GLUT2 promoter, whereas overexpression of the P159L 
mutant resulted in decreased GLUT2 expression. Previous 
studies showed similar results in various types of cells, such 
as  COS-7,  MIN6,  and  HepG2  [20,  24].  GLUT2  is  a  low- 
affinity,  high-capacity  transporter  expressed  mainly  in 
hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule cells, and pancreatic β
-cells [31, 32]. GLUT2 plays a role in β-cell insulin secretion, 
as it senses external glucose and transports it into pancreatic 
β-cells [33]. In vivo studies showed that GLUT2-deficient 

244

www.genominfo.org

mice  were  hyperglycemic,  resulting  in  diabetes  with 
impaired glucose sensing by pancreatic  β-cells [34], and 
GLUT2  was  undetectable  on  β-cells  of  the  two  HNF1B 
mutant fetuses [29]. So, decreased expression of GLUT2 in 
β-cells,  combined  with  a  gradual  reduction  in  insulin 
secretion, could be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes 
mellitus in MODY5 patients. In addition, GLUT2 may also 
affect  β-cell  differentiation  in  the  development  of  the 
pancreas [34, 35].

EMSA was done to examine whether the reduced tran-
scription  activity  was  due  to  the  decreased  DNA-binding 
capacity.  Both  mutant  HNF-1β  proteins  had  decreased 
DNA-binding  activity  compared  to  the  wild-type.  It  was 
previously reported that the H153N HNF-1β mutation had 
diminished DNA-binding  activity [20].  Since both  P159L 
and H153N mutants have intact dimerization domains, it is 
possible that they could dimerize with wild-type HNF-1β 
[9]. However, the mutant/wild-type dimer seems to have a 
defect in DNA binding and limited ability to increase the 
transcription of GLUT2. The mRNA expression of GLUT2 
was  increased  with  wild-type  HNF-1β but  significantly 
suppressed,  almost  to  the  level  observed  in  the  empty 
control vector, in both mutants. The findings of the real-time 
PCR analysis of GLUT2 were consistent with the reporter 
gene assay and DNA binding assay. 

On  the  other  hand,  there  has  been  limited  knowledge 
regarding the mRNA expression of INS with mutant HNF-1β. 
The  mRNA  levels  of  INS  were  not  statistically  different 
between the wild-type- and mutant-expressing MIN6 cells. 
In one study with HNF-1α, neither the wild-type nor the 
mutant activated GLUT2 or the insulin promoter in MIN6 
cells [36]. The authors concluded that endogenous HNF-1α, 
GLUT2, and insulin proteins in MIN6 cells could interfere in 
the transfected reporter assay. The mRNA expression of INS 
is  also  considered  to  be  regulated  by  other  transcription 
factors, and it might have been compensated for by complex 
mechanisms against the mutation of HNF1B. Overall, the 
impaired  insulin  secretion  in  MODY5  patients  might  be 
explained  by  pancreatic  hypoplasia  or  β-cell  dysgenesis 
rather  than  decreased  mRNA  expression  of  INS.  As 
described  above,  decreased  mRNA  expression  of  GLUT2 
might also result in the inhibition of insulin secretion.

This  study  has  some  limitations.  First,  we  could  not 
sequence HNF1B of the patient’s grandmother, who was also 
a patient with diabetes. If she had the same P159L mutation 
of HNF1B, it would have revealed an autosomal dominant 
inheritance  more  clearly.  Second,  alterations  in  insulin 
secretion with the mutation in the pancreatic  β-cell line 
were not evaluated. Further studies of functional changes in 
the P159L mutation are needed.

In conclusion, we have identified a P159L mutation of 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

HNF1B in a family with MODY5 and have characterized the 
functional consequences of this nonsynonymous mutation 
in  the  pathogenesis  of  diabetes.  This  mutation  revealed 
decreased  DNA-binding  activity  and  decreased  transcrip-
tional activity of GLUT2. The mRNA expression of GLUT2 in 
pancreatic β-cell lines was also significantly decreased with 
this mutation, whereas that of INS was not altered. Impaired 
insulin secretion in the patient with the P159L mutation in 
HNF1B might be associated with the alteration of GLUT2- 
related signaling pathways.
