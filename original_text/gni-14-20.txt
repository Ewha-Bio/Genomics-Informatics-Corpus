Internet  addiction  (IA)  has  become  a  widespread  and  problematic  phenomenon  as  smart  devices  pervade  society. 
Moreover,  internet  gaming  disorder  leads  to  increases  in  social  expenditures  for  both  individuals  and  nations  alike. 
Although  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  IA  are  getting  more  important,  the  diagnosis  of  IA  remains  problematic. 
Understanding  the  neurobiological  mechanism  of  behavioral  addictions  is  essential  for  the  development  of  specific 
and  effective  treatments.  Although  there  are  many  databases  related  to  other  addictions,  a  database  for  IA  has  not 
been  developed  yet.  In  addition,  bioinformatics  databases,  especially  genetic  databases,  require  a  high  level  of 
security  and  should  be  designed  based  on  medical  information  standards.  In  this  respect,  our  study  proposes  the 
OAuth  standard  protocol  for  database  access  authorization.  The  proposed  IA  Bioinformatics  (IABio)  database  system 
is  based  on  internet  user  authentication,  which  is  a  guideline  for  medical  information  standards,  and  uses  OAuth  2.0 
for  access  control  technology.  This  study  designed  and  developed  the  system  requirements  and  configuration.  The 
OAuth  2.0  protocol  is  expected  to  establish  the  security  of  personal  medical  information  and  be  applied  to  genomic 
research on IA.

Introduction

Information technology has developed so rapidly all over 
the world that smart devices have become popularized and 
digital  contents  have  been  diversified.  As  a  consequence, 
internet  addiction  (IA)  has  become  an  important  issue. 
Although  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  IA  are  more 
important  than  ever  due  to  pervasive  digital  media  and 
although  measures  to  establish  a  systematic  research 
environment  and  overcome  addiction  problems  are  more 
necessary  than  ever,  unfortunately,  these  steps  not 
progressing fast enough.

It has been known that IA leads to diverse psychosomatic 
problems, such as nonaggressive or oppositional behavior 
and hostility. In Korea, it was reported that 7% of internet 
users aged 5 to 54 years are at risk of IA, and the percentage 

keeps growing [1]. IA disorder, which has many similarities 
to  psychopathological  disorders,  is  on  the  rise  and  is 
considered  a  potential  problem.  Therefore,  a  diagnostic 
standard  is  required  considering  DNA,  protein,  and  the 
characteristics of the structure of the brain.

Many studies have been conducted on genomes that affect 
addictions to substances, such as alcohol, and a considerable 
number  of  databases  have  been  built  up.  However,  a 
biological database of genes, proteins, and brain structures, 
which can be used directly for IA, is not sufficient.

To  build  a  genome  database  related  to  IA,  personal 
genome  data,  which  are  sensitive  to  handle,  have  to  be 
examined, so security should be guaranteed. In addition, a 
medical  information  standard-based  environment  is  very 
important  in  terms  of  security.  It  requires  a  medical 
information standard and access control technology for the

service environment of genomic database [2, 3].

Integration  in  the  Healthcare  Enterprise  (IHE)  [4]  is 
providing  various  types  of  standard  guidelines  to  control 
access to medical information. IHE access control guidelines 
include cross-domain user authentication (XUA), enterprise 
user authentication (EUA) and internet user authentication 
(IUA) [5].

IUA provides the guidelines for access to OAuth 2.0-based 
medical  information  service.  OAuth  2.0  [6]  is  an  access 
control  method  that  manages  several  services  in  a  group 
with one integrated ID. It is used by Google and Facebook. 
Therefore, it provides easy scalability into medical systems 
and easy control of authority for access [7].

In this paper, we propose the medical standard-based IA 
Bioinformatics (IABio) database platform service, which can 
integrate the data on genes, proteins, and brain structure 
image data in internet and game addiction into one database. 
IABio  follows  medical  standard-based  guidelines  and 
controls  access  to  database  using  OAuth  2.0.  Therefore, 
using IABio can provide a medical standard-based service 
environment  and  will  allow  various  integrated  research 
studies  with  an  access  control  method  that  enables 
interchange with other clinical data. 

The  present  study  is  composed  as  follows.  Relevant 
studies and literature on this topic are described in section II. 
In section III, IABio is designed. In section IV, the designed 
IABio  is  explained.  Our  study  closes  with  conclusions  in 
section V.

Addiction genome database

A genome database has many merits, such as predicting 
the occurrence of disease and thus preventing and swiftly 
diagnosing it, which leads to early treatment; determining 
the  prognosis  accurately  by  selecting  the  treatment  of  a 
certain gene; and evaluating the effectiveness of treatment. 
It  has  been  difficult  to  verify  the  connection  between 
addiction and genes in the past, but some attempts have 
been made to identify the DNA responsible for addiction in 
the  last  decade.  The  findings  say  that  when  a  genetic 
mutation occurs in a certain region of dopamine receptor in 
a human brain, dopamine receptor fails to function properly 
and thus can have superficial behavioral inclinations, such as 
addiction to smoking, alcohol, or drugs [8].

According to those studies, when genetic mutation occurs 
in a certain region of dopamine receptor in a human brain, 
dopamine receptor fails to function properly, and when the 
mutated genes make contact with a substance, they secrete 
acetylcholine,  which  stimulates  pleasure,  which  leads  to 
addiction. The genes known to be related to addiction are 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

DRD2  Tag  1A,  DRD2  Tag  1B,  and  so  on.  A  German 
psychobiologic research team examined and compared 132 
internet addicts and 711 normal people to find the cause of 
addiction and found that most of the addicts had a mutated 
gene called CHRNA4NA4 [9]. 

It is necessary that a database be built for addiction and 
that  a  service  provision  environment  be  established  for 
studies regarding IA. Therefore, an integrated database is 
required to support genome research and analysis.

IUA/OAuth 2.0

Genes, proteins, and neuroimages require tight security, 
because  they  are  very  sensitive  information  in  terms  of 
personal  information  privacy.  To  use  such  information, 
medical standards should be complied and proper guidelines 
should be used. Our study uses the IUA method by IHE, 
which provides medical standard guidelines [4, 5].

IUA  is  an  IHE  profile  based  on  access  control  with 
token-based authentication and provides access authority to 
medical  information  services  and  guidelines  for  user 
authentication. The IUA guideline is seen in Fig. 1. 

It  can  grant  only  necessary  authorities  to  other  users 
according  to  database  policy  and  can  also  provide  other 
services  in  a  single  server,  which  means  that  it  has  an 
excellent  scalability.  In  addition,  when  authorization  is 
obtained  from  one  authorization  server,  it  allows  the 
authority to use the information related to a certain user. For 
an authorization client to use the resource, it is necessary to 
obtain an authorization token from the authorization server. 
Authorization  token  holders  need  to  check  the  terms  of 
validity before using it. In case the term expires, they need to 
get new authorization tokens. A database environment is 
suitable for using other data, such as genes, proteins, and 
brain images, and can protect patients’ data systematically. 
In this study, IUA is used to build a database applied with a 
medical information standard and OAuth 2.0 to be applied to 
standard IUA guidelines.

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol with authorization function to

control  and  manage  access  to  web  services.  The  HTTP 
RESTful method is used to perform access control using an 
authorization token and to ask an authorization server for 
resources  [10].  HTTP  RESTful  is  a  method  to  request 
services through a URL. Because it uses data messages in the 
form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), which is small in 
size, it is mainly used for mobile services at present [11]. 
OAuth 2.0 uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to give and 
take  authorization  tokens  and  messages.  There  are  four 
authorization methods. Because the authorization method 
differs by scenario, load in a server should be considered. It 
should support scalability for a large service. In addition, the 
service  provider  and  authorization  server  are  completely 
separate; so, server multiplexing and authorization server 
multiplexing are possible.

There are four authorization methods: authorization code 
grant (ACG), implicit grant (IG), resource owner password 
credentials  grant  (ROPCG),  and  client  credential  grant 
(CCG). ACG and IG are re-direction methods and should 
interact with resource owners and receive requests. ROPCG 
is  an  authorization  method  in  which  a  client  receives  a 
resource  owner’s  authorization  information  directly  and 
relays  it  to  the  authorization  server.  CCG  can  provide 
requests only with an authorization token.

Complicated methods, such as ACG and IG, are not needed 
in a database environment for analysis, because the level of 
trust between users and providers is high. In addition, CCG 
can  not  be  used,  because  resources  have  to  be  used. 
Therefore, ROPCG is the most appropriate method for IABio.

IABio 

The IABio platform service can be applied with medical 
information security guidelines; can provide a portal service; 
and can collect and analyze databases related to IA. To design 
the proposed service model, our study explains the analysis 
of requirements, the structure of the platform service, the 
contents of the service, and the user authorization method.

Analysis of requirements

It is necessary to analyze the complicated requirements of 
the system to design and develop the IABio platform service. 
Because security is very important to a medical information 
system, it requires user identification. In addition, the data 
exchange method, integrated data composition, and services 
should be specified. 

User identification
It is needed to analyze patients’ genomic data concerning 
IA for treatment and prevention and to provide them with 
customized  service.  To  do  so,  an  integrated  data  analysis 

system  is  required  and  should  work  with  all  genomic 
information. Users with access to IABio are classified into 
gene  researcher,  protein  researcher,  brain  imaging  re-
searcher, senior researcher for integrated work, and server 
manager. Each manager has access to a patient’s genome 
information  according  to  the  Medical  Care  Act,  but  the 
researcher is limited to only ‘concerned’ information and can 
not have access to other information. However, all of the 
researchers  can  have  access  to  the  risk  outcome  that  is 
yielded  from  the  integrated  analysis  of  all  genomic 
information.  The  integrated  analysis  risk  results  do  not 
include individual patient information but are considered 
new information and thus are not against the Medical Care 
Act. Therefore, each researcher can search, enter data, and 
modify  genomic  data  he  manages  and  can  search  out 
integrated analysis outcomes. 

Standard-based biological data exchange
To subdivide access from each researcher, access control is 
needed or else the server manager can not even read the 
genomic data. Therefore, a server manager can only control 
information that the genome manager has access to. To do 
so,  the  authorization  server  and  IABio  server  have  to  be 
separated  physically.  Medical  information  standard-based 
guidelines and access control are necessary for authorization 
and approval.

Integrated biological data platform
Biological data (gene, protein, and brain structure image) 
have different identifier values. However, if several pieces of 
genomic data for one patient have more than one identifier, 
it  is  against  data  integrity,  because  information  for  one 
patient  is  duplicated.  In  addition,  because  genome  in-
formation  entered  by  each  data  manager  is  created  in 
different systems, an identification system is needed. 

Web portal service
Access to an integrated database requires an accessible 
service and web portal service in which the authorization 
and  approval  procedure  has  been  established,  which  is 
necessary to search data related to a genome. Therefore, it is 
necessary to provide an integrated service using a security 
system suitable for medical standards. Accordingly, a web 
portal is designed using OAuth 2.0.

Provision of data analysis output
IA  risk  factors  should  be  provided  through  integrated 
analysis based on data entered by each researcher and user. 
Integrated  information  should  be  provided  for  single 
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNP)  and  protein  markers 
related  to  IA.  Also,  the  accuracy  of  risk  factors  should 

22

advance  enough  to  utilize  a  diagnostic  index.  After  risk 
factors that are highly relevant to IA are determined through 
the integrated analysis of several areas in the genome, a risk 
evaluation score for the respective factor should be provided.
To compose such a sophisticated system, our study uses 
medical  standard  guidelines  in  designing  the  genome 
database platform.

IABio service architecture

Aiming to provide a genome database platform for IA, our 
study  designs  the  IABio  platform  service  structure  in 
consideration of medical standard security and requirements 
as shown in Fig. 2.

By relevance to the genome, the users are divided into 
gene  researcher,  protein  researcher,  brain  imaging  re-
searcher, and senior researcher. Each user can operate and 
monitor accessible data by his/her authority. In addition, the 
users can connect to it through a smart device or web service.
For users to have access to IABio, they should be issued 
authorization  tokens  from  the  authorization  server.  The 
authorization token functions to identify researchers using 
genome information and is physically separated from the 
IABio platform. When using such an authorization token, it 
is possible to access IABio. When an authorization token is 
not valid or when a user is not registered, the token should 
be issued or re-issued by the authorization server. Our study 
complies with IUA medical standard guidelines for access, 
uses OAuth 2.0, and composes the security system.

IABio is accessible through a web portal. Genome data 
entered by each researcher are entered in a database in an 
agreeable format to master patient index (MPI) structure. 
Because  gene,  protein,  and  brain  imaging  data  are  all  in 
different data formats, a method is necessary to integrate 
them.  Therefore,  MPI  is  used.  It  allows  scalability  in 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

connection with different clinical data. MPI configures the 
data format in a way to identify them, develops them into a 
hash-type algorithm, creates an identification system, and 
maintains  data  integrity.  In  an  MPI-based  identification 
system, each manager does not know the password structure. 
Therefore, researchers can not have access to different data. 
The  security  system  of  the  proposed  IABio  platform  has 
pre-defined password keys with the authorization server and 
performs the authorization and approval procedure by the 
user. The contents of MPI are not described here, because 
they are not part of the aim of this study.

Three  analyses  are  performed  to  provide  services  from 
IABio. The first is proteomics analysis. Proteomics is a study 
concerned  with  the  structure  and  analysis  of  proteins 
occurring in living organisms. It aims to analyze proteins on 
a great scale; write a map of functional interrelations; and 
demonstrate a certain protein and the gene that creates it 
through structural analysis. The second analysis is IA risk 
factor analysis. SNPs and protein markers related to IA yield 
risk factors for IA. In addition, it analyzes clinical data, such 
as survey, patient interview, functional magnetic resonance 
imaging, and brain imaging, in addition to a genome/protein 
index,  in  integrated  manner,  finally  creating  a  diagnostic 
index. The third analysis is risk evaluation analysis. When 
risk  factors  highly  relevant  to  IA  are  determined  by 
integrated analysis of genome data, it generates an algorithm 
to provide a risk evaluation score for the respective factor. In 
this  study,  the  contents  of  genome  analyses  are  not 
described, because they are separate areas of study. 

Because IABio service model proposed in our study can 
ensure safe access to information entered by users and can 
provide integrated data analysis service. It can be applied to 
several platforms as well as studies related to IA.

Four actors consist of a researcher, database, web portal, 
and  authorization  server.  A  researcher  accesses  the 
authorization system to have access to the IABio platform 
and  requests  an  access  token.  The  authorization  server 
confirms the legitimacy of the access by the user and issues 
the  right  access  token  for  his/her  authority.  Then,  the 
researcher acquires the access token.

through a portal. The web portal and database identify the 
access token. When the login is done properly, the user can 
input  and  output  data.  Data  can  be  entered  according  to 
information related to a concerned genome. Genome input 
data are analyzed, and the analyzed information is saved. 

The  researcher  requests  data  output  to  monitor  the 
analysis  results  and  related  data.  Token  authorization 
contents  are  analyzed  for  a  second  time  to  check  if  the 
researcher  is  legitimate  for  data  confirmation  before  the 
analysis results and entered information are retrieved.

OAuth 2.0-based authorization model

The  researcher  proceeds  to  access  the  IABio  platform 

In this study, the IUA guideline [5] and OAuth 2.0 [6] are 

24

www.genominfo.org

used to design and realize IABio. Researchers should obtain 
access authorization to use IABio and the concerned data. 
The server manager who controls the authorization server 
should  not  have  access  to  the  database  in  which  patient 
information is saved. Therefore, the IABio server should be 
physically  separated  from  the  authorization  server  and 
provide  only  authorization  and  authority.  This  kind  of 
environment is suitable for the IUA guideline. In this study, 
the authorization method uses the OAuth 2.0-based ROPCG 
method and is designed in a communication diagram, as in 
Fig. 4.

Our study proposes an authorization method based on the 
2-step access authorization of IABio, along with resource 
owner server (web portal) authorization. Each researcher 
(client) should be assigned an authorization token from the 
authorization  server  to  get  access  to  the  portal.  After 
obtaining the authorization token, the researcher has access 
to the portal and proceeds with the first authorization. Next, 
the researcher gets the second authorization in IABio to use 
the  service.  Because  security  authorization  is  strictly 
designed  in  double  walls,  it  can  avoid  weaknesses  to 
phishing scams and impersonation attacks. 

The first step of the authorization procedure is to check if 
it is possible to identify users’ personal information. The 
second authorization step proceeds with authorization for 
database access one more time. 

Our study uses this 2-step authorization in designing and 

developing IABio.

IABio database
System environment

Fig. 5 shows the system environment in which the IABio 
system  is  composed  with  OAuth  2.0  of  a  medical  in-
formation standard environment.

The system environment has the structure of a hardware 
and development environment. Two servers are used: IABio 
server and authorization server. HP ProLiant Micro Server 
Gen8 is used to design the IABio database, and it consists of 
1TB  SSD,  2TB  HDD,  and  12GB  RAM.  To  compose  the 
development  environment,  Apache  2.2  is  used  as  server 
software to configure the Tomcat Server. For the web service, 
PHP  5.2  is  used  to  supplement  the  functions  of  existing 
HTTP language. MySQL 5.1 is used to compose the Tomcat 
server and PHP, which can interwork with the database. APM 
(Apache,  PHP,  MySQL)  is  mutually  complementary  and 
flexible for interworking. Furthermore, it is compatible with 
all operating systems, such as Unix, Linux, and Windows.

The  authorization  server  uses  Naver  application  pro-
gramming interface (API), which supports OAuth 2.0 [12]. 
Since  Naver  API  provides  a  security  server  in  itself,  it  is 
cost-effective. In addition, it is possible to customize so as to 
receive an authorization token by using Naver ID. Currently, 
most domestic web service providers related to authoriza-
tion use OAuth 2.0 of Naver API. Therefore, it can ensure 
security.  JSON  method  is  employed  for  the  exchange  of 
messages  between  a  portal  and  database  server  and 
authorization  server.  The  JSON  method  enables  message 
exchange with shorter codes than the existing Extensible 
Markup Language (XML) method. Therefore, it is faster in

tics (IABio) system environment. MPI,

speed and can reduce load.

For security protocol, IUA guidelines and OAuth 2.0 are 
used.  PHP  2.2  is  used  to  realize  OAuth  2.0.  The  JSON 
method can transmit authorization tokens and protect users’ 
personal information.

The  database  module  is  structured  to  have  access  to 
genome data. The authorization token method should be 
used to have access to a database module. The Advanced 
Encryption  Standard  (AES)  256  algorithm  is  used  to 
enhance the level of security. AES 256 is a symmetric key 
algorithm that supports block passwords. AES 256 is the 
most reliable symmetric key algorithm among any developed 
thus far. Its method uses key values used between a user and 
service.  A  user  can  access  the  web  portal  and  database 
without concerned keys. PHP 2.2 is used for the module to 

have access to and operate IABio. In addition, MPI is used to 
ensure the integrity of the genome database. It can support 
interworking between data. Therefore, data integration is 
possible. Furthermore, because MPI uses Hash 256, each 
user  can  confirm  which  data  are  interworked.  The 
Bio-Marker database is composed so as to receive the entry of 
gene data, protein data, and brain imaging data.

Security evaluation 

OAuth 2.0 has a weakness for vulnerable replay attacks. In 
this study, a replay attack can solve problems by using the 
2-step  access  authorization.  Replay  attack  and  defense 
scenarios are shown in Fig. 6.

An attacker is disguised as a client to obtain an EC1 key 
(with access token) when passed during the communication

between the authorization server and client. The attacker, 
disguised as a client, attempts to perform a replay attack 
obtained using the access token. In this case, the attacker has 
access  to  the  web  portal  using  the  EC1  key  (with  access 
token) shared with the authentication server. However, the 
EC2 key is needed to access IABio database. An attacker who 
does not have the EC2 key can not access the data, because 
the attacker can not analyze contents in the access token of 
EC2. Thus, an attacker can not access the IABio database, 
because the attacker does not have the EC2 key. EC1 and EC2 
can be obtained only from the pre-consultation process.

Implementation screen

The IABio platform uses the authorization server provided 
in Naver API [12]. Therefore, it can acquire an authorization 
token in Naver and can have access to the portal by using it. To 
access the authorization server, only a pre-authorized Naver 
ID can be used. Therefore, a token can be issued or re-issued 
only when having client information. The left side of Fig. 7 
shows the page to access the web portal, and the right side is 
the page to receive authorization tokens through Naver.

As seen in Fig. 8, login is done to the authorization server 
with client information. Then, it is possible to have access to 
the web portal of IABio. The right side of Fig. 8 shows the

Conclusion

IA is a kind of illness in which the occurrence increases 
along with the development of IT technology. Although it is 
urgent to have an analysis database of IA, it is not sufficient 
now.  Because  the  database  needed  to  analyze  medical 
information handles very sensitive personal data, security is 
very  important.  Our  study  proposed  the  IABio  platform 
service  using  OAuth  in  a  medical  information  standard- 
based  environment.  The  proposed  IABio  uses  IUA  as  a 
medical  standard  guideline  and  complies  with  medical 
information standards. Also, it uses OAuth 2.0, which is an 
access control technology. To realize IABio, it is necessary to 
analyze  the  complicated  requirements  of  a  medical  in-
formation  system  and  to  design  the  system  from  the 
perspective of security. In addition, our study developed a 
prototype IABio system and tested if it could be applied with 
a security system. As a result, it was found that each user had 
a different environment in which the researcher needed to 
access a database. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed 
IABio can be actively used for studies of IA.

As follow-up research, solutions to phishing scams and 
re-use  attack,  to  which  OAuth  2.0  is  vulnerable,  will  be 
examined. Also, an index searching method will be studied 
to quickly search genome information related to IA.
