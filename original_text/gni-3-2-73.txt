Abstract 
The  comparative  analysis  of  the  human  and  primate 
genomes  including  the  chimpanzee  can  reveal  unique 
types of information impossible to obtain from comparing 
the  human  genome  with 
the  genomes  of  other 
vertebrates. PrimateDB is an open depository server that 
provides primate genome information for the comparative 
genome  research.  The  database  also  provides  an  easy 
access to variable information within/between the primate 
genomes  and  supports  analyzed  information,  such  as 
annotation  and  retroelements  and  phylogeny.  The 
comparative analyses of more primate genomes are also 
being included as the long-term objective.

Introduction 
After  the  completion  of  the  human  genome  project, 
primate genomes including a common chimpanzee are 
focused  for  understanding  the  origin  of  humanity  and 
human genetic diseases. These genome data are being 
produced  rapidly  and  massively.  However,  information 
of  primate  genome  are  scattered  throughout  several 
databases. 

There are many families of retroelements in  primate 
genomes.  As  the  most  successful  short  interspersed 
elements  (SINEs)  in  primate  genomes,  Atu  elements 
have  had  remarkable  proliferation  during  the  primate

radiation  and  have expanded to more than  one  million 
repetitive  elements  dispersed  throughout  the  human 
genome  (Batzer  and  Deininger,  2002).  Among  Atu 
repeat  subfamily,  AtuY  elements  might  be  contributed 
the  driving  force  for  speciation  between  human  and 
chimpanzee  from  the  common  ancestor  (Sakaki  et at., 
2003; Watanabe et at.,  2004) 

We  constructed  a  database,  PrimateDB 

that 
integrates  primate  genomic  data and  provides  several 
analyzed data on whole-genome scale by bioinformatics 
methods.  In addition the user can easily search variable 
information  about  the  genomes  of  primate  including 
genome sequence, annotation information, retroelement 
information by using the database. 

Methods 
Primate genome sequence database 
The primate genome database was implemented using 
the  Select  Query  Language  (SOL)  from  the  MySQL 
database  server.  Whole  genome  sequence  data  of 
primate  mainly 
from  common  chimpanzee  were 
downloaded  from  Trace  archive  of  NCBI  (http://www. 
ncbi.nih.gov/Traces/trace.cgi)  and  local  alignment  with 
human  chromosomes  was  done by  using  BLAT (Kent, 
2002).  The  database  relies  on  the  build  30  of  NCBI 
human  genome  and  will  be  updated  with  each  new 
release.  The  pre-dataset  of  each  chromosome  group 
was  assembled  by  using  ARACHNE  (Batzoglou  eta/., 
2002; Jaffe et at., 2003). For analysis of large scale data 
from  the  Trace  archive  an  analytical  pipeline  was 
designed by Perl  language. 

The resulting contigs was annotated by using BLAT to 
UCSC Human reference sequence (hg17). The assembled 
sequences  written  by  Perl  script  were  added  as  a 
customer track to UCSC genome browser and resulting 
data were stored in the MySQL database server (Fig.  1 ). 

Phylogenetic information 
For the comparison of disease related genes located in 
human chromosomes with those of primate orthologous 
chromosomes,  complete  exon  sequences  of  disease 
related  genes  annotated  at  OMIM  (Online  Mendelian 
Inheritance  in  Man)  dataset  of  NCBI  (http://www.ncbi.nih. 
gov/ entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM) were used for executing

Primate retroelement database 
Human,  chimpanzee,  gorilla,  and  orangutan  genome 
sequences  were  retrieved  from  the  UCSC  Genome 
Browser  by  using  human  RefSeq.  The  human  and 

chimpanzee  genome  sequences  were  annotated  by 
using both CENSOR (Version 4.X; http://www.girinst.org) 
and RepeatMasker (Smit and Green, unpublished work; 
http://repeatmasker.genome.washingthon.edu). The 
resulting data were stored to MySQL database. Analysis 
of  repeat  elements  was  executed  by dividing  genome 
region into UTR, exon and intron, respectively. The outcome 
of queries can be sequence alignment, genomic locus in

Results and Discussion 
Analytic  pipeline  for  comparative  approach  of  primate 
genome information mainly from the NCBI Trace archive 
of chimpanzee genome was designed and constructed. 
Through  the  analysis  system  other  primate  genomes 
were  included  and  analyzed.  As  human  genome  as  a 
reference chimpanzee genome was also compared for 
the  comparative  analysis  of  retroelement  from  which 
functional  repeat  can  be  analyzed.  Based  upon  the 
present  databases  evolutionary analysis  of  genome  of 
primates including retroelements to  understand human 
uniqueness should be stimulated.

Description of the PrimateDB interface 
The  HTML  interface  for  PrimteDB  (Fig.  3)  is  made  by 
using  PERL and  PHP.  There  are  five  web  pages:  The 
main  page,  contig  search, 
retroelement  search, 
reference,  and  analysis  tools.  The  PrimateDB  web 
interface allows access of data through  graphical or list 
browsing, searching by keywords,  names or sequences 
of repeat family and class.  The schematic physical map 
presents 
locations  of  genes  and 
retroelements  in  the  area  defined  by  the  user  query. 
Alignment of the nucleotide sequences queried by user 
can be retrieved.
