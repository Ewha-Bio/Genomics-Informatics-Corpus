Abstract 
Germ-line  mutations  of  the  BRCA 1  gene  confer  an 
increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA 1 in 
female cells  is  directly related  with the  maintenance of 
the inactive X chromosome (Xi). The effect by the loss of 
the BRCA 1 function on the X chromosome gene expression 
remains  unclear  in  cancer  cells.  We  attempted  to 
investigate the expression pattern of the X-linked genes 
by performing BRCA 1 knockdown via RNA interference 
in the MCF 7 breast cancer cell  line. The transcriptional 
and translational levels of BRCA 1 were decreased over 
95% in  the  MCF 7 cells after BRCA 1 knockdown.  The 
expression  patterns  of  one  hundred  ninety  X-linked 
genes  were  profiled  by  the  X  chromosome-specific 
eDNA arrays.  A  total  of seven  percent  of the  X-linked 
genes (14/190) were aberrantly expressed by over 2-fold 
in the MCF7-BRCA1  knockdown cells, which contained 
two  up-regulated  genes  (2/190,  1 %)  and  12  down(cid:173)
regulated  genes  (12/190,  6.3%).  It  is  interesting  that 
72% of the aberrantly expressed  X-linked  genes were 
located on the Xq (1 0/14,) region. Our data suggests that 
BRCA 1 may not be important to maintain X chromosome 
inactivation  in  cancer because the  BRCA 1 knockdown 
did increase the expression of the only one percent of 
X-linked genes in the human breast cancer cells.

factors are involved in conjunction with the observed the 
BRCA 1  germline  mutations  in  familial  breast  cancer. 
Women with a mutation in one allele of the BRCA 1 gene 
have  higher rates of breast,  ovarian and other cancers 
(Easton et at., 1993). The hereditary breast cancers have 
a different gene expression pattern than do the sporadic 
cancers (Hedenfalk et at.,  2003). 

BRCA1  has  multiple  functions  for  DNA  repair, 
maintenance of genomic integrity, transcription regulation 
and cancer- suppression (Venkitaraman 2002).  BRCA 1 
mutation  can  regulate  the  expression  of  the  various 
genes  such  as  oestrogen-receptor,  ERBB2,  p53  and 
cyclin D1  in familial cancer (Narod eta/., 2004). However, 
BRCA 1  mediated  transcriptional  regulation  is  not  well 
understood. The overexpression of BRCA 1 induced the 
genes  related  with  the  DNA  damage-response,  the 
apoptotic  pathway,  the  estrogen-response  and  the 
cytokine signal transduction pathway (Welcsh eta/., 2002). 
The  expression  pattern  of  the  downstream  genes 
according to the loss of BRCA 1 is not clear. BRCA 1 may 
change the other gene expressions by direct or indirect 
protein interactions with RNA polymerase II,  helicase A 
and etc. (Rosen eta/., 2003). 

the 

BRCA1  in  female  cells  is  directly  related  with  the 
maintenance  of 
inactive  X  chromosome  (Xi) 
(Ganesan  eta/.,  2004).  BRCA1  may be  related  to  the 
expression  of  the  X  chromosome  genes.  Xi-specific 
transcript  (XIST)  is  located  within  the  X-inactivation 
center (XIC)  in  the female  somatic cells,  and  it plays a 
crucial role in Xi. Silencing of Xi is initiated at one location 
on the XIC.  The coating  of XIST on  Xi  is supported  by 
BRCA 1  because  BRCA 1  defect  cancers  show  the  Xi 
chromatin structural defects (Ganesan et al., 2002). The 
role of BRCA 1 as related with the XIST location in breast 
cancer  suggests  that  the  BRCA 1  is  a  key  point  to 
maintain the Xi  in breast cancer (Sirchia eta/., 2005). 

To  study  the  differential  expression  pattern  of 
X-linked  genes  in  BRCA 1-associated  breast  cancers, 
we attempted to investigate the change of expression of 
the 190 X-linked genes by inducing BRCA 1 knockdown 
in  a human breast cancer cell  line having the wild type 
BRCA 1, MCF7 by performing an X chromosome specific 
eDNA microarray. Microarray technology has been used 
for  the  analysis  of  genome-wide  gene  expression 
profiles, and it is a powerful tool for analyzing the variety 
genes expression of samples. 

Materials and Methods 
BRCA1 RNA interference (RNAi) expression vector 
The  mammalian  expression  vector,  pSuper.retro.puro. 
(Oiigoengine, Seattle, WA) was used for examining the 
expression  of  RNAi  in  MCF7  cells.  The  construct  was 
generated  by  annealing  the  following  complementary 
oligonucleotides.  The  synthesized  oligonucleotides 
were forward, 5' -G ATC CCC GAA AGT ACG AGA TTT 
AGT C TT CAA GAG AGA CTAAAT CTC GTA CTT TCT 
TTT TGG  AAA-3·,  and  reverse,  5'-AG  CTT TTC CAA 
AAA GAAAGT ACG AGA TTT AGT CTC TCT TGA AGA 
CTA AAT CTC  GTA CTT TCG  GG-3',  and  they were 
inserted into the pSUPER vector at the Bgl II and Hind III 
sites (Fabbro et at.,  2004) 

Cell culture and transfection 

Human breast cancer MCF7 cells were obtained from 
American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells 
were grown in  RPMI-1640 medium  (Gibco BRL,  Cergy 
Pontoise, France), and this was supplemented with 10% 
fetal  bovine serum,  1% penicillin and  1% streptomycin. 
The  cells  were  seeded  onto  60  cm2  dishes  and  then 
transfected at 70-80% confluence with  8 ug  of plasmid 
DNA by using  Lipofectamin  2000  reagent according to 
the  manufacture's  instructions  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad, 
CA,  U.S.A).  The  cells  were  analyzed  at  72  h  post(cid:173)
transfection with performing puromycin selection. 

to 

Total  RNA  isolation  and  quantitative  real-time 
RT-PCR 
The total  RNA was isolated from the cultured cells with 
using  QIAGEN  RNA-Mini  kits  according 
the 
manufacture's  instructions  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA).  All 
the RNA preparations were treated with DNase I (Roche, 
Boehringer-Mannhein, Germany). For the RNA analysis, 
equivalent amounts of total RNA served as the template 
for  eDNA  synthesis  with  using  reverse-transcriptase 
(Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  U.S.A).  Real-time  RT-PCR 
assays were carried out in a fluorometric thermal cycler 
(Rotor-Gene  2000,  Corbett  Research,  Australia).  For 
performing the quantitative real-time RT-PCR, SYBR-Green 
(Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA)  was  added  to  the  reaction 
mixture,  and the fluorescence  was  measured  after each 
cycle. After the native eDNA copy number of each gene 
was calculated with using the comparative MCT method 
for each sample, the relative ratios of the tested gene for 
GAPDH were generated. The date is shown as the mean 
and standard deviation values of the three measurements 
per data point. 

BRCA 1 Knockdown in MCF7  155 

Western blotting 
Whole-cell  extracts were prepared from the cell  lysates 
in  a buffer that contained 50 mM  Tris-HCI  pH  8.0,  150 
mM NaCI,  1% NP-40,  1 mM PMSF, 5 mM EDTA and 4 
mg/ml of protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma, MO,  USA). 
The samples were separated on 8% SDS polyacrylamide 
gels  and  then  blotted  onto  PVDF  membranes.  The 
primary antibodies used were anti-BRCA 1 (C-20, Santa 
Cruz  Biotechnology,  1 :200)  and  anti-,6-actin  (AC-15, 
Sigma,  1 :5,000).  After  incubation  with  horseradish 
peroxidase-coupled  secondary  antibodies  (anti-rabbit, 
Upstate, 1:1000 or anti-mouse, Calbiochem, 1 :1000), the 
signals were detected by performing chemiluminescence 
with  using  ECL  (Amersharm,  Pharmacia,  Piscataway, 
NJ). 

X chromosome-specific eDNA microarrays 
One-hundred  ninety  X-linked  clones  were  provided  by 
KRIBB  (Korea  Research 
Institute  Bioscience  and 
Biotechnology),  and  the  clone  information  is  listed  in 
Table 1. Those clones were spotted in aX-linked eDNA 
microarray  from  Digital  Genomics  (Digital  Genomics, 
Seoul,  Korea).  The  RNA  was  prepared  by  using 
RiboAmp  RNA  amplification  kits  according  to  the 
manufacture's  instruction  (Arcturus,  Carlsbad,  CA). 
Each  3  11g  of aRNA (antisense  RNA)  was labeled with 
either Cy3-UTP or Cy5-UTP (NEN Life Science Products, 
Boston,  MA,  U.S.A.)  during  the  reverse  transcription 
(RT) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A). After hybridization, 
the  slide  was  dried  by  centrifugation,  and  then  it  was 
scanned on a ScanArray 4000XL (Packard Bioscience, 
Billerica, MA,  U.S.A.). The unified image was quantified 
with  using  lmaGene™ version  4.0  (BioDiscovery,  Inc., 
Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A.). Data analysis were performed 
using  the  GeneSight™  3.10  (BioDiscovery,  Inc.,  Los 
Angeles,  CA,  U.S.A.).

Results 
BRCA 1 knockdown by the RNAi method 
We  used  RNAi  for  examining  the  gene  expression 
change  according  to  BRCA 1  knockdown  in  the  MCF7 
cells.  The  RNAi  was  produced  by  employing  the 
pSuper.retro.puro-vector system, which was indicated in 
the material and methods section (Fabbro eta/., 2004). 
Successful use of this technology depends on effective 
mRNA degradation and the protein turnover.  Bae  et a/ 
reported the  knockdown  of BRCA 1 by  using  the  RNAi 
method in  MCF7 cells  (Bae  et at.,  2004).  We used the

We assessed the silencing effect BRCA 1-RNAi on its 
target  mRNA  by  RT-PCR  and  Western  blotting. 
Real-time RT-PCR data (Fig.  1a.) showed that BRCA1 
mRNA level was markedly downregulated in MCF7 cells 
transfected  with  BRCA 1-RNAi  for  72  h.  The  Y  axis 
indicates the expression level of BRCA 1 mRNA that was 
normalized  by using GAPDH.  The data are presented 
as  the  mean ± SE  of  the  individual  values  from  three 
separate  experiments.  The  knockdown  level  of  the 
BRCA1  protein  was  also  confirmed  by  western  blot 
analysis (Fig.  1b).  BRCA1  protein was not detected at

X-linked  gene  expression  pattems  by  eDNA 
microarray 
We  performed  the  eDNA  microarray  to  identify  the 
expression  pattern  of the  X-linked  genes  according  to 
BRCA 1  knockdown.  Our  X-linked  eDNA  microarray 
contained  190  X-linked  genes;  the  lists  of  genes  are 
shown in Table 1. The total RNA was extracted from both 
BRCA 1-RNAi  and  mock-transfected  MCF7  cells.  The 
probe was generated via RT-PCR from the BRCA 1-RNAi 
samples and the mock-transfected samples, respectively. 
We  first  compared  the  X-linked  gene  expression  by 
performing  BRCA1  knockdown.  To  verify  the  different 
incorporation  rates  of  the  Cy-3  and  Cy-5  dye,  we 
swapped the fluorescent  dye  (Fig.  2a).  The  schematic 
diagram for the change of the expression  levels of the 
X-linked  genes  was  according  to  the  X  chromosomal 

physical map (Fig. 2b). The overall differentially expressed 
genes between the BRCA 1-RNAi and the mock-transfected 
MCF7 cells were described according to the X chromosome 
loci (Fig. 2b). TheY axis represents the expression level 
(log2 ratio> 1, log2 ratio>-1) in the BRCA 1-RNAi transfected 
MCF7  cells.  Similar  results  were  shown  by  the  three 
repeated  experiments.  A  total  of  seven  percent of the 
190 X-linked genes (14/190) were differentially expressed, 
and 28% were at Xp and 72% were at Xq.  Two genes 
(2/190,  1 %), RBM1 0 and VBP1, were up-regulated, and 
12 genes (12/190, 6.3%),  UBE1, OFD1, GYG2,  NONO, 
TAF9L,  TSPAN6,  MCTS1,  MTMR1,  FAM3A,  GDI1, 
CXorf40  and  SLC1 OA4,  were  down-regulated  by  over 
2-fold in the BRCA 1-RNAi transfected MCF7 cells.

in  the different  gene expression  profiles  (Rosen  eta/.,

genes  is  incompletely  understood  in  BRCA 1-related 
breast cancer. This study is the first data concerning the 
expression  pattern  of the  X-linked  genes after BRCA 1 
knockdown with using RNAi by performing DNA microarray 
experiments.  After 
the  BRCA 1  knockdown,  we 
experimented with  the eDNA microarray to identify the 
expression pattern of the X-linked genes. 

A  new  function  for  BRCA 1  was  reported  in  the 
heterochromatin formation,  especially in  the  inactive X 
chromosome (Ganesan eta/., 2002). However, it remains 
unclear  whether  BRCA 1  modulates  the  expression  of 
the  X-linked  genes  to  a  global  (affecting  the  entire  X 
chromosome)  or  specific  degree.  Welcsh  et  a/.  have 
reported the  upregulation of the XIST RNA levels,  and 
this was followed by the BRCA 1 expression (Welcsh  et 
a/., 2002).  However, we found that the XIST expression 
was  not  changed  by  BRCA1  knockdown  (data  not 
shown), even though the XIST expression was low in the 
MCF7 cells. Sudbral eta/. employed X chromosome-specific 
eDNA arrays to identify the genes that escaped from the 
X-inactivation (Sudbrak eta/., 2001 ). We also employed 
X chromosome-specific eDNA arrays that spotted 190 X 
chromosome genes to identify the differentially expressed 
X-linked  genes  according  to  the  BRCA 1  knockdown 
(Jeong  eta/.,  2004).  However,  almost  all  the  X-linked 
genes were  not changed by BRCA 1 knockdown  in the 
MCF7 cells. 

Our  data  is  the  first  to  report  the  X-linked  gene 
expression according to BRCA 1 knockdown. We suggest 
that BRCA 1 may not involve the X-linked gene expression, 
at least the MCF7 cancer cells.  We supposed that both 
the  X  chromosomes  of  the  MCF7  human  breast 
carcinoma cell line may have active (Sirchia eta/., 2005). 
Further investigations are needed to determine whether 
BRCA 1 is related to Xi through such epigenetic mechanisms 
as chromatin modification.
