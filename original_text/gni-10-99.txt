Dyslipidemia, mainly characterized by high triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, is an 
important  etiological  factor  in  the  development  of  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD).  Considering  the  relationship  between 
childhood obesity and CVD risk, it would be worthwhile to evaluate whether previously identified lipid-related variants in 
adult subjects are associated with lipid variations in a childhood obesity study (n = 482). In an association analysis for 16 
genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS)-based  candidate  loci,  we  confirmed  significant  associations  of  a  genetic 
predisposition  to  lipoprotein  concentrations  in  a  childhood  obesity  study.  Having  two  loci  (rs10503669  at  LPL  and 
rs16940212 at LIPC) that showed the strongest association with blood levels of TG and HDL-C, we calculated a genetic risk 
score (GRS), representing the sum of the risk alleles. It has been observed that increasing GRS is significantly associated with 

decreased HDL-C (effect size, －1.13 ± 0.07) compared to single nucleotide polymorphism combinations without two risk 

variants. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between allelic dosage score and risk allele (rs10503669 at LPL) on 
high TG levels (effect size, 10.89 ± 0.84). These two loci yielded consistent associations in our previous meta-analysis. Taken 
together, our findings demonstrate that the genetic architecture of circulating lipid levels (TG and HDL-C) overlap to a large 
extent in childhood as well as in adulthood. Post-GWAS functional characterization of these variants is further required to 
elucidate their pathophysiological roles and biological mechanisms.

Introduction

Dyslipidemia  is  an  important  etiological  factor  in  the 
development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the 
leading cause of deaths for adults. Dyslipidemia is mainly 
characterized  by  elevated  levels  of  triglycerides  (TGs), 
increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and 
reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [1].
In the past few years, genome-wide association studies 
(GWASs)  and  meta-analyses  have  identified  common 
genetic variants that contribute to blood lipid phenotypes in 
Caucasian-based  populations  [2-8].  In  addition,  we  have 
convincingly  mapped  16  loci  for  major  lipoprotein  con-

centrations  (TG,  HDL-C,  and  LDL-C)  in  a  two-stage 
association study in individuals of East Asian ancestry [9].
Given  the  growing  global  epidemic  of  metabolic  syn-
drome,  including  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes  (T2D), 
lipoprotein metabolism disorders have become an important 
health problem in adulthood but also have emerged as an 
increasingly  prevalent  risk  factor  in  childhood  [10]. 
Although many GWASs and meta-analyses have provided 
susceptibility  genes  or  loci  for  lipid-related  traits  from 
multiple large population-based cohorts of adults, it is of 
great  importance  to evaluate  genetic predisposition at  an 
early age. However, little is known about their genetic effects 
in a younger population. Moreover, most identified variants

have shown modest effects and have explained only a small 
proportion of heritable components for disease risk [11]. 
Nevertheless, when multiple genetic markers are considered 
together, literature-based genetic risk scores might be useful 
in improving the identification of the genetic contribution in 
those at high risk of disease [12-14]. Therefore, the aim of 
this  study  was  to  consolidate  the  associations  of  GWAS- 
based candidate variants with blood lipid concentrations in a 
childhood obesity study and to evaluate genetic risk scores 
(GRS) for lipid-related risk phenotypes.

Methods
Study subjects

 Korean  Association  Resource  (KARE)  study  was  col-
lected  through  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiologic  Study 
project - in total, 10,038 people, 40-69 years old, living in 
Ansung and Ansan, from 2001-2002. For more information, 
the  study  has  already  been  reported  [9,  15].  The  Health 
Examinee cohort (HEXA) shared project is a community- 
based epidemiological cohort of 1,200,000 subjects (aged, 
40-69) who were recruited for baseline examination from 
2004 to 2009. To share the controls, 4,302 subjects were 
randomly selected to participate between 2006 and 2007. 
The  BioBank  Japan  study  was  approved  by  the  ethical 
committees  in  the  Institute  of  Medical  Science,  the 
University of Tokyo, and the Center for Genomic Medicine, 
RIKEN. Subjects for the Health2 cohorts for the replication 
study were selected from another community-based cohort 
sample  provided  by  the  Health2  study,  as  described  pre-
viously [15]. We examined 7,861 selected from the 8,500 
participants (aged, 40-69). The students aged 9 and 12 years 
were recruited from Gwacheon City and Gyeonggi Province 
between April and June 2010. This study was conducted as 
part  of  the  Korean  Children-Adolescents  Study  (KoCAS), 
which  has  been  monitored  yearly  since  their  entry  into 
elementary school at age 7 in Gwacheon City or fourth grade 
at age 10 in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, Korea. Subjects 
who were enrolled in a specific diet program or were taking 
any  medications  known  to  affect  appetite  were  excluded 
from  the  study.  The  study  protocol  was  approved  by  the 
institutional  review  board  of  Seoul-Paik  Hospital,  Inje 
University, and the Korea Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the 
children’s parents.

Genotyping

 KARE  samples  were  genotyped  using  Affymetrix 
Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  (Affymetrix,  Santa 
Clara, CA, USA) and processed by Bayesian Robust Linear 
Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) geno-

typing  algorithm  [16].  The  HEXA  shared  sample  was 
genotyped  using  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP 
array  6.0  and  processed  with  the  Birdseed  Genotyping 
Algorithm [17]. The BioBank Japan study was genotyped 
using  the  Illumina  Human610-Quad  BeadChip  (Illumina 
Inc.,  San Diego, CA, USA). A childhood obesity study was 
genotyped  using  the  Illumina  Omni1-Quad  BeadChip. 
Individuals were excluded as follows: genotyping call rate, 
sex  inconsistency,  heterozygosity,  identity-by-state  value, 
and any kinds of tumor. For more information, the study has 
been reported [15].

For  the  replication  study  in  Health2  (7,861),  we  per-
formed a genotype assay using the TaqMan reaction for four 
single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  (rs2074356, 
rs16940212,  rs12708980,  rs599839)  and  the  GoldenGate 
assay (Illumina Inc.) for nine SNPs (rs780092, rs10503669, 
rs2001945, rs603446, rs12686004, rs11216126, rs12229654, 
rs519113, rs12654264, rs2738446).  To  analyze  the  quality 
control, we conducted duplicate genotyping using 1-2.5% of 
samples. For further association analyses, concordance rates 
were satisfied with duplicates of over 99% and a genotype 
success rate of over 98%. 

SNP imputation 

In each GWAS data point, imputation analysis was per-
formed  using  the  IMPUTE  reference  HapMap  Asian 
(Japanese  [JPT]/Han  Chinese  [CHB])  population  panel, 
based on NCBI build 36 and dbSNP build 129. Of these, in 
each cohort, we dropped SNPs with a posterior probability 
score ＜ 0.90, high genotype information content (info ＜ 
0.5), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) (p ＜ 1 × 10－7), 
SNP missing rate ＞ 0.1, and minor allele frequency (MAF) 
＜ 0.01.  In  the  former  analysis,  only  imputed  SNPs  that 
satisfied the genomewide SNP quality control criteria were 
considered.

Association analysis

In performing the association tests, SNPs were analyzed 
with  PLINK  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) 
and SAS version 9.1 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
Individuals who were on lipid-lowering therapy and hyper-
tensive medications were excluded for dyslipidemia-related 
phenotypes,  such  as  TG,  HDL-C,  and  LDL-C.  LDL-C 
concentrations were calculated with Friedewald’s formula 
[18]. Missing values were assigned for individuals with TG 
over 400 mg/dL. The dyslipidemia-related phenotypes were 
tested  by  multivariate  linear  regression  analysis  in  an 
additive  genetic  model  (1-d.f.),  including  age,  sex,  and 
recruitment  area  as  covariates.  TG  and  HDL-C  were 
transformed  prior  to  analysis  using  natural  log  trans-
formation  to  remove  skewing.  LDL-C  was  normally

observed  between  allelic  dosage  score  and  risk  allele 
(rs10503669 at LPL) for high TG levels (effect size, 10.89 ± 
0.84) (Fig. 2).

Results

The clinical characteristics and statistics of the variables 
for each study sample are described in Table 1. Our previous 
large-scale GWAS identified 9 novel and 24 known genetic 
loci influencing metabolic traits in East Asians [9]. In an 
attempt to determine whether well-established lipid-related 
variants contribute to significant and reproducible genetic 
factors for susceptibility to blood lipid concentrations in a 
childhood obesity study, we first examined the associations 
between individual genetic variants and lipid-related phe-
notypes using linear regression analysis.

Of these 16 SNPs for blood lipid traits, rs10503669 in LPL 
(genotyped SNP in a childhood obesity study) was signi-
ficantly  associated  with  TG  and  HDL-C,  respectively.  In 
addition, rs16940212 in LIPC (linkage disequilibrium-based 
proxy  SNP)  was  associated  with  HDL-C  (Table  2).  The 
direction  of  these  associations  was  consistent  with  our 
previous GWAS [9].

Having two loci (rs10503669 at LPL and rs16940212 at 
LIPC)  showing  the  strongest  association  with  TG  and 
HDL-C, we next investigated whether the cumulative allelic 
dosage  of  risk  alleles  contributes  to  the  quantitative 
variation of lipoprotein concentrations in the KARE study 
using a method of calculating a GRS. We evaluated the joint 
effects of the best-associated SNPs at the two loci showing 
evidence of association with HDL-C (rs10503669 at LPL and 
rs16940212 at LIPC). We calculated a GRS, representing the 
sum of the risk alleles, and observed that increasing GRS was 
significantly associated with decreased HDL-C (effect size, 
－1.13 ± 0.07) compared to SNP combinations without two 

Discussion

Blood lipid levels are an important etiological contributor 
to  CVD.  CVD  is  the  leading  cause  of  death  among 
individuals  with  T2D,  in  which  lipid  abnormalities  are 
characterized  by  hypertriglyceridemia,  reduced  levels  of 
HDL-C, and elevated levels of LDL-C. These lipid-related 
traits, including ~14-54% for TG, ~34-42% for HDL-C, and 
~28-50% for LDL-C, are highly heritable in familial T2D or 
diabetic  patients  [19,  20].  These  estimates  indicate  that 
genetic  variants  play  important  roles  in  explaining  inter-
individual variations in blood lipid levels. 

Although systematic reviews have reported relationships 
between  childhood  obesity  and  adult  CVD  risk  [21,  22], 
there is not a shred of evidence that blood lipid status in 
adults  is  an  independent  or  dependent  risk  factor  in  a 
childhood obesity group. Early childhood obesity might be 
the best time for dyslipidemia intervention, including scree-
ning, early detection, and management. The aim of this study 
was  to  consolidate  the  associations  of  16  GWAS-based 
candidate variants with blood lipid concentrations across the 
lifespan.

In GWAS-based candidate approaches, the well-known 
LPL gene was significantly associated with low TG and high 
HDL-C levels in a childhood obesity study, respectively. This 
finding is well matched to the negative correlation between 
blood TG and HDL-C concentrations [23]. In addition, the 
LIPC gene was further observed in decreased HDL-C. In 
analyses of the joint effects of these variants, we found that 
GRSs on the two risk alleles (rs10503669 at LPL and

Fig. 1. Combined effects of risk alleles
on  high-density  lipoprotein  chole-
sterol  (HDL-C).  Allelic  dosage  scores 
are  plotted  on 
the  X  axis.  The 
histogram  (Y  axis  on  left,  grey  bars) 
represents  the  percentage  of  indivi-
duals in each risk allele category. The
histogram (Y axis on right, black bars) 
represents  mean  HDL-C  concen-
trations.  (A)  Eight  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs)  including  the 
risk  alleles  (rs10503669  at  LPL  and 
rs16940212  at  LIPC).  (B)  Six  SNPs 
without the risk alleles (rs10503669 at
LPL  and  rs16940212  at  LIPC).

Fig.  2.  Combined  effects  of  risk  al-
leles  on 
triglyceride  (TG).  Allelic 
dosage  scores  are  plotted  on  the  X 
axis.  The  histogram  (Y  axis  on  left, 
grey  bars)  represents  the  percentage 
of  individuals  in  each  risk  allele 
category.  The  histogram  (Y  axis  on 
right, black bars) represents mean TG
concentrations. (A) Five single nucle-
otide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  inclu-
ding  the  risk  allele  (rs10503669  at 
LPL).  (B)  Four  SNPs  without  the  risk
allele  (rs10503669  at  LPL). 

rs16940212  at  LIPC)  were  associated  with  a  cumulative 
effect of TG and HDL-C levels. However, these facts indicate 
that  currently  identified  risk  variants  might  have  low 
discriminatory ability and modest genetic contribution to 
disease prediction [24].

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an important role in lipid 
metabolism by hydrolyzing TGs of circulating chylomicrons 
and  very  low-density  lipoproteins.  In  addition,  LPL  is 
expressed in the brain regions that are functionally relevant 
to learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Many 
GWASs and meta-analyses have shown that variations in the 
well-known  LPL  gene  for  multiple  lipid-related  traits  are 
implicated in multiethnic populations [2, 3, 9, 25-28]. An 
increasing number of studies have suggested an association 
of LPL gene variants with the risk of cerebrovascular as well 
as CVD [29]. Recent genome-wide investigations identified 
schizophrenia-associated  loci  in  the  chromosome  8p22 
region, including LPL [30-32]. It was suggested that LPL is an 

attractive  candidate  gene  that  might  be  involved  in  the 
potential role of lipid metabolism in schizophrenia. Stages of 
early  childhood  development  can  be  taken  into  account 
when considering a diagnosis of mental illness [33].

Hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene encodes hepatic triglyceride 
lipase, which is expressed in liver. LIPC has a dual function as 
a  triglyceride  hydrolase  and  ligand/bridging  factor  for 
receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake. A GWAS has iden-
tified a possible role of LIPC in advanced age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD) [34]. AMD is an eye condition affecting 
the central part of the retina. Although a condition that is 
commonly associated with the elderly, macular degeneration 
affects younger people through a rare inherited condition 
[35]. Based on a lack of direct relationships between HDL-C 
and AMD risk, the LIPC association may not be the result of 
an  effect  on  HDL-C  levels,  but  it  could  represent  a 
pleiotropic  effect  as  a  functional  component,  such  as  a 
lipoprotein  transporter,  underlying  the  biological  mecha-

nisms involving the cholesterol pathway.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the genetic 
architecture  of  circulating  lipid  levels  (TG  and  HDL-C) 
overlap to a large extent in childhood as well as in adulthood. 
A genetic risk assessment by incorporating two risk alleles 
suggests encouraging evidence that identified genetic risk 
variants for lipid phenotypes have cumulative effects on lipid 
concentrations.  Post-GWAS  functional  characterization  of 
these  variants  is  further  required  to  elucidate  the  patho-
physiological role and biological mechanisms.
