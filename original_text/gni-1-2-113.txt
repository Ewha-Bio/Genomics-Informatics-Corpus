Abstract 

Among a number of antigens characterized in M.  /eprae,  an 
etiological  agent of  Leprosy,  the  18 kDa antigen,  is  unique 
toM.  /eprae.  We  have  previously  determined  a sequence 
specific  element  in  the  18  kDa  gene  of  M.  leprae,  which 
confers  transcriptional  repression.  In  this  report,  we  have 
examined  if  the  element  could  be  applied  to  genes  other 
than the  18 kDa  gene of M.  leprae.  To  identify the  roles  of 
the regulatory sequence in heterologous promoter, we have 
constructed  pB3  vector series,  which  contains  BCG  hsp65 
promoter and the M.  leprae  18 kDa transcription  repression 
responsive  element  in  tandem  using  LacZ gene  as  a 
reporter gene. Cloning of hsp65 promoters of M.  bovis BCG 
or M.  smegmatis in front of LacZ gene resulted in normal (3-
galactosidase  activity  as  expected.  However,  when  the 
sequence  element  was  placed  between  the  promoter and 
the LacZ gene, (3-galactosidase activity was reduced 1 0-fold 
less.  Also  we  have  examined  with  pB3(-)  vector,  that 
harbors the transcription repression responsive element in a 
reversed orientation,  the (3-galactosidase activity was found 
to  be  similar to  pB3(+)  vector.  Thus,  these  results  further 
confirm  that  M.  /eprae  18  kDa  transcription  repression 
responsive  element  could  regulate  BCG  hsp65 
heterologous promoter and that the element could act as an 
operator for the transcription of mycobacteria.

leprae  and  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  (Mulder et a/., 
1999). 18 kDa antigen is one of the various antigens found 
in  M.  leprae,  it is  specific-antigen  in  M.leprae  and  may be 
involved in survival of M.  leprae with  in  macrophage during 
infection  (Dellagostin  et a/.,  1995).  It  has  been  suggested 
that  the  expression  of  18kDa gene  might  be  regulated  by 
sequence-specific  transcriptional  repressor  that  binds  to 
the regulatory sequence. 

Recently,  there  became  much  researches  about  the 
genetic  elements  that  contribute  to  the  control  of  gene 
expression  in  mycobacteria.  Since  many  mycobacterial 
promoters  and  transcriptional  initiation  have  been  studied, 
consensus  promoter  sequences  have  been  proposed. 
However,  many  of  these  promoters  are  specifically 
regulated  (Ramesh  et at.,  1995;  Bashyam  eta/.,  1996). 
Some of the mycobacterial promoters resemble the typical 
E.  coli consensus  promoter and  function  in  this  organism, 
but most have a higher G+C content and  differ from  the E. 
coli consensus  promoters.  It  has  been  shown  that  these 
promoters function  more efficiently in  Streptomyces than in 
E.  coli (Kieser eta/.,  1986).  In  general  mycobacteria  have 
G+C-rich genomes.  It is known that,  in bacteria,  the overall 
G+C  contents  of  the  genome  affects  the  choice  of 
translation  initiation  and  termination,  and  the  promoter 
recognition  sites  for  RNA  polymerase  (Nakayama  et a/., 
1989;  Ohama  eta/.,  1987).  A study  of  mycobacterial 
promoters  is  necessary for  not  only  understanding  about 
the  mycobacterial  transcriptional  machinery  but  also  a 
better understanding  of the  genetic basis for the  observed 
phenomena of gene regulation in various mycobacteria. 

We  have previously found  a sequence specific element 
in  the  18  kDa  gene  of M.  /eprae,  which  confers  transcrip(cid:173)
tional  repression  for  the  gene.  In  this  report,  we  have 
examined  if  the  element  could  be  applied  to  genes  other 
than  the  18  kDa  gene  of  M.  /eprae.  To  do  so,  we  have 
investigated  the  gene  expression  control  of  hsp65 
promoters  of  M.  bovis  BCG  or  M.  smegmatis  by  the 
regulatory sequence of M.  leprae 18 kDa gene. 

Materials and Methods 
Bacterial strains and media 
E.  coli  DH1 OB  was  grown  in  Luria-Bertani  (LB)  media. 
Transformed  E.  coli were  selected  on  LB  media with  100 
(Jg/ml  of  ampicillin  or  40  (Jg/ml  kanamycin.  M.  smegmatis 
mc2  155,  which  was  used  to  propagate  vectors  for 
mycobacterium,  was  grown  in  Middlebrook 7H9  broth 

114  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1 (2) 113-118, December 2003 

containing  0.2%  glycerol  and  0.05%  Tween-80  at  37"C 
shaking  incubator.  Transformed  mycobacteria  were 
selected on LB agar containing 40 {Jg/ml  kanamycin. 

Transformation of M. smegmatis 
M.  smegmatis  md155  competent  cells  were  transformed 
by  electroporation  methods  using  1 O%(v/v)  glycerol 
(Jacobs eta/.,  1991 ).  For electroporation, the Gene  Pulser 
(Bio-Rad)  was  set  at  2.5  KV  and  25  iJ,F,  and  the  pulse 
controller  resistance  was  set  at  1 000 Q.  Recombinant 
DNAs were then  added to  100  p.l  of mycobacterial cells in 
0.4  em  electrode  gap  cuvette.  After electroporation,  diluted 
into 0.5  ml  of broth,  incubated for 1 hr at 3rc with shaking 
before  plating  and  then  the  cell  were  plated  on  LB  agar 
containing 40 {Jg/ml  kanamycin and incubated at 37"C  for 3 
days. 

PCR amplification 
Genomic  DNA  were  purified  from  M.  bovis  BCG  and  M. 
smegmatis  md 155 as  described by Jacobs eta/.  (1991). 
PCR  amplification  of the  mycobacterial  hsp65  promoter 
sequences  was  performed  using  M.  bovis  BCG  and  M. 
smegmatis md 155 genomic DNA as the template with the 
5'  -primer (hsp1  ; 5'  -GGG TCT AGA CGG TGA CCA CM 
CCA CGC G-3'  and 3' -primer (hsp2  ; 5' -GGG TCT AGA 
CGC GTC CGG ATC GGG GAT G-3') resulting 383-bp in 
length.  PCR  was  performed  in  50  p.l  reaction  mixture 
containing  10 mM Tris-HCI (pH8.3),  1.5 mM MgCI2, 50 mM 
KCI,  10  mM  dNTP,  1 U of  Taq  polymerase,  10  pmol  of 
each  set  of  primers,  and  about  1 00  ng  of template  DNA. 
The  amplification  mixture were  subjected to 5 min at 94 oc 
and 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 oc,  1 min at 60"C  and 1 min at 
72°c,  and  then  10 min at 72°c.  PCR  products were  used 
for cloning by purifying with GeneCiean Kit. 

Vector construction 
Vector pMOGAL-BCG  and  pMOGAL-MS  were  constructed 
by cloning  the  383-bp Xba  I - Xba  I  fragment  from  PCR 
product,  which were amplified by using M.  bovis BCG and 
M.  smegmatis  genomic  DNA  respectively,  into  the  Xba  I 
site  of  pMOGAL  vector containing  the  promoterless-LacZ 
gene and kanamycin resistance gene (Fig.  1 ). 

Another  derivatives,  60-bp  synthetic  oligomer 
corresponding  the  regulatory  element of the  M.  leprae  18 
kDa  gene  was  digested  with  Xbal  and  cloned  into  the 
corresponding  restriction  sites of pBiuescript SK(-)  to yield 
pSK(-)-3G DNA vectors. Because same cloning site Q<1:E I ) 
was  used,  both  forward  and  reverse  orientation  were 
existed,  it was named as (+)and (-) respectively. A 383-
bp  Sa/  1-BamH  I fragment  containing  the  BCG  hsp65 
promoter from  pMOGAL-BCG  was  replaced  with  same 
sites in  pSK(-)-3G  DNA vector series to produce the pSK(-

)-(BCG+3G).  A 451-bp  Sail-Not I fragment  from  pSK(-)(cid:173)
(BCG+3G)  vector  was  generated  blunt-end  by  klenow 
enzyme  and  then  cloned  into  blunt-ended Xba  I  site  of 
pMOGAL vector to construct the pB3 vector series (Fig.  2). 
These  constructed  vectors  contain  both  M.  bovis  BCG 
hsp65  promoter  region  and  regulatory  sequence  of  M. 
/eprae  18 kDa gene. 

;3-galactosidase assay 
For  the  P-galactosidase  activity  assays,  M.  smegmatis 
transformants  were  grown  in  Middlebrook  7H9  broth 
containing  40  {Jg/ml  kanamycin,  0.2%  glycerol  and  0.05% 
Tween-80  at 31 C with  aeration  by  shaking.  The P-galac(cid:173)
tosidase  activity  assays  were  performed  according  to  the 
Miller' method  (Miller,  1972),  and  the  assay condition  was 
as follows. 

After  M.  smegmatis  transformants  were  grown  to  late 
exponential  phase,  0.5  ml  of  bacterial  suspension  were 
mixed with 0.5  ml  of Z buffer (6 mM NaH2P04,  1 0 mM KCI, 
50  mM P-mercaptoethanol,  1 mM  MgS04),  the  cells  were 
lysed  by  adding  both  20  p.l  of  chloroform  and  1 0  p.l  of 
0.1%  SDS  to  each  assay  mixture.  Vortex  the  tubes  for  1 
min  and  place  the  tubes  in  a 28° C water bath  for  5 min. 
The  reaction was started by adding  100  f1[  of ONPG(4 mg/ 
ml)  to  each  tube,  and shake the  tubes for a few seconds. 
After  sufficient yellow  color  has  developed,  stop  the 
reaction  by  adding  200  f1[ of  1 M  Na2COs  and  then 
centrifuge  at  13,000  rpm  for  5 min.  For  each  tube,  the 
optical  density was  read  at  420  nm  and  at  550  nm.  P(cid:173)

Results 
Construction of reporter vectors driven by 
heterologous promoters 
In  order to determine whether the transcriptional activation 
could  be  induced  by  heterologous  promoters,  we  have 
constructed  the  pMOGAL -BCG  and  pMOGAL -MS  vectors. 
PCR amplification was used to amplify the hsp65 promoter 
region  from  M.  bovis  BCG  and  M.  smegmatis  mc2155. 
These promoters region were cloned as a 382-bp in  length 
Xba  I - Xba  I fragment  into the  upstream  of LacZ gene  of 
pMOGAL vector,  which  contained promoterless-LacZ gene 
and  kanamycin  resistance  gene.  The  resulting  vectors

were name as pMOGAL-BCG and the pMOGAL-MS vector, 
respectively  (Fig.  1).  Using  these  constructed  pMOGAL(cid:173)
BCG  and  pMOGAL-MS  vectors,  we  have  investigated  the 
transcriptional activity by heterologous promoters. We have 
used the  promoterless  pMOGAL vector and  non-regulated 
pM4GAL  vector as  controls  to  compare  the  ;9-galactosi(cid:173)
dase activity with derivative vectors. 

In order to identify whether the regulatory element of M. 
leprae  18 kDa gene could confer transcriptional  repression 
in  other heterologous  promoter,  we  have  also constructed 
pB3 vector series (Fig.  2). pB3 vector series contains BCG 
hsp65  promoter  region  from  PeR-amplification,  the  M. 
/eprae  18 kDa transcription  repression  responsive  element 
from synthesized oligomers, and LacZ gene from pMOGAL 
vector  in  tandem.  pB3(+)  vector  and  pB3(-)  vector, 
containing  differently-oriented fragment  of  the  regulatory 
sequence,  were  also  tested  for ;9-galactosidase  activity to 
examine  the  effect  by  orientation  of  the  regulatory 
sequence. 

Expression of fi-galactosidase gene 
in different promoters 
To  investigate  the  transcriptional  activation  by  hsp65 
promoter,  which  originated  from  M.  bovis  BCG  and  M. 
smegmatis, pMOGAL-BCG vector and pMOGAL-MS vector 
were  electroporated  into  M.  smegmatis  and  tested  for fi(cid:173)
galactosidase  activity.  pMOGAL  vector  showed  the 
background fi-galactosidase activity but pMOGAL-BCG and 
pMOGAL-MS  vectors  showed  high  promoter activities  and 
these  activities  were  corresponded  about  60-80%  to 
activity  of  pM4GAL vector  (Fig.  3).  In  these  results,  we 
suggested  that  BCG  hsp65  promoter,  which  originated 
from  other strain,  was  recognized  by  transcription 
apparatus of M.  smegmatis. 

Effects of regulatory sequence 
on hsp65 promoter activity 
To  examine  the  effects  of  the  regulator  sequence  of M. 
/eprae  18  kDa  gene  on  heterologous  promoters  and 
different strains,  two vectors were  constructed  and  named 
pB3(+)  and  pB3(-)  vectors,  which  contained  hsp65 
promoter,  regulatory  sequence  of  M.  leprae,  and  LacZ 
gene  in  tandem.  The  constructs  were  assayed  the  fi(cid:173)
galactosidase  activity  in  M.  smegmatis.  Insertion  of 
regulatory  sequence  to  the  pMOGAL -BCG  resulted  in  an 
1 0-fold  reduction  in  activity than  pMOGAL -BCG  vector  in 
M.  smegmatis  and  reached  to  the  background  (3-
galactosidase activity like  pMOGAL (Fig.  4).  Also,  we  have 
found  the  similar activity  with  pB3(-)  vector,  which 
contained  the  regulatory  sequence  in  a  reversed 
orientation,  as  have  seen  with  pB3(+)  vector.  The  results 
indicate  that  the  orientation  of  regulatory  element  is  not

These  results  indicate  clearly  that  regulatory  sequence 
of M.  leprae  18 kDa gene can  also affect the  transcription 
not only by homologous promoter but also by heterologous 
promoter  and  regulatory  sequence  of  M.  leprae  18  kDa 
gene  can  regulate  the  expression  in  different  strains 
because M. smegmatis strain used for mycobacterial host. 

Discussion 
We have studied about heterologous promoter activity and 
mycobacterial  transcription  repression  by  regulatory 
element  using  the  mycobacterial  promoterless  vector, 
which  contained  the  fi-galactosidase  reporter  gene.  Using

signals  are  conserved  among  the  mycobacteria.  It  has 
been  demonstrated  that  the  efficiency  and  specificity  of 
transcriptional  recognition  is  conserved  in  fast-growing  M. 
smegmatis  and  slowly-growing  M.  tuberculosis  and  M. 
bovis BCG, since the promoters examined exhibited similar 
activities  and  utilized  the  same  transcription  start  sites  in 
these  hosts  (Bashyam  et at.,  1996).  Therefore,  M. 
smegmatis  may  be  used  as  a  surrogate  host  for 
mycobacterial expression study because  it  is fast growing, 
nonpathogenic,  and  more  easily transformable  than  other 
mycobacterial  species  (Hasson et at.,  1990).  Although  the 
recognition  of  promoter  sequences  appears  to  be 
conserved  among  the  mycobacteria,  there  may  be  small 
differences  in  the  transcription  machinery  between  slowly 
growing  bacteria  and  fast  growing  bacteria  (Timm  eta/., 
1994). 

Many prokaryotic genes are regulated  by environmental 
conditions  or  by  growth  phase.  These  regulations  usually 
involve the binding of either a repressor or activator protein 
to sequences within or upstream of promoter. 

It is known that M.  leprae  18 kDa  promoter exhibits low 
levels  of  expression  in  bacterial  culture,  but  shows  high 
levels  of  expression  in  macrophage  (Dellagostin  et at., 
1995).  The  expression  of  18 kDa  gene  is  regulated  by  a 
sequence-specific transcription  repression  responsive 
element  and  its  cognate  repressor,  which  binds  to  the 
element.  In  this  study,  to  investigate  the  heterologous 
transcriptional  repression  activity of this  element,  we  have 
constructed  pB3  vector  series  contained  BCG  hsp65 
promoter and  regulatory  element  and  then  pertormed  the 
fi-galactosidase  assay  (Fig.  2).  In  these  vectors,  fi-

Fig. 4.  Regulation of M.  bovis BCG hsp65 promoter by M.  leprae 
18  kDa  regulatory  element in  M.  smegmatis.  jJ-galactosidase 
activity  per  mg  protein  was  measured  in  M.  smegmatis 
transformants  during  extracellular growth.  Data  were  presented 
as an  average of two or three experiments. The sequence of the 
regulatory  element  is  : 5'  -CTAGATCGACCAGTGCTATATCAA 
ATCTATGTAGTCAGGAACAGCATGCT-3'  (+orientation). 

galactosidase  activity  was  reduced  1 0-fold  less  than 
pMOGAL  vector,  which  contained  BCG  hsp65  promoter 
alone  and  showed  similar fi-galactosidase  activity  both 
p83( +)  vector  and  p83(-)  vectors  which  harbors  the 
transcription  repression  responsive  element  in  a reversed 
orientation (Fig. 4). 

From these results, we could conclude that the regulator 
element  of  M.  /eprae  18  kDa  gene  could  regulate  the 
heterologous BCG hsp65 promoter and regulatory element 
may function regardless of orientation.
