Abstract

Obesity  provokes  many  serious  human  diseases,  includ-
ing  various  cardiovascular  diseases  and  diabetes.  Body 
mass  index  (BMI)  is  a  highly  heritable  trait  that  is  broad-
ly  used  to  diagnose  obesity.  To  identify  genetic  loci  as-
sociated  with  obesity  in  Asians,  we  conducted  a  ge-
nome-wide  association  study  (GWAS)  of  a  population  of 
Korean  adults  (n=6,742,  age  40∼60  years)  and  de-
tected  six  BMI  risk  loci  (TNR,  FAM124B,  RGS12, 
NFE2L3,  MC4R  and  FTO)  having  p＜1×10－5.  However, 
in  the  replication  study,  only  melanocortin  4  receptor 
gene  (MC4R)  (rs9946888,  p=4.58×10－7)  was  replicated 
with  marginal  significance  (p＜0.05)  in  the  second  co-
hort  (n=5,102,  age  40∼60  years).  This  study  indicates 
that  each  locus  associated  with  BMI  has  very  weak  ge-
netic  effect.

Introduction

Obesity,  which  results  from  chronically  consuming  more 
calories  than  the  body  requires  (Thorleifsson  et al., 
2009),  is  one  of  the  most  serious  public  health  problems 
of  the  21st  century.  In  recent  decades,  the  prevalence  of

obesity  has  rapidly  increased  worldwide,  and  is  asso-
ciated  with  an  increase  in  a  number  of  diseases,  includ-
ing  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM),  hypertension,  dysli-
pidemia,  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD),  sleep  apnea  and 
certain  cancers  (Haslam  and  James,  2005).  According  to 
the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO),  as  many  as  400 
million  people  around  the  world  are  considered  to  be 
obese  (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/ 
en/index.html).  Body  mass  index  (BMI),  defined  as 
weight  (in  kilograms)  divided  by  the  square  of  height  (in 
meters),  is  the  most  widely  used  measure  to  diagnose 
obesity.  A  BMI  cutoff  ≥30  kg/m2  has  demonstrated 
good  specificity  in  diagnosing  obesity;  however,  the  ac-
curacy  of  BMI  in  diagnosing  obesity  is  limited  by  the  in-
ability  of  this  index  to  discriminate  between  fat  and  lean 
mass  (Romero-Corral  et al.,  2008). 
    Several  recent  studies  have  reported  results  of  ge-
nome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  for  BMI  (Meyre 
et al.,  2009;  Thorleifsson et al.,  2009;  Willer et al.,  2009), 
including  Koreans  (Cho et al.,  2009).  These  studies  vali-
dated  FTO  (fat  mass  and  obesity  associated)  and MC4R 
(melanocortin  4  receptor)  as  major  BMI-associated 
genes,  and  also  discovered  15  additional  loci  that  influ-
enced  BMI  (Hofker  and  Wijmenga,  2009).  To  date,  most 
GWAS  for  BMI  have  been  based  on  samples  from 
European  populations.  Asians  generally  have  a  higher 
percentage  of  body  fat  than  Caucasians  at  the  same 
age,  sex  and  BMI  (WHO  Expert  Consultation,  2004).  In 
addition,  the  proportion  of  Asian  people  with  risk  factors 
for  T2DM  and  CVD  is  different  from  that  of  Caucasians 
(WHO  Expert  Consultation,  2004).  Thus,  in  this  study, 
we  conducted  a  GWAS  to  identify  BMI  risk  loci  in  the 
Korean  population  and  tested  whether  risk  loci  identified 
in  previous  studies  could  be  validated 
in  Asians. 
Particularly,  we  used  a  subset  of  subjects  with  age  ≤60 
years  since  the  relationship  between  BMI  and  body  fat 
are  weak  in  older  adults. 

Methods

Subjects 

recruited 

For  GWAS,  subjects  were 
from  Ansung 
(n=5,018)  and  Ansan  (n=5,020)  population-based  co-
horts,  established  as  part  of  the  Korean  Genome 
Epidemiology  Study  (KoGES)  in  2001.  Both  were  de-
signed  to  allow  longitudinal  prospective  studies  and

adopted  the  same  investigational  strategy.  Participants 
have  been  examined  every  two  years  since  baseline  ex-
amination;  the  third  follow-up  study  was  completed  in 
late  2008.  KoGES  provided  extensive  phenotypic  data 
for  over  260  traits  (Cho  et al.,  2009),  but  here  we  fo-
cused  on  an  analysis  of  BMI.  For  replication,  subjects 
were  obtained  from  another  population-based  cohort 
provided  by  the  Health2  study.  It  combined  subjects 
from  the  Wonju,  Pyeong  Chang,  Gangneung,  Geumsan, 
and  Naju  regional  cohorts  in  Korea,  and  has  adopted 
standards  for  quantitative  trait  measurement  that  are  al-
most  identical  to  those  adopted  for  the  Ansung  and 
Ansan  cohorts.  The  basic  characteristics  of  the  two  co-
horts  used  in  the  GWAS  and  replication  study  are 
shown  in  Table  1. 

Genotyping  and  quality  control

The  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project  was  ini-
tiated  in  2007  to  undertake  a  large-scale  GWAS  among 
the  Ansung  and  Ansan  participants.  Of  the  10,038  par-
ticipants,  DNA  was  available  for  10,004  individuals;  all 
were  genotyped  using  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide 
Human  SNP  array  5.0.  After  removing  samples  with  low 
call  rates  (＜96%,  n=401),  sample  contamination  (n=11), 
gender  inconsistencies  (n=41),  cryptic  relatedness  (n= 
608)  or  serious  concomitant  illness  (n=101),  SNP  geno-
type  data  from  8,842  individuals  were  available  for 
GWAS.  Of  the  500,568  SNPs  genotyped  using  the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0,  104,831 
were  excluded  on 
the  basis  of  call-rate  cut-off 
(＜99.0%)  and  63,380  were  excluded  on  the  basis  of 
minor  allele  frequency  cut-off  (MAF＜0.001).  The  re-
maining  334,546  SNPs  were  ultimately  investigated  as 
part  of  the  GWAS  of  BMI.  Genotyping  for  the  replication 
study  was  completed  using  the  GoldenGate  assay 
(Illumina,  San  Diego,  CA,  USA).  Genotype  clustering  and 
calling  were  performed  using  BeadStudio  software 
(Illumina).  Overall  genotyping  success  rate  was  95.4%. 
Among  the  6  genotyped  SNPs,  all  SNP  sites  were  in 
Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium  (HWE)  (p-value  for  HWE= 
0.3441∼0.8248)  except  one  SNP  (rs9939609).  The  SNP 
(rs9939609)  in  FTO  gene  was  significantly  deviated  from 
HWE  (p-value  for  HWE=1.67×10－250)  and  excluded  in 

Statistical  analysis

In  total,  8,838  individuals  were  used  for  initial  analysis 
after  removing  four  subjects  for  whom  BMI  values  were 
not  available.  However,  since  BMI  decreased  after  age 
60  years  in  our  data  set,  we  excluded  subjects  older 
than  60  years,  and  used  only  samples  from  individuals 
in  the  40∼60  year-old  age  group  (n=6,742).  Statistical 
analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  (version  18.0) 
(SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA)  and  PLINK  (version  1.07) 
(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/plink/)  programs. 
In  this  study,  associations  between  each  SNP  and  BMI 
were  tested  by  linear  regression  analysis  assuming  addi-
tive,  dominant  and  recessive  models,  and  adjusting  for 
age,  area  and  sex.  Power  calculation  was  performed  us-
ing  the  Quanto  (http://hydra.usc.edu/gxe/)  software  to 
compute  the  statistical  power  of  our  study. 

Results

Genome-wide  association  study  for  BMI  and 
replication  study

To  identify  genetic  loci  associated  with  BMI,  we  con-
ducted  a  GWAS  using  BMI  data  from  a  population  of 
6,742  adult  Koreans,  aged  40∼60  years.  Association 
analyses  were  performed  by  multiple  linear  regression 
analysis  under  additive,  dominant  and  recessive  models, 
adjusting  for  age,  area  and  sex.  Initially,  a  total  of  15 
SNPs  in  seven  loci  reached  arbitrary  significance 
threshold  p＜10－5  for  BMI.  To  confirm  the  significance 
of  SNP  associations  with  BMI,  we  performed  subgroup 
analysis  by  splitting  the  samples  into  two  different 
cohort  groups,  Ansung  (n=2,690)  and  Ansan  (n=4,052). 
In  subgroup  analysis,  12  SNPs  in  six  genes  -  TNR 
(tenascin  R),  FAM124B (family  with  sequence  similarity 
124B), RGS12 (regulator  of  G-protein  signaling  12), FTO, 
MC4R and  NFE2L3 (nuclear  factor  [erythroid-derived 
2]-like  3)  -  remained  the  significance  with  p＜0.01  in 
both  Ansung  and  Ansan  cohorts  (Table  2).  For  repli-
cation,  we  selected  6  index  SNPs  representative  of  the 
6  BMI  risk  loci.  Of  these,  rs9939609  in  FTO  locus 
showed  significant  deviation  from  HWE  (p-value  for 
HWE=1.67×10－250)  and  therefore  it  was  excluded  in 
further  association  analysis.  Of  the  remaining  5  SNPs, 
one  SNP  (rs9946888)  in MC4R locus  showed  very  weak 
association  (p＜0.05)  in  the  same  direction.  Furthermore, 
however,  its  genetic  mode  was  different  from  that  of 
GWAS  (Table  3).  In  addition,  in  the  combined  analysis 
of  the  GWAS  and  replication  study,  SNPs  in  TNR 
(rs12060150)  and  MC4R  (rs9946888)  genes  showed

BMI  is  a  typical  quantitative  trait  used  broadly  in  diag-
nosing  obesity,  and  exhibits  a  heritability  of  approx-
imately  0.4∼0.7  (Atwood et al.,  2002;  Maes et al.,  1997; 
Willer et al.,  2009).  Recently,  we  conducted  a  GWAS  for 
eight  traits,  including  BMI,  using  data  from  8,842  in-
dividuals  in  the  KARE  project.  Initially,  we  simply  con-
firmed  the  association  of  BMI  with  previously  known 
FTO  (rs9939609,  p=1.7×10－6),  MC4R  (rs17782313, 
p=1.9×10－4)  and CTNNB1 (catenin  beta  1;  rs6067731, 
p=0.023)  genes  among  Koreans  (Cho et al.,  2009).  Here, 
we  sought  to  identify  further  BMI  risk  loci  by  selecting 
specific  subsets  of  the  same  data.  It  is  known  that  the 
relationships  between  BMI  and  body  fat  and  fat  dis-
tribution  are  weak  in  older  adults  (age≥65  years) 
(Janssen  and  Mark,  2007).  In  addition,  many  age-related 
diseases  cause  weight  loss;  thus,  the  aged  may  weigh 
less  than  the  typical  adult  as  a  result  of  diagnosed  ill-
ness  (Janssen  and  Mark,  2007).  Consistent  with  this,  a 
phenotypic  analysis  of  our  BMI  data  showed  that  BMI 
gradually  increased  from  age  40  to  60  years,  but  de-
creased  after  age  60  years  (data  not  shown).  Therefore, 
in  this  study,  we  excluded  subjects  older  than  60  years, 
and  used  only  samples  from  individuals  in  the  40∼60 
year-old  age  group  (n=6,742).  Focusing  on  this  sub-
group  provided  greater  statistical  power  for  detecting 
BMI  risk  loci  than  was  achieved  by  including  all  8,842 
samples  in  the  analysis  (data  not  shown). 
    As  a  result  of  the  first  GWA  analysis  of  specific  age 
group,  we  identified  six  BMI  risk  loci  (Table  2).  Among 
them,  one  SNP  in MC4R gene  locus  was  significant  in 
the  same  direction  in  the  second  replication  study,  al-
though  its  genetic  mode  was  different.  An  association 
between  the  MC4R gene  and  obesity  has  been  ex-
tensively  reported  in  many  populations  (Hinney  et al., 
2006;  Huszar  et al.,  1997;  Kublaoui  and  Zinn,  2006; 
Marti et al.,  2003),  including  our  previous  report  (Cho et 
al.,  2009).  Except  MC4R  gene,  we  could  not  find  any 
significance  in  the  candidate  BMI  risk  loci  in  the  repli-
cation  study.  The  lack  of  replication  of  genetic  associa-
tion  with  BMI  detected  by  GWAS  can  be  due  to  either 
heterogeneity  between  GWAS  and  replication  study  or 
insufficient  sample  size.  The  heterogeneity  test  demon-
strated  the  presence  of  heterogeneity  between  GWAS 
and  replication  study  (Table  3).  The  heterogeneity  prob-
ably  affected  the  lack  of  replication  of  genetic  associa-
tion  with  BMI.  However,  we  think  that  sample  size  is  not 

respectively 

a  problem  in  our  study  to  detect  association  signal.  In 
the  power  calculation  on  our  study,  we  found  that  the 
most  significant  SNPs  detected  at  dominant  mode  (in 
FAM124B,  RGS12  &  NFE2L3  genes)  and  recessive 
mode  (TNR  &  MC4R  genes)  showed  greater  than  81% 
and  99%  statistical  power, 
(data  not 
shown).  This  data  indicate  that  the  sample  size  (a  total 
of  11,844  subjects  in  combined  data)  used  in  this  study 
is  sufficient  to  detect  SNPs  associated  with  BMI.  For 
GWAS  analysis,  we  used  arbitrary  significance  p-value 
threshold,  p＜1.0×10－5,  which  is  not  reaching  to  ge-
nome-wide  significance  p-value  (p=1.49×10－7,  after 
bon  ferroni  correction  for  334,546  SNPs  used).  This  may 
explain  the  possible  cause  of  no  replication  in  the  sec-
ond  sample  set.  Our  results  indicate  that  GWAS  has  a 
limitation  to  identify  causal  genes  for  BMI,  as  previously 
demonstrated  with  missing  heritability  for  complex  traits 
(Bogardus,  2009;  Manolio  et al.,  2009).
    In  summary,  we  sought  to  identify  additional  genetic 
variants  influencing  BMI  by  analyzing  specific  subsets  of 
previously  reported  GWAS  data  and  replication  study.  In 
this  study,  we  confirmed  the  association  of MC4R with 
BMI.  However,  we  failed  to  identify  new  genetic  variants 
associated  with  BMI  in  Koreans.
