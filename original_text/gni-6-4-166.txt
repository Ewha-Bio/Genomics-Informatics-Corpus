Abstract

A  multitude  of  protein-coding  sequence  variations  (CVs) 
in  the  human  genome  have  been  revealed  as  a  result  of 
major  initiatives,  including  the  Human  Variome  Project, 
the  1000  Genomes  Project,  and  the  International  Cancer 
Genome  Consortium.  This  naturally  has  led  to  debate 
over  how  to  accurately  assess  the  functional  con-
sequences  of  CVs,  because  predicting  the  functional  ef-
fects  of  CVs  and  their  relevance  to  disease  phenotypes 
is  becoming  increasingly  important.  This  article  surveys 
and  compares  variation  databases  and  in silico  pre-
diction  programs  that  assess  the  effects  of  CVs  on  pro-
tein  function.  We  also  introduce  a  combinatorial  ap-
proach  that  uses  machine  learning  algorithms  to  im-
prove  prediction  performance.

Introduction

Single  amino  acid  substitutions  in  protein-coding  se-
quences  are  common  in  the  human  genome.  These  pro-
tein-coding  sequence  variations  (CVs)  are  important  di-
agnostic  markers  and  therapeutic  targets  in  genetic  dis-
ease  studies.  Although  most  CVs  are  functionally  neu-
tral,  some  CVs  affect  phenotype, 
including  non-
synonymous  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (nsSNPs) 
that  contribute  to  normal  phenotypic  differences  in  hair 
color,  skin  color  (Sulem et al.,  2007;  Han et al.,  2008), 
and  disease  susceptibility  (WTCCC,  2007;  Amos  et al., 
2008;  Harley  et al.,  2008;  Tenesa  et al.,  2008).  Other

CVs  result  in  deleterious  missense  mutations  that  cause 
highly  penetrant  Mendelian-inherited  diseases  (Kim  et 
al.,  2007).  These  deleterious  mutations  have  been  of 
great  interest  in  biomedical  research  and  clinical  prac-
tice  for  decades  and  account  for  approximately  half  of 
the  genetic  variations  that  are  known  to  cause  disease.
    Using  recent  advancements 
tech-
nologies,  several  studies  have  reported  a  number  of  se-
quence  variations  in  certain  cancers  (Sjoblom  et al., 
2006;  Greenman  et al.,  2007;  Campbell  et al.,  2008; 
Jones  et al.,  2008),  in  which  mutational  patterns  have 
differed  greatly  between  patients  with  the  same  disease. 
Furthermore,  major  initiatives,  such  as  the  Human 
Variome  Project,  the  1000  Genomes  Project,  and  the 
International  Cancer  Genome  Consortium,  will  generate 
a  vast  amount  of  variation  data.  Consequently,  it  is  im-
portant  to  assess  variations  in  conjunction  with  protein 
function  and  disease  phenotype.  Several  databases, 
such  as  the  Online  Mendelian  Inheritance  in  Man 
(OMIM)  and 
the  Human  Gene  Mutation  Database 
(HGMD),  have  documented  CVs  that  correspond  to 
Mendelian-inherited  human  diseases.  In  addition,  many 
computational  programs  have  been  created  to  predict 
the  functional  effects  of  unknown  CVs  (Ng et al.,  2006; 
Care et al.,  2007).  Database  searches  and  bioinformatic 
predictions  can  be  useful  in  prioritizing  novel  CVs  for 
further  analysis.
    In  this  review,  we  summarize  the  databases  that  are 
most  helpful  in  interpreting  the  functional  effects  of  CVs. 
We  perform  an  extensive  survey  of  existing in silico  pre-
diction  methods  and  compare  their  performance.  Finally, 
we  introduce  a  combination  method  as  a  promising  ap-
proach  to  improve  prediction  performance.

Polymorphism  and  Mutation  Databases

Several  databases  that  are  helpful  in  assessing  the 
functional  effects  of  CVs  or  their  relevance  to  disease 
phenotype  are  listed  in  Table  1.  Each  of  two  broad-cat-
egory  mutation  databases,  general  mutation  databases 
(GMDBs)  and  locus-specific  mutation  databases  (LSDBs), 
has  unique  strengths  and  weaknesses  (Porter  et al., 
2000).  Because  polymorphism  and  mutation  databases 
have  been  developed  for  different  uses,  they  comple-
ment  each  other.

OMIM

OMIM  is  among  the  most  representative  and  well-docu-
mented  GMDBs,  and  it  contains  a  full-text  overview  of 
human  genes  and  genetic  disorders.  The  contents  of 
OMIM  are  considered  comprehensive,  authoritative,  and 
timely,  because  they  are  written  at  Johns  Hopkins 
University  School  of  Medicine  and  edited  daily  with  in-
put  from  scientists  and  physicians  from  around  the 
world  (Hamosh  et al.,  2005).  Many  CVs  that  are  regis-
tered  in  OMIM  may  have  deleterious  effects  on  protein 
function  and  cause  Mendelian-inherited  diseases.  OMIM 
also  includes  some  disease  susceptibility  variations  that 
are  found  in  association  analyses.  OMIM  is  therefore  a 
valuable  resource  to  study  the  characteristics  of  varia-
tions  that  severely  affect  a  certain  phenotype.

HGMD

HGMD  is  a  comprehensive  and  publicly  available  GMDB 
of  gene  lesions  that  underlie  human  inherited  diseases 
(Krawczak et al.,  2000;  Stenson et al.,  2003;  Stenson et 
al.,  2008).  Two  different  versions  of  the  database  exist: 
an  up-to-date  commercial  version  and  an  older  public 
version-both  of  them  provide  comprehensive  mutation 
information.  The  total  number  of  public  entries  that  are 
available  to  users  from  academic  institutions  or  non-
profit  organizations  is  61,447,  comprising  35,168  mis-
sense  or  nonsense  mutations,  10,035  small  deletions, 

and  5805  splicing  mutations.  Because  data  are  col-
lected  by  a  combination  of  manual  and  computerized 
searches,  the  contents  are  considered  highly  reliable. 
GMDBs,  such  as  OMIM  and  HGMD,  have  several  limi-
tations,  however,  most  of  which  are  attributable  to 
less-specialized  knowledge  of  particular  genetic  loci 
(Porter  et al.,  2000).

LSDB  and  Swiss-Prot

LSDBs  are  usually  maintained  by  experts  on  a  particular 
gene  or  locus,  provide  a  greater  depth  of  information 
about  each  variation,  and  often  present  unpublished  da-
ta  that  are  submitted  directly  by  researchers  in  related 
fields.  In  contrast,  LSDBs  can  often  become  stagnant  or 
disappear  because  they  are  likely  to  depend  on  limited 
funding  resources  and  part-time  scientists  (Porter et al., 
2000).  Hundreds  of  LSDBs  for  718  genes  are  currently 
listed  on  the  website  of  the  Human  Genome  Variation 
Society  (HGVS).  The  Swiss-Prot  database  (release  ver-
sion  56.4),  with  46,799  CVs  for  9085  proteins,  comple-
ments  LSDBs.  These  CVs  are  particularly  useful  for  de-
veloping  prediction  algorithms  of  functionality  (Care  et 
al.,  2007),  because  Swiss-Prot  provides  a  well-summar-
ized  list  of  CVs  with  corresponding  protein  identi-
fications,  sequence  positions,  amino  acid  changes,  and 
disease  associations  (disease  vs.  polymorphism).

dbSNP

NCBIâ€™s  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  database 
(dbSNP,  build  129)  contains  14.7  million  human  refer-
ence  SNPs.  Their  broad  collection  of  simple  genetic 
polymorphisms  includes  SNPs,  small-scale  multibase 
deletions  or  insertions,  retrotransposable  element  in-
sertions,  and  microsatellite  repeat  variations  (Sherry  et 
al.,  2001).  The  database  provides  the  frequency  of  the 
polymorphism  by  population  or  individual,  allowing  for 
estimates  of  prevalence  in  a  specific  population.  The 
database  archives  variations  regardless  of  their  clinical 
associations  and  contains  some  clinically  associated 
SNPs  that  are  linked  to  OMIM,  LSDB,  or  the  clinical 
laboratory.  It  should  be  noted  that  SNPs  that  lack  clin-
ical  associations  and  have  not  been  functionally  vali-
dated  may  still  be  relevant.

dbGaP

The  database  of  genotype  and  phenotype  (dbGaP)  ar-
chives  the  results  of  studies  that  investigate  the  inter-
action  between  genotype  and  phenotype  (Mailman  et 
al.,  2007).  The  database  includes  SNPs  that  affect  both 
clinical  and  nonclinical  phenotypes  that  are  found  in  ge-
nome-wide  association  studies,  medical  sequencing, 
and  molecular  diagnostic  assays.  The  results  are  cate-
gorized  by  study  and  by  disease.  More  than  30  studies 
are  listed,  each  comprising  thousands  of  case-control 
sets  or  parent-offspring  trios.  Authorized  users  can 
download  individual-level  data  for  their  own  research.

HapMap

The  haplotype  map  (HapMap)  (release  #24)  contains  the 
genotypes  and  frequencies  of  over  3.8  million  SNPs. 
The  SNPs  were  obtained  by  analyzing  DNA  samples 
from  270  individuals,  comprising  30  trios  of  two  parents 
and  an  adult  child  of  African  ancestry,  30  trios  of 
European  ancestry,  and  90  unrelated  individuals  of 
Asian  ancestry  (Frazer  et al.,  2007).  Because  the  in-
dividuals  were  randomly  selected,  one  would  expect 
that  very  few  variations  in  HapMap  are  functionally  dele-
terious;  therefore,  HapMap  data  could  be  used  as  a  ref-
erence  set  of  neutral  CVs.
    In  conclusion,  the  OMIM,  HGMD,  and  LSDB  data-
bases  catalog  known  deleterious  mutations  that  result  in 
severe  disease,  while  the  Swiss-Prot  and  dbGaP  data-
bases  record  those  that  have  modest  effects  on  the  re-
sulting  protein.  The  Swiss-Prot,  dbSNP,  and  HapMap 
databases  provide  fundamental  information  on  neutral 
polymorphisms.

Prediction  Programs  for  Functional  As-
sessment  of  Sequence  Variations

Because  it  was  shown  that  protein  structure  and  se-
quence-based  attributes  could  provide  information  to 
distinguish  deleterious  mutations 
from  neutral  sin-
gle-base  changes  (Sunyaev et al.,  2000;  Chasman et al., 
2001),  many  prediction  programs  have  been  developed 
and  implemented  on  a  web  server  to  provide  in silico 
prediction  of  CV  functionality  (Ng  et al.,  2006;  Care  et 
al.,  2007).  These  programs  employ  a  variety  of  rule- 
based  models  and  machine  learning  algorithms,  using 
information  on  protein  structure,  sequence,  phys-
icochemical  properties,  phylogenetics,  and  evolutionary 
features.  The  widely  used  programs  are  listed  below 
and  summarized  in  Table  2.

SIFT  and  PolyPhen

The  program  Sorting  Intolerant  From  Tolerant  (SIFT) 
uses  sequence  homology  to  calculate  a  scaled  proba-
bility  for  the  substitution  that  is  observed  (Ng  et al., 
2001;  Ng  et al.,  2002;  Ng  et al.,  2003).  Substitutions 
that  have  a  low  scaled  probability  are  predicted  to  af-
fect  protein  function.  The  Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL  databases 
and  PSI-BLAST  were  used  for  sequence  alignment.  As 
the  first  program  that  was  implemented  on  a  web  serv-
er,  SIFT  is  one  of  the  most  frequently  used,  along  with 
Polymorphism  Phenotyping  (PolyPhen)  (Sunyaev  et al., 
2001;  Ramensky et al.,  2002).  PolyPhen  uses  empirically 
derived  rules  to  predict  the  effect  of  CVs  on  protein 
function.  The  rules  are  based  on  known  protein  struc-
tures,  sequence  conservation  between  homologous  pro-
teins,  and  sequence-based  characterization  of  the  sub-
stitution  site  (e.g.,  binds  lipid,  metal).  These  two  pro-
grams  are  among  the  earliest  developed  programs  and 
have  been  recently  updated.

MSRV

A  method  that  was  published  by  Jiang  et al.  adopts 
Multiple  Selection  Rule  Voting  (MSRV),  which  includes 
three  physicochemical  properties  (molecular  weight,  pI 
value,  and  hydrophobicity  scale)  of  amino  acids,  three 
relative  frequencies  for  the  presence  of  amino  acids  in 
secondary  structures  (helices,  strands,  and  turns),  and 
two  evolutionary  conservation  scores  (Jiang  et  al., 
2007).  These  authors  compared  the  areas  under  the  re-
ceiver  operating  curves  (AUCs)  of  MSRV,  SIFT,  and 
PolyPhen  and  showed  that  MSRV  employs  optimal  fea-
ture  sets,  outperforming  SIFT  and  PolyPhen  in  prioritiz-
ing  disease  mutations  that  are  responsible  for  mono-
genic  and  polygenic  diseases.

â€ Performance  was  summarized  based  on  the  literature  in  which  the  method  was  introduced.  False  negative  (FN)  error  rate 
is  the  percentage  of  the  deleterious  variations  predicted  to  be  neutral.  False  positive  (FP)  error  rate  is  the  percentage  of  the 
neutral  variations  predicted  to  be  deleterious.  Area  under  the  receiver  operating  characteristic  curve  (AUC)  was  calculated  in 
the  Jiang  et al.  study  (Jiang  et al.,  2007).

PANTHER

function  by 

to 

relating  sequence 

The  program  PANTHER  can  predict  the  effect  of  CVs  on 
protein 
function 
(Thomas et al.,  2003;  Thomas et al.,  2004).  The  program 
uses  a  hidden  Markov  model  and  a  library  of  protein 
families  to  score  the  functional  likelihood  of  different 
amino  acid  substitutions.  The  phenotypic  effect  is  de-
termined  by 
the  position-specific  evolutionary  con-
servation  (PSEC)  scores  that  are  obtained  from  the 
model.  Because  the  source  codes  for  the  PANTHER  pre-
dictor  and  the  PANTHER  library  are  available  online,  this 
method  is  useful  for  analyzing  a  large  number  of  CVs.

SNAP  and  PMUT

Screening  for  Non-Acceptable  Polymorphisms  (SNAP) 

(NNs) 

predicts  non-neutral  substitutions  by  using  annotations 
from  the  protein  mutant  database  (Kawabata  et al., 
1999)  and  by  combining  many  sequence  analysis  tools 
(Bromberg  et  al.,  2007; 
in  neural  networks 
Bromberg et al.,  2008a;  Bromberg et al.,  2008b).  It  also 
uses  solvent  accessibility,  secondary  structure,  flexibility, 
SIFT  results,  and  conservation  information.  SNAP  gives 
a  reliability  index  of  the  prediction,  ranging  from  0  (low) 
to  9  (high  reliability).  PMUT  is  similar  to  SNAP  with  re-
gard  to  its  methods  and  output.  PMUT  is  also  based  on 
the  use  of  two  NNs  that  are  trained  with  human  muta-
tion  data  (Ferrer-Costa et al.,  2002;  Ferrer-Costa et al., 
2004;  Ferrer-Costa et al.,  2005).  It  displays  a  pathoge-
nicity  index  that  ranges  from  0  to  1  (ï¼ž0.5  signals 
pathological  mutations),  a  confidence  index  that  ranges 
from  0  (low)  to  9  (high  confidence),  and  the  mutation 
site  on  the  protein  structure  to  trace  its  pathogenicity.

nsSNPAnalyzer

The  program  nsSNPAnalyzer  uses  a  machine  learning 
algorithm  called  random  forest  to  combine  heteroge-
neous  sources  of  predictors  (Bao  et al.,  2005;  Bao  et 
al.,  2005).  Random  forest  was  trained  with  various  fea-
tures,  such  as  structural  information,  sequence  con-
servation,  and  SIFT  prediction  using  a  dataset  from 
Swiss-Prot.  The  source  codes  of  nsSNPAnalyzer  are  al-
so  available  on  the  website.
    As  reviewed  in  this  section,  many  programs  use  com-
mon  sources  and  methods  while  exploiting  different  al-
gorithms,  features,  and  databases.  Combined  use  of 
these in silico  programs  is  encouraged  to  mitigate  their 
limitations  in  prediction  performance.  Source  codes  are 
necessary  to  analyze  large-scale  data  with  several  pro-
grams;  code  availability  is  summarized  in  Table  2.

Combination Approach to Predicting Func-
tion

Given  that  predictions  of  the  functional  consequences  of 
amino  acid  substitutions  can  be  more  accurate  by  com-
bining  different  in silico  methods  (Ng  et al.,  2006),  a 
combination  approach  has  been  proposed  to  improve 
prediction  accuracy  (Won  et al.,  2008).  To  assess  the 

Fig. 1.  Receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curves  of  in-
dividual  predictors  and  their  combinations.  The  ROC  curves 
of  SVM  combinations  tend  toward  the  upper  left  corner  of 
the  plot  more  than  the  three  individual  prediction  programs, 
indicating  superior  performance.  This  shows  that  the  appro-
priate  combination  can  noticeably  improve  prediction  accu-
racy.  Figure  from  Won  et al.,  2008.

effectiveness  of  this  approach,  the  prediction  perform-
ance  of  individual  programs  must  be  evaluated.  A  sup-
port  vector  machine  (SVM)  was  used  to  combine  three 
representative  in  silico  prediction  programs 
(SIFT, 
PolyPhen,  and  PANTHER)  to  predict  the  phenotypic  ef-
fects  of  CVs.
    Assuming  that  the  HapMap  dataset  comprises  mainly 
nonpathogenic  variations  (negative  samples)  while  the 
HGMD  dataset  comprises  pathogenic  variations  (positive 
samples),  we  compared  the  prediction  performances  of 
SVM  combinations  and  individual  predictors,  including 
SIFT,  PolyPhen,  and  PANTHER  (see  Won et al.,  2008  for 
details).  The  three  different  kernel  functions-a  linear  ker-
nel,  a  polynomial  kernel,  and  a  radial  basis  function  ker-
nel-were  used  to  train  SVMs.  The  experimental  results 
show  that  the  SVM  combinations  outperform  the  in-
dividual  prediction  programs 
(Fig.  1).  In  particular, 
SVMpolynomial  has  a  slightly  superior  predictive  value  than 
the  other  two  SVM  combinations.  PANTHER  outper-
forms  PolyPhen  and  SIFT  in  terms  of  sensitivity  over  all 
specificity 
regions.  The  superior  performance  of 
SVMpolynomial  indicates  that  the  appropriate  combination 
can  effectively  improve  prediction  accuracy.

Conclusion

Interpreting  the  functionality  of  newly  found  variations  in 
gene  coding  regions  is  of  much  importance  to  both  bio-
medical  research  and  clinical  practice.  The  first  step  to 
understanding  these  variations  is  to  examine  them  using 
valuable  resources,  such  as  variation  databases  and 
functional  prediction  programs.  Furthermore,  automated 
prediction  methods  are  essential  for  analyzing  CVs  on  a 
genome-wide  scale.  This  review  summarizes  representa-
tive  examples  of  useful  resources  and  emphasizes  the 
ongoing  need  for  improvement  in  the  performance  of  in-
dividual  prediction  methods.  We  suggest  that  compre-
hensive  analyses  that  use  a  combination  of  comple-
mentary  databases  and in silico  programs  are  necessary 
to  overcome  the  relative  weakness  of  each  program.  In 
the  case  of  SVM  combinations,  we  showed  that  pre-
diction  can  be  improved  effectively  if  the  results  of  the 
individual  programs  are  appropriately  combined.
