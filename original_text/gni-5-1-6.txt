Abstract 
An  RNase  P ribozyme  library has been  developed as a 
tool  for functional  genomics studies.  Each  clone  of this 
library contains  a random  1 B-mer and the  sequence  of 
M1  RNA, the catalytic subunit of RNase P.  Repression of 
target  gene  expression 
is  thus  achieved  by  the 
complementary  binding  of mRNA to  the  random  guide 
sequence  and  the  successive  target  cleavage  via  M1 
RNA.  Cellular  expression  of the  ribozyme  expression 
was confinned,  and  EGFP mRNA was used as a model 
to  demonstrate that the  RNase  P ribozyme  expression 
system  can  inhibit  the  target  gene  expression.  The 
constructed  RNase  P ribozyme library has a complexity 
of 1.4x107
.  This  novel  library system  should become  a 
useful  in  functional  genomics,  to  identify  novel  gene 
functions in  mammalian  cells.

Introduction 
Identification of novel gene functions is one of the major 
goals  of biology in  the  post-genome  era.  A  number of 
approaches have been developed to achieve rapid, high(cid:173)
throughput  gene  annotation  with  the  phenotype-based 
functional genomics approach using libraries of genome(cid:173)
regulating molecules being the most established. In  this 
strategy,  expression  of  each  component  of genome(cid:173)
regulating molecules from the library inhibits target gene 
expression, and the resulting phenotype is screened in a high(cid:173)
throughput manner. This strategy successfully identified

genes that are associated vvith  specific phenotypes such 
as tumorigenesis or metastasis (Begeret a/.,  2001; Lee et 
a/.,  2004; Li eta/., 2000; V\/elch eta/., 2000; Suyama eta/., 
2003;  Suyama eta/., 2004). To date,  phenotype- based 
functional  genomics  methods  have  utilized  libraries  of 
various genome-regulating biomolecules such  as artificial 
transcription factors, ribozymes, or small interfering RNAs 
(Lee eta/., 2003; Akashi eta/., 2005). 

Escherichia  coli  RNase  P  nucleoprotein  complex 
consists of a catalytic RNA subunit (M1  RNA) and a protein 
subunit  (C5  protein).  It is knovvn  that M1  RNA is solely 
responsible  for  the  catalytic  activity  of  the  ribozyme 
complex (Kole eta/., 1981 ). This catalytic activity of M1  RNA 
can  be used for targeted degradation  of RNAs in vivo.  It 
was  reported  that  the  expression  of hybrid  RNA  that 
consists  of  M1  RNA  and  a  guide  sequence  vvhich  is 
complementary to the target mRNA efficiently represses 
target gene expression. The hybrid RNA binds the cellular 
target mRNA via its guide sequence and the catalytic M1 
RNA cleaves the target. As a result, target specific gene 
expression  inhibition  is accomplished (Raj  eta/., 2003). 
However,  a  library-based  phenotypic  screening  based 
upon the  RNase  P ribozyme has not yet been  reported. 
In  this  study,  an  RNase  P  ribozyme  library  was 

constructed vvhich can  be utilized as a tool for phenotype(cid:173)
based functional  genomics studies  in  mammalian  cells. 
The ribozyme library harbors random 1 B-mers as the guide 
sequence. Therefore, vvhen  the library is introduced into 
the cell, the ribozyme RNA expressed from each clone of 
the  library binds  a target mRNA complementary to  the 
guide  sequence,  and  successive  mRNA cleavage  can 
occur. After phenotypic screening, the plasmid encoding 
the  ribozymes  responsible  for  the  phenotype  can  be 
retrieved  and  sequenced.  By  analyzing  the  nucleotide 
sequence  of the guide  sequence,  the identity of mRNA 
targeted by the ribozyme can  be revealed. 

Cons1ruction  of an  RNase  P  ribozyme 
expression system 
The first step to build an  RNase P-based ribozyme library 
was development of a vector system for RNase P ribozyme 
expression.  To  this  end,  a  plasmid  named pSUK4 was 
madevvhich can direct ribozyme synthesis in  mammalian 
cells. pSUK4 is derived from the pSUPER plasmid, a vector 
optimized for short RNA expression in  mammalian cells. It

screening  process,  especially  when  reporter  plasmid 
containing the ampicillin resistance marker is co-transfeded 
vvith the ribazymevector. The cloning strategy of the RNase 
P ribozyme unit is as follows.  First,  PCR was perfonned 
using an upstream primer induding the Bg/11  restriction site 
and the 5' end ofthe M1  RNA sequence and a davvnstream 
primer induding the 3'  end  of the spacer sequence,  the 
18-mer guide sequence, and the Sa/ I restriction site. We 
used M1 GS plasmid as a template which contains the M1 
RNA  coding  sequence  and  the  spacer  sequence  (5'(cid:173)
GAAGCTTGACCTGCAGGCATGCAAGCTTGGCGTAA 
TCATGGTCATAGCTGT  -3',  Trang  et  a/.,  2003).  (See 
below) Then the synthesized PCR product was clooed into 
the pSUK4 vector by using the Bg/11 and the Sa/1 enzyme. 
The  schematic  diagram  of the  constructed  RNase  P 
ribazyme expression vector is shown in  Fig.  1. 

Validation of RNase P ribozyrre expression 
system 
To validate efficient suppression of a target gene using our 
RNase P ribozyme expressioo system, we designed and 
tested  an  EGFP  (Enhanced  Green  Fluorescence 
Protein)-targeting RNase P ribazyme.  Rrst, we inspected 
the secondary structure of the EGFP mRNApredidedfran 
the  mFOLD  program,  and  chose  a  region  which  was

expected  to  be  the  most  accessible  (Fig  2A).  We  then 
designed  a  dovvnstream  primer  EGFPDN  (5'-CGCGC 
GGTCGACAAAAATGGTGCTACCCCGACCACATG 
AACAGCTATGACCATGATIACGCCAAGCTIGCAT-3'), 
vvflich contains a guide sequence that can bind the target 
region ofthe EGFP mRNA. Next, we perfonned PCR using 
the  M1UP  primer  (M1UP,  5'-CGCGCGAGA.TCTGA 
AGCTGA.CCAGACAGTCGC-3')  and 
the  EGFPDN 
primer, and the PCR product was inserted into pSUK4. The 
constructed  vector,  pS/M1-EGFP,  was  co-transfected 
with the  EGFP  expression vector into HEK293 cells. 48 
hours aftertransfection, total RNA was extracted using the 
Trizol  reagent  (Invitrogen).  The  expression  of the  M1-
EGFP RNA molecule was confinned by RT-PCR (Fig. 28), 
and the EGFP mRNA expression level was detennined by 
quantitative real-time PCR analysis. VVe observedthatthe 
expression of EGFP mRNA was reduced to -50% of the 
control experiment (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the pSUK4-based 
RNase P ribozyme expression system can repress target 
gene expression in mammalian  cells. 

Cons1ruction  of an  RNase  P  ribozyme 
library 
To construct an RNase P ribozyme library with randomized 
guide sequence, we  used  a primer set  of the upstream 
primer  M1UP  and  a  dovvnstream  primer  Rd18DN 
(5'-CGCGCGGTCGACAAAAATGGTNNNNNN NNNNN 
NNNNNNNACAGCTATGACCATGATIACG CAAGCTI 
GCAT-3'). The Rd18DN primer has a random 1 B-mer guide 
sequence instead of a specific sequence. After ligation of 
these  PCR  products with the  pSUK4 vector, the ligation 
nixturewas transformed into E co/ibyelectroporation. A total 
of about 1.4x 107 independent colonies was obtained, and 
plasmid  DNA  was  prepared  from  the  mixture  of these 
colonies. Finally, we checked the random 1 B-mer sequence 
from 15 randomly picked colonies and found no bias in the 
nucleotide composition  (Table 1 ). 

In  summary, we have developed a novel genomics tool 
that utilizes the catalytic subunit ofRNase P. In this system, 
the M1  RNA sequence and a random guide sequence are 
expressed as a single RNA molecule. Via the recognition 
of target mRNA by the random guide sequence followed 
by  mRNA  cleavage  by  the  catalytic  M1  RNA,  gene 
expression  is  blocked  in  a  sequence-specific  manner. 
Using EGFP mRNA as a model target, efficient target gene 
repression by RNase P ribozyme expression system was 
confinned.  Finally, we built an  RNase  P ribozyme library 
with  randomness  and  complexity suitable for functional 
genomics studies. This library system  should become a 
useful  addition  to  the  existing  libraries  for  genome
