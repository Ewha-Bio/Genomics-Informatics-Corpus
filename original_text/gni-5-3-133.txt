Abstract 
The  Gene  Set  network  viewer  (GSnet)  visualizes  the 
functional enrichment of a given gene set with a protein 
interaction network and is implemented as a plug-in for the 
Cytoscape platform. The functional enrichment of a given 
gene set is calculated using a hypergeometric test based 
on the Gene Ontology annotation. The protein interaction 
network is estimated  using  public data.  Set operations 
allow  a  complex  protein  interaction  network  to  be 
decomposed  into  a  functionally-enriched  module  of 
interest.  GSnet provides a new framework for gene set 
analysis by integrating a priori knowledge of a biological 
network with functional enrichment analysis.

High-throughput data from microarray experiments provide 
information about the expression of genes, with gene sets 
being defined based on the presence of coexpression in 
these experiments. Several methods have been proposed 
for  the  functional  analysis  of gene  sets,  including  the 
chi-square test, the hypergeometric test, and the Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Boyle eta/., 2004; Curtis et 
a/., 2005; Subramanian eta/., 2005). These methods find 
which given gene sets are significantly associated with a 
priori knowledge data, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) 
classification  (Ashburner  eta/.,  2000),  measure  the

statistical enrichment of genes in a gene set by calculating 
the p-value using a statistical method, and produce more 
robust  and  interpretable  information  from  microarray 
analyses (Bammler eta/., 2005). However, the current state(cid:173)
of-the-art  ontological  analysis  is  subject to  conceptual 
limitations (Khatri and Draghid, 2005), and the key regulators 
of a gene set can not be elucidated from expression profile 
alone. The proteinprotein interaction network is a type of 
scale-free architecture that follows a power-law distribution 
(Jeong  et a/.,  2001 ).  These  scale-free  networks  are 
characterized  by  the  existence  of  hubs  with  multiple 
interacting partners, with the genes in the hubs playing a 
functional key role in maintaining cell functions (Jeong et 
a/., 2001 ). It is important to understand the relationships and 
topology of gene expression in the complex hierarchical 
web of protein interactions (Jeong eta/., 2001; Nikolsky 
eta/., 2005; Rhodes and Chinnaiyan, 2005). Moreover, the 
presence of coexpression in multiple data sets is indicative 
of functional relatedness (Lee eta/., 2004), which implies 
that  hub  genes  in  functionally-clustered  modules  are 
functionally significant and worthy of investigation. However, 
to the best of our knowledge, there is no available tool that 
can  integrate the  functional  analyses  with  analyses  of 
proteinprotein  interaction networks.  The  Gene Set net(cid:173)
work viewer (GSnet)  has  been  designed to  provide  an 
analytical framework for integrating gene set enrichment 
analysis  with  the  analysis  of proteinprotein  interaction 
networks. GSnet characterizes and visualizes functional 
enrichment with the properties of an interaction network. 
It analyzes the GO term enrichment in a given gene set, 
and then constructs a proteinprotein interaction network 
of the gene set. Furthermore, set operations can be used 
in GSnet to select interesting genes included in a particular 
enriched GO term on the network graph in user-defined 
colors. Our approach facilitates the selection of putative 
target genes that have functional  importance in a given 
gene set. 

GSnet has been developed as a plug-in for Cytoscape, 
which is an open-source bioinformatics software platform 
for visualizing molecular interaction networks (available at 
http://www.cytoscape.org) (Shannon eta/., 2003). GSnet 
is freely available at http://www.kobic.re.kr/gsnet. GSnet 
takes a list or a file of Entrez Gene IDs or symbols, and also 
supports the  two-input-set  mode for the  analysis  of 
upregulated and downregulated gene sets. GSnet currently 
supports two protein-protein interaction databases for four 
species: human, mouse, rat, and yeast. These databases

are generated from the Biomolecular Interaction Network 
Database (Alfarano eta/., 2005) and the Agilent literature 
search  engine (Agilent Technologies,  2005 http://www. 
agilent.com/labs/research/mtl/projects/sysbio/sysinfor 
matics/litsearch.html)  using  PubMed  {Wheeler  et  a/., 
2005)  as  a  literature  reference.  For the  GO functional 
enrichment  analysis  of  the  gene  set,  we  adopted  a 
hypergeometric test (Tavazoie et al., 1999), which is one 
of the most widely-used methods. The hypergeometric test 
calculates the cumulative probability (p-value) of a given 
specific number of genes from a single gene set in a whole 
gene  list with  the  hypergeometric distribution.  For the 
correction of the significance of multiple testing, the false 
discovery rate (FDR) of the Benjamini-Hochberg method 
(Benjamini and Hochberg,  1995) is also calculated. GSnet 
provides options for filtering out some enriched functions, 
including the cut-off p-value, the number of genes within 
a GO term, and the levels of the GO-term hierarchy. The 
filtered  GO terms  are  then  categorized  into  molecular 
function, biological process, and cellular component. The 
categorized  results are displayed in  order of ascending 
p-value as a tabbed-table in a results window, with two such 
windows  being  shown  in  the  two-input-set  mode.  The 

proteinprotein  interaction  network  of  given  genes  is 
constructed simultaneously using the protein interaction 
database and visualized in Cytoscape. To customize the 
visualization  of  sub-networks  or  modules,  users  can 
highlight them by selecting the GO function of interest with 
a user-defined color. A set with more than onefunction of 
interest can  be  defined  by set operations,  which  allow 
users  to decompose the  network and  refine  functional 
modules of interest, as shown in Fig. 1. Set operations can 
be carried out among genes of GO terms in the same or 
different GO categories. The set of nodes is selected by 
checking the "Set A" or "Set B" checkbox beside a GO term, 
and the type of set operation is specified by marking the 
appropriate checkbox  in  the view-option.  The  selected 
nodes (i.e., proteins) can be further manipulated to create 
a child network or to merge them into another network using 
the  layout  functionality  supported  by  Cytoscape.  To 
identify the  hub genes in  a  given  network,  GSnet also 
provides the number of interacting partners of each gene 
as  a  new  attribute--the  number  of  edges.  Attribute 
information  is  shown  on  the  node  attribute  browser of 
Cytoscape. We briefly summarize some specific aspects 
of GSnet in Table 1.

GSnet is an integrated viewer for analyzing biological 
networks and the functional enrichment of gene sets. The 
integration of data derived from heterogeneous experimental 
sources may help to reduce the influence of noise inherent 
in experimental data. In addition, putative targets for further 
studies  can  be  estimated  by  targeting  the  hub  genes. 
GSnet can incorporate additional statistical models and 
databases as needed. We consider GSnet to be a valuable 
tool that provides a new analytical framework for expanding 
the interpretation of gene sets and biological networks.
