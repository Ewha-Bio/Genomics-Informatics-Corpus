Abstract

In  planning  a  model-based  phylogenic  study  for  highly 
related  ethnic  data,  the  SNP  marker  number  is  an  im-
portant  factor  to  determine  for  relationship  inferences. 
Genotype  frequency  data,  utilizing  a  sub  sampling  meth-
od,  from  63  Pan  Asian  ethnic  groups  was  used  for  de-
termining  the  minimum  SNP  number  required  to  estab-
lish  such  relationships.  Bootstrap  random  sub-samplings 
were  done  from  5.6K  PASNPi  SNP  data.  DA  distance 
was  calculated  and  neighbour-joining  trees  were  drawn 
with  every  re-sampling  data  set.  Consensus  trees  were 
made  with  the  same  100  sub-samples  and  bootstrap 
proportions  were  calculated.  The  tree  consistency  to  the 
one  obtained  from  the  whole  marker  set,  improved  with 
increasing  marker  numbers.  The  bootstrap  proportions 
became  reliable  when  more  than  7,000  SNPs  were  used 
at  a  time.  Within  highly  related  ethnic  groups,  the  mini-
mum  SNPs  number  for  a  robust  neighbor-joining  tree  in-
ference  was  about  7,000  for  a  95%  bootstrap  support.

Keywords:  neighbour-joining,  phylogeny,  minimum  SNP,

Introduction

Autosomal  Single  Nucleotide  Polymorphisms  (SNPs)  are 
now  widely  used  for  human  linkage  analyses  and  demo-
graphic  history  inferences  (Abdulla et al.,  2009;  Cavalli- 
Sforza  and  Feldman,  2003;  Collins et al.,  1997;  Li et al., 
2008;  Wang et al.,  1998).  Other  markers  such  as  Short 
Tandem  Repeat  (STR),  Y  chromosomal  variation,  and 
mitochondrial  variations  have  been  used  for  the  same 
purpose  widely  (Agrawal  and  Khan,  2005;  Karafet et al., 
2008;  Mountain  and  Cavalli-Sforza,  1997;  Torroni et al., 
2006).  SNPs  have  some  advantages  as  (a)  they  are 
highly  abundant  in  whole  human  genome  compared  to 
STR,  (b)  they  can  be  detected  with  high  efficiency  by 
genotyping,  and  (c)  they  are  preserved  over  generations 
compared  to  the  Y  chromosome  and  the  mitochondrial 
genome.
    In  phylogeny,  the  search  for  a  minimum  marker  num-
ber  has  a  long  history  (Felsenstein,  1988;  Lecointre  et 
al.,  1994;  Liu  and  Muse,  2005;  Zharkikh  and  Li,  1992a; 
Zharkikh  and  Li,  1992b).  Earlier  studies  have  mainly 
used  sequence  itself  over  species.  When  phylogeny  was 
used  as  a  tool  in  human  evolution  and  relationship  stu-
dy  between  ethnicities,  so  many  issues  surfaced:  genet-
ic  distance  calculation  method,  tree  drawing  method, 
and  marker  type  disputes  (Glover  et al.,  2010;  Lin  and 
Nei,  1991;  Nei,  1978a;  Nei,  1978b;  Nei  and  Roychoud-
hury,  1974;  Tateno et al.,  1994).  The  cause  of  these  ar-
guments  were  mainly  that  human  phylogeny  is  a  study 
of  micro-evolution.  Nowadays,  SNPs  are  being  utilized 
for  relationship  inferences  (Hinch et al.,  2011;  Li et al., 
2010;  Travis,  2009).  However,  the  elementary  question, 
regarding  the  minimum  marker  number  one  can  use  to 
establish  phylogeny-related  ethnicity  in  humans  remains 
unsolved. 
    In  the  phylogenic  analysis,  more  SNPs  give  more  in-
formation  contents,  and,  hence,  a  more  accurate  phylo-
genic  tree.  However,  when  sub-sets  of  SNPs  should  be 
tested  for  a  simulation  or  a  hypothesis,  there  should  be 
a  criteria  for  a  minimum  number  of  markers.  Further-
more,  for  cases  using  highly  related  sample  groups 
(ethnicities)  or  numerous  sample  groups  at  a  time,  the 
need  for  the  minimum  marker  number  becomes  larger. 
Here,  we  report  the  minimum  number  of  SNP  that  can 
be  used  for  a  robust  phylogenic  analysis  with  a  highly

related  63  Pan  Asian  ethnic  groups. 

Methods

Sample  data:  PASNPi  genotyping  data

The  63  ethnic  group  samples  were  selected  from  PA-
SNPi  genotyping  data  (Table  1).  PASNPi  data  were  ob-
tained  from  72  PASNP  ethnic  and  four  HapMap  groups. 
Samples  that  represent  72  ethnic  groups  in  Pan  Asia 
were  obtained  from  ten  Asian  countries  and  Affymetrix 
data  from  USA.  1,833  distinct  non-duplicated  individuals 
were  genotyped  with  the  Affymetrix  50K  Xba  chip  prob-
ing  58,960  SNPs.  The  data  included  HapMap  data, 
which  consists  of  209  individuals  representing  four  pop-
ulations  (http://www.hapmap.org/).  Common  markers  be-

tween  PASNPi  and  HapMap  data  were  56,025.  To  use 
the  56,025  common  marker  based  NJ  tree  as  a  com-
parison  reference  tree  in  the  simulation,  the  tree  robust-
ness  was  tested  1,000  times  with  72  ethnic  groups. 
During  the  test,  the  bootstrap  proportions  (BPs)  of  13 
ethnic  groups  were  not  robust  (lowest  BP  of  the  ex-
cluded  groups  was  44).  Because  those  13  groups  can 
adversely  influence  the  simulation,  they  were  filtered  out 
to  get  more  accurate  result.  Removed  ethnicities  were 
ID-KR,  ID-TB,  MY-MN,  SG-ML,  MY-KN,  ID-TR,  MY-JH, 
MY-TM,  MY-KS,  ID-SU,  ID-JA,  ID-JV,  and  MY-BD.

Phylogenic  analysis  and  simulation  test 

Sub-marker  sets  were  created  from  1,000  to  30,000 
SNP  markers  increasing  500  markers  at  each  time.  Each

The  ethnic  group  codes  consist  of  a  two-letter  country  code  followed  by  another  two-letter  ethnicity  code.  Country  codes  are  as  follows: 
[CN:  China],  [ID:  Indonesia],  [IN:  India],  [JP:  Japan],  [KR:  Korea],  [MY:  Malaysia],  [PI:  Philippine],  [SG:  Singapore],  [TH:  Thailand],  [TW: 
Taiwan],  [AX:  Affymetrix  (not  a  country)].  Four  HapMap  samples  are  as  follows:  [CHB:  Han  Chinese  in  Beijing,  China],  [CEU:  Americans  with 
northern  and  western  European  ancestry  in  Utah,  USA],  [JPT:  Japanese  in  Tokyo,  Japan],  and  [YRI:  Yoruba  in  Ibadan,  Nigeria].  The  sam-
pling  map  of  ethnicities  was  given  the  earlier  PASNPi  paper  (Abdulla  et al.,  2009).

sub-marker  set  was  sampled  100  times  randomly  from 
whole  56,025  SNPs  and  was  bootstrapped  100  times. 
Bootstrapping  was  restricted  100  times  because  of  the 
computational  load.  Phylogenic  trees  were  drawn  with  a 
neighbor-joining  method  (Saitou  and  Nei,  1987)  and  a 
consensus  tree  method,  Consense,  in  the  PHYLIP  pack-
age  (Felsenstein,  1989).  Genetic  distance  based  on  al-

lele  frequencies  of  SNPs  was  measured  with  Nei’s  DA 
distance  (Nei  et al.,  1983).  Takezaki  and  Nei  showed 
that  Nei’s  DA  and  Cavalli-sforza  and  Edwards’s  chord 
distance  were  more  appropriate  to  get  a  good  quality  of 
tree  topologies  (Takezaki  and  Nei,  1996).  We  used  the 
DA  distance  in  the  phylogenic  analysis.  Nei’s  DA  dis-
tance  between  population  X  and  population  Y  was  de-

the j-th  locus  in  populations  X  and  Y,  respectively, mj  is 
the  number  of  alleles  at  the j-th  locus,  and r  is  the  num-
ber  of  loci  examined. 
    In  the  simulation  test  for  the  minimum  SNP  number  re-
quired  for  a  robust  tree,  jackknife  and  bootstrap  re-sam-
pling  methods  were  executed  alternatively  (Lecointre  et 
al.,  1994).  As  a  similarity  measure  of  tree  robustness, 
bootstrap  support  (BS)  was  defined  by

Because  of  a  hard  computing  task  for  sub-sampling  and 
bootstrapping,  the  simulation  was  performed  on  a  Work-
flow-based  Genomic  Cyber  Computing  (GCC)  system 
that  is  the  main  computing  platform  controlled  by  com-
putationally  intensive  workflows  in  the  high  performance 
computing  environment  (Youn  et al.,  2011). 

Results

Tree  topology  accuracy  and  robustness

Five  representative  bootstrap  trees  from  each  100 
sub-sample  set  and  the  one  of  whole  56,025  SNPs 
were  expressed  in  Fig.  1.  The  whole  SNP  based-phylo-
genic  tree  of  63  Pan  Asian  ethnic  groups  had  a  stable 

topology  when  it  was  bootstrapped  100  times.  The  low-
est  BP  was  63  in  the  group  of  three  Thailand  ethnic 
groups  (TH-TK,  TH-TY,  and  TH-TL)  and  most  of  the  no-
des  had  100%  BPs.
    Compared  to  the  one  of  whole  SNPs,  tree  topologies 
from  1,000  SNPs  to  3,000  SNPs  were  not  consistent 
within  the  100  sub-sets  of  each  random  picking  number. 
Furthermore,  the  BPs  were  low  (the  lowest  one  was 
18%  in  Fig.  1B,  a  tree  of  1,000  SNPs)  and,  therefore, 
the  robustness  of  each  tree  was  not  supported.  When 
4,000  SNPs  were  used  in  the  analysis  (Fig.  1C),  the  BPs 
were  more  stable  than  earlier  ones  (the  lowest  one  was 
27%  in  the  joint  node  of  North  East  Asians).  However, 
they  were  not  comparable  with  the  one  using  whole 
SNP.  Additionally,  some  miss-groupings  were  observed 
at  the  same  time  (ID-DY  and  ID-ML,  PI-UI  and  PI-UN, 
IN-SP  and  IN-EL,  and  etc).  In  the  7,000  SNP  based 
tree,  the  topology  difference  to  the  whole  SNP-  based 
tree  was  very  low,  and  just  a  few  end  node  joint  prob-
lems  were  observed  (three  Japanese  ethnic  groups  (JP), 
the  location  of  PI-IR  and  CN-WA).  BPs  were  high  and 
the  tree  robustness  was  acceptable.  The  lowest  BP  was 
52%  in  the  joint  node  of  Indian  ethnicities  (INs)  and  that 
location  had  the  same  problem  in  the  whole  SNP  based 
tree  (BP  was  69%).

BP  increased  according  to  SNP  number 

Within  the  100  random  picking  sub-samples  of  the  same 
SNP  number,  there  was  some  difference  in  values. 
Especially,  the  small  number  of  SNPs  (＜3,000  SNPs) 
resulted  in  higher  variability  of  BPs,  and  hence,  low  ro-
bustness.  With  the  increase  of  an  analysed  SNP  num-
ber,  the  tree  robustness  was  improved  (Fig.  2).  The 
mean  of  BP  within  100  sub-sample  sets  were  charted  in 

Fig.  2.  Bootstrap  support  (BS)  relative  to  each  SNP  num-
ber.  BSs  calculated  with  each  100  sub-sample  set  are  on 
the  Y  axis.  Sub-samplings  of  SNPs  were  done  randomly 
from  1,000  SNPs  to  30,000  SNP.

er  numbers  of  each  distance  (X  axis)  are  on  Y  axis.

the  Fig.  2.  The  BPs  with  more  than  7,000  SNPs  were 
similar  to  the  ones  of  whole  SNP  based  tree  (BS  was 
more  than  95%). 

Discussion 

If  SNPs  in  a  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  bin  or  a  same 
haplotype  block  are  used  in  a  phylogenic  analysis,  the 
genetic  distance  and  the  resulting  tree  can  be  biased  to 
the  related  SNPs.  Thus,  the  tree  could  be  representing 
some  partial  markers  that  do  not  reflect  the  genome- 
wide  relationship  pattern.  In  a  2002  study  of  Gabriel  and 
his  colleagues,  it  was  known  that  about  90%  of  LD  bins 
span  within  100kb  in  Asian  human  genome  (Gabriel  et 
al.,  2002).  About  50,000  SNPs  in  the  Affymetrix  50K 
chip  had  the  proximity  problem  (Fig.  3).  However,  since 
the  strategy  of  Affymetrix  marker  selection  reflects  tag 
SNPs,  most  of  the  genotyped  markers  were  not  in  one 
bin  or  block  (Matsuzaki  et al.,  2004;  Nicolae  et al., 
2006).  Furthermore,  there  were  63  ethnic  groups  in-
volved  in  the  analysis  and  they  had  somewhat  different 
genomic  structures  within  them  that  are  not  known  yet. 
Thus,  concrete  bins  or  blocks  common  within  63  eth-
nicities  were  not  identifiable. 
    Most  of  the  current  human  relationship  studies  use  a 
genome-wide  SNP  chips  (Hinch  et al.,  2011;  Li  et al., 
2010;  Travis,  2009).  The  small  number  of  markers  has 
worked  well  within  highly  different  ethnic  groups 
(Agrawal  and  Khan,  2005;  Cavalli-Sforza  and  Feldman, 
2003;  Mountain  and  Cavalli-Sforza,  1997).  When  highly 
related  ethnicities  or  a  number  of  ethnicities  are  consid-
ered  in  a  study,  a  larger  marker  numbers  will  be  a  good 
strategy.  However,  when  a  bulk  of  markers  was  used, 
there  would  be  an  inevitable  problem  of  proximity  be-
tween  markers,  which  can  cause  a  bias  to  some  specif-
ic  haplotype  blocks  or  LD  bins.  As  an  alternative  meth-
od,  based  on  informative  marker  sets  were  studied 
(Jung et al.,  2010;  Liu  and  Muse,  2005).  However,  those 
informative  marker  sets  could  be  less  useful  when  they 
are  used  with  another  third  ethnic  group,  which  was  not 
considered  during  the  marker  design  itself.  Thus,  ran-
dom  marker  could  be  more  informative  within  numerous 
ethnicities.
