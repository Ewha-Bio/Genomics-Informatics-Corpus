Regulation and Function 

of the Peg3 Imprinted Domain

A subset of mammalian genes differ functionally between two alleles due to genomic imprinting, and seven such genes 
(Peg3, Usp29, APeg3, Zfp264, Zim1, Zim2, Zim3) are localized within the 500-kb genomic interval of the human and mouse 
genomes,  constituting  the  Peg3  imprinted  domain.  This  Peg3  domain  shares  several  features  with  the  other  imprinted 
domains, including an evolutionarily conserved domain structure, along with transcriptional co-regulation through shared 
cis regulatory elements, as well as functional roles in controlling fetal growth rates and maternal-caring behaviors. The Peg3 
domain also displays some unique features, including YY1-mediated regulation of transcription and imprinting; conversion 
and adaptation of several protein-coding members as ncRNA genes during evolution; and its close connection to human 
cancers through the potential tumor suppressor functions of Peg3 and Usp29. In this review, we summarize and discuss these 
features of the Peg3 domain.

Introduction

In  mammals,  a  small  subset  of  autosomal  genes  are 
functionally  different  between  two  alleles  due  to  an 
epigenetic mechanism, termed genomic imprinting [1, 2]. 
The number of imprinted genes is estimated to be 100－200 
per mammalian genome. These genes are usually clustered 
in specific chromosomal regions; thus, several genes from a 
given genomic interval are imprinted together as a group. 
Each imprinted domain, harboring 5 to 10 members, spans a 
relatively  large  genomic  interval,  ranging  from  a  few 
hundred kilobases to megabases in length [3]. The genomic 
structure of a given domain, such as gene content, order, and 
distance, is well conserved between different mammalian 
lineages.  The  evolutionary  constraint  maintaining  this 
domain  structure  is  likely  related  to  the  fact  that  the 
imprinted genes within one domain are usually co-regulated 
through  shared  cis  regulatory  elements.  These  regulatory 
regions are termed imprinting control regions (ICRs) [4]. 
Several ICRs have been identified from individual domains 
by a series of human and mouse genetic studies in the past 20 
years.  Genetic  and  molecular  studies  investigating  these 

ICRs,  particularly  the  ICR  of  the  H19/Igf2  domain,  have 
been  very  insightful  with  regard  to  our  understanding  of 
epigenetics, as well as long-distance transcriptional control 
mechanisms in humans and mice [2].

Paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3) is one of the imprinted 
genes that were discovered 20 years ago through subtractive 
pooling schemes of mRNA between paternal and maternal 
disomic embryos [5]. An independent study also discovered 
Peg3 as an important gene for muscle development; it was 
thus  named  Pw1  [6].  Shortly  after  these  simultaneous 
discoveries  of mouse  Peg3, the  human homolog  was also 
identified as one of the zinc finger genes located in human 
chromosome  19q13.4  [7].  Since  then,  six  additional  im-
printed genes have been identified from the 500-kb genomic 
interval surrounding the Peg3 locus, confirming the presence 
of an imprinted domain in the human and mouse genomes; 
it was thus named the Peg3 imprinted domain. A series of 
follow-up investigations have been conducted to character-
ize the genomic structures and regulatory mechanisms, as 
well as the functions of individual genes located within the 
Peg3 imprinted domain. In this short review, we intend to 1) 
summarize  the  information  that  we  have  learned  so  far 
regarding the Peg3 domain and 2) discuss the similarities

and  differences  between  the  Peg3  domain  and  other  im-
printed domains. 

Evolutionarily Conserved Genomic Structure

The 500-kb genomic interval of the Peg3 domain harbors 
seven  imprinted  genes:  paternally  expressed  Peg3;  Usp29 
(ubiquitin-specific hydrolase 29); APeg3 (antisense Peg3); 
Zfp264 (zinc finger protein 264); and maternally expressed 
Zim1 (zinc finger gene, imprinted 1), Zim2, and Zim3 (Fig. 1) 
[8-12].  All  of  these  imprinted  genes,  except  Zim1,  are 
conserved  among  individual  mammalian  species.  Zim1, 
however, is found only in mammals with large litter sizes, 
such as rodents and canines [13]. The order, spacing, and 
orientation of these imprinted genes are also well conserved 
between different mammalian species. This is quite unusual, 
since the Peg3 domain itself is part of a large zinc finger gene 
family  cluster,  which  is  known  to  go  through  dynamic 
genomic  changes  during  evolution.  This  is  even  more

The 500-kb genomic interval of the Peg3 domain is shown using 
the  mouse  genomic  region  as  a  representative  locus,  along  with
its  relative  position  in  mouse  chromosome  7  (Mmu7).  The  pater-
nally expressed and maternally expressed genes are indicated with
blue  and  red  arrows,  respectively.  The  three  differentially  methy-
lated regions (DMRs) are indicated with grey boxes. The 20 evo-
lutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) are shown with vertical blue 
lines,  except  ECR18  in  red.  The  graph  in  the  middle  represents
the sequence conservation levels of the Peg3 domain among pla-
cental  mammals.  The  table  below  summarizes  the  evolutionary 
conservation of gene content and their open reading frames (ORFs)
with  different  colors:  black  for  conserved  and  green  for  non- 
conserved.  The  first  two  exons  of  mouse  Usp29  were  previously
named ossification center-associated transcript (Ocat), while those
in humans and cow are named MER1 repeat-containing imprinted 
transcript  1  (MIMT1).  aThe  ORF  indicates  the  loss  of  the  USP29

evident in the genomic regions immediately surrounding the 
Peg3  domain,  which  are  occupied  by  two  gene  families: 
olfactory receptor and vomeronasal organ receptor. These 
two gene families show many more frequent lineage-specific 
expansions  and  deletions  during  mammalian  evolution, 
resulting  in  quite  different  structures  between  different 
species [14]. The changes observed from the surrounding 
genomic  regions  are  in  stark  contrast  to  the  structural 
conservation observed in the Peg3 domain.

Within the 500-kb region of the Peg3 domain, the seven 
imprinted genes are unevenly distributed: three genes are 
clustered together on one side, and the remaining four genes 
are on the other side (Fig. 1). By contrast, the middle 250-kb 
region  is  more  or  less  empty,  lacking  any  obvious  open 
reading frame (ORF). Yet, this overall genomic layout is well 
conserved among all mammals [8]. According to the results 
from a sequence comparison of several mammalian species, 
this middle 250-kb region is filled with 20 small genomic 
fragments, ranging from 100－300 bp in length, that show 
high levels of sequence conservation between species. These 
regions, termed evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs), 
are likely cis regulatory elements that may be involved in 
controlling  the  transcription  and  imprinting  of  the  Peg3 
domain [15]. This prediction has been recently confirmed 
through  the  epigenomic  results  in  which  the  majority  of 
these ECRs is associated with two histone modifications, 
H3K4me1 and H3K27ac (monomethylation of lysine 4 and 
acetylation  of  lysine  27,  respectively,  of  histone  3)  [16], 
which  are  closely  associated  with  enhancers  [17].  The 
relative  positions,  spacing,  and  orientations  of  these 
potential  cis  regulatory  elements  are  also  well  conserved 
among  all  mammals.  This  large  number  of  potential  cis 
regulatory elements within the 250-kb region hints at one 
possibility that unknown, but complex, regulatory mecha-
nisms exist to control transcription and imprinting of the 
Peg3 domain. 

Although the 500-kb domain has been structurally well 
preserved during mammalian evolution, the protein-coding 
capacity of each imprinted gene has been quite often lost 
independently in the different lineages of mammals (Fig. 1). 
For  example,  three  zinc  finger  genes,  Zim2,  Zim3,  and 
Zfp264, all have lost their ORFs in the rodent lineage [9, 10]. 
The  current  sequences  of  these  genes  in  rodents  have 
diverged substantially from their original coding sequences, 
so  that  they  are  barely  recognizable  as  zinc  finger  genes. 
Thus, these genes may have lost their ORFs quite a long time 
ago, at the early stages of rodent evolution. Nevertheless, 
they are still transcriptionally active, indicating that these 
genes might have functionally adapted as non-coding RNA 
genes.  In  fact,  one  of  these  genes,  Zim3,  has  become  an 
antisense  gene  to  Usp29:  the  transcribed  regions  overlap

quite extensively between maternally expressed Zim3 and 
paternally expressed Usp29. Usp29 also has taken a similar 
evolutionary path as seen in the three zinc finger genes. In 
the bovine lineage, the overall sequence structure of Usp29 is 
still intact, without any major deletions and insertions, but it 
contains several base substitutions causing STOP codons, 
indicating that these substitutions likely occurred in recent 
evolutionary times in the bovine lineage [13]. Interestingly, 
a similar situation has also been observed in one human 
population: one substitution causing a STOP codon has been 
found within the coding region of USP29 (http://browser. 
1000genomes.org/index.html). So far, Peg3 is the only gene 
that has maintained its ORF in all lineages of mammals, 
while  the  other  imprinted  genes  have  lost  ORFs  in  the 
different  lineages  of  mammals.  This  suggests  that  the 
functions of Peg3 might be the most critical for the survival of 
mammals as a protein-coding gene. On the other hand, the 
other members of the Peg3 domain might be less critical for 
the survival of mammals, which subsequently allows them 
to  have  adapted  as  ncRNA  genes  during  mammalian 
evolution. 

Co-regulation of Transcription and Imprinting

The transcription of the Peg3 domain is regulated through 
at  least  five  promoters:  two  bidirectional  promoters  for 
Peg3/Usp29 and Zim3/Zfp264 and three individual promoters 
for APeg3, Zim1, and Zim2. Among these promoter regions, 
three  regions  are  differentially  methylated  between  two 
alleles;  thus  they  are  named  differentially  methylated 
regions (DMRs). These include the DMRs of Peg3, Zim2, and 
Zim3 (Fig. 1). According to previous studies, the PEG3-DMR 
is a gametic DMR, such that its allele-specific methylation is 
established during gametogenesis in parents−in this case, 
the maternal-specific methylation during oogenesis [18]. In 
contrast, the DMRs of Zim2 and Zim3 are established after 
fertilization and are thus categorized as somatic DMRs [19]. 
The promoter of Zim1, on the other hand, is not methylated 
at all on either allele, whereas the methylation status of the 
APeg3  promoter  is  currently  unknown.  Among  the  three 
DMRs, the Peg3-DMR is the most critical for transcription 
and imprinting of the Peg3 domain. Deletion of part of this 
DMR causes changes in the transcriptional levels of all genes 
in  this  domain  [20].  The  same  mutation  also  affects  the 
monoallelic expression (imprinting) pattern of two genes, 
Zfp264  and  Zim2:  a  switch  from  paternal-  to  maternal- 
specific expression for Zfp264 and a change from maternal to 
biallelic expression for Zim2. These results demonstrate that 
the Peg3-DMR is an ICR for this domain. It is, however, 
currently  unknown  how  the  Peg3-DMR  obtains  DNA 
methylation  during  oogenesis  and  how  the  Peg3-DMR 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

serves as a major cis regulatory region governing the overall 
transcription of the Peg3 domain. 

The  4.0-kb  Peg3-DMR  can  be  divided  into  two  small 
regions:  the  first  1.5-kb  region  harbors  the  bidirectional 
promoter and the first exon for both Peg3 and Usp29, and the 
second  2.5-kb  region  covers  the  first  intron  of  Peg3.  The 
2.5-kb  intron  region  displays  an  unusual  tandem  repeat 
sequence structure, and one small motif (GGCGCCATCTT) 
within these repeats turns out to be a DNA-binding site for 
the transcription factor YY1 [21, 22]. Since this YY1-binding 
motif is part of the tandem repeats, multiple YY1 binding 
sites, 10 sites on average, are easily found within the 2.5-kb 
region of the Peg3-DMR for any given mammal [23]. A series 
of studies have been conducted to understand the potential 
roles  for  YY1  in  the  function  of  the  Peg3-DMR.  First, 
according  to  the  results,  conditional  knockdown  of  YY1 
during  oogenesis  results  in  hypomethylation  of  the 
Peg3-DMR, suggesting that the protein level of YY1 is very 
critical  for  the  establishment  of  DNA  methylation  in  the 
Peg3-DMR [24]. A similar outcome has also been observed 
in somatic cells using in vivo and in vitro systems [25, 26]. 
Thus, YY1 is likely to be involved in setting DNA methy-
lation  and  also  in  the  maintenance  of  the  Peg3-DMR. 
Second,  the  expression  of Peg3  is  usually  up-regulated  in 
response to the reduced levels of YY1 protein. This suggests 
that YY1 may function as a repressor of the transcription of 
Peg3 in somatic cells. This outcome is usually accompanied 
by global changes in the expression levels of other imprinted 
genes in the Peg3 domain, confirming a major role played by 
YY1 in the entire Peg3 domain [26]. Collectively, the results 
obtained so far confirm that YY1 is a major regulator of the 
Peg3 domain, possibly through the Peg3-DMR.

Along with the five promoters, the 20 ECRs located in the 
middle 250-kb region are also predicted to be involved in the 
transcriptional control of the Peg3 domain. To further follow 
up on this prediction, a series of 3C (chromosome confor-
mation capture) experiments were conducted using various 
adult  tissues  harvested  from  mouse  [15].  The  results 
revealed that one of these ECRs interacts with the bidirec-
tional promoter of Peg3/Usp29. This particular one, ECR18, 
is located 200 kb upstream of the bidirectional promoter, 
which  is  actually  positioned  closer  to  the  bidirectional 
promoter  of  Zim3/Zfp264.  The  interaction  is  the  most 
prominent in the brain but is also detected in other tissues, 
such  as  testis  and  liver.  As  described  earlier,  ECR18  is 
associated with two histone modifications, H3K4me1 and 
H3K27ac, which mark active enhancers. Subsequent in vitro 
promoter assays indeed demonstrated that ECR18 functions 
as an enhancer for the promoter of Peg3/Usp29 in several cell 
lines  tested.  The  3C  experiments  further  indicated  that 
ECR18 also interacts with the other promoters of the Peg3

Fig.  2.  Transcription  and  imprinting  control  of  the  Peg3  domain. 
The  schematic  representation  illustrates  a  potential  mode  of  the 
Peg3-DMR  and  ECR18  in  the  co-regulation  and  mono-allelic 
expression  (imprinting)  of  four  genes  in  the  mouse  brain:  the 
paternally expressed Peg3 and Usp29 and the maternally expressed
Zim1  and  Zim2.  On  the  paternal  allele,  the  Peg3-DMR  becomes 
a dominant user for the shared enhancer ECR18 and out-competes
the remaining two genes, Zim1 and Zim2. Thus, Peg3 and Usp29 
are  expressed  from  the  paternal  allele,  while  Zim1  and  Zim2 
become  silent  on  the  paternal  allele.  On  the  maternal  allele,  the 
Peg3-DMR is methylated, thus causing the repression of both  Peg3
and Usp29. As a consequence, the two genes Zim1 and Zim2 can
access ECR18 and be expressed from the maternal allele. However,
the  current  model  cannot  explain  the  imprinting  of  the  three 
remaining  genes,  APeg3,  Zim3  and  Zfp264,  since  some  of  these 
genes  are  expressed  mainly  in  testis  but  not  in  brain.

domain. In particular, the bidirectional promoter of Zim3/ 
Zfp264 and the promoter of Zim2 were shown to interact 
with ECR18 in the testis. Thus, ECR18 might be a shared 
enhancer for several genes in the Peg3 domain, not just for 
Peg3 and Usp29. 

The transcription and imprinting of the Peg3 domain is 
likely to be co-regulated through the Peg3-DMR, given the 
observations described above, such as global changes in the 
expression levels of the Peg3 domain either by targeting of 
the  Peg3-DMR  or  by  targeting  of  the  transcription  factor 
YY1. This predicted mechanism might be explained in the 
following  manner,  which  involves  ECR18  as  a  shared 
enhancer for the Peg3 domain (Fig. 2). On the paternal allele, 
the Peg3-DMR is unmethylated, and functions as a dominant 
promoter for both Peg3 and Usp29, thus outcompeting the 
promoters of the remaining genes, Zim1 and Zim2, for usage 
of the shared enhancer ECR18. On the maternal allele, the 
Peg3-DMR is methylated and silent, so that the promoters of 
Zim1 and Zim2 can access ECR18 for their transcription. This 
results in the paternal expression of Peg3 and Usp29 and the 
maternal expression of Zim1 and Zim2. This is particularly 
true in the brain, as strict imprinting and transcription of 
these four genes are usually observed in the neonatal brain. 

On the other hand, the imprinting and transcription of the 
remaining genes are either bi-allelic or not detectable in the 
brain;  thus,  the  proposed  model  is  more  applicable  for 
explaining the imprinting of the four genes in the brain. This 
model could explain some of the effects observed from the 
deletion  mutant  of  the  Peg3-DMR,  showing  bi-allelic 
expression  of  Zim2  in  carriers  inheriting  the  mutation 
paternally  [20].  Deletion  of  part  of  the  Peg3-DMR,  the 
2.5-kb YY1-binding sites, is likely to be responsible for the 
down-regulation of Peg3 expression and subsequently allows 
the access of Zim2 to the shared enhancer ECR18 on the 
paternal allele, resulting in the bi-allelic expression of Zim2. 
Although reasonable, this model needs to be revised with 
additional data in the near future in order to explain many 
aspects  of  the  imprinting  and  transcription  of  the  Peg3 
domain that cannot be explained at the moment. 

Functions of Imprinted Genes

At  the  organismal  level,  mammalian  imprinted  genes 
usually have similar functions, controlling fetal growth rates 
and nurturing behaviors [27, 28]. This is likely the case for 
the imprinted genes located within the Peg3 domain, based 
on the following lines of evidence. First, most genes in the 
Peg3 domain are expressed in early embryogenesis and the 
brain. The expression levels of Peg3 and Zim1 are very high in 
embryos and placenta [5, 11]. In brain, Peg3, Zim1, Zim2, and 
APeg3 are all expressed in the hypothalamus [29, 30], which 
is  known  to  be  involved  in  controlling  maternal-caring 
behaviors and milk provision [31]. Second, mutations in the 
Peg3 locus tend to have two consistent phenotypic effects 
[29,  32].  The  pups  with  mutant  alleles  have  defects  in 
milk-suckling  behaviors.  As  a  consequence,  the  carriers 
become progressively weaker than their littermates due to 
the insufficient uptake of milk, which quite often results in 
perinatal lethality. The adult mice of both genders also have 
various  reproductive  and  behavioral  problems  [32-34]. 
Mutant females produce a relatively small number of mature 
eggs, resulting in reduced litter sizes. Also, pregnant females 
have  problems  in  milk  letdown  and  in  maternal-caring 
behaviors,  thus  causing  the  perinatal  lethality  observed 
among wild-type pups. It is interesting to point out that Peg3 
mutations have effects on a set of paired behaviors between 
the mothers and their pups for milk provision, milk suckling, 
and letdown. This has been a basis for the ‘co-adaptation’ 
theory of mammalian genomic imprinting [35]. In the case 
of  bovine  Usp29,  a  mutation  deleting  a  100-kb  interval 
within  the  middle  250-kb  region  has  been  shown  to  be 
responsible  for  the  stillbirth  of  calves  [36].  The  exact 
mechanism  by  which  this  deletion  causes  stillbirth  is 
currently  unknown,  but  this  mutational  effect  is  overall 

108

consistent  with  the  phenotypes  that  have  been  observed 
from  the  Peg3  domain,  controlling  the  growth  and 
development of the fetus during the gestational period. 

At the cellular level, the predicted functions of Peg3 are 
worthwhile to be discussed. Peg3 is a potential tumor sup-
pressor, given the observation that many human patients 
with ovarian and breast cancers lose the expression of PEG3 
due to DNA hypermethylation on the PEG3-DMR [37-39]. 
This was further demonstrated by in vitro studies in which 
reintroduction of human PEG3 into primary cell lines de-
rived from ovarian cancer patients resulted in the inhibition 
of cell growth [39]. According to recent data from in vitro 
studies, Peg3 also appears to be involved in autophagy in 
endothelial cells [40]. Soluble forms of several structural 
proteins, including decorin, are shown to trigger autophagy 
in endothelial cells as part of the apoptotic pathways that are 
designed  to  remove  stressed  and  damaged  cells.  Inter-
estingly,  PEG3  has  been  found  to  play  a  major  role  in 
conveying this external signal through vesicular endothelial 
growth  factor  receptor  2  (VEGFR2)  to  induce  the  trans-
cription  of two  core  components, BECLIN1 and LC3,  for 
autophagosomes. The potential roles of Peg3 in autophagy 
are  particularly  intriguing,  since Peg3  is predicted  to play 
important roles in the placenta, where autophagy is critical 
for the constant turnover of protein and other nutritional 
materials [41]. It is also relevant to note that nutritional 
starvation  of  pregnant  females  causes  changes  in  the 
expression levels of a subset of mammalian genes. Inter-
estingly,  the  majority  of  these  genes  is  also  affected  by 
mutations on Peg3, suggesting that these genes are likely 
either  direct  or  indirect  downstream  genes  of  Peg3  [41]. 
Thus, Peg3 may be a major player in controlling in nutritional 
supply between females and pups during pregnancy. Since 
autophagy is regarded as a part of apoptotic pathways, the 
potential roles for Peg3 in autophagy are also consistent with 
previous  observations  hinting  at  the  functions  of  Peg3  in 
apoptosis.  These  include  up-regulation  of  Peg3  during 
p53-mediated  apoptosis,  muscle  cachexia  (or  wasting)  in 
response to tumor load, and induction of Peg3 in response to 
hypoxic  conditions  [42-44].  Taken  together,  these  results 
support  the  idea  that  Peg3  is  a  tumor  suppressor  with  a 
potential connection to autophagy.

At the molecular level, the imprinted genes in the Peg3 
domain code for two different types of proteins: a ubiquitin- 
specific protease for Usp29 and zinc finger proteins for Peg3, 
Zim1, Zim2, Zim3, and Zfp264. According to recent studies, 
USP29  might  also  be  a  tumor  suppressor,  given  the 
observation  that  USP29  is  required  for  the  stability  of 
Claspin, a key protein for the DNA damage checkpoint [45]. 
This is quite intriguing, since DNA hypermethylation of the 
PEG3-DMR  has  always  been  regarded  as  an  epigenetic 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

abnormality affecting the expression of PEG3 but not USP29, 
although  the  PEG3-DMR  controls  both  genes.  Thus,  it 
would be interesting to test whether the outcome of this 
DNA  hypermethylation  manifests  as  down-regulation  of 
PEG3 only or PEG3 and USP29 together. Among the four zinc 
finger proteins within the Peg3 domain, Peg3 is the only gene 
that has been studied so far at the protein level. According to 
recent  studies,  PEG3  binds  to  many  genomic  loci  as  a 
DNA-binding  protein  with  transcriptional  repression 
activity [46]. It is well known that many zinc finger proteins, 
including  those  in  the  Peg3  domain,  repress  their  down-
stream  genes  through  interaction  with  KRAB-associated 
protein  1  (KAP-1)  and  SET  domain-containing  histone 
methylase at H3K9 (SETDB1) [47, 48]. Thus, we predict 
that PEG3 may also repress its downstream genes through 
SETDB1/KAP-1-driven H3K9me3. According to recent stud-
ies, several placenta-specific gene families are de-repressed 
in  mouse  embryos  with  the  Peg3-null  mutant  allele;  yet, 
these gene families are usually repressed through H3K9me3- 
mediated  mechanisms  [49,  50].  Thus,  this  result  again 
supports the idea that PEG3 controls its downstream genes 
through H3K9me3-mediated mechanisms. 

At  the  molecular  level,  several  genes  within  the  Peg3 
domain are also predicted to function as ncRNA genes (Fig. 
1). Among these genes, APeg3 is quite unique as an RNA 
gene due to the following reasons. First, it is well conserved 
among  all  mammals  [51].  Second,  it  is  an  antisense 
transcript gene localized in the 3'-UTR of another protein- 
coding  gene−in  this  case,  Peg3  [12].  Third,  APeg3  is 
expressed only in the hypothalamus but highly up-regulated 
in response to osmotic challenge [30]. Given these special 
circumstances,  it  has  been  predicted  that  APeg3  may  be 
designed to control the expression of Peg3. Consistent with 
this prediction, in vitro studies demonstrated that APeg3 has 
the potential to down-regulate the mRNA and protein levels 
of  Peg3  [51].  Although  the  mechanistic  basis  for  the 
observed down-regulation needs to be investigated further, 
the in vivo functions of APeg3 are most likely connected to 
those of Peg3.

Shared Versus Unique Features of the Peg3 
Domain

The Peg3 domain displays unique features and also shares 
several features with the other imprinted domains. First, the 
domain  structure  has  been  well  preserved  during  mam-
malian evolution, as seen in the other domains. This makes 
sense  with  the  prediction  that  the  imprinting  and  trans-
cription of the Peg3 domain are likely controlled, as a group, 
through a shared cis regulatory element−in this case, the 
Peg3-DMR. As part of the conserved genomic interval, many

ECRs are found to be localized within the middle 250-kb 
region and are also predicted to be enhancers for individual 
imprinted genes within the Peg3 domain (Fig. 1). Coordinat-
ing these potential enhancers with individual promoters may 
be needed, since some of these ECRs are likely to be shared 
among  individual  imprinted  genes.  As  an  ICR,  the 
Peg3-DMR might be responsible for this coordinating task. 
According to a situation observed in the H19/Igf2-imprinted 
domain, its ICR functions as an enhancer blocker through 
another transcription factor, CTCF, controlling the access-
ibility of a shared enhancer between H19 and Igf2 [1, 2]. 
Interestingly, the ICR of the H19/Igf2 domain also has an 
unusual cluster of CTCF binding sites, which is very similar 
to the localization of a tandem array of multiple YY1 binding 
sites within the Peg3-DMR [52]. Although both ICRs are 
similar in many ways, their roles as ICRs are likely different 
from each other. This prediction is based on the result that 
YY1 and YY1 binding sites do not display enhancer-blocking 
activity [53]. One plausible role for YY1 might be ‘linking’ or 
‘tethering’  long-distance  enhancers  to  the  corresponding 
target promoters [54]. As described earlier, ECR18 interacts 
with  the  bidirectional  promoter  of  Peg3/Usp29.  This 
long-distance interaction, or linking, between ECR18 and 
the  bidirectional  promoter  may  be  mediated  through  the 
YY1/YY1-binding  sites  within  the  Peg3-DMR  (Fig.  2).  A 
similar scenario is also possible for the other ECRs found 
within  the  Peg3  domain,  which  warrants  a  series  of 
systematic  and  careful  investigations  in  the  near  future. 
Overall, as seen in other domains, the conserved genomic 
structure of the Peg3 domain makes sense with the presence 
of co-regulation through the Peg3-DMR, but the mechani-
sms governing the Peg3 domain by this ICR are likely to be 
unique, based on the involvement of the transcription factor 
YY1.

Second,  the  overall  functional  outcomes  of  the  Peg3 
domain are similar to those observed from other domains, 
such as controlling fetal growth rates and maternal-caring 
behaviors [27, 28, 35]. In particular, this has been consi-
stently demonstrated through functional studies of the Peg3 
locus  [29,  32].  Despite  these  similar  outcomes  at  the 
organismal level, the potential function of each imprinted 
gene  is  likely  to  be  unique  at  the  molecular  and  cellular 
levels. For instance, Peg3 codes for a DNA-binding protein 
with repression activity at the molecular level and inhibits 
cell growth as a tumor suppressor at the cellular level. Yet, 
Peg3 is regarded as a growth stimulator at the organismal 
level, since the down-regulation of Peg3 usually results in 
reduction  in  body  size.  The  functional  outcomes  of  Peg3 
seem to be somewhat contradictory between the cellular and 
organismal levels. This is quite unique compared to other 
imprinted  genes encoding proteins  with  different bioche-

mical properties, such as paternally expressed insulin-like 
growth factor 2 (Igf2) and maternally expressed insulin-like 
growth factor 2 receptor (Igf2r). The phenotypic outcomes of 
this  pair  of  ligand  and  receptor  are  overall  similar  at  the 
cellular and organismal levels [27, 28]. Igf2 stimulates cell 
growth, and thus, higher levels of Igf2 result in bigger body 
size. Igf2r derives exactly the opposite phenotypes to those of 
Igf2, inhibiting cell growth, and thus, more Igf2r results in 
smaller  body  size.  As  proposed  earlier,  the  conflicting 
phenotypes  of  Peg3  at  the  cellular  and  organismal  levels 
could be explained in the following manner [55]. Peg3 might 
be involved in programmed cell death during the develop-
ment  of  neuron  cells−specifically,  a  set  of  neuron  cells 
producing growth suppressors. The absence of Peg3 could 
result  in  the  overgrowth  of  these  neuron  cells  with  an 
excessive amount of growth suppressors at the cellular level, 
causing smaller body size at the organismal level. Although 
this remains to be tested, it is feasible, since many imprinted 
genes are highly expressed in the neuroendocrine system, 
such  as  the  hypothalamus,  which  is  responsible  for  con-
trolling body size through growth hormones [31]. In that 
regard,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  another  paternally 
expressed  DNA-binding  gene,  Zac1  (zinc  finger  protein 
regulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest), also shows similar 
conflicting  outcomes−it  is  a  growth  suppressor  at  the 
cellular level but a growth stimulator at the organismal level 
[56, 57]. Since both Peg3 and Zac1 are growth suppressors at 
the  cellular  level,  these  genes  have  been  quite  often 
identified  as  tumor  suppressors.  Although  the  overall 
functional contributions by the Peg3 domain are similar to 
those of other domains at the organismal level, the detailed 
function of each imprinted gene is predicted to be unique at 
the cellular and molecular levels. 

Third,  the  Peg3  domain  also  contains  several  ncRNA 
genes, as seen in other imprinted domains. These ncRNA 
genes include Zim2, Zim3, and Zfp264 in the rodent lineage 
(Fig. 1). These ncRNA genes are unique due to the following 
reasons. First, these ncRNA genes are of relatively recent 
evolutionary  origin,  so  that  their  ancestral  genes  can  be 
identified easily through sequence similarity to their corres-
ponding protein-coding sequences. It is currently unknown 
whether these ncRNA genes are in the process of becoming 
pseudogenes or have already adapted as ncRNA genes with 
some  functions.  Regardless,  they  have  maintained  their 
transcriptional  activity  for  quite  a  long  time,  given  the 
accumulation  of  mutations  disrupting  their  ORFs,  sug-
gesting that their gene products, ncRNA, or transcription 
itself is now part of the Peg3 domain. If some of them have 
already adapted as ncRNA genes, examining their sequences 
should  provide  some  clues  regarding  how  protein-coding 
sequences become ncRNA genes during evolution. Thus, the 

110

ncRNA  genes  of  the  Peg3  domain  might  provide  a  very 
unique opportunity to understand the evolutionary paths of 
mammalian genes. In that regard, it is relevant to note that 
mammalian X chromosome inactivation-specific transcript 
(Xist) represents another well-known case where a protein- 
coding gene has become an ncRNA gene [58]. Second, some 
functions of these ncRNA genes should be lineage-specific to 
rodents, since the original genes of these ncRNA genes are 
still protein-coding genes in all other mammals. This level of 
lineage-specific change has not been observed from other 
imprinted domains. This might be related to the fact that the 
Peg3 domain has been part of a large zinc finger gene family, 
which is known to be vulnerable to genomic rearrangements, 
including deletion and duplication [14]. Also, the functional 
redundancy afforded by the zinc finger gene family might 
have allowed its members to drift away from their protein- 
coding sequences without severe phenotypic consequences. 
Overall, the structurally conserved genomic interval of the 
Peg3  domain  might  have  allowed  several  protein-coding 
members to adapt into ncRNA genes, which seems to be 
quite different from the evolutionary patterns observed from 
other imprinted domains. 

Future Directions

The Peg3 domain shows many similar features as seen in 
other  imprinted  domains,  which  include  its  conserved 
genomic  structure,  allowing  long-distance  transcriptional 
regulation  through  ICRs,  as  well  as  allele-specific  DNA 
methylation and subsequent monoallelic expression. In the 
past two decades, these unusual features have been studied 
extensively using other imprinted domains as model loci. At 
the  same  time,  the  Peg3  domain  displays  several  unique 
features  that  have  not  been  studied  in  other  imprinted 
domains.  These  unique  features  are  thus  worthwhile  to 
study in the future in increase our understanding of genomic 
imprinting and imprinting-related human disorders. First, 
YY1/YY1-binding sites appear to be a major player in the 
Peg3 domain. In particular, a tandem array of YY1-binding 
sites has been selected for the function of the Peg3-DMR; 
yet, the molecular basis for this function is still unknown. 
One possibility would be that these multiple YY1-binding 
sites might be involved in setting DNA methylation during 
oogenesis.  The  other  possibility  would  be  that  these 
YY1-binding sites might be required for the transcriptional 
control of Peg3 and adjacent imprinted genes. Targeting these 
YY1-binding sites through mutagenesis experiments should 
provide a clear and direct answer regarding the in vivo role of 
multiple YY1-binding sites. Second, Peg3 has been recogniz-
ed as a potential tumor suppressor for some time, without 
any  progress  in  our  understanding.  According  to  recent 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

studies, Peg3 may play a major role in regulating autophagy 
of  endothelial  cells,  which  is  very  intriguing,  due  to  the 
following reasons: 1) Peg3 is highly expressed in the organs 
that  are  regarded  as  endothelial  cell-rich  tissues,  such  as 
placenta,  and  2)  autophagy  is  also  regarded  as  part  of 
apoptotic pathways. Thus, characterizing the potential roles 
of  Peg3  in  autophagy  should  be  a  worthy  project  in  the 
immediate future. Third, the Peg3 domain appears to have 
evolved  very  rapidly  during  mammalian  evolution.  As  a 
consequence, several members of this 500-kb domain have 
changed  from  protein-coding  to  ncRNA  genes.  It  is  well 
known that the ancestral state of a given genomic interval 
cannot be easily reconstructed, due to the many changes that 
have  accumulated  during  long  evolutionary  times.  In  the 
case of the Peg3 domain, its 500-kb genomic structure has 
been so well preserved that its ancestral structure can be 
readily  reconstructed  by  comparing  the  Peg3  domains  of 
several mammals. Thus, careful sequence analyses should 
provide immediate insights regarding the evolutionary paths 
of mammalian genes, especially those that have undergone 
the transformation from protein-coding to non-coding RNA 
genes. Overall, these directions are worthwhile to pursue in 
the near future, which should most likely provide additional 
exciting  information  regarding  how  the  Peg3  domain  is 
regulated and what functional roles the Peg3 domain plays in 
mammalian biology.
