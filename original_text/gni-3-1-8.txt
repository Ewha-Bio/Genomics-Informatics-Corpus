Abstract 
Although much is known about the molecular biology of 
platelets, the megakaryocytes' (MKs) molecular biology 
was not understood so well because of their rareness. By 
the  cloning  and  characterization  of  thrombopoietin 
(TPO), which is the principal regulator of the growth and 
development of the  MKs,  researches on the  MKs have 
been growing rapidly. To understand megakaryocytopoiesis, 
we investigated the gene expression profile of the MKs 
using  oligonucleotide  microarray where  10,1 08  unique 
genes  were  spotted.  Comparing 
fluorescence 
intensities  of  which  ratio  is  ~ 121.  372  genes  were 
up-regulated and 541  genes were down-regulated in MKs. 
For  confirmatory  expression,  RNase  protection  assay

Including several  platelet  related  genes,  GATA binding 
protein  were  highly expressed.  Particularly,  TGF  beta, 
clusterin (complement lysis inhibitor), and thymosin beta 
~ (actin-sequestering molecules) were expressed highly 
1n  MKs. As MKs specific expressed genes may regulate 
normal and pathologic platelet (and/or MK) functions, the 
transcript  profiling  using  microarray  was  useful  on 
molecular understanding of MKs,

Introduction 
While  megakaryocyte  (MK)  plays  critical  roles  as  a 
reservoir of platelets, the process of differentiation  and

platelet formation is not yet illustrated (Tao eta/.,  1999; 
Falcieri  et  a/.,  2000).  The  major  limiting  factor  in 
investigating the process of megakaryocytopoiesis is the 
low  frequency  of  MKs  in  hematopoietic  tissues.  The 
discovery and  cloning  of thrombopoietin  (TPO),  which 
can  differentiate hematopoietic stem cells to  MKs,  has 
provided  the  sufficient  number  of  cells  for  the  further 
study of MKs (Piacibello eta/., 1997). TPO is the primary 
regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. 
TPO supports the differentiation and proliferation of MK 
progenitor  cells,  and  has  an  essential  role  for  the 
complete  maturation  of  MKs.  TPO  also  supports  the 
formation and the function of platelets in vivo and in vitro. 
For the comprehensive analysis of transcript expression, 
the  array-based  hybridization  analysis  and  the  serial 
analysis of gene expression (SAGE) are commonly used 
platforms.  DNA  microarray  is  a  powerful 
for 
monitoring  thousands  of  transcript  levels,  but  it  can 
detect  only  relative  expression  level  by  competitive 
hybridization (Schena et at.,  1995).  SAGE analysis is a 
high-throughput  sequencing-based  technique  and  the 
relative  abundance of transcripts  in  the sample can  be 
estimated because it is able to scale of the transcripts by 
sequence  tags  in  the  SAGE  data(Velculescu  et  a/., 
2002). The microarray technique has some advantages. 
If  using  high-density  microarray,  it  can  profile  several 
thousands of transcripts, simultaneously. Previously, we 
have  performed  microSAGE  in  MKs  and  non-MKs 
derived from the human umbilical cord blood(CB) CD34+ 
cells by ex vivo expansion using TPO (Kim eta/., 2002). 
In the present study, the gene expression profiles of MKs 
were  analyzed  by  high-density  oligonucleotide 
microarray  hybridization  and  RNase  protection  assay 
(RPA)  was  used to validate the  microarray  result.  The 
data  present  herein  showed  that  many  of  the  genes 
differentially  expressed  in  MKs  and  non-MKs  were 
involved  in  encoding  proteins  related  to apoptosis  and 
intracellular signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods 
Purification of CB CD34+ cells 
Human  umbilical  CB  was  obtained  from  the  full-term 
deliveries with the informed consent.  Mononuclear cells 
were  isolated  from  CB  using  Ficoii-Hypaque  (density, 
1.077;  Pharmacia  Biotech;  Upsalla,  Sweden)  density 

Gene Expression Analysis of Megakaryocytes Derived from Human Umbilical Cord CD34+ Cells by Thrombopoietin  9 

centrifugation.  The  CD34+  cell  fraction  was  positively 
isolated  using  an  anti-CD34  monoclonal  antibody 
conjugated  paramagnetic  bead 
(Miltenyi  Biotech; 
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and CD34 progenitor cell 
isolation  kit  (Miltenyi  Biotech),  followed  twice  by  the 
MidiMACS  system  (Miltenyi  Biotech).  The  purity of the 
selected  population was verified by flow cytometry with 
an  anti-human  CD34+  antibody  conjugated  with 
fluorescein 
isothiocyanate  (FITC;  HPCA-2;  Becton 
Dickinson  (BD),  Mountain  View,  CA,  USA).  Aliquots  of 
enriched  cells  were  checked  for  purity  and  were 
consistently greater than 95%. 

Ex vivo expansion and separation of MK and 
non-MK fractions 
The CD34+ cells were cultured at a density of  1.0 x 1 05 
cells/me  in  serum-free  essential  media  supplemented 
with  bovine  serum  albumin,  insulin,  and  transferrin 
(Stem  Cell  Technologies;  Vancouver,  Canada).  The 
cultures were stimulated with  recombinant human TPO 
(50 ng/ml;  Kirin Brewery,  Maebashi, Japan) alone. After 
1 0  days,  MK  fraction  was  separated  from  non-MK 
fraction  using  an  anti-CD61  monoclonal  antibody 
conjugated  paramagnetic  bead 
(Miltenyi  Biotech) 
followed  twice  by  the  MidiMACS  system  (Miltenyi 
Biotech).  The  purity  of  each  separated  fraction  was 
verified  by  flow-cytometry  with  a  different  antibody 
reacting with MKs (FTIC-conjugated anti-human CD41; 
BD). ).  Aliquots of enriched cells were checked for purity 
and were consistently greater than 95%. 

Microarray 
Total  RNA  was  prepared  from  the  separated  MK  and 
non-MK  fractions  using  the  TRIZOL  (Gibco  BRL;  NY, 
USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total 
RNA  (5JLg)  was  converted  into  double  stranded  eDNA 
using  the  eDNA  synthesis  System  (Roche)  using 
T7-(dT)24 primer. The each eDNA was purified using the 
Rneasy kit (Qiagen;  Valencia,  USA).  Each Cy3- (MKs), 
or Cy5- (non-MKs) labeled cRNA was synthesized using 
the  Megascript  T7  kit  (Ambion;  Austin,  USA),  using 
Cy3-CTP  and  Cy5-CTP  (APB;  Uppsala Sweden).  The 
cRNA was purified using the RNeasy. The purified 15JLg 
of  each  cRNA  was  mixed  and  fragmented  in  the 
fragmentation  buffer  (40  mm  Tris  (pH  8.1),  100  mm 
KOAc, and 30 mm MgOAC) by heating to 94C for 15 min. 
The fragmented cRNA was mixed with the hybridization 
buffer containing 100 mm MES, 1 m NaCI, 20 mm EDTA 
and 0.01% Tween 20, and hybridized with MAGIC 11-10 K 
Oligo Chip (Macrogen; Seoul, Korea) for 16 hat 42C. All 
preparations met Macrogen's recommended criteria for 

use  on  their  expression  arrays.  The  arrays  were then 
washed  and  scanned  with  the  Array  scanner  (APB). 
Acquired 
images  were  processed  and  analyzed 
statistically for  interpretation  of analyzed  spot  intensity 
results  using  lmagene  v4.1  software  (Roche).  Non(cid:173)
biological factors that may contribute to variability of data 
were minimized  using global  normalization/scaling with 
data from  all  probes sets.  Each chip contains a total  of 
10,368  elements  of  which  10,108  are  unique  genes/ 
clusters. The length of oligonucleotides was 50-mer. 

RPA (RNase protection assay) 
The  RNase  protection  assay was  performed  using  the 
mouse  cell  cycle  regulator  multiprobe  template  sets, 
hAP0-3,  hAP0-5C  and  Hck-4  (BD  Biosciences). 
32P]-UTP labeled anti-sense RNA probe was synthesized 
[
using T7 RNA polymerase,  and was  purified  by phenol 
chloroform  extractions  and  ethanol  precipitation.  The 
purified probe was mixed with 3JLg of total RNA from MK 
and  non-MK  cells  in  the  hybridization  buffer  and 
incubated for 16 h at 56°C. Free probe and single stranded 
RNA molecules were digested with a mixture of RNase 
A.  The  RNase  protected  molecules  were  purified  and 
resolved on  a denaturing polyacrylamide gel and dried. 
Autoradiographic  signal  was  scanned  on  a  Gel  Doc 
analyzer (Bio-Rad), and the signal intensity of each band 
was using the Quantity ONE version 4.2 (Bio-Rad) and 
normalized to the corresponding GAPDH levels. 

Results 
Comparison of Expression Patterns Between 
MKs and non-MKs 
To  reduce  individual  variation  of  gene  expression,  we 
obtained  CB  from  three  volunteers  as  described  our 
previous report (Kim et at., 2002). The purified CB CD34+ 
cells  were  cultured  in  the  serum-free  liquid  culture 
system  stimulated  with  TPO  for  1 0  days.  Under  this 
condition, MK fraction could be isolated using anti-CD61 
antibody, and the purified CD61 +cells had the characteristic 
MK  morphology  (Ryu  et  at.,  2001).  The  total  RNA 
prepared  from  these  MK  and  non-MK  fractions  were 
processed  to  microarray  analysis.  The  each  purified 
RNA was used for cRNA generation and hybridization to 
the MAGIC 11-10 K Oligo Chip. After the normalization of 
the  fluorescence  intensities,  8,889  transcripts  were 
obtained. The scatter plot that was plotted with Cy3 and 
Cy5 
fluorescent  signal  values  displayed  a  quite 
dispersed pattern in distribution (data not shown).  Each 
dot represents a gene expressed in these two fractions. 
Most of the spots gathered around a 45° diagonal  line,

significant difference in the expression level between the 
two fractions was found in many transcripts. Subsets of 
genes were selected based on the differential  Cy5/Cy3 
expression  ratios that  were  121  in  response.  Out of the 
spotted  genes,  372  genes  were  up-regulated  and  541 
genes  were  down-regulated  in  MKs.  As  shown  on  the 
tables,  we  addressed  each  of these groups separately. 
We  included  accession  numbers,  a short  description  of 
the  gene  function  and  a  reference  for  each  gene  to  a 
recent review on the function of the corresponding gene 
limited MKs. 

Table  1  through  3  show  the  genes  differentially 
expressed  in  MKs  and  non-MKs.  Table  1  shows  the 
increased,  or  decreased  top  30  transcripts  in  MKs 
compared  to  those  in  non-MKs.  The  most  frequently 
increased  transcript  was  identified  to  be  ATP-binding 
cassette  transporter  mrp8  (38.24-fold)  followed  by 
hspc159 protein (33.9-fold), cytochrome p450, subfamily 

xxiv precursor (23.7-fold), protocadherin gamma subfamily 
a,  11,  isoform  1 precursor  (17.4-fold),  and  so  on.  The 
transcripts  increased  in  MKs  could  be  classified  into 
several  groups  according  to  the  functional  relevance. 
Table 2 shows the transcripts regulation-related proteins 
such  as  GAT A-binding  protein  1  (globin  transcription 
factor 1 ), transcription factor BMAL2, partial transcription

factor  19  (SC1)  (TCF19),  transcription  factor  ap-2 
(activating enhancer binding protein 2 , nuclear factor i/c 
(ccaat-binding  transcription  factor).  The  transcripts  for 
metabolic  pathway  related  proteins  are  cytochrome 
p450, subfarrily xxiv precursor, arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase. 
The  gene  for  protease  and  apoptosis  related  genes, 
such  as  mannan-binding  lectin  serine  protease  1,

RNase  protection  assay  (RPA)  for  confirming 
genes showing different expression level in MKS 
and non-MKs 
The  RPA  was  carried  out  wheather  the  expression 
profile  from  the  microarray  is  consistent  with  the 
conventional  RNA  analysis  strategies.  We  used  probe 
set (BD), which were expressed differentially in MKs and 
non-MKs.  Among  the  RPA  probe  sets  (hAP0-5C, 
hAP0-3), cluserin, TRADD and caspase 8 are matched 
with transcripts on microarray. Using RPA assay, selected 
genes were evaluated in MKs and non-MKs derived from 
CBs  of  two  other  volunteers  (Fig.  1 ).  These  results 
validated our expression profiles from the microarray for 
MKs  and  established  the  general  expression  profile  of 
the identified genes. 

Discussions 
In  the  present  study,  the  microarray  technique  was 
employed to understand comprehensively the properties 
of transcripts in  MKs derived from the CB CD  34+ cells. 
The  isolated  CD  34+  cells  were  expanded  with  TPO. 
Then,  these  expanded  cells  were  separated  using 
anti-CD61  antibody, which is known as a marker of MKs. 
Approximately 10 thousands of genes expressed in the 
MKs were  analyzed  using  high  density oligonucleotide 
microarray.  Previously,  we 
reported  global  gene 
expression  of  MKs  using  SAGE technique  (Kim  eta/., 
2002).  When  comparing  to  SAGE  technology,  the 
microarray  method  has  some  advantages,  such  as

simultaneity, detection limit of low expressed genes, etc. 
But, it is not easy to compare the transcription profiles of 
the  microarray  with  that  of  expression  level  of  SAGE, 
because  of  the  different  bases  of  the  underlying 
technology;  the  competitive  hybridization of  probes vs. 
the sequencing of ditags.

erythroid  differentiation-related  factor  1 ,  nuclear factor 
(erythroid-derived 2)-like 1, GATA 1 binding protein, etc. 
In this study, the genes encoding GATA binding protein 1 
and GATA 3 binding protein is highly expressed in MKs 
(4.11  and  2.63  fold  change;  Table  2).  GATA  binding 
protein 1 is essential for the development of megakaryocytic 
and  erythroid  lineages  (Pevny  eta/.,  1991).  However, 
some  MKs  specific  transcription  factors,  such  as 
Kruppel-like factor 1 (erythroid) known as GATA binding 
protein 1 binding partner, erythroid differentiation-related 
factor 1,  Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 1,  sp1 
like transcription factor were not detected on microarray. 
But these genes of MKs, known as specific transcription 
factors,  were  detected  in  MKs  SAGE  library.  This 
phenomenon  induced  from  limitation  of  microarray 
analysis because it could analyze about finite number of 
gene  sequences  localized  to  the  chip.  BMAL  2  was 
expressed highly in MKs (3.95 fold change). The BMAL2 
gene  encodes  a  member  of  the  basic  helix-loop-helix 
PER-ARNT-SIM  (bHLH-PAS)  family  of  transcription 
factors,  which  act  as  transcription  factor  with  CLOCK 
protein  (BMAL2:CLOCK).  Its  role  in  MKs  was  not 
reported yet, but it is known as the regulator of circadian 
rhythm in brain (Cohen eta/., 1997). These up-regulated 
transcription  factors,  such  as  GAT A related  genes and 
BMAL2,  AP-2,  nuclear 
influence 
MK-specific gene expression directly.

Binding  of  TPO  to  its  receptor,  c-Mpl,  results  in  the

included components of the Ras/MAPK pathway (Fichelson 
et  a/.,  2001),  and  PKC  pathway  (Jiang  et a/.,  2002; 
Minamiguchi  et  a/.,  2001).  In  the  present  study,  the 
genes encoding proteins related to Ras/MAPK and PKC 
pathway,  such  as  protein  map/erk  kinase  kinase  5, 
mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  6  and  13,  protein 
kinase c beta 1 and gamma etc were expressed highly in 
MKs  (Table  3).  Tumor  growth  factor- (TGF-)  related 
protein, such as TGF-,  its receptor and binding partner, 
were  up-regulated  in  MKs.  TGF- regulates cell  growth, 
differentiation,  and extracellular matrix production.  The 
intracellular signaling of TGF- is initiated following ligand 
binding  to  the  TGF- type  II  receptor,  which  activates 
TGF- type  I  receptor  (Kalina  eta/.,  2001;  Massague, 
1998).  The  activated  type  I  receptor  phosphorylates 
Smad 2 and Smad 3,  resulting in their translocation into 
the nucleus where they can bind to DNA in the promoters 
of  TGF- target  genes  included  vascular  endothelial 
growth  factor  (VEGF)  (Table  3)  (Heldin  et  a/.,  1997; 
Tokuda eta/., 2003). But in our system, Smad family was 
not  detected  on  microarray.  In  addition  to  the  Smad 
signaling pathway, other signaling pathways such as the 
mitogen-activated  protein  (MAP)  kinase  superfamily 
have recently been shown to mediate the TGF signaling 
pathway (Hatakeyama eta/., 2002). MAPK pathway was 
mediated  in  TGF- signaling  with  Smad  pathway,  and 
PKC and MAPK pathway might influence each other in 
platelet formation. 

In differentiation and maturation, TPO primed signaling 

Interestingly, thymosin beta 4 (Th4) was up-regulated 

Gene Expression Analysis of Megakaryocytes Derived from Human Umbilical Cord CD34+ Cells by Thrombopoietin  13 

(11.2-fold)  and  thymosin  beta  10  (Thw)  was  down(cid:173)
regulated (7.28-fold) in MKs. Thymosin (Th) acts as the 
major actin-sequestering molecule in  mammalian cells, 
and is present ubiquitously in most tissues and cell lines 
and is found in particularly high concentrations in blood 
platelets, neutrophils, macrophages, and other lymphoid 
cells  (Hannappel  et  at.,  1982;  Huff  et  at.,  2001). 
Thymosin  beta  4  has  been  reported  to  prevent  the 
cycling of hematopoietic stem cells (Safer eta/., 1991 ), to 
reduce the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside,  to enhance 
the attachment and migration of endothelium (Bonnet et 
at., 1996), and to induce production of metalloproteinases 
(Malinda eta/., 1997). Clusterin was expressed highly in 
MKs  (4  fold  change;  Fig.  1 ).  Clusterin  was  detected 
highly in SAGE analysis in MKs and platelets (Gnatenko 
eta/.,  2003).  Clusterin,  also  known  as apolipoprotein J 
(Rosenberg et at., 1995), TRPM-2 (Wong eta/., 1993), or 
SGP-2 (Jenne et at., 1992), is an enigmatic glycoprotein. 
Its  expression  is  widely  distributed  in  various  tissues 
(Trougakos and Gonos., 2002; Jones and Jomary, 2002). 
Previous  reports  have  correlated  clusterin  expression 
with  cell  responses  to  stress  (Poon  et at.,  2000),  cell 
damage  recovery  (Bach  et  at.,  2001),  senescence 
(Wright and Shay,  2001 ),  tumorigenesis and apoptosis 
(Marinelli et at.,  1994). Clusterin was contained in alpha 
granule  which 
largest  and  most  abundant 
secretary granules in platelets (Tschopp et at.,  1993).

In  summary,  we  identified  the  genes  expressed 
differentially in  MKs and non-MKs derived from  human 
CB CD34+ cells by  ex vivo expansion using TPO. The 
expression of several genes in  signaling molecule such 
as,  RAS/MAPK,  PKC  and  TGF- related  genes,  was 
higher in MKs.  Interestingly, the genes coding thymosin 
and clusterin were highly expressed in MKs. These gene 
expression  data  from  the  microarray  analysis  may 
provide  useful 
information  on  MKs  differentiation, 
maturation and platelet production.
