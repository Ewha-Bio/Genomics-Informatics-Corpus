Abstract
Glucuronidation by the uridine diphosphateglucuronosy- 
ltransferase 1A enzymes (UGT1As) is a major pathway for 
elimination of particular drugs and endogenous substances, 
such as bilirubin. We examined the relation of eight single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes of the 
UGT1A gene with their clinical factors. For association 
analysis, we genotyped the variants by direct sequencing 
analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 218 
healthy Koreans. The frequency of UGT1A1 polymorphisms, 
-3279T>G, -3156G>A, -53 (TA)6>7, 211G>A, and 686C> 
A, was 0.26, 0.12, 0.08, 0.15, and 0.01, respectively. The 
frequency of -118 (T)9>10 of UGT1A9 was 0.62, which was 
significantly higher than that in Caucasians (0.39). Neither 
the  -2152C>T  nor  the  -275T>A  polymorphism  was 
observed in Koreans or other Asians in comparison with 
Caucasians. The -3156G>A and -53 (TA)6>7 polymorphisms 
of UGT1A were significantly associated with platelet count 
and total bilirubin level (p=0.01, p=0.01, respectively). 
Additionally, total bilirubin level was positively correlated 
with occurrence of the UGT1A9-118 (T)9>10 rare variant. 
Common  haplotypes  encompassing  six  UGT1A 
polymorphisms were significantly associated with total 
bilirubin level (p=0.01). Taken together, we suggest that 
determination of the UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 genotypes is 
clinically useful for predicting the efficacy and serious 
toxicities of particular drugs requiring glucuronidation.

Introduction
Glucuronidation, catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltrans- 
ferases  (UGTs),  is  one  of  the  critical  steps  in  the 
detoxification and elimination of various endogenous and 
exogenous compounds. As for the genes encoding UGTs, 
two subfamilies, UGT1 and UGT2, have been identified in 
humans (Mackenzie PI et al., 1997, Saeki M et al., 2006, 
Sandanaraj E et al., 2007). The human UGT1A gene 
complex spans approximately 200 kb and is located on 
chromosome 2q37 and consists of nine active and four 
inactive exon 1 segments and common exons 2-5. One of 
the nine active exon 1s (namely, 1A1 and 1A3-1A10) can 
be used in conjunction with the common exons (Saeki M 
et al., 2006; Riedy M et al., 2000; Kiang TK et al., 2005; 
Sandanaraj E et al., 2007). The N-terminal domain of the 
UGT1A proteins encoded by the first exon is engaged in 
substrate-binding specificity, and the C-terminal domain 
encoded by the common exons 2-5 plays a role in binding 
to UDP-glucuronic acid (Sandanaraj E et al., 2007) (Fig. 1).
Several  studies  have  displayed  an  association  of 
toxicities of particular drugs with the presence of functional 
polymorphisms  in  UGT1A  isoforms,  which  lead  to 
impairment of the glucuronidation of SN-38 (Sandanaraj 
E et al., 2007; Jada SR et al., 2007, Minami et al., 2007). 
In  addition,  recent  studies  have  suggested  possible 
contributions of UGT1A7, 1A9, and 1A10 to the formation 
of SN-38G (Kiang TK et al., 2005; Minami et al., 2007). The 
presence  of  seven  TA  tandem  repeats  [g.-53(T/A)  7/7; 
UGT1A1*28] instead of six [g.-53(T/A) 6/6; UGT1A1*1] in the 
promoter of UGT1A1 is associated with not only low rates 
of  SN-38  glucuronidation  but  also  the  occurrence  of 
irinotecan-induced severe toxicities.

Additional  functional  polymorphisms  have  been 
discovered in the promoter (UGT1A1*60; g.-3279T>G, 
and g.-3156G>A) and coding regions (c.211G>A (Gly71 
Arg), UGT1A1*6; c.1456T>G (Tyr486Asp), UGT1A1*7; 
c.686C>A  (Pro229Gln),  UGT1A1*27)  of  the  UGT1A1 
gene  (Sandanaraj  E  et  al.,  2007).  Several  functional 
variations  and  haplotypes  of  the  UGT1A9  gene  are 
associated  with  altered  gene  expression  or  catalytic 
activity (Sandanaraj E et al., 2007; Han JY et al., 2006).

*more than 1% of frequency

Recently, Yamanaka et al. found that a one-base insertion 
of thymidine in a promoter region of UGT1A9 (-118(T)9>10, 
UGT1A9*22) has an influence on variable expression of 
the UGT1A9 enzyme.

There are significant racial differences in UGT1A1 and 
UGT1A9 polymorphisms among Asians, Caucasians, and 
Africans. It has been reported that the frequency of the 
UGT1A1*28 (TA)7TAA allele ranges from 15% in Asians 
and American Indians to 45% in sub-Saharan Africans and 
26%  to  38%  in  Caucasians,  Hispanics,  and  African- 
Americans (Marsh and McLeod, 2004). Meanwhile, it has 
been known that the frequencies of -2152C>T, -275T>A, 

and  -118(T)9>10  in  UGT1A9  are  3%,  4%,  and  39%  in 
Caucasians, respectively (Innocenti et al., 2005; Villeneuve 
et al., 2003). Higher frequencies of the -118(T)9>10 allele 
were  observed  in  Asians  compared  with  Caucasians 
(Innocenti et al., 2002).

The goal of the present study is firstly to screen the single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding 
regions of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 in healthy Koreans, and 
secondly, to analyze an association of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 
variants with their clinical and laboratory factors.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
Our research was activated after the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) had approved the study protocol. After written 
consent forms were gathered from 218 healthy Koreans 
visiting to undergo medical examination at Kangnam St. 
Mary’s hospital between April and August 2005, blood was 
collected  from  the  peripheral  vein.  We  established  a 
database  of  clinical  information  of  the  study  subjects 
undergoing  physical  checkups  including  gender,  age, 
smoking  status,  biochemical  test  (albumin,  aspartic  acid 
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin, 
and creatinine), and hematological test (leukocytes, red 
blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet). Using 
an isolation kit (G-DEXTM, Korea) containing a spin column, 
genomic DNA was extracted from 300 uL peripheral blood 
drawn from 218 individuals. The purity of extracted DNA 
was measured by a NanoDrop (ND, USA) and then stored 
at -70℃ until the next experiment. 
Laboratory analysis
DNA sequencing of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 and 
genotyping assay 
For  the  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR),  100  ng  of 
genomic DNA, 10 uM of UGT1A1 primers (3279T>G, 
-3156G>A,  -53  (TA)6>7,  211G>A  and  686C>A)  and 
UGT1A9  primers  (118T9>10,  -275T>A  and  -2152C>T), 
deoxyribonucleoside  triphosphate  (Genemed,  Korea), 
2.5 uM Ace-Taq polymerase (Genemed, Korea), and 10X 
PCR buffer were mixed and adjusted to 25 uL and amplified 
separately using a thermal cycler (Perkin- Elmer, Boston, 
Massachusetts, USA). Electrophoresis (100 V, 20 minutes) 
was carried out on 1.5% agarose gel using gel-loading 
buffer, and DNA amplification was confirmed on an image 
analysis system. The sequence of primers prepared for 
PCR and their reaction conditions are precisely described 
in Appendix A. The amplified PCR products were purified 

by  spin  column  (MEGA-  spinTM,  Korea),  and  then  we 
measured the concentration using the NanoDrop (ND, 
USA). The sequence was analyzed in 218 subjects by the 
BigDye Terminator V31 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster, California, USA) and the ABI 3730XL 
Sequencer (Applied Biosystem, USA). The -53 (TA)6>7 (TATA 
indel) band was confirmed by electrophoresis immediately 
after PCR, and then without purification, it was directly 
injected  into  a  DHPLC  instrument  (denaturing  high 
performance  liquid  chromatography,  WAVE  3500HT 
analysis). Especially, in the case of -118T9>10 among three 
genetic  variants  of  UGT1A9,  we  re-analyzed  and 
confirmed its DNA sequence using gene scan, considering 
the  possible  misinterpretation  due  to  the  slippage 
phenomenon  occurring  in  the  first  analysis  of  direct 
sequencing.

Statistical analysis
All  data  were  analyzed  with  the  Statistical  Analysis 
Systems (SAS) software version 8.01 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC,  USA).  The  clinical  characteristics  of  continuous 
variables were expressed as mean ± S.D. The inter-ethnic 
differences  of  genotype  and  allele  frequencies  for 
UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 polymorphisms were calculated 
using  Fisher's  exact  test.  Differences  in  quantitative 
variables were calculated by Student’s unpaired t-test. The 
bilirubin levels and platelet counts for the different genotypes 
were compared using ANOVA. Allele frequencies were 
estimated by the gene-counting method, and an exact test 
was performed to identify departures from Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium (HWE). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between 
pairs of SNPs was assessed using Lewontin’s standardized 
disequilibrium coefficient∣D'∣and  the  squared correlation 
coefficient (r2). An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm 
was  used  to  estimate  the  haplotype  frequencies.  A 
dominant logistic regression analysis was used for the 
evaluation of the independent effect of the investigated 
genetic  variants,  adjusted  for  the  presence  of  factors.

Results
Baseline  characteristics  of  subjects  and  the 
distribution of genetic polymorphisms in UGT1A1 
and UGT1A9 
The male-to-female ratio of 218 healthy individuals was 
140:78, and their mean age was 45.9 years (range 22-72 
years); the results of the hematological and biochemical 
tests  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  The  distribution  of 
UGT1A1 polymorphisms -3279T>G, -3156G>A, -53  (TA)6>7, 
211G>A, and 686C>A was 0.26, 0.12, 0.08, 0.15, and 0.01, 
respectively. The frequency of -118 (T)9>10 of UGT1A9 (0.62) 
in healthy Koreans was significantly higher than in Asian and 
Caucasian subjects (0.53 and 0.39, respectively). Neither 
the  -2152C>T  nor  the  -275T>A  polymorphism  was 
observed in Koreans or Asians-only in Caucasians. The 
genotype  distributions  for  all  variants  were  in  HWE. 
However, there was no significant deviation from HWE in 
the genotype frequencies of the -3279T>G polymorphism 
(p=0.019).  The  measure  of  LD  was  calculated  for  all 
combinations of SNPs using the Lewontin’s |D’| and r2 
coefficients (data not shown). Strong LD was found in 
-3156G>A with -53(TA)6>7 and 211G>A variants.

The association of individual SNPs and haplotypes 
with clinical factors
The  genotype  distribution  patterns  for  homozygotes  and 
heterozygotes for the -3156G>A and -56 (TA)6>7 polymorphisms 
were not significantly different. However, their differences 
have  statistically  significant  associations  with  platelet 
count (p=0.01 for both) and total bilirubin level (p=0.002 
and  0.004,  respectively)  (Table  2).  We  also  found 
significant associations between total bilirubin levels and 
a particular polymorphism of UGT1A9 (-118(T)9>10), but 
not with -3279T>G, -211G>A, or 686C> A polymorphic 
sites (Table 2, p=0.01).

In a study of association with clinical factors, a higher 
total bilirubin level was observed in heterozygous carriers 
of -3156G>A and -53 (TA)6>7 compared with homozygotes. 
Inversely, the total bilirubin level in heterozygous carriers 
of -118 (T)9>10 was lower than in homozygotes (Fig. 2A, B, 
and C). In addition, it was discovered that platelet counts 
in heterozygous carriers were lower than in homozygotes 
of -3156G>A and -53 (TA)6>7.

There  were  possible  haplotypes  derived  from  all 
polymorphic sites in healthy Koreans. Common haplotypes 
1 (10-T-G-6-G-C), 2 (10-T-G-6-A-C), and 3 (10-G-G-6-G- 
C) were distributed more frequently in subjects (31.6%, 
16.8%, and 16.1%, respectively) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the 
distribution of haplotype 10 (9-G-A-7-G-C) and haplotype 
11  (9-G-A-7-A-C)  was  lower  in  subjects.  Common 
haplotypes  encompassing  six  UGT1A9  and  UGT1A1 
polymorphisms  were  associated  with  bilirubin  levels 
(p=0.01). 
Discussion
Recent studies have shown differences in disposition of 
irinotecan  and  its  metabolites  among  several  ethnic 
groups. These inter-ethnic variations are attributed to a 
genetic basis resulting from occurrence of functionally 

relevant  SNPs  in  genes  encoding  the  various  drug- 
metabolizing enzymes, such as UGT1A, and drug transporters, 
such as the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein, engaged 
in the chemical pathway of irinotecan (Jada SR et al., 
2007).

In  the  present  study,  the  polygenic  influence  of 
functional UGT1A1 -3279T>G, -3156G>A, -53 (TA)6>7, 
211G>A,  and  686C>A  polymorphisms  and  UGT1A9 
-118T9>10, -275T>A, and -2152C>T polymorphisms [STK3]was 
evaluated in healthy Koreans to compare with other ethnic 
groups  to further  understand  the  mechanistic basis  of 
inter-ethnic variation of irinotecan-induced toxicities. In our 
study, it could be postulated that inter-ethnic differences 
exist  in  the  metabolic  profiles  and  pharmacodynamic 
effects of irinotecan, although we did not directly investigate 
racial differences in clinical toxicities induced by irinotecan 
treatment.

Large differences in the distributions of the UGT1A1 
polymorphisms  between  Caucasian  and  Japanese 
populations  have  been  reported;  the  frequency  of 
UGT1A1*28  in  Caucasians  is  higher  than  that  in 
Japanese. On the contrary, UGT1A1*6 and UGT1A1*27, 
the variant sequences in exon 1, have been identified only 
in the Japanese population. Although the clinical significance 
of  irinotecan  chemotherapy  in  cancer  patients  having 
these genotypes in exon 1 remains uncertain, they might 
render  Japanese  patients  to  be  more  sensitive  to 
irinotecan than Caucasians. These findings suggest the 
importance of racial differences of UGT1A1 genotypes in 
irinotecan-induced toxicities (Ando Y et al., 2000).

In the present study, -3156G>A and -53 (TA)6>7 in 
UGT1A1  were  significantly  related  to  platelet  count 
(p=0.01 and 0.01, respectively) and total bilirubin level 
(p=0.002 and 0.004, respectively). We also observed that 
the  total  bilirubin  level  was  positively  correlated  with 
occurrence  of  the  rare  UGT1A9  -118  (T)9>10  variant 
(p=0.01). These data were substantiated in haplotype

to 

analysis.  Common  haplotypes  were  shown  to  be 
associated with increased total bilirubin level. We should 
strive to understand the clinical importance of UGT1A1 
-3156G>A, -53 (TA)6>7, and UGT1A9 -118 (T)9>10 with 
regard

irinotecan-induced 

toxicities.  Thus, 

Beyond our expectation, it was found that platelets 
count  is  correlated  with  these  genetic  variants  with 
statistical significance. Nowell et al. reported the existence 
of a UDP-glucuronic acid-bilirubin conjugation system in 
ADP-activated  human  platelets  and  identified  the 
expression of the UGT enzyme in platelet fractions. Our 
observation is consistent with their result that platelets[STK4] 
are  involved  in  multiple  steps  of  heme  and  bilirubin 
metabolism (Nowell et al., 1998).

Individualization of drug dosage is critical for cancer 
chemotherapy  to  reduce  unnecessary  toxicity  and  to 
improve its therapeutic efficacy, because its therapeutic 
index is often very narrow. Oncologists traditionally have 
practiced determining the dosage of chemotherapeutic 
drugs based on the patient’s physiological factors (e.g., 
age, body surface area), pathological conditions (e.g., 
performance status, organ function), and clinical history 
(e.g.,  previous  treatment).  If  there  is  a  recognized 
difference in drug disposition and sensitivity caused by the 
polymorphic  drug-metabolizing  enzyme,  the  optimal 
dosage required for response with the least toxicity could 
be different in patients with these different genotypes.

We should mention that several biases can modify the 
distributions of the UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 polymorphisms 
in  this  study.  Nevertheless,  it  is  suggested  that  the 
determination of the UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 genotypes for 
irinotecan treatment is useful in oncology.

In summary, comprehensive analysis of UGT1A1 and 
UGT1A9 genotypes showed that these genes are strongly 
linked to each other, and that the interactions among 
functional polymorphisms are related to the alteration in the 
activity of these enzymes. Although it is still hypothetical, we 
suggest  that  the  UGT1A1  -3156G>A,  -53  (TA)6>7,  and 
UGT1A9 -118 (T)9>10 genotypes are important for predicting 
severe toxicities and treatment outcomes of irinotecan- 
based chemotherapy.
