Abstract

The  target  of  rapamycin  (TOR)  signaling  pathway  con-
served  from  yeast  to  human  plays  critical  roles  in  regu-
lation  of  eukaryotic  cell  growth.  It  has  been  shown  that 
TOR  pathway  is  involved  in  several  cellular  processes, 
including  ribosome  biogenesis,  nutrient  response,  au-
tophagy  and  aging.  However,  due  to  the  functional  di-
versity  of  TOR  pathway,  we  do  not  know  yet  some  key 
effectors  of  the  pathway.  To  find  unknown  effectors  of 
TOR  signaling  pathway,  we  took  advantage  of  a  green 
fluorescent  protein  (GFP)-tagged  collection  of  budding 
yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  We  analyzed  protein 
abundance  changes  by  measuring  the  GFP  fluorescence 
intensity  of  4156  GFP-tagged  yeast  strains  under  in-
hibition  of  TOR  pathway.  Our  proteomic  analysis  argues 
that  83  proteins  are  decreased  whereas  32  proteins  are 
increased  by  treatment  of  rapamycin,  a  specific  inhibitor 
of  TOR  complex  1  (TORC1).  We  found  that,  among  the 
115  proteins  that  show  significant  changes  in  protein 
abundance  under  rapamycin  treatment,  37  proteins  also 
show  expression  changes  in  the  mRNA  levels  by  more 
than  2-fold  under  the  same  condition.  We  suggest  that 
the  115  proteins  indentified  in  this  study  may  be  directly 
or  indirectly  involved  in  TOR  signaling  and  can  serve  as 
candidates  for  further  investigation  of  the  effectors  of 
TOR  pathway.

served  from  yeast  to  human  and  specifically  inhibited  by 
a  macrolide  antibiotic,  rapamycin.  It  is  known  that  TOR 
kinase  functions  as  a  key  regulator  of  eukaryotic  cell 
growth  and  development  (Wullschleger  et al.,  2006). 
TOR  kinase  exists  in  two  functionally  distinct  protein 
complexes,  TOR  complex1  (TORC1)  and  TOR  complex 
2  (TORC2)  (Loewith  et al.,  2002).  Especially,  rapamy-
cin-sensitive  TORC1  pathway  plays  critical  roles  in  cell 
growth.  TORC1  affects  ribosome  biogenesis  by  regulat-
ing  transcription  of  all  three  kinds  of  RNA  polymerases 
(Mayer  and  Grummt,  2006).  Inactivation  of  TORC1  re-
sults  in  several  physiological  characteristics  of  nutrient 
starvation,  including  induction  of  autophagy  (Rohde  et 
al.,  2001).  Recently,  it  has  been  highlighted  that  TOR 
signaling  is  deeply  involved  in  eukaryotic  cell  aging  and 
aging-related  diseases.  Inhibition  of  TOR  signaling  ex-
tends  lifespan  in  yeast,  nematode  and  fruitfly  (Jia et al., 
2004;  Powers et al.,  2006;  Zid et al.,  2009).  Although  the 
knowledge  about  TOR  pathway  has  been  greatly  ex-
panded  by  intensive  research  over  the  last  two  decades, 
there  are  still  many  unknown  factors  in  the  upstream 
and  downstream  of  TOR  signaling  pathway  due  to  its 
complexity  and  crosstalk  with  other  signaling  pathways.
    According  to  the  central  dogma  of  molecular  biology 
suggested  about  50  years  ago  (Crick,  1958),  most  of  the 
genetic  information  in  DNA  is  finally  transferred  to 
proteins.  Proteins,  the  final  products  in  the  central  dog-
ma,  are  not  only  fundamental  components  of  living  cells 
but  also  mediators  of  most  of  the  cellular  processes. 
Thus,  to  broaden  our  understanding  of  cellular  functions 
and  processes,  it  is  essential  to  know  the  mechanisms 
how  to  regulate  the  activity  or  abundance  of  each 
protein.  On  these  days,  rapid  developing  technology  in 
life  science  makes  it  possible  to  study  proteins  at  a 
large-scale  or  proteomic  level.  Proteomics  has  become 
well  established  as  a  term  for  studying  proteins  at  a 
large  scale.  Therefore,  proteomic  research  might  be  very 
helpful  in  understanding  the  precise  cellular  functions 
and  processes.
    In  the  present  study,  to  gain  a  novel  insight  into  TOR 
signaling  pathway  in  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  we 
sought  to  analyze  proteomic  expression  changes  in 
yeast  cells  treated  with  or  without  rapamycin.  To  de-
termine  proteomic  expression  changes  in  yeast,  we  took 
advantage  of  a  collection  of  4159  green  fluorescent  pro-
tein  (GFP)-tagged  yeast  strains  (Huh et al.,  2003).  Previ-
ously,  several  researches  have  used  the  yeast  GFP-tag-
ged  collection  for  rapid  and  precise  high-throughput

measurement  of  protein  abundances  which  could  be 
represented  by  GFP  intensities  tagged  on  each  protein 
(Lee  et al.,  2007;  Newman  et al.,  2006;  Song  et al., 
2009).  From  our  proteomic  analysis,  we  show  that  83 
proteins  are  decreased  whereas  32  proteins  are  in-
creased  by  rapamycin  treatment.  We  suggest  that  these 
115  proteins  may  be  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in 
TOR  signaling  and  can  serve  as  candidates  for  further 
investigation  of  the  effectors  of  TOR  pathway.  Further 
study  with  these  candidates  may  reveal  important  in-
sights  into  TOR  signaling  pathway.

Methods

Yeast  strains,  medium  and  reagents

4159  GFP-tagged  yeast  strains  expressing  GFP  fusion 
proteins  (Huh  et  al.,  2003)  were  used  to  monitor 
changes  in  protein  levels.  A  synthetic  complete  medium 
(SC;  0.67%  yeast  nitrogen  base  without  amino  acids, 
2%  glucose)  were  prepared  as  previously  described 
(Sherman,  2002).  Cells  were  grown  to  the  mid-log  phase 
in  SC  medium  at  30oC.  Rapamycin  (Tecoland)  was  dis-
solved  in  DMSO  and  used  at  200  ng/ml  concentration.

Quantitative  proteomic  analysis  using  a  multi-
label  microplate  reader

GFP-tagged  yeast  strains  were  grown  to  the  mid-log 
phase  in  96  deep-well  plates  (Bioneer).  The  optical  den-
sity  (OD)  and  fluorescence  intensity  of  the  cells  were 
measured  in  clear-bottom,  96-well  plates  (Greiner  Bio- 
One)  with  a  multilabel  microplate  reader  (EnVision;  Per-
kinElmer).  The  OD  was  measured  using  a  595-nm  filter. 
Fluorescence  intensity  was  measured  using  an  excita-
tion  filter  of  488  nm  and  an  emission  filter  of  535  nm.

GFP-intensity  data  processing  and  analysis

To  eliminate  cellular  autofluorescence,  we  set  running 
median  through  OD  with  3  parameters  (window  size: 
0.01  OD;  slide  size:  0.002  OD;  count  threshold:  50).  A 
relative  abundance  of  each  protein  was  calculated  as:

  Relative abundance of protein = fluorescence of 

proteinOD - running medianOD

where  fluorescence of proteinOD  is  a  GFP  intensity  of 
each  strain  showing  a  certain  OD  and running medianOD 
is  an  average  GFP  intensity  of  all  strains  showing  the 
corresponding  OD.  To  exclude  an  experimental  variation 
causing  plate  tendency,  standard  deviations  of  non-tag-
ged  cells  and  44  plates  containing  4159  GFP-tagged 

cells  between  GFP  intensity  measurements  at  0,  1  and 
2  hr  were  calculated,  and  14  plates  showing  higher 
standard  deviations  than  those  of  half  of  non-tagged 
cells  were  excluded  for  further  analysis.  Among  the  re-
maining  proteins,  we  selected  115  proteins  showing 
higher  relative  abundance  values  than  1.65Ã—(standard 
deviations  of  non-tagged  cells).

Results

Measuring  protein  abundance  changes  induced 
by rapamycin using a multilabel microplate reader

transcription 

Physiological  functions  of  a  protein  can  be  regulated  at 
the  level  of  abundance.  Protein  abundance  changes  re-
sult  from  a  number  of  regulatory  mechanisms  ranging 
from 
to  post-translational  modification. 
Thus,  change  in  protein  abundance  can  suggest  a  pos-
sibility  of  alteration  in  physiological  roles  of  the  protein. 
As  a  key  regulatory  signaling  pathway  of  eukaryotic  cell 
growth  (Wullschleger et al.,  2006),  TOR  pathway  may  be 
involved  in  the  regulation  of  protein  abundances.  Based 
on  this  consideration,  we  hypothesized  that  protein 
abundance  changes  induced  by  rapamycin,  a  specific 
inhibitor  of  TORC1,  might  indicate  involvement  of  the 
protein  in  TOR  pathway.  To  test  this  hypothesis,  we 
carried  out  a  quantitative  proteomic  analysis  with  or 
without  rapamycin  treatment.
    For  a  quantification  of  the  yeast  proteome,  we  took 
advantage  of  a  collection  of  4159  GFP-tagged  yeast 
strains  (Huh et al.,  2003).  Recently,  several  studies  have 
shown  that  the  yeast  GFP-tagged  collection  can  be 
used  for  profiling  proteome  expression  by  measuring  the 
fluorescence  intensity  of  each  GFP-tagged  strain  (Lee et 
al.,  2007;  Newman  et al.,  2006;  Song  et al.,  2009).  To 
perform  a  proteomic  quantification  of  the  fluorescence 
intensities  of  the  GFP-tagged  yeast  collection  rapidly 
and  precisely,  we  used  a  multilabel  microplate  reader 
that  could  simultaneously  analyze  the  intensities  of  96 
GFP-tagged  yeast  cells.  The  validity  of  GFP-intensity 
data  from  a  multilabel  microplate  reader  was  confirmed 
in  our  previous  study  (Song  et al.,  2009). 
    We  measured  the  fluorescence  of  4159  GFP-tagged 
yeast  strains  grown  to  the  mid  log-phase  with  or  with-
out  treatment  of  200  ng/ml  rapamycin  for  1  hr.  During 
the  data  processing,  we  found  that  about  40%  of  raw 
data  were  not  appropriate  for  further  analysis  and  de-
cided  to  exclude  these  data.  The  remaining  2422  GFP- 
intensity  changes  under  rapamycin  treatment  were  fur-
ther  analyzed.  Consequently,  we  found  that  83  proteins 
were  significantly  decreased  by  rapamycin  treatment 
whereas  32  proteins  were  increased  under  the  same 
condition  (Fig.  1).  These  115  proteins  that  underwent 

significant  protein  abundance  changes  under  rapamycin 
treatment  are  listed  in  Table  1.

Comparison  of  protein  abundance  changes  with 
mRNA  level  changes

In  the  previous  study,  DNA  microarray  was  used  to  ex-
amine  the  genome-wide  transcription  alteration  under 
rapamycin  treatment  (Hardwick  et al.,  1999).  Since  a 
change  in  protein  level  usually  originates  from  an  alter-
ation  in  the  gene  expression,  we  tried  to  compare  the 
protein  abundance  changes  with  the  mRNA  level  chan-
ges  under  rapamycin  treatment.  Among  the  115  proteins 
that  showed  significant  protein  abundance  changes,  37 
proteins  also  showed  â‰¥2-fold  changes  in  the  mRNA 
level  under  rapamycin  treatment.  We  investigated  the 
correlation  between  the  mRNA  and  protein  level  chan-
ges  for  these  37  proteins  (Fig.  2).  The  Pearson  correla-

tion  analysis  of  37  proteins  showed  a  positive  correla-
tion  between  the  mRNA  and  protein  expression  except 
for  3  proteins,  Rck2,  Eno1  and  Mak10.  These  3  proteins 
showed  a  negative  correlation,  and  exhibited  an  in-
crease  in  protein  abundance  while  their  mRNA  levels 
were  decreased  under  rapamycin  treatment.

Functional  classification  of  37  proteins  showing 
changes  in  the  protein  and  mRNA  level  by  rapa-
mycin

The  37  proteins  showing  significant  changes  in  the  pro-
tein  and  mRNA  level  under  rapamycin  treatment  were 
classified  into  the  Gene  Ontology  (GO)  categories  (Ash-
burner  et al.,  2000).  As  shown  in  Table  2,  the  37  pro-
teins  were  enriched  especially  in  the  GO  categories  re-
lated  with  protein  synthesis.  This  enrichment  resulted 
from  inclusion  of  16  ribosomal  proteins.  It  has  been 
shown  that  TOR  signaling  pathway  controls  translation 
initiation  by  regulating  eIF2Î± (Cherkasova  and  Hinne-

busch,  2003)  and  also  plays  critical  roles  in  expression 
of  ribosomal  protein  genes  (Powers  and  Walter,  1999). 
Therefore,  the  enrichment  in  the  GO  categories  related 
with  protein  synthesis  is  consistent  with  the  previous 
reports.
    Notably,  rapamycin  treatment  inhibited  guanosine-5'- 
triphosphate  (GTP)  biosynthetic  process  by  decreasing 
the  protein  and  mRNA  level  of  Imd2  and  Imd3.  Imd2 
and  Imd3  are  important  enzymes  for de novo  GTP  syn-
thesis  whose  abundance  and  activity  are  correlated  with 
cellular  growth  rate  (Jackson et al.,  1975).  It  is  likely  that 
repression  of  de novo  GTP  synthesis  caused  by  de-
crease  of  Imd2  and  Imd3  under  rapamycin  treatment 
may  consequently  contribute  to  inhibition  of  cell  growth. 
This  is  consistent  with  the  critical  roles  of  TOR  pathway 
in  eukaryotic  cell  growth  regulation.

Discussion

A  number  of  regulatory  mechanisms  are  involved  in  pro-
duction  of  a  protein.  The  expression  level  of  mRNA  is 
an  important  clue  to  understand  cellular  processes  and 
functions.  However,  because  of  post-transcriptional 
mechanisms  controlling  the  translation  rate  (McCarthy, 
1998)  and  differential  half-lives  of  mRNAs  (Varshavsky, 
1996),  mRNA  level  alone  does  not  reflect  biological 
events  precisely.  Therefore,  a  quantitative  proteomic 
analysis  profiling  the  whole  protein  expressions  is  very 
useful  for  determination  of  cellular  processes  and  func-
tions.
    In  the  present  study,  we  systematically  analyzed  pro-
tein  abundance  changes  using  the  yeast  GFP-tagged 
collection  under  inhibition  of  TOR  signaling  by  rapamy-
cin  treatment  and  showed  that  the  proteins  engaged  in 
protein  synthesis  are  the  major  regulatory  targets  of 
TOR  pathway.  Especially,  16  ribosomal  proteins  are  in-
cluded  in  the  target  list.  This  result  is  consistent  with 
the  previous  reports.  However,  although  16  ribosomal 
proteins  showed  an  abrupt  decrease  in  protein  abun-
dance  by  rapamycin  treatment,  some  other  ribosomal 
proteins  with  long  protein  half-lives,  such  as  Rpl43a  and 
Rps19a  (Belle et al.,  2006),  did  not  show  any  alteration 
in  protein  level  under  rapamycin  treatment  (data  not 

shown).  It  is  intriguing  that  abundance  of  some  riboso-
mal  proteins  is  immediately  influenced  by  TOR  inhibition 
while  that  of  other  ribosomal  proteins  does  not  have  any 
relationship  with  TOR  pathway.  Further  studies  on  this 
difference  among  ribosomal  proteins  will  be  helpful  in 
elucidating  the  regulatory  mechanism  of  TOR  signaling 
pathway  involved  in  translational  control.
    It  is  worthy  to  note  that  abundance  of  Imd2  and 
Imd3,  the  enzymes  for  de novo  GTP  synthesis,  is  de-
creased  under  inhibition  of  TORC1.  GTP  is  essential  to 
signal  transduction  and  is  converted  to  GDP  through  the 
action  of  GTPases.  Recently,  it  has  been  reported  that 
yeast  Rag  GTPases,  Gtr1  and  Gtr2,  act  as  upstream 
regulators  of  TORC1  and  play  critical  roles  in  coupling 
amino  acid  signal  to  TORC1  (Binda et al.,  2009;  Kim et 
al.,  2008;  Sancak et al.,  2008).  The  fact  that  TORC1  is 
involved  in  GTP  biosynthesis  by  regulating  the  protein 
level  of  Imd2  and  Imd3  suggests  that  TOR  pathway  may 
affect  the  activity  of  several  GTP-binding  proteins  in-
cluding  Gtr1  and  Gtr2.  It  will  be  interesting  to  inves-
tigate  if  TOR  pathway  is  really  involved  in  regulation  of 
the  activity  of  GTP-binding  proteins.
    Previously,  genome-wide  functional  profiling  using  the 
yeast  deletion  library  has  identified  396  mutant  strains 
showing  altered  sensitivity  to  rapamycin  (Xie  et al., 
2005).  We  compared  this  functional  genomic  result  with 
our  proteomic  result.  Among  the  37  genes  that  show 
significant  changes  in  the  mRNA  and  protein  level  under 
rapamycin  treatment,  only  two  genes, PBI2  and MAK10, 
show  alteration  in  rapamycin  sensitivity  upon  deletion. 
This  inconsistency  between  the  genomic  and  proteomic 
responses  to  rapamycin  is  presumed  to  be  due  to  dif-
ferences  in  the  experimental  approaches  for  monitoring 
rapamycin  effects,  and  is  also  indicative  of  a  possibility 
that  TOR  signaling  pathway  influences  cell  physiology  at 
numerous  levels  from  genes  to  proteins.  Thus,  under-
standing  the  difference  between  the  genomic  and  pro-
teomic  responses  to  rapamycin  will  give  further  insights 
into  the  regulatory  mechanisms  of  TOR  signaling  path-
way.
