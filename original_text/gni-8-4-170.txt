Abstract

The  Ribonucleotide  reductases  (RNR)  are  essential  en-
zymes  that  catalyze  the  conversion  of  nucleotides  to  de-
oxynucleotides  in  DNA  replication  and  repair  in  all  living 
organisms.  The  RNRs  operate  by  a  free  radical  mecha-
nism  but  differ  in  the  composition  of  subunit,  cofactor 
required  and  regulation  by  allostery.  Based  on  these  dif-
ferences  the  RNRs  are  classified  into  three  classes- 
class  I,  class  II  and  class  III  which  depend  on  oxygen, 
adenosylcobalamin  and  S-adenosylmethionine  with  an 
iron  sulfur  cluster  respectively  for  radical  generation.  In 
this  article  thirty  seven  sequences  belonging  to  each  of 
the  three  classes  of  RNR  were  analyzed  by  using  vari-
ous 
tools  of  bioinformatics.  Phylogenetic  analysis, 
dot-plot  comparisons  and  motif  analysis  was  done  to 
identify  a  number  of  differences  in  the  three  classes  of 
RNRs.  In  this  research  article,  we  have  attempted  to  de-
cipher  evolutionary 
three 
classes  of  RNR  by  using  bioinformatics  approach.

Introduction

The  Ribonucleotide  reductases  are  enzymes  with  a 
complex  structure  which  are  present  in  all  cellular  or-
ganisms:  bacteria,  viruses,  eukaryotes  and  archaea.  The 
Ribonucleotide  reductase  catalyses  the  reduction  of  ri-
bonucleotide  diphosphate  to  deoxyribonucleoside,  which 
are  precursors  for  the  essential  steps  for  DNA  repair 
and  replication  (Jordan  and  Reichard,  1998).  The  ribonu-
cleotide  reductases  are  divided  into  3  classes-  I,  II  and 
III.  All  the  3  classes  carry  out  the  reduction  reaction  by 
free  radical  chemistry  and  involve  proteins  with  free  rad-
ical  amino  acids.  However  the  metallocofactor  required

for  initiation  of  the  reduction  reaction  and  requirement 

for  oxygen  varies  (Sjöberg  B-M,  1997). 

    Class  I  RNRs  are  aerobic  and  function  strictly  in  the 
presence  of  oxygen  for  the  production  of  tyrosyl  radical 
by  a  di-iron  center.  Escheriachia Coli  was  the  micro-
organism  from  which  the  first  reductase  was  charac-
terized  and  has  become  the  prototype  of  class  I 
(Fontecave et al.,  1992).  The E. coli  class  I  reductase  is 
a  hetero  tetramer  (α2β2)  made  up  of  two  homodimer 
protein  called  NrdA  (α2)  and  NrdB  (β2)  (Nordlund  and 
Reichard,  2006;  Torrents et al.,  2007).  The  β2  polypep-
tide  contains  the  tyrosyl  radical.  The  class  I  RNR  is  fur-
ther  subdivided  into  Ia  and  Ib  class  on  the  basis  of  al-
lostery  and  identity  of  sequence.  Class  Ia  is  encoded  by 
nrdAB  gene  and  class  Ib  is  encoded  by  the nrdEF gene. 
Class  II  RNR  is  best  characterized  from  Lactobacillus 
leichmannii  (Blakley,  1978;  Booker  &  Stubbe,  1993; 
Panagou et al.,  1972).  The  class  II  RNRs  consists  of  a 
single  subunit  (mostly  α2  homodimer)  encoded  by nrdJ 
genes  and  require  adenosylcobalamin  (AdoCbl)  for  radi-
cal  generation.  This  process  does  not  require  oxygen. 
Hence  class  II  RNR  can  work  under  aerobic  as  well  as 
anaerobic  conditions  (Nordlund  and  Reichard,  2006; 
Torrents et al.,  2007).  The  class  III  RNR  generate  glycyl 
radical  by  using  S-adenosylmethionine  (SAM)  as  a  co-
factor  and  NrdG  protein  as  an  activator.  It  consists  of 
α2β2  heterodimer  which  is  encoded  by  the  nrdDG 
genes.  The  class  III  is  represented  by  the  anaerobic 
RNR  of E. coli  (Ollagnier et al.,  1996).  The  class  I  RNR 
genes  are  encoded  by  most  Eukaryotic  organisms 
whereas  a  few  bacteria  and  archaea  have  genes  encod-
ing  two  or  all  three  RNRs  (Jordan et al.,  1999).  All  three 
RNRs  operate  by  a  radical  mechanism.  Also  in  all  three 
RNRs  each  of  the  four  ribonucleotides  are  reduced  by 
a  single  enzyme.  The  substrate  specificity  is  determined 
by  allosteric  effect  due  to  binding  of  nucleoside  triphos-
phate  to  a  particular  site  which  is  different  from  the  cat-
alytic  site.  This  specific  site  binding  is  a  property  is 
unique  to  RNRs  (Jordan  and  Reichard,  1998).  The  class 
Ia  RNRs  also  has  an  activity  site  which  controls  the 
overall  activity  of  the  enzyme  using  ATP  regardless  of 
the  specificity.  Considering  the  different  metallocofactors 
required  by  different  classes  of  RNRs  it  seems  that  the 
three  classes  of  RNRs  evolved  independently. 
    Despite  these  differences  the  similar  catalytic  mecha-
nism  of  all  the  three  classes  of  RNR  and  presence  of 

Ribonucleotide  Reductase  and  Evolution:  Bioinformatics  Perspective    171

ribonucleotide  seems  to  suggest  that  they  evolved  from 
a  common  ancestor  (Reichard,  1997;  Stubbe  et al., 
2001).  Also  the  evolution  of  different  enzymes  at  differ-
ent  times  brings  forward  a  possibility  that  the  original 
RNR  is  a  ribozyme  and  not  a  protein  (Benner  et al., 
1989).
    The  evolution  of  the  three  classes  of  Ribonucleotide 
reductase  has  always  been  an  enigma  with  a  few  sug-
gesting  convergent  evolution  whereas  a  few  suggesting 
divergent  evolution.  In  this  article,  we  analyze  the  se-
quences  of  the  three  classes  of  RNRs,  to  answer  this 
question,  using  a  number  of  bioinformatics  tools. 

Methods 

The  RNR  sequences  for  analysis  were  obtained  from  the 
NCBI  website  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).  The  class 
of  each  of  RNR  sequence  was  reconfirmed  by  using 
RNR  db  a  specialized  database  for  RNR,  which  can  be 
accessed  at  http://rnrdb.molbio.su.se.  Out  of  several 
available  RNR  sequences,  we  selected  only  the  bacterial 

and  archaeal  sequences  and  excluded  viruses  and 
eukaryotes.  A  total  of  37  sequences  representing  the 
core  enzyme  of  the  three  classes  of  RNRs  were  metic-
ulously  chosen  based  on  their  size,  genetic  composition, 
radical  chemistry,  cofactor  requirement  and  organism 
origin.  We  obtained  fourteen  sequences  of  bacteria  be-
longing  to  Class  I-  seven  sequences  representing  class 
Ia  and  seven  sequences  representing  class  Ib.  We  ob-
tained  ten  sequences  of  class  II  which  had  both  bacte-
rial  as  well  as  archaeal  sequences.  Class  III  was  repre-
sented  by  thirteen  bacterial  sequences.  Until  now,  vari-
ous  hypotheses  regarding  the  evolution  of  three  classes 
of  RNR  have  been  proposed.  Here,  for  the  first  time  we 
tried  to  analyze  the  evolution  of  the  3  classes  of  RNRs 
using  bioinformatics.
    MEME  Motif  discovery  tool  was  used  to  identify  the 
similar  motifs  in  each  of  the  sequences.  All  the  settings 
were  set  to  default,  except  for  the  maximum  number  of 
Motifs  which  was  increased  from  three  to  ten  (Bailey et 
al.,  2006).  The  phylogenetic  tree  and  the  motif  analysis 
were  then  used  to  construct  dot  plots.  The  position  of

left  are  the  names  of  all  archaea  and  bacteria  whose  RNR  sequences  were  taken  for  analysis.  Except  for  sequences  15 
through  20  which  are  obtained  from  archaea  rest  all  belong  to  bacteria.  Sequences  1  through  7  represent  class  Ia,  8  through
14  class  Ib,  15  through  24  class  II  and  25  through  37  class  III.  The  numbers  corresponding  to  the  archaeal  and  bacterial
sequences  in  above  table  are  also  used  in  analysis  in  (B).  (B)  The  sequences  of  motifs  2,  5  and  8  are  shown  in  the  figure
above.  Beginning  from  left  the  first  column  shows  the  number  corresponding  to  the  name  and  number  of  the  bacteria/arch-
aea  in  table  of  (A).  The  second  number  represents  the  sequence  length  in  RNR  enzyme  and  the  third  column  shows  the 
sequence.  So  in  Motif  2  the  first  number  is  7  which  represents  bacterium Haemophilus somnus  2336  with  a  sequence  length 
of  739  amino  acids  which  is  shown  in  the  sequence.

a  specific  amino  acid  motif  in  the  selected  protein  se-
quence  was  found  by  dot  plots.
    In  order  to  compare  the  similarity  as  well  as  differ-
ence  in  the  sequences  of  each  class  of  RNR  the  dot 
matcher  program  was  used  to  construct  dot  plots.  The 
similarity  in  the  protein  sequences  can  be  easily  as-
sessed  from  dot  plots  simply  by  seeing  a  diagonal  frag-
ment  in  between  the  X  and  Y  axis  of  a  graph,  which  is 
constructed  by  using  data  matrix,  distance  matrix  and 
chi  squared  analysis  (Landes et al.,  1998).  Thus  similar 
sequence  show  a  diagonal  line  whereas  this  line  is  ab-
sent  or  highly  fragmented  in  dissimilar  sequences.  We 
first  constructed  dot  plots  by  using  sequences  belong-
ing  to  the  same  class  of  RNR  and  then  by  using  each 
sequence  from  a  different  class,  using  different  combi-
nations  of  class  each  time.  The  parameters  of  the  pro-
gram  were  mostly  set  at  default  except  for  window  size 
of  10  and  a  threshold  of  23  (Rice  and  Longden,  2000).
    The  selected  sequences  were  obtained  in  FASTA  for-
mat  and  then  aligned  by  using  Clustal  X  (Thompson et 
al.,  1997).  Neighbour  joining  method  was  used  to  con-
struct  the  phylogenetic  tree  from  the  sequences  which 
were  aligned  using  PHYLIP  (Felsenstein,  1989).  The  phy-
logenetic  tree  was  then  bootstrapped  in  order  to  see 
how  well  the  sequences  related  to  each  other.  Finally 
treeview  was  used  to  see  their  position  in  each  clade 
and  study  if  the  RNR  sequences  were  related  by  evolu-
tion  (Page  et al.,  1996).

Results

Analysis  of  RNR  motifs  in  class  I,  class  II  and  Class  III 
of  RNR  reveals  the  distinct  features  in  all  the  three 
classes  of  RNRs  (Fig.  1).  The  RNR   of  class  Ia  and 
Ib  share  Motif  2  and  Motif  8.  These  two  motifs  are  pres-
ent  in  sequences  1  (Methylobacillus  flagellatus  KT) 
through  14  (Mycoplasma pneumoniae M12).  Motif  5  is 
present  in  all  bacteria  of  only  class  Ia  and  three  bacte-
rial  sequences  of  class  Ib:11  (Corynebacterium ammo-
niagenes),  12  (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica sero-
var Typhimurium str. LT2)  and  13  (Escherichia coli 536). 
Motif  1,  3,  6  and  10  are  present  in  sequences  1 
(Methylobacillus flagellatus KT)  through  24  (Streptomy-
ces griseus subsp. griseus NBRC 13350)  which  in-
corporates  all  the  sequences  from  class  I  and  class  II. 
Motif  7  and  Motif  9  are  present  in  sequences  belonging 
to  class  I,  class  II  and  a  few  sequences  of  class  III. 
Motif  7  is  present  in  sequences  from  1  (Methylobacillus 
flagellatus KT)  through  32  (Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 
20016)  with  the  exception  of  sequence  27  (Corynebac-
terium efficiens YS-314)  whereas  Motif  9  is  seen  in  se-
quences  1  through  25  (Streptococcus pyogenes M1 
GAS)  except  sequence  14,  sequences  30  (Streptococ-
cus sanguinis SK36)  and  sequence  31  (Streptococcus 
pneumoniae ATCC 700669).  However,  there  is  no  motif 
that  is  common  to  all  members  belonging  to  class  III 
RNR. 
    The  degree  of  similarity  between  the  protein  se-
quences  of  the  three  classes  of  RNR's  can  be  easily 
seen  by  comparing  the  dot  plots  in  Fig.  2.  The  dot  plots 

Fig.  2.  The  dot  plot  comparison 
of  sequences  belonging  to  the 
same  class  resulted  in  a  collinear 
diagonal  fragment.  The  dot  plots 
are  within  same  class  of  RNRs 
such  as  class  Ia  /class  Ia,  class  II 
/class  II  and  class  III/  class  III. 
Dot  plot  comparison  using  RNRs 
from  different  classes  such  as 
class  II/class  Ia,  class  III/classII 
and  class  III/classIb  resulted  in  a 
plot  with  numerous  non  collinear 
fragments.

constructed  with  sequences  belonging  to  same  class 
shows  a  linear  graph  whereas  dot  plots  constructed  in 
between  two  classes  show  a  high  degree  of  dissimi-
larity.  Dot  plots  constructed  even  within  two  subclasses 
of  the  same  class:  class  Ia  and  class  Ib  resulted  in  non-
collinear  multiple  fragments.  These  findings  match  with 

the  motifs  discovered  which  are  shared  only  between  a 
particular  class.
    As  seen  in  Fig.  3  below  phylogenetic  analysis  of  the 
three  classes  of  RNRs  resulted  in  the  formation  of  a  tree 
with  three  distinct  clades  for  class  I,  class  II  and  class 
III  RNRs.  Class  I  is  further  subdivided  into  two  clades: 

174    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(4)  170-176,  December  2010

class  Ia  and  class  Ib.  The  bootstrap  value  for  class  I, 
class  II  and  class  III  RNRs  are  mostly  above  ninety  and 
from  the  tree  we  can  infer  that  all  the  three  classes  of 
RNR  share  a  common  ancestor.  As  seen  in  Fig.  3,  the 
lower  bootstrap  score  is  only  seen  between Clostridium 
difficile 630  and  Deinococcus radiodurans  R1  both  be-
longing  to  RNR  class  Ib. Clostridium difficile 630  by  its 
spore  forming  ability  is  highly  resistant  whereas  Deino-
coccus radiodurans R1  is  radio  resistant.  These  bacteria 
have  adapted  themselves  to  new  environments  which 
other  bacteria  and  archaea  were  not  able  to  propagate 
and  this  fact  is  reflected  in  the  RNR  sequence  of  these 
bacteria  and  the  evolutionary  distance  in  the  phyloge-
netic  tree.

Discussion

The  three  classes  of  RNR  share  a  common  ancestor 
and  each  class  evolved  independently  from  each  other 
before  the  tree  of  life  diversified  (Torrents et al.,  2002). 
The  multiple  sequence  alignment  which  was  performed 
on  37  bacterial  and  archaeal  sequences  representing  all 
3  classes  of  RNRs  gives  sufficient  evidence  to  conclude 
that  they  all  have  a  common  evolutionary  origin.  The 
phylogenetic  tree  shows  three  distinct  clades  for  each 
class  of  RNR,  thus  providing  a  definitive  evidence  of 
common  ancestral  origin  of  all  classes  of  RNRs  with  di-
vergent  evolution.  All  the  three  classes  of  RNRs  synthe-
size  deoxyribonucleotides  by  catalyzing  the  disruption  of 
2’  carbon-hydroxyl  bond  to  form  2’carbon  hydrogen 
bond.  The  solvent  provides  the  hydrogen,  which  re-
places  the  hydroxyl  while  retaining  the  overall  config-
uration  (Licht et al.,  1999).Using  the  prototype  for  class 
I  (Escheriachia Coli)  and  Class  II  (Lactobacillus leich-
mannii)  enzymes  the  radical  mechanism  of  ribonucleo-
tide  reduction  can  be  described  in  brief  as  follows 
((Blakley,  1978;  Booker  &  Stubbe,  1993;  Fontecave  et 
al.,  1992;  Panagou et al.,  1972).  The  Cys439  of  the  E. 
coli  or  Cys408  of  the L. leichmannii  has  a  thiyl  radical. 
The  thiyl  radical  creates  an  active  substrate  radical  by 
removing  hydrogen  from  C-3’.  Two  redox  active  cys-
teines  (Cys  225  and  Cys462  in E. coli  and  Cys119  and 
Cys  419  in  L. leichmannii)  reduce  the  active  substrate 
radical  (Reichard,  1997;  Stubbe  et al.,  2001).  The  thiyl 
radical  is  generated  from  the  tyrosyl  radical  in  presence 
of  oxygen  linked  di  iron  center  in  class  I  RNR  and  from 
adenosylcobalamin  in  class  II  RNR.  Class  III  RNR  has 
glycyl  radical  as  stable  radical  on  the  large  subunit  and 
has  4Fe-4S  cluster  and  requires  S-adenosylmethionine 
for  radical  generation  (Ollagnier  et al.,  1996).  Indirect 
evidence  suggesting  participation  of  cysteines  and  thiyl 
radical  in  reduction  of  the  ribose  ring  in  class  III  RNR 
also  occurs  (Uhlin  et al.,  1994).  So  similar  catalytic 

mechanism  suggests  a  common  ancestory.  The  level  of 
deoxyribonucleotides  is  maintained  by  regulation  of 
RNRs  by  allosteric  as  well  as  transcription  regulatory 
mechanism.  Allosteric  control  is  achieved  by  binding  of 
nucleoside  triphosphates  to  a  specificity  site  on  the 
substrate  which  is  distinct  from  the  active  site  along 
with  binding  of  ATP  or  dATP  to  active  site  causing  stim-
ulation  or  inhibition  respectively,  and  thus  controlling  the 
overall  activity  of  the  enzyme  (Nordlund  and  Reichard, 
2006).
    In  the  past  few  years  NrdR,  which  was  first  described 
in Streptomyces coelicolor  (Borovak et al.,  2004)  is  be-
ing  suggested  as  a  novel  global  regulator  controlling  the 
expression  of nrd  genes  in  all  three  classes  of  RNRs.  It 
has  been  reported  that  in  a  variety  of  microorganisms  a 
putative  NrdR  box  is  present  upstream  of  nrd  genes 
from  all  three  classes  of  RNRs  (Rodionov et al.,  2005). 
NrdR  has  an  ATP  cone  which  is  similar  to  the  RNR 
class  I  and  III  allosteric  activity  site;  suggesting  intra-
cellular  ATP/dATP  pools  acting  as  a  stimulus  for  NrdR 
for  regulation  of  nrd  expression  (Aravind  et al.,  2000). 
The  analysis  of  the  different  motifs  show  that  class  I 
has  unique  motifs  2  and  8  which  are  absent  in  the  two 
other  classes  of  RNRs.  Class  I  and  II  do  share  Motifs 
1,  3,  6  and  10  providing  evidence  that  class  I  and  II  are 
more  closely  related  than  class  III.  Also,  a  unique  motif 
present  in  only  class  III  RNR  sequences  is  non-  existent. 
Motif  5  is  peculiar  as  it  is  present  in  all  bacteria  and 
archaea  belonging  to  class  Ia.  However  it  is  present  in 
only  sequences  11  through  13  of  class  Ib  and  excludes 
sequences  8,  9,  10  and  14.  Deinococcus radiodurans 
R1  and Clostridium difficile 630  are  highly  resistant  or-
ganisms  and  probably  evolved  and  adapted  to  certain 
environments  which  other  bacteria  and  archaea  were 
not  able  to  propagate  and  hence  lack  motif  5.  The  same 
fact  is  further  highlighted  by  low  bootstrap  scores  of 
these  two  bacteria  in  phylogenetic  analysis.  Mycoplas-
ma genitalium G3  and  Mycoplasma pneumoniae M129 
have nrdF  sequences  that  have  a  Val,  Pro  and  Lys  in-
stead  of  Glu98,  Glu157  and  Glu192  respectively  (Eriksson 
et al.,  1998).  This  explains  absence  of  Motif  5  in  these 
two  bacteria.
    The  dot-plots  which  were  used  as  a  comparative  tool 
between  two  sequences  showed  a  high  degree  of  sim-
ilarity  within  members  of  the  same  class.  However  dot 
plots  between  members  of  different  classes  just  resulted 
in  multiple  fragments  without  solid  collinear  lines  sug-
gesting  no  similarity  between  sequences  of  different 
classes.  These  results  are  consistent  even  with  Motif 
analysis.  In  conclusion,  we  can  say  that  the  three 
classes  of  RNRs  have  a  common  ancestor  yet  they 
evolved  separately.  In  this  study  by  comparing  the  or-
ganization  of  motifs,  the  protein  sequences,  dot  plots

and  phylogenetic  analysis  we  can  see  a  clear  picture  of 
the  differences  in  the  three  classes  of  RNRs  and  their 
evolution.  The  ability  of  Ribonucleotide  reductases  to 
convert  nucleotides  to  deoxynucleotides  has  made  them 
a  potential  target  for  designing  antitumor  (Plunkett et al., 
1996)  and  antiviral  drugs  (Duan  et al.,  1998).  In  this 
study  we  considered  only  bacterial  and  archaeal  se-
quences.  Further  research  may  be  done  by  comparing 
all  classes  of  RNRs  in  archaea,  bacteria  and  Eukarya  to 
get  a  more  comprehensive  picture  of  the  evolution  of 
the  Ribonucleotide  reductase.  This  knowledge  will  be 
useful  to  ascertain  the  role  played  by  RNRs  in  linking 
the  DNA  and  RNA  world.
