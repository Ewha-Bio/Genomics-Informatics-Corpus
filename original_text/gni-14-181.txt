Glucose tolerance tests have been devised to determine the speed of blood glucose clearance. Diabetes is often tested with 
the standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), along with fasting glucose level. However, no single test may be sufficient for 
the diagnosis, and the World Health Organization (WHO)/International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has suggested composite 
criteria. Accordingly, a single multi-class trait was constructed with three of the fasting phenotypes and 1- and 2-hour OGTT 
phenotypes from the Korean Association Resource (KARE) project, and the genetic association was investigated. All of the 18 
possible combinations made out of the 3 sets of classification for the individual phenotypes were taken into our analysis. 
These  were  possible  due  to  a  method  that  was  recently  developed  by  us  for  estimating  genomic  associations  using  a 
generalized index of dissimilarity. Eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were found to have the strongest main 
effect are reported with the corresponding genes. Four of them conform to previous reports, located in the CDKAL1 gene, 
while the other 4 SNPs are new findings. Two-order interacting SNP pairs of are also presented. One pair (rs2328549 and 
rs6486740) has a prominent association, where the two single-nucleotide polymorphism locations are CDKAL1 and GLT1D1. 
The latter has not been found to have a strong main effect. New findings may result from the proper construction and 
analysis of a composite trait.

Introduction

Genome-wide  association  studies  have  been  aiming  to 
find  the  association  between  a  single-nucleotide  polymo-
rphism (SNP) and complex traits. It started as a single-locus 
approach that tested a single SNP at a time and selected the 
top SNPs. However, it has become clearer that most complex 
diseases  are  associated  with  multiple  genes  and  their 
interactions.  Therefore,  a  multi-locus  approach  is  now 
regarded as a necessity [1, 2]. Multifactor dimensionality 
reduction  is  one  of  the  widely  accepted  methods  for 
addressing this issue [3]. Meanwhile, it has been customary 
to categorize a phenotype into a binary trait to divide the 

observed outcomes into either a case or control (affected-un-
affected). However, some diseases, such as obesity, are to be 
classified with several levels of affectedness [4]. In that case, 
it would be appropriate to perform a multi-class phenotype 
analysis. A disease, such as hypertension, may not be fully 
characterized  by  a  single  phenotype  but  by  2  or  more 
observed  phenotypes  [5].  Then,  a  composite  phenotype 
should be constructed and analyzed with genomic data to 
estimate  the  genome-wide  association  of  the  particular 
disease. Because the individual observables should have 2 or 
more classes, a composite phenotype would be a multi-class 
trait, with an indefinite number of classes. Combining the 2 
aspects above, a genomic association study needs a method 
that is able to take gene-gene interactions and multi-class

and multivariate traits into consideration simultaneously. 
In this paper, we will apply a recently introduced gene-
ralized index of dissimilarity (GIDS) [5] to demonstrate a 
multivariate  multi-class  trait  genomic  association  study 
with diabetes. A composite phenotype with the complete set 
of classes, which was constructed with 3 individual pheno-
types obtained by measuring the blood glucose levels using 
different protocols [6, 7], was analyzed with genomic data to 
estimate the genome-wide association. Gene-gene interactions 
and the main effect were investigated. Among the strongly 
associated  SNPs,  some  were  found  to  be  consistent  with 
previous results, while the rest of them were new findings. 
SNP pairs that were found to have a strong association are 
also presented.

Methods
Index of dissimilarity as a measure of association

Introduced originally as a segregation measure [8], the 
index of dissimilarity (IDS) has been shown to be effective in 
measuring genomic associations, as well [5]. A generalized 
version of the IDS (GIDS) has been reported to be able to 
yield the association strength with a phenotype having an 
arbitrary number of classes [5]. Fig. 1 has the schematics for 
the  association  of  2-order  gene-gene  interactions  with  a 
J-class phenotype. GIDS is defined as below following the 
notation in Fig. 1.

Indices i and j represent the ith multi-locus genotype and the 
jth multi-class phenotype, respectively. The numerator of this 
equation  measures  the  extent  of  uneven  distributions  by 
each phenotype class, where the denominator indicates the 

maximum possible unevenness [8]. To visualize this concept, 
let us reduce GIDS to a binary—i.e., J = 2, class—as shown in 
Eq. (2).

When there is little association between the genotype and 
phenotype, there would be a minimal difference between the 
2 fractional terms for each i. Maximum association occurs 
when the differences for each i in this equation add up to the 
maximum.

Estimation of the association strength

To estimate the association strength, GIDS is calculated 
using Eq. (1). The number of samples, nij, that goe into the 
formula  for  GIDS  is  counted  using  a  2-way  contingency 
table, constructed for the k-locus interactive genotype and 
J-class phenotype, as diagrammed in Fig. 1. The number of 
elements of this table will be 3k × J. GIDS would be cal-
culated exhaustively for every SNP or combination of SNPs 
associated  with  a  multi-class  categorical  phenotype.  Any 
order of a gene-gene interaction associated with a phenotype 
of  an  arbitrary  number  of  categories  can  be  estimated  in 
theory, limited only by computing time. GIDS spans from 0 
to 1, representing null and maximum association at either of 
the extremes. p-values that account for multiple comparisons 
can be obtained by constructing a null distribution common 
to all of the GIDS values [9]. Permutation of the dataset is 
performed  to  provide  a  non-associated  dataset.  A  single 
GIDS that has the maximum value among all GIDS values 
obtained  with  a  permuted  dataset  is  collected.  Repeated 
permutation  and  collection  make  the  null  distribution  of 
GIDS. Now, a p-value should be the probability that the null 
distribution exceeds a particular GIDS value. Using this null

Analysis

Construction of multi-class phenotype
Among the procedures to measure blood glucose levels, 
fasting  and  the  oral  glucose  tolerance  test  (OGTT)  are 
commonly  conducted  [11,  12].  Standard  time  intervals 
between  the  intake  and  measurement  are  1  h  and  2  h, 
denoted as OGTT-1h and OGTT-2h [7]. Diagnostic criteria 
are recommended as a combination of the measurements 
[6].  Listed  in  Table  1,  the  diagnosis  is  determined  by 
considering fasting and OGTT-2h simultaneously [7]. Each 
of them was categorized into 3 distinct ranges, resulting in 9 
composite ranges, which gave the criteria for the 4 diagnostic 
categories.  Genomic  data  from  the  Korean  Association 
Resource  (KARE)  project  [13]  were  analyzed  with  the 
phenotypes  of  fasting  and  OGTT-2h  and  -1h.  With  the 
number of valid samples (n = 8371), the proportions that 
fell into each of the 9 composite categories are shown in the 
fourth column of Table 1. Note that neither of fasting and 
OGTT-2h can determine the diagnostic result independently 
of each other. An additional diagnostic criterion may be given 
by  OGTT-1h  [7].  The  last  column  of  Table  1  shows  the 
percentage of the samples that were found to be normal in 
OGTT-1h within each of the 9 composite categories. A need

for additional categorization seems to be apparent, because 
most of the percentages are away from 0% or 100%. To make 
such  a  multi-class  phenotype,  3  of  the  individual  KARE 
phenotypes—fasting,  OGTT-2h,  and  OGTT-1h—were  first 
categorized into 3 classes for the first 2 phenotypes and into 
2 classes for the third one, following the reference criteria [6, 
7].  A  single  composite  phenotype  of  3×3×2  classes  was 
constructed  as  such.  The  resulting  18-class  composite 
phenotype was analysed with the genotype part using GIDS 
to  identify  the  most  associated  single-  and  two-locus 
models.

associated  protein  1-like  1  (CDKAL1)  gene  located  in 
chromosome  6.  This  gene  has  been  reported  to  make 
contributions to type II diabetes. Both of the SNPs identified 
in this paper have been also reported to have susceptibility to 
type II diabetes [14-17]. Note that among the second-tier 
SNPs—rs2328549 and rs17487711—only the first one is in 
the  intron  of  CDKAL1  [18].  rs17487711  has  been  newly 
identified to have strong association comparable with that of 
rs2328549,  while  it  is  located  in  the  intron  of  LOC- 
105379297  in  chromosome  8.  The  National  Center  for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) still describes this gene 
as uncharacterized. In Table 2, 3 out of 4 among third-tier 
SNPS have been listed to be in the intron of ATPase, class II, 
type 9B (ATP9B) located in chromosome 18 [19], whereas 
rs9465871 can be found in the intron of CDKAL1 [20-22].

A single prominent pair (rs2328549, rs6486740) revealed 
itself. In Table 3, detailed information is provided for the top 
5 pairs. One of the SNPs in the pair that showed the strongest 
association,  rs6486740,  is  located  in  an  intron  of  the 
glycosyltransferase 1 domain-containing 1 (GLT1D1) gene 
on  chromosome  12,  while  the  other  SNP,  rs2328549,  is 
located in an intron of CDKAL1, which was mentioned in the 
previous subsection. GLT1D1 was reported to be related with 
renal sinus fat [23] and the transfers of glycosyl groups [24]. 
Among the second-tier SNP pairs, rs7029094 and rs1995761 
are  located  on  chromosome  9,  but  there  exists  little 
information about the gene in which they are located.

Discussion

A composite trait of 18 classes, constructed with 3 obser-
vables, each of which had 3 or 2 classes, was analyzed with 
genomic  data  to  estimate  the  genome-wide  association. 
Gene-gene  interactions,  as  well  as  the  main  effect,  were 
investigated.  It  may  be  essential  to  take  a  multi-class 
composite phenotype into consideration when performing a 
genomic association study for the susceptibility to a more

sGIDS, the top 50 SNPs are plotted in Fig. 2, representing the 
main effects. Prominent SNPs may be seen in groups of 2, 2, 
and 4 showing the strongest association strengths. Those 
SNPs are listed in Table 2 with detailed information. 

Using the calculations for the single-locus model, 1,000 
SNPs were selected by sorting them with their respective 
GIDS  values.  Then,  all  of  the  possible  pairs  of  those 
candidate  SNPs  were  examined  for  their  association 
strengths  by  evaluating  sGIDS.  The  50  most  strongly 
associated pairs are plotted in Fig. 3, 5 of which are identified 
with their rs numbers.

Results

Two SNPs, rs7747752 and rs7767391, were found to have 
the strongest association. They are located in an intron of the 
cyclin-dependent-like kinase 5 (CDK5) regulatory subunit

complex disease, such as diabetes, as presented in this paper. 
OGTT-2h alone has 3 categories that exceed the commonly 
used dichotomous classes. However, the intrinsic need of a 
composite phenotype comes from the fact that diabetes may 
not be fully diagnosed with a single observable. If a disease 
may be diagnosed by multiple variables, it would be logical to 
analyze  the  susceptibility  to  it  with  multiple  observables 
concurrently.  A  composite  phenotype  can  be  expected  to 
have  many  classes,  and  the  number  of  them  could  grow 
rapidly  as  the  number  of  required  variables  increases. 
Therefore,  it  would  be  essential  to  have  a  methodology 
capable of analyzing the genomic association with a pheno-
type having an indefinite number of classes. GIDS has been 
demonstrated, in this paper, as a reliable candidate for this 
purpose. It showed consistency by identifying strongly asso-
ciated  SNPs,  in  chromosome  6,  agreeing  with  previously 
reported ones in a single-locus model. The CDKAL1 gene, in 
which they are located, has been found to be responsible for 
the SNPs that cause the susceptibility to type II diabetes. 
Moreover, we found new SNPs that have not been reported 
to have a strong association. They were found in chromo-
somes 8 and 18. The gene-gene interaction result detected a 
single prominent SNP pair that was noticeably stronger than 
others. Although 1 of the 2 SNPs in that pair, rs6486740 in 
the GLT1D1 gene, was not found to have a strong main effect, 
it showed a very strong association when it interacted with 
the counterpart SNP, rs2328549.

In summary, we have confirmed previous results and at 
the same time found new strong genomic associations in 
both  single-  and  2-locus  models  by  applying  GIDS  to  a 
composite trait with 18 classes.
