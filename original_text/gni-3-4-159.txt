Abstract 
The  Korean  Twin  Register  (n=154,783  pairs)  was 
reported  in  2002  as  the  first  nationwide  twin  study  in 
Korea and the largest study in  Asia. The Twin  Register 
has  the  information  of  disease  outcomes  since  1990, 
and  basic clinical  and questionnaire data from  biennial 
health  examination  provided  by  Korea  National  Health 
Service. The author attempted to calculate some of the 
genetic parameters of cancers in this population. Common 
cancers  in  Korea  known  to  have  familial  aggregation 
(colon and breast) and cancers of which familial aggregation 
is  unclear  (stomach  cancer)  were  examined  for  their 
familial  recurrence  risks.  There  were  699  stomach 
cancers, 438 breast and 491  colorectal cancers cases in 
the twin register between 1991  and 2003. Like-sex twins 
showed  recurrence  risks (A.LS)  of 5.1  (95% Cl  3.7- 6.9) 
for stomach cancers, 15.5 (95% Cl 1 0.9-20.2) for female 
breast cancers,  and 28.1  (95% Cl  23.5-34.4) for colon 
cancers.  Colorectal  cancers  of  female  like-sex  twins 
show  significantly  higher  familial  recurrence  risk  40.7 
(95% Cl 34.6-47.4), suggesting higher genetic contribution 
in  women  than  in  men.  The  results  show  increased 
familial  risks  compared  with  previous  studies  from  the 
same  register  and  are  largely  compatible  with  other 
studies. The data of the Twin Register could be used for 
estimating population  level  genetic parameters, as well 
as base of the various studies.

Introduction 
There  is  growing  body  of  evidence  that  a  range  of 
environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to the 
etiology of cancers. In addition, epigenetic mechanisms,

such as imprinting and DNA methylation are also known 
to  be  involved  (Shields  and  Harris,  1991;  Feinberg, 
2004).  Efforts to elucidate the genetic cause of cancers 
have  continued,  to  successfully find  genetic variations 
responsible for certain familial cancers: BRCA 1, BRCA2, 
genes for familial adenornatous polyposis (FAP), attenuated 
familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP),  and hereditary 
non-polyposis  colorectal  cancer  (HNPCC),  (Varesco, 
2004;  Jo  and  Chung,  2005).  And  molecular  genetic 
studies to characterize discovered genetic variations are 
underway.  These  rare  genetic variations are  known  to 
have high penetrance, so that almost 100% of those who 
carry the  genetic variation  would  develop the cancers. 
However, in general population, carriers of those genetic 
variations are very rare,  and even among the breast or 
colorectal  cancer  patients,  those  genes  comprise  less 
than 3-10% (Varesco, 2004; Jo and Chung, 2005). Genetic 
variations with  high  penetrance,  but low frequency can 
only  explain  small  proportion  of  total  cancers.  This, 
however, does not necessarily imply that environments 
are overwhelming cause of cancers,  as was previously 
advocated  (Fearon,  1997).  So far,  the  roles  of genetic 
variations  with  high  frequency  and  low  penetrance, 
recessively transmitted genes, and oncogenes expressed 
as  a  consequence  of  sequential  genetic  actions  are 
largely unknown (Feinberg, 2004; Lichtenstein et at., 2000). 
It is one of the first tasks of genomic epidemiology, to 
assess  a  parameter  which  can  quantitate  the  overall 
genetic  contribution  to  carcinogenesis.  Knowledge  of 
quantitative  genetic  contribution  permits  strategy  to 
screen  diseases/traits which  have better opportunity to 
find  underlying  genetic  variations.  For  example,  if  the 
overall  genetic  parameter  suggests  major  gene  or 
oligogenic involvement, there should be  higher chance 
of detecting it, than the case where polygenic involvement 
with tiny influences are interacting with environments. 

Overall genetic contribution is estimated by heritability 
or familial recurrence risk. Unlike cardiovascular diseases 
or traits  related  to  metabolic  syndrome,  heritability  or 
familial  recurrence  risk  was  difficult  to  estimate  for 
cancers,  and  often could  not be  measured  in  classical 
family based studies (Aarino, et at., 1999). Studies using 
twins,  however,  have  been  have  been  successful  in 
estimating overall genetic contribution to cancers (Sung 
eta/., 2002). 

Several  cancers  are  reported  to  have  familial

aggregations;  breast  colorectal  ovarian  and  prostate 
cancers. In Korea, the age-standardized incidence rate of 
breast colorectal ovarian and prostate cancers were 21.7 
forwomen,  27.3 for men and  16.7 for women,  4.94 for 
women,  and 7.88 for men,  out of 100,000 person year, 
respectively.  Compared with the incidences of western 
countries,  those of ovarian cancer and prostate cancer 
are much lower in Korea, as most Asian countries. Breast 
and colorectal cancers also show lower incidences, but 
those are one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in 
Korea.  On  the other hand,  stomach  cancers,  the  most 
common  malignancy  in  Korea  (65. ?for  men,  25.7  for 
women per 100,000 person years) does not show strong 
familial aggregation. In the study, the author attempted to 
compare the parameters of genetic contribution among 
the  common  cancers  in  Korean  population;  breast, 
colorectal, and stomach cancers. So far, there have been 
only a few reports about the overall genetic contribution 
to breast and  colorectal  cancers and  most of them are 
reports in western populations (Fearon, 1997; Aarino,  et 
a/.,  1999; Lichtenstein eta/., 2000). 

The  author  and  other  collaborators  have  been 
organizing the Korean Twin Registry which has 154,783 
pairs  of twins,  and  63,666  pairs  of  adult  twins  among 
them. And the registry is linked to the medical utilization, 
death  certificate,  and  cancer  registry  data since  1992, 
resulting  in  more  than  12 years  of  cancer  occurrence 
follow-up (Sung eta/., 2002). The registry, with information 
on  twins,  and  a  range  of  disease  outcomes  allows  to 
level  genetic  parameters.  For 
estimate  population 
relatively common diseases, it was possible to demonstrate 
preliminary results (Sung eta/., 2002). In the study, with 
longer follow-up period, the author attempted to estimate 
more reliable genetic parameter from large twin registry 
which can  represent general population. 

Methods 
Subjects 
Total  of 63,666 adult twin  pairs  more than  30  years of 
age,  were  analyzed.  The  details  of  the  Korean  Twin 
Registry were described in previous report (Sung eta/., 
2002).  In  the  register,  disease outcomes  are  followed 
since  1990s.  Cancer  occurrence  was  identified  from 
three  data  sources:  national  cancer  registry,  medical 
utilization  of  National  Health  Insurance,  and  cause  of 
death report data. 

To estimate population level prevalence, which is an 
independent parameter for calculating familial recurrence 
risk, a normative cohort representing Korean population 
was used. The normative cohort was reconstructed from 

Korean  National  Health  Service database,  by stratified 
and random sampling one fortieth of all  Koreans.  Strata 
for sampling included 1) age group by 5 years 2) sex 3) 
province  level  geographical  area  4)  type  of  health 
insurance.  The  cohort  was  over-sampled  for  elderly 
persons to stabilize estimated epidemiologic parameters 
such as prevalence and  incidence rate.  The  normative 
cohort was reconstructed to estimate a global burden of 
disease and death, and various descriptive epidemiologic 
parameters  had  been  calculated  from  the  cohort.  The 
cohort  consists  of  1 ,205,470  persons.  All  medical 
utilization  of  the  cohort  members  between  the  year of 
1995 and 2002 were linked.  After the data linkage, any 
information that can identify individuals was deleted.

Case definition 
All  cancers  occurring  after  1991  were  included  in  this 
analysis.  The  following  codes 
International 
Statistical  Classification  of  Diseases,  9th  and  1Oth 
Revision  (ICD-9  and  ICD-1 0)  were  used  to  identify 
cancers:  stomach  cancer  (151  as  ICD-9  and  C16  as 
ICD-10), breast cancer (174 as ICD-9, C50 as ICD-10), 
and colorectal cancer (C18-C21  as ICD-1 0,  153-154 as 
ICD-9).  Operational  definitions  for  cancer  cases  were 
made to reduce spurious diagnosis. The disease code in 
the  medical  utilization  data are often  made just to rule 
out  the  diagnosis  rather  than  to  treat  the  confirmed 
diseases.  While cases  in  cancer  registry  data were all 
confirmed  cases  often  with  pathologic  diagnosis,  the 
cases in medical utilization data, as they are, can inflate 
the epidemiologic parameters. The operational definition 
of cancer cases used in the study was 1) any case in the 
cancer  registry  data,  2)  any  case  only  found  in  both 
medical  utilization  and  death  certificate  data  3)  cases 
only  found  in  the  medical  utilization  data,  which  were 
reported  more 
the  same  primary 
diagnosis,  and admitted more than once with the same 
primary diagnosis.  4)  any cases only found  in  medical 
utilization data, which were found more than three times 
with the same primary diagnosis, and at least one of the 
diagnosis  was  reported  from  general  hospitals.  The 
accuracy of diagnosis for all three cancers was considered 
to the same, and the operational definitions were applied 
to all three cancers. The effective follow-up period used 
in the study differed by the data sources; cancer registry 
data was available between the year of 1992 and 2001, 
medical utilization data 1991-2003, and death certificate 
data 1991-2002.

In the study, it was reasonable to assume there is no 
ascertainment  bias,  and  familial  recurrence  risks  were 
calculated by the casewise concordance rate (formula 3) 
over  prevalence  of  general  population  (formula  1). 
Because  the  familial  recurrence  risk  is  a  function  of 
specific  family  relationship,  rather  than  generalized 
measurement,  it  is  denoted A with  subscript  indicating 
the particular relationship; AS for a recurrence risk of the

Population Prevalence 
In  conventional  epidemiology,  prevalence  is  measured 
as  a  unit  of  person  and  year.  In  contrast,  the  genetic 
concept  of  prevalence  implies  lifetime  risk  of  the 
diseases. In the study, prevalence was measured for all 
the cases during the overall follow-up period ( 1995-2003), 
without  taking  the  time  span  into  account.  However, 
since the follow-up period for estimating population level 
prevalence (=denominator, 1995-203) and concordance 
rate within twin pairs (=nominator, maximum 1991-2003) 
does not agree, the prevalence was adjusted by a factor 
which  was  calculated  from  the  ratio  of  two  follow-up 
periods.  Follow-up  period  was  re-examined  during  the 
study  to  define  effective  follow-up  period,  where  the 
completeness of data sources are satisfactory, by graphical 
comparisons. 

Results 
The  prevalences  of  selected  cancers  were  162.9  for 
men  and  98.6  for  women  (stomach),  121.0  (breast, 
women),  and  76.8  for  men  and  60.5  for  women 
(colorectal)  out of 100,000 person-year,  after adjusting 
for  the  correction  factor  of  1 .32  which  was  calculated 
form two effective follow-up periods of 8.2 and 1 0.8 years. 
Actually estimated prevalence and adjusted prevalence 
was demonstrated in Table 1. By applying the operational 
definition of the study (see the method), the total number 
of estimated cancer cases fell by 1/3 compared with the 
total  cases  in  the  data  sources.  Fig.1  shows  the 
difference between total cases and cases that fell in the 
operational definition when the first occurrence of each 
individual was plotted along the follow-up period. 

Defined  cancer  cases  were  calculated  pairwisely, 
with  discrimination  of  like-sex  and  opposite-sex  twin

pairs. Each like-sex and opposite-sex pairs were further 
divided into male-male pairs and female-female pairs for 
like-sex twins, and then once again subdivided according 
to their disease occurrence; both affected I one affected I 
none  affected  (like-sex),  both  affected I male affected I 
female  affected  I  none  affected  (opposite-sex).  There 
were 4, 7,  and 8 concordantly affected like-sex twins for 
stomach,  breast  and  colorectal  cancers,  while  none 
concordantly affected pairs of opposite-sex twins (Table 
2). There were total  of 699 stomach cancer, 438 breast 
cancer,  and  491  colorectal  cancer cases,  which  fell  in 
the operational case definition of the study. 

Familial  recurrence risk for opposite-sex twins could 
not be calculated owing to lack of concordantly affected 
pairs. The familial recurrence risk for like-sex twins (ALs) 
were estimated to be 6.5 (men, 95% Cl 4.0-9.9) and 5.1 
(women,  95%  Cl  3. 7  - 6.9)  for  stomach  cancer,  15.5 
(95% Cl 1 0.9-20.2) for female breast cancer, 18.4 (men, 
95% Cl12.6-25.1) and 40.7 (women, 95% Cl34.6-47.4) 
for colorectal  cancer (Table 3).  This means,  if one twin 
was affected above cancers the co-twin  has increased 
risks  by  the  factor  of  the  familial  recurrence  risk 
compared with that of the general  population.  Stomach 
cancer did not demonstrate significant sex difference in 
the familial recurrence risk. However, for colorectal cancer, 
the  familial  recurrence  risk  in  women  was  significantly 
greater than that of men.

Because  J\  is  a  parameter  which  is  determined  by 
both the concordance rate and the population prevalence, 
if  the  disease  has  high  prevalence, 
the  value  is 
underestimated.  A  logarithmic  scale  of  J\  values  were 
plotted  against the  logarithm of prevalence,  which  can 
directly show the position in terms of heritability (Fig. 2). 
Breast  cancer  of  women  showed  less  genetic  effects 
than colorectal cancer in  terms of J\,  but breast cancer 
and  colorectal  cancers  demonstrated  same  level  of 
genetic contribution when they were plotted logarithmic 
scale,  implying similar level of heritability. However, the 
absolute level of heritability in  Fig.  2 can not be applied, 
since the familial  recurrence  risks were measured from 
like-sex twins not from siblings. 

Discussion 
Familial recurrence risk 
Familial  recurrence  risk  it  self  was  not  new,  but  first 
introduced  to  the  linkage  analysis  to  discover  genetic 
variation in  1990 by Risch (Cavalli-Sforza,  1978; Risch, 
1990a). The parameter is particularly useful for common 
complex diseases when the mode of transmission is not 
understood, or when the penetrance is very low. Familial 
recurrence  risk  ("A)  differs  from  classical  heritability  in 
several points; Familial recurrence risk ("A)  is dependent 
on  the  specific familial  relationship  while  heritability  is 
not, J\ can be calculated given specific family relationship 
and population data while heritability need at least more 
than two different family relationships to be measured, J\ 
represents two genetic parameters -frequency of genetic 
variation  (as prevalence in  general  population) and the 
effect  size  of  the  genetic  variation  while  heritability  is 
determined  by  the  relative 
influence  of  genetic  and 
environmental contributions. J\ can be exaggerated when 
the  prevalence  of  the  disease  is  low,  underestimated 
when  it  is  high.  The  logarithmic  plotting  in  Fig.  2  can 
linearly indicate relative genetic position between the J\ 
and heritability. However, the reference heritability levels 

are for A8 (familial recurrence risk of siblings) and not for 
A1WIN, each heritability value of cancers only has relative 
meanings to each others (Cavalli-Sforza, 1978). Against 
this background, we cannot exactly estimate heritabilities 
of  selected  cancers  but  relative  order  of  them,  which 
show  similar  level  of  heritability  between  colorectal 
cancer and breast cancer, higher heritability for colorectal 
cancer of women, and lower heritability for stomach cancer. 
Familial recurrence risk is a parameter which is needed 
for  non-parametric  linkage  analysis.  In  non-parametric 
linkage  analysis  or  penetrance-model  free 
linkage 
analysis, identity by descent (IBD) value is calculated to 
examine the  specific  effect of markers,  and  J\  value  is 
used  for  estimating  overall  genetic  effects.  Although 
classical  parametric  linkage  analysis  has  been  very 
powerful to detect genetic variations of Mendelian diseases/ 
traits,  IBD-based  linkage methods  better suit for  many 
common complex diseases.  Given that linkage studies 
are still powerful and useful study for common complex 
human  disease,  and  IBD-based linkage methods have 
higher flexibilities and more power in many cases (Klein 
eta/., 2005; Edwards eta/., 2005), genomic epidemiologic 
parameters like J\ in Korean population can be used as a 
future reference of various genetic studies. 

In the study J\ of like-sex twins are determined by J\ of 
both  mor;~ozygotic twins  and  dizygotic  twins,  however 
considering that monozygotes were majority the results 
should  be  close  to  J\  of  monozygotes.  J\  of  dizygotic 
twins  can  be  a  maximal  expected  value  of  As.  If  J\  of 
monozygotic  twins  are  compared  with  "As,  it  can  give 
clues  about  the  underlying  genetic  mechanism  and 
number of genes involved. 

Comparison with previous studies 
Most  of the  genetic parameters  of cancers  have  been

study of Lichtenstein et at.,  the prevalences of cancers 
are as much as ten times lower in this study. In addition, 
the concordance rate of each cancers are also lower so 
that  stomach  cancer  showed  a  sixth  to  eighth,  breast 
cancer a fifth to seventh, and colorectal cancer a forth to 
fifth  (rnonozygote  and  dizygote).  The  difference  of  the 
parameters  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  1) 
difference  in  the  incidence  of  each  cancers,  2)  the 
average age of the subjects in  Korean Twin  Registry is 
younger  than  that  of  the  European  study  so  that  the 
concordance  rate  could  have  been  underestimated,  3) 
Relatively conservative operational definition of cancers 
used in the study, 4) the use of like-sex twins rather than 
exact  monozygotic  or  dizygotic  twins  in  the  study.  A 
values were estimated  to  be  larger by 2-2.5 for  breast 
and  colorectal  cancers  but  less  for  stomach  cancer, 
mainly because the smaller population prevalence. 

Stomach cancer and Colorectal cancer of women 
While the absolute comparisons of A with those of other 
studies can be inappropriate, the relative size of J\ within 
the  study  has  the  meaning.  In  this  context,  stomach 
cancer and colorectal cancer of women showed difference 
compared with other findings. Stomach cancer indicated 
less  genetic  contribution,  while  colorectal  cancer  of 
women showed larger genetic contribution. The difference 

can  be  partially  explained  from  the  difference  in  the 
environmental exposure of stomach cancer risk factors, 
such as the prevalence of H pylori infection, high salt diet 
and smoking rate, etc. which is more prevalent in Korea. 
However,  the  relatively  high  prevalence  of  stomach 
cancer compared  with  the  Western  studies  also could 
have  played  the  role.  The  relative  difference  between 
male  and  female  colorectal  cancers  is  also  new.  The 
men  can  have  more  environmental  risks  of  colorectal 
cancers, such as higher red  meat consumption, alcohol 
intake, and smoking habits.  It should be the next step to 
examine  whether  the  excess  genetic  contribution  in 
women has something to do with hormonal milieu or sex 
difference in the life styles. 

Case definition and prevalence 
Because  this  study  identified  cancer  cases  through 
record  linkage,  we  could  not directly confirm  the case 
except  for  the  cancer  registry  cases.  We  adopted 
operational case definitions to increase the validity of the 
diagnosis.  By  applying  the  operational  case  definition, 
the total cancer cases decreased to one third. While the 
cancer  incidence  is  reported  by  the  National  Cancer 
Registry data, the prevalence of cancers is not reported. 
The  incidence  of  cancers  estimated  by  the  same  case 
definition of the study show 10-28% increase compared 

with  those  reported by cancer registry.  Cancer registry 
data can be underestimated, since it mainly depends of 
the  reports  from  hospitals.  The  record  linkage  of  the 
study was extensive, and it is natural that the incidence 
of  the  study  exceeds  that  of  the  cancer  registry.  The 
prevalence of cancers in this study,  estimated with  the 
same case definition, is thought to reasonably represent 
the true level. 

familial 

recurrence 

Conclusion 
The  study  estimated 
risks  of 
stomach,  breast,  and  colorectal  cancer  based  on  the 
Korean Twin Registry and a cohort, both of which represent 
Korean populations.  Although zygosity information was 
limited, overall findings were largely compatible with the 
previous studies in Caucasian population.  The relative 
genetic contribution estimated by familial recurrence risk 
showed  increase  in  female  colorectal  cancer  and 
decrease in stomach cancer, which needs to be further 
elucidated. The study shows the potentials of the population 
based  data  sources  to  be  used  to  estimate  genomic 
epidemiology  index,  which  can  be  applied  to  valuable 
parameters in gene discovery study.
