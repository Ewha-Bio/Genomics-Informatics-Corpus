Abstract

Asp66his,  Asp54Lys,  and  Asp50Asn  are  mutations  in 
connexin  26  that  are  observed  in  the  clinic  and  give  rise 
to  autosomal  dominant  syndromes.  They  are  the  result 
of  point  mutations  in  the  human  gap  junction  β-2  gene. 
In  order  to  investigate  the  structural  mechanism  of 
Bart-Pumphrey  Syndrome,  Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness 
Syndrome,  and  Vohwinkel  Syndrome,  homology  model-
ing  was  carried  out.  Asp66  has  direct  contact  with 
Asn62  by  two  hydrogen  bonds  in  the  wild-type  protein, 
and  in  Asp66His,  the  biggest  change  observed  is  a  tre-
mendous  energy  increase  caused  by  hydrogen  bond 
breakage  to  Asn62.  Shifts  in  the  side  chain  and  new  hy-
drogen  bond  formation  are  observed  for  Lys54  com-
pared  to  the  wild-type  protein  (Asn54)  and  result  in  clos-
er  contact  to  Val84.  Asp50Asn  causes  a  significant  de-
crease  in  bond  energy,  and  residual  charge  reversal  re-
pels  the  ion  and  metabolites  and,  hence,  inhibits  their 
transportation.  Such  perturbations  are  likely  to  be  a  fac-
tor  contributing  to  abnormal  functioning  of  ion  channels, 
resulting  cell  death  and  disease.

Introduction

Hearing  impairment  or  hearing  loss  is  a  full  or  partial 
decrease  in  the  ability  to  perceive  sounds,  induced  by 
various  biological  (Tremblay  and  Ross,  2007),  environ-
mental  (Eyken et al.,  2007),  and  genetic  factors.  Various 
dominant  and  recessive  genes  subsist  that  induce  in-
herited  hearing  impairments  (Laer et al.,  2001).  Kelsell et 
al.  1997  reported  a  GJB2  mutation,  leading  to  hearing

deterioration. 
    The  gap  junction  β-2  gene  (GJB2)  is  situated  on  the 
long  arm  (q  arm)  of  human  chromosome  13  at  a  posi-
tion  between  11  and  12  (Castillo et al.,  2005).  The  GJB2 
gene  encodes  for  the  connexin  protein  (GJB2  protein) 
(Cx26)  (Latting et al.,  2008).  Gap  junction  β-2  protein, 
commonly  known  as  connexin  26  (Cx26),  belongs  to  a 
family  of  structurally  related  transmembrane  proteins 
that  mediate  intracellular  transport  of  various  ions  and 
molecules  (Sosinsky,  1995).  Various  connexin  proteins 
assemble  with  each  other  and  form  gap  junctions.  Gap 
junctions  are  the  clusters  of  intercellular  channels  in-
volved  in  direct  communication  between  cells.  GJB2 
mutations  result  in  altered  protein  sequences.  Alterations 
in  the  protein  sequence  are  the  predominant  cause  of 
inherited,  sensorineural  deafness  (Zelante  et al.,  1997).
    Immunohistochemistry  of  inner  ear  tissues  has  shown 
that  connexin  26  and  connexin  30  colocalize  (Forge  et 
al.,  2002;  Lautermann et al.,  1998).  Connexin  26  has  a 
structural  resemblance  to  innexins  that  form  gap  junc-
tions  in  invertebrates  but  has  quite  a  different  protein 
sequence.  The  molecular  weight  of  connexin  is  about  26 
KDa,  a  product  of  the  GJB2  gene.  Connexin  exists  in  a 
dynamic  cycle  of  synthesis  and  replacement  because  of 
a  short  life  span  of  a  few  hours  (Musil,  et al.,  1993). 
Connexin  26  is  found  in  cells  throughout  the  body,  par-
ticularly  in  the  inner  ear  and  the  skin,  and  permits  the 
transport  of  potassium  ions  and  small  molecules  in 
neighboring  cells  (Castillo  et al.,  2005).  Its  presence  in 
the  cochlea  is  associated  with  hearing. 
    GJB2  mutations  are  the  cause  of  recessive  and  domi-
nant  forms  of  deafness  (Laer et al.,  2001),  affecting  1  in 
1000  children  (Bitner-Glindzicz,  2002).  About  20  muta-
tions  of  gap  junction  β-2  have  been  described  as  be-
ing  related  to  diseases  (Abe  et al.,  2000)  and  various 
syndromes,  such  as  Bart-Pumphrey  Syndrome,  Keratitis- 
Ichthyosis-Deafness  Syndrome,  and  Vohwinkel  Syndrome. 
(Richard  et al.,  2004;  Snoeckx  et al.,  2005;  Yotsumoto 
et al.,  2003).  The  mutations  alter  the  amino  acid  se-
quence  of  connexin  26  and  result  in  impaired  function-
ing  of 
ion  channels, 
especially.  In  fact,  a  range  of  phenotypic  presentations 
of  autosomal  dominant  and  recessive  gap  junction  β-2 
gene  mutations  are  intriguing.  Such  mutations  result  in 
an  unstable  or  malformed  protein,  unable  to  form  gap 
junctions,  or  they  result  in  a  modified  protein  that  builds 
dysfunctional  gap  junctions.  So,  the  falsified  or  modified 
connexin  26  curbs  the  normal  arrangement  of  gap  junc-

the  protein  associated  with

tions  and,  hence,  their  proper  functioning,  affecting  the 
transition  of  sound  waves  to  neural  impulses. 
    So,  the  present  study  was  carried  out  to  highlight  the 
structural  changes,  especially  the  hydrogen  bonding, 
bond  angles,  bond  length,  force  field  energies,  and  PI 
values,  because  such  forces  and  factors  are  considered 
to  be  contributing  to  the  effect  on  amino  acid  residues, 
their  stability,  and  normal  functioning  (Karaguller  et al., 
2004;  Talley  et al.,  2008). 

Structure  of  human  gap  junction  β-2  protein

The  X-ray  crystallographic  structure  of  connexin  26  is 
not  known.  But,  the  protein  sequence  and  basic  protein 
structure  are  known  and  well  characterized  (Fig.  1).

Methods

Homology  modeling

Sequence  Analysis:  The  primary  sequence  of  human 
connexin  26  (primary  accession  no.  P29033)  was  re-
trieved  from  SWISS-Prot  (Bairoch  and  Apweiler,  1997). 
Using in silico  tools,  a  theoretically  designed  homology 
model  (1xir)  was  obtained  from  Protein  Data  Bank 
(PDB).  Homology  modeling  can  be  described  in  four 
steps:  (A)  identification  of  a  homolog  from  PDB  whose 
structure  is  known;  (B)  alignment/positioning  of  our 
query  sequence  to  the  template  or  model  sequence;  (C) 
construction  of  the  replica/model  based  on  the  align-
ment;  and  (D)  entrance  and  refinement  of  the  model.  A

sequence  similarity  of  30%  to  a  known  protein  structure 
being  often  predicted  and  is  equivalent  to  a  low-reso-
lution  X-ray  structure  (Xiang,  2006).  The  3D  coordinates 
of  the  template  used  were  available.

Mutational  studies

By  using  Swiss  Protein  Deep  Viewer,  various  structural 
implementations  were  carried  out  from  the  coordinate 
file  for  the  selected  amino  acids-Asp66His,  Asn54Lys, 
and  Asp50Asn-involved  in  obvious  clinical  syndromes 
(Fig.  1).  Asp66,  Asn54,  and  Asp50  were  mutated  to 
His66,  Asn54,  and  Asp50,  respectively,  and  a  study  was 
carried  out  to  observe  changes  in  hydrogen  bonds, 
bond  lengths,  angles,  and  rotations.  Energy  calculations 
for  wild-type  and  mutated  amino  acids  were  made  by 
using  the  GROMOSS96  implementation  of  the  Swiss 
Protein  Deep  Viewer.  The  PI  values  of  the  individual  ami-
no  acid  residues,  wild-type  and  mutant,  were  compared 
on  the  basis  of  an  available  table  (Williams et al.,  1987).

Results

In  nature,  a  protein  is  stabilized  by  protein  folds  into 
one  or  more  specific  conformations  to  perform  bio-
logical  functions.  The  specific  conformations  are  driven 
by  various  interactions,  such  as  hydrogen  bonding, 
bond  angles,  and  various  forces.  The  226  amino  acids 
of  connexin  26  are  known.  The  3D  structure  of  connexin 
26  is  well  known  and  was  obtained  from  Protein  Data 
Bank.  Mutations  in  the  gap  junction  β-2  gene  cause  a 
substitution  of  different  amino  acids  of  connexin  26  and 
result  in  various  syndromes.  In  the  present  work,  3  ami-
no  acids  of  the  E1  domain  of  the  protein  were  selected 
to  determine  the  characteristic  changes  affecting  the 
physiology  of  connexin  26  (Fig.  2).

Asp66His

Asp66His  causes  a  hydrogen  bond  breakage  to  Asn62 
(Table  1),  resulting  in  a  significant  increase  in  energy  for 
bonds  (18.494  KJ/mol  for  mutant  compared  to  5.516 
KJ/mol  for  wild-type).  The  angular  energy  increased  by 
2.457  KJ/mol  for  His66.  The  CG1-CB1  rotation  for  His66 
changed  the  CA1-CB1-CG1  angle  from  108.76o  for  the 
wild-type  to  115.05o  for  the  mutated  amino  acid  (Table 
drogen  bond  (2.67 Å)  to  Asn62  (Fig.  2A,  2B).  The  ar-

(CD1-CB1  distance,  4.98 Å  for  wild-type  to  CE11-CG1 
4.06 Å bond  length  for  the  mutation).  Another  important 

omatic  ring  of  His66  reduces  the  distance  to  Pro70 

change  observed  is  the  shift  in  normal  charges  of  the 
residue  from  negative  to  positive,  with  the  increase  in  PI

value  from  2.77  to  7.59.  But,  the  shift  in  hydrogen 
bonding  is  enough  to  play  a  considerable  role  in  affect-
ing  the  normal  interaction  of  protein  residues  and,  ulti-
mately,  the  overall  charge  of  ion  channels  and  their  in-
teractions  with  ions  and  metabolites  associated  with 
transportation  functioning.

Asn54Lys

The  high-molecular-weight  (114)  polar  amino  acid  aspar-

agine  affects  the  structure  of  proteins  in  a  highly  specif-
ic  manner  by  providing  a  strong  driving  force  for  folding. 
Moreover,  it  possesses  interesting  hydrogen  bond  prop-
erties  that  resemble  the  backbone  peptides.  A  missense 
mutation,  Asn54Lys,  causes  hydrogen  bond  breakage  to 

Leu56  (3.12 Å)  and  Thr55  (3.05 Å)  (Fig.  2C,  2D).  The 

hydrogen  bond  breakage  results  in  a  shift  in  tortional 
energy  (4.702  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  to  7.002  kJ/mol  for 
mutant)  and  a  tremendous  decrease  in  electrostatic  po-
tential  energy  by  37.5  kJ/mol  (52.92  kJ/mol  for  wild-type

to  15.42  kJ/mol  for  the  mutation),  along  with  a  decrease 
in  energy  for  bonds  (7.729  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  to  5.777 
for  mutant)  and  angles  (1.841  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  and 
1.421  kJ/mol  for  mutant)  (Table  1  &  2).  The  additional 
methyl  groups  (CD1  and  CE1)  of  the  mutant  Lys54  side 
chain,  compared  to  the  wild-type  Asn54  residue,  results 
in  much  closer  contact  with  the  adjacent  Val84  side 

chain  (2.98  Å  for  mutant  compared  to  4.21  Å  for 
wild-type)  and  forms  a  new  hydrogen  bond  (2.39 Å)  to 

the  carbonyl  group  of  Ser113  (Fig.  2C,  2D).  The 
changes  significantly  decrease  the  electrostatic  energy 
with  a  minimal  change  in  CA1-CB1-CG1  bond  angle 
(109.53o  to  109.54o)  but  increase  the  energy  of  the 
whole  protein  considerably  from  6,946.490  kJ/mol  for 
wild-type  to  7,316.498  kJ/mol  for  the  mutated  protein 
(Table  2).  In  addition,  a  connexin  26  mutation,  Asn54  to 
Lys,  shifts  the  interaction  from  114  Glu  to  the  CA  and 
CG  atoms  of  the  protein's  polar  amino  acid  residue  110 
Glu  at  a  cutoff  score  of  2  with  an  additional  increase  in 
PI  value  from  5.41  for  wild-type  to  9.47  for  the  mutated 
residue  and  a  charge  reversal  from  a  neutral  to  basic 
residue  with  a  strong  positive  charge.  The  positively 
charged  residue  repels  the  positive  ions  and  metabolites 
and  thus  impairs  trafficking  through  ion  channels  of 
connexin  proteins.  A  decrease  in  signal  for  the  next 
pathway  causes  syndromes  and  hearing  impairment. 

Asp50Asn

Mutations  leading  to  Asp50Asn  apparently  do  not  affect 
peptide  bonds  or  hydrogen  bonding  (Fig.  2E,  2F)  but 
significantly  rotate  the  CA1-CB1-CG1  bond  angle  from 
105.45o  for  wild-type  to  111.17o  for  the  mutated  protein. 
The  CG1-CB1  rotation  cause  a  tremendous  decrease  in 
energy  for  bonds  (63.585  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  to  6.228 
kJ/mol  for  mutant),  and  electrostatic  energy  decreases 
by  3.3  kJ/mol  (11.46  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  to  8.16k/mol 
for  the  mutant)  with  an  overall  decrease  in  the  energy 
of  the  protein  from  6946.490  kJ/mol  to  6811.053  kJ/mol 
(Table  2). 
the  connexin  26  mutation 
Asp50Asn  results  in  a  considerable  increase  in  PI  value 
from  2.77  in  the  wild-type  to  5.41  for  the  mutated 
residue.  This  inhibits  the  Van  der  Waals  interaction  of 
the  OD1  and  OD2  atoms  of  the  Asp50  side  chains  to 
the  backbone  oxygen  atom  of  Glu47  at  a  cutoff  score 
of  2.  Alterations  in  atomic  interaction  and  a  charge  re-
versal  from  negative  to  neutral  result  in  impaired  traffick-
ing  of  positive  ions  and  metabolites,  such  as  calcium 
and  potassium  ions,  with  reduced  transportation  and 
signaling  to  the  next  pathways  and,  ultimately,  cell 
death.

Discussion

The  long  arm  of  human  chromosome  13  holds  a  very 
important  gene,  GJB2,  related  to  proper  hearing  (Castillo 
et al.,  2005).  The  gene  GJB2  translates  into  the  con-
nexin  protein,  which  belongs  to  the  connexin  family  in 
vertebrates.  One  of  the  proteins,  connexin  26,  tran-
scribed  by  the  gap  junction  β-2  gene,  belongs  to  a 
group  of  structurally  similar  trans-proteins  that  assemble 
each  other  and  form  gap  junctions  (Soninsky,  1995). 
This  protein  is  colocalized  to  connexin  30  and  permits 
the  transfer  of  ions  and  small  molecules  in  their  ad-
jacent  cells.  In  such  a  way,  the  protein  couples  the  vari-
ous  cells  both  metabolically  and  electrically  and  main-
tains  the  cellular  homeostasis  (Mahasneh  and  Battah, 
2006).  Connexin  26  mutations  are  the  cause  of  non-
syndromic  recessive  and  dominant  forms  of  hearing  im-
pairment  (Kelsell  et al.,  1997).  A  point  mutation  at  nu-
cleotide  162  in  codon  54  changes  C  to  A.  This  sub-
stitution  leads  to  the  replacement  of  the  evolutionarily 
conserved  asparagine  54  to  an  electronegatively  charg-
ed  lysine  in  the  first  expended  loop  of  connexin  26 
(Richard  et al.,  2004).  The  resultant  mutation  destroys 
the  hydrogen  bond  from  the  amide  group  of  Leu56  (Fig. 
2D).  Additional  methyl  groups  of  Leu54  extend  to 
Ser113,  and  the  carbonyl  group  of  Ser113  shares  a  hy-
drogen  bond  with  the  Lys54  amide  group  (Fig.  2D). 
Such  subtle  changes  alter  the  energy  of  the  whole  pro-
tein  from  6946.490  kJ/mol  to  7316.498  kJ/mol  (Table  2). 
These  changes  might  be  involved  in  reducing  the  ex-
pression  of  connexin  26,  causing  Kunckle  pads  and  leu-
konychia  (Bart  et al.,  1967).  Affected  family  members 
suffer  from  thickened  skin  of  the  palms  and  soles  in 
early  childhood  (Richard  et al.,  2004).  The  mutation 
Asn54Lys  disturbs  the  hydrogen  bonds  and  seems  to 
be  a  contributing  factor  toward  reduced  epidermal  ex-
pression  of  connexin  26,  also  involved  in  Bart-Pumphrey 
Syndrome  (Richard  et al.,  2004). 
    The  dominant  point  mutation  of  gap  junction  β-2, 
causing  Asp50Asn,  significantly  reduces  the  energy  for 
bonds  (63.585  kJ/mol  for  wild-type  to  6.228  kJ/mol  for 
mutant).  The  CB1-CG1  bond  rotation  affects  the  angle 
(105.45o  for  wild-type  to  111.17o  for  mutant)  and  the  de-
crease  in  the  force  field  energy  of  the  protein  from 
6946.490  kJ/mol  to  6811.053  kJ/mol  (Table  2).  The  sub-
stitution  of  the  conserved  residue  aspartic  acid  50  by 
asparagine  (Asp50Asn)  in  the  first  extracellular  domain 
of  connexin  26  causes  Keratitis-Ichthyosis-Deafness 
Syndrome  (Yotsumoto  et al.,  2003).  This  mutation  is 
likely  to  be  the  factor  that  disturbs  the  communication 
of  ions,  metabolites,  and  signaling  molecules  in  neigh-
boring  cells  and  affects  homeostasis  by  disturbing  the 
bonding  and  energies  (Saez  et al.,  2000).  Charge  re-
versal  and  the  reduced  distance  of  His66  to  Pro70  due 

to  Asp66His  alter  the  normal  protein  bonding  (Fig.  2B), 
causing  Vohwinkel  syndrome  (Snoeckx  et al.,  2005). 
This  might  result  in  impaired  trafficking  of  connexin  26, 
its  assembly  with  other  proteins,  and  docking  with  ad-
jacent  cells  (Maestrini,  et al.,  1999;  Marziano,  et al., 
2003).  Normally,  connexin  assembles  at  the  planer  of 
the  plasma  membrane  involved  in  the  formation  of  the 
gap  junction  plaque.  Asp66His  enlarges  the  CA1-CB1- 
CG1  angle  from  108.76o  to  115.05o.  Such  factors  might 
be  involved  in  contributing  to  the  plane  of  connexin  26, 
disturbing  the  members  of  the  whole  connexin  unit, 
which  ultimately  affects  membranous  communication 
and  results  in  hearing  loss  and  skin  diseases.

Conclusion

Connexin  26  is  an  important  protein  involved  in  normal 
hearing.  Mutations  affect  the  protein's  function  by  dis-
turbing  the  associated  factors.  However,  similar  to  vari-
ous  other  proteins,  normal  functioning  of  connexin  26  is 
associated  with  a  range  of  factors.  Hydrogen  bonding, 
residual  energies,  atomic  angles,  and  residual  charges 
are  the  main  contributing  factors  that  affect  ion  chan-
nels  and  their  transportation.  This  significant  increase  in 
PI  value  is  an  additional  cause  of  charge  reversal  of 
amino  acid  residues,  which  repels  ions  and  metabolites 
and  their  passage  through  ion  channels,  inhibiting  the 
next  signaling  pathway  and  causing  syndromes.  So,  this 
study  could  be  used  as  a  reference  for  establishing  a 
mechanism  that  could  inhibit  the  repletion  of  ions  and 
metabolites  but  push  them  back  on  their  normal  track.
