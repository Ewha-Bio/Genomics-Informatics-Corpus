Abstract 
RAN-aCGH is an R GUI tool for the analysis and visualization 
of array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) 
experiments. The tool consists of data-loading, preprocessing 
for missing data, several methods for statistical identification 
of DNA copy number aberration, and visualization of the copy 
number change. RAN-aCGH requires a single input format, 
provides various visualizations, and allows the addition of 
a new statistical method, all in a user-friendly graphic user 
interface (GUI). 

Availabl1ity: RAN-aCGH (Windo\NS, Mac OS) is freely available 
for academic researchers. http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/BSKimlab/

Ke}'IM)Ids:  array-CGH, R GUI, copy number aberration 

Introduction 
DNA copy number aberrations are key genetic events in 
the  development  and  progression  of  various  human 
cancers (Pollack et at., 2002). Array comparative genomic 
hybridization (array-CGH) technology has been recently 
developed,  and  it  allows  us  to  measure  aberrations 
pertaining  to  DNA  copy  number  changes  at  tens  of 
thousands  of  chromosomal  loci  simultaneously.  The 
array-CGH is used to search for chromosomal regions of 
gain,  loss,  amplification,  or  deletion  related  to  cancer 
development and recurrence. The purpose of array-CGH 
analysis is to divide the whole genome into segments such 
that  the  copy  number  differs  between  contiguous 
segments and subsequently to quantify the copy number 
in each segment (Pinkel et at.,  1998; Jong et at., 2004).

Recently,  several  statistical  methods  have  been 
developed for the  analysis of array-CGH  experiments. 
These are aCGH-Smooth (Jong eta/., 2004), CBS (Oishen 
eta/., 2004 ), GLAD (Hupe et at., 2004 ),  HMM (Fridlyand 
et at., 2004 ), CGHseg (Picard eta/., 2005), CLAC (Wang 
et  a/.,  2005),  Lasso-based  penalized  least  squares 
regression (Huang et at., 2005), Wavelet (Hus eta/., 2005), 
and  a  spatially-correlated  mixture  model  (Broet  and 
Richardson, 2006). Many analysis tools are available in 
the  MATLAB toolbox or in  R packages in  Bioconductor 
(http://www.bioconductor.org)  or the  R-Project website 
(http://www.r-project.org). However, those are provided 
only with simple visualization and a few statistical methods 
for  identifying  aberrations  of  chromosomal  regions. 
Biologists may find it difficult to employ a subset of these 
methods due to their inconsistent input format and different 
preprocessing steps. 

In this study, RAN-aCGH (Fig. 1) has been developed 
for the analysis of array-CGH experiments. RAN-aCGH is 
built  on  the  open-source  R  software  and  provides  a 
user-friendly interface. The RAN-aCGH interface consists 
of data loading, preprocessing, choosing methods, and a 
window with a scroll bar showing software parameters that 
a user can  choose. The advantage of RAN-aCGH is its 
single input format through which  one can  process the 
preprocessing steps and run several statistical analyses 
to completion with just a few clicks. It provides various plots 
of DNA copy  number change  and  one  can  add  a new 
statistical method to it. 

Components of RAN-aCGH 
Data Loading 
The  input  dataset to  be  processed  should  be  given  in 
tab-delimited text files. Chromosome mapping information 
of  genes  and  postnormalization  data  of  array-CGH 
experiments can be uploaded as two independent files. The 
data file consists of a header line explaining information and 
sample  name  by  column.  Detailed  information  on  the 
data.txt  and 
info.txt  is  available  in  the  manual  at 
http://web. yonsei .a c. kr/BSKimlab/Public _paper.htm. 

Preprocessing 
For the imputation of missing values, we implement the 

138  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  5(3) 137-139, September 2007 

preprocessing steps that consist of no missing proportion 
(NMP) and imputation. The NMP of a gene is defined as 
the proportion of valid observations out of the total number 
of samples  (Kim  eta/., 2005).  We  can  impute  missing 
values  for  each  chromosome  using  the  k-nearest 
neighbors (K-NN) algorithm (Troyanskaya eta/., 2001 ). 
The preprocessing has default values of 80% for NMP and 
k=1 0 for K-NN.  The R package impute is used for K-NN. 

Methods 
The RAN-aCGH includes almost all the methods that have 
been proposed in R packages. These include a circular 
binary segmentation (CBS) method (Oishen eta/., 2004), 
unsupervised  hidden  Markov  model  (HMM)  approach 
(Fridlyand  eta/., 2004),  gain and  loss analysis of DNA 
(GLAD) using adaptive weights smoothing (AWS) (Hupe 
et al., 2004), cluster along chromosomes (CLAC) method 
using the hierarchical clustering algorithm (Wang eta/., 
2005), a penalized least squares regression (Huang eta/., 
2005), and the wavelet approach (Hsu eta/., 2005).  For 
implementing these statistical methods in RAN-aCGH, the 
DNAcopy,  GLAD,  clac,  Iars,  waves/im,  cluster,  splines,

Results and Discussion 
One can click the "Go!" button after loading the data set, 
select preprocessing parameters such as NMP proportion 
and  a  k value  for  K-NN,  and  finally  choose  statistical 
methods (Fig. 1 ). RAN-aCGH returns preprocessing and 
statistical methods that are chosen by the user in a small 
window (Fig.  1 ).  Output files are automatically saved as 
text format files. 

We noted that most of the statistical methods proposed 
for  detecting  copy  number  aberrations  were  run  as 
web-based tools, such as MA TLAB toolbox or R packages. 
However, these tools have their own input formats, which 
are  quite different from  one  another.  Furthermore,  one 
must learn MA TLAB or R to run these tools. Biologists may 
find it difficult to employ a subset of these methods due to 
their inconsistent input format and different preprocessing 
steps.  RAN-aCGH features single input format of input 
data files and user-friendly GUI with a few mouse clicks. 
Furthermore, users can add new statistical methods into 
RAN-aCGH.
