Abstract 

We  present a  latent variable  model-based approach 
to the analysis of gene expression  patterns,  coupled 
with  topographic clustering.  Aspect model,  a  latent 
variable  model for dyadic data,  is applied to extract 
latent patterns under1ying complex variations of gene 
expression  levels.  Then  a  topographic  clustering  is 
performed  to find  coherent groups of genes,  based 
on the extracted  latent patterns as well  as individual 
gene expression  behaviors.  Applied  to  cell  cycle(cid:173)
regulated  genes  of the  yeast  Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae,  the  proposed  method  could  discover 
biologically  meaningful  patterns  related  with 
characteristic  expression  behavior in  particular cell 
cycle phases.  In  addition, the display of the variation 
in  the composition  of these  latent patterns on the 
cluster map provided more facilitated interpretation of 
the resulting  cluster structure.  From  this,  we argue 
that latent variable models, coupled with topographic 
clustering,  are  a  promising  tool  for explorative 
analysis of gene expression data.

Introduction 

DNA microarrays from eDNA chips or oligonucleotide chips 
provide a global, parallel view on the expression patterns of 
hundreds or thousands of genes in a cell at a specific time, 
under  a  specific experimental  conditions  or  processes 
(Baldi and Hatfield, 2002; Shamir and Sharan, 2002). They 
are  among  the  most powerful  and  versatile  tools  for

functional  genomics,  and  advances  in  technologies  for 
these  high-density  arrays  are  enabling  to  produce 
enormous  amount  of  expression  data.  For the  efficient 
exploration and analysis of these massive microarray data, 
appropriate  analysis  tools  are  needed  which  are  different 
from  conventional  methods for the traditional  one-gene-in(cid:173)
one-experiment paradigm. 

Clustering  is  a  key  step  to  analyzing  gene  expression 
data,  where  genes  are  systematically  grouped  together 
according to their similarity in  expression  patterns.  Among 
the  earliest  and  extensively  used  algorithms  are 
hierarchical  clustering  (Eisen  eta/.,  1998;  Spellman eta/., 
1998;  Scherf eta/.,  2000)  and  k-means  (Herwig  eta/., 
1999;  Tavazoie eta/.,  1999).  Eisen  eta/. (Eisen eta/., 
1998) analyzed the gene expression data of budding yeast 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the hierarchical clustering 
algorithm  and  showed  that  genes  of  known  similar 
functions  were  grouped  together with  the  clustering. 
Tavazoie et a/.  (Tavazoie  et a/.,  1999)  used  the  k-means 
algorithm to identify transcriptional  regulatory sub-networks 
in  yeast.  Despite  their successful  applications  in  many 
other  biological  tasks  as  well  as  these,  however,  the 
algorithms suffer from  some shortcomings, such  as  lack of 
robustness,  incompetence  of proper  handling  of  global 
structure  (hierarchical  clustering)  and  non-structure  in 
resulting  clusters  (k-means  clustering)  (Tamayo et a/., 
1999; Fowlkes eta/., 2002). 

In this paper,  we present an effective approach for gene 
expression  pattern  analysis,  based  on  latent variable 
models and topographic clustering.  Latent variable models 
are  a  powerful  tool  for  discovering  latent  structure 
underlying  data  objects.  They  are  well  suited  to  extract 
correlational  patterns  of variables  and  provide  a compact, 
useful  representation  of  data.  Also,  a  natural  similarity 
metric  between  data can  be  derived  from  latent variable 
models (Jaakkola and  Haussler,  1999; Tsuda eta/., 2002). 
Topographic  clustering  algorithms  such  as  SOM  (self(cid:173)
organizing  maps)  (Kohonen,  1997)  are  an  attractive 
method for providing not only good clustering performance 
but also easy visualization  and  interpretation of the  results 
(Tamayo eta/., 1999; Toronen eta/., 1999). 

We  use an  aspect model that is a latent variable model 
for  co-occurrence  data  to  extract  significant  patterns 
underlying gene expression data.  Using these patterns and 
original  expression  data,  two  cluster  maps  are  produced 
from  a topographic clustering.  In the first map, each cluster 
is  represented  by the  average  expression  levels of genes

terms of its characteristics in convex combinations of latent 
patterns. 
We applied our method to the expression data of cell cycle(cid:173)
regulated  genes  of  the  yeast  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. 
Our results show that the latent patterns discovered by the 
aspect  model  are  well  reflecting  the  characteristic 
expression  behaviors  across  various  cell  cycle  phases. 
Two  independent  cluster  maps  provided  by  topographic 
clustering  are shown  to  be  useful  in  their ability to  provide 
an intuitive,  integrated understanding of complex variations 
of hundreds of genes during the progress of cell cycle. 

Materials and Methods 

Our approach  to  gene  expression  analysis  consists  of 
three  steps:  (1)  identification  of  meaningful  patterns 
inherent  in  gene  expression  data  using  a latent  variable 
model;  (2)  construction  of  a similarity  matrix  containing 
similarity values  of  all  gene  pairs;  (3)  clustering  of  genes 
based on the similarity matrix and  a topographic clustering 
algorithm.  Fig.  1 summarizes  the  overall  procedure  of  our 
approach to gene expression data analysis. 

Latent pattern analysis based on aspect model 
As  the  first  step  to  the  analysis  of  gene  expression  data, 
we use an aspect model (Hofmann, 2001) which  is a latent 
variable  model  for  co-occurrence  data.  Latent  variable 
models  are  a powerful  approach  to  probabilistic  modeling 
where  a set of  observed  variables  are  supplemented  with 
additional  latent  variables  (Bishop,  1999).  Besides  their 
efficiency for density estimation,  the  latent variable models 

are  very  useful  in  discovering  latent structure  underlying  a 
set of data. 
Let D  be  an  N x M  matrix where  M  is the  number of  data 
and  N  is  the  number of  attributes  and  each  element  is 
indexed by (a1,  x.),  (1-:::;i-:::;M,  1-:::;j-:::;N).  In the aspect model, 
the joint probability of P(a1,  x•)  is decomposed by introducing 
a latent class variable zEZ={z1.v.  ···, Zk}, 

P(a1, x;) = P(x,)P(a1 I x;) 

=  P(x)'f.P(a1 I zk)P(zk I xJ 

K 

k=l 

(1) 

This  indicates that  the  conditional  probability  or  sample 
specific  attribute  distribution  P(a1  I x,)is  approximated  by  a 
convex combination  of K aspects P(a1  I ZK).  The goal of the 
modeling  by the aspect model  is to  estimate class-specific 
attribute  distribution  P(a1  I ZK)  and  data  specific  class 
distribution P(Zk  I x,) from data set. 
Formally,  the  aspect  model  is  learned  by  maximizing  the 
log data-likelihood L=logp(D): 

M  N 

L  = 'f.'f.r(a1,x;)IogP(a1,x;), 

i=l  )=1 

(2) 

where  r(a1, x•)  is  the  value  of  a1  in  the  data x,.  The 
Expectation-Maximization  (EM)  algorithm  (Dempster eta/., 
1977) is used to estimate the  parameters maximizing L.  In 
the  E-step,  the  posterior  probabilities  P(z,  I a;,  x,)  are 
computed  and  in  the  M-step,  the  parameters  P(a1  I Zk)  and 
P(z,  I x,)  are  estimated.  These  two  steps  are  iteratively 
alternated until convergence.

Estimating similarity by the fisher kernel 
One of the most important things in clustering algorithms is 
how to  define  (dis)similarity  measure  between  data,  and 
the  choice  is  quite  subjective.  In  kernel  methods  like 
support vector  machines  (Cristianini  and  Shawe-Taylor, 
2000;  Schi:ilkopf  and  Smola,  2001 ),  this  corresponds  to 
selecting an appropriate kemel function. 
Given two data vectors x; and x1 in the input space X,  a valid 
kernel  function  k(x•,  xi)  can  be  represented  as the  inner 
product  between  two  feature  vectors  in  a  (high 
dimensional) feature space F, that is, 

(3) 

where  ¢J 
is  a fixed  mapping from  X to F,  that  is,  ¢J :X---+F. 
The mapping  ¢J  can  be viewed as a preprocessing step to 
draw out meaningful features from data, and the technique 
of kernel function provides an efficient way of inner-product 
calculation  in  the  feature  space F  (Cristianini  and  Shawe(cid:173)
Taylor, 2000; Graepel eta/., 1998). 

In this paper,  we  utilize the kernel function  presented  in 
(Hofmann,  2000),  where  an  intrinsic  kernel,  named  the 
Fisher kernel,  was  derived  from  the  aspect  model.  The 
Fisher  kernel  (Jaakkola  and  Haussler,  1999)  is  an 
approach  to  constructing  kernels  from  generative 
probabilistic  models  and  defines the  similarity  between 
data based  on  information-geometric principles  using  the 
gradient space of the generative model. 

Let  l(x,)  be  the  expected  log-probability of  a sample  x. 
under the aspect model parameterized by O={Ot,  82}  where 
Ot={P(zk)  and  02={P(a,!zk)}.  The  kernel  is  derived  by 
computing  the  Fisher  scores  'Vol (x;)  and  the  Fisher 
information  matrix I (O)=E{'Vel (x)\leT[ (x)}.  With  the  square(cid:173)
root  transformation  of  parameters  8={81. 82}  and  the 
approximation  of I  (0)  as  the  identity  matrix  (Hofmann, 
2000), the kernel from the aspect model is given by 

where 

k(x.,x)  ==  V~l(x;)I(er1 V9 l(x)

Here, Jf({/J,  x,)  in the Equation  (6) is an empirical distribution 
estimated  by  r(a,xJ!l:mr(am,xJ .Eventually,  this  similarity 
metric  is  the  linear summation  of  k1  and  b  with  equal 
weights: k1(Xi,  .x;)  is the similarity in the representation on the 

latent space.  b(x•,  xi)  calculates  the  inner product  of the 
original  two  data  x,  and  xi,  where  products  of  the 
corresponding  attributes  are  weighted  by  the  degree  of 
overlap of respective posterior probabilities (the second line 
in Equation (6)) (Hofmann, 2000). 

Clustering  by  kernel-based  soft topographic 
mapping 
The  kernel-based  soft  topographic  mapping  (STMK) 
(Graepel et a/.  1998)  is  a topographic clustering  algorithm 
based  on  kernel-based  distance  measures  and  principles 
from statistical physics.  It can provide not only a stable and 
good  clustering  algorithm,  but  also  a topographic  map  of 
the clustered  data.  By using a specific kernel function  and 
the  kernel  trick,  the  algorithm  can  also  perform  clustering 
efficiently  in  a feature  space  related  to  the  original  data 
space in a nonlinear way, compared to the basic SOM. 
In  the  SMTK,  clustering  is  defined  in  terms  of  an 
optimization  problem.  The cost function  E to be optimized 
is given as 

(7) 

where  M  is the  number of  data  and  c is  the  number of 
clusters.  The  binary variable  mij  indicates  whether the  ith 
sample  belongs  to  the jth cluster,  and  eij  is  the  error 
occurred  by  assigning  the  ith  sample  to  the jth cluster. 
Given a mapping  ¢J  from input space X to a feature space 
F  as  explained  above,  the  partial  assignment  cost  eij  is 
defined as 

1  c 

eif  ==2~?JII~(x,)-ctll' 

2 

(Vj), 

(8) 

where  ¢J (x•)  and  c1  are  a sample and  a cluster center in  a 
feature space F,  respectively. hJI  is a neighborhood function 
between jth and  lth clusters,  and  determines the  coupling 
between the two clusters as in SOM. 

The STMK algorithm provides an  efficient procedure  to 
find a good solution to the minimization of the cost function 
in  Equation  (7),  based on  deterministic annealing  (Rose et 
a/.,  1990)  and  the  EM  algorithm.  Starting  with  a random 
initialization  of  eij  tor  all  data  and  clusters,  the  algorithm 
iteratively updates the parameters  using the EM  algorithm 
with  some  temperature-annealing  schedule.  In  the  E-step, 
expectation values of m",  the probability that the ith sample 
is  assigned  to  the jth cluster,  is  estimated  for each  pair of 
data and clusters. Then all the  parameters related with the 
calculation  of  cluster centers  in  a feature  space  F  are 
updated in the M-step.

cerevisiae  cell  cycle  data  (Spellman  et a/.,  1998).  This 
dataset  (available  at http://cellcycle-www.stanford.edu) 
contains  the  time  series  of  relative  expression 
measurements of more than 6,000 genes from cell cultures 
synchronized  by  three  independent  methods.  In  the  first 
set, the a mating factor pheromone was used to arrest cells 
in  G1  and  samples  were  taken  in  every  7  minutes 
throughout  140  minutes.  In  the  second  set,  centrifugal 
elutriation  was  used  to  collect  small  G1  cells  in  every  30 
minutes during  6.5  hours.  In  the third,  cdc15  temperature(cid:173)
sensitive mutant was used to arrest cells in late mitosis and 
samples  were  taken  in  every  10  minutes  during  300 
minutes.  Additionally,  samples  from  arrest  of  a  cdc28 
temperature-sensitive  mutant  (Cho  et a/.,  1998)  were 
included  in  the  dataset.  The  analysis  of  these  data  sets 
enables  researchers  to  identify  cycles  or waves  of 
expressions that are meaningful in biological processes. 

Spellman  and  his  colleagues  (Spellman,  1998)  have 

identified  800  genes  whose  expressions  are  cell cycle(cid:173)
regulated  using  their  periodicity  and  correlation  analysis 
methods.  Among  the  800  yeast  genes,  we  selected  700 
genes with at most 4 missing entries over 73 conditions:  18 
time  points  over  a  arrest,  24 over cdc15  arrest,  17  over 
cdc28  arrest,  and  14  over  elutriation.  For  each  gene,  the 
missing  values  were  filled  by  the  average  values  of  the 
either side  of  the  time  points,  assuming  the  smooth 
variation  of  gene  expression  levels  during  the  cell  cycle. 
Finally,  the  dataset  is  represented  by  a  73 x 700  matrix 
where  each  gene  is  represented  by  a  column  vector 

containing 73 attributes of gene expression levels. 

Results 

Initially,  we  applied  the  aspect  model  to extract  latent 
patterns  inherent  in  the  gene  expression  variation  during 
the  progress  of  cell  cycle.  In  the  aspect  model,  observed 
values  are  assumed  to  be  count-valued.  Prior  to  the 
analysis,  therefore,  all  the  expression  values  vp  (1::.;;  i:s;; 
700,  1 ::.;;  j::.;;  73)  were  first  transformed  to  positive  integer 
values by r(aj, w) = [100 x (1/(1 +exp(-vj,)))r. 

The  yeast  cell  cycle  data  was  analyzed  with  varying 
number of latent factors z={z1,  22,  ... ,  z.<},  from  K=5  to K=10. 
The  result  with  K=6  is  shown  in  Fig.  2,  where  the 
expression  patterns  are  plotted  across  the  18 time  points 
from  the a-factor experiments.  It can  be seen  that different 
periodicities  of  gene  expression  are  captured  in  the  six 
patterns.  Compared with  the cell  cycle  phase  described  in 
(Spellman et at.,  1998), these patterns relatively well  reflect 
peak expression behaviors in  respective cell  cycle phases: 
M/G1-phase  (patterns  1 and  2),  G1-phase  (pattern  3), 
G1/S-phase  (pattern  4),  S/G2-phase  (pattern  5),  and  M(cid:173)
phase (pattern 6). 

Additionally,  we  clustered  the  700  genes  using  the 
learned  aspect  model  in  Fig.  2  and  the  STMK  algorithm. 

' By  multiplying  a constant  100,  we  actually consider  to  the 
second  decimal  point  of  the  values  (in  the  range  of  0 to  1) 
obtained by 1/(1+exph;)).

Fig.  3.  The  STMK clustering  map  of genes from  yeast cell  cycle  data.  700  genes  with  less than  or equal  to 4 missing  values,  among 
Spellman's 800  putative  cell  cycle-regulated  genes,  were  clustered  into 36  (6 x 6)  groups.  Expression  levels  (y-axis)  over the  18 time 
points (x-axis) from the experiment of a-factor synchronization are shown.  In each cluster, the solid line is the mean expression values of 
the genes in the cluster and the dotted line is the standard deviation in expression levels of those. 

The  kernel  function  in  Equation  (4)  was  used  to  calculate 
similarities  between two  genes.  Fig.  3 shows the  resulting 
cluster map with 36 clusters on the 6 x 6 grid.  Each cluster 
is represented  by the average expression pattern of genes 
in the cluster.  Different periodicities in gene expression are 
shown  across  the  clusters  on  the  grid  and  the  adjacent 
clusters have similar patterns. 

Cluster structure  is  also  presented  in  terms  of  latent 
patterns  (Fig.  4).  A gene x  is mapped  into the  latent space 
produced by the aspect model and is represented by a vector 
Of  probabilitieS,  Y,=(f(z!lx.),P(z,,x,),···P(z,lx)),  L/(zljx)=i 
Then cluster centers C  (1  s  k s36) in the latent space are 
expressed as linear combinations of y, by

where a,k  is the contribution of the ith sample to the cluster k. 
The genes in a cluster are now distinguished from those 
in  other clusters  by  the  combination  characteristics  of the 
latent  patterns.  The  cluster  1 of  the  top-left-most,  for 
example,  shows the  highest  probabilities  in  the  pattern  3. 

The third pattern in Fig. 2 characterizes genes of which the 
first  peaks  of  their  expression  are  observed  at  the 
measurement points  around  21  minutes  from  the  start  of 
the  a-factor  experiments.  This  is  a typical  expression 
behavior of the  genes  in  the  G1  phase group identified  in 
(Spellman eta/.,  1998),  and  all  45  genes (CDC45,  CLBS, 
MSH2,  MSH6,  etc)  in  the  cluster  1 are  found  in  the  G1 
phase group.  Nearby clusters of cluster 1 in  Fig.  4 shows 
the similar combination  patterns,  and most of the genes in 
those  clusters  are  found  in  the  G1  phase  group.  Similar 
analysis is possible for clusters 6,  31,  36:  patterns 4 and 5 
are  dominant  in  cluster 6,  patterns  1 and  2 in  cluster 31, 
and  pattern  6 in  cluster 36.  Genes  in  those  clusters  are 
found  in  the  phase  groups  of  which  typical  expression 
characteristics  are  similar to  the  dominant  patterns.  35 
genes  (HHF1,  HTA1,  HTA2,  HTB2,  etc)  among  39  in  the 
cluster  6,  21  (ACE2,  CLB1,  CLB2,  MOB1,  etc)  genes 
among 24 in  cluster 31,  and all  35  genes (ASH1,  CDC46, 
MFA2,  SIC1,  etc)  in  cluster 36  belong  to  S phase  group, 
M/G1  phase  group,  and  G2/M  phase  group,  respectively. 
The constitution of all the clusters in terms of phase groups 
identified by Spellman et at. are described in Table 1.

Table 1. The assignment table of 700 genes to 36 clusters. Cluster enumeration is the same as those in Figures 3 and 4.  In each 
cluster,  genes  assigned  to  the  cluster  are  divided  according  to  their  phase  group  specified  by  Spellman  et  al.  Note  that  these 
classification of genes in  a cluster are not rigid, since the classification at the boundary between two phases are rather ambiguous 
(Spellman et al.,  1998). For example, six of the eight genes (PSA1,  CBF2, YLL012W,  YBL009W,  SVL3, KAR3,  SPC98,  SRL 1) in 
cluster 5,  classified as being peak-expressed in G1  phase, are actually among the first 14 genes from the boundary of G1  and  S 
phase.

interesting  interpretation.  When  we  go from  cluster  1 to 
cluster  6 along  the  top  margin,  for  example,  we  can  see 
that pattern 3 declines steadily and pattern 5 rises instead. 
This  shows  the  distinction  among  genes  in  different 
clusters  in  terms  of  the  peak time  in  their  expression, 

where  the  first  peak time  of the  genes  with  higher 
probabilities  of  pattern  3  is  earlier than  that  of  the  genes 
with  the  opposite  combination.  Referred  to  the  G1  phase 
group ordered by their peak times (Spellman,  1998), genes 
in  cluster  1 and  cluster 2 are found  in  the  earlier part than

those in cluster 3 and 4.  Most of the genes in cluster 5 are 
located  in  the  boundary  of  G1  phase  group  and  S phase 
group,  and  most  of  those  in  cluster  6 are  found  in  the  S 
phase  group.  Similar  tendencies  are  observed  in 
subsequent  routes:  from  cluster  6 to  cluster 36  along  the 
right margin, from cluster 36 to cluster 31  along the bottom 
margin  (Table  1 ).  In  this  way,  a  proper  discovery  and 
exploitation  of the  inherent  structures  in  gene  expression 
behaviors helps us for further understanding of expression 
time-series data. 

Conclusions 

We  have  presented  an  effective  approach  for  gene 
expression  pattern  analysis,  based  on  latent variable 
models  and  topographic  clustering.  Applied  to  the 
expression analysis of the cell cycle-regulated genes of the 
yeast  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  various  distinctive 
patterns  underlying  the  data set were  extracted  by  an 
efficient  latent variable  model,  that  is,  the  aspect  model. 
The  identified  patterns  well  correspond  to  the  typical 
expression  behaviors  of  genes  regulated  in  specific cell 
cycle  phases.  In  topographical  clustering,  based  on  the 
STMK algorithm and a similarity measure derived from the 
aspect  model,  the  discovered  gene  clusters  are  well 
reflecting their characteristic expression patterns during the 
progress of cell cycle. 

In  addition,  our apprach  has  provided  two  informative 
maps  on  the  cluster structure.  The  first  map  depicts  each 
cluster by the  expression variation  of  genes in  the  cluster, 
across  the  measured time  points.  In  the  second  map,  the 
clusters  are  depicted  by the  combination  patterns of latent 
properties  inherent in  the  data.  A meta-level  analysis  and 
visualization  based  on  these  coupled  maps  enables  a 
more principled interpretation of gene expression patterns. 
As  future  works,  we  are  considering  to  incorporate 
another  type  of  information  for  gene  expression  data 
analysis.  The learning in  latent variable models is  basically 
unsupervised.  In  some  cases,  however,  existing  labeled 
data can  be  used  during training to  improve  performance. 
For the  yeast  data,  for  example,  more  than  100 genes 
have been  already identified  as  being cell  cycle-regulated. 
Hierarchical  latent variable  models  and  semi-supervised 
learning  in  the  model  could  be  applied  to  utilizing  this 
information.  Additionally,  we  will  study on  the  selection  of 
appropriate  number of  latent  factors  of  aspect  models  in 
the  analysis  of  gene  expression  data.  In  probabilistic 
generative models like aspect models, this problem can  be 
reduced  to  a  model  selection  problem.  Then,  standard 
techniques  from  statistics,  based  on  various  criteria  such 
as BIC and MDL, could be used in our works.
