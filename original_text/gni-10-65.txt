Abstract

We  have  discovered  copy  number  variations  (CNVs)  in 
3,578  Korean  individuals  with  the  Affymetrix  Genome- 
Wide  SNP  array  5.0,  and  4,003  copy  number  variation 
regions  (CNVRs)  were  defined  in  a  previous  study.  To 
explore  the  details  of  the  variants  easily  in  related  stud-
ies,  we  built  a  database,  cataloging  the  CNVs  and  re-
lated  information.  This  system  helps  researchers  brows-
ing  these  variants  with  gene  and  structure  variant 
annotations.  Users  can  easily  find  specific  regions  with 
search  options  and  verify  them  from  system-integrated 
genome  browsers  with  annotations.

Availability:  The  East  Asian  CNV  database  (EACDB)  can 
be  accessed  at  www.ircgp.com/EACNVDB.html.  Some 
configuration  and  server  installation  should  be  done  be-
fore  the  system  integration.  Contact  yejun@catholic.ac.kr

Introduction

Copy  number  variation  (CNV)  is  a  common  type  of 
structural  variation  in  the  human  genome.  They  have 
been  suggested  to  be  related  to  disease  susceptibility 
or  human  phenotype  diversity  [1-3].  Current  genome-
wide  association  studies  of  CNVs  are  attempting  to  find 
how  they  are  related  to  disease  susceptibility  or  pheno-
typic  diversity.  Due  to  the  fact  that  frequencies  of  CNVs 
show  ethnic  differences  [4-7],  a  finding  of  disease  or 
phenotype  association  of  a  specific  CNV  in  one  pop-

ulation  is  hard  to  generalize  to  other  populations.  How-
ever,  by  comparing  the  frequencies  of  target  CNVs 
among  different  ethnic  groups,  we  could  assume  the 
population-specific  disease  susceptibility  or  phenotype 
difference. 
    In  this  regard,  CNV  frequency  information  of  various 
populations  has  become  a  major  concern  of  population 
or  disease  association  studies. 
    With  increasing  interest  in  CNVs,  many  CNV  projects 
have  been  announced  recently.  Many  of  them  have  al-
ready  established  large  databases  of  CNVs  from  many 
different  ethnic  groups  (Database  of  Genomic  Variants 
[DGV],  http://projects.tcag.ca;  The  Copy  Number  Vari-
ants  Projects,  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/research/areas/ 
humangenetics/cnv/)  [8].  There  are  also  several  data-
bases  for  supporting  population-specific  studies,  includ-
ing  the  CNV  Control  Database  for  Japanese  (http:// 
gwas.lifesciencedb.jp),  the  Singapore  Human  Mutation 
and  Polymorphism  Database  (shmed.bii.a-star.edu.sg) 
[9],  and  the  Thailand  Mutation  and  Variation  Database 
(www4a.biotec.or.th)  [10].  The  accumulation  of  CNV  in-
formation  seems  promising,  in  that  we  can  gradually  ex-
tend  the  knowledge  of  CNVs  everywhere  in  the  world. 
However,  it  will  take  a  long  time  to  fill  the  gap  of  CNV 
databases  covering  the  whole  population.       
    As  a  step  to  fill  this  gap,  we  discovered  a  Korean 
CNV  with  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  SNP  array  5.0 
(Affymetrix,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA)  in  a  previous  study 
[11].  In  this  study,  we  built  a  Korean  database  based  on 
the  findings  of  4,003  copy  number  variation  regions 
(CNVRs).  To  build  a  tool  that  is  easily  accessible  via  the 
web  for  Korean-specific  CNV  studies,  we  built  a  viewer 
for  browsing  these  CNVs. 

Features  and  Results

System  requisites

Java  Runtime  Environment  of  Sun  Microsystems  1.6.0   
(Oracle,  Redwood  City,  CA,  USA)  or  equivalent  is  re-
quired,  since  the  system  is  written  in  Java  language.  We 
used  MySQL  database  for  storing  and  retrieving  CNV 
data  and  GBrowse2  [12]  for  drawing  regional  infor-
mation.  Both  are  freely  available  from  their  distribution 
websites.
    Since  the  main  search  pages  are  written  in  Java 
Server  Page  (JSP)  language,  Apache  Tomcat  is  needed 

66 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  10(1)  65-67,  March  2012

for  the  application  server  and  Apache  HTTP  server  is 
needed  for  Gbrowse2  viewer  pages  (Fig.  1).

Data

CNVs  of  our  previous  study  were  retrieved  from  the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  of  3,578 
Korean  individuals.  A  total  of  4,003  CNVRs  were  de-
fined,  and  2,077  CNVRs  (51.9%)  were  potentially  novel. 
The  annotation  data  for  genes  were  collected  based  on 
the  Human  Mar.  2006  NCBI36/hg18  build,  and  reference 
structure  variants  were  retrieved  from  DGV  (hg18.v8. 
aut.2009).

Database  and  viewer

discovered  CNVs  by  their  positions  (Fig.  2).  Users  can 
also  filter  out  CNVs  based  on  the  DGV  overlapped  re-
gions,  CNV  type  (Gain/Loss/Complex),  or  their  frequen-
cies.  Each  selected  region  could  be  diagnosed  in  detail 
by  clicking  on  it.  DGV  and  OMIM  ID  columns  are  linked 
with  corresponding  websites,  and  CNVR  position  col-
umns  are  linked  with  the  genome  browser.  The  genome 
browser  is  integrated  based  on  the  open  source  project 
GBrowse2.  Users  can  seek  or  zoom  in/out  of  CNVs 
across  the  chromosome  by  entering  positions  or  clicking 
zoom  buttons.  GBrowse2  can  also  display  interesting 
areas  by  dragging  the  region  bar  without  reloading  the 
entire  page.  Gene  information  of  the  selected  area  is  al-
so  displayed,  and  details  will  be  given  on  separate  pop-
up  page  by  clicking  on  it. 

Our  web-based  database  viewer  can  display  previously 

Discussion

For  a  fast-paced  research  environment,  a  viewer  for 
searching  and  observing  data  in  one  step  is  very  handy. 
We  hope  our  system  can  help  researchers  who  are  in-
terested  not  only  in  our  target  polymorphism  study  but 
also  in  a  viewer  for  polymorphisms  for  general  pur-
poses.
    We  chose  a  web-based  platform  for  the  tool  because 
of  its  usability  and  ease  of  maintenance.  Since  its  work-
load  is  very  small  as  an  input  query  for  a  viewer,  a 
web-based  platform  does  not  have  drawbacks,  like  oth-
er  calculation  applications  with  very  large  data.
