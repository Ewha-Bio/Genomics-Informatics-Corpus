Abstract

Blood  pressure  refers  to  the  force  exerted  by  circulating 
blood  on  the  walls  of  blood  vessels,  and  chronical  ele-
vation  of  blood  pressure  is  known  as  hypertension. 
Although  hypertension  is  affected  by  genetic  and  envi-
ronmental  factors,  the  genetic  background  of  hyper-
tension  is  not  fully  understood.  One  of  the  candidate 
genetic  factors,  Prostaglandin-endoperoxide  synthase  2 
(PTGS2),  is  a  membrane-bound  enzyme,  catalyzing  the 
conversion  of  arachidonic  acid  to  prostaglandin,  and  re-
cently  SNPs  of PTGS2  gene  was  associated  with  hyper-
tension  in  Japanese  population.  Therefore  the  associa-
tion  of  PTGS2  polymorphisms  was  investigated  with 
blood  pressure  in  healthy  Korean  subjects,  470  un-
related  individuals  randomly  selected  from  Ansung  and 
Ansan  cohorts.  The  25  SNPs  of PTGS2  gene  were  iden-
tified  by  the  sequencing  analysis  of  24  Korean  samples. 
Among  identified  polymorphisms,  three  SNPs  (rs689466, 
-1329A＞G;  rs5275,  +6365T＞C;  rs4648308,  +8806G＞
A)  were  selected  for  further  association  analysis,  and 
rs689466  located  in  promoter  region  was  associated 
with  blood  pressure  as  well  as  triglyceride  level  in  the 
blood.  By  in  silico  analysis,  rs689466  locates  in  v-Myb 
transcription  factor  binding  site,  and  the  v-Myb  site  dis-
appears  when  the  SNP  is  changed  from  A  to  G 
nucleotide.  Individuals  with  A/G  and  G/G  genotype  in 
rs689466  have  higher  blood  pressure  than  those  with 
A/A  genotype,  and  the  regression  p-value  is  0.008  for 
systolic  and  0.004  for  diastolic  blood  pressure.  In  sum-
mary,  the PTGS2  polymorphism  (rs689466)  is  associated 
with  blood  pressure  in  Asian  populations  based  on  this 
and  Japanese  studies,  shedding  light  on  it  as  a  genetic

Introduction

Blood  pressure  refers  to  the  force  exerted  by  circulating 
blood  on  the  walls  of  blood  vessels,  chronic  elevation  of 
blood  pressure  is  known  as  hypertension.  In  general  hy-
pertension  express  itself  no  symptoms,  however  when 
long  period  it  lets  alone,  gives  an  obstacle  to  brain, 
heart  and  kidney  and  treatment  is  necessary  in  order  to 
escape  a  fatal  complication  (Dennis  et  al.,  2004). 
Although  Mendelian  traits  related  to  hypertension  have 
large  effects  in  affected  individuals  (Nakayama  et al., 
2002;  Xu  et al.,  1999),  they  only  account  for  a  very 
small  fraction  of  hypertension.  The  contribution  of  ge-
netic  factors  to  blood  pressure  variance  is  estimated  to 
be  about  30%,  and  the  genetic  background  of  essential 
hypertension  is  not  fully  understood  (Naber  and  Siffert, 
2004;  Park  et al.,  2008).
    Prostaglandin-endoperoxide  synthase  2  (PTGS2)  is  a 
membrane-bound  enzyme  that  catalyzes  the  conversion 
of  arachidonic  acid  to  prostaglandin  and  is  associated 
with  biologic  events  such  as  injury,  inflammation,  and 
proliferation  (Hla  and  Neilson,  1992;  Tazawa  et al., 
1994).  PTGS2-mediated  prostanoids  play  an  important 
role  in  maintaining  blood  pressure  (Anderson  et al., 
1976;  Daniels et al.,  1967).  Specially  the  cortical PTGS2- 
derived  prostaglandin  I2  participates  in  the  pathogenesis 
of  renal  vascular  hypertension  through  stimulating  renal 
rennin  synthesis  and  release  (Hao  and  Breyer,  2008). 
Clinical  studies  as  well  as  animal  studies  also  demon-
strate  important  roles  for  PTGS2  in  maintaining  car-
diovascular  homeostasis  (Zewde  and  Mattson,  2004; 
Zhang  et al.,  2006).  PTGS2  is  upregulated  in  animal 
models  of  cardiac  failure  (Abassi  et al.,  2001;  Adderley 
and  Fitzgerald,  1999),  and  its  expression  has  been  de-
tected  in  heart  failure  in  humans  (Wong  et al.,  1998). 
PTGS2  gene  is  located  on  chromosome  1q25.2-q25.3 
(Hla  and  Neilson,  1992)  and  its  cDNA  encodes  a  604 
amino  acid  protein.
    Recently  a  large-scale  association  study  in  Japanese 
population  revealed  the  association  of  PTGS2  poly-

morphism  with  hypertension  (Iwai  et al.,  2004).  There-
fore,  the  association  of PTGS2  polymorphisms  was  ad-
dressed  in  this  study  with  blood  pressure  in  healthy 
Korean  population. 

Methods

Sequencing  analysis 
fication

for  PTGS2  SNP 

identi-

The  genetic  variants  of PTGS2  gene  were  identified  by 
the  sequencing  analyses  from  24  unrelated  Koreans. 
PTGS2  genomic  region  was  sequenced  comprising  all 
exons,  5'UTR,  3'UTR,  up  to  1.5  kb  exon-intron  boun-
dary  regions,  and  promoter  region. 
    The  information  for  the  genomic  DNA  sequence  of 
PTGS2  was  obtained  from  GenBank  database  (http:// 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).  Genomic  regions  targeted  for  se-
quencing  were  amplified  by  polymerase  chain  reaction 
(PCR)  from  genomic  DNA  of  24  immortalized  cell  lines 
generated  from  unrelated  Koreans.  Primers  for  PCR  were 
designed  using  Primer3  program  (http://www-genome. 
wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) 
(Rozen  and 
Skaletsky,  2000)  (Supplemental  Table  1).  PCR  amplified 
fragments  were  sequenced  on  both  strands  using  an  ABI 
Prism  3730  sequencer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City, 
CA,  USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer's  protocol.  The 
PolyPhred  program  (http://  droog.gs.washington.edu/poly-
phred/)  was  employed  to  assemble  the  sequences  and 
identify  SNPs  (Nickerson  et al.,  1997).

Subjects

Two  community  cohorts  (Ansung  and  Ansan)  in  South 

Korea  were  initiated  from  2001  as  major  projects  for  the 
Korean  Health  and  Genome  Study  (KHGS)  in  Korea 
National  Institute  of  Health  (KNIH).  The  Ansan  cohort 
mostly  represents  urban  community,  while  the  Ansung 
cohort  a  rural  community.  All  participants  in  either  co-
hort  are  about  40∼69  years  old,  reside  within  the  sur-
vey  area  for  at  least  6  months,  and  are  mentally  and 
physically  healthy.  Cohort  examinations  were  accom-
plished  biennially  for  the  prospective  studies.  Up  to 
date,  2,239  men  and  2,779  women  in  Ansung,  and 
2,523  men  and  2,497  women  in  Ansan  participated  in 
the  cohorts.
    In  this  study,  470  unrelated  individuals  were  randomly 
selected  from  two  community  cohorts  who  were  healthy 
based  on  medical  examination  results.  The  study  was 
approved  by  the  institutional  review  board  of  KNIH.  All 
subjects  gave  written  informed  consents.

Genotyping

Among  identified  polymorphisms  from  the  sequencing 
analysis  of PTGS2  gene,  three  SNPs  (rs689466,  -1329A 
＞G;  rs5275,  +6365T＞C;  rs4648308,  +8806G＞A)  were 
selected  based  on  minor  allele  frequency  (＞0.05),  link-
age  disequilibrium  (LD)  status  and  haplotype  tagging 
status  (Fig.  1,  Supplemental  Table  2).
    SNPs  were  genotyped  using  amplifying  primers  and 
probes  designed  for  TaqMan  (Livak,  1999).  Primer 
Express  (Applied  Biosystems)  was  used  to  design  both 
the  PCR  primers  and  the  MGB  TaqMan  probes.  One  al-
lelic  probe  was  labeled  with  the  FAM  dye,  and  the  other 
was  labeled  with  the  fluorescent  VIC  dye.  PCRs  were 
run  in  the  TaqMan  Universal  Master  mix  without  UNG 
(Applied  Biosystems),  and  with  PCR  primer  concen-
trations  of  900  nM  and  TaqMan  MGB  probe  at  a  con-

centration  of  200  nM.  Reactions  were  performed  in 
384-well  format  in  a  total  reaction  volume  of  5μl  using 
20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The  plates  were  then  placed  in 
a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9700,  Applied  Biosystems)  and 
heated  at  50oC  for  2  min  and  95oC  for  10  min,  followed 
by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  15  s  and  60oC  for  1  min  with 
a  final  soak  at  25oC.  The  TaqMan  assay  plates  were 
transferred  from  the  thermal  cyclers  to  a  real-time  PCR 
system  (Prism  7900HT,  Applied  Biosystems)  that  read 
the  fluorescence  intensity  in  each  well  of  the  plate. 
Fluorescence  data  files  from  each  plate  were  analyzed 
using  automated  software  (SDS  ver.  2.1,  Applied  Bio-
systems).

Clinical  characteristic  measurement

Blood  samples  were  drawn  for  biochemical  measure-
ment  (triglyceride,  total  cholesterol,  high-density  lip-
oprotein,  low-density  lipoprotein)  and  DNA  extraction. 
The  clinical  characteristics  of  the  study  population  are 
shown  in  Table  1.  The  blood  pressure  in  this  study  was 
measured  three  times  in  lying  position  in  systolic  and  di-
astolic  status,  and  averaged  for  three  measurements. 

Statistics

Deviation  of  genotype  frequency  from  expected  Hardy- 
Weinberg  equilibrium  was  examined  with  the  chi-square 
test.  To  approximate  a  normal  distribution,  systolic 
blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood  pressure,  triacylglyceride, 
total  cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol,  non 

HDL  cholesterol,  and  total/HDL  cholesterol  ratio  were 
log  transformed  before  analysis  (Oh  et al.,  2007).  We 
examined  linkage  disequilibrium  (representied  by r2)  for 
PTGS2  gene  using  Haploview  v3.2  (http://www.broad. 
mit.edu/mpg/haploview/)  (Barrett et al.,  2005).  The  asso-
ciations  between  SNPs  and  hypertension-related  pheno-
types  were  determined  by  linear  regression  analysis 
while  controlling  age,  sex,  and  BMI.  The  SAS  statistical 
software  package  (SAS  Institute  Inc.  Cary,  NC,  USA) 
was  used 
to  perform  general  statistical  analyses. 
Statistical  significance  was  determined  at  a  two-tailed 
value  of  p＜0.05.

Korean  SNP  database

The  information  of  most  SNPs  described  in  this  study  is 
available  in  the  Korean  SNP  database  (http://www.ngri.

Genome  Sciences  (KNIH).

Results  and  Discussion

By  direct  DNA  sequencing  in  24  Korean  individuals,  25 
genetic  variants  of PTGS2  gene  were  identified  and  their 
allele  frequencies  were  depicted  in  supplemental  Table 
2  (refer  in  detail  http://www.ngri.re.kr/SNP/).  6  variants 
were  located  in  promoter  and  5'UTR  region,  5  in  exons, 
and  14  in  introns  and  3'UTR  (Fig.  1).

healthy  subjects  were  selected  for  the  association  geno-
typing  from  Ansung  and  Ansan  community  cohorts  in 
Korea and their clinical profiles were presented in Table 2.
    Linear  regression  analysis  was  used  to  examine  their 
associations  with  blood  pressure  controlling  age,  sex 
and  BMI  (Table  3).  One  SNP,  rs689466  (-1329A＞G)  lo-
cated  in  promoter  was  found  to  be  associated  with  both 
systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and  diastolic  blood  pres-
sure  (DBP)  in  the  co-dominant  and  dominant  genetic 
models  (SBP  p-value  0.038  and  0.008  in  the  co-domi-
nant  and  dominant,  respectively,  DBP  p-value  0.018  and 
0.006  in  the  co-dominant  and  dominant,  respectively). 
Carriers  of  G  allele  in  rs689466  showed  higher  blood 
pressure  in  both  SBP  and  DBP  than  non-carrier  (AA 
genotype).  This  association  result  replicates  the  previous 
finding  in  Japan  population  (Iwai  et al.,  2004).

netic  effects  of  PTGS2  polymorphisms  on  blood  traits 
related  to  lipid  were  also  investigated.  Although  no  as-
sociation  was  detected  in  total  cholesterol,  HDL,  and 
LDL  analyses,  triglyceride  levels  in  these  subjects  re-
vealed  a  significant  association  with  rs689466  (Table  1). 
Carriers  of  G  allele  in  rs689466  showed  higher  trigly-
ceride  levels  in  blood  than  non-carriers  (AA  genotype)  in 
concordant  with  the  result  of  blood  pressure.  Elevated 
plasma  triglyceride  levels  are  observed  in  many  meta-
bolic  diseases  such  as  metabolic  syndrome,  diabetes 
mellitus  and  hypertension  (Austin,  1999,  Brewer,  1999), 
and  in  diabetic  model  mice  PTGS2  gene  expression  is 
previously  reported  to  be  increased  (Laybutt  et al., 
2002).

factor  analysis  using  TRANSFAC  database  (http:www. 
cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html)  found  that  v-Myb 
transcription  factor  binding  site  was  disappeared  by  the 
substitution  of  A  allele  with  G  allele  in  rs689466. 
According  to  these  results,  SNP  rs689466  might  be  im-
portant  site  for  the  gene  expression  regulation  of PTGS2 
on  primates.
    Genetic  association  studies  often  fail  to  replicate  pre-
vious  findings,  in  part  due  to  the  polygenetic  nature  of 
the  disease.  Another  potential  reason  may  be  the  diver-
sity  of  investigated  populations.  Allele  frequencies  of 
PTGS2  (rs689466:-1329A＞G)  in  Korean  population  were 
compared  with  those  in  other  populations  obtained  from 
HapMap  data  (Fig.  2).  Asian  populations  have  higher  al-
lele  frequencies  (Korean;  0.467,  Japanese;  0.500,  Chi-
nese;  0.511)  than  European  and  African  populations 
(European;  0.142,  African;  0.075).  SNP  rs689466  was 
found  to  be  insignificant  in  the  hypertension  results  of 
Genome-wide  association  study  of  Welcome  Trust  Case 
Control  Consortium  (http://www.wtccc.org.uk/)  that  might 
be  attributed  by  the  low  allele  frequency  of  the  SNP. 
    In  this  study,  we  investigated  the  effect  of  PTGS2 
polymorphisms  on  the  blood  pressure  and  lipids  in 
healthy  subjects  selected  from  Ansung  and  Ansan  com-
munity  cohort  and  identified  one  polymorphism  of 
PTGS2  gene  which  is  associated  with  blood  pressure  as 
well  as  triglyceride  in  blood.  This  finding  sheds  light  on 
a  genetic  polymorphism  of PTGS2  ,  rs689466  as  a  use-
ful  genetic  marker  for  the  blood  pressure  and  blood  tri-
glyceride  level.
