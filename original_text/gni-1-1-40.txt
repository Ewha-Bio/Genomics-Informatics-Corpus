Abstract 

The  genes  related  to specific events  or pathways  in 
bacteria are  frequently  localized  proximate to the 
genome of their neighbors,  as  with the structures 
known  as  operon,  but eukaryotic genes  seem  to be 
independent of their neighbors,  and  are  dispersed 
randomly throughout genomes.  Although  cases  are 
rare,  the findings from  structures  similar to  prokary(cid:173)
otic operons  in  the  nematode genome,  and  the 
clustering of housekeeping genes on human genome, 
lead  us to assess the genomic association  of genes 
as  functional  subunits.  We  evaluated  the genomic 
association of neighboring genes on chromosomes 4 
and  5  of Arabidopsis thaliana with  and  without 
respectively  consideration  of the  scaffold/matrix(cid:173)
attached regions (S/MAR) loci. The observed number 
of functionally  identical  bigrams  and  trigrams were 
significantly higher than  expected,  and  these  results 
were  verified  statistically by calculating p-values for 
weighted  random  distributions.  The  observed 
frequency  of functionally  identical  bigrams and 
trigrams were  much  higher in  chromosome 4 than  in 
chromosome 5, but the frequencies with, and without, 
consideration  of the  S/MAR  in  each  chromosome 
were  similar.  In  this study,  a genomic association 
among  functionally  related  neighboring  genes  in 
Arabidopsis thaliana was suggested.

The  more  genomes  of various  organisms  are  revealed, 
from  complete  sequencing,  the  more  insights we  gain  into 
the  sequences  themselves.  These  include:  the  orga(cid:173)
nization of genomes, the structure of genes and regulatory 
elements,  and  the  conservation  of gene order  in  evolution 
(Dandekar eta/.,  1998).  The  genome  rearrangement  in 
living  organism  is  a progressive  form  of  evolution,  where 
genomes  are  constantly  rearranged  and  shuffled  (Von 
Mering and Bork, 2002).  In bacterial genomes, the strength 
of genomic associations correlates with the strength of the 
functional associations between the genes. Several reports 
have  suggested  that  genomic  associations  reflect 
functional  association  between  their proteins  (Dandekar, 
1998; Enright eta/., 1999; Marcotte et at.,  1999; Pellegrini et 
at.,  1999; Overbeek eta/.,  1999; Huynen et at.,  2000; Yanai 
et at.,  2001 ).  In  addition,  Snel  et at.  (2002)  obtained  a 
protein  interaction  network  by  combining  the  pairwise 
interactions  between  proteins,  predicted  from  the 
conserved  co-occurrence  of  their  genes  in  operons  (Snel 
et at., 2002). The genomes of higher-order eukaryotes,  like 
animals,  plants  and  fungi,  seem  to  be  relatively  disor(cid:173)
ganized,  with  the  average  gene  generally  assumed  to  be 
independent  of  its  neighbors,  with  only  a few  exceptions, 
such  as  repeats  of  similar  sequences  caused  by  gene 
duplications, and a limited number of ancient gene clusters 
containing  functionally  related  genes  (Von  Mering  and 
Bork,  2002).  However,  it  has  been  revealed  that  neigh(cid:173)
boring  genes  are  occasionally  assembled  into  regulatory 
units,  called  operons,  in  the  nematode  (Biumental  eta/., 
2002). The estimated proportion of genes,  expressed as a 
part  of  operon,  in  Caenorhabditis  e/egans  was  13-15% 
(Biumental  et a/.,  2002).  In  addition,  correlation  between 
transcriptome and protein-protein interactions was mapped 
for  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae,  with  genes  from  the  same 
functional  cluster  showing  a higher protein  interaction 
density (Ge et at.,  2001 ).  In this respect,  it is plausible that 
genes  with  similar transcription  profiles  may  have  a 
tendency  to  cluster  in  eukaryotic  genomes  (Cohen  et at., 
2002;  Lercher eta/.,  2002),  and  it  is  suggested  that 
functionally  related  proteins,  encoded  by  neighboring 
genes, either physically interact or are involved in a certain 
biological event. Although eukaryotic genes are not exactly 
the  same as  bacterial  operons,  it  would  be  advantageous

for  the  sets  of  genes  involved  in  a certain  biological 
process, to be localized as neighbors on the genome, with 
some  conservation  of  gene  order  (Lercher eta/.,  2002), 
where  their expression  might  be  regulated  as  a functional 
module. 

Eukaryotic chromosomes at the  interphase do  not exist 
as  condensed  structures,  but  their  relaxed  chromatin  is 
attached  on  the  scaffold/matrix  of  the  nucleus,  and  the 
looped  structure  can  be  dealt with  as  a functional  domain 
of  the  chromosome  or  genome  (Liebich  et at.,  2002). 
Efforts to  reveal  the  relationship  between  gene  regulatory 
mechanisms  and  the  nuclear  architecture  have  proved 
increased  evidence  (Stein,  1998),  and  the  scaffold/matrix(cid:173)
attached region (S/MAR) has been suggested as one of the 
abundant  regulatory  DNA  elements  of  the  eukaryotic 
genome (Frish eta/., 2001). S/MAR form the anchor points 
of loop domains, with  domain sizes  ranging from  a few kilo 
bases,  to  more  than  one  hundred  (Bode  et a/.,  1992), 
harbor one or more genes. However, there is no information 
on  either the  average  gene  number,  or the  functional 
relatedness between neighboring genes in a loop. 

S/MARt DB deposits several hundred S/MAR containing 
sequences,  extracted from  original  publications  (Liebich et 
at., 2002), and several bioinformatics methods form in si/ico 
S/MAR prediction have been developed programs, such as 
SMARTest  (Frish  et at.,  2001)  and  MAR-Finder (Singh  et 
a/.,  1997).  These  tools  use  several  motifs  in  their  library, 
including  origin  of  replication,  TG-rich  sequences,  curved 
DNA,  linked  DNA,  topoisomerase  II  sites,  and  AT-rich 
sequences.  These  motifs,  however,  do  not always appear 
on  every known  S/MAR containing  sequences.  Previously 
reported  S/MAR  consensus  patterns  were  recently 
compared  for  their  enrichment,  and  their  MAR/SAR 
recognition signature (MRS) (Van  Drunen eta/.,  1997; Van 
Drunen eta/.,  1999) verified  as the  most enriched motifs in 
the S/MAR containing sequences (Liebich et at., 2002). 

In  the  present  study,  we  collected  neighboring  gene 
sets,  with  and  without  considering  the  S/MAR  from 
chromosomes  4 and  5 of Arabidopsis  thaliana,  then 
analyzed the relation between their genomic and functional 
associations.  The  effects  of  S/MAR  on  the  association  of 
genes,  with  identical  function  sub-categories,  were  not 
confirmed,  but  it  was  suggested  that  genes  in  the  same 
functional sub-category were assembled together, and with 
statistical significance. 

Results 
Bigrams without considering S/MAR 
In  chromosomes  4 and  5 of Arabidopsis  thalinana,  there 
are 3744 (Mayer eta/,.  1999) and 5874 (The Kazusa DNA 
Research  Institute,  2002)  non-overlapping  genes, 

respectively.  We  collected  bigrams  from  two  frames 
according to the starting position.  According to the MAtDB, 
however,  some  genes  had  more  than  one  function 
category code assigned. These might come either from the 
ambiguity  of  the  gene  function  making  annotators  difficult 
to define exactly, or from the multifunctional feature of gene 
products. Therefore,  there is some  increase in the number 
of  bigrams  and  trigrams  caused  by  combination  between 
redundant  functions,  but  these  additional  function 
assignments  should  not  be  ignored.  We  collected  and 
accepted all the additional combined bigrams. The number 
of bigrams was 2178 for each frame in chromosome 4, and 
3208 and 3213 for frame1  and  2 of chromosome 5 (Table 
1 ).  The  average  proportion  of  big rams,  excluding  the  00, 
98,  and 99 function  categories were  17.21  and  10.87% for 
chromosome  4 and  5,  respectively  (Table  1).  From  these, 
functionally identical bigrams, that is,  bigrams composed of 
an  identical  function  sub-category,  were  counted,  and  the 
proportions  were  4.59  and  4.68%  for  frames  1 and  2 of 
chromosome 4,  and 2.46 and 2.33% for frames  1 and 2 of 
chromosome 5,  respectively (Table 1). 

We  evaluated  the  p-values  of  functionally  identical 
bigrams to assess the statistical significance for a weighted 
random  distribution.  The p-values  for  frames  1 and  2 for 
chromosome 4 were  1.8279x1 o-95  and  1.219293x1 o-93
,  and 
for  chromosome  5 were  1.7615x10-47  and  1.3772x10-4
\ 
respectively  (Table  1).  These p-values suggested that the 
probability of a genomic association of functionally identical 
bigrams,  due to chance, was extremely low.  The observed 
number  of  functionally  identical  bigrams  was  significantly 
higher  than  expected,  even  when  the  weighted  random 
distribution  was  considered  (Table  1 ).  The  observed 
number was  higher  in  chromosome  4,  although  the 
chromosome 5 also had a higher than expected number. 

We  mapped  all  the  bigrams  on  the  diagonal  matrices 
according  to  their  nineteen  large  function  categories  in 
order to  display their  global  genomic  association  (Fig.  2). 
The  diagonal  pairs showed  higher frequencies  of bigrams, 
and  the  pairs  on  categories  '01-metabolism'  and  '04-
transcription'  showed relatively higher frequencies than the 
other  pairs.  The  metabolism  and  transcription  categories 
are  the  first  and  second  largest  groups  in  both 
chromosomes  4 (01:  9.6%,  04:  5.6%)  (Mayer eta/.,  1999) 
5 (01:  21.1 %,  04:  18.6%)  (The  Kazusa  DNA  Research 
Institute,  2002).  Thus,  it  is  plausible that  those  associated 
pairs would appear more frequently.  However, the diagonal 
pairs,  i.e.,  composed  of  the  same  function  category, 
appeared  more  frequently  regardless  of  their  function 
category  and  the  proportion  of  the  function  category  in 
each chromosome. This coincided with higher probability of 
co-localizations  of  genes,  composed  of  identical  function 
sub-categories,  as  functionally  identical  bigrams.  The

matrices  of  chromosome  4 showed  clearer,  denser pairs 
on the diagonal than those of chromosome 5, and the pairs 
related  to  the  metabolism-01  and  transcription-04  function 
categories showed a higher frequency than the other pairs. 
This  occurred  because  there  were  more  fully  annotated 
genes in chromosome 4 than  in chromosome 5,  and there 
was  bias  in  the  proportion  of  function  categories  of 
annotated genes. 

Prediction  flanking  sequences that  containing 
SIMAR locus and collection of bigrams 
To  assess  the  effect  of  S/MAR  on  the  co-localization  of 
genes with an identical function sub-category, we predicted 
the  S/MAR  loci  on  chromosomes  4 and  5,  and  surveyed 
the  bigrams  on  both  sides  of  S/MAR.  We  collected  the 
flanking  sequences of he discrete  non-overlapping  genes, 
then  assessed  theirS/MAR  retention.  The  MATCH™ 
Profiler  program  generated  five  criteria  for  MRS-1  and 
MRS-2,  and  the  cutoff value  FN50  was  selected following 
tests  on  the  previously  reported  sequences.  The 
sequences  used  for these  tests  were  the  plastocyanin 
(z83321),  ATB2  (z82043)  and ATH1  (z83320)  genes  of 
Arabidopsis thaliana, and they experimentally confirmed for 
their  S/MAR  retention  (Van  Drunen,  Sewalt,  Oosterling, 
Weisbeek,  Keultjes,  Smeekens and VanDriel et at.,  1999). 
Using  the  FN50  criteria,  the  MATCH™  program  correctly 
predicted  all  the  experimentally  confirmed  S/MAR  loci  in 
the  test  sequences.  The  counts  of  flanking  sequences 
containing  S/MAR  loci  were  1119  and  1678  for 
chromosomes  4 and  5,  respectively  (Table  2).  From  this 
result,  the  densities  of the  S/MAR  loci  were  calculated  as 
one S/MAR locus per 15.5 kb for both chromosomes. 
This  means  two  or three  genes  reside,  on  average, 
between  two  S/MAR  loci,  as  the  gene  density  is  one  per 
4.6  kb  and  4.4  kb  for chromosomes  4 and  5,  respectively 
(The  European  and  The  Coldspring  Harbor  1999;  The 
Kazusa DNA Research Institute 2002). 

As  a pivot,  the  S/MAR  containing  sequences  give 
bigrams  in  both  directions,  so  we  collected  the  bigrams 
separately,  before  and  after  of  the  S/MAR  containing 
flanking  sequences.  Additionally,  we  collected  bigrams 
where the S/MAR resided  in the middle of two genes.  The 
proportions  of  functionally  identical  bigrams  for 
chromosome  4 (Table  2)  were  higher  (4.87-5.67%)  than 
for chromosome 5 (2.06-2.41%).  In  chromosome 4,  these

',  respectively. 
Although  these p-values  were  much  higher than  those 
cases  where  the  non-S/MAR  were  considered,  it  was 
difficult  to  determine  if  the  S/MAR  affects  the  genomic 
association  of  the  bigrams,  because p-values  were  all 
extremely  low.  Nevertheless,  these  p-values  suggested 
there was little probability of the appearance due to chance 
in  either  case,  and  the  observed  number  of  functionally 
identical  bigrams  was  significantly  higher than  expected 
considering the weighted random distribution. The matrices 
of  these  classes  (Fig.  3)  showed  similar  patterns  to  the 
cases  where  the  S/MAR  were  not  considered,  and  the 
diagonal pairs on  chromosome  4 were  denser than  those 
on  chromosome  5,  as  when  the  cases  of the  S/MAR was 
not considered. 

Trigrams without considering S/MAR 
As  previously  mentioned,  the  average  interval  of  S/MAR 
loci in chromosomes 4 and 5 was 15.5 kb,  and an average 
of two or three genes could reside in this interval. Thus, we 
extended  the  neighboring  gene  numbers  to  three,  and 
assessed  the  association  of  three  consecutive  genes  in 
their function.  We  divided  cases  into  two  classes,  those 
where  S/MAR were  not considered  and  those  where  they 
were, for the analyses of trig rams. 

For the  cases  where  the  S/MAR  was  not  considered, 
we  collected  trigrams  from  three  frames  according  to  the 
start  point.  There  were  around  1500  trigrams  for  each 
frame  in  chromosome  4 and  around  2190  trigrams  in 
chromosome  5 (Table  3).  The  proportions  of  trigrams 
without the 00/98/99 categories, on average were 8.73 and 
5.71%  for  chromosomes  4 and  5,  respectively.  This  was 
about  the  half  level  of  the  bigrams  because  there  were 
more_ chances  of  the  00,  98  and  99  function  categories 
being  neglected.  The  frequencies  of functionally  identical 
trigrams,  on  average  were  1.55  and  0.59%  for 

,  8.9400x1 0'105  and  1.2125x1 0'58 

chromosomes  4 and  5.  The p-values  for  the  weighted 
random  distributions were  1.2700x1 o-224
,  8.4649x1 o-264  and 
9.5589x1 o-252  for frames  1,  2 and 3 of chromosome 4,  and 
9.9222x1 0'76
for 
chromosome  5,  respectively.  These p-values  for  both 
chromosomes  suggested  the  probability  of  a genomic 
association of functionally identical trigram,  due to chance, 
is  extremely low,  and  the  observed  number of functionally 
identical trigrams was significantly higher,  statistically, than 
expected assuming the same weighted random distribution 
as with the bigrams. 

Trigrams considering S/MAR 
Using the same predicted S/MAR loci information as for the 
analyses of the  bigrams,  we collected trigrams  before and 
after  S/MAR  from  each  chromosome.  The  frequencies  of 
the trigrams with  identical function sub-category were  1. 79 
and  1.48% for  the  trigrams  before  and  after the  S/MAR 
position  in  chromosome  4,  and  0.66  and  0.38%  for 
chromosome  5 (Table  4),  respectively,  which  were  similar 
to those  cases when  S/MAR were  not considered.  The p(cid:173)
values  were  6.4265x1 0'254  and  2.4439x1 o-193  before  and 
after  S/MAR  on  chromosome  4,  and  2.0943x1 o-88  and 
3.0978x1 o- 29  on  chromosome  5.  This  indicated the 
probability of a genomic association of functionally identical 
trigrams  due  to  chance  to  be  extremely  low,  and  the 
observed  number  of  functionally  identical  trigrams  was 
significantly  higher,  statistically,  than  expected  assuming 
the same weighted  random  distribution as for the bigrams. 
With these results,  however,  it was not possible to suggest 
any correlation between the  genomic association of genes 
belonging to an identical function sub-category and S/MAR 
locus,  because  of  the  little  difference  in  the  frequency  of 
functionally  identical trigrams and p-values between cases 
when the S/MAR considered or not.

Discussion 

The  features  of  genes  in  eukaryotic  genome  are  being 
revealed  through  the  sequencing  efforts,  successive 
analyses  by  functional  genomics  and  from  in  silica 
analysis. Operon-like structures of neighboring genes have 
been  found  in  Caenorhabditis  elegans  (Biumental  et a/., 
2002),  which  suggests  that  similar  organization  could 
appear in the genome of other eukaryotic species.  If those 
functionally related genes are assembled in a boundary on 
the genome, the regulation of their concerted expression at 
a higher level  can  be  accomplished  more  easily,  and  the 
clustering  of  housekeeping  genes  of  the  human  genome 
(Lercher eta/.,  2002)  can  support  this  postulation.  In 
addition,  if there is any correlation between functions of the 
neighboring gene products, it could be used to predict both 
physical interactions between proteins, and protein function 
as the  conservation  of gene order in  bacterial  genomes  is 
routinely  used  for the  prediction  of  physical  interactions  of 
proteins,  and  the  prediction  of  unknown  function  of 
neighboring  gene  (Dandekar eta/.,  1998).  However, 
investigation  on  this  theme,  have  not  been  widely 
addressed on eukaryotic genomes. 

In  the  present  study,  we  described  the  association  of 
genes  belonging  to  identical  function  sub-categories  on 
chromosomes 4 and 5 of Arabidapsis thaliana. We initiated 
this  study  by  focusing  on  two  consecutive  gene  sets, 
because  the  gene  sets  composed  of  two  consecutive 
genes are the smallest of neighbored gene pairs, which we 
defined  as  'bigrams'  in  this  study.  The  collections  of 
bigrams  were  divided  into  two  cases  according  to  the 
consideration  of  the  S/MAR.  The  reason  the  S/MAR  was 
considered  for the  collection  of bigrams was  as a result of 
the  looped  structure  of  interphase  chromatin,  caused  by 
attachment of  S/MAR  on  the  nuclear matrix,  can  be  dealt 
with  a functional  subunit,  and  therefore  the  S/MAR  are 
thought to be the tools that subdivide eukaryotic genomes 
into structural and functional domains (Liebich eta/., 2002). 
Thus,  before  collecting  the  bigrams  we  predicted  the 
S/MAR  loci  of  the  whole  sequences  on  chromosomes  4 
and  5 of Arabidapsis  tha/iana.  The  S/MARt  DB,  the 
database  for  S/MAR,  contains  information  fully  extracted 
from  original  publications.  However,  we  could  not  find  all 
the  possible  S/MAR  loci  of Arabidapsis  thaliana  from  this 
database,  due  to  the  number of  entries  for  plants  only 
being  55,  including  13 entries  for Arabidapsis  thaliana. 
Therefore,  we  predicted  S/MAR  loci  from  an  in  silica 
method.  There  are  a couple  of  prediction  tools  publicly 
available  such  as  MAR-Finder and  SMARTest.  They  use 
several S/MAR related motifs in their predictions,  but these 
features  do  not always  appeared  on  every  known  S/MAR 
containing  locus,  and they are  not adjusted to our subject, 

thus we had to devise another method. We used two MRS 
that  had  been  reported  as  S/MAR  motifs  in  Arabidapsis 
thaliana (Van Drunen eta/.,  1997). These MRSs have been 
applied  in  other  species  (Van  Drunen  eta/.,  1999),  and 
furthermore,  were  defined  as  the  most  enriched  motifs  in 
S/MAR  containing  sequences  (Liebich  et a/.,  2002).  We 
extracted  MRS  matching  sequences  from  55  entries  of 
dicotyledonous  plants  from  the  S/MARt  DB,  and  made 
weight-matrices.  These  weight  matrices  were  tested  on 
several  experimentally  confirmed  S/MAR  containing 
sequences,  and  FN_50 profiles from  the  MATCH™ Profiler 
correctly  predicted  all  of  the  S/MAR  loci  on  them.  The 
MATCH program predicted S/MAR loci on chromosomes 4 
and  5,  and  the  average  interval  between  S/MAR  loci  was 
15.5  kb  for  both  chromosomes.  With  this  length  of 
sequences, an average of three genes can reside because 
the  gene  densities  for  chromosomes  4 and  5 are  4.6  kb 
and  4.4  kb  per gene,  respectively.  Thus,  we  extended the 
range  of  analyses  to  three  consecutive  gene  sets,  which 
we defined as  'trigrams' . 

In  the  collection  where the S/MAR was  not considered, 
we  tried  on  different two  frames  for  bigrams.  In  the  first 
frame,  we  chose  the  first  and  second  genes  for  the  first 
bigram,  and the third and fourth for the second, and so on. 
In the second frame, we chose the second and third genes 
for  the  first  bigram  and  so  on  for  subsequent  bigrams. 
Similarly,  we  chose  three  frames  for the  trigrams.  In  this 
way,  we  collected  independent bigrams and  trigrams,  and 
could  calculate  the p-values  for  the  binomial  random 
variable  I,  as  described  in  materials  and  methods.  The 
collections of bigrams and trigrams where the S/MAR was 
considered  were  also  statistically  independently  extracted 
as they were separated by predefined S/MAR loci.  Many of 
the  collected  bigrams  and  trigrams  were  excluded  in  this 
study,  because  we  did  not  considered  bigrams  and 
trigrams  with  unknown  or  unclassified function  categories. 
We  calculated  the  proportions  annotated  genes,  and  the 
known  function  categories  were  assigned  in  the  MAtDB, 
which  were  only about 32%  (1190/3744)  for chromosome 
4 and  18%  (1055/5874)  for  chromosome  5.  The  data  for 
bigrams  (Table  1 and  2)  and  trigrams  (Table  3 and  4) 
showed the frequencies composing the genes belonged to 
identical  function  sub-categories,  and  were  similar 
regardless  of  whether  the  S/MAR  was  considered  or  not, 
which  was  contrary to  our  expectations.  The  differences 
were  only the  frequencies  of  identical  bigrams  or trigrams 
of chromosome 5 were much smaller than chromosome 4. 
Although it was not easily possible to conclude, it might that 
there  were  more  unknown  or  unclassified  genes  on 
chromosome  5.  The p-values  were  evaluated  to  provide 
the  statistical  significance  of the  observed  frequencies  of 
functionally identical bigrams and trigrams. 

Computational Analysis of Neighboring Genes on Arabidopsis thaliana  4 7 

to 

those  with 

We  first  calculated  p-values  for  random  uniform 
distributions,  as  with  the  report  by  Ge  et  a/.  (Ge  et  a/., 
2001 ),  where  they  evaluated p-values  for  the  protein 
interacting  pairs  (and  triplets)  assuming  each  pair has  the 
same  probability  in  Saccharomyces  cerevisiae.  However, 
this assumption was not suitable for our study, because the 
p-values were  extremely small  when  this  assumption  was 
made,  and  could  not  be  used  for  calculations  using  our 
method.  The  other  reason  was  that  the  proportion  of 
annotated  genes  in  the Arabidopsis  thaliana  genome  are 
relatively  small  compared 
the 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae  genome whose  gene functions 
are  better  understood,  and  furthermore  their distribution  is 
somewhat  biased  to  a  couple  of  function  categories. 
Therefore,  we  provided  another  set  of p-values  for the 
weighted  random  distribution,  and  this  assumption 
introduced  a  more  realistic  situation.  In  fact,  excluding 
genes with  unknown  or  unclassified functions,  the function 
category  for  metabolism-01  was  the  largest  in  both 
chromosomes 4 and 5.  We considered a set of genes with 
a  known  function  sub-category,  which  we  called  K. 
Although  the  proportions of bigrams or trigrams  consisting 
of  an  identical  function  sub-category  were  similar,  of  the 
total bigrams or trigrams available,  when  either the  S/MAR 
was considered or not,  the p-values were much different. If 
the  S/MAR  had  some  effect  on  the  association  of  genes 
with respect to their function, the p-values when the S/MAR 
was considered  should  be  much  lower than  when  it  is  not, 
but the  p-values  when  the  S/MAR was  considered  were 
relatively  higher.  However,  this  did  not  mean  the  S/MAR 
affected  negatively on  the  genomic  association  of  genes 
with  identical  functions.  This  could  be  caused  by 
differences in  the  number of bigrams or trigrams collected. 
If we  were  to  try  more  bigrams  (or trigrams),  the  situation 
becomes  even  further  removed  farther  from  the  original 
assumption  of the  probability distribution  - both  for  uniform 
and weighted  random  distribution.  The  real  frequencies  of 
the  functionally  identical  bigrams  and  trigrams  were  much 
higher than  expected,  but the p-values  suggested  that 
these data were statistically significant. This suggested that 
regardless  of  the  existence  of  S/MAR,  there  were 
significant associations of genes related in  a certain cellular 
events  on  the  genome.  The  clustering  of  housekeeping 
genes  in  human  genomes  has  been  reported,  with 
suggestion  that  it  might  be  advantageous  to  assemble 
housekeeping  genes  on  some  'common  ground'  that 
remains  in  an  open  conformation  across  all  cells  (Lercher 
eta/.,  2002).  The  analysis  of co-expressed  genes 
suggested  the  possibilities  of  grouping  genes  as  a 
functional  module  (Thompson  et a/.,  2002),  and  the 
accumulation of such data will  resolve the  relation  between 
the  genomic  association  of  genes  and  their functional 

significance.  Additionally,  more  analyses  on  the  link 
between  the  higher-order  chromatin  structure,  and  the 
gene  clustering  on  the  genome,  should  be  addressed  to 
prove this relationship. 

Despite  the  inadequacy  of  the  annotation  information, 
this  study  has  shown  the  significant  association  of 
neighboring genes with identical function sub-categories on 
chromosomes 4 and 5 of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. 
Using all the information on genome annotation from  large(cid:173)
scale  functional  genomics,  the  application  of  this  strategy 
will  reveal  detailed  and  unbiased  results,  which 
complement experimental knowledge. 

Materials and Methods 
Data sources  of Arabidopsis thaliana  genome 
sequences and function annotation 
Among  five  chromosomes  of Arabidopsis  thaliana  we 
selected  the  chromosome  4  and  5  as  the  subject  for 
analysis,  as  they  are  richer  in  annotation  than  the  other 
three.  The  complete  sequences  of  the  two  chromosomes 
were  retrieved  from  the  GenBank  (Accession  No. 
NC_003075.1  and  NC_003076.2),  and  the  function 
annotation  information  was  retrieved  from  the  Munich 
Information  of  Protein  Sequences  website  (MIPS; 
http://mips.gsf.de/cgi-bin/proVthal/search_funcat).  From  the 
GenBank flatfile,  the  features  describing  the  sequence 
position  and  Arabidopsis  Genome  Initiative  (AGI)  code 
were extracted,  and the AGI  code  linked to the  annotation 
information  and  function  category  code  from  MIPS,  such 
as  enzyme  category  (EC)  code.  We  used  the  function 
category codes, which subdivided 1 09 sub-categories from 
nineteen larger primary categories, including one additional 
customized category  'not found  in the MAtDB,'  which was 
assigned the code  ·oo·  . This information was saved in the 
form of a dictionary using an in-house program. 

Collecting bigrams and trigrams 
Pairs  of two  consecutive  genes  were  collected  from 
chromosomes  4  and  5  of Arabidopsis  thaliana,  and  we 
refer to them as bigram in this study. Using similar strategy, 
three  consecutive  genes  were  collected,  which  we  called 
trigrams.  All  the  bigrams and trigrams were  extracted from 
each  frame  according  to  their starting  point.  For example, 
bigrams  from  frame  1 were  composed  of the  first-second, 
third-fourth,  and  so  on,  but  those  from  frame  2  were 
composed  of  the  second-third,  fourth-fifth,  and  so  on.  We 
mapped  function  category  code  for the  genes  in  the 
bigram  and trigram  using AGI  code-function category code 
linking  dictionary,  then  sorted  them  according  to  the 
number of  function  codes,  and  collected  the  ones  not 
containing  any' 98:  Classification  not  yet  clear-cut'  ,  '99: 

48  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1 (1) 40-49, September 2003 

Unclassified  proteins' , or  '00:  Not found  in  MAtDB' . The 
bigrams  and  trigrams  having  an  identical  function  sub(cid:173)
category were counted. 

Prediction  of scaffold/matrix  attached  region 
(S/MAR) loci 
For the  extraction  of  S/MAR  motif weight  matrices,  we 
used  S/MARt  DB  Professional  2.1  (Biobase  GmbH, 
Germany;  Release  date:  Jan.  21,  2002).  We  collected  55 
entries  corresponding  to  dicotyledonous  plants,  including 
13 from  Arabidopsis  thaliana,  from  a total  of  377  entries, 
and made them the subject for extracting the pattem of the 
16-bp  AWWRTMNNWWGNNNC and  8-bp MTMYM 
sequences,  which  were  reported  as  the  MAR/SAR 
recognition  signature,  (MRS)-1  and  MRS-2,  respectively 
(Van  Drunen  and  Van  Oriel eta/.,  1999). The  MRS-1  and 
MRS-2  matching  sequences  were  extracted  using  the 
MATCH™  program  of  TRANSFAC  Professional  6.2 
(Biobase  GmbH,  Germany),  with  a default  motif core 
similarity  of  75%.  Their weight  matrices  were  generated, 
using  the  MATCH™  Profiler program,  from  79  MRS-1  and 
19  MRS-2  matching  sequences.  The  MRS  were  used  as 
they  give  the  advantage  of  increasing  the  chance  of 
uncovering  the  S/MAR  data  that  would  otherwise  be 
unavailable, and the enrichment of the  MRS is higher than 
any other  S/MAR motifs  in  experimentally confirmed 
sequences  (Liebich  and  Wingender eta/.,  2002).  We 
selected the flanking  sequences between  non-overlapping 
genes  as  the  targets  tor  S/MAR  prediction,  but  did  not 
consider  the  S/MAR  inside  the  coding  sequences.  These 
flanking  sequences  were  extracted  using  positional 
information  from  the  feature  part  of  the  GenBank flatfile. 
From  these  flanking  sequences,  both  the  MRS-1  and 
MRS-2  residing  within  200  bp  were  colleted,  without 
considering  their orientation,  using  the  MATCH™  program 
with  a  cutoff  value  of  FN50  (MRS-1:  93%,  MRS-2: 
98.75%). 

Collecting  bigrams  and  trigrams  considering 
S/MAR 
For each predicted S/MAR, containing flanking sequences, 
the  bigrams and trigrams at positions just before and  after 
S/MAR  were collected.  In  addition,  bigrams that predicted 
where the S/MAR resides were also collected. We mapped 
the  function  category  codes  on  these  bigrams  and 
trigrams,  and  then  counted  those  that  were  functionally 
identical. 

Statistical significance of bigrams and trigrams 
To  assess  the  statistical  significance,  p-values  were 
calculated  for the functionally  identical  bigrams.  According 
to the Ge eta/., (2001) (Ge and Vidal et at.,  2001 ), p-values 

tor protein-protein  interactions  in Saccaromyces cerevisiae 
were  evaluated  assuming  each  pair  has  the  same 
probability - i.e.  a uniform  random  distribution.  We applied 
this  concept  with  some  modification,  due to  the  bias  in 
some  of the  distribution  of function  categories  in  the 
Arabidopsis  thaliana  genome.  We  calculated  of p-values, 
excluding  unknown  function  categories,  but considered 
sets  of  genes  with  known  function  categories,  which  we 
called K. 

The  algorithm  tor the p-values  of the  weighted  random 

distribution is as follows: 
1. Estimate probabilities tor each function sub-category of K. 

A.  Count all  the  bigrams  (or trigrams)  for which  both  (or 
all)  gene  functions  are  known,  N,  and  count  the 
respective frequencies tor each sub-category. 

B. Divide  each  frequency  by  the  total  number of 
available bigrams (or trigrams). The calculated results 
are the estimated probabilities. 

2. Sum  all  the  probabilities  obtained  to  give  the  total 
probability of  all  the  functionally  identical  bigrams  (or 
trigrams), p. 

3.  Use a normal approximation to a binomial distribution to 
calculate p-values:  Let  I  be  the  binomial  random 
variable, with parameters p and io  being the true number 
of  identical  bigrams  (or trigrams)  in  the  data.  The 
corresponding p-value is then given by the formula: 

p=P(I>io)=  LNC;pi(l-pt-i 

N 

i=io+l 

With  respect  to p,  the  expected  number of  tunction!liiY 
identical bigrams (or trigrams) is pN,  and I is approximately 
normally distributed, N(pN, p (1-p )N). Hence, 

P r::J p[z > ----;=i~o =-=p=N=) 

~p(l- p)N 

where z is a standard normal variable. 
To  show the  distribution  of the  functional  combination 
among  neighboring  genes,  bigrams  were  assigned on  the 
matrix  according  to  their  nineteen  large  function  category 
codes.  The  frequencies  of  bigrams  were  normalized  by 
scaling  them  down  to  1 000  pairs,  and  figured  out  as  a 
twelve-color scale.
