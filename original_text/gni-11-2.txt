Until recently, since the Human Genome Project, the general view has been that the majority of the human genome is 
composed of junk DNA and has little or no selective advantage to the organism. Now we know that this conclusion is an 
oversimplification. In April 2003, the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) launched an international research 
consortium  called  Encyclopedia  of  DNA  Elements  (ENCODE)  to  uncover  non-coding  functional  elements  in  the  human 
genome. The result of this project has identified a set of new DNA regulatory elements, based on novel relationships among 
chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, transcription, and the occupancy 
of sequence-specific factors. The project gives us new insights into the organization and regulation of the human genome 
and epigenome. Here, we sought to summarize particular aspects of the ENCODE project and highlight the features and data 
that have recently been released. At the end of this review, we have summarized a case study we conducted using the 
ENCODE epigenome data.

Introduction

The  Human  Genome  Project  was  started  in  1990  and 
completed by the International Human Genome Sequencing 
Consortium  in  April  2003  [1].  Even  though  the  human 
whole  genome  sequencing  was  one  of  the  biggest  achie-
vements in human genetics, still more remains to be done. In 
September  2003,  the  National  Human  Genome  Research 
Institute (NHGRI) launched an international research group 
called  Encyclopedia  of  DNA  Elements  (ENCODE)  to 
identify all functional regulatory regions across the entire 
human genome [2]. For this project, an international group 
of 442 members from 32 institutions studied 147 different 
types  of  cells  with  24  types  of  different  experiments 
(http://www.genome.gov/ENCODE) [3, 4]. The ENCODE 
project  consists  of  a  pilot  and  a  technology  development 
phase  [5].  Methods  used  for  the  first  phase  were  mainly 
chromatin  immunoprecipitation  (ChIP)  and  quantitative 
PCR. A set of regions, corresponding to 30,000 kilobases 
(~1% of whole human genome), have been targeted [6]. The 
studies highlighted the success on characterizing functional 

elements in the human genome and were published in June 
2007 in Nature [6] and Genome Research [7]. In the second 
phase  of  this  project,  several  new  advanced  technologies 
were  employed  to  gain  higher  accuracy  and  increase 
coverage. The key technology was so-called next-generation 
sequencing. Many software tools were developed within the 
ENCODE  project,  such  as  Clustered  Aggregation  Tool 
(CAGT) [8]. This tool has been applied to the datasets of 
chromatin  marks  and  transcription  factors  to  generate  a 
comprehensive  archive  of  histone  modifications  and 
nucleosome positioning around transcription factor binding 
sites. On September 5, 2012, the results of the ENCODE 
studies  were  published  in  30  papers  in  Nature,  Genome 
Research, and Genome Biology to express 5 years of progress 
toward  the  goal  of  the  project  [9].  The  subjects  of  the 
ENCODE project to date include:

- Transcription factor motifs
- Chromatin patterns at transcription factor binding sites
- Characterization of intergenic regions and gene defini-

tion

-  RNA  and  chromatin  modification  patterns  around

a lot to our present knowledge of cell-type selective patterns 
of  methylation  associated  with  genomic  occupancy  of 
transcriptions  factors  [17].  The  ENCODE  team  has 
identified the specific patterns of post-translational histone 
modifications (e.g., H3K36me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3) 
by  ChIP  sequencing  technique  [6].  Then,  histone  modi-
fications have been connected to the regulatory regions, such 
as promoters, enhancers, transcribe domains, and silenced 
regions [6, 11]. The maps of various histone modifications 
have been constructed genomewide in different cell lines.

What  Did  the  ENCODE  Discover  about  the 
Genome?
Accessible (open) chromatin

Until  recently,  it  was  generally  believed  that  80%  of 
human  genome  was  noncoding  or  junk  DNA  [10]  and 
regulatory regions located in close proximity of genes to be 
expressed. The ENCODE project estimated that 2.94% of 
the whole human genome was protein coding, while 80.4% 
of sequences governed how those genes are regulated [11]. 
Open chromatin regions (nucleosome-depleted regions that 
are sensitive to cleavage by the DNase I enzyme) have been 
widely  used  to  identify  active  DNA  regulatory  elements, 
including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and 
locus control regions [12, 13]. Open chromatin has been 
mapped by two approaches. A total of 2.89 million DNase 
hypersensitive sites (DHSs) mapped by DNase I digestion, 
followed by next-generation sequencing in 125 cell types and 
4.8 million sites across 25 cell types that exhibited reduced 
nucleosomal crosslinking, were mapped based on formal-
dehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements assay [11]. 
On average, approximately 200,000 DHSs were found to be 
active in any one cell [14]. Open chromatin regions have 
different proportions, based on their genomic location, and 
they  cover  approximately  2%  of  the  genome  [15].  Open 
chromatin regions are enriched for regulatory information 
and located at or near transcription start sites [6]. 

DNA methylation and histone modification

The methylation status for the ENCODE cell lines has 
been  obtained  by  three  techniques:  1)  sodium  bisulfite 
conversion, 2) reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, 
and  3)  methylation-sensitive  restriction  enzyme  (methyl- 
seq). They profiled the DNA methylation status of over than 
one million CpG in all ENCODE cell lines and have provided 
quantitative  determination  of  the  proportion  of  CpG 
methylation at each site [5, 11, 16-18]. The result has added 

In contrast to histone modifications, which are identified 
by ChIP-seq, nucleosome positioning data were generated 
without  immunoprecipitation  by  using  micrococcal  nu-
clease  digestion  followed  by  sequencing  [19-21].  The 
method that distinguishes nucleosome positioning is based 
on the ability of nucleosomes to protect related DNA from 
digestion  by  enzyme  [22].  Protected  fragments  are  se-
quenced  to  produce  genomewide  maps  of  nucleosome 
localization. By using a new tool, the ENCODE project has 
identified  the  differences  in  patterns  of  nucleosome  po-
sitioning around the majority of transcription factor binding 
sites [8]. These data have tremendous value for analyzing 
the  relationship  between  transcription  factor  binding, 
histone modifications, and gene expression regulation.

Transcription factors

Transcription  factors  can  bind  to  DNA  and  alter  the 
expression  of genes  [23].  The ENCODE  Consortium  has 
detected  45  million  different  events  where  transcription 
factors occupy DNA across 41 diverse cell types [16]. For 
this,  high-throughput  sequencing  (ChIP-seq)  technology 
was applied to create occupancy maps for binding sites for a 
variety of DNA binding factors [5]. The architecture of the 
network  of  human  transcription  factors  was  found  to  be 
quite complex [24].

Annotation of the outputs of genomewide 
association studies

A  large  number  of  polymorphisms  associated  with 
increased risks of certain diseases or particular quantitative 
traits  have  been  discovered  by  genomewide  association 
studies.  The  identified  genetic  markers  or  risk  variants, 
mostly composed of single nucleotide polymorphisms, were 
enriched within the genomic regions that were previously 
thought to be ‘junk DNA’ [11, 16, 17, 24-28]. The results of 
the ENCODE project have demonstrated that variants that 
fall in regulatory regions could indirectly influence coding 
genes linked to diseases or clinical traits. With the DHS map 
in hand, a research group studied more than 5,500 genome-

wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs). The result of their research revealed that 
approximately 75% of GWAS diseases- and trait-associated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). are concentrated in 
or near DNase I hypersensitive sites [29]. Together, they give 
new insights to the researchers who are carrying out GWASs. 

A case epigenomic study based on the ENCODE 
data

All ENCODE data are freely available for download and 
analysis.  The  ENCODE  website  at  the  University  of 
California  Santa  Cruz  (UCSC)  genome  browser  (http:// 
encodeproject.org  or  http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE) 
provides information about how to access the data. More 
than 100 researchers who were not part of the ENCODE 
project have used the ENCODE data for their studies. We 
had a question about the conflicts between the openness of 
transcription  factor  binding  regions  and  the  existence  of 
histones  for  various  modifications.  Whereas  regulatory 
DNA  elements  underlying  open  chromatin  are  made 
accessible by nucleosome-depleted states, the presence of 
nucleosomes is required for specific histone modifications 
that  mediate  the  specific  regulation  of  open  chromatin 
regions [30]. To handle this question, we downloaded the 
data for chromatin accessibility (DHS), in vivo nucleosome 

occupancy, 15 chromatin states, histone modifications, and 
transcription  factor  binding  sites  for  the  GM12878 
lymphoblastoid cell line from the ENCODE tracks of the 
UCSC  genome  browser.  We  discovered  the  presence  of 
boundary nucleosomes just inside of open chromatin (black 
curve  in  Fig.  1A).  In  vivo  nucleosomes  that  were  recon-
stituted purely based on naked DNA [21, 31] also peaked 
right inside of open chromatin (gray shade in Fig. 1A). The 
corresponding DNA sequences displayed an increase in the 
C/G  dinucleotide  frequency  (red  dots  in  Fig.  1B)  and  a 
significant decrease in the A/T dinucleotide frequency (blue 
dots in Fig. 1B), exhibiting nucleosome- favoring features. 
However,  there  was  a  difference  in  the  peak  position 
between  the  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  nucleosomes,  indicating 
cellular  reprogramming  of  sequence-encoded  nucleosome 
positioning. The similar patterns were found in yeast (data 
not  shown  here).  This  evolutionarily  conserved  feature 
provides  a  platform  for  histone  modifications  associated 
with  promoters  and  enhancers.  We  examined  histone 
modification levels for the regulatory areas whose borders 
were occupied by DNA-encoded nucleosomes and those that 
were  free  of  nucleosome  sequences.  Among  15  different 
chromatin states [30], active promoters, poised promoters, 
and  strong  enhancers  tended  to  contain  nucleosome- 
encoding  sequences.  Highest  enrichment  was  found  for

poised promoters, and the lowest percentage was found with 
heterochromatin  states.  All  these  data  indicate  intrinsic 
nucleosome positioning present in the regulatory regions 
that are frequently accessed or poised for later activation but 
are not supposed to be silent. As with other ENCODE data 
users, the main goal of our study was to add a few more new 
directions to the ENCODE epigenetics road map.

Conclusion 

The ENCODE project results have dramatically increased 
our  knowledge  about  chromatin  and  its  regulation.  The 
results have forced us to think better about genetics. The 
ENCODE consortium has developed multiple technologies 
and approaches to discover the functional elements encoded 
in the human genome. This project generated more than 15 
trillion bytes of raw data, mapping diverse chromatin pro-
perties in several cell types. Data generated by the ENCODE 
project  are  freely  available  and  have  been  used  by  many 
researchers. By using the ENCODE data, we discovered the 
presence  of  boundary  nucleosomes  for  specific  histone 
modifications in open chromatin. Although the ENCODE 
project  has  provided  a  unique  and  informative  window 
through which to view evolutionary change, it has looked 
only at 147 types of cells, and the human body has 1,000 cell 
types.  The  project  is  just  the  start  of  a  long  journey  to 
understanding the mysteries of our genome.
