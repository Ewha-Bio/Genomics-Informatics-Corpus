We had analyzed 10 exome sequencing data and single nucleotide polymorphism chips for blood cancer provided by the 
PGM21 (The National Project for Personalized Genomic Medicine) Award program. We had removed sample G06 because the 
pair is not correct and G10 because of possible contamination. In-house software somatic copy-number and heterozygosity 
alteration  estimation  (SCHALE)  was  used  to  detect  one  loss  of  heterozygosity  region  in  G05.  We  had  discovered  27 
functionally important mutations. Network and pathway analyses gave us clues that NPM1, GATA2, and CEBPA were major 
driver genes. By comparing with previous somatic mutation profiles, we had concluded that the provided data originated 
from acute myeloid leukemia. Protein structure modeling showed that somatic mutations in IDH2, RASGEF1B, and MSH4 can 
affect protein structures.

Introduction

Thanks to the next-generation sequencing (NGS) tech-
nology, genomics research area has been developed drama-
tically in recent years. Since 2008, many efforts have been 
made  to  find  somatic  mutations  in  cancer  genomes; 
hundreds of samples by exome sequencing have been used to 
develop diagnosis and prognosis markers in various cancers 
in recent researches. Cheaper price has enabled us to get 
more  exome  sequencing  data  from  hundreds  of  samples, 
even thousands of genomes.

By applying exome sequencing to cancer genomes, we can 
discover  somatic  mutations  and  somatic  copy-number 
alterations (SCNAs) on a massive and genome-wide scale. 
Traditionally,  array-based  comparative  genomic  hybridi-
zation  has  been  used  to  discover  SCNA,  but  exome  se-
quencing  has  many  advantages,  in  that  one  can  derive 
various  results,  such  as  somatic  mutations,  loss  of  hete-
rozygosity (LOH), and SCNA. It is still under debate because 
bioinformatics methods could give different results depen-
ding  on  their  parameters  and  software,  but  major  driver 
genes of somatic mutations show a similar consensus.

We  had  used  an  in-house  bioinformatics  pipeline  and 
databases for this research, especially “somatic copy-number 
and heterozygosity alteration estimation” (SCHALE) to find 
LOH  and  SCNA.  Furthermore,  driver  genes  were  also 
inferred  from  network  and  pathway  analyses.  Protein 
structure prediction was used to predict putative structural 
changes  by  somatic  mutations  and  also  possibly  their 
functional changes.

Methods
Dataset

Whole-exome sequencing data of tumor/normal paired 
samples  from  10  individuals  with  blood  cancer  were 
obtained  in  FASTQ  format  from  PGM21  (The  National 
Project for Personalized Genomic Medicine). For 10 of the 
samples, the genotype information from single nucleotide 
poymorphism (SNP) chip was additionally obtained (but not 
the raw data).

Data processing and quality control (QC)

The QC of sequencing reads was performed with NGS QC

Toolkit,  and  the  high-quality  reads  were  aligned  to  the 
human reference genome (hg19, http://genome.ucsc.edu) 
using BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/) [1] with de-
fault  parameteres.  Picard  (http://picard.  sourceforge.net) 
was  used  to  remove  PCR  duplicates.  Base  quality  recali-
bration and local realignment around indels were performed 
using Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK, http://www. broa-
dinstitute.org/gatk/). Because our previous study showed 
that the discordance of indel alignments had potential to 
generate false-positive somatic mutations, we performed the 
local realignment after the merging of alignments from same 
patients. Template lengths were calculated using the pro-
cessed alignments, and the distributions for each samples 
were plotted to examine the qualities of sequencing libraries. 
Variant  genotyping  for  each  sample  was  performed  with 
UnifiedGenotyper of GATK, and the variants were filtered as 
follows: mapping quality zero (MQ0) ≥ 4 && MQ0/depth of 
coverage (DP) ＞ 0.1, variation quality (QUAL) ＜ 200, qua-
lity by depth (QD) ＜ 5, Fisher strand (FS) ＞ 60, MQ ＜ 40, 
DP ＜ 10 (5 if no variant allele), genotype quality (GQ) ＜ 13. 
The  genomic  annotation  of  variants  was  performed  with 
custom-made scripts and refSeq information. 

Identification of somatic mutations

We had developed a bioinformatics pipeline for this award 
program (Fig. 1). VarScan [2] was used to identify somatic 
mutations. The output of VarScan was filtered as follows: 
somatic p-value  ≤ 0.05, normal allele depth  ≤ 1, tumor 
allele depth ≥ 5, tumor total depth ≥ 10. The mutation set 
was annotated using a custom-made script with refSeq, SIFT 
(http://sift.jcvi.org/), MutationAssessor, phyloP46way (ver-
tebrate), dbSNP 137 [3], in-house Korean variation data-
base, etc. We selected the driver mutations that were not in 
dbSNP 137, excluding clinically associated variants (Flagged 
track in University of California Santa Cruz [UCSC] Genome 
Browser) and an in-house Korean variation database, and 
were deleterious missense, nonsense, read-through, splice- 
site, or coding indel mutations (NS/SS/I). The deleterious 
missense mutations were determined if at least 2 out of the 
following 3 were true: PhyloP score ＞ 1.5, SIFT prediction = 
deleterious,  MutationAssessor  Func.  Impact  =  high  or 
medium.

The total numbers of candidates for each filtering step are 
summarized  in  Fig.  1.  We  found  somatic  mutations  in 
samples G10, G08, and G09, but they were not NS/SS/I.

Comparison with genotypes from SNP chip

To  compare  with  genotypes  from  SNP  chip,  the  geno-
typing  was  performed  using  UnifiedGenotyper  with  the 
intervals, including all the coordinates of SNP chip and the 
option-output_mode  EMIT_ALL_SITES.  For  each  sample 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

with genotype information from SNP chip, overall genotype 
concordance,  non-reference  sensitivity,  and  non-reference 
discrepancy rate were calculated according to the guide of 
GATK VariantEval using the genotypes with DP ≥ 5.

Genotype comparison of samples

The multi-sample SNP genotyping was performed with 
UnifiedGenotyper to compare the genotypes on the variant 
positions where all samples were able to be genotyped. The 
filtration  scheme  was  the  same  as  above.  The  distance 
between two samples was calculated as the sum of genotype 
difference  values  (0  if  two  genotypes  are  same,  1  if  a 
genotype is 0/1 and another is 0/0 or 1/1, 2 if a genotype is 
0/0 and another is 1/1). The distances were divided by the 
number  of  the  variant  positions.  Heatmap  and  similarity 
matrix were used to visualize the distances.

Detection of LOH and SCNA by SCHALE

Detection LOH and SCNA was performed with custom- 
made software SCHALE (Fig. 2). For the positions where the 
genotypes were heterozygous in normal samples, the values 
of LOH and SCNA were calculated. The values of LOH were 

calculated by the equation:
LOH = | RT ‒ 0.5 | － | RN ‒ 0.5 |, where RN is the count 
of reads supporting a non-reference allele divided by the total 
depth in the normal sample and RT is in tumor sample. The 
values of SCNA were calculated by the equation:

SCNA  =  log2(tumor  depth/normal  depth),  where  the 
depths  were  normalized  using  R  library  tweeDEseq.  The 
values of LOH and SCNA were segmented together using R 
library  DNAcopy  with  the  parameters  alpha  =  0.01  and 
undo.SD = 2. The segments and values were plotted for each 
chromosome with the idiograms in R library SNPchip.

Network analysis

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to perform the 
network study of the identified somatically mutated genes 
and the genes in the LOH region.

Protein structure modeling

Before  the  structural  modeling,  the  protein  features 
related to the somatic mutations were found by BLAST on 
UniProt  (10  most  similar  proteins,  expectation  value  = 
1e-30)  and  residue  mapping.  Homology  modeling  was 
performed using MODELLER (http://salilab.org/modeller) 
with the templates 1LWD for IDH2, 3KSY for RASGEF1B,

using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org/).

Results
QC and results

We had used several methods to check the qualities of 
sequence reads. First, we used NGS QC Tools [4] to confirm 
sequence qualities (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, they 
had a very good quality, according to NGS QC Tools results. 
Template length (library size) was also evenly distributed for 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

all samples (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Reference genome mapping

About  98%  of  reads  were  mapped  onto  the  human 
reference  genome  (UCSC  Genome  Browser,  hg19),  sum-
marized in Supplementary Table 2. After a duplicate removal 
step, 77‒85% reads were retained; each sample had up to 
25% duplicates. Eighty-nine percent of target areas covered 
at least 10 sequence reads, which is sufficient for discovering 
somatic  mutations. We  did not  get  target  enrichment  kit 
information  from  PGM21,  so  we  had  compared  coverage 
information from several kits and concluded that SureSelect 
All Exon 50Mb was used for exome sequencing.

Genotyping by GATK and comparison with SNP chip

In order to check the genotyping parameters we had used, 
10 SNP chip results were compared. Because SNP chip data 
were genotypes, we could not infer copy number changes; we 
could only calculate concordance between exome sequen-
cing and SNP chip. We had used a separate bioinformatics 
pipeline for checking concordance, and GATK [5] was used 
mainly  for  genotyping  of  germline  samples.  We  had 
discovered  18,500‒19,200  coding  SNPs.  The  number  of 
SNPs from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) was close to 
that of the 3' UTR, so the target enrichment kit was not the 
latest 3' UTR extension version (Supplementary Table 3). In 
general, the 3' UTR is much larger than the 5' UTR; a new 3' 
UTR extension version of the exome kit will give at least a 
few times more SNPs than 5' UTR.

Two  hundred  fifty  coding  SNPs  were  retained  after 
removal of dbSNP137 [6] and an in-house Korean database 
comprised of 54 normal individuals. Among them, we can 
focus on about 160 variants of NS/SS/I, which is believed to 
be most functionally important (Supplementary Table 4). 

Overall  concordance  was  at  least  99.6%.  In  recent 
personal genome papers, they reported more than 99.95% 
concordance  between  whole-genome  and  SNP  chips. 
Usually, one can achieve higher concordance if he uses strict 
parameters for their genotyping. Our purpose is to discover 
somatic mutations, not genotyping of normal germline, so 
we did not put much effort to get higher concordance values.
Especially,  G10.N  SNP  chip  data  were  totally  different 
from  the exome,  because  only  77% of  SNPs  were  shared 
(Supplementary Table 5). As one can see in the table, 77% 
means they are different individuals (false positive for Award 
program). Distance and similarity matrix were calculated to 

see the differences and similarity (Supplementary Table 6, 
Supplementary Fig. 2). We had concluded that sample G06 
has a different sample pair from different individuals. G10 
also has only 92% similarity and showed a little similarity 
between G03 and G04. For such reasons, G10 was possibly 
contaminated  and  therefore  rejected  from  our  bioin-
formatics analysis.

In  conclusion,  we  had  used  only  8  sample  pairs  for 

discovery of somatic mutations, LOH, and SCNA.

an in-house Korean database, 27 somatic mutations (NS/ 
SS/I) were discovered from 8 samples. Among them, NPM1 
showed  a  TCTG  internal  tandem  insertion.  NPM1-ITD  is 
known to be major driver gene in acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML)  (Table  1,  Supplementary  Table  7).  NPM1-ITD  and 
GATA2  were  recurrently  found  in  two  samples.  We  had 
removed all variants from dbSNP and an in-house Korean 
database that showed polymorphisms or normal variants, 
because they can be putatively functionally neutral, even if 
they are discovered as somatic mutations.

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

We had downloaded the COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac. 
uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/)  database  and  compared  with 
our somatic mutations. We found the same highly recurrent 
somatic  mutation  variants  in  four  genes:  NPM1,  IDH2, 
CEBPA, and GATA2.

In 26 genes, we can easily see the NPM1, IDH2, GATA2, 
CEBPA  genes―known  to  be  highly  mutated  in  AML  [3]. 
Based on the recent somatic mutation profiles from exome 
sequencing, one can see the following trends of them. In 
solid  tumors,  somatic  mutation  in  TP53  is  high.  But  in 
melanoma, BRAF mutation is high. In hepatocellular car-
cinoma, CTNNB1 mutation is high. It means that somatic 
mutations can play a different role, depending on cancer. In 
AML,  other  than  the  well-known  TP53  mutation,  genes, 
such as FLT3, TET2, and NPM1, show somatic mutations and 
are the driver genes [7].

Discovery of LOH and SCAN by SCHALE

We  had  used  SCHALE  to  discover  LOH  and  SCNA.  It 
appears that sample G06 has many LOHs and SCNAs, but an 
incorrect sample pair can give those results (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). We also discovered high LOH on chrX in G10 (Fig. 3).
We  could  not  find  any  somatic  mutations  in  G10. 
Previously, we had described that it could be contamination, 
but another possibility is that they are exomes from identical 
twins with different genders (we do not have any gender 
information from any samples).

Abnormal regions on chr1 in G05 showed LOH in the 
germline,  but  it  is  quite  unnatural  (Fig.  4).  We  are  not 
describing much for this area until experimental validation is

performed.

We had found one LOH region on chr13 in G05 (Fig. 5). 
INTS6 and KIAA1704 are located at both ends and poten-
tially  could  make  a  fusion  gene  (Fig.  6).  Experimental 
validation  is  also  required  for  this  assumption.  INTS6  is 
expressed in blood; many expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 
were  found  in  INTS6  in  UniGene  (http://www.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov/UniGene). But, KIAA1704 has a small number 
of  ESTs,  so  we  could  not  infer  expression  levels  from 
UniGene.  There  are  61  genes  on  chr13:45,578,409- 
52,035,344, and we had an additional set of network and 
pathway analyses, including 6 genes (MAST2, L1TD1, MSH4, 
GATA2, VDAC2, and PHF6) with somatic mutations.

The  top  network  is  “Cancer,  Hematological  Disease, 
Immunological Disease,” comprised of GATA2 and MAST2. 

Many genes in LOH regions are included in this network. We 
can infer that those genes with somatic mutations and LOH 
can interact with each other (Fig. 7).

Network and pathway analyses

Using 26 genes, we had used IPA (http://www.ingenuity. 
com/)  [8]  for  network  and  pathway  analyses.  It  can  be 
summarized in two major networks (Table 2).

The top network is “Cancer, Hematologicial Disease, Cell 
Cycle,” and it has NPM1, GATA2, and CEBPA genes (Figs. 8 
and  9).  These  three  genes  showed  a  highly  connected 
network and well-known major driver genes in leukemia.

The second network is related to cell death and survival 
(Fig. 10). IDH2 and PHF6 genes were located in this network. 
But overall, somatic mutation frequency in the top network 

30

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

is much higher than the second network above.

IPA analysis reports are summarized in Supplementary 

Table 8.

Protein structure modeling

We have examined protein features related to residues 
substituted  by  the  identified  27  somatic  mutations  and 
found the features of 19 mutations (Table 3). The mutation 
of  CEBPA  generates  a  duplication  of  an  amino  acid  that 
affects the original helical secondary structure. The residue 
corresponding to the mutation of IDH2 has a function to bind 
with  its  substrate,  so  the  substitutions  of  the  residue 
decrease the binding affinity with the substrate. The protein 
region frame-shifted by the mutation of NPM1 is related to 
the  function  of  nuclear  localization,  important  for  main-
taining the structure. The structural modeling of RASGEF1B 
shows  that  the  mutated  residue  Arg261 generates  a new 
hydrogen  bond  with  Asn303,  affecting  the  stretch  of 
neighbor helical structures. The protein structure of MSH4 
shows that the salt bridge between Glu415 and Arg474 is 
essential for the folding and stability of the protein structure 
but is broken by the mutation (Table 4, Fig. 11).

Discussion

We have analyzed 10 exome sequencing samples and SNP 
chip data using a variety of bioinformatics methods. Accor-
ding to the concordance results, comparing with SNP chip

data, we concluded that the G10.N exome sample is not the 
correct pair. Comparing SNPs between normal and tumor 
pairs revealed that the normal-tumor pair of sample G06 was 
not matched, and the G10 exome showed abnormal LOH in 
chrX but had no somatic mutation. So, we had removed G06 
and G10 for discovering somatic mutations.

After removing G06 and G10, with 8 paired-end samples, 
we discovered 27 functionally important somatic mutations 
with significance. They included well-known genes in AML, 

such as NPM1, IDH2, GATA2, and CEBPA. Especially, NPM1 
and GATA2 were found in 2 out of 8 samples.

In sample G05, we found one abnormal region at chr1 and 
an LOH region at chr13. We could conclude that the LOH 
region could potentially make a fusion gene by INTS6 and 
KIAA1704, and we did further network analysis on that. The 
results of IPA analysis gave “Cell Death and Survival, Cell 
Cycle” network as the top network, and it includes GATA2

and MAST2 (somatic mutation).

We  had  done  IPA  analysis  with  26  genes,  giving  the 
“Cancer, Hematological Disease, Cell Cycle Network” as the 
top  network,  and  it  includes  NPM1,  GATA2,  and  CEBPA, 
which are well-known driver genes in AML [3]. Since those 
3 genes have many edges in the result, we could conclude 
that those genes are indirect evidence of driver genes.

The  second  network  is  related  with  “Cell  Death  and 
Survival,” and it includes IDH2 and PHF6 genes, the same as 
G05’s top network. So far, our conclusion is that 8 samples 
are related with the “Cancer, Hematological Disease, Cell 
Cycle Network” but sample G05 is related with the “Cell 
Death and Survival Network.”

We had searched previous works of genome-wide somatic 
mutation  discovery  and  concluded  that  8  exome  samples 
might be AML. Somatic mutation profiles of blood cancer are 
summarized in Table 5 [3, 9, 10]. But, we could not find any 
somatic  mutations  in  the  FLT3  or  RAS  gene.  Chronic 
lymphocytic  leukemia  and  Blast  Crisis  chronic  myeloid 
leukemia did not have somatic mutations in NPM1 or CEBPA.
Seven out of 8 samples showed neither LOH nor SCNA, so 
we  could  conclude  that  those  patients  had  a  normal 
karyotype  with  no  translocation  or  inversion.  If  possible, 
additional RNA-Seq experiments or another technique can 
provide enough evidence of karyotypes of those samples. 

In CEBPA, IDH2, and NPM1, we saw somatic mutations 
located in helix regions. By using protein structure mode-
ling, we found that IDH2, RASGEF1B, and MSH4 could have 
structural  variations,  affecting  protein  functions.  Somatic 
mutations in IDH2 could break hydrogen bonds.
