Spatial folding of the DNA double helix into a chromatin 
structure and their dynamic interactions within the nucleus 
are  important  for  regulating  gene  transcription  and  con-
trolling the fate of cells during development. Regarding this 
issue, Dr. Tae-You Kim’s group (Seoul National University 
Hospital,  Korea)  has  comprehensively  reviewed  recent 
knowledge  about  the  roles  of  CCCTC-binding  factor  and 
cohesion in genome folding, their biological implications for 
gene expression, and their association with human diseases. 
This  information  could  be  very  useful  for  CRISPR/Cas9- 
based  epigenome  editing  technology,  which  is  another 
attractive  option  for  future  epigenome-based  anticancer 
therapy. 

nymous  sites  are  generally  considered  to  be  functionally 
neutral. However, a number of contradictory findings have 
been  reported  recently.  For  example,  some  synonymous 
single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  have  a  similar 
effect size in disease association as nonsynonymous SNPs. 
Dr. Sun Shim Choi’s group (Kangwon National University, 
Korea) reviewed this story. They introduced evidence that 
highly  expressed  genes  tend  to  have  a  greater  preference 
toward  so-called  optimal  codons  than  lowly  expressed 
genes.  There  are  seven  original  articles  regarding  diverse 
genomics and bioinformatics research and one application 
note in this issue.
