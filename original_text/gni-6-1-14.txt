Abstract

GENDISCAN  study  (Gene  Discovery  for  Complex  traits  in 
Asian  population  of  Northeast  area)  was  designed  to  in-
corporate  methodologies  which  enhance  the  power  to 
identify  genetic  variations  underlying  complex  disorders. 
Use  of  population  isolates  as  the  target  population  is  a 
unique  feather  of  this  study.  However,  population  isolates 
may  have  hidden  inbreeding  structures  which  can  affect 
the  validity  of  the  study.  To  understand  how  this  issue 
may  affect  results  of  GENDISCAN,  we  estimated  inbreed-
ing  coefficients  in  two  study  populations  in  Mongolia.  We 
analyzed 
the  status  of  Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium 
(HWE),  polymorphism  information  contents  (PIC),  hetero-
zygosity,  allelic  diversity,  and  inbreeding  coefficients,  us-
ing  317  and  1,044  STR  (short  tandem  repeat)  markers  in 
Orkhontuul  and  Dashbalbar  populations.  HWE  assump-
tions  were  generally  met  in  most  markers  (88.6%  and 
94.2%  respectively),  and  single  marker  PIC  ranged  be-
tween  0.2  and  0.9.  Inbreeding  coefficients  were  esti-
mated  to  be  0.0023  and  0.0021,  which  are  small  enough 
to  assure  that  conventional  genetic  analysis  would  work 
without  any  specific  modification.  We  concluded  that  the 
population  isolates  used  in  GENDISCAN  study  would  not 
present  significant  inflation  of  type  I  errors  from  inbreed-
ing  effects  in  its  gene  discovery  analysis.

Introduction

The  GENDISCAN  (Gene  Discovery  for  Complex  traits  in 
Asian  population  of  Northeast  area)  study  was  launched 
in  2002  in  order  to  elucidate  genetic  causes  of  complex 
diseases.  This  study  attempted  to  incorporate  designs 
that  detect  genetic  signals  with  increased  efficiency. 
These  included  using  genetically  homogeneous  pop-
ulation,  recruiting  large  families,  and  considering  quanti-
tative  phenotypes  as  well  as  disease  outcome  (Peltonen 
et al.,  2001;  Merikangas  et al.,  2003).  Large  extended 
families  still  remaining  in  the  Northeast  Asia,  enabled 
the  project  to  adopt  these  designs. 
    Although  there  is  no  doubt  that  gene  discovery  of 
common  complex  diseases  is  one  of  the  research  prior-
ities,  the  successful  results  have  been  very  limited 
(Grant  et al.,  2006).
    The  difficulty  of  replication  across  studies,  mandates 
the  use  of  internally  valid  study  designs  and  proper 
methodologies.  Using  population  isolates  generally  con-
fers  the  advantage  of  increasing  genetic  homogeneity. 
However  population  isolates  might  have  inbreeding 
structures,  which  deviates  the  basic  assumptions  of 
HWE.  The  presence  of  significant  inbreeding  neces-
sitates  modifications  in  genetic  estimations  using  the 
population.  Therefore,  we  attempted  to  estimate  the  sta-
tus  of  HWE,  and  inbreeding  coefficients  in  two  ethnic 
groups  of  Mongolia  using  genome-wide  short  tandem 
repeat  (STR)  genetic  markers.  Compatibility  with  basic 
assumptions  of  population  genetics  can  support  the 
methodological  validity  of  the  overall  GENDISCAN  study,

Methods

Participants

The  GENDISCAN  study  included  non-selected  families  in 
Mongolia.  The  People's  Republic  of  Mongolia  (not  includ-
ing  the  Chinese  territory)  has  2.6  million  people  which 
comprise  of  more  than  20  ethnic  groups.  The  Orkhontuul 
are  in  Selenge  Imag  (Imag  is  an  administrative  district 
unit  in  Mongolia  corresponding  to  a  state  in  the  United 
States)  and  the  Dashbalbar  area  in  Dornod  Imag  were 
selected.  The  Orkhontuul  area  has  a  population  of  3,760 
people,  mainly  consisting  of  Khalkha  tribe,  and  maintains 
semi-urban  life  style.  The  Dashbalbar  area  is  mainly  habi-
tuated  by  about  4,000  people  of  Buryat  ethnicity  and  has 
more  traditional  nomadic  life  style.  Many  large  extended

calculated  from  Equation  2.

Genotyping

Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  peripheral  leukocytes. 
The  Orkhontuul  samples  (2004,  n=1,080)  were  geno-
typed  using  the  Applied  Biosystems  Inc.  platform  (ABI 
PrismTM  Linkage  Mapping  Set  version  2.5  medium  den-
sity,  400  markers)  with  average  10  cM  resolution,  and 
Dashbalbar  samples  (2006,  n=1,020)  were  genotyped 
using  the  deCODE  1,000  STR  marker  platform  with 
average  of  3  cM  resolution.  For  the  Orkhontuul  partic-
ipants  markers  on  the  chromosome  1∼4  were  analyzed. 
For  Orkhontuul  data,  markers  with  low  call-rate  (49 
markers),  and  with  more  than  1%  of  genotype  error 
rates  (16  markers)  and  markers  on  X  chromosome  (18 
markers)  were  excluded.  For  Dashbalbar  genotype  data, 
the  1,000  STR  marker  platform  provided  1097  markers 
originally,  however  we  excluded  markers  on  X  chromo-
some  (49  markers)  and  markers  with  low  call-rate  and 
more  than  1%  of  genotype  error  rates  (4  markers).  All 
participants  provided  informed  consent.

(HWE), 
Estimating  Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium 
Information  Contents  and  Inbreeding  Coefficients

HWE  and  degree  of  inbreeding  were  assessed  using  the 
founders  of  each  pedigree.  Non-founders  were  excluded 
because  their  genotypes  are  dependent  on  those  of  the 
founders.  HWE  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  ex-
pected  and  observed  genotype  frequencies.  Expected 
genotype  frequency  was  calculated  from  allele  fre-
quency.  Chi-square  goodness  of  fit  test  was  used  to 
determine  whether  HWE  assumption  was  met.  The 
Chi-square  statistics  (Χ2)  of  multi-allelic  loci  is  defined 
as  equation  as  Equation  1,  with  k  (k-1)  degree  of  free-
dom,  where  k  is  the  total  number  of  alleles.

(Equation  2)

where  pu  and  pv  denote  allele  frequency  of  each  allele 
(Czika,  2005).
    Inbreeding  was  estimated  by  the  deviation  from  the 
assumption  that  each  founder  shares  no  Identity  by  de-
scent  (IBD).  Generally  genotype  frequency  of  bi-allelic 
locus  having p  and q  allele  frequencies  are  predicted  as 
p2, 2pq, q2  respectively  under  HWE.  However,  if  there 
are  IBD  sharing  of  FI  between  founders,  above  pre-
diction  can  be  re-written  respectively  as  Equation  3. 

(Equation  3)

where, FI  denotes  inbreeding  coefficient  (Gillespie et al., 
2004).
    In  brief,  inbreeding  is  characterized  by  the  excess  of 
homozygote  over  expected  level.  The  inbreeding  co-
efficient  can  be  estimated  as  Equation  4  by  solving 
Equation  3 

(Equation  4)

where,  H  denotes  observed  heterozygotic,  and  2pq  de-
notes  estimated  heterozygotic  proportions  from  allele 
frequency  (Hart  et al.,  2000).
    HWE  and  estimations  of  expected  and  observed  het-
erozygosity  frequencies  were  obtained  using  SAS/Gene-
tics  program.

quency  of  each  allele.
  Information  contents  of  the  genetic  markers  were  esti-
mated  as  polymorphism  information  content  (PIC),  heter-
ozygosity  and  allelic  diversity.  PIC  is  an  index  of  the 
amount  of  information,  which  modifies  the  simple  heter-
ozygosity  index  by  adjusting  for  the  chance  of  mating 
between  the  same  heterozygotic  genotypes.  PIC  was

Discussion

typed  are  shown  in  Table  1.  There  were  280  (99  men 
and  181  women)  and  142  (90  men  and  52  women) 
founders  in  Orkhontuul  and  Dashbalbar  populations. 
Non-founders'  genotype.  were  excluded,  since  theirs  do 
not  independently  contribute  to  a  gene  pool.  The  in-
formation  contents  in  terms  of  PIC  for  single  marker, 
range  between  0.2  and  0.9,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Average 
PIC  was  0.72  and  0.71  for  Orkhontuul  and  Dashbalbar 
populations,  respectively  which  are  relatively  high  for 
single  marker  information  contents.  There  was  no  sig-
nificant  difference  in  PIC  across  the  chromosomes  or 
populations.  The  high  PIC  level  enabled  accurate  esti-
mation  of  other  population  genetic  parameters.  HWE 
was  satisfied  among  88.6  %  and  94.2%,  respectively,  of 
all  markers  in  Orkhontuul  and  Dashbalbar  populations 
(p-value  ＜0.05).  If  we  apply  the  criteria  of  p-value  0.01, 
90.5%  and  95.3%  of  all  markers  were  in  HWE  status  All 
the  markers  including  those  which  were  not  in  HWE, 
were  used  for  estimating  the  inbreeding  coefficients,. 
Inbreeding  coefficient  was  estimated  to  be  0.0023  and 
0.0021  in  Orkhontuul  and  Dashbalbar  populations. 

the  most 

ideal  populations 

  Population  isolates  are  generally  considered  to  be  one 
of 
for  genetic  study 
(Pajukanta  et  al.,  2003;  rcos-Burgos  et  al.,  2002; 
Escamilla  et al.,  2001).  However,  possible  inbreeding 
can  cause  deviation  from  general  assumptions  on  which 
most  analyses  depend.  Presence  of  inbreeding  can  be 
problematic,  because,  if  exits,  l  the  genetic  relationships 
between  unrelated  as  well  as  related  persons  could  be 
underestimated.  This  underestimation  of  IBD  can  result 
in  inflation  of  type  I  errors  for  linkage  analysis  (Hossjer 
et al.,  2006  Nomura et al.,  2005),  linkage  disequilibrium 
estimations  and  haplotype  reconstructions  (Zhang et al., 
2004).  The  inbreeding  coefficient  found  in  this  study 
(about  0.2%  in  each  population),  does  not  necessitate 
any  adjustment  for  genetic  analyses  such  as  IBD  calcu-
lation,  classic  or  non-parametric  linkage  analysis,  and 
variance  component-based  linkage  analysis.  By  estimat-
ing  the  last  common  ancestor,  0.2%  of  inbreeding  co-
efficient  corresponds  to  10  or  11  generations  (Jensen- 
Seaman  et al.,  2001;  Santos-Lopes  et al.,  2007).
    In  this  study,  both  ABI  and  deCODE  STR  markers 
were  genotyped  with  standardized  procedure  and  any 

Inbreeding  Coefficients  in  Two  Isolated  Mongolian  Populations    17

markers  with  more  than  1%  of  genotype  errors  were 
discarded.  The  genotype  errors  were  confirmed  within 
the  pedigree  structure.  Any  Mendelian  inconsistency 
was  deleted  and  markers  with  possible  double-recombi-
nation  were  also  deleted.  Generally,  genotyping  in  fam-
ily-based  study  is  more  accurate  than  in  studies  using 
individuals  only.  Thus,  It  is  not  likely  that  any  genotype 
error  could  have  been  biased  our  findings.
    In  conclusion,  we  have  estimated  inbreeding  co-
efficients  in  two  population  isolates  in  Mongolia.,.  We 
found  that  they  fall  in  negligible  range,  allowing  related 
genetic  studies  to  be  performed  without  any  mod-
ification  or  adjustment  for  possible  inbreeding  effects. 
This  finding  validates  the  ability  of  The  GENDISCAN 
study  to  add  to  the  growing  body  of  evidence  which  as-
sociates  specific  genetic  variations  with  complex 
disorders.
