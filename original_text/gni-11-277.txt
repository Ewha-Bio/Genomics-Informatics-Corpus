RNA  analysis  has  become  a  reliable  method  of  body  fluid  identification  for  forensic  use.  Previously,  we  developed  a 
combination of four multiplex quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) probes to discriminate four different body fluids (blood, semen, 
saliva, and vaginal secretion). While those makers successfully identified most body fluid samples, there were some cases of 
false positive and negative identification. To improve the accuracy of the identification further, we tried to use multiple 
markers per body fluid and adopted the NanoString nCounter system instead of a multiplex qRT-PCR system. After measuring 
tens of RNA markers, we evaluated the accuracy of each marker for body fluid identification. For body fluids, such as blood 
and semen, each body fluid-specific marker was accurate enough for perfect identification. However, for saliva and vaginal 
secretion, no single marker was perfect. Thus, we designed a logistic regression model with multiple markers for saliva and 
vaginal secretion and achieved almost perfect identification. In conclusion, the NanoString nCounter is an efficient platform 
for measuring multiple RNA markers per body fluid and will be useful for forensic RNA analysis.

Introduction

RNA analysis has emerged as a reliable method of body 
fluid identification for forensic use [1-7]. Conventionally, 
immunological, enzymatic, and chemical detection of spe-
cific protein markers is used [8-10]. For example, prostate- 
specific antigen has been used for semen and hemoglobin for 
blood identification [9, 10]. These assays provide important 
information for crime scenes, but they can provide wrong 
information  because  of  cross-reactions.  Recently,  several 
body  fluid-specific  mRNA  markers  have  been  discovered 
[1-7]:  β-spectrin  (SPTB),  porphobilinogen  deaminase 
(PBGD), and hemoglobin alpha locus 1 (HBA1) for blood; 
matrix metalloproteinase 7 and 11 (MMP7 and MMP11) for 
menstrual blood; statherin (STATH) and histatin 3 (HTN3) 
for saliva; kallikrein 3 (KLK3) and protamine 1 and 2 (PRM1 
and PRM2) for semen; and human beta-defensin 1 (HBD-1) 
and mucin 4 (MUC4) for vaginal secretion [11]. After DNA/ 

RNA  co-extraction  methods  were  applied  to  the  forensic 
field, RNA analysis has become routine forensic analysis [12, 
13]. 

RNA  expression  level  is  generally  measured  using 
reverse-transcription  and  standard  end-point  PCR  (RT- 
PCR) or quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in a forensic lab. Re-
cently,  using  microarray  platforms,  body  fluid-specific 
mRNA  markers  were  identified  at  a  genome-wide  level 
[14-16], and multiplex qRT-PCR probes of these markers 
were developed for one-step identification of body fluid type 
[7, 16]. Currently, most of the multiplex qRT-PCR assays use 
a single marker for each body fluid. However, using a single 
marker  for  each  body  fluid  may  lead  to  false  positive/ 
negative identification, as some markers are expressed in 
more than two types of body fluid [4-6]. Recently, Roeder 
and  Haas  [17]  suggested  a  novel  approach  of  using  a 
minimum of five mRNA markers for each body fluid and a 
scoring method based on multiple markers. In this regard,

the multiplex qRT-PCR system is not useful, because the 
number of fluorescent dyes in one reaction is limited. 

The  NanoString  nCounter  (NanoString  Technologies, 
Seattle, WA, USA) is a recent platform that can quantify the 
expression of hundreds of mRNAs in a single reaction using 
color-coded  molecular  barcodes  [18,  19].  NanoString 
nCounter is also known as a sufficiently robust method to 
measure  expression  in  degraded  RNA  samples,  such  as 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and crude tissue 
lysates [18, 20]. Therefore, applying NanoString nCounter 
to forensic identification of body fluids enables the digital 
quantification of multiplexed markers for each body fluid. 
In this study, we adopted the NanoString nCounter and 
designed a panel of NanoString probes for multiple markers 
for each body fluid. We tested the multiple markers in a large 
number of body fluid samples. As a result, we found that the 
new multiplexed method could improve the specificity and 
sensitivity of identification. We suggest that using multiple 
mRNA  markers  for  each  body  fluid  could  improve  the 
accuracy of body fluid identification. 

Methods
Sample collection and RNA preparation

Twelve samples for each body fluid (blood, saliva, semen, 
and vaginal secretion) were collected from healthy Korean 
volunteers with informed consent from the participants. The 
study  protocol  was  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review 
Boards  of  Chungnam  National  University  Hospital.  To 

prepare total RNA, we employed the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Extracted total RNA was analyzed using Experion 
RNA StdSens (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) to check its 
quality and quantity.

NanoString experiment

To validate the mRNA candidates as body fluid specific 
markers,  NanoString  technology  was  employed.  Color- 
coded barcodes that represented a single target mRNA were 
synthesized,  targeting  18  body  fluid-specific  mRNA  mar-
kers, and 2 endogenous controls for mRNA. Briefly, 100 ng of 
total RNA was hybridized to the barcode, and then probe- 
mRNA  complexes  were  immobilized  on  a  streptavidin- 
coated cartridge according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Subsequently, the cartridges were placed in the digital ana-
lyzer,  and  barcodes  were  counted.  All  the  counts  were 
normalized by the count of GAPDH barcodes.

Statistical analysis. 

We applied student’s t-test to evaluate the significance of 
gene expression differences between the tissue of interest 
and the other three tissues among the four body fluids. We 
applied receive operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to 
estimate the sensitivity and specificity of each marker, using 
the ROCR package [21] of R software (version 2.6.1). Again, 
the four body fluids were divided into two groups: a tissue of 
interest and the remaining three tissues among the four body 
fluids. Results with a p-value of  ＜ 0.05 were considered

in  a  reaction,  the  NanoString  nCounter  can  measure  the 
expression  of  hundreds  of  RNAs  at  once  [18].  So,  we 
adopted  the  NanoString  nCounter  as  the  multiplexed 
identification method using multiple RNA markers for each 
body fluid. 

After designing NanoString probes for 18 mRNA markers 
(four to five for each body fluid and two for controls), we 
performed NanoString nCounter assays with a total of 12 
RNA samples for each body fluid. As a result, we got a dozen 
good probes (Fig. 1) according to the following criteria: 1) p 
＜ 0.005  and  2)  body  fluid-specific  expression  pattern. 
Results of the other probes are shown in Supplementary Fig. 
1. To test the value of each marker as a body fluid-specific 
marker, we performed ROC analysis (Fig. 2). For blood- or 
semen-specific  markers,  the  identification  accuracy  was 
perfect (AUC, 1). But, for saliva and vaginal secretion, no 
single marker showed perfect accuracy (Fig. 2). 

To improve the accuracy of saliva and vaginal secretion 
identification,  we  tried  a  combination  of  markers  using 
logistic  regression  analysis  [22].  We  evaluated  the  sensi-
tivity and specificity of each marker and then evaluated the

Results 

Previously, we found a dozen mRNA markers and deve-
loped  multiplex  qRT-PCR  probes  for  body  fluid  identi-
fication [16]. But, most of the markers, except pro-platelet 
basic protein (PPBP), were not perfect in terms of area under 
the curve (AUC) value (AUC, 1). To improve the accuracy of 
identification,  we  considered  a  multiplexed  assay  using 
multiple probes for each body fluid. While  the multiplex 
qRT-PCR system is limited by the number of available dyes

performance of the combined markers (Fig. 3). For saliva and 
vaginal identification, using two markers significantly im-
proved the identification accuracy (Table 1). Therefore, we 
could identify each body fluid with multiple makers for each 
body fluid using the NanoString nCounter quite accurately.

Discussion

Previously, we developed multiplex qRT-PCR probes that 
used one specific mRNA marker for each body fluid [16]. In 
that  work,  blood  was  perfectly  identified  using  a  single 
marker, PPBP. However, for other body fluids, such as vaginal 
secretion and saliva, it was difficult to find out markers that 
perfectly  discriminated  them  from  other  body  fluids.  For 
example,  as  saliva  and  vaginal  secretion  showed  similar 
expression patterns, many selected body fluid-specific mar-
kers were expressed in both body fluids. This problem led us 
to consider a combination of multiple markers for perfect 
identification. 

A limit in the number of markers that can be assessed in 
a reaction was the biggest problem when we considered the 
use of multiple markers for each body fluid. As the number 
of different fluorescent dyes available in a qRT-PCR reaction 
is limited (i.e., five), we considered a new method that can 
measure at least 10 RNAs at once. Fortunately, the recently 
developed  NanoString  nCounter  allowed  us  to  measure 
hundreds of probes in a single reaction; so, we adopted the 
NanoString platform in our body fluid identification project. 
Measuring the expression of multiple makers per body 
fluid has a big advantage. As we have shown, by using two 
markers for each body fluid, we could identify saliva and 
vaginal  secretions  that  were  not  identified  perfectly  by  a 
single  marker.  As  we  could  identify  blood  and  semen 
perfectly using only one marker per body fluid, we conclude 
that a total of 10 markers is enough to identify four different 
body fluids in one reaction. In this regard, the NanoString 
nCounter is a promising platform that allows us to identify 
each body fluid in one reaction with high accuracy.
