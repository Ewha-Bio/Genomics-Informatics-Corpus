Abstract

How  personality  forms  and  whether  personality  genes 
exist  are  long-studied  questions.  Various  concepts  and 
theories  have  been  presented  for  centuries.  Personality 
is  a  complex  trait  and  is  developed  through  the  inter-
action  of  genes  and  the  environment.  Twin  and  family 
studies  have  found  that  there  are  critical  genetic  and 
environmental  components  in  the  inheritance  of  person-
ality  traits,  and  modern  advances  in  genetics  are  making 
it  possible  to  identify  specific  variants  for  personality 
traits.  Although  genes  that  were  found  in  studies  on 
personality  have  not  provided  replicable  association  be-
tween  genetic  and  personality  variability,  more  and  more 
genetic  variants  associated  with  personality  traits  are 
being  discovered.  Here,  we  present  the  current  state  of 
the  art  on  genetic  research  in  the  personality  field  and 
finally  list  several  of  the  recently  published  research 
highlights.  First,  we  briefly  describe  the  commonly  used 
self-reported  measures  that  define  personality  traits. 
Then,  we  summarize  the  characteristics  of  the  candidate 
genes  for  personality  traits  and  investigate  gene  variants 
that  have  been  suggested  to  be  associated  with  person-
ality  traits.

Introduction

The  modern  tools  for  the  assessment  of  personality 
have  been  developed  in  the  last  half  century.  Personality 
traits  can  be  measured  by  several  self-reported  ques-
tionnaires,  including  the  Eysenck  Personality  Question-
naire  (EPQ)  (Eysenck et al.,  1975),  the  Sixteen  Personali-
ty  Factor  Questionnaire  (16PF)  (Cattell et al.,  1970),  the 
Revised  NEO  Personality  Inventory  (NEO-PI-R)  (Costa et 
al.,  1992;  Costa et al.,  1997),  the  Temperament  and  Ch-
aracter  Inventory  (TCI)  (Cloninger  et al.,  1993),  and  the 
Tridimensional  Personality  Questionnaire  (TPQ)  (Clonin-
ger,  1987).  Most  personality  theories  and  instruments

have  large  overlaps  with  concepts  contained  in  the 
five-factor  model  using  NEO-PI-R.
　Twin,  adoption,  and  family  studies  have  demonstrated 
the  importance  of  genetic  influences  on  personality.  In  a 
twin  study,  the  heritability  estimates  for  the  NEO  (five- 
factor  model)  personality  traits  reached  between  40∼
60%  (Bouchard  et al.,  2001).  Almost  identical  results 
have  been  reported  for  the  TCI  temperament.  Further-
more,  the  shared  environment  makes  very  little  con-
tribution,  and  the  nonshared  environment  is  the  largest 
contributor  for  all  personality  traits  (Matthews  et al., 
2009).  In  adoption  studies,  the  heritability  estimates 
were  reported  to  be  lower  than  those  from  twin  studies, 
possibly  because  nonadditive  genetic  factors  may  play 
a  role  in  personality  (Bouchard  et al.,  2001).
　The  relative  influences  of  genetic  and  environmental 
factors  in  the  development  of  human  personality  have 
been  a  long-term  topic  for  an  intense  debate.  The  stud-
ies  of  personality  genetics  began  with  the  simultaneous 
publication  of  two  articles  in  1996,  showing  an  associa-
tion  between  Novelty  Seeking  and  the  D4  dopamine  re-
ceptor  gene  (Benjamin et al.,  1996;  Ebstein et al.,  1996). 
This  discovery  was  quickly  followed  by  a  report  suggest-
ing  that  activity  of  the  serotonin  transporter  protein 
(SERT)  affects  the  development  of  anxiety-related  traits 
(Lesch et al.,  1996).  The  continuing  series  urged  by  these 
reports,  however,  have  resulted  in  both  successful  and 
unsuccessful  replication  of  these  first  studies.  Although 
currently  available  data  are  not  enough  for  proof,  the 
search  for  personality  genes  is  being  continued. 
　In  the  present  study,  we  briefly  describe  the  com-
monly  used  self-reported  measures  that  define  person-
ality  traits.  Then,  we  summarize  the  characteristics  of 
the  candidate  genes  for  personality  traits  and  investigate 
gene  variants  that  have  been  suggested  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  personality  traits  for  individuals  with  behav-
ioral  outcomes  and  other  psychiatric  disorders.  The  pur-
pose  of  this  review  is  to  improve  our  understanding  of 
the  genetic  basis  of  personality.

Self-Reported  Personality  Measures

Modern  personality  research  focuses  primarily  on  per-
sonality  trait  dimensions  of  variation  between  individuals 
who  are  relatively  stable  over  time  and  predict  behavior 
in  various  domains  (Verweij  et al.,  2010).  According  to 
the  personality  theory  of  Eysenck,  there  are  three  broad 
personality  factors,  named  Neuroticism,  Extraversion- 

46    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(2)  45-51,  June  2011

includes 

Introversion,  and  Psychoticism  (Eysenck,  1967).  The  Ey-
senck  Personality  Questionnaire  (EPQ)  has  100  items 
and  has  a  48-item  short-scale  questionnaire.  Eysenck’s 
contributions  to  personality  research  was  his  formulation 
of  theories  of  the  biological  bases  of  his  personality  di-
mensions  (Eysenck,  1967).  Cattell  et al.  (1970)  used  a 
lexical  approach  by  searching  clusters  of  traits  in  the 
adjectives  people  use  to  describe  an  individual’s  per-
sonality  and  found  16  factors,  which  can  be  measured 
by  the  Sixteen  Personality  Factor  Questionnaire  (16PF). 
Using  the  same  method,  several  researchers  found  five 
robust  factors.  The  Revised  NEO  Personality  Inventory 
(NEO-PI-R)  is  questionnaire  designed  to  measure  the 
Five-Factor  Model  (FFM)  of  the  so-called  “Big  Five”  di-
mensions  of  personality  (De  Raad,  2000).  Full  NEO-PI-R 
is  a  240-item  or  shorter  scale.  Costa  and  McCrae  set 
the  most  widely  used  terminology  as  Neuroticism, 
Extraversion,  Conscientiousness,  Openness, 
and 
Agreeableness  (Costa et al.,  1992).  Neuroticism  includes 
traits,  such  as  anxiety,  depression,  and  self-confidence. 
Extraversion 
traits,  such  as  energy  and 
optimism.  The  FFM  reported  evidence  of  cross-cultural 
similarities  in  the  structure,  sex  differences,  and  age  tra-
jectories  of  the  five  factors  and  asserted  that  the  five 
factors  are  a  human  universal,  with  the  traits  being  pri-
marily  genetically  influenced  (McCrae  et al.,  2005).
　An  alternative  model,  developed  by  Cloninger,  aims  to 
reflect  the  psychobiological  etiology  of  personality  (Clo-
ninger,  1986;  Cloninger,  1987).  Cloninger’s  model  origi-
nally  consisted  of  three  dimensions  of  personality  (tem-
peraments):  Novelty  Seeking,  Harm  Avoidance,  and 
Reward  Dependence,  measured  by  the  Tridimensional 
Personality  Questionnaire  (TPQ;  Cloninger,  1986;  Clo-
ninger  et al.,  1991).  The  Temperament  and  Character 
Inventory  (TCI)  is  a  revised  model  of  TPQ  including  an 
additional  characteristic,  Persistence.  As  Cloninger  pre-
dicted,  scores  on  certain  TPQ/TCI  scales  are  associated 
with  specific  problem  behaviors  and  psychological  dis-
orders,  including  depression,  anxiety,  bipolar  disorder, 
obsessive  compulsive  disorder,  conduct  disorder,  alco-
hol  and  drug  dependence,  criminal  behavior,  and  anti-
social  personality  disorder  (Khan  et al.,  2005;  Nery  et 
al.,  2009;  Ongur  et al.,  2005).  The  TCI  has  226  items 
and  has  a  short  version  of  125  items.
　A  study  showed  that  TPQ/TCI  scales  significantly  cor-
related  with  the  NEO-PI-R  domain  scale,  demonstrating 
that  each  TPQ/TCI  scale  has  overlap  with  the  NEO-PI-R 
scale  (De  Fruyt  et al.,  2000).  Stallings  et al.  suggested 
that  TPQ/TCI  Harm  Avoidance  represents  a  45  degree 
rotation  of  EPQ  Extraversion  and  Neuroticism  most  likely 
(Stallings et al.,  1996).  In  general,  there  is  a  reasonable 
degree  of  congruence  between  the  five-factor  model 
and  personality  factors  from  a  wide  range  of  schemes 

devised  by  different  authors  with  different  theoretical  ori-
entations;  that  is,  no  matter  what  the  actual  traits  are 
named  in  other  questionnaires,  they  tend  substantially  to 
assess  some  or  all  of  the  traits  of  the  FFM  (Matthews 
et al.,  2009).

Candidate  Gene  Approach

In  molecular  genetic  studies  of  personality,  a  frequently 
used  design  is  the  candidate  gene  approach.  Since 
processes  in  the  brain  were  assumed  to  regulate  per-
sonality,  genes  involved  in  neurotransmitter  pathways 
were  primary  candidates 
(Van  Gestel  and  Van 
Broeckhoven,  2003).  In  the  psychobiological  model  of 
personality,  personality  were  hypothesized  to  be  linked 
to  the  neurotransmitter  systems,  which  are  serotonin, 
dopamine,  and  noradrenaline  (Cloninger,  1987).  These 
theoretical  assumptions  led  several  researchers  to  ex-
amine  genes 
these  specific  neurotransmitter 
pathways. 

from 

Serotonin

The  serotonin  transporter  (SERT)  gene  (also  called  5-hy-
droxytryptamine,  or  5HT)  encodes  an  integral  membrane 
protein  that  transports  the  neurotransmitter  serotonin 
from  synaptic  spaces  into  presynaptic  neurons.  Two 
SERT  polymorphisms  have  been  used  in  association 
analyses.  This  genetic  variation  is  said  to  occur  in  the 
5-HT  transporter-linked  polymorphic  region  (5-HTTLPR) 
(Deary  et al.,  1999).  The  short  allele(s)  was  associated 
with  higher  neuroticism  levels  in  a  study  of  505  sub-
jects,  whether  measured  by  the  NEO-PI-R  or  Cattell’s 
16PF  (Goldman,  1996;  Lesch  et al.,  1996).  The  allele 
was  also  associated  with  anxiety,  angry  hostility,  de-
pression,  and  impulsiveness  facets  of  NEO-PI  Neuroti-
cism  and  with  scores  for  the  TPQ  Harm  Avoidance  trait. 
Attempts  to  replicate  the  association  had  mixed  results, 
with  some  studies  confirming  the  finding  (Greenberg  et 
al.,  2000;  Katsuragi et al.,  1999;  Murakami et al.,  1999) 
and  some  not  (Ebstein et al.,  1997a;  Flory et al.,  1999; 
Gustavsson  et al.,  1999).
　The  second  extensively  studied  polymorphism  is  a 
17-bp  variable  number  tandem  repeat  (VNTR)  in  the  se-
cond  intron  of  the  5-HTT  gene.  Three  alleles  with  9,  10, 
and  12  repeats,  respectively,  have  been  characterized. 
Initially  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  polymorphism  in-
fluenced  gene  expression  (Gelernter  et al.,  1998),  but 
more  recent  studies  have  suggested  that  the  VNTR  is 
associated  with  scores  on  the  Harm  Avoidance  trait 
subscale,  measuring  fear  of  uncertainty  versus  con-
fidence  (Tsai  et al.,  2002). 
　Recently,  a  functional  magnetic  resonance  imaging 

study  supported  the  genetic  variability  of  this  site  being 
involved  in  emotion-based  personality  differences.  The 
individuals  with  the  short  allele  of  5-HTTLPR  showed 
greater  activity  in  the  right  amygdala  in  response  to 
fear-related  stimuli  (Ebstein  et al.,  1997a;  Hariri  et al., 
2002).
　Two  other  genes  from  the  serotonin  pathway  were 
studied  in  relation  to  personality:  the  serotonin  receptor 
2A  (5-HTR2A)  and  the  serotonin  receptor  2C  (5-HT2C) 
genes.  The  associations  between  5-HTR2A  and  relevant 
scores  on  the  TCI  questionnaire  were  evaluated.  Effects 
of  a  5-HTR2A  gene  marker  and  its  interaction  with  the 
GABRA6  gene  on  Harm  Avoidance  were  detected  (Alfi-
mova et al.,  2010).  A  polymorphism  of  5-HT2C  was  as-
sociated  with  the  TPQ  dimensions  Reward  Dependence, 
and  in  addition,  a  significant  interaction  effect  of  DRD4 
and  5-HT2C  on  Reward  Dependence  was  detected 
(Ebstein  et al.,  1997b).  However,  a  recent  study  in  the 
Japanese  population  did  not  provide  evidence  for  the 
association  between  5-HT2C  and  NEO-PI-R  scores 
(Tochigi  et al.,  2006).

Dopamine

Dopamine  receptors  play  a  key  role  in  many  processes, 
including  motor  behavior,  motivation,  and  working  mem-
ory  (Girault et al.,  2004).  DRD2  and  DRD4  receptors  are 
subtypes  of  dopamine  receptors,  and  their  common 
gene  polymorphisms  are  the  DRD2  TaqI  A  polymor-
phism  and  VNTR  of  DRD4  exon  III,  respectively.  A  sig-
nificant  association  was  reported  between  TPQ  Novelty 
Seeking  tendencies  and  variations  in  the  DRD4  gene 
(Cloninger et al.,  1996).  This  association  was  replicated 
across  several  studies  using  the  TPQ  and  NEO-PI-R 
(Benjamin et al.,  1996;  Tochigi et al.,  2006),  while  in  oth-
ers,  no  effect  could  be  demonstrated  in  the  healthy 
population  or  in  patients  (Gelernter et al.,  1997;  Sander 
et al.,  1997;  Sullivan  et al.,  1998).  One  study  that  in-
cluded  616  healthy  Japanese  subjects  reported  no  sig-
nificant  associations  between  the  DRD4  VNTR  poly-
morphism  and  any  TCI  score  (Tsuchimine et al.,  2009). 
The  TaqI  A  polymorphism  of  the  DRD2  gene  is  involved 
in  TPQ  Novelty  Seeking  and  Harm  Avoidance  in  anxi-
ety-depression  alcohol  dependents  (Huang et al.,  2007; 
Lin  et al.,  2007).  Since  then,  a  number  of  researchers 
have  examined  the  relationship  between  DRD2  poly-
morphisms  and  personality  traits,  with  mixed  results.

Other Genes of Interest

Other  genes  implicated  in  personality  development  in-
clude  the  MAOA  enzyme  (Soliman et al.,  2011;  Urata et 
al.,  2007),  GABRA6  (Alfimova et al.,  2010),  BDNF  (Suzu-

Personality  Genetic  Study    47

ki  et al.,  2011;  Terracciano  et al.,  2010a),  and  COMT 
(Tochigi  et al.,  2006;  Urata  et al.,  2007).  Unfortunately, 
negative  reports  are  ubiquitous  (Jorm  et al.,  2000;  Lee 
et al.,  2008).

Genome-wide  Linkage  Study

The  first  genome-wide  scan  for  personality  was  carried 
out  by  Cloninger  et al.  (1998).  A  total  of  758  sib  pairs 
from  177  nuclear  families  of  alcoholics  were  tested  us-
ing  the  TPQ.  The  significant  linkage  was  observed  be-
tween  Harm  Avoidance  and  a  region  on  chromosome 
8p21-23,  explaining  a  considerable  fraction  of  the  trait 
variance.  The  significant  evidence  of  epistasis  was  also 
observed  with  loci  on  18p,  20p,  and  21q,  and  oligogenic 
interactions  explained  most  of  the  variance  in  this  per-
sonality  trait.  The  linkage  of  Harm  Avoidance  to  8p21 
was  replicated  in  an  independent  sample  (Zohar  et al., 
2003). 
　The  genome-wide  scan  by  Fullerton et al.  (Fullerton et 
al.,  2003),  which  used  an  extremely  concordant-dis-
cordant  sibling  design,  screened  a  large  UK  population 
for  subjects  at  the  phenotypic  extreme  of  the  EPQ-R 
Neuroticism  scale.  Linkage  was  observed  on  1q,  4q,  7p, 
12q,  and  13q,  which  met  or  exceeded  the  5%  ge-
nome-wide  significance.  Weaker  evidence  for  linkage  on 
8p  and  on  11q  was  reported,  but  this  is  of  considerable 
interest,  since  8p  and  11q  overlap  with  regions  reported 
in  the  Cloninger  study. 
　In  Dutch  and  Australian  populations,  extremely  con-
cordant  and  discordant  sibbling  and  twin  pairs  were 
tested  for  genome-wide  linkage  for  several  personality 
traits  (Boomsma et al.,  2000;  Kirk et al.,  2000).  Recently, 
Gillespie  et  al.  (Gillespie  et al.,  2008)  reported  the  ge-
nome-wide  scan  for  Eysenck  Personality  Dimensions  in 
adolescent  twin  sibships.  The  highest  linkage  peaks 
were  found  on  chromosomes  16  and  19  for  Neuroticism; 
on  chromosomes  1,  7,  10,  13  m,  and  18  for  Psychoti-
cism;  and  on  chromosomes  2  and  3  for  Extraversion. 

Genome-wide  Association  Study  (GWAS)

The  genome-wide  association  studies  have  already 
scored  successes  in  several  illnesses,  such  as  type  2 
diabetes  (Frayling,  2007),  and  quantitative  traits,  such  as 
height  (Visscher,  2008).  An  early  genome-wide  associa-
tion  study  of  neuroticism  (based  on  pools  of  DNA  with 
high  and  low  Neuroticism  scores  rather  than  on  in-
dividuals)  found  nothing  that  was  consistently  replicable 
(Shifman  et al.,  2008).  The  authors  concluded  that  the 
heritability  of  neuroticism  probably  arises  from  many  lo-
ci,  each  explaining  much  less  than  1%  of  the  pheno-
typic  variation.  No  significant  SNPs  were  identified  un-

included  other 

der  linkage  peaks  derived  from  sib  pairs  in  the  same 
cohort  (Fullerton et al.,  2003;  Martin et al.,  2000).  They 
reported  an  association  in  the  PDE4D,  but  the  result 
was  not  genome-wide  significant.  Recently,  Calboli et al. 
performed  a  GWAS  for  EPQ  Neuroticism,  but  they  could 
not  find  common  SNP  variations  strongly  influencing 
neuroticism  (Calboli  et al.,  2010).
    Gene-finding  studies  for  personality,  including  ge-
nome-wide  linkage  and  association  studies,  have  largely 
focused  on  Neuroticism  (Calboli et al.,  2010;  Gillespie et 
al.,  2008;  Hettema  et al.,  2009;  Kuo  et  al.,  2007; 
Shifman et al.,  2008;  van  den  Oord et al.,  2008).  A  few 
studies  have  also 
traits,  such  as 
Extraversion  (Gillespie  et al.,  2008;  Terracciano  et al., 
2010b).
    So  far,  only  two  GWASs  of  a  personality  trait  and  a 
meta-analysis  of  GWAS  data  have  been  published  (de 
Moor et al.,  2011;  Terracciano et al.,  2010b;  Verweij et 
al.,  2010).  Terracciano  et al.  (2010b)  reported  the  first 
GWA  results  of  about  4000  individuals  for  all  five  di-
mensions  of  personality,  as  measured  by  NEO-PI-R.  The 
association  of  Neuroticism  with  SNAP25,  Extraversion 
with  BDNF  and  two  cadherin  genes  (CDH13  and 
CDH23),  Openness  with  CNTNAP2,  Agreeableness  with 
CLOCK,  and  Conscientiousness  with  DYRK1A  was 
shown,  but  the  effect  sizes  were  small,  and  most  of  the 
associations 
follow-up 
samples.  The  back-to  back  publication  of  the  GWAS  of 
Cloninger’s  temperament  scales  was  reported  (Verweij 
et al.,  2010).  They  identified  no  genetic  variants  that 
contributed  significantly  to  personality  variation.
    Recently,  only  one  meta-analysis  of  GWA  data  for 
personality  was  carried  out  in  10  discovery  samples 
(17,375  adults)  (de  Moor et al.,  2011).  Personality  scores 
were  based  on  the  NEO-PI.  The  results  showed  ge-
nome-wide  significance  for  Openness  to  Experience 
near  the  RASA1  gene  on  5q14.3  and  for  Conscientious-
ness  in  the  brain-expressed  KATNAL2  gene  on  18q21.1. 
However,  in  silico  replication  did  not  show  a  significant 
association  of  the  top  SNPs  with  personality  scores.

Conclusions  and  Future  Directions

With  respect  to  the  previously  discussed  association 
studies  in  the  personality  genetic  study,  there  are  sev-
eral  limitations.  One  of  them  is  a  lack  of  uniformity  in 
modeling  and  measuring  the  personality  phenotype.  It  is 
necessary  to  develop  a  uniform  phenotype  using  major 
personality  inventories  and  a  large  sample  size.  The 
abundant  failures  to  replicate  results  of  association 
studies  suggest  that  the  effects  of  candidate  genes 
(SERT,  DRD4,  and  so  on)  on  personality  traits  must  be 
small.  Other  as  yet  unknown  genes  may  exert  a  greater 

effect  on  the  personality  traits.
　As  mentioned  above,  there  are  no  clear,  replicable 
findings  to  date  in  GWASs  on  personality  traits.  In  their 
studies,  the  environmental  variables  were  not  consid-
ered,  and  the  age  range  of  subjects  was  broad,  which 
may  be  the  reasons  for  the  negative  results.  The  twin 
studies  consistently  show  that  the  environment  explains 
about  50%  of  the  variance.  In  the  case  of  personality, 
the  researchers  should  take  the  importance  of  the  envi-
ronment  for  the  personality  trait  into  account.  The  age 
range  of  subjects  should  be  narrowed  down,  because 
its  broad  range  might  conceal  a  true  association.
　The  other  variants,  including  copy  number  variation 
and  rare  variants  that  are  currently  not  captured  in 
searching  for  common  variants,  may  play  a  role  in  ex-
plaining  variation  in  personality.  In  future  work,  next- 
generation  sequencing  may  show  more  genetic  variants 
that  account  for  the  heritability  of  complex  traits,  includ-
ing  personality.  It  is  expected  that  knowledge  of  the  bi-
ological  mechanisms  in  normal  personality  can  contrib-
ute  to  our  understanding  of  personality  disorder.  On  the 
other  hand,  by  searching  for  “personality  genes,”  we 
want  to  identify  candidate  genes  for  psychiatric  disor-
ders.
