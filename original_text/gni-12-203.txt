Hepatitis is a common and serious disease for the Korean population. It is caused by a virus, the A and B types of which are 
plentiful in Koreans. In this study, we tried to find genetic factors for hepatitis through genome-wide association studies. We 
took 368 cases and 1,500 controls from Anseong and Ansan cohort data. About 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
and 20 epidemiological variables were analyzed. We did not find any meaningful significant single nucleotide polymor-
phisms, but we confirmed the influence of major epidemiological variables on hepatitis.

Keywords: cohort analysis, genome-wide association study, hepatitis

Introduction

Hepatitis  is  inflammation  of the  liver, most  commonly 
caused by a viral infection [1]. Five main hepatitis viruses are 
known,  referred  to  as  types  A,  B,  C,  D,  and  E.  We  are 
concerned with these main types because of the burden of 
illness and death; they also have the potential for outbreaks 
and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to 
chronic  disease  in  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  and 
together constitute the most common cause of liver cirrhosis 
and cancer [1]. The Korean Health Insurance Review and 
Assessment Service [2] reported on C type hepatitis patients 
in Korea, described in Table 1. Table 1 shows that the number 
of patients has been increased steadily. The prevalence rate 
of  hepatitis  type  C  in  Koreans  is  1%–1.5%.  From  the 
prevalence  rate,  500,000–600,000  patients  are  estimated. 
Only 10% of them are treated. If we find risk factors for 
hepatitis, it is helpful for the prevention and treatment of 
hepatitis.

In this study, we performed a genome-wide association 
study of hepatitis in Korean populations. We tried to find 
significant  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and 
epidemiological traits related to hepatitis.

Methods
Phenotype and genotype data

The study subjects are based on the Anseong and Ansan 
cohort data, part of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) 
projects.  The  genotypes  and  phenotypes  of  the  cohort 
population  are  described  in  Cho  et  al.  [3].  Subjects  with 
genotype accuracies below 98%, high missing genotype call 
rates (≥4%), high heterozygosity (＞30%), or inconsistency 
in sex were excluded from subsequent analyses. Individuals 
who had a tumor were excluded, as were related individuals 
whose estimated identity-by-state values were high (＞0.80). 
After these quality control steps, 352,000 SNP genotypes for 
8,842  individuals  were  selected  [4].  The  epidemiological 
trait data for these individuals were also from the KARE 
project. Among the total of 8,842 individual cases, 368 had 
hepatitis with age over 30, and 1,500 controls were randomly 
selected from non-hepatitis  individuals with age over 30. 
Table  2  summarizes  the  clinical  characteristics  of  the 
phenotypes in this study.

The chosen dataset was imbalanced; the number of cases 
was  smaller  than  controls.  A  dataset  is  imbalanced  if  it 
contains many more samples from one class than from the 
rest of the classes [5]. In this case, the classification analysis

showed good accuracy in the majority class but very poor 
accuracy  in  the  minority  class.  Therefore,  we  needed  to 
transform the imbalanced dataset to a balanced dataset. We 
applied  an  ‘oversampling’  scheme  [5]  to  overcome  the 
imbalance  problem.  The  final  dataset  contained  1,500 
controls and 1,500 cases.

To find significant SNPs, we used PLINK, version 1.07 [6].

Epidemiological studies

Using  the  traits  in  Table  2,  we  performed  a  logistic 
regression test. Table 5 summarizes the results. As we can 
see, diabetes, gastritis, allergy, external head injury, taking 
arthritis drug, and degree of albumin were highly correlated 
with hepatitis. In the case of diabetes, the probability that a 
diabetes  patient  had  hepatitis  was  4  times  higher  than  a 
diabetes-free person. In general, the hepatitis C virus is often 
associated  with  diabetes,  and  some  diabetics  may  even 
develop  chronic  hepatitis  [7].  Gastritis  is  influenced  by 
hepatitis.  If  we  have  hepatitis,  the  probability  of  getting 
gastritis is increased 1.5 times. Especially, chronic gastritis 
develops by chronic hepatitis [8]. Sometimes, allergy causes 

Other statistical analyses were performed using R, version 
3.1. We used logistic regression to find major factors related 
with hepatitis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)/area 
under the curve (AUC) analysis was performed to confirm 
the prediction power of the major factors that were found.

Results
Genome-wide association studies

Table  3  summarizes  20  SNPs  that  were  top-ranked  by 
p-value  in  the  genome-wide  association  analysis.  Unfor-
tunately, there were no significant SNPs that met p ＜ 5 × 
–8.  We  performed  logistic  regression  test  on  the 
10
top-ranked SNPs, and we took 10 SNPs in Table 4. Logistic 
regression measures the relationship between a categorical 
dependent  variable  (phenotype)  and  one  or  more  indep-
endent variables (SNPs). Fig. 1 shows the ROC plot for the 
classification test using the 10 SNPs. The AUC value from 
the ROC plot is 0.700; it is not enough as a biomarker.

stand the relationship among diseases more clearly. Current 
known  disease  networks  [10,  11]  do  not  show  detailed 
relationships between hepatitis and other diseases. This is a 
future research topic.

KARE data are the result of a cohort study. It contains a 
small number of samples for specific diseases, whereas the 
whole  population  is  very  big.  It  induces  an  imbalanced 
dataset  for  statistical  analysis.  Our  study  implies  a  basic 
limitation,  even  though  we  tried  to  complement  the 
problem. We also did not find any significant SNPs related 
with  hepatitis.  If  we  combine  the  knowledge  of  other 
biological databases, we may get a more meaningful inter-
pretation for the results of our experiment.

hepatitis.  It  increases  the  probability  of  hepatitis  by  1.8 
times. Hepatitis virus can cause arthritis [9]; it increases the 
probability of arthritis by 1.9 times. The degree of albumin is 
inversely proportional to hepatitis (odds ratio [OR], 0.8), 
because the liver makes albumin, and hepatitis enervates the 
process. The OR between external head injury and hepatitis 
is  very  high  (OR,  1.31).  We  cannot  explain  the  medical 
relationship between them. It needs more analysis.

Table 6 shows AUC values from the variables in Table 5. As 
we can see, four variables can explain 64.7% of the cause of 
hepatitis, and 8 variables can explain 69.3%. Fig. 2 shows the 
ROC plot for eight variables in Table 3.

Discussion

From  the  epidemiological  analysis,  we  found  relevant 
variables with hepatitis. We confirmed that hepatitis has a 
wide  relation  with  other  diseases.  If  we  make  a  disease
