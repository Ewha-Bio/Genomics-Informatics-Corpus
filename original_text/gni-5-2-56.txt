Abstract
Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) 
is a common craniofacial birth defect that is the result of a 
mixture of genetic and environmental factors. While studies 
have identified a number of different candidate genes and 
loci for the etiology of CL/P, the results have not been 
consistent  among  different  ethnic  groups.  To  study  the 
genetic  association  of  the  candidate  genes  in  Korean 
patients affected by CL/P, we genotyped 97 nonsyndromic 
CL/P  patients  and  100  control  individuals  using  single 
nucleotide polymorphic markers at the MTHFR, TGFA, and 
IRF6 genes. We report that the T3827C marker at TGFA 
showed significant association with nonsyndromic CL/P, but 
all the other markers tested were not significantly associated 
with nonsyndromic CL/P in Korean patients.

Introduction
Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is the most common 
craniofacial birth defect with an average prevalence of 1 in 
500 to 1 in 2,500 births (Tolarova et al., 1998). The incidence 
of CL/P significantly varies with different ethnic groups, 
geographic locations and socioeconomic status. African 
Americans exhibit the lowest prevalence of 0.3 in 1,000 
births, followed by Caucasians with prevalence of 1 in 1000 
births (Wyszynski et al., 1996). In contrast, Asians and Native

Americans show the highest prevalence of 2.1 and 3.6 in 
1,000 births, respectively (Wyszynski et al., 1996). CL/P is 
epidemiologically and etiologically distinct from isolated cleft 
palate  (CP)  which  shows  an  ethnic  heterogeneity  of 
incidence that is distinct from CL/P (Jones, 1993). Orofacial 
clefting also occurs as a characteristic clinical feature in 
syndromic cases, such as Van der Woude syndrome, cleft 
palate with ankyloglossia, and Treacher-Collins syndrome 
(Stainier et al., 2004). However, most cases of orofacial 
clefting are nonsyndromic, showing no association with other 
structural abnormalities.

Nonsyndromic CL/P is a genetically and developmentally 
complex  disorder,  with  a  mutifactorial  etiology  that 
encompasses genetic and environmental components. 
Palatal developmental is an elaborately controlled process 
involving a number of different factors including growth 
factors, transcription factors, receptors, cell adhesion proteins, 
extracellular matrix proteins, and matrix metalloproteinases 
(Stainier et al., 2004). A number of genes, including TGFA 
(transforming growth factor alpha), TGFB2 (transforming 
growth factor beta 2), TGFB3 (transforming growth factor 
beta 3), IRF6 (interferon regulatory factor 6), MSX1 (muscle 
segment homeobox Drosophila homolog 1), and MTHFR 
(methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), have been reported 
in association studies with nonsyndromic CL/P (Cobourne, 
2004; Jugessur et al., 2005). The epigenetic influence of 
environmental factors such as folate deficiency, steroid and 
statin  use,  retinoid  exposure,  maternal  smoking,  and 
maternal alcohol use are also associated with the incidence 
of CL/P (Cobourne, 2004; Jugessur et al., 2005).

In an attempt to re-examine association of MTHFR, TGFA, 
and IRF6 with nonsyndromic CL/P in Korean patients, we 
genotyped  97  nonsyndromic  CL/P  patients  with  the 
MTHFR-C677T, TGFA-C3296T, TGFA-T3827C and IRF6-G820A 
markers. In these studies, TGFA-T3827C showed significant 
association with nonsyndromic CL/P, but the other markers 
were not significantly associated with nonsyndromic CL/P in 
Korean patients.

Materials and Methods
Patients and DNA samples
The study group consisted of 97 Korean patients with 

nonsyndromic CL/P and 100 non-related healthy individuals. 
The  CL/P  phenotype  spectrum  included  unilateral  or 
bilateral cleft lip with or without cleft palate. Some of the 
patients also showed bifid uvula. After informed consent 
was obtained from patients and control individuals, blood 
samples were taken to be used in the study. Genomic DNA 
samples of the participating individuals were extracted 
from whole blood using a Puregene DNA Isolation Kit 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Gentra Systems).

Genotype analysis
The  genomic  regions  encompassing  MTHFR-C677T, 
TGFA-C3296T, TGFA-T3827C, and IRF6-G820A were 
PCR-amplified using primers derived from the flanking 
sequences of each marker. The sequences of the primers 
are listed in Table 1. Thermocycling was performed using 
Taq polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. For restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) analysis of MTHFR-C677T, TGFA-C3296T, and 
IRF6-G820A,  the  PCR-amplicons  were  digested  with 
HinfI, DraI, or DpnII, respectively. After digestion with the 
appropriate restriction enzyme, the DNA fragments were 
analyzed  by  electrophoresis  in  10%  non-denaturing 
polyacrylamide gels or 2.5% agarose gels. For the analysis 
of TGFA-T3827C which does not have an informative 
restriction site, genotyping was performed by sequencing 
the PCR-amplified fragments using the Cycle Sequencing 
Ready  Reaction  Kit  (Applied  Biosystems).  Sequence 
scanning  was  carried  out  using  an  ABI  3100  genetic 
analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Allele frequencies in CL/P 
patients and controls were determined by counting alleles 
and calculating sample proportions. The Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium was evaluated for all markers. Fisher’s exact 
probability test was utilized to assess P and χ2 values. 
P-values  less  than  0.05  were  considered  to  indicate 
statistical significance.

IRF6-G820A  were  determined  by  RFLP  analysis.  A 
nucleotide change from C to T at position 667 of MTHFR 
creates a HinfI restriction site resulting in fragments of 175 
bp and 71 bp following HinfI digestion of the 246 bp DNA. 
The 246 bp fragment represents the C allele while the 175 
bp fragment represents the T allele (Fig. 1A). Similarly, a 
C to T change at TGFα-C3296T creates a DraI restriction 
site that leads to digestion of the 98 bp fragments into 70 
bp  and  28  bp  fragments  (Fig.  1B).  In  the  case  of 
IRF6-G820A, a G to A change introduces a DpnII restriction 
site leading to digestion of the 298 bp fragments into 234 
bp  and  64  bp  fragments  (Fig.  1C).  Genotypes  at 
TGFA-T3827C  were  assessed  by  DNA  sequencing 
analysis of the PCR-amplified fragments.

Genotype frequencies of MTHFR-C677T, TGFA-C3296T, 
TGFA-T3827C, and IRF6-G820A in CL/P patients and 
normal controls are summarized in Table 2. At MTHFR-C677T, 
TGFA-C3296T, and IRF6-G820A, there were no statistically 
significant differences in the genotype frequencies between 
CL/P  patients  and  controls.  In  contrast,  the  genotype 
frequencies of TGFA-T3827C were significantly different 
between the patient and control groups with a P-value of 
0.004 (Table. 2), indicating that the TT polymorphism is 
significantly associated with CL/P in the patient group 
tested.  However,  there  was  no  statistically  significant

Discussion
MTHFR plays a key role in the metabolism of folate. The 
C677T change in MTHFR leads to the substitution of a 
highly conserved alanine residue into a valine residue in 
the catalytic domain of MTHFR. The reduced MTHFR 
activity resulting from the C677T mutation leads to an 
increase in the plasma homocysteine level and a decrease 
in the plasma folate level (Blom, 1998). Given that the intake 
of folate reduces the probability of women giving birth to 
a child affected by a neural tube defect (NTD), this enzyme 
was suggested as an attractive candidate for the etiology 

of CL/P (MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991). 
Genotype analysis of several different ethnic groups has 
revealed higher frequencies of 677TT homozygosity in 
NTD patients than in controls (de Franchis et al. 1995; Kirke 
et al., 1996; Mills et al., 1995). However, some studies have 
not shown a significant association between the C667T 
allele and NTD in different ethnicities (Koch et al., 1998; 
Mornet et al., 1997; Papapetrou et al., 1996). In concurrence 
with previous studies, the study presented here did not 
show a statistically significant association between MTHFR- 
C677T  and  CL/P.  We  detected  approximately  similar 
frequencies of 677TT homozygosity in both CL/P and 
control groups.

Van der Woude syndrome (VWS; OMIM 119300) is an 
autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital 
lip  pits  with  CL/P.  VWS  is  the  most  common  form  of 
syndromic cleft lip and palate, accounting for approximately 
2 % of all cleft lip and palate cases. It is distinguished from 
nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate by the presence of lower 
lip pits (Burdick et al., 1985). By direct sequence analysis 
of the genomic VWS region of a pair of monozygotic twins 
discordant for the VWS phenotype, IRF6 was identified as 
the gene mutated in this orofacial malformation, suggesting 
a possibility that IRF6 may also play a role in nonsyndromic 
CL/P (Kondo et al., 2002). Recently, several studies have 
reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism, G820A in 
IRF6, is associated with CL/P in several different ethnic 
groups (Scapoli et al., 2005; Zucchero et al., 2004). The 
G820A polymorphism results in a substitution from valine 
to isoleucine at codon 274, which is located in a putative 
Smad-interferon regulatory factor-binding domain of IRF6. 
The Smad proteins are a family of transcription factors 
known to transduce signals from the TGF-β superfamily 
(Brivanlou et al., 2002). However, in our study the G820A 
was not significantly associated with nonsyndromic CL/P, 
but the A allele was less frequently found in CL/P than in 
controls. These contradictory results may reflect genetic 
heterogeneity, incomplete penetrance, or limited sample 
sizes.

During  craniofacial  development,  TGFα,  a  well 
characterized mammalian growth factor, is expressed in 
the medial edge of the epithelium of fusing palatal shelves, 
and  promotes  synthesis  of  extracellular  matrix  and 
mesenchymal cell migration into the palates (Dixon et al., 
1991).  A  number  of  studies  have  reported  genotype 
analysis of CL/P patients with genetic markers in TGFA 
since the first finding that polymorphisms in TGFA were 
associated with nonsyndromic CL/P (Ardinger et al., 1989). 
In the genotyping studies presented here, TGFA-T3827C 
showed a statistically significant association with CL/P, 
with a higher frequency of the TT genotype in CL/P patients 
than in controls, while TGFA-C3296T displayed no statistical 

significance in its association with CL/P. Several previous 
studies also reported the association of TGFA-C3827T 
with nonsyndromic CL/P in different ethnic backgrounds 
including Caucasians and Filipinos (Prescott et al, 2000; 
Schultz et al., 2004).

In summary, our genotype analyses show a significant 
association of TGFA-T3827C with nonsyndromic CL/P. 
However, TGFA-C3296T, MTHFR-C677T and IRF6-G820A 
showed no statistical significance in their association with 
CL/P. These contradictory results are probably due to 
genetic  heterogeneity,  incomplete  penetrance,  limited 
sample sizes and different study designs. A meta-analysis 
in a wider range of patient groups with more complete 
clinical descriptions of affected individuals may be required 
to more completely characterize the association between 
genetic markers and nonsyndromic CL/P.
