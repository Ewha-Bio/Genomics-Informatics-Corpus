Abstract

Genome-wise  association  studies  (GWASs)  have  be-
come  popular  approaches  to  identify  genetic  variants 
associated  with  human  biological  traits.  In  this  study,  we 
applied  Structural  Equation  Models  (SEMs)  in  order  to 
model  complex  relationships  between  genetic  networks 
and  traits  as  risk  factors.  SEMs  allow  us  to  achieve  a 
better  understanding  of  biological  mechanisms  through 
identifying  greater  numbers  of  genes  and  pathways  that 
are  associated  with  a  set  of  traits  and  the  relationship 
among  them.  For  efficient  SEM  analysis  for  GWASs,  we 
developed  a  procedure,  comprised  of  four  stages.  In  the 
first  stage,  we  conducted  single-SNP  analysis  using  re-
gression  models,  where  age,  sex,  and  recruited  area 
were  included  as  adjusting  covariates.  In  the  second 
stage,  Fisher’s  combination  test  was  conducted  for 
each  gene  to  detect  significant  genes  using  p-values 
obtained  from  the  single-SNP  analysis.  In  the  third 
stage,  Fisher’s  exact  test  was  adopted  to  determine 
which  biological  pathways  were  enriched  with  significant 
SNPs.  Finally,  based  on  a  pathway  that  was  associated 
with  the  four  traits  in  common,  a  SEM  was  fit  to  model 
a  causal  relationship  among  the  genetic  factors  and 
traits.  We  applied  our  SEM  model  to  GWAS  data  with 
four  central  obesity  related  traits:  suprailiac  and  sub-
scapular  measures 
fat,  BMI,  and 
hypertension.  Study  subjects  were  collected  from  two 
Korean  cohort  regions.  After  quality  control,  327,872 
SNPs  for  8842  individuals  were  included  in  the  analysis. 
After  comparing  two  SEMs,  we  concluded  that  supra-
iliac  and  subscapular  measures  may  indirectly  affect  hy-
pertension  susceptibility  by  influencing  BMI.  In  con-
clusion,  our  analysis  demonstrates  that  SEMs  provide  a 
better  understanding  of  biological  mechanisms  by  identi-
fying  greater  numbers  of  genes  and  pathways.

Introduction

Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  are  one  of 
the  major  tools  used  to  detect  disease  susceptibility 
loci.  They  have  been  successful  in  identifying  associa-
tions  of  hundreds  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphism 
(SNPs)  with  complex  traits  (Rioux  et al.,  2007;  Saxena 
et  al.,  2007;  WTCCC,  2007;  Zanke  et  al.,  2007). 
However,  testing  only  for  the  association  of  individual 
SNPs  has  limitations  in  unveiling  the  complex  mecha-
nism  of  genetic  structures  for  complex  traits  (Lesnick et 
al.,  2007).  Dissecting  biological  phenomena  and  under-
standing  the  structure  of  the  complex  components  com-
prising  a  biological  pathway  are  challenging  tasks. 
Commonly,  GWASs  have  reported  several  significant 
SNPs  from  individual  SNP  analyses.  However,  complex 
traits  are  affected  by  the  joint  action  of  various  genes. 
If  only  the  significant  SNPs  from  the  individual  SNP 
analysis  are  considered,  the  genetic  variants  that  have 
joint  action  in  determining  traits  with  small  individual 
contributions  will  be  neglected. 
    Furthermore,  the  functions  of  SNPs  are  not  well  con-
ceived  in  many  cases,  but  the  functions  of  genes  and 
pathways  have  been  better  explored.  Therefore,  gene- 
and  pathway-based  analysis  provides  an  easier  inter-
pretation  to  unravel  the  mechanisms  of  complex  traits 
(Baranzini  et al.,  2009;  Kraft  and  Raychaudhuri,  2009; 
Rajagopalan  and  Agarwal,  2005).  Most  complex  traits 
arise  from  complex  interactions  among  multiple  genetic 
factors  and  environmental  factors. 
    In  this  study,  we  applied  Structural  Equation  Models 
(SEMs)  in  order  to  model  complex  relationships  between 
genetic  networks  and  traits  as  risk  factors  (Bollen, 
1989).  The  SEM  was  originally  developed  in  the  field  of 
social  science  to  fit  a  model  with  unobserved  variables. 
It  is  well  known  that  the  main  advantage  of  the  SEM 
approach  is  that  it  allows  us  to  compare  several  candi-
date  models.  Our  application  of  the  SEM  to  a  GWAS 
enables  us  to  investigate  how  each  risk  factor  affects  a 
targeted  trait  directly  or  through  other  variables,  and 
SEM  is  used  to  represent  the  relationship  among  multi-
ple  phenotypes.  In  order  to  choose  the  components 

used  to  build  a  model,  it  is  desirable  to  consider  a  high-
er  level  of  genetic  components,  such  as  gene  and  bio-
logical  pathways. 
    However,  due  to  the  enormous  number  of  SNPs  in  a 
GWAS,  it  is  practically  difficult  to  apply  SEMs  to  GWAS 
data.  Thus,  some  step-wise  procedure  for  filtering  out 
SNPs  is  required  in  order  to  reduce  the  burden  of 
computation.  Our  proposed  procedure  comprises  four 
stages.  At  the  first  stage,  single  SNP  association  tests 
are  conducted.  The  next  step  is  to  combine  P-values  for 
correlated  SNPs  in  order  to  represent  a  gene  by  using 
Fisher’s  combination  test  (Zaykin  et al.,  2007).  Next, 
Fisher’s  exact  test  is  employed  to  find  the  association 
of  a  pathway  related  with  the  traits.  Finally,  SEMs  are 
used  to  model  how  each  risk  factor  influences  the  trait 
of  interest  based  on  the  pathway  chosen  from  the  pre-
vious  stages. 
    The proposed SEM approach is applied to a large-scale 
GWA  dataset  (i.e.,  8842  samples  and  327,872  SNPs), 
obtained  from  a  Korean  population.  Especially,  our  anal-
ysis  focuses  on  identifying  the  relationship  between  hy-
pertension,  obesity,  and  genetic  variants.  In  hyperten-
sion,  it  is  known  that  greater  fatness  or  obesity  in  the 
extreme  is  associated  with  greater  blood  pressure  or 
hypertension  in  the  extreme  (Dustan,  1991).  Understan-
ding  the  connections  between  hypertension  and  relative 
obesity  is  an  important  step  in  understanding  the  bio-
logical  mechanism  between  them  and  providing  useful 
information  for  the  potential  treatment.  Central  body  fat 
distribution  is  especially  associated  with  hypertension 
and  insulin  resistance  (Licata et al.,  1994;  Scaglione et 
al.,  1995).  In  this  study,  we  investigated  the  genetic 
components  associated  with  four  central  obesity-related 
traits  by  conducting  the  proposed  four-stage  analysis 
for  large-scale  GWAS  data.  Our  GWAS  data  were  col-
lected  from  the  participants  of  two  cohort  regions  in 
Korea.  The  four  traits  used  for  analyses  were  suprailiac, 
subscapular,  BMI,  and  hypertension.  BMI  is  used  for 
whole-body  obesity,  and  suprailiac  and  subscapular 
represent  upper  central  body  fatness.

Methods

Study  subjects

The  data  were  collected  from  a  Korea  Association 
Resource  (KARE)  project  that  was  initiated  in  2007  to 
undertake  a  large-scale  GWA  analysis.  The  10,038  par-
ticipants  were  recruited  from  two  community-based  co-
horts:  Ansung,  representing  mainly  a  rural  community, 
and  Ansan,  representing  an  urban  community--5018 
from  Ansung  and  5,020  from  Ansan,  aged  between  40 
and  69  years  old  (Cho,  et al.,  2009)  (Table  1).  A  total 

GWAS  Using  Structural  Equation  Models      151

of  8800  participants  (4162  men  and  4638  women)  were 
included  for  the  GWAS  analysis,  excluding  those  who 
were  taking  medicine  or  therapy  for  lipoprotein  levels.

Genotyping  and  quality  control

The  DNA  samples  were  isolated  from  the  peripheral 
blood  of  participants  and  genotyped  using  the  Affymet-
rix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0.  The  Bayesian 
Robust  Linear  Modeling  using  Mahalanobis  Distance 
(BRLMM)  was  used  for  genotype  calling.  Standard  data 
quality  control  procedures  were  applied  for  the  subjects 
and  SNPs,  as  described  in  Cho et al.  (2009).  After  con-
sideration  of  the  sample  and  SNP  quality  controls,  a  to-
tal  of  8842  participants  and  352,228  SNPs  remained  for 
the  subsequent  analysis. 

Obesity-related  traits

In  this  study,  four  traits  were  considered:  subscapular, 
suprailiac,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  and  hypertension. 
Subscapular  and  suprailiac  values  are  skinfold  thickness 
measurements  for  upper  central  body  fat  distribution 
around  the  waist.  The  subscapular  measure  is  a  vertical 
fold  taken  one  inch  to  the  side  of  the  umbilicus  from  the 
abdominal.  The  suprailiac  measure  is  a  diagonal  fold 
taken  midway  between  the  hip  joint  and  the  bottom  of 
the  rib  cage.  BMI  is  defined  as  the  individual's  body 
weight  divided  by  the  square  of  his  or  her  height. 
Hypertensive  status  was  defined  as  a  SBP  ＜140  mm 
Hg  and/or  DBP  ＜90  mm  Hg,  and  the  blood  pressure 
was  measured  in  the  supine  position.  One  of  the 
well-known  risk  factors  of  cardiovascular  diseases  is 
obesity.  Especially,  multiple  studies  have  reported  that 
abdominal  obesity  is  a  better  predictor  of  hypertension 
rather  than  whole  body  fat  mass  (Niskanen et al.,  2004; 
Selby  et al.,  1989).

ducted  for  individual  phenotypes  independently  using 
three  linear  regression  models  for  quantitative  traits  and 
a  logistic  regression  model  for  hypertension.  Age,  sex, 
and  recruited  area  (Ansan  or  Ansung)  were  included  as 
adjusting  covariates  in  all  of  the  regression  models.  An 
additive  allelic  effect  was  assumed  for  the  mode  of  ge-
netic  inheritance.  Association  analyses  were  conducted 
using  PLINK  software  (Purcell  et al.,  2007). 
    Next,  gene-based  association  tests  were  conducted 
using  Fisher's  combination  test  on  the  set  of  p-values 
obtained  from  the  SNPs  within  a  gene.  The  statistic  (ZF) 
for K  p-values  obtained  from K  SNPs  in  a  gene  is  given

    Thirdly,  Fisher's  exact  test,  based  on  the  hyper-
genometric  distribution,  was  employed  to  search  for  bio-
logical  pathways  that  were  enriched  in  the  significantly 
associated  genes.  Let N  be  the  total  number  of  genes 
that  are  of  interest;  S  be  the  number  of  genes  that  are

resent  the  genes  in  the  pathway  and  significantly  asso-
ciated  genes  in  the  pathway,  respectively.  The  sig-

Combinatorial  analysis  using  SEMs 

SEMs  are  comprehensive  statistical  models  that  allow 
us  to  test  relations  among  observed  and  latent  (not  ob-
served  directly)  variables.  The  SEMs  for  our  genetic  net-
works  were  defined  as  follows:

    y  =  Λyη+ε,

  η =  Bη+ç,

    where y  is  a  vector  representing  the  observed  varia-
bles;  η is  a  vector  of  the  latent  variables  (pathway);  Λy 
is  a  matrix  representing  the  true  relationships  between 
the  SNP  and  pathway;  and  B  is  a  matrix  representing 
the 
latent  variables. 
Random  errors  in  the  equations  are  represented  by  ε 

and ç.  To  fit  this  model,  we  used  AMOS,  a  SEM  soft-

Results

Single-SNP  analysis  using  regression  models 

Of  10,038  participants  recruited  from  two  Korean  cohort 
areas,  8800  individuals  were  included  to  analyze  the  as-
sociation  between  genetic  variants  and  four  central  obe-
sity-related  traits:  suprailiac,  subscapular,  BMI,  and 
hypertension.  The  association  between  each  of  the 
327,872  SNPs  and  each  trait  was  evaluated  via  a  re-
gression  model,  adjusted  for  gender,  age,  and  recruit-
ment  area.  We  used  a  significance  level  corresponding 
to  p-value＜1.0e-5  to  determine  which  SNPs  were  asso-
ciated  with  a  trait.  The  detailed  results  are  in  Table  2. 
    For  suprailiac,  20  SNPs  resulted  in  a  significant 
association.  Of  these,  rs16906215  in  TLR4  showed  the 
strongest  association.  The  TLR4  gene  encodes  a  toll-like 
receptor  protein,  which  is  an  important  member  of  the 
innate  immune  response.  This  gene  has  been  reported 
to  be  associated  with  type  2  diabetes  (Kolz,  2008). 
However,  the  effect  of  a  SNP  located  far  downstream  of 
a  gene  is  hard  to  interpret. 
    For  subscapular,  5  SNPs  from  4  genes  met  the  sig-
nificance  criteria.  The  four  genes  are  GRIN2A,  NBPF21P, 
LOC1001131027,  and  FTO,  and  two  SNPs  from  FTO 
were  identified  to  be  significant.  FTO  is  one  of  the  pop-
ular  genes  that  are  associated  with  fat  mass  and 
obesity.  The  rs9939609  allele  in  the  FTO  gene  was  pre-
viously  reported  to  be  positively  related  with  BMI 
(Frayling et al.,  2007;  Willer et al.,  2009)  and  type  2  dia-
betes  (WTCCC,  2007).  Rs9939609  also  showed  a  mar-
ginally  significant  association  with  subscapular,  produc-
ing  a  p-value  of  1.14e-05  and  a  significant  association 
with  BMI  in  our  analysis.  The  most  significant  SNP  was 
located  upstream  of  the  NMDA  receptor  (GRIN2A)  gene, 
and  GRIN2A  was  reported  to  be  correlated  with  hyper-
tension  from  a  previous  GWAS  data  analysis  (Torkamani 
et al.,  2008). 
    In  the  analysis  of  hypertension,  four  significant  SNPs 
were  detected  from  three  genes:  ATP2B1,  CSK,  and 
PTPN11.  The  results  of  ATP2B1  and  CSK  reproduced 
the  significant  relationships  between  variants  of  the 
genes  and  hypertension  that  had  been  previously  re-
ported  by  Hong et al.,  (2010).  In  their  study,  they  con-
ducted  a  meta-analysis  using  two  cohort  studies  in 
Korea,  including  KARE  (Hong et al.,  2010).  ATP2B  was 
also  reported  to  be  associated  with  hypertension  in  an-
other  study  (Levy  et al.,  2009).  The  key  function  of 
ATP2B1  is  to  control  homeostasis  of  cellular  calcium  ion 
levels,  which  are  related  with  vascular  smooth  muscle 
contraction  and  dilation.

which  was  shown  for  the  subscapular  analysis,  were 
from  the  FTO  gene.  SEC16B  polymorphisms  were  pre-
viously  reported  to  be  associated  with  obesity  and  obe-
sity-induced  diabetes  (Hotta  et al.,  2009).

Gene-based  analysis  using  Fisher’s  combination 
test

Next,  we  tested  for  the  association  of  genes  using 
Fisher’s  combination  test,  where  a  set  of  p-values  for 
SNPs  in  a  gene  were  considered  simultaneously.  We 
mapped  the  identified  SNPs  to  exon/intron  or  within  the 
5-kbp  upstream/0.5-kbp  downstream  regions  of  the 
known  genes.  In  total,  31,207  genes  were  annotated 
among  327,872  SNPs.  The  P-values  of  the  genes  were 
calculated  by  Fisher’s  combination  test.  The  numbers  of 

154    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(3)  150-158,  September  2010

genes  that  were  significantly  associated  with  a  p-value 
less  than  1.0e-5  were  selected.  From  the  analysis,  we 
could  find  that  a  large  portion  of  significant  genes  con-
tained  insignificant  SNPs.  This  shows  that  joint  analysis 
of  multiple  loci  within  a  gene  can  have  more  power, 
when  a  single  SNP  does  not  have  a  strong  effect  on 
complex  diseases. 
    For  subscapular,  33  genes  were  found  to  be  asso-
ciated.  For  subscapular,  54  genes  were  detected. 
Sixty-nine  genes  showed  a  strong  association  with  BMI. 
Hypertension  had  75  genes  showing  a  strong  associa-
tion.  The  gene-based  approach  detected  more  genes  in 
common  within  the  four  phenotypes  than  the  sin-
gle-marker  association  analyses.  Three  genes,  SH3RF3, 
c12ORF51,  and  ATG10,  were  detected  to  be  shared 
with  hypertension  and  BMI.  BMI  and  suprailiac  shared 
13  genes,  BMI  and  suprailiac  had  8  genes  in  common. 
Thus,  subscapular  and  BMI  had  a  much  greater  number 
of  associated  genes  in  common  than  suprailiac  and 
BMI.  Subscapular  and  suprailiac  had  9  genes 
in 
common.  BMI,  subscapular,  and  suprailiac  had  PDIA6 
and  SNX9  in  common  (Table  3).  The  PDIA6  gene  enc-
odes  a  protein  disulfide  isomerase  family  member  pro-
tein  and  localizes  in  the  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER).  The 
role  of  this  gene,  related  to  obesity,  has  been  discussed 
in  the  aspect  of  one  of  the  adipocyte  extracellular  ma-
trix  (ECM)  processing  enzymes  (Mariman  and  Wang, 
2010),  which  partly  explains  the  association  between 
SNPs  in  PDIA6  and  obesity-related  traits  in  common.

and  Genomes  (KEGG;  www.genome.jp/kegg/),  BioCarta 
(www.biocarta.com/), and GenMAPP (http://www.genmapp.

for  each  phenotype,  identified  using  p-values  from 
Fisher’s  exact  test.  Eighteen  significant  pathways  were 
detected  for  BMI,  23  significant  pathways  for  hyper-
tension,  16  significant  pathways  for  suprailiac,  and  17 
significant  pathways  for  subscapular.  MAPK  signaling 
pathway  was  shown  to  be  common  for  all  of  the  four 
analyzed  traits.  Hypertension,  subscapular,  and  supra-
iliac  had  calcium  signaling  pathway  in  common. 
    MAPK  signaling  pathway  is  one  of  the  most  ubiquitous 
signal  transduction  systems.  The  role  of  JNK-MAPK  sig-
naling  in  obesity  was  reported  by  multiple  studies  (Bost 
et al.,  2005;  Hirosumi  et al.,  2002).  In  addition,  the 
MAPK  signaling  pathway  is  claimed  to  be  related  to  car-
diac  hypertrophy  through  the  Grb2  adapter  protein  and 
cardiac  p38  MAPK  signaling.  Human  cardiac  hyper-
trophy  is  a  common  condition  that  often  develops  as  a 
by-product  of  hypertension  or  valvular  heart  disease 
(Zhang  et al.,  2003). 
    The  calcium  signaling  pathwayis  a  well-known  target 
for  treatment  of  hypertension  (Berridge,  1994).  Recently, 
calcium  signaling  in  obesity  was  also  studied  and  re-
ported  to  have  a  role  in  determining  the  cell  fate  of  adi-
pocytes  (Sergeev,  2009).

SEM  Analysis

Pathway-based  analysis  using  Fisher’s  exact 
test

In  order  to  determine  the  biological  pathways  that  are 
associated  with  the  four  traits,  we  conducted  tests  on 
whether  a  pathway  was  enriched  with  the  significant 
genes  identified  from  the  gene-based  analysis.  Our 
pathway-based  analysis  was  conducted  using  465  path-

In  this  analysis,  SEMs  were  used  to  equate  causal  rela-
tionships  between  genetic  networks  and  correlated  phe-
notypes  based  on  the  analysis  results  in  the  previous 
stages.  We  constructed  SEMs,  including  the  MAPK  sig-
naling  pathway,  which  appears  to  be  significantly  com-
mon  for  every  phenotype.  SNPs  were  chosen  within 
genes  from  the  MAPK  signaling  pathwaywith  p-values 
less  than  1.0e-04  for  each  phenotype.  In  the  models,

having  P-values＜1.0E−5  from  Fisher’s  combination  test  were  considered  to  be  significant.  The  numbers  of  significant 

genes  were  55  for  subscapular  (SUB),  54  for  suprailiac  (SUP),  69  for  BMI,  and  75  for  hypertension  (HTN)

the  pathway  was  treated  as  a  latent  variable,  and  SNPs 
and  four  phenotypes  were  the  observed  variables.  Two 
models  were  considered,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Model  1 
assumes  that  suprailiac  and  subscapular  influence  BMI 
and  that  BMI  influences  hypertension.  Model  2  assumes 
that  suprailiac,  subscapular,  and  BMI  influence  hyper-
tension  simultaneously. 
    In  an  SEM,  the  goodness-of-fit  index  (GFI)  measures 
the  relative  differences  between  the  data  and  estimated 
values  obtained  from  a  model,  while  the  adjusted  GFI 
(AGFI)  adjusts  the  GFI  according  to  the  degrees  of 
freedom.  If  these  two  measures  are  close  to  1,  we  can 

conclude  that  the  model  fits  the  data  well.  The  Akaike 
information  criterion  (AIC)  is  a  well-known  measure  that 
can  be  used  for  model  comparisons.  The  smaller  the 
AIC,  the  better  the  model  is.  Three  types  of  good-
ness-of-fit  measures  were  evaluated  to  select  the  best 
model  of  the  two  models:  for  model  1,  GFI=0.791, 
AGFI=0.793,  and  AIC=1132.005;  and 
for  model  2, 
GFI=0.774,  AGFI=0.776,  and  AIC=1290.599.  In  general, 
models  with  GFI  and  AGFI  measures  closer  to  1  and 
with  smaller  AICs  are  considered  to  fit  well.  As  GFI  and 
AGFI  were  close  to  1  for  both  models,  both  models  fit 
the  data  well.  But,  model  1  showed  a  bigger  GFI  and

AGFI  with  a  smaller  AIC  than  model  2;  model  1  was  se-
lected  to  be  the  final  model.  Through  a  comparison  be-
tween  two  models,  we  concluded  that  suprailiac  and 
subscapular  indirectly  affect  hypertension  susceptibility 
by  influencing  BMI.

Discussion

Most  GWASs  have  focused  on  single-SNP  analyses  of 
single  traits.  The  result  of  a  single-SNP  analysis  is  lim-
ited  to  correlations  between  candidate  susceptible  loci 
and  single  traits.  In  this  study,  we  conducted  a  gene- 
and  pathway-based  analysis  beyond  single-SNP  analy-
sis.  Based  on  the  gene-  and  pathway-based  analysis, 
we  proposed  the  use  of  SEMs  to  construct  a  model  for 
causal  relationships  among  genetic  factors  and  risk  fac-
tors  in  terms  of  traits  through  an  underlying  biological 
pathway. 
    The  gene-based  analysis  detected  more  significant 
genes  than  the  single-SNP  analysis.  We  demonstrate 
that  gene-based  analysis  is  a  powerful  method  to  detect 
genes  that  are  associated  with  traits.  A  gene-based 
analysis  is  also  easier  to  interpret,  as  function  and  the 
relevant  disease  with  a  gene  are  better  investigated  than 
a  SNP. 
    A  pathway-based  analysis  was  conducted  to  find 
pathways  that  were  significantly  correlated  with  each 
phenotype.  In  our  analysis,  a  pathway  that  was  asso-
ciated  with 
in  common  was  detected. 
Pathway-based  analysis  provides  a  more  comprehensive 
understanding  of  the  biological  process  of  complex 
traits  than  a  gene-based  or  single-SNP  analysis. 
    SEM  was  used  to  identify  the  relationship  among  risk 
factors  of  a  complex  trait.  In  this  study,  SEMs  were 
used  to  model  how  upper  body  fat  distribution,  repre-
sented  by  suprailiac  and  subscapular,  and  average  body 

traits 

four 

fat  distribution,  represented  by  BMI,  were  related  with 
hypertension.  Although  we  fit  a  limited  number  of  SEMs, 
we  demonstrated  that  SEM  analysis  is  useful  in  inves-
tigating  complex  biological  phenomena,  because  it  al-
lows  us  to  present  complex  causal  relationships  in 
equations  and  express  them  in  path  diagrams  and  be-
cause  it  deals  better  with  correlated  variables  that  occur 
frequently  in  biological  data. 
    However,  SEM  has  some  limitations.  It  requires  an  ini-
tial  model  to  start  with.  SEM  is  constructed  under  strict 
multivariate  normality  and  independence  assumptions 
among  errors.  Another  difficulty  is  that  run  time  in-
creases  substantially  as 
the  number  of  variables 
increases.
