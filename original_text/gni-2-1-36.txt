Abstract 

Astrocytes play supportive roles for  neurons in the brain. 
Recently,  they  have  been  accepted  to  have  various 
functions in the vascular system as well  as in the nervous 
system.  We  investigated the differential  gene expression 
in  rat  astrocytes according to the oxygen tension,  which 
is a crucial  factor for angiogenesis.  A eDNA microarray 
was  performed to find the genes whose expression was 
sensitive to oxygen  tension.  We  found 26 genes in the 
astrocyte were found and classified  into 4 groups.  In 
order to show the genes' 
relevancy to angiogenesis, 
seven of the 26 genes were  investigated to see whether 
they have capabilities of interaction with angiogenesis(cid:173)
related  factors in AngioDB.  Through this investigation, 
we 
three  proteins  with 
angiogenesis-related factors.  These genes were further 
investigated with  a new focus on the vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF)  expression  in an  astrocyte based 
on our  hypothesis that astrocytes can  have effects on 
endothelial  angiogenesis  via  the  release  of  VEGF. 
Collectively,  we 
identified  several  genes  whose 
expressions were dependent on the oxygen concentration 
of the astrocyte.  Furthermore,  the relevancy of  astrocytes 
to  angiogenesis  was  investigated  using  preexisting 
information  of  AngioDB,  and  suggested  a  possible 
signaling pathway for VEGF expression in the aspects 
of  brain  endothelial  angiogenesis  by  astrocytes.

Introduction 
Astrocytes,  the  most  numerous  glial  cells,  have  been 
regarded  as  the  supportive cells  of  the  brain.  They aid 
neurons  in  maintaining  a  good  condition  through 
nourishing,  protecting,  and  modulating  growth  and 
excitability  (Travis,  1994).  They  also  function  as 
scavengers that  rapidly  capture  transmitters  that  are 
released  during  synaptic activity.  It  was  also  reported 
that  some  types  of  astrocytes can  protect  neurons  from 
oxidative  stress  (Shih  et a!.,  2003). 

Moreover,  astrocytes are  known  to  have various 
important  roles  that  are  related  to  the  vascular system 
as  well  as  being  related  to  the  supportive  roles  for  neuron 
growth  and  maintenance.  Therefore,  astrocytes  have 
come to  be  known  as  "the  bridge"  between  the  nervous 
and  vascular  systems  (Parri  et al,  2003).  In  fact,  astrocytes 
are  in  contact  with  both  neuronal  synapses  and 
microvessels.  For  instance,  signaling  that  involves the 
glutamate and  calcium  ions  between  the  neuron  and 
astrocyte  is a  significant  factor  in  the  control  of  brain 
microcirculation  (Zonta  et al,  2003).  Astrocytes  are also 
involved  in  the  process of  blood-brain  barrier  (BBB) 
differentiation.  BBB  is  a  well-differentiated  network of 
brain  microvessels  that  provides  homeostasis.  It  is  known 
that  BBB  development  can  be  classified  into  brain 
angiogenesis  and  BBB  differentiation.  Brain  capillaries 
go through  differentiation  with  the  astrocyte,  and  these 
capillaries  become  more  mature  and  are  remodeled  into 
a  BBB  that  is  impermeable  (Janzer  et at.,  1987,  Lee  et 
al,  2003).  Astrocytes  can  be  involved  in  both  the  nervous 
system  and  the  vascular  system.  Recently,  many 
neurobiologists  and  vascular  biologists  have  been 
interested  in  the  coordinated  interaction  between  the 
vascular  and  nervous systems  (Park  et al,  2003).  Herein, 
we  held  an  anatomical  and  functional  focus  in  exploring 
the  characteristics of  astrocytes  that  could  be the  linker 
between  the  two  different  systems. 

Oxygen  tension  plays a  crucial  role  in  the  vascular 
development  (Maltepe  et al,  1998).  Angiogenesis,  which 
is  the  process  of  new  vessel  formation,  is  very tightly 
controlled  by oxygen  concentration  levels.  Therefore,  we 
hypothesized  that oxygen  tension  would  be a  key factor 
in  gene expression  of  astrocytes that  can  be a  part of 
the  vascular  system  as well  as  the  nervous  system. 
Moreover,  it  is  expected  that some  genes  in  the astrocyte, 

In  Silica  Screening  for  Angiogenesis-Related  Genes  in  Rat  Astrocytes  37 

which  illustrated  different  expression  patterns  in  various 
oxygen  conditions,  could  have  an  effect  on  angiogenesis 
of  brain  microvessels.  Therefore,  a eDNA  microarray was 
performed  in  order to  screen  genes whose  expression 
level  varied  according  to the  oxygen  conditions  including 
normoxia  (normal  level  of  oxygen),  hypoxia  (low  level 
of  oxygen),  and  reoxygenation  (recovery of  oxygen  level). 
Among  the  selected  genes,  Smad4,  p62,  and  Bcl-2 
associated  death  promoter  (BAD)  were  investigated  using 
some  factors  in  AngioDB  in  order to  examine  their 
interaction  with  angiogenesis-related  proteins.  AngioDB 
is  the  database that  consists  of  angiogenesis-related 
molecules  and  their  signaling  networks  (Sohn  eta!.,  2002). 
The  list  of  angiogenesis-related  molecules  in  AngioDB 
was  used,  and  it  was  focused  on  the VEGF  signaling 
networks  based  on the  fact  that  it  is a key  factor  in  the 
induction  of  angiogenesis. 

Methods 

Cell  culture 
A  rat  lung  epithelial  cell  line  (L2)  as  the  control  group 
in  the  microarray  hybridization  was  cultured  in  RPMI  1640 
with  10o/o  FBS  (Life Technologies),  100 U/ml  penicillin 
streptomycin.  Culture  environment  of  L2  cell  line was 
maintained  at 31 C.  An  immortalized  rat  astrocyte cell 
line  was  cultured  in  DMEM  supplemented  with  10o/o  FBS 
(Life  Technologies),  20  mM  Sodium  bicarbonate,  and 
100  U/ml  penicillin  streptomycin.  Hypoxic  condition  was 
maintained  in  a  hypoxia  chamber  (Forma  Scientific)  that 
provided  a  low oxygen  tension  (5o/o  C02  with  1o/o  02, 
balanced  with  N~ for  hypoxic  condition.  After  exposure 
to  hypoxia,  they were  returned  to the  ambient  atmosphere, 
supplied  with  fresh  medium  and  continuously  incubated 
for  the  condition  of  reoxygenation.

Oxygen  tension  conditioning  procedures  and  RNA 
isolation 

Fig.  1 shows  experimental  scheme.  Each  experiment  was 
done  in  tripicates.  The  duration  of  hypoxia  was  for  16 
h.  The  temperature  in  hypoxia  was  maintained  at  31 C 
In  this  case,  RNA  isolation  time  point  was  adapted t~ 
different  periods of  reoxygenation  (0.5  h,  9 h).  RNA was 
extracted  by standard  methods.  Cells were  lysed  using 
TRizol  reagent  (Life  Technologies),  and  total  RNA  was 
isolated  according  to the  manufacturer's  instructions. 
Extracted  RNA was  subjected  to further  purification  using 
and  RNeasy  mini  kit  (Quiagen).  The  quality and  quantity 
of  extracted  total  RNA samples  were  evaluated  by loading 
a  specific amount  of  each  sample  on  a  denaturating 
agarose  gel. 

Microarray  hybridization 

Microarray experiment  was  performed  according  to the 
technical  manual  of  DNA  dendrimer  probe  reagents 
(3DNA114  Array 50114  Expression  Array  Detection  reagents, 
Genisphere).  Each  RNA and  Cy3 or  Cy5  capture sequence 
primers  were  incubated  for  10  min  at  80° C.  At  42° c 
an  equal  volume  of  reaction  mix  was  added,  and  the 
reaction  was  incubated  2 h.  The  reaction  was  terminated 
by  bringing  it  to  0.074  N  NaOH  and  7.4  mM  EDTA. 
Concentrated  eDNA tagged  with  capture  sequence  was 
mixed  with  hybridization  buffer(40% formamide  4x sse 
1%  SDS).  The  mixture was  hybridized  to  Gen~Track rat 
arrays  (GenomicTree),  which  contained  more than  5000 
of  genes and  expressed  sequence tags.  After  incubation 
at  45o C overnight,  the  arrays were  washed  and  dried. 
Then,  3DNA Array  50  Cy3  and  Cy5  reagents  (Genisphere) 
was  hybridized  to  the  arrays and  incubated  at  50° C 
for  3 h.  After  hybridization,  the  arrays were  washed  and 
dried.  The  hybridized  probe array was  scanned  by 
microarray scanner  GenePix 4000B  (Axon  Instruments) 
with  GenePix  Pro  4.0 (Axon  Instruments) as  analysis 
software.  GenePix  Pro  4.0  performed  global  normalization 
every scanning.  R(http:// www.r-project.org) was  used 
in  normalization  of  all  arrays.  We  used J-Express to cluster 
and  generate candidates  whose  expression  would  be 
changed  by oxygen  tension  (http:/ /www.ii.uib.no/ ~ 
bjarted/jexpress/). 

Microarray  data  analysis 

Gene  expression  profiles  from  the  four  different  oxygen 
conditions  were  analyzed  using  the  self-organizing  map 
(SOM)  algorithm.  We  constructed  a 16-partition SOM  (data 
not  shown).  A  16-partition  SOM 
represented 
distinguishable expression  pattern  between  clusters 
Next,  we  selected  only 4 groups of  the  gene expressio~ 

patterns  that  were  thought  to  be  biologically  mE~ningful: 
increased  at  hypoxia;  decreased  at  hypoxia  and 
recovered  at  reoxygenation;  increased  at  early 
reoxygenation  (30  min  reoxygenation  after  exposure to 
hypoxia);  decreased  at  early  reoxygenation.  After 
selection  of 4 groups,  we  found  the  genes among  them 
whose  expression  was  more  sensitive to  oxygen  tension 
under the  criteria:  1)  ratio  was~ 2.0-fold as  increased, 
2)  ::;o.5-fold as  decreased.  As  shown  in  Table  1  there 
are  26  clones  whose  expressions are dramatically 
changed  by  oxygen  concentration.

Analysis  of  interactions  with  factors  in  AngioDB. 

The  selected  genes  in  the  results  from  microarray 
screening  were  analyzed  using  the  database,  AngioDB 
(http:/ /angiodb.  snu.ac.kr).  The  analysis  of  interactions 
was  based  on  the  information  in  PubMed.  We  draw the 
network using  Cytoscape  (http:/ /cytoscape.org),  which 
is  a  bioinformatics  software  platform  for  visualizing 
molecular  interaction  networks. 

Results 

Selection  of  candidate  genes  and  investigation  of 
interactions  with  angiogenesis-related  factors 
Twenty-six genes from  the  eDNA  microarray  analysis 
were  selected  according to  the  criteria  described  in  the 
Methods.  In  Table  1,  the  expression  level  was  represented 
as  the  relative  ratio  to  the  level  at  normoxia.  To  study 
relevancy of  the  factors  involved  in  angiogenesis,  an 
investigation  of  interactions  was  performed  using  the  data 
in  AngioDB.  AngioDB  is  a database of  angiogenesis and 
angiogenesis-related  molecules  in  human,  which 
includes  identification,  functional  classification,  and 
bibliographic  references.  The  known  genes  were the 
center  of  focus  because we  analyzed  interactions  using 
preexisting  information  in  PubMed.  Therefore,  among  the 
26  genes,  15  ESTs  were  excluded  at the  beginning  of 
the  analysis.  Then,  some  genes  that  were thought  to 
be appropriate for  this  analysis were  selected  among 
the  rest  of  the  11  known  genes,  which  encode  for  PMF31, 
inhibitor  of  DNA  binding  1 (ld-1),  Smad4,  PKC-' 
-interacting  protein  (ZIP),  CL3BC,  BAD,  ADP-ribosylation 
factor-like 1 (ARL1),  eiF-2B a  subunit,  NGF-inducible 
anti- proliferative  protein  PC3  (PC3),  Regulator  G protein 
signaling  8  (RGS8),  and  Stat5B.  Among  these,  PMF31 
and  CL3BC  were  excluded  because  human  homologs 
cannot  be  found.  Additionally,  inhibitor  of  DNA  binding 
1 and  Stat5B  were  also  excluded  for  our  study  because 
they  were  already well  reported  to  be  involved  in 
angiogenic  pathways  (Benezra  et at.,  2001;  Dentelli  et 

In  Silica  Screening  for  Angiogenesis-Related  Genes  in  Rat  Astrocytes  39 

a/.,  1999).  Finally,  7 genes  for  the  interaction  analysis 
were  selected:  Smad4 and  p62 in  the  group of  genes 
that  increased  at  hypoxia;  BAD,  ARL!,  e/F-28 a-subunit, 
PC3,  and  RGSB in  the  group of  genes  that  increased 
during  early  reoxygenation.  In  analyzing  the  interactions 
with  angiogenesis-related  factors,  the  results  indicate 
that  4  out  of  7 proteins,  ARL1,  eiF-2B a-subunit,  PC3, 
and  RGS8,  had  no  interaction  with  factors  stored  in 
AngioDB.  Fig.  2 shows  the  primary  interactions of  the 
remaining  three  proteins,  Smad4,  p62,  and  BAD,  with 
angiogenesis-related  factors.  According  to  this 
interaction  analysis,  Smad4  interacts  with  7 angiogenesis 
-related  factors:  Sp1,  TGF-/1,  Jun,  UBC9,  CREB,  Jab1, 
and  haptoglobin;  p62  interacts with  p53,  angiotensin, 
TrkA,  Fos,  PKC,  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  (EGFR), 
NF-JCB,  Ras,  and  Sp1;  BAD  interacts with  eight  other 
proteins:  TGF-/1,  IL2,  HBx,  haptoglobin,  PKC,  NF-JCB, 
BRCA  1,  and  nerve  growth  factor  (NGF). 

Extended  investigation  of  interactions  focusing  on 
the  VEGF  signaling 

Above,  it  was  found  that  molecules  are  involved  in 
angiogenesis  and  they  interact  with  candidates  that 
resulted  from  the  eDNA  microarray analysis  by using 
preexisting  information  from  AngioDB  without  additional 
biological  experiments.  It  would  be  possible  to  further 
study these  factors  in  order  to  discover the  role  in 
angiogenesis.  However,  such  that  trial  would  be  still 
arduous;  because  it  needs  to  screen  a  wide  range  of 
possibilities  that  could  be  considered  as  elucidating  an 
obvious  relationship  between  the  gene  expression  in  the 
astrocyte and  brain  angiogenesis.  If  astrocytes  represent 
the  effect  of  angiogenesis  on  endothelial  cells,  one  of 
the  possible  paths  for  regulating  angiogenesis  can  be 
the  secretion  of  VEGF,  an  endothelial  cell-specific 
mitogen  that  plays  an  important  role  in  angiogenesis. 
Herein,  the  factors  that  can  act  on  the  expression  of 

VEGF  were  extracted  from  the  data  in  AngioDB,  and 
then,  the  factors  interacting  with  Smad4,  p62,  and  BAD 
were  investigated.  The  focus  was  on  primary  interactions 
of  Smad4,  p62,  and  BAD  with  the  factors  that  influence 
VEGF  expression.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  we  integrated 
interactions  and  constructed  the  networks.  Smad4  can 
act on  VEGF  expression  via  Sp1  and  TGF-p;  p62  can 
do the  same  via  angiotensin,  Ras,  PKC,  and  Sp1.  The 
interaction  of  BAD  was  different from  those  of  Smad4 
and  p62.  On  the  interaction  network,  it  was  impossible 
to  be  linked  via  only  one  factor  from  BAD  to  VEGF.  There 
were  only two  angiogenesis-related  factors,  NF-JCB  and 
IL2,  receiving  a signal  from  BAD  on  the  interaction  network. 
These  proteins  did  not  have  a  direct  effect  on  VEGF 
on  the  network.  Therefore,  further  investigation  of  primary 
interactions  for  NF-JCB  and  IL2  was  performed  because 
it  was  expected  that  there  would  be  some  linkages  to 
VEGF  among  interactions  with  other  factors  that  were 
involved  in  angiogenesis.  The  network  in  Fig.  4  shows 
interactions  concentrating  on  NF-JCB,  IL2,  and  the 
relationship  with  factors  that  directly  interact with  VEGF. 

toward  VEGF 

Inference  of  signaling  pathways 
expression 
Based  on  the  networks,  we  inferred  which  signaling 
pathways Smad4,  p62  and  BAD  were  involved  in  (Table 
2).  First,  Smads  protein  is  involved  in  the  TGF-/1 signaling 
pathway  (Derynck  eta/.,  1998).  Reportedly,  TGF-/1  has 
the  effect  of  angiogenesis-activation  (Roberts  et at.,  1986). 
Presumption  for  Smad4,  however,  is  somehow  complex. 
Smad4  plays  a  pivotal  role  affecting  all  TGF-/1  signaling 
and  also  has  a  tumor  suppressor  effect.  Additionally, 
while  TGF-/1  also  has  other  attributes  to  inhibit  epithelial 
cell  growth,  induce differentiation  or apoptosis,  and 
maintain  genomic  stability  (Howe  eta/.,  1998),  TGF-/1 
has  a  neuroprotective effect  by  blocking  apoptosis 
through  phosphorylation  of  BAD  (Zhu  eta!.,  2002).

Therefore,  the  output  of  Smad4  and  TGF-,8  signaling 
depends on  various  physiological  phenomena  and  cell 
types.  For  our  analysis,  the  focus  was  on  the  interactions 
that  would  be  involved  in  VEGF  expression  when  the 
oxygen  condition  was  altered.  Sp  1 was  reported  to 
activate VEGF  transcription  (Reisinger  et a/.,  2003),  and 
Smad4  associates  with  and  positively  interacts  with  Sp1 
(Pardali  eta/.,  2000).  Therefore,  Smad4  can  mediate  TGF(cid:173)
,8  signaling  in  VEGF  expression,  or  Smad4  can  be  the 
upstream factor  for  Sp1-mediated  VEGF  induction.  Taken 
together,  Smad4,  whose  mRNA  level  was  increasingly 
expressed  at  hypoxia,  is  possibly  involved  in  the  induction 
of  VEGF  via  interactions  with  Sp1  and  TGF-,8.  Furthermore, 
in  the  long  run,  it  can  lead  to  endothelial  angiogenesis 

by  astrocytes. 

Second,  like  Smad4,  ZIP  was  also  increased  at  hypoxia 
in  the  results  of  the  microarrays.  ZIP  was  isolated  from 
a  rat  brain  eDNA  library and  was  known  to  interact  with 
the  regulatory  domain  of  PKC-' (Puis  eta/.,  1997).  The 
human  ZIP  homolog  that  encodes a  cytosoilc  62-kDa 
protein  (p62)  was  identified  and  cloned  (Park  eta/.,  1995). 
As  the  result  of  the  interaction  network,  p62  can  induce 
the  VEGF  expression  via  interactions with  PKC,  Sp1, 
angiotensin,  and  Ras.  PKC-' is  an  intermediary  molecule 
for  Ras-mediated  overexpression  of  VEGF  (Pal  eta/., 
2001).  Conversely,  p62  acts  as  a  negative  regulator  of 
Ras  (Di  Cristofano  eta/.,  2001).  Therefore,  p62  is  likely 
to  play  a  role  as  the  decisive  regulator  of  PKC-i' signaling

Smad4  can  act  on  VEGF  expression  via  Sp1  and  TGF-{3  ;  p62  can  do  via  angiotensin,  Ras,  PKC,  and  Sp1.  However,  angiogenesis-related 
factors  receiving  signal  from  BAD  were  just  two,  NF-JC  B and  IL -2 on  the  network.  These  proteins  did  not  have  a direct  effect  on  VEGF 
on  the  interaction  network.

Fig.  4.  Extended  interaction  network  via  NF  kappa  B and  IL2 
The  network was  an  extended  form  of  it in  Fig.  3.  This  extended  network shows  interactions  concentrating  on  NF-"  B,  IL -2 and  the 
relationship  with  factors  directly  interacting  with  VEGF. 

for  VEGF  expression.  In  addition  to  signaling  via  PKC, 
Sp1,  and  Ras,  p62  also  interacts  with  angiotensin  II,  which 
has  been  reported  to  induce VEGF  expression  (Rizkalla 
eta/.,  2003).  Moreover,  p62  is  associated  with  angiotensin 
II  and  involved  in  angiotensin  11-mediated  signaling  (Lu 
eta/.,  1998).  Therefore,  p62  can  be a  regulator  of  either 
PKC-,-or  angiotensin  II- mediated  signaling. 

Finally,  BAD  is  a distant  member of  the  Bcl-2 family 
of  proteins  that  was  identified  as  a  Bcl-2-interacting 
protein  (Yang  eta!.,  1995).  Bcl2  and  Bcl-xl have 
anti-apoptotic effects,  while  other  members  of  the  Bcl-2 

family,  such  as  Bax and  BAD  are  pro-apoptotic molecules. 
In  terms  of  the  interaction  network,  there  was  not  a  path 
via  only one factor  from  BAD  to  VEGF.  As  shown  in  Fig. 
4,  there  is  a  wider  range  of  molecules  involved  in  the 
pathway from  BAD  to VEGF  through  the extension  to 
the  secondary  interaction  of  BAD  via  NF-KB and  IL2. 
From  the  results  of  the  microarray,  both  Smad4  and  p62 
were  increased  at  hypoxia,  while  BAD  was  dramatically 
induced at the  stage of  early  reoxygenation.  Considering 
hypoxia  is  closely connected  with  angiogenesis,  the  fact 
that  Smad4  and  p62  were  expressed  notably at  hypoxia

could  be  relevant  to  the  linkage  state  with  VEGF  in  just 
a 2-step  interaction  because  less  number  of  interactions 
might  generate  a  faster  effect  on  VEGF  expression  by 
upstream  factors.  BAD  being  increased  during  early 
reoxygenation  is  linked  to  VEGF  not  in  a 2--step  but  3--step 
interaction.  It  is  possible  for  BAD  to  be  linked  to  VEGF 
in  a  3-step interaction  due to  NF-"B and  IL2,  which 
are  major factors  involving  many  interacting  proteins. 
It  means  that  BAD  induce the  VEGF  expression  via  a 
number of  pathways,  but  the  specificity of  BAD  for  VEGF 
expression  might  be  reduced  because  once  BAD  interacts 
with  NF-!CB  and  IL2,  which  interact  with  a  huge  number 
of  molecules  in  the  various  biological  processes,  the  effect 
of  BAD  can  possibly  be  dispersed. 

Discussion 
Recently,  astrocytes  have  become  the  issue  of  interest 
because  it  has  been  reported  to  have  various  important 
effects  on  the  vascular  system  and  the  nervous  system. 
The  major  cell  type  involved  in  this  process  is  the 
endothelial  cell,  which  has  surface  receptors  to  which 
angiogenic factors  bind.  In  the  brain,  astrocytes are 
associated  with  endothelial  cells  of  the  brain  microvessels 
as  well  as  to  the  neurons.  Based  on  this  concept  that 
astrocytes  can  influence the  vascular  system,  the 
investigation  of  differential  gene  expression  in  astrocytes 
according  to  oxygen  tension  is  meaningful. 

Through  the  investigation  of  interactions  by  using  the 
data  in  AngioDB,  the  candidate  genes,  which  resulted 
from  the  microarray experiment,  were  suggested  to  be 
involved  in  angiogenesis-related  networks.  To  further 
study the  effects on  endothelial  angiogenesis,  we 
hypothesized  that  if  astrocytes  release  VEGF  depending 
on  oxygen  tension,  VEGF  can  induce  brain  angiogenesis 
around  them.  Therefore,  the  effects  of  Smad4,  p62,  and 
BAD  on  endothelial  angiogenesis were  judged from  their 
relationship  with  signaling  pathways that  are  relevant 
to  VEGF  expression.  Smad4  and  p62,  which  were 
increased  at  hypoxia,  can  lead  to  VEGF  via  just  one 
factor,  such  as  SP1,  Ras,  and  so  on.  On  the  other  hand, 
BAD,  which  illustrated  very  high  expression  levels  during 
early  reoxygenation,  can  influence VEGF  expression  in 
a 3-step interaction.  This  shows  that  considering  oxygen 
deficiency is  a crucial  factor  for  angiogenesis,  and  Smad4 
and  p62  were  connected  more  closely  with  VEGF 
expression  than  BAD.  This  also  signifies that  Smad4  and 
p62  increasing  at  hypoxia  can  rapidly  increase/regulate 
VEGF  expression.  In  addition,  through  the  inference  of 
the  signaling  pathway  for  VEGF  expression,  it  is  possible 
to  identify the  underlying  mechanism  of  some  phenomena 
as  well  as  the  potential  signaling  pathways  in 

angiogenesis.  For  example,  both  Smad4  and  p62  can 
be  linked  to  Sp1.  VEGF  expression  by oxidative  stress 
was  known  to  be  mediated  by the  Sp-1  and  Sp-3 
dependent  mechanism  (Schafer  eta/.,  2003).  Of  these, 
Smad4  and  p62,  which  are  sensitive  to  oxygen  tension, 
can  act  as  an  intermediary factor  for  Sp-1  signaling  that 
is  related  to  oxygen  concentration.  For  BAD,  instead  of 
being  involved  in  the  shorter  signaling  pathways  toward 
VEGF  expression,  it  might  be  involved  in  a  number of 
interactions  with  factors  having  effects  on  VEGF 
expression  via  NF-KB  and  IL2.  Then,  it  can  have  effects 
on  various  signaling  for  other  processes as  well  as  for 
VEGF  expression.  These  inferences  would  be  applied 
to  other  phenomena  that  occur  in  the  process  of 
reoxygenation  aside  from  hypoxia,  such  as  the  maturation 
of  the  newly  formed  blood  vessel  and  the  formation  of 
blood-brain  barrier. 

Collectively,  in  this  study,  the  eDNA  microarray was 
applied  to  the  screening  of  differential  gene  expression 
patterns  in  the  astrocyte  according  to  oxygen  tension. 
We  suggests  that  further  investigation  of  the  gene 
expression  data from  microarray experiments  can  be 
extended  by  building  interaction  networks  using 
previously characterized  information,  such  as  the  data 
in  AngioDB.  As  accepted,  the  eDNA  microarray  is  one 
of  the  best  methods  for  screening  expression  patterns 
of  thousands  of  genes  in  a single  experiment  and  finding 
candidate  genes that  are  responsive  to  a  specific 
condition  among  a  number  of  genes.  In  the  microarray 
analysis,  the  method  by which  the  biological  significance 
of  these  genes are  analyzed  and  identified  is  the  most 
important.  We  have  illustrated  new  approaches  for 
prediction  through  the  use  of  the  interaction  network and 
the  preexisting  information  that  was  previously 
characterized.
