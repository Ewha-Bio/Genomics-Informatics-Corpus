Abstract

The  association  between  adiponectin  concentration  and 
obesity  have  been  reported  and    genetic  variations  of 
the  ADIPOQ  gene  are  known  to  influence  the  plasmatic 
concentration  of  adiponectin.  Therefore,  we  investigated 
the  effect  of  AIPOQ  single  nucleotide  polymorphism 
(SNP)  on  obesity-related  variables,  and  their  modulation 
by  dietary  intakes  in  Korean  women.  The  subjects  con-
sisted  of  3,217  Korean  women  aged  40-59  years  partic-
ipating  in  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiology  Study 
(KoGES).  The  general  characteristics,  anthropometric  vari-
ables,  serum  blood  profiles  were  measured.  Dietary  in-
take  was  analyzed  using  the  Food  Frequency  Question-
naire.  Subjects  with  the  T  allele  of  AIPOQ  rs182052 
showed  significantly  higher  obesity-related  variables 
such  as  weight  (p=0.005),  BMI  (p＜0.000),  fat  body 
mass  (p=0.005),  and  waist-hip  ratio  (p=0.007)  than  those 
with  the  C  allele.  Moreover,  the  rs182052  T  allele  was 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  obesity  prevalence 
(p=0.019).  However,  there  were  not  any  significant  inter-
actions  observed  between  the  genotype  of  ADIPOQ 
rs182052  and  dietary  intake  on  BMI  and  fat  body  mass. 
These  findings  suggest  that  the  obesity-related  variables 
may  be  more  dominantly  affected  by  the  genotype  of 
ADIPOQ  rs182052  than  dietary  intake  in  middle  aged 
Korean  women.

Introduction

The  figure  of  obese  people  worldwide  was  at  least  400 
million  in  2005;  this  figure  is  predicted  to  rise  to  approx-
imately  2.3  billion  by  2015  (WHO,  2006).  The  primary 
cause  of  obesity  is  known  to  be  an  accumulation  of  ex-
cess  body  fat  occurring  through  an  imbalance  of  energy

intake  over  energy  expenditure  (Walker  et al.,  2007). 
However,  it  has  been  reported  that  genetic  variations 
may  influence  individuals  to  show  different  predis-
positions  to  obesity  (Fawcett  et al.,  2010;  Loos,  2009). 
ADIPOQ,  the  gene  coding  for  adiponectin,  is  located  on 
chromosome  3q27  and  is  expressed  in  adipose  tissue 
exclusively.  Several  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  in  the  ADIPOQ  gene  are  known  to  influence  the 
plasmatic  concentration  of  the  encoded  protein.  These 
SNPs  have  shown  a  linkage  to  obesity  as  well  as  type 
2  diabetes,  metabolic  syndrome,  cholesterol  concen-
tration  and  coronary  artery  disease  (Heid  et al.,  2010; 
Hivert et al.,  2008;  Kadowak et al.,  2006;  Li et al.,  2009; 
Ntall et al.,  2009).  In  particular,  the  genetic  variations  of 
rs182052  which  is  located  in  exon  1  of  the  ADIPOQ 
gene,  have  been  reported  to  be  associated  with  obe-
sity-related  variables  (Richardson et al.,  2006;  Wassel et 
al.,  2010).

Nowadays,  it  has  been  reported  that  an  association 
exists  between  genetic  variation  and  obesity,  and  the 
genetic  susceptibility  of  obesity  may  be  influenced  by 
one’s  dietary  intake  (Drewnowski,  2009;  Swithers  et al., 
2010).  For  instance,  the  associations  of  SNPs  of  the 
ADIPOQ  with  BMI  and  obesity  risk  were  modified  by  di-
etary  monounsaturated  fatty  acid  intake  (Warodomwichit 
et al.,  2009).  In  a  similar  manner,  the  interaction  of  diet-
ary  fiber  content  and  SNP  in  the  ADPOQ  could  have  an 
influence  on  childhood  obesity  (Ntalla  et al.,  2009).

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  examine  the  as-
sociation  between  SNP  in  AIPOQ  rs182052  with  obe-
sity-related  variables  such  as  weight,  BMI,  fat  body 
mass,  and  waist-hip  ratio,  and  its  modification  by  diet-
ary  intake  in  middle  aged  Korean  women  who  partici-
pated 
in  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiology  Study 
(KoGES). 

Methods

Subjects

The  study  subjects  consisted  of  3,217  Korean  women 
aged  between  40  to  59  years  who  participated  in  the 
Korean  Genome  Epidemiology  Study 
(KoGES).  The 
KoGES  were  performed  as  cohorts  for  chronic  disease 
(diabetes,  hypertension,  osteoporosis,  obesity  and  meta-
bolic  syndrome)  in  adults  aged  between  40-69,  who 
were  recruited  from  two  community-based  epidemiology 
studies  in  the  rural  Ansung  and  urban  Ansan  commun-

ities  from  2001  to  2008.  The  details  of  the  original  co-
hort  have  been  described  elsewhere  (Ahn  et al.,  2007; 
Cho et al.,  2009).  All  subjects  were  of  Korean  ancestry. 
Among  10,038  subjects  in  KoGES  who  were  available 
for  completed  FFQ  data  and  epidemiological  data,  the 
women  subjects  of  this  study  aged  between  40-59  were 
selected.  This  study  protocol  was  approved  by  the  in-
stitutional  Review  Board  of  Ewha  Womans  University 
Seoul,  Korea.

Methods

Anthropometric  variables  and  blood  pressure 

Body  weight,  height,  and  waist  circumference  were 
measured  using  a  standardized  procedure:  height  with-
out  shoes  by  an  anthropometer,  weight  in  light  clothes 
by  a  weighting  scale,  waist  circumference  over  the  un-
clothed  abdomen  at  a  minimal  diameter  by  non  stretch-
able  standard  tape.  Body  composition  (lean  body  mass, 
fat  body  mass,  and  Waist/Hip  ratio)  were  measured  by 
an  In-body  3.0  (Biospace  Co.,  Ltd,  Seoul,  Korea).  Body 
mass  index  (BMI)  was  calculated  by  dividing  the  weight 
in  kilograms  by  height  in  meters  squared.  Obesity  was 
defined  as  the  BMI  ≥25  kg/m2,  which  were  WHO  Asia- 
Pacific  Area  criteria  for  obesity  (WHO,  2000).

Systolic  blood  pressure  and  diastolic  blood  pressure 
were  measured  with  the  subject  in  a  lying  position  after 
5  minutes  of  rest.  The  average  number  of  three  blood 
pressure  readings,  which  were  conducted  in  between  in-
tervals  of  30  seconds,  was  used  for  analysis. 

Serum  blood  profile

After  8-14  h  of  overnight  fasting,  blood  samples  were 
collected  to  measure  plasma  glucose,  insulin,  total  cho-
lesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  and  triglycerides  using    the 
Hitachi  7600  Automatic  Analyzer  (Hitachi,  Tokyo,  Japan). 
LDL-Cholesterol  levels  were  calculated  by  the  following 
equations  described  by  Friedewald  for  subjects  with  a 
level  of  serum  triglycerides  ＜400  mg/dl  (Friedewald  et 
al.,  1972).
LDL-cholesterol= 
(Triglycerides/5)}]

Dietary  intake

The  usual  dietary  intake  during  the  previous  year  was 
assessed  with  a  Food  Frequency  Questionnaire  (FFQ) 
for  KoGES  which  has  been  validated  (Ahn et al.,  2007). 
It  includes  103  food  items  and  consists  of  both  a  3  por-
tion  size  and  9  frequency  of  serving.  Dietary  intake  data 
were  analyzed  using  Can-  Pro  3.0  software  (KNS., 

ADIPOQ  Gene  Polymorphism  and  Obesity    117

2006).  Intake  of  dietary  protein,  fat,  carbohydrate,  and 
fatty  acids  (Saturated  fatty  acid,  Monounsaturated  fatty 
acid,  and  Polyunsaturated  fatty  acid)  were  represented 
as  a  percentage  of  the  total  daily  energy  intake. 

Genotyping  and  single  nucleotide  polymorphism 
selection

Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  whole  blood  and 
genotyped  on  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP 
array  5.0  [22].  ADOPOQ  rs182052,  which  have  been  re-
ported  to  be  associated  with  obesity-related  variables  in 
the  previous  studies  (Henneman et al.,  2010;  Ong et al., 
2010;  Richardson et al.,  2006;  Wassel et al.,  2010),  were 
selected  among  SNPs  with  a  minor  allele  frequency 
(MAF)  ≥0.10  in  KoGES  GWA  study  data.

Statistical  analysis

All  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  for 
Windows  software  (version  17.  0;  SPSS  Inc.,  Chicago, 
IL)  with  a  level  of  significance  at  p＜0.05.  Allele  frequen-
cies  were  calculated  by  allele  counting  and  the  de-
parture  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  was  calculated 
by  the  Chi-square  test.  The  rs182052  was  evaluated 
with  different  genetic  inherent  models  and  a  codominant 
model  was  applied  in  analyses  of  this  study.  The  data 
for  continuous  variables  were  presented  as  mean  val-
ues±s.e.m.  or  n  (%).  General  linear  models  after  adjust-
ment  for  potential  confounders  were  applied  to  compare 
variables  according 
the  genotype  of  ADIPOQ 
rs182052.  Also,  interactions  between  the  genotype  of 
ADIPOQ  rs182052  and  dietary  intake  (as  dichotomous) 
were  examined  using  general  linear  models  after  adjust-
ment  for  potential  confounders.

Results  and  Discussion

The  genotype  distribution  of  SNPs  in  AIPOQ  rs182052 
was  in  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p=0.83),  and  the  mi-
nor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  of  SNP  in  AIPOQ  rs182052 
was  0.49.  This  MAF  in  Korean  population  observed  was 
different  from  those  in  the  population  of  other  nations, 
such  as  reported  figures  of  0.40  in  European  and 
African  populations  and  0.47  in  Chinese  and  Japanese 
populations  as  obtained  from  the  HapMap  data.

In  this  study,  significant  associations  between  obe-
sity-related  variables  and  SNP  in  ADIPOQ  rs182052 
were  found  (Table  1).  Subjects  with  the  minor  T  allele  of 
ADIPOQ  rs182052  had  greater  weight  (p=0.05),  BMI  (p
＜0.000),  fat  body  mass  (p=0.005),  and  waist-hip  ratio 
(p=0.007)  compared  to  those  with  C  allele  carrier  after 
adjustment  for  potential  confounders.  These  results  cor-

respond  to  other  studies  that  showed  an  association 
between  ADIPOQ  rs182052  and  BMI  (Richardson et al., 
2006)  or  waist  circumstance  (Wassel  et al.,  2010).  In 
particular,  Richardson et al.  (2006)  reported  that  the  mi-
nor  allele  of  ADIPOQ  rs182052  was  significantly  asso-
ciated  with  an  increase  in  BMI,  which  showed  to  be  in 
accordance  with  our  results. 

In  this  study,  the  systolic  and  diastolic  pressures  were 
significantly  higher  in  subjects  with  minor  T  allele  of 
ADIPOQ  rs182052  than  in  those  with  homozygous  C  al-
lele  carrier  after  adjustment  for  potential  confounders 
(Table  1).  The  genetic  variants  in  the  ADIPOQ  gene  were 
reported  to  influence  plasma  adiponectin  level,  and  one 
of  them  showed  an  association  with  elevated  blood 
pressures  (Henneman  et al.,  2010;  Ong  et al.,  2010). 
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  blood  profiles 
according  to  the  genotype  of  ADIPOQ  rs182052.

ADIPOQ  Gene  Polymorphism  and  Obesity    119

Our  data  showed  that  the  prevalence  of  obesity  was 
significantly higher in subjects with the T allele of ADIPOQ 
rs182052  than  in  those  with  homozygous  C  allele  car-
rier,  CC:  44.0%  and  TT:  48.7%  respectively,  after  ad-
justment  for  potential  confounders  (Table  1).  Moreover, 
the  odds  ratio  (OR)  for  obesity  prevalence  in  subjects 
with  ADIPOQ  rs182052  T  allele  was  significantly  higher 
compared  compared  to  those  with  C  allele  carrier  after 
adjustment  for  potential  confounders  (Fig.  1),  implying 
an  increased  risk  of  obesity  in  subjects  with  ADIPOQ 
rs182052  T  allele.  The  hypoadiponectinemia,  which  was 
reported  to  be  influenced  by  genetic  variations  of  the 
ADIPOQ  gene,  has  been  consistently  observed  in  asso-

ciation  with  obesity  (Gilardini et al.,  2006;  Weyer et al., 
2001).  Therefore,  it  can  be  postulated  the  ADIPOQ 
rs182052  polymorphism  might  influence  the  serum  adi-
ponectin,  and  increase  the  obesity-related  traits  and  the 
obesity  prevalence. 

The  dietary  intake  was  analyzed  to  examine  whether 
genetic  variations  affect  energy  intake.  No  significant 
differences  in  dietary  intakes  of  energy,  protein,  fat,  car-
bohydrate,  saturated  fatty  acid,  monounsaturated  fatty 
acid,  and  polyunsaturated  fatty  acid  were  observed 
among  groups  with  different  genotypes  of  ADIPOQ 
rs182052  (Table  2).  These  results  suggested  that  genetic 
variations  in  ADIPOQ  rs182052  might  not  influence  diet-

ary  intakes.

On  the  other  hand,  recent  studies  reported  that  the 
interaction  between  genetic  variations  and  obesity,  and 
dietary  intakes  potentially  modulated  the  risk  of  obesity 
as  well  metabolic  syndrome  (Chung et al.,  2009;  Ntalla 
et al.,  2009;  Santos et al.,  2006;  Warodomwichit et al., 
2009).  In  this  study,  the  interaction  between  different 
genotypes  of  ADIPOQ  rs182052  and  dietary  intake  on 
the  obesity-related  variables  such  as  BMI  and  fat  body 
mass  was  analyzed.  The  intakes  of  energy,  protein,  fat, 
carbohydrate,  saturated  fatty  acid,  monounsaturated  fat-
ty  acid,  and  polyunsaturated  fatty  acid  were  divided  ac-
cording  to  their  respective  medians.  significant  gene-di-
etary  intake  interactions  on  BMI  and  fat  body  mass  in 
genotypes  of  ADIPOQ  rs182052  (Table  3  and  4)  were 
not  observed,  suggesting  that  the  obesity-related  varia-
bles  in  women  aged  between  40-59  years  might  be 
more  dominantly  affected  by  genotype  of  ADIPOQ 
rs182052  than  dietary  intake. 

In  conclusion,  this  study  demonstrated  that  genetic 
variations  in  ADIPOQ  rs182052  are  directly  associated 
with  obesity-related  variables  such  as  weight,  BMI,  fat 
body  mass,  and  waist-hip  ratio  in  Korean  women.  More-
over,  the  risk  of  obesity  prevalence  was  also  affected  by 
variations  in  ADIPOQ  rs182052.  However,  we  failed  to 
discover  the  effects  of  interaction  between  gene  and  di-
etary  intake  on  obesity.  Further  studies  may  be  neces-
sary  to  elucidate  the  interaction  between  ADIPOQ  gene 
polymorphism  and  dietary  intakes  on  obesity-related 
variables,  and  confirm  our  results  through  measurement 
of  the  plasma  adiponectin  level.
