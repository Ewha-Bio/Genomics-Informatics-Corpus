Abstract 
In this paper, we consider the variable selection methods 
in the Cox model when a large number of gene expression 
levels are involved with survival time. Deciding which genes 
are associated with survival time has been a challenging 
problem  because  of  the  large  number  of  genes  and 
relatively small sample size (n «  p). Several methods for 
variable selection have been proposed in the Cox model. 
Among those, we consider least absolute shrinkage and 
selection  operator  (lASSO),  threshold  gradient  descent 
regularization (TGDR), and two different dustering threshold 
gradient  descent  regularization  (CTGDR)-the  K-means 
CTGDR and the hierarchical CTGDR-and compare these 
four  methods in  an  application  of lung  cancer data. 
Comparison  of  the  four  methods  shows  that  the  two 
CTGDR methods yield more compact gene selection than 
TGDR,  while  lASSO  selects  the  smallest  number  of 
genes.  When  these  methods  are  evaluated  by  the 
approach of Ma and Huang (2007), none ofthe methods 
shows satisfactory performance in separating the two risk 
groups using the log-rank statistic based on the risk scores 
calculated from the selected genes. However, when the risk 
~cores are calculated from the genes that are significant 
1n the Cox model, the performance of the log-rank statistics 
shows  that  the  two  risk  groups  are  well  separated. 
Especially,  the TGDR  method  has the  largest  log-rank 
statistic, and the K-means CTGDR method and the lASSO 
method  show similar performance,  but the  hierarchical 
CTGDR method has the smallest log-rank statistic.

Introduction 
One of main issues in survival analysis is to investigate the 
association of the survival  time of patients with various 
clinical covariates. The Cox model has been most popularly 
used for analyzing survival data and  provides predictive 
variables of survival time by using a variety of classical 
methods for variable selection, such as forward selection, 
backward elimination, and stepwise selection. However, 
classical methods such as stepwise selection procedures 
yield  a computational  problem when a large number of 
gene expression variables are involved in considering the 
as~oci.~tion of survival  time  and  often  suffer from  high 
vanab1hty.  In  addition,  variable  selection  can  be  more 
challenging  due  to  censoring  mechanisms  in  survival 
analysis. Shrinkage methods such as lASSO have been 
proposed for Cox's proportional hazards model based on 
partial  or  pseudo-partial  likelihoods  (Tibshirani,  1996; 
Tibshirani, 1997). LASSO is widely used and has shown 
good performance. Another regularization method is the 
TGDR method proposed by Gui and  Li  (2005), which  is 
used to identify a small number of individual genes and to 
build  predictive models based on those genes. 

On the other hand, it is Well known that there exist genes 
~ose expressions are highly correlated and should be put 
1nto dusters (Tamayo eta/., 1999). Cluster analysis methods 
have been employed in microarray studies to reduce the 
large number of genes into a small number of gene dusters. 
Once a small  number of gene clusters are constructed 
using methods such as K-means or hierarchical methods 
the mean expressions of genes within the same cluster ar~ 
computed and then used as covariates in the final model. 
However, this approach has a limitation of selecting the 
fe.at~re at the cluster level, which  implies that all genes 
w1th1n the selected clusters are included in the final model. 
Since it is not necessarily true that all genes are associated 
with  survival  time,  even though  genes within the same 
c!uster may ~ave correlated expressions, noisy genes may 
y1eld less reliable models. In order to incorporate the cluster 
structure into variable selection,  Ma and  Huang  (2007) 
pr~po~ed a clustering threshold gradient descent regu(cid:173)
lanzatlon ( CTGDR) rrethod in IM'lich feature selection is made 
at both the cluster level and the individual gene level within 
each cluster. The CTGDR method considers the cluster

structure and takes advantage of both the cluster-based 
and regularized variable selection methods. 

In this paper, we review four methods of variable selection 
and assess these methods for use in the Cox model when 
a large number of gene expression levels are involved in 
predicting survival time. Furthermore, these methods are 
evaluated  using  the  log-rank statistic to  compare  their 
performance. We describe the Cox proportional hazards 
model  and  review three methods-LASSO, TGDR and 
CTGDR--Ao allow researchers to choose the most appro(cid:173)
priate method for selecting variables. The performances of 
these methods are compared using a data set of lung carci(cid:173)
nomas published on the PNAS website (www. pnas.org), 
and  at www.genome.wi.mit.edu/ MPR/Iung,  and  a dis(cid:173)
cussion is given. 

Model and Methods 
The Cox proportional hazards model 
Consider the  survival  data  setup,  Y= (X, D.),  where 
X= min ( T,  C)  and  D.  =I( T ~ C). Here, T and C denote 
the survival time and censoring time, respectively, and Z 
denotes the covariate vector. The Cox model (Cox, 1972) 
assumes that the conditional hazard function is independent 
of the time, t, given as: 

A,(t I Z) = Au(t)exp(jJ' Z) 

where .\0 (t)is the unknown baseline hazard function 
and {3  is the regression coefficient. One usually estimates 
the parameter f3  in the Cox model without specification of 
.\0 (t)  through  maximization  of  the  partial  likelihood 
function,  defined by: 

L(jJ) = TI { exp(p 'Z,) 
i=l  L  exp(jJ' Zj) 

JEr, 

)"' 

where  r;  = {j: Ti::::::  'li}  is the risk set at time  7i  and 

o;  =I( 1j  ~ c;)  is an uncensored indicator functio~. 

Methods 
We  reviewed  three  methods  for  selecting  susceptible 
genes among a large number of genes for relatively small 
sizes. There is a wide variety of regularization methods 
depending on how they define the objective functions with 
regularizing  parameters.  Here,  LASSO,  TGDR,  and 
CTGDR will be compared in the study of the association 
between survival time and gene expression levels in the 
Co~ model. 

LASSO 
Denote the log partial likelihood function by 1!((3) =log L(f3) 
and assume that the covariates Z;i are standardized so that 
:E ;.Z;/n = o and.  :E ;Z;;In = 1.  In the  linear regression 
setting,  Tibshirani  (1996)  proposed  minimization of the 
residual sum of squares, subject to a constraint of the form 
:E I,Bjl  ~ 8  and  called  the  resulting  procedure  LASSO 
.Therefore, the estimator of f3  is obtained via the following 
criterion: 

,a=arg min t(,B) subject to :E I,B)  ~ 8 

J 

where  8  > o is a user-specified parameter.  Suppose 
that  f3  ,  are  the  estimates  that  maximize  the  partial 
likelihood. Then,  if D~ 1 
:<:::  s, the solutions are the usual 
partial  likelihood  estimates.  If  'EI.B):::: s,  however,  the 
solutions are shrunken toward zero. The attractive feature 
of LASSO is that quite often some of the solution coefficients 
are exactly zero, whereas the ridge regression approach 
shrinks coefficients but does not give coefficients that are 
exactly zero. LASSO is a tool for achieving a parsimonious 
model and provides a more interpretable final  model. 

As  described  in  Tibshirani  (1997),  the  estimation 
procedure of LASSO is expressed by the usual Newton(cid:173)
Raphson update as an iterative reweighted least squares 
step,  replacing  the  weighted 
least  squares  step  by  a 
constrained  weighted  least  squares  procedure.  Let  H 
denote the design matrix of regressor variables and 17 = H,B, 
define u= ~.A=- 02 
fT  andy= 1]+ A- 1u  (see Hastie and 

&rJ 

01)1) 

Tibshirani,  1990).  Using  a  one-term  Taylor  series 
expansion  for  /!((3)=  (y-1])T A(y-ry),  we  solve  the 
problem  Then,the  solution  of LASSO  is  obtained  by 
iterating  the  following  procedure  given  by  Tibshirani 
(1997): 

1.  Fix sand initialize~= o. 
2. Compute 17,  u,  A  and y  based on the current value 

of S. 

3. Minimize (y- Hf3)r A(y- H,B)  subject to 'E 1 .B;  1 :<:::  s. 
4.  Repeat step 2 and 3 until  ~ does not change. 

One difficulty with the above procedure is that A is a full 
of matrix,  and  hence  it  requires  computation  of  O(N2
) 
elements. To avoid this, we replace A with a diagonal matrix 
D that has the same diagonal elements as A. As argued 
by Hastie and Tibshirani (1990, pp.212-213), the diagonal 
elements of A are larger than the off-diagonal elements, 
and hence the modified algorithm should behave similarly 
to the original one. 

An Application of CTGDR Method for Selecting Genes in  Predicting the Survival Time  97 

TGDR 
In fitting data based on linear models, the gradient descent 
pathfinding paradigm can  be generalized to include the 
use of a wide variety of loss  criteria,  leading  to  robust 
methods for regression and  classification,  as well  as to 
apply user-defined constraints on the parameter values. 
The  paths  induced  by  ridge  regression  (RR},  gradient 
regularization (GD), and LASSO differ in how they define 
the  interior  points  along  their  respective  paths.  With 
gradient descent-based procedures, one way to direct the 
path 
toward  parameter  points  with  more  diverse 
component values is to increase the diversity of the factor 
values  with  a  threshold  parameter.  The  following 
procedure  explains  briefly  how  to  perform  threshold 
gradient descent regularization. 

Denote  .6.v  as  the  small  positive  increment  as  in 
ordinary gradient descent methods (see  Friedman  and 
Popescu, 2004 ).  In the implementation of this algorithm, 
we choose .6.v = 1 x  10- 4
. Denote vk = k x  .6.v as the index 
for the point along the parameter path after k  steps. Let 
~( vk) denote the parameter estimate corresponding to vk. 
For any fixed  threshold,  0:::;; T:::;;  1 , the TGDR algorithm 
consists of the following steps: 

1.  Initialize ~(0)=0 and  v0 =  o. 
2.  With  current  estimate  ~.  compute  the  negative 
gradient  g(v) =-aL((J)/a(J.  Denote 
j-th 
~mP?nentof g(v)  as gj(v) .If maxj{lgj(v)l}, stop the 
1terat1ons. 

the 

3. Compute the threshold vector f ( v) of length d, where the 
j-th COmponent Of j(v): J1(v)  =  I{lg1(v)l  :2:  TXmax1lg1(v)} 
4.Update  (3(v+.6.v)=(3(v)-.6.vxg(v)Xf(v)  and 
update v by v+ .6.v, where the product off and g is 
component-wise. 

5.  Steps  2-4  are  repeated  K  times.  The  number of 

iterations K  is determined by cross validation. 

Here, the property of~ is determined by tuning parameters 
'  and K.  For example,  ~ is dense even for small values of K 
for'~ 0 , while~ is sparse for small values of K and remains 
so  for  a  relatively  large  number  of  iterations,  but  will 
become dense eventually for'~ 1 . For the extreme case 
of'= 1, the TGDR method usually increases in the direction 
of a single covariate in each iteration. For the middle range 
ofT, the characteristics of~ are between those for •=0 and 
•=1.  For •* 0, variable selection can  be achieved with 
cross-validated, finite K,  by having certain components of 
~ exactly zero. 
CTGDR 
While  the  TGDR  method  deals  with  individual  gene 
selection  but  does  not  take  into  account  the  cluster 

structure, the CTGDR method considers both individual 
gene selection and cluster structure. Ma and Huang (2007) 
discussed two na"lve CTGDR algorithms. The first na"ive 
CTGDR method modifies step 3 of TGDR as follows: 

where o :::;;  T1  :::;;  1  is the threshold  tuning parameter. 
This  algorithm  uses  cluster  gradients  to  replace  the 
individual gradients and considers the combined effects 
of genes in the same clusters, which implies that the genes 
within the same clusters may have different contributions 
in the final model, while all genes within the same clusters 
have equal contributions to the final  model in traditional 
cluster-based methods. 

The second na"ive CTGDR method modifies step 3 by 

replacing f  in step 3 of TGDR with 

so that each gene is compared only with other genes within 
the  same  cluster and  only  important  genes from  each 
cluster are selected. This algorithm is roughly equivalent 
to  carrying  out  the  TGDR  method  in  each  cluster 
separately, and the final model includes genes selected 
from all clusters. 

In summary, the first na·ive CTGDR method carries out 
cluster selection but does not select important genes with 
each  cluster,  while  the  second  na"ive  CTGDR method 
carries out gene selection in each cluster separately but 
does not select clusters. By combining the strengths of the 
two na"lve algorithms, Ma and Huang (2007) proposed the 
CTGDR method that incorporates cluster structure into 
TGDR-based variable selection. 

Let T1 ,  T2 E  [o, 1]  be two threshold parameters.  In step 

3 of the TGDR algorithm, define 

f(v) =  f)(v)xf 2 (v) 

1 

' 

where l  (v)  and l  (v)  are defined in the first na"ive 
CTGDR  and  the  second  na"lve  CTGDR  methods, 
respectively.  Then/ (v)  carries  out  cluster  selection, 
while l  (v) carries out within-cluster gene selection. The 
combined CTGDR carries out feature selection both at the 
cluster  level  and  within  the  cluster  level.  By  allowing 
different threshold values of T1 and T2 , more flexible results 
can be obtained. 

Like the TGDR method, the properties of the CTGDR 
estimates are determined by the three tuning parameters 

98  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  5(3) 95-101, September2007 

K,  7 1, and 7 2 • If 7 1 and 72are both dose to 1, then the estimate 
remains  sparse for a relatively  large  K  but will  become 
dense eventually. If 7 1 and  72 are both close to 0, then the 
estimate is dense for even a very small K.  With nonzero 
7 1 and 72 , the model with small to moderate K usually has 
a small number of clusters and a small number of genes 
within each selected cluster. 
Tuning parameter selection 
Since the  characteristics of the  CTGDR  estimates are 
determined by the three tuning parameters, K,  7 1 ,  and  7 2 , 
the selection of these parameters should be well defined. 
Ma  and  Huang  (2007)  defined  the  cross-validated 
objective  function,  CV(k),  having  chosen  the  tuning 
parameter Kthat maximizes  CV( k)  for any fixed ( 71'  7 2 ), 
and obtained model features for different 7 1 and 7 2 • Then, 
the parsimonious model with relatively large CV score has 
been chosen. 

Results 
Carcinoma of the  lung  has been  the  leading  cause  of 
cancer death in the United States and worldwide. Human 
lung  carcinomas  were  classified  by  mRNA expression 
profiling, and distinct adenocarcinoma subclasses were 
revealed  by  Bhattacha~ee et  a/.  (2001 ).  Hierarchical 
clustering  was  applied  to  recapitulate  the  distinctions 
between established historical classes of lung tumors and 
adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, the relationship between 
gene expression tumor classes and the survival times has 
been studied.  However,  it is very challenging to identify 
genes  that  have  significant  effects  on  survival  time 
because of a large number of genes and relatively small 
sample sizes. To select significant variables from a large 
number of variables (e.g., genes) effectively, many methods 
have  been  developed,  including  LASSO  and  other 
regularization methods. We apply these methods to our data 
set in ader to identify the significant genes for lung carcinorras. 
A total  of 203  snap-frozen  lung  tumors  (n=186)  and 
normal  lung  (n=17)  specimens were  sampled.  The  203 
specimens  include  histologically-defined  lung, adenocar(cid:173)
cinomas (n=127), squamous celllungcarcinomas (n=21), 
pulmonary carcinoids (n=20), small-cell lung cancer (n=6) 
cases,  and  normal  lung  (n=17)  specimens.  Other 
adenocarcinomas (n=12) were suspected to be extra pul(cid:173)
monary  metastases  based  on  clinical  history.  Using 
oligonucleotides, mRNA expression levels corresponding 
to 12,600 transcript sequences were analyzed from 186 
lung  tumor  samples,  including  139  adenocarcinomas 
resected from the lung. Among 12,600 transcript sequences, 
the 3312 most variable transcript sequences were selected 
by using a standard deviation threshold of 50 expression 

units. Only 125 adenocarcinoma samples were used for 
analysis due to availability of clinical  data,  such  as the 
survival time. Genes were also standardized to have zero 
mean and unit variance. Applying the gap statistics, the 
number of clusters was selected as 15 (K-means) and 25 
(Hierarchical),  respectively,  as shown in  Fig.  1. 

We obtained the result of model features with cross(cid:173)

validation-selected tuning parameters. As shown in Table 
1, we compare the four methods, including two different 
CTGDR methods depending on the clustering methods. 
The TGDR method selects the largest number of genes 
while the LASSO method selects the smallest number of 
genes.  The  two  different  CTGDR  methods  select  the 
similar number of genes. The whole list of genes selected 
by the four methods can be given on request. 

Since a list of genes selected by four methods is not 
perfectly  matched  across  methods,  it  is  desirable  to 
compare which genes are selected from all methods and 
how similar the selected genes are across methods. Table

An Application of CTGDR Method for Selecting Genes in Predicting the Survival Time  99 

2 displays a list ofgenes that are selected by more than two 
methods. Comparing the selected genes shown in Table 
2, TGDR includes most of the genes selected by the other 
methods, while all of the genes selected by LASSO are 
included  in  those  by  TGDR,  but  only  three  genes 
overlapped  with  those  selected  by  K-means  CTGDR. 
Comparing  the  two  different CTGDR  methods,  the  12 
genes selected by K-means CTGDR are the same as those 
selected by the TGDR method, while only 5 genes selected 
by hierarchical CTGDR are the same as those selected by 
the  TGDR  method.  Only  four  of the  same  genes  are 
selected by both the K-means and hierarchical CTGDR 
methods.  From these results, TGDR includes almost all 
genes  selected  by  both  the  K-means  and  hierarchical 
CTDGR methods. This result implies that the selection of 
genes depends on the clustering information as well as the 
clustering methods. We can make a statistical inference 
about the association of genes with survival time from a 
list of genes selected across methods. For example, it is 
suspected  that the  seven  genes selected  by the  three 
methods as displayed in Table 2would be more strongly 
associated with survival time. Although TGDR and LASSO 
are effective regularization methods for variable selection, 
they  do  not  consider  cluster  structures,  whereas  two 
different CTGDR methods incorporate cluster structures 
into TGDR-based variable selection.  However,  the two 
CTGDR  methods  select  genes  rather  independently 
except  for  four  overlapping  genes.  Moreover,  when

comparing the estimated coefficients of genes, the LASSO 
yields smaller values of the estimated coefficients than the 
other three methods. From the results in Table 2, it is not 
easy  to  know  which  method  is  the  best  for  variable 
selection. 

Evaluation 
To evaluate the prediction performance, ·we use the cross(cid:173)
validation-based approach, as suggested in Ma and Huang 
(2007),  as follows: 

First, we partition the data randomly into a training set 
of size n 1  and a test set of size n 2 ,  with  n 1 +n2  =  n  Then 
we compute the CTGDR estimates based on the training 
set only and compute a prediction index for the testing set 
using the training set estimates. To overcome the possibility 
of extreme prediction performance, repeat this process B 
(e.g., 100) times. For the censored survival data, we create 
two risk groups by dividing the testing set by a median risk 
score of the estimated linear risk scores {3Z.  The estimates 
of regression coefficients of the selected genes are partly 
shown in Table 2. Then we compute the log-rank statistic 
for  testing  the  equivalence  of  two  survival  curves  of 
different  risk  groups.  After  repeating  this  procedure  B 
times, we take the average of the log-rank statistics. If this 
value  of the  log-rank statistic is  large,  thenthe  two  risk 
groups are well separated, which implies that the prediction 
of the CTGDR estimates performs satisfactorily. 

Alternatively, as suggested by a referee, we compute 
the different median risk score, which is obtained from the 
significant genes from the fitted Cox model in which only 
the  selected  genes  are  considered.  In  other words,  the 
methods are eva I uated with the risk scores of the different 
estimates from those shown in Table 2, which are displayed 
in Table 3. For example, for the LASSO method, the Cox 
model  is  fitted  with  six  selected  genes  but  only  four 
significant  genes  of  the  six  genes  are  involved  in 
calculating  the  risk  score  and  the  log-rank statistic for 
testing the equivalence of the two risk groups. 

Comparing the results of Table 2 and Table 3, only a 
few  genes  are  overlapped  within  the  two  Tables.  In 
addition, the estimates shown in Table 3 are much larger 
than those in Table 2, though the signs of the estimates 
are unchanged. 

For  the  comparison  of  methods,  we  evaluate  the 
prediction performance of methods using the two different 
log-rank statistics based on the 3-fold cross-validation with 
8=1 00 and 200 random partitions, respectively. As shown 
in Table 4, none of the methods provides the significant 
separation of the  high- and  low-risk groups by log-rank 
statistic calculated by the risk score from the estimates of 
each  method,  since the average values of the  log-rank 
statistics are not large enough to be significant for testing

performance than TGDR, even though these methods use 
more information about clustering structures than TGDR. 
According  to  the  results  shown  in  Table  4,  the  TGDR 
method performs better than the K-means and hierarchical 
CTGDR,  while  the  LASSO  method  has  slightly  better 
predictive value than  the  hierarchical  CTGDR method. 
However, the results from Table 4 can not be generalized 
because  tuning  parameter  values  and  the  number  of 
clusters are not chosen over a variety of choices. For the 
generality  of  results,  more  performance  should  be 
implemented by considering a variety of parameters that 
can affect variable selection as well as evaluation of the 
performance. 

Discussion 
In this paper, we review four method~SSO, TGDR 
and two different CTGDR-to investigate which genes are 
significantly  predictive  of survival  time  using  the  Cox 
model. Since there is a large number of genes available, 
it is not easy to select susceptible genes for relatively small 
sample sizes.  The LASSO method  shrinks coefficients 
and  produces  some  coefficients  that  are  exactly zero, 
which identifies a small number of important genes. The 
TGDR method is also effective for variable selection using 
path information. However, these two methods do not use 
cluster  structure,  whereas  the  CTGDR  method  takes 
advantage of clustering structures. 

Comparison of the four methods using an example of 
lung tumor data  showed that the two different CTGDR 
methods yield more compact gene selection than TGDR, 
which includes almost all genes selected by two CTGDR 
methods, whereas LASSO provides a smaller subset of 
genes than other methods. Since the selected genes are 
not consistent for each method, it is difficult to determine 
which method provides the best selection of genes. The 
performance  of  methods  is  evaluated  using  3-fold 
cross-validation based on two log-rank statistics. One of 
them is calculated using the risk score from the estimates 
of selected genes, while the other is calculated using the 
risk score from the estimates of the significant genes from 
the fitted Cox model. None of the methods provides any 
significant  result  in  separating  the  high- and  low-risk 
groups by the first log-rank statistic, whereas all methods 
yield significant results in separating the two risk groups 
with the second log-rank statistic. This is due to differences 
in the estimates of the coefficients depending on whether 
regularization is involved in the estimation process or not. 
The estimates for the Cox model are obtained without any 
regularized  penalty,  whereas the regularized  estimates 
are obtained by using penalty to be selected from a large 
number of genes. Therefore, it seems to be more desirable 

An Application of CTGDR Method for Selecting Genes in Predicting the Survival Time  101 

to estimate the effects of genes in the Cox model once the 
significant genes are selected using some regularization 
methods. 

In addition, it would be more profitable to evaluate the 
methods by choosing from a variety of choices of tuning 
parameters,  the  number  of clusters,  and  the  validation 
statistics. Since the performance also depends on clustering 
information, it may be critical which information can be used 
for CTGDR. For example, if there are well-defined biological 
pathways, the proposed CTGDR method can makeuse of 
that information to select susceptible genes. Therefore, it 
would  be  desirable  to  extend  this  method  with  more 
information of pathways in future studies.
