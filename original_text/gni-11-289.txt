Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the leading cause of cancer mortality among women worldwide. The molecular 
understanding of HPV proteins has significant connotation for understanding their intrusion in the host and designing novel 
protein  vaccines  and  anti-viral  agents,  etc.  Genomic,  proteomic,  structural,  and  disease-related  information  on  HPV  is 
available on the web; yet, with trivial annotations and more so, it is not well customized for data analysis, host-pathogen 
interaction, strain-disease association, drug designing, and sequence analysis, etc. We attempted to design an online reserve 
with comprehensive information on HPV for the end users desiring the same. The Human Papillomavirus Proteome Database 
(hpvPDB)  domiciles  proteomic  and  genomic  information  on  150  HPV  strains  sequenced  to  date.  Simultaneous  easy 
expandability and retrieval of the strain-specific data, with a provision for sequence analysis and exploration potential of 
predicted structures, and easy access for curation and annotation through a range of search options at one platform are a 
few of its important features. Affluent information in this reserve could be of help for researchers involved in structural 
virology, cancer research, drug discovery, and vaccine design.

Introduction

Human papillomavirus (HPV), a virus from the papillo-
mavirus family, is capable of infecting humans. About 200 
different strains of HPV identified, based on DNA homology, 
have been found to be etiologically linked to cervical, vaginal, 
vulvar, penile, anal, oral, and plantar infectious lesions and 
cancers, as well [1, 2]. The HPV genome, a double-stranded 
DNA  molecule,  consists  of  8  kilobase  pairs  (kbp)  of 
nucleotides, which comprises 3 regions: 6 early open reading 
frames (ORFs)－E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7; 2 late ORFs－
L1 and L2; and an upstream regulatory region [3]. A consi-
derable volume of HPV specific information pertaining to its 
genome,  proteome,  structure,  and  disease  association  is 
available  scattered  on  the  web  with  trivial  annotations; 
however, it is not customized to explore for data analysis, 

host-pathogen interaction, strain-disease association, drug 
designing, and sequence analysis, etc. Therefore, we pro-
posed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  reserve  on  HPV  with 
maximum possible inputs and outputs for the end users.

Methods and Results
Data retrieval and curation

Amongst the existing 200 strains of HPV, 150 have been 
sequenced as of now, and their data available at the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Genome and 
proteome information of those viral strains was retrieved 
from NCBI. Besides PubMed, various other online resources 
and published literature were also explored for validating 
genomic, proteomic, as well as strain and disease-associated 
information on HPV strains. HPV strain-specific informa-

tion,  such  as  strain  name,  sequencing  status,  sequencing 
centre, NCBI accession ID, associated disease information 
with references, genome statistics (GC%, AT%, A, T, G, C 
count, genes, and proteins), etc., were curated from various 
online resources, and protein parameters (length, molecular 
weight,  isoelectric  point)  were  calculated  using  ExPASy 
ProtParam [4]. 

Protein structure prediction and validation

MODELLER9v10 [5] and the SWISS-MODEL [6] server 
were used for protein structure prediction. The stereoche-
mistry of each protein was evaluated through PROCHECK 
[7] analysis, available at the RCSB validation server (http:// 
deposit.rcsb.org/validate/), and validated using ProSA-web 
[8] (http://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php).

Reserve architecture and design

Human  Papillomavirus  Proteome  Database  (hpvPDB), 
the relational reserve, was developed using Microsoft SQL 
Server 2005 as the  back  end.  The website  is  powered by 
XAMPP (Windows Version 1.7.3). HTML, JavaScript, and 
CGI-PERL-based web interfaces were employed to execute 
SQL queries. The curated data and related information were 
stored in tables. The application layer, the web interface, and 
the  backend  relational  tables  were  integrated  using  CGI- 
PERL. The overall architecture of hpvPDB is shown in Fig. 1.

Reserve features

hpvPDB interfaces are made to help the users for easy 
navigation and information retrieval. Home, About, Tools, 
Search, and Advanced Search interfaces can be explored to 
obtain  strain-  and  protein-specific  information.  User  can 
access the meta information about different strains using a 
search box. Reserve comprises the strain-specific detailed 
informationon  its  name,  sequencing  status,  submission 
details,  date  of  submission,  NCBI  IDs,  disease  types  and 
subtypes, type of DNA, genome length, molecular weight, 
nucleotide composition (A, T, G, C, AT, GC content), number 
of genes and proteins, and protein list. A genome map of 
each strain obtained by Geneious 5.4.4 software (available 
from http://www.geneious.com/) is also integrated in this 
page. Users, through an advanced search option, can pre-
cisely access the Genome and Proteome information sepa-
rately  by  selecting  HPV  genome  or  HPV  proteome.  Each 
protein  entry  comprises  protein  overview  (name,  locus, 
function, etc.), protein sequence information (amino acid 
sequences with NCBI accession number with provision for 
direct protein BLAST [9] against NCBI nr database), protein 
parameters (length, molecular weight, theoretical isoelectric 
point [pI], amino acid composition, etc.), protein structure 
(predicted 3D structure by homology modeling viewed by 
Jmol (available from http://www.jmol.org/) [10] with the 
JAVA platform, Ramachandran plot obtained by PROCHECK 
and  Z-score  and  Energy  plot  obtained  by  ProSA-Web. 
hpvPDB platform also provides a phylogeny analysis tool to 
perform multiple sequence alignment  and phylogenetic tree 
construction  of  selected  HPV  proteins  using  the  Phylo-
geny.fr web service [11].

The  original  Human  Papillomaviruses  Database  was 
developed and hosted by the Los Alamos National Labo-
ratory (LANL) between 1994 and 1999 with funding from 
the  National  Institute  of  Allergy  and  Infectious  Diseases 
(NIAID)  [12].  ‘Human  Papillomaviruses:  A  Compilation 
and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences’ 
contains  four  annual  data  books  of  papillomavirus  infor-
mation published in both paper and electronic form (1994, 
1995, 1996, and 1997) but has not been updated since 1997 
[12]. This contains nucleotide sequences of few HPV strains 
and  other  papillomaviruses,  amino  acid  and  nucleotide 
sequence alignments, analysis, related host sequences, and 
database  communication.  We  did  not  find  any  structural 
information in that database. In hpvPDB, along with updated 
protein sequence information, genome and protein structure 
information is also provided.

Conclusion

hpvPDB brings together comprehensive information on a 
total of 1,036 protein sequences and 743 predicted struc-
tures. The outcome of this study might provide a platform 
for simultaneous structural comparative analysis of these 
proteins and help in finding out variations in their structures 
to  explore  why  different  strains  of  HPV  have  causative 
associations  with  different  types  of  cancers.  Further,  this 
might  also  help  in  designing  specific  drugs  or  vaccines 
against  specific  strains  of  HPV.  This  reserve  provides  a 
resource to help virologists identify potential roles for viral 
protein. Currently the hpvPDB is updated manually through 
online resources and available scientific publication review; 
however, to sustain the quality, these data are analyzed and 
checked before incorporation into this reserve. Meanwhile, 
to  provide  regular  updates,  our  team  is  committed  to 
searching for newly sequenced HPV strains, updating this 
reserve, and serving the users.
