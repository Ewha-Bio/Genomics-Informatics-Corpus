The advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies have enabled the generation of global proteome data 
from tissue or body fluid samples collected from a broad spectrum of human diseases. Comparative proteomic analysis of 
global proteome data identifies and prioritizes the proteins showing altered abundances, called differentially expressed 
proteins (DEPs), in disease samples, compared to control samples. Protein biomarker candidates that can serve as indicators 
of disease states are then selected as key molecules among these proteins. Recently, it has been addressed that cellular 
pathways can provide better indications of disease states than individual molecules and also network analysis of the DEPs 
enables effective identification of cellular pathways altered in disease conditions and key molecules representing the altered 
cellular  pathways.  Accordingly,  a  number  of  network-based  approaches  to  identify  disease-related  pathways  and 
representative molecules of such pathways have been developed. In this review, we summarize analytical platforms for 
network-based protein biomarker discovery and key components in the platforms.

Introduction

For a last decade, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic 
technologies have emerged as a core technology to measure 
protein  expression  and  the  sites  with  post-translational 
modifications (PTMs) on large scales. However, MS-based 
proteome  analysis  has  been  possible  for  only  a  limited 
number of proteins and also limited in accurately detecting 
low abundant proteins and the peptides with low abundant 
PTMs  [1-4].  Recent  advances  in  high-resolution  peptide 
separation, comprehensive fractionation, and high perfor-
mance  MS  considerably  improved  the  proteome  size  and 
depth (increased numbers of proteins and PTM sites meas-
ured) and also the accuracy in quantitative information of 
proteomic data (abundances of proteins and PTM sites) [5]. 
Moreover,  MS-based  proteome  analysis  required  large 
amounts of samples to measure reliably proteins and PTM 
sites.  To  resolve  this  problem,  the  methods  for  serial 
enrichments of different PTMs from the same sample have 
been developed to significantly reduce the sample amount 
required [6]. These advanced MS-based proteomic techno-
logies have facilitated the generation of proteome and PTM 
profiles  in  tissue  and  body  fluid  (plasma/serum,  urine, 

ascites, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, saliva, and tear) 
samples collected from the patients with a broad spectrum of 
human diseases.

Comparative  proteomic  analysis  of  samples  from  the 
patients and healthy control subjects is commonly applied to 
identify  protein  biomarker  candidates  [7-10].  In  this 
analysis, proteome profiles are first obtained for tissue or 
body fluid samples collected from the patients with a target 
disease and also healthy subjects, and the proteins showing 
altered abundances, called differentially expressed proteins 
(DEPs), in disease samples, compared to control samples are 
then  identified  (discovery  phase)  [10].  In  the  protein 
biomarker  discovery  platforms,  about  hundred  DEPs  are 
selected as an initial set of biomarker candidates, and their 
altered expression are then verified in a small cohort of the 
patients, which is independent to the patients used in the 
discovery  phase  (verification  phase)  [5].  However,  the 
number of DEPs is often larger than 100, and how to select 
the initial set of biomarker candidates is not straightforward, 
although fold-changes and/or associations of the DEPs with 
pathophysiological  processes  in  the  target  disease  can  be 
used as the criteria for selection of the initial set of biomarker 
candidates. Next, for the initial candidates whose disease-

related alterations in their abundances were confirmed in the 
small cohort during the verification phase, their validity as 
biomarkers  is  tested  in  a  large  cohort  of  the  patients 
(validation  phase)  [5].  Finally,  the  biomarker  candidates 
whose altered expression was confirmed in the large cohort 
are selected as the final set of biomarkers.

Recently, a number of studies have reported that cellular 
pathways can serve as better indicators of disease states than 
individual molecules [11-17]. Pathway enrichment analysis 
provides a list of cellular pathways enriched by the DEPs, and 
a  set  of  cellular  pathways  related  to  pathophysiological 
processes can be then selected as altered cellular pathways in 
the target disease. Next, we can focus on a subset of DEPs 
that are involved in the selected cellular pathways. Further-
more,  network  analysis  for  this  subset  of  DEPs  enables 
effective identification of key molecules that represent the 
selected cellular pathways as protein biomarker candidates. 
Using this approach, an initial set of biomarker candidates 
can  be  selected  more  effectively  than  the  conventional 
criteria, such as fold-changes and associations of the DEPs 
with the target disease. Thus, several network-based approa-
ches  to  identify  disease-related  cellular  pathways  and 
representative  proteins  of  such  pathways  have  been 
developed.  In  this  review,  we  summarize  bioinformatics 
methods for network-based protein biomarker discovery and 
also key components in these network-based methods.

Results
Peptide and protein identification

After obtaining proteomic data from tissue or body fluid 
liquid  chromatography–tandem  mass 
samples  using 
spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS)  analysis,  the  tandem  mass 
spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra are first searched against a 
protein sequence database (e.g., SWISS-Prot or UniProt) to 
identify the peptide sequences for individual MS/MS spectra 
(peptide/protein identification) (Fig. 1). The detected prot-
eome  size  determines  the  depth  to  understand  disease- 
related cellular networks based on the proteome data. Thus, 
a sufficient size of the detected proteome is a prerequisite in 
effective discovery of protein biomarkers based on disease- 
related  networks.  To  ensure  an  adequate  proteome  size, 
accurate identification of the peptides for MS/MS spectra is 
important through database search using the engine, such as 
Mascot  [18],  SEQUEST  [19],  MS-GF＋ [20],  or  Paragon 
(Table 1) [21]. During the database search, a score is assigned 
by the search engine to each peptide that can be generated 
from the sequence database, which reflects the degree of the 
agreement  of  the  measured  MS/MS  spectrum  to  the 
theoretical spectrum of the peptide. For example, SEQUEST 
assigns the scores of X-corr, deltaCorr, SPrank, and SP value to 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

the peptide, whereas MS-GF＋ assigns –log10(E-value) to the 
peptide. For each measured MS/MS spectrum, the peptide 
with the largest score value is then selected, which defines a

peptide-spectrum match (PSM).

Next,  the  statistical  significance  of  the  PSMs  resulted 
from  the  database  search  is  evaluated  using  a  statistical 
method, such as PeptideProphet [22] in the Trans-Proteomic 
Pipeline [23] or the target-decoy method (Table 1) [24]. For 
example, for each PSM, PeptideProphet combines the scores 
(X-corr, deltaCorr, SPrank, and SP value) to an F score, and 
a mixture of Gaussian and Gamma distributions is fitted to 
the distribution of F scores for all PSMs. Using the mixture 
distribution,  the  probability  of  a  PSM  being  true  (Pepti-

deProphet p-value) is estimated [25]. Finally, the PSMs with 
PeptideProphet p-value ＞ 0.95 are selected as the correct 
PSMs.  In  the  target-decoy  method,  a  reverse  sequence 
database was generated by inversing the reference protein 
sequence in the database and then included in the database 
prior to the database search. Using the score values for the 
PSMs in which the peptide sequence was obtained from the 
reverse sequence database, false discovery rates (FDRs) 
for all PSMs are estimated [24]. Finally, the PSMs with 
FDR ＜ 0.01 are selected as the correct PSMs.

Recent studies have shown that the best coverage of the 
detected  proteome  can  be  obtained  by  combining  the 
outputs from multiple search engines. For example, Compid 
enables the integration of Paragon and Mascot (Table 1) [24] 
by assigning the peptides with higher scores from the two 
search engines to the MS/MS spectra, which can leads to 
unreliable false positive rates. Also, MSblender integrates 
the search scores from the search engines into a probability 
score for every possible PSM and then estimates FDRs for 
the PSMs in a reliable manner [26]. This method identifies 
more PSMs than any single search engine at the same FDR. 
After identifying all the PSMs from the database search, a list 
of  the  detected  proteins  are  further  identified.  Using  the 
SEQUEST search outputs, the probability that a protein is 
correctly identified (ProteinProphet p-value) is calculated by 
statistically combining the PeptideProphet p-values of the 
peptides  derived  from  the  protein,  and  the  proteins  with 
PeptideProphet p-value ＞ 0.99 are selected as the proteins 
correctly identified [22]. In the target decoy method, the 
proteins with more than two non-redundant peptides with 
FDR ＜ 0.01 can be considered as the reliable proteins [27].

Protein quantitation

Several  LC-MS/MS  approaches  provide  quantitative 
information  of  the  peptides  identified  from  the  database 
search  (protein  quantification)  (Fig.  1).  First,  prior  to 
LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptides can be labeled using the 
isotopic agents, such as isotope-coded affinity tag (iCAT) 
[28],  isobaric  tag  for  relative  and  absolute  quantitation 
(iTRAQ) [29], or tandem mass tags (TMT) [30]. For the 
iCAT  data,  the  abundance  of  an  identified  peptide  is 
estimated as the area under the elusion curve of the peptide. 
On the other hand, for the iTRAQ or TMT data, the peptide 
abundance is estimated as the intensities of the reporter ions 
in the MS/MS data [31]. Second, when no isotope labeling 
was done, called label-free LC-MS/MS analysis, the peptide 
abundance is estimated as the area under the elusion curve of 
the peptide as done for the iCAT data. Next, the relative 
abundance of an identified peptide is calculated as the ratio 
of  the  peptide  abundances  between  patient  and  control 
samples. From the iCAT data, the ratios of the heavy and 
light  peptides  are  calculated  as  the  relative  peptide 
abundance. To estimate the relative abundances of a protein, 
a list of the peptides derived from the proteins are identified 
and  the  relative  abundances  of  these  peptides  are  then 
combined using a method for protein quantitation, such as 
the quantification tool in MaxQuant software [32] or a linear 
programming method [33]. 

Identification of differentially expressed proteins

The biomarkers should reflect the alteration of disease-

related pathophysiological processes in the patient samples, 
compared to controls. Thus, the DEPs between control and 
patient samples are identified as the biomarker candidates 
(identification  of  DEPs)  (Fig.  1).  A  number  of  statistical 
methods have been developed for identification of the DEPs, 
such as t-test [34] or integrative statistical methods [35, 36],

of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). Three types of functional
enrichment  analyses  are  shown.  The  output  from  gene  set  enri-
chment  analysis  (GSEA)  is  displayed  as  an  example.  Also,  an 
example  of  network  model  is  shown,  which  includes  functional

death,  respectively).  Node  colors  in  the  network  model  represent

with  the  multiple  comparison  correction.  These  methods 
compare the relative protein abundances between control 
and  patient  samples  and  then  estimate  the  significance 
(p-value or FDR) of the difference in the relative protein 
abundances between control and patient samples methods. 
The proteins with p-value or FDR ＜ 0.01 or 0.05 are then 
selected as the DEPs. Furthermore, additional constraints 
are used to select more reliable DEPs. For example, for each 
DEP, the number of the patients showing the fold-changes 
larger than a cutoff (1.5- or 2-fold) is counted, and a subset 
of DEPs with the number of patients larger than a certain 
percentage  (50%  of  the  patients)  can  be  selected  as  the 
reliable DEPs [37]. Using this criterion, we can focus on the 
DEPs  that  are  likely  to  show  their  alterations  in  the 
abundance in at least more than half of the patients when 
they were used as biomarker candidates for newly collected 
patient samples.

Functional enrichment analysis

The  alterations  in  protein  abundances  under  disease 
conditions  reflect  simple  clinical  symptoms  that  are 
commonly  observed  in  many  other  diseases,  such  as 
inflammation or immune responses, or the alterations of the 
pathophysiological processes specific to the target disease, 
such as aggregation of toxic proteins in neurodegenerative 
diseases.  Thus,  the  DEPs  that  are  involved  in  the 
disease-related pathophysiological processes can represent 
more effectively the alterations specific to the target disease 
(Fig.  2).  To  effectively  understand  the  pathophysiological 
processes  altered  under  disease  conditions,  functional 
enrichment analysis is often performed for the DEPs using 
diverse  enrichment  tools.  For  example,  the  enrichment 
analysis of gene ontology biological processes (GOBPs) or 
Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG) 
pathways can be applied to the DEPs using DAVID [38] and 
PANTHER [39], and commercial tools, such as MetaCore 
[40]  and  Ingenuity  Pathway  Analysis  (IPA,  QIAGEN 
Redwood  City,  http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity)  (Table 
1).  A  list  of  GOBPs  or  KEGG  pathways  with  enrichment 
p-value  ＜ 0.05  are  selected  as  the  pathophysiological 
processes  or  cellular  pathways  altered  under  disease 
conditions. Of these selected GOBPs and KEGG pathways, a 
subset of the GOBPs related to the target disease is further 
selected  based  on  the  knowledge  of  the  target  disease. 
Finally, a subset of the DEPs that are involved in the selected 
GOBPs or KEGG pathways related to the target disease can 
be  selected  as  an  initial  set  of  biomarker  candidates, 
considering  that  these  DEPs  are  likely  to  be  specifically 
associated with the target disease.

No  enrichment  analysis  mentioned  above  consider 
quantitatively the differences in fold-changes of the DEPs, 

but consider equivalently the DEPs that were selected using 
a fixed cutoff (p-value and/or fold-changes). To remedy this 
problem, several functional class scoring methods have been 
developed,  such  as  gene  set  enrichment  analysis  (GSEA) 
(Table 1, Fig. 2) [41]. In the GSEA, all D-changes, and the 
enrichment of functional modules defined in the database, 
such as the molecular signatures database (MSigDB) (Table 
1),  by  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  ranked  protein  list  is 
statistically  evaluated.  Several  alternative  module-level 
statistics to the conventional  GSEA have been also  used, 
including Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the maxmean 
statistic  [42].  Moreover,  as  an  alternative  enrichment 
analysis,  several  pathway  topology  approaches  have  been 
developed, such as signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) 
[43] and network perturbation amplitude (NPA) (Table 1, 
Fig.  2)  [26].  These  approaches  consider  whether  the 
proteins involved in functional modules defined by GOBP or 
GSEA database (MSigDB) interact with each other in cellular 
networks. In the SPIA, a conventional overrepresentation 
measure, as in GOBP enrichment analysis and a topology 
measure of the pathway are combined to identify functional 
modules in which the DEPs are significantly connected. In 
the NPA, the upper and lower tiers are defined as cellular 
pathways (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway 
activation)  and  target  genes/proteins  regulated  by  the 
pathways in the upper tier, respectively, and positive and 
negative  causal  relationships  are  defined  by  the  links 
between the upper and lower tiers. Then, NPA evaluates the 
causal relationships by quantitatively summarizing whether 
the  expression  changes  of  the  downstream  nodes  are 
consistent  with  pathway  activation,  inactivation,  or  no 
change. These analyses provide a list of functional modules 
significantly altered under disease conditions. Similar to the 
case of the GOBP enrichment analysis, a subset of function 
modules related to the target disease can be identified, and a 
subset of DEPs involved in the identified functional modules 
can be selected as an initial set of biomarker candidates.

Network modeling and analysis

Functional molecules or cellular networks altered under 
disease conditions interact closely with each other to form a 
disease-perturbed  cellular  network.  The  network  model 
enables identification of hub-like molecules that can serve as 
core  indicators  of  the  activities  of  cellular  processes 
described in the network model. Thus, it is important to 
understand  the  disease-perturbed  cellular  network  to 
identify the core indicators as the biomarker candidates. The 
core molecules and their associated cellular pathways have 
been  further  suggested  as  therapeutic  targets  or  the 
biomarker  candidates  that  can  be  used  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy of the treatments (e.g., drug efficacy) for the target

disease.  Hence,  the  network-based  approaches have  been 
employed for protein biomarker discovery. 

The  network-based  approaches  first  reconstruct  a 
disease-perturbed  cellular  network  model  describing  the 
interactions of the DEPs or a subset of the DEPs involved in 
the  selected  GOBPs  related  to  the  target  disease  using 
protein-protein (PPIs), protein-DNA (PDIs), and/or protein- 
metabolite interactions (PMIs) in the following interactome 
databases (Table 1, Fig. 2): (1) PPI databases: human protein 
reference  database  (HPRD)  [44],  biological  general 
repository for interaction datasets (BioGRID) [45], biomo-
lecular interaction network database (BIND) [46], search 
tool for recurring instances of neighbouring genes (STRING) 
[47], and Molecular INTeraction database (MINT) [48]; (2) 
PDI  databases:  EdgeExpressDB  (FANTOM4-EEDB)  [49], 
transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) [50], 
MSigDB [41], MultiNet [51], and MetaCore [40]; and (3) 
PMI database: KEGG pathway database [52]. 

Next, the network model are analyzed to identify network 
modules or clusters each of which includes a set of the nodes 
densely  connected  in  the  network  (Fig.  2).  For  network 
clustering or modularization, a number of methods, such as 
jActiveModules [53], ResponseNet [54], NetWalker [55], 
and clusterMaker [56], have been developed (Table 1). These 
methods can be categorized into two groups. One group, 
such as clusterMaker, searches for the node clusters based on 
the network topology information such that the nodes in the 
same cluster have dense connections,  but  sparse  connec-
tions between the different clusters [56]. The other group, 
such as jActiveModules, uses the quantitative fold-changes 
of the nodes between control and patient samples measured 
by  LC-MS/MS  together  with  the  network  topology 
information. In this group, the node clusters are identified 
such  that  the  nodes  in  the  same  clusters  are  densely 
connected  and  also  show  similar  alteration  patterns  in 
protein abundance [53].

For functional interpretation of the node clusters resulted 
from  network  clustering,  functional  enrichment  analyses 
mentioned above are then performed for the nodes in each 
network  cluster.  Of  the  node  clusters,  prior  to  the 
enrichment  analysis,  we  can  focus  on  the  major  network 
clusters including large numbers of the DEPs. The functional 
enrichment  analysis  then  provide  a  subset  of  the  major 
network clusters whose functions (e.g., GOBPs or KEGG 
pathways) are associated with the disease-related cellular 
processes.  This  subset  can  be  considered  as  potential 
determinants  of  the  disease-perturbed  cellular  network. 
Finally, the hub-like DEP in each major network cluster is 
selected  as  a  biomarker  candidate  that  can  reflect  the 
perturbation  of  the  disease-related  cellular  process 
associated  with  the  network  cluster.  Mitra  et  al.  [57] 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

demonstrated the power of the network-based biomarker 
discovery  approach  in  prediction  of  metastatic  cancers  in 
human breast cancer. They identified network clusters with 
dysregulated expression using SigArSearch and showed that 
the network clusters were more accurate in distinguishing 
metastatic cancers from non-metastatic cancers, compared 
with individual cancer-gene markers.

Integrative analysis of proteomic data with other 
global data

Other global data than proteomic data, such as mRNA 
expression, mutation, DNA methylation, histone modification, 
can  provide  complementary  information  that  enables  to 
select  reliable  biomarker  candidates  when  they  are 
integrated with the proteomic data. The integrative analysis 
of proteomic data with other types of global datasets can be 
categorized into two groups (Fig. 3): (1) the molecular level 
and  (2)  the  network-level  integration  methods  [58].  The 
proteome  data  are  contaminated  with  the  noises  coming 
from  numerous  sources  of  technical  variability  during 
LC-MS/MS experiments and biological variability in patient 
samples during sample collection and preparation [59, 60]. 
The  integration  of  disparate  global  datasets  reduces  the 
artifacts of the noises in selection of the DEPs by enabling us 
to focus on the reliable DEPs showing consistent changes 
between control and patient samples in multiple types of 
global data [58].

In the molecular level integration method, the DEPs that 
show consistent alterations in the other global datasets (e.g., 
mRNA expression data) are searched, assuming that they 
are more reliable indicators of the perturbation of cellular 
processes  under  disease  conditions  (Fig.  3).  Biomarker 
candidates can be then selected from these reliable DEPs. For 
example,  the  DEPs  selected  from  the  tissue  data  can  be 
supported by the consistency in the altered expression of 
their corresponding mRNAs. Also, the DEPs can be further 
supported by the consistency in the changes of copy number 
variations  or  DNA  and/or  histone  methylations  of  the 
corresponding genes. Moreover, the reliability of the DEPs 
selected from the serum proteome data can be supported by 
the  altered  expression  of  their  corresponding  mRNAs  or 
proteins in the tissues from the target organ. Hyung et al. 
[61] demonstrated the value of the integrative analysis of 
serum proteome data with mRNA expression and proteome 
data  obtained  from  the  tissues  in  human  breast  cancers. 
They  selected  the  DEPs  between  the  serum  samples 
collected from sensitive and resistant patients to a combi-
natorial chemotherapy using doxorubicin and docetaxol and 
then further selected the DEPs with altered expression of the 
corresponding  mRNAs  and  proteins  in  the  breast  tissue 
samples.  During  the  validation  of  biomarker  candidates, 
they showed that the DEPs with the consistent alteration in 
the tissues showed higher accuracy in their validation using 
western  blotting  for  a  validation  cohort  of  independent 
serum samples.

Individual  patients  can  show  the  variation  in  altered 
molecules of a cellular pathway though the same pathway is 
consistently perturbed under disease conditions. Given the 

variation, these molecules cannot be selected as DEPs using 
the conventional statistical methods, thereby leading to the 
failure to identify biomarkers that reflect the alteration of 
such  cellular  pathways.  Thus,  it  has  been  addressed  that 
cellular pathways can serve as a more reliable indicator of the 
altered  cellular  processes  under  disease  conditions,  com-
pared  to  individual  molecules  [58].  Different  types  of 
molecules (mRNA/proteins, microRNAs, DNA methylations, 
and  metabolites)  can  represent  distinct  layers  of  cellular 
networks.  Thus,  a  cellular  network  can  be  modeled  in  a 
multi-layered network where each layer can be delineated by 
a distinct type of the molecules. For example, transcriptional 
and  microRNA  regulatory  networks  are  defined  by  inter-
actions of transcription factors and microRNAs, respectively, 
with their target mRNAs. Also, cellular signaling networks 
are defined by protein-protein interactions (kinase- substrate 
interactions), while DNA methylation networks are defined 
by interactions of methyltransferases and demethylases with 
their target DNAs and mRNAs. The integration of multiple 
global datasets for different types of molecules enables us to 
decode the multi-layered cellular networks associated with 
the target disease. A number of the tools have been developed 
to  understand  the  subnetworks  (network  clusters)  of  the 
multi-layered networks whose perturbations are collectively 
indicated by different types of global datasets, including IPA 
(QIAGEN Redwood City, http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity), 
HotNet [62], or SteinerNet (Table 1) [63]. Although these 
tools can be applied for integration of proteomic data with 
other types of global data, they have been used mainly for 
integration of disparate genomic and transcriptomic data. 
Recently, Shi et al. [64] developed NetGestalt that can be 
used  for  integration  of  multi-dimensional  global  datasets 
including proteomic data. For example, using NegGestalt, 
Zhu et al. [65] identified KRAS and AKAP12 subnetworks 
that can play important roles in pathogenesis of colorectal 
cancers by integrating proteomic data with mutation, copy 
number variation, DNA methylation, and mRNA expression 
data  generated  from  colon  tissues  and  cells.  Finally,  the 
hub-like molecules in the subnetworks are selected as key 
indicators of the alterations of the disease-related processes 
associated with the subnetworks. For example, Iliopoulos et 
al.  [66]  identified  a  set  of  the  biomarker  candidates  by 
performing the network- based integration of the proteome 
and microRNA expression data. Also, The Cancer Genome 
Atlas  (TCGA)  research  network  identified  the  notch 
signaling  pathway  as  a  key  molecule  representing  the 
pathogenesis  of  ovarian  cancers  by  integrating  somatic 
mutation,  copy  number  variation,  and  mRNA  expression 
data using HotNet analysis [67].

Discussion

In this review, we summarized a battery of bioinformatics 
analyses  for  network-based  biomarker  discovery  using 
LC-MS/MS  data.  These  analyses  include  peptide/protein 
identification  using  database  search  engines,  peptide/ 
protein  quantification  from  MS  or  MS/MS  data,  identifi-
cation  of  DEPs  using  statistical  methods,  functional 
enrichment analysis of DEPs using diverse enrichment tools, 
and  network  modeling  and  analysis  of  DEPs,  as  well  as 
integrative  analysis  of  disparate  global  datasets  with  the 
LC-MS/MS data. 

Peptide  identification  using  database  search  has  been 
known  as  a  main  challenge.  Of  the  MS/MS  spectra 
measured,  about  half  of  them  are  commonly  mapped  to 
peptide sequences. The inclusion of PTMs in database search 
can  map  the  unidentified  MS/MS  spectra  to  peptide 
sequences.  However,  the  PTM  inclusion  exponentially 
increases the search time and thus it would be practically 
impossible to include the most common five PTMs, phos-
phorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and 
acetylation  in  database  search.  Recently,  although  several 
search  tools,  such  as  MODa  [68],  with  improved  search 
speeds have been developed, there is still significant needs 
for efficient search tools that can include the five common 
PTMs in the search. 

Moreover, protein quantification has been also one of the 
challenges in MS-based proteomic analysis. Relative protein 
abundances  are  estimated  by  combining  the  ratios  of 
abundances of the peptides derived from the protein. The 
same  peptide  sequences  can  be  derived  from  multiple 
proteins due to the redundancy in their sequences, which 
can cause the discrepancy in the ratios of the peptides from 
the same protein between control and patient samples. Also, 
technical and biological variability can add the discrepancy to 
the  peptide  ratios.  Because  of  these  sources  of  the 
discrepancy  in  the  peptide  ratios,  it  has  been  difficult  to 
estimate the relative ratios of protein abundances between 
control  and  patient  samples.  Recently,  although  the 
optimization-based  quantification  tools,  such  as  linear 
programming [33], have been developed, there have been 
significant  needs  for  the  quantification  methods  with 
improved accuracy.

Due  to  the  issue  with  protein  quantification,  identifi-
cation of DEPs can be also erroneous when inaccurate ratios 
of protein abundances exist. Additional criteria, such as the 
number of patients showing fold-changes larger than a cutoff 
(e.g., 1.5-fold), are used to reduce the error (false-positives) 
in identification of DEPs. The error in identification of DEPs 
can further propagate into functional enrichment analysis 
and network modeling and analysis for the DEPs. Finally, the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

integrative analysis of disparate global datasets suffers from 
different  scales  of  fold-changes  and  the  size  of  detected 
molecules  in  the  different  types  of  global  datasets.  For 
example, mRNA fold-changes between control and patient 
samples  can  be  relatively  larger  than  the  fold-changes  of 
protein  abundances,  which  may  cause  the  bias  toward 
mRNA fold-changes during the integration of fold-changes 
of  mRNA  and  protein  abundances.  Also,  differentially 
expressed microRNAs between control and patient samples 
are smaller than the DEPs or mRNAs, which can lead to the 
bias  toward  the  DEPs  or  mRNAs  during  the  integration. 
Various integration strategies have been proposed to reduce 
the intrinsic bias from the differences in the size of disparate 
global datasets. For example, in these methods, mRNA and 
protein abundance ratios are first integrated and the data 
with  small  sizes  are  separately  integrated  to  the  outputs 
from  the  initial  integration  of  mRNA  and  protein  data. 
However,  regarding  the  scale  difference  in  fold-changes, 
there  have  been  the  needs  for  the  algorithms  that  can 
effectively normalize the different scales of fold-changes in 
different datasets.
