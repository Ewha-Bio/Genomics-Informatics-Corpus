In  this  issue,  Dr.  Jong-Il  Kim’s  group  (Seoul  National 
University, Korea) reports gene expression profile data in 
human  dermal  fibroblasts  treated  with  COX  inhibitors. 
Some COX2-selective inhibitors inhibit cellular senescence, 
but other COX2-selective inhibitors and COX2 nonselective 
inhibitors accelerate senescence and aging. The authors tried 
to  figure  out  the  underlying  mechanisms  by  which  COX 
inhibitors modulate senescence in the skin. Dr. Yeun-Jun 

Chung’s group (The Catholic University of Korea) suggests 
that  a  variant  in  RUNX3  is  associated  with  the  risk  of 
ankylosing spondylitis in Koreans. Dr. Mana Oloomi’s group 
(Pasteur Institute of Iran) demonstrates a sporadic phylo-
genic pattern in cytolethal distending toxin-producing Es-
cherichia coli strains.
