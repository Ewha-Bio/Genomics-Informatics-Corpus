Abstract 
Microarray technology enables us to measure the expression 
of tens of thousands of genes simultaneously under various 
experimental  conditions.  Clustering analysis is one of the 
rmst suooessful methods for analyzing microarray data using 
the assurrption that cx:rexpressed genes may be co-regulated. 
It  is  important to extract  meaningful  clusters  from  a long 
unordered  list  of clusters  and  to  evaluate  the  functional 
homogeneity and  heterogeneity of clusters.  Many quality 
measures  for  clustering  results  have  been  suggested  in 
different  conditions.  In  the  present  study,  we  consider 
biological pathways as a collection of biological knowledge 
and used them as a reference for measuring the quality of 
clustering results and functional  homogeneities.  PathTalk 
visualizes and evaluates functional  relationships between 
gene clusters and biological pathways.

Introduction 
Microarray expression data are incessantly accumulated 
with the aid of recent technological advances. It is widely 
believed that biologically meaningful interpretations can 
be extracted from these large-scale data using suitable 
and  well-organized  methods  of  analysis.  Clustering 
analysis is one of the most prominent methods to analyze 
microarray  data.  It  explores  the  internal  structure  of 
complex data by organizing them into meaningful groups 
or gene sets.  Genes of a similar expression profile may 
share  similar  functions;  clustering  a  gene-expression 
profile can be used for tentative assignment of functional 
annotation of the unknown genes based on the functional

annotations  of  the  known  genes  (Eisen  et  a/.,  1998; 
Tamayo et at.,  1999;  Ben-Dar eta/.,  1999;  Sharan and 
Shamir,  2000;  Sharan eta/., 2003) 

In  microarray  data  analysis,  extracting  meaningful 
gene-expression  clusters  is  important  because  the 
following steps often rely on the quality of the clustering 
result.  It  is  also  important  to  measure  the  functional 
homogeneity of the clusters (or gene sets) from the results. 
Quality measures for gene-expression clusters have 
been proposed in a variety of conditions. Assuming that 
the  true  (i.e.,  the  gold  standard)  clustering  solution  is 
known, one can use the Minkowski measure (Sakal,  1977) 
or the Jaccard coefficient to compare the quality of different 
results.  When the true solution is not known, there is no 
best  measure  of the  quality  of the  result.  Some  have 
evaluated  clustering  results  in  terms  of  intra-cluster 
hormgeneity using within-group similarity of gene-expression 
profiles only (Hansen and Jaumard,  1997; Sharan eta/., 
2003;  Yeung  eta/.,  2001 ).  Others evaluated  clustering 
results based on other biological knowledge. Gat-Viks et 
a/.  (2003) suggested a statistical  measure according to 
prior biological knowledge, and Gibbons eta/. proposed 
a way of judging the quality of clustered data by evaluating 
the mutual information between one gene's membership 
in  a  cluster  and  the  attributes  it  possesses,  given  the 
annotation from the Saccharomyces Genome Database 
(Gibbons eta/., 2002). 

Biological pathways are regarded as one of the most 
valuable collections of molecular biological  knowledge, 
providing  key  information  about  the  organization  of 
biological  systems.  Therefore,  it  is  natural  to  consider 
biological pathway information as a valuable resource for 
measuring  the  quality of clusters  and/or the  degree  of 
horrogeneity of a duster. We first created a pa1:1'May-by-pathway 
similarity  matrix  by  calculating  the  co-membership  of 
genes between each pair of pathways. We then created 
a reference pathway map by using a multi-dimensional 
scaling method. This map represents a universal topological 
structure  of genes  and  pathways  independent  of  the 
experimental condition in which a microarray dataset is 
obtained, and hence it can be used as a reliable frame of 
reference to  evaluate  cluster quality and  homogeneity. 
Gene-gene or pathway-pathway association  in  a given 
microarray  experiment  may  differ  from  conditions  to 
conditions.  Mapping  dataset-specific clustering  results 
onto a universal pathway map may help to understand the

underlying context of a microarray experiment. Path Talk 
is  a  web-enabled  software  package  visualizing  the 
reference  pathway map onto which  the  relationship  of 
gene-expression  clusters are  mapped  and  analyzed  in 
terms of clustering quality and homogeneity. 

Methods 
Creating a reference pathway map 
We collected  471  human biological  pathways from the 
ArrayXPath knowledgebase (Chung eta/., 2003; Chung 
eta/., 2004), integrating pathway information from a variety 
of biological resources, including the Kyoto Encyclopedia 
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa eta/., 2004 ), 
GenMAPP (Dahlquist eta/., 2002), BioCarta (http://www. 
biocarta.com),  and  PharGKB  Pathways.  A  pathway 
similarity matrix was created by calculating the following 
equation for each pair of pathways P1  and P2: 

where G1  and G2 are gene sets in the pathways P1  and P2, 
respectively. Since this similarity table is independent of 
individual  experimental  conditions,  it can  be  used  as  a 
reference map to measure clustering results. 

Using the classical  MDS (multi-dimensional scaling) 
algorithm, which minimizes the topological distortion, we 
can visualize a pathway map on 2-dimensional space. We 
also  created  a  network  of the  pathways,  representing 
pathway  cross-talks.  We  defined  the  degree  of  link 
between a pair of pathway as the number of shared genes. 
When two pathways are regarded as linked if they share 
more  than  3  genes,  the  whole  network  produces  92 
connected components, including one giant component of 
size 374,  6 double-ton components,  and 85 singletons. 
Fig.1  shows a pathway cross-talk map on 2-dimensional 
space, where small circles represent a pathway, the color

Fig.  1. Pathway cross-talk. Circles represent pathways, colors of the circles represent the sources of the pathways (red 
for KEGG, yellow for BioCarta, green for GenMAPP and blue for PharmGKB), and the lines joining two pathways represent 
those pathways sharing more than three genes. The two distinct structures in the upper right and in the lower left sides 
of the reference map represent the cytoplasmic and nuclear components, respectively (see method).

of a circle represents the source of the pathways (red for 
KEGG, yellow for BioCarta, green for GenMAPP, and blue 
for  PharmGKB),  and  the  line  joining  two  pathways 
represents that the two pathways share more than 3 genes. 
Interestingly,  the  red  KEGG  circles  seemed  to  be 
separately  clustered  from  the  yellow  BioCarta  circles, 
representing  the  separation  of metabolic and  signaling 
pathways  in  a cellular system.  We  named them  as the 
cytoplasmic and the nuclear components, respectively. 
For  each  given  clustering  result,  we  visualized 

associated pathways on the cross-talk map of Fig.  1. 

Measuring pathway-homogeneity 
In this subsection, we suggest a method to measure the 
homogeneity of a given gene set based on the topology of 
biological pathways. First, for a given gene set G, we define 
PG by a set of pathway p such that pis significantly related 
with  the  gene set  G.  The  Fisher's exact test  is  used  to 
calculate the statistical significance. The pathVvay-homogeneity 
Hom( G) of a gene set G is defined by 

Hom(G) = Hom(P  ) = 

G 

I PG  I (I PG  1-1) I 2 p.~PG 

"sim(p, p') 

1 

We also define the p-value of the measure of a gene set, 
G,  by  the  relative  frequency  of  random  homogeneity 
Hom( G') being bigger than Hom( G). Here the gene set G' 
is taken randomly more than 1 ,000 times, having the same 
size of G. We here recall that a clustering result is a list of 
gene sets. Path Talk provides a table of two indices of each 
gene set for the clustering  result and  hence provides a 
guide to select more informative gene sets for the following 
analysis. We use the average of pathway-homogeneities 
for the measure of clustering quality. 

Outlier problem and dumbbell problem 
In the definition of pathway-homogeneity, the gene space 
was transformed into pathway space. Thus,  it is needed 
to overcome the classical problems in clustering algorithms 
like the outliers and the dumbbell-shaped cluster problem 
in the pathway space. For the outlier problem, we define 
a singletone index S/( G)  of a gene set by the following 
procedure 

1) Define dist(p,  PG)  by 

dist(p,Pc)= 

2:1-sim(p,p') 

I PG  1-1 p',.p.p'ePG 

1 

2) Let p* be the pathway which maximize the dist(p,  PG) 

3) Define S/( G) by 

Sl(G) =  Hom(Pc- {p*}) 

Hom(Pc) 

We define a dumbbell  index 0/(G) of a gene set by the 
following procedure: 

1)  Let P1 *and p·/ be the pathways that maximize dist(p1, 

p2),  where dist(p1,  p2) = 1 - sim(p1,  p2) 

2)  Divide PG into P1  and P2 such thatp is in P1  if dist(p, p1*) 
< dist(p, P2*) and pis in P2  if dist(p, p1*) > dist(p, P2*) 

3)  Define 0/(G) by 

DI(G) =  Hom(~,Pz) =  Cl  ~I -Hom(~)+ I Pz  I Bom(Pz))l I Pc  I 

Hom(Pc) 

Hom(Pc) 

Results and Discussion 
We used a human HeLa cell-cycle dataset containing 2252 
genes. We clustered the gene expression vectors into 10 
clusters for the  evaluation  of the  clustering  result.  This 
clustering result was input to Path Talk. The distribution of 
each cluster is shown in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows a qualitative 
visualization of homogeneities for 10 clusters, and Fig. 3 
shows quantitative pathway-homogeneities and p-values 
of 10 clusters. 

Table  1 and  Figs.  2 and  3 are the example output of 
Path Talk. Any clustering result written in usual tab-delimited 
text file can  be an input of Path Talk. 

Table 2 shows that clusters 1 and 9 have outlier pathVvays. 
The outlier pathways are related to two genes in each cluster. 
Table 2 suggests that it may retum better clustering results 
to split cluster 1 into two sub-clusters with sizes 7 and  10, 
respectively, and cluster 3 into two sub-clusters of sizes 257

Fig.  2. Clusters superimposed on pathway cross-talk reference map.  For the purpose of illustration, we 
highlighted the members of cluster 7 in bright green edges and those of cluster 9 in  purple edges. Both 
clusters demonstrate good clustering of the member genes mapped onto the pathway space. Moreover, 
the two clusters are clearly separated even within the small area of left lower nuclear component composed 
mainly of BioCarta yellow circles.

In  the  present study,  we  developed  PathTalk,  which 
provides  visualization  and  evaluation  of  the  structural 
association among gene-expression clusters and biological 
pathways. Path Talk helps to extract high quality clusters for 
improved further analysis of gene-expression microarray 
data by visualizing the reference pathway map and systematic
