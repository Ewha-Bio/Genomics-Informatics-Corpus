Abstract 

The adsorption of proteins on the surface of glass slides is 
essential for construction of protein chips. Previously, we 
prepared a nickel-coated plate by the spin-coating method 
for immobilization of His-tagged proteins. In order to know 
whether  the  structural  factor  is  responsible  for  the 
immobilization of His-tagged proteins to the nickel-coated 
glass slide, we executed a series of experiments. First we 
purified a His-tagged protein after expressing the vector in 
E.  coli BL21  (DE3). Then we obtained the unfolding curve 
for the His-tagged protein by using guanidine hydrochloride. 
Fractions unfolded were monitored by intemal fluorescence 
spectroscopy. The i1GHzo for unfolding was 2.27 kcal/mol 
± 0.52. Then we tested if unfolded His-tagged proteins can 
be  adsorbed  to  the  nickel-coated  plate,  comparing  with 
Ni2+-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid)  beads.  Whereas  unfolded 
His-tagged proteins were adsorbed to Nf+-NTA beads, they 
did  not  bind  to  the  nickel-coated  plate.  In  conclusion,  a 
structural  factor  is  likely  to  be  an  important  factor  for 
constructing the protein chips, when His-tagged proteins will 
immobilize to the nickel-coated slides.

Introduction 
For the proteomic analysis,  a variety of techniques have 
recently been developed. A high-throughput analysis with 
protein chips is a potent technique to screen target molecules 
in cells or tissues under a given set of physiological conditions. 
Protein chips are microarrays of proteins adsorbed on the 
surface of the  glass  slides  in  order to facilitate the  high-

throughput analysis (Fung et at., 2001 ). In addition, we can 
take advantage of uniquely biological aspects by analyzing 
with protein chips. Predominantly, it is possible to differentially 
display a comprehensive set of proteins in between the control 
and  the  experimental  samples,  so  that we  can  compare 
protein  profiles of the  control  with the target populations. 
Therefore, their applications expand potentially to the area 
of screening for new functional proteins, diagnosis or therapy 
for diseases. Because of these possible applications, the 
protein chips have been highly focused and considered as 
valuable tools. 

For those reasons, the well-developed protein chip has 
apparently been needed. However, the protein chips were 
little  established,  unlike  DNA  chips  (Debouck  and 
Goodfellow, 1999; Ramaswamy and Golub, 2002). When 
compared with the DNA chip fabrication, the protein chip 
construction  is  more  difficult  not  only  because  of  the 
instability of the protein structure retaining its functionality 
but  also  no  amplification  tools  for  protein  like  the 
polymerase chain  reaction  (PCR) for DNA (Fung et at., 
2001). 

To date, a diversity of protein chips were experimentally 
constructed  (Arenkov  et  at.,  2000;  MacBeath  and 
Schreiber, 2000; Zhu et at., 2001 ). Among those chips, it 
is  still  challengeable  to  construct  the  protein  chips  for 
histidine  (His)-tagged  proteins,  because  His-tagged 
proteins can  bind to  bivalent metal  ions.  We  previously 
constructed the nickel-coated glass slide to immobilize the 
His-tagged proteins by using a spin coater. In this study, 
we further determined that a structural factor of His-tagged 
proteins influences on the immobilization of His-tagged 
proteins to the nickel-coated glass slides. 

Materials and Methods 

Expression of His-Tagged WAX 90 Protein: A plant eDNA 
clone encoding the full-length WAX9D lipid transfer protein 
(L TP)  was  expressed  as  a  His-tag  fusion  protein  in 
Escherichia coli BL21  (DE3) and purified by nickel affinity 
chromatography  as  described  previously  (Shin  et  at., 
2006). Briefly, E.  coli cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 7,000 g for 20 min, suspended in a lysis buffer (50 mM 
NaHzP04, 300 mM NaCI, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0), and 
lysed by sonication. Then cell lysate was separated from 

134  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 4(3) 133-136, September 2006 

cell debris by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min. Finally, 
the  His-tagged  fusion  protein  was  separated  by nickel 
affinity column as described in supplier's manual (Invitrogen). 
For purification ofthe His-tag protein, the purified His-tagged 
WAX9D was thrombin-cut and re-purified by nickel affinity 
column chromatography. 

Equilibrium  denaturation:  Equilibrium  denaturation  as  a 
function of guanidium hydrochloride (GdnHCI) concentration 
was monitored by internal protein fluorescence spectroscopy 
using a spectrofluorometer (Shimazu).  Protein samples at 
indicated  concentrations  were  equilibrated  at  various 
concentration of GdnHCI at 20 °C. Then eguilibrium unfolding 
was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy with excitation 
at 280 nm and emission at 310 nm. Nonlinear least-square 
fit  to  the  equilibrium  data  was  executed  by  using  Origin 
software (provided by Microcal) and the following Santoro(cid:173)
Bolen equation (Santoro and Bolen,  1988): 

Xo = {(XN  + a1[GdnHCI])+(Xu + az[GdnHCI]) 
exp[-(~GHzO/RT + m[GdnHCI]/RT)]}/ 
{1  + exp [-(~GHzO/RT + m[GdnHCI]/RT)]} 

where XN and Xu are the intercepts and a1  and az are the 
slopes  of the  baselines  at  low and  high  urea  concen(cid:173)
tration,  respectively.  ~GHzo is the apparent free energy 
difference between the folded and unfolded forms of the 
protein  linearly  extrapolated  to  [GdnHCI]  = 0,  m  is  the 
slope describing the dependence of ~GHzOon [GdnHCI]. 
Preparation of Nickel Coated Slides: The glass slides were 
deaned up by sonication in ethanol and water alternatively 
and then completely dried before coating with nickel ion. 
The cleaned slides were then put on the rotor of the spin 
coater, spread with 0.8 ml of various concentration of NiCiz 
and then spun at various speeds (1000 to 4000 rpm) for 
different time points. Then coated slides were dried on the 
hot plates at various temperatures. 
Protein  Adsorption:  The  FITC-conjugated  His-tagged 
protein (Ko eta/., 2001) was applied to the slides, incubated 
for  0.5h  at  room  temperature,  washed  with  PBS  or 
methanol and dried for fluorescence detection. 
Fluorescence Detection: FITC-conjugated proteins immo(cid:173)
bilized on the glass slide were detected by a Bio-lmaging 
Analyzer System (BAS; Fuji Photo Film Co.) at excitation 
and emission of 490 and 520 nm,  respectively. 
Western Blots: Protein solution ( 1 0 J.!g  each) was resolved 
by  15%  SDS-PAGE,  transferred  to  a  polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore), and probed with 
His-tag antibodies (Ab)  (Cell  Signaling).  Goat anti-rabbit 
lgGs (Santa Cruz) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase 
were  used  as  secondary  Ab's  and  membranes  were 
developed by a chemiluminescent detection method (Park 

eta/., 1998). 

Results and Discussion 
For assessing the immobilization of His-tagged proteins 
to  the  nickel  coated  glass  slides,  the  vector  pET  32a 
encoding a His-tagged protein gene was transformed into 
E.  coli  BL21  (DE3).  Then  the  His-tagged  protein  was 
expressed, thrombin-cut and purified by the nickel-column 
chro-matography. The sequence of the His-tagged protein 
appears in  Fig.  1. 

We were curious whether the unfolding state of His(cid:173)

tagged proteins affects the immobilization of His-tagged 
proteins to the nickel ion-coated glass slides. In order to 
know the  query,  we  examined  the  GdnHCI(guanidium 
hydrochloride)-dependent  unfolding  profile  of the  His(cid:173)
tagged  protein.  First,  we  measured  the  fluorescence 
spectra between 0 M and 8 M GdnHCI. As shown in Fig. 
2, the fluorescence intensity of the His-tagged protein at 
8 M guanidium was higher than at 0 M, indicating that the 
His-tagged protein is likely to be unfolded at 8 M GdnHCI. 
Then, the unfolding kinetics was determined by monitoring

unbound  protein  was  washed  with  PBS  (phosphate  buffered

nickel  ion-coated  glass slide  were  detected  by Western  blots 
and an image analyzer,  respectively. 

folding  process,  the  protein  was  refolded  by  dialysis 
against a refolding buffer. Interestingly, the fluorescence 
spectrum  of the  refolded  protein  was similar to that  of 
protein  (data  not shown),  indicating that the  unfolding/ 
folding processes were reversible. 

The  folding  profile  for  the  His-tagged  protein  was 
generated by replot of fluorescence intensities at various 
concentration of GdnHCI (Fig. 5).  Fitting was performed 
at all three different data sets by using the Santoro-Bolen 
equation  (see  Materials  and  Methods).  The  two-state 
model  (U<--*N)  is possibly applicable to fit the data. The 
fitting generated L'lGH20 as 2.27 kcal/moi±0.52. 

Then we tested immobilization of the His-tagged protein 
to Ni2• ion-coated slide at various guanidium solutions. As

a control,  we also immobilized the  same protein  to the 
Ni2+-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) beads. For immobilization 
to Ni2+ -NTA beads, 2.4 nM His-tagged protein was added 
to 10 ml  NTA beads at 0-8 M GdnHCI, incubated for 1 h 
and washed thoroughly. Then bead-immobilized protein 
was  detected  by  Western  Blots (Fig.  6,  Top  panel).  Of 
interest, the His-tagged protein was immobilized in 0-8 M 
GdnHCI. In comparison, the immobilization ofthe His-tagged 
protein to the nickel coated glass slide was detected at 0 
and  1 M GdnHCI (Fig.  6,  Middle panel).  Of interest, the 
immobilization profile for His-tagged WAX9D was similar 
to that for the His-tagged protein (Fig.  6,  Bottom panel). 
These data indicate that the folding state is likely to greatly 
influence on the immobilization of His-tagged proteins to 
the nickel ion-coated slides,  but not on  NTA beads. 

For His-tagged proteins to immobilize to a solid support, 
Ni2+ ion-chelated imidodiacetic acid (IDA) or nitrilotriacetic 
acid (NTA) have typically been used (Arnold, 1991; Ko et 
a/.,  2001 ).  Previously, we observed that the  His-tagged 
proteins  were  immobilized  to  the  nickel  coated  slides 
prepared with only NiCh in the absence of NTA or IDA 
(Hyun  et at.,  2002).  Although  the  detailed  mechanism 
remains unknown, we found in this study that the glass slide 
coated with only NiCh can not be utilized in experimental 
conditions for unfolded proteins. 

The nickel-coated slides prepared  here by the spin(cid:173)
coating method have many advantages for the protein chip 
fabrication; 1) low cost, 2) simple constructing process, and 
3) more importantly, maintenance of the target domains 
for test proteins during the protein chip fabrication. However, 
to extend its application area, the nickel-coated glass slide 
will be improved to more tightly bind His-tagged proteins 
in extreme biochemical conditions.
