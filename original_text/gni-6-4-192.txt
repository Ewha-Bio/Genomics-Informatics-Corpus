Abstract

Erythropoietin-producing  human  hepatocellular  carcino-
ma  receptor  B1  (EPHB1)  is  a  member  of  the  Eph  family 
of  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  that  mediate  vascular  sys-
tem  development.  Eph  receptor  overexpression  has 
been  observed  in  various  cancers  and  is  related  to  the 
malignant  transformation,  metastasis,  and  differentiation 
of  cancers,  including  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC). 
Eph  receptors  regulate  cell  migration  and  attachment  to 
the  extracellular  matrix  by  modulating  integrin  activity. 
EphrinB1,  the  ligand  of  EPHB1,  has  been  shown  to  reg-
ulate  HCC  carcinogenesis.  Here,  we  sought  to  de-
termine  whether  EPHB1  polymorphisms  are  associated 
with  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)-infected  liver  diseases,  in-
cluding  chronic  liver  disease  (CLD)  and  HCC.  We  geno-
typed  26  EPHB1  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  in  399  Korean  CLD,  HCC,  and  LD  (CLD+HCC) 
cases  and  seroconverted  controls  (HBV  clearance,  CLE) 
using  the  GoldenGate  assay.  Two  SNPs  (rs6793828  and 
rs11717042)  and  1  haplotype  that  were  composed  of 
these  SNPs  were  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for 
CLD,  HCC,  and  LD  (CLD+HCC)  compared  with  CLE. 
Haplotypes  that  could  be  associated  with  HBV-infected 
liver  diseases  by  affecting  downstream  signaling  were 
located  in  the  Eph  tyrosine  kinase  domain  of  EPHB1. 
Therefore,  we  suggest  that  EPHB1  SNPs,  haplotypes, 
and  diplotypes  may  be  genetic  markers  for  the  pro-

Introduction

The  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  is  the  most 
common  genomic  sequence  variation  and  involves  the 
stable  substitution  of  a  single  base  in  the  human 
genome.  It  was  recently  reported  that  various  SNPs  may 
increase  susceptibility  to  risk  factors  for  the  develop-
ment  of  a  variety  of  cancers  (Storey et al.,  1998;  Calin 
et  al.,  2005;  Kiyohara  &  Yoshimasu,  2007;  Dutt  & 
Beroukhim,  2007;  Zeng et al.,  2006).  Moreover,  SNPs  in 
various  genes,  such  as  the  genes  for  cell  division  cycle 
protein  6  (Cdc6)  (Xiong  et al.,  2008),  patched  homolog 
(PTCH)  (Fu et al.,  2008),  interleukin  (IL)-10,  IL-19,  IL-20 
(Truelove  et al.,  2008),  and  Mdm2  p53  binding  protein 
homolog  (MDM2)  (Yoon  et al.,  2008),  are  associated 
with  the  risk  of  developing  HCC.  Consequently,  specific 
SNPs  can  be  used  as  genetic  markers  in  patients  with 
chronic  liver  diseases,  including  chronic  hepatitis  B 
(CHB)  infections,  liver  cirrhosis  (LC),  and  hepatitis  B  vi-
rus  (HBV)-infected  HCC. 
    HCC  is  one  of  the  most  common  malignant  tumors 
worldwide  and  causes  about  1  million  deaths  each  year 
(Parkin et al.,  2001;  Marrero,  2006).  The  etiology  of  HCC 
seems  to  be  multifactorial,  and  several  events  appear  to 
be  necessary  for  malignant  transformation  to  occur. 
Hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  and  HBV  infections  are  im-
portant  risk  factors  for  chronic  liver  diseases  (Collier  & 
Sherman,  1998).  CHB  infection  is  the  most  common  eti-
ology  of  HCC  in  Asian  countries.  In  particular,  cirrhosis 
is  present  in  about  70%  to  80%  of  HCC  cases 
(Velazquez et al.,  2003;  Sy et al.,  2005).  Moreover,  HCC 
is  a  highly  hypervascular  tumor  that  is  associated  with 
a  high  faculty  for  vascular  invasion  (Sun  &  Tang,  2004). 
Because  tumor  angiogenesis  plays  a  critical  role  in  the 
development  and  progression  of  cancers,  including  HCC 
(Sun  &  Tang,  2004;  Pang  &  Poon,  2007),  angiogenic 
factors  have  been  used  not  only  for  diagnosis  and  prog-
nosis  but  also  as  predictors  in  cancer  patients. 

EPHB1  Polymorphisms  are  Associated  with  CLD  and  HCC    193

    Erythropoietin-producing  human  hepatocellular  carci-
noma  (Eph)  receptors  and  ephrins  are  classified  into  the 
Ephrin-A  or  -B  subfamily  according  to  their  structural 
homology  and  binding  specificities.  Eph  receptors  be-
long  to  the  largest  family  of  receptor  tyrosine  kinases, 
which  contain  an  extracellular  ephrin-binding  domain 
and  2  fibronectin  repeats,  a  transmembrane  segment, 
and  a  cytoplasmic  tyrosine  kinase  domain  (Kalo  & 
Pasquale,  1999).  Eph  receptor  signaling  is  even  more 
complex  and  involves  the  downstream  activation  of  Src 
family  kinases.  Eph  receptors  interact  with  many  down-
stream  adaptors, 
including  phosphotyrosine-binding 
adaptor  proteins,  such  as  Nck,  Crk,  Grb2,  and  Grb10 
(Kullander  &  Klein,  2002).  Importantly,  Eph  receptors  and 
ephrins  also  regulate  vascular  development,  tumori-
genesis,  and  metastatic  potential,  as  they  are  related  to 
tumor  growth  and  survival  (Adams  et al.,  1999;  Kojima 
et al.,  2007;  Kim  et al.,  2002).  In  addition,  Eph/ephrin 
overexpression  increases  angiogenesis  and  tumor  vas-
culature  formation  in  many  human  cancers  (Adams  et 
al.,  1999;  Tang  et al.,  1999). 
    EphrinB  ligands  are  transmembrane  proteins  that  bind 
particularly  to  receptors  of  the  EPHB  subclass  (Adams 
et al.,  1999;  Kojima  et al.,  2007).  EphrinB1  is  overex-
pressed  in  HCC,  suggesting  an  important  role  of  the 
Eph/ephrin  system  in  hepatocarcinogenesis  or  tumor 
progression  (Dodelet  &  Pasquale,  2000).  The  ephrinB1  li-
gand  is  known  to  bind  to  the  EPHB1,  EPHB2,  and 
EPHB3  receptors,  and  the  ectodomain  of  EPHB1  in-
duces  corneal  angiogenesis  (Brantley-Sieders  &  Chen, 
2004).  Recent  reports  suggest  that  a  direct  functional 
link  between  EphB/ephrinB  signaling  and  integrins  par-
ticipates  in  angiogenesis  (Brooks  et al.,  1994a).
    Members  of  the  integrin  family  of  cell  adhesion  re-
ceptors  play  fundamental  roles  in  angiogenesis.  In  par-
ticular,  the  integrin  alpha  v  beta  3  is  critical  for  angio-
genesis  and  metastasis  formation  (Brooks et al.,  1994b), 
(Brooks et al.,  1994a;  Kikkawa et al.,  2002)  and  is  sig-
nificantly  upregulated  in  activated  endothelial  cells  dur-
ing  angiogenesis  (Hood  &  Cheresh,  2002).  Some  alpha 
v  integrins,  particularly  alpha  v  beta  3,  are  associated 
with  tumor  progression,  including  that  of  HCC  (Lee  et 
al.,  2008).  Despite  these  various  findings,  no  study  has 
addressed  whether  EPHB1  polymorphisms  are  asso-
ciated  with  HCC.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to 
determine  whether  EPHB1  polymorphisms  are  asso-
ciated  with  susceptibility  to  CLD  or  HCC  from  acute 
hepatitis  in  a  Korean  population.

Methods

Subjects

This  study  included  86  HCC  patients,  206  CLD  patients, 

and  107  HBV  clearance  (CLE)  patient  controls.  All  sub-
jects  were  of  a  genetically  unrelated  Korean  population. 
All  unrelated  blood  samples  that  were  used  in  this  study 
were  obtained  from  the  outpatient  clinic  of  the  Gastro-
enterology  Department  and  from  the  Center  for  Health 
Promotion  of  Ajou  University  Hospital  (Suwon,  South 
Korea).  This  study  was  approved  by  the  institutional  re-
view  board. 
    Patients  were  classified  into  3  groups-according  to 
their  HBV  infection  status,  clinical  data,  and  serological 
profile-as  having  CLE  (spontaneous  recovery  or  HBV 
eradication;  n=107),  CLD  (including  chronic  hepatitis  or 
liver  cirrhosis,  positivity  for  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen 
[HBsAg  (＋)]  for  more  than  6  months,  and  no  hep-
atocellular  carcinoma;  n=206),  or  HCC  (n=86).  Patients 
who  were  positive  for  anti-HCV  or  anti-HIV  antibodies 
were  excluded.  Serological  tests  were  performed  using 
commercially  available  assays  for  HBsAg  and  hepatitis 
B  e  antigen  (HBeAg),  antibodies  against  hepatitis  B  core 
(HBcAb)  and  hepatitis  B  e,  liver  function  tests  for  aspar-
tate  aminotransferase  (AST  or  SGOT),  alanine  amino-
transferase  (ALT  or  SGPT),  alpha-fetoprotein  (AFP),  and 
bilirubin  levels. 

    The  107  CLE  control  patients,  who  were  HBsAg  (−), 

HBcAb  (＋),  and  HBsAb  (＋),  presented  with  acute  hep-
atitis  from  which  they  subsequently  recovered  without 
any  sequelae.  Patients  with  chronic  hepatitis  showed 
elevated  ALT  (≥2  times  the  upper  limit  of  normal)  at 
least  1  time  during  the  follow-up  period  and  were  pos-
itive  for  HBV  DNA,  irrespective  of  HBeAg  positivity. 
Patients  with  liver  cirrhosis  showed  typical  morpho-
logical  findings  on  radiographic  tests  and  corresponding 
laboratory  features  or  evidence  of  portal  hypertension. 
HCC  was  diagnosed  if  subjects  fulfilled  standard  diag-
nostic  criteria:  either  a  serum  AFP  level  ＞400  ng/ml  in 
a  patient  who  was  known  to  have  cirrhosis  with  hepatic 
masses  as  demonstrated  on  either  ultrasonography  or 
CT  and  diagnostic  histology.  The  clinical  characteristics 
of  the  study  subjects  are  summarized  in  Table  1. 

Sample  preparation

Blood  samples  were  stored  at −80oC  until  use.  Geno-

(Intron  Biotechnology 

mic  DNA  was  purified  using  G-DEX  blood  genomic  DNA 
(gDNA)  purification  kits 
Inc., 
SeungNam,  Korea).  The  gDNA  was  quantified  using  the 
Picogreen  dsDNA  quantification  reagent  following  a 
standard  protocol  (Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR,  USA). 
The  plates  were  read  using  a  Victor  TM  3  multilabel 
counter  (PerkinElmer  Inc.  excitation  480  nm,  emission 
520  nm;  PerkinElmer  Inc.,  Waltham,  MA,  USA),  and  a 
standard  curve  for  gDNA  concentration  was  created  us-
ing  known  concentrations  of  lambda  DNA.

SNP  selection  and  genotyping

EPHB1  was  selected  for  further  analysis  based  on  the 
gene  expression  data  that  were  obtained  by  comparing 
adjacent  normal  tissues  and  HCC  samples  with  the 
GenePlorer  TwinChip  Human-8K  human  cDNA  micro-
array  (Digital  Genomics,  Seoul,  Korea).  Validated  SNPs 
in  the  EPHB1  gene  were  selected  from  a  public  SNP 
database  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).  As 
shown  in  Figure  1,  there  were  26  SNPs  located  in  the 
5  exons,  17  introns,  and  4  5’-untranslated  regions 
(UTRs)  and  flanking  regions  of  EPHB1. 
    We  selected  intronic  SNPs,  for  which  genotyping  was 
performed  using  the  GoldenGate  genotyping  assay  kit 
according  to  a  standard  protocol  (Illumina  Inc.,  San 
Diego,  CA,  USA).  Briefly,  250  ng  of  gDNA  was  mixed 
with  oligomers,  and  allele-specific  extension  was  carried 
out  by  ramping  the  temperature  from  70oC  to  30oC  over 
16  h.  Specific  extension  products  were  then  used  in 
polymerase  chain  reactions  (PCRs)  that  consisted  of  34 
cycles  of  35  s  at  95oC,  35  s  at  56oC,  and  2  min  at 
72oC.  PCR  products  were  purified  using  96-well  filter 
plates  (Millipore,  Billerica,  MA,  USA).  For  hybridization, 
all  samples  were  transferred  to  a  384-well  microplate. 
The  SAM  chip  and  purified  PCR  products  were  hybri-
dized  at  60oC  for  30  min  and  then  at  45oC  for  16  h.  The 
SAM  chip  was  then  washed  and  imaged  at  a  resolution 
of  0.8  mm  using  a  BeadArray  Reader  (Illumina).  Geno-
typing  analysis  was  performed  using  BeadStudio  soft-
ware  (Version  3.0.22,  Illumina).  Other  reagents  were  pur-

Statistical  analysis
The  goodness  of  fit  of  the  χ2-test  was  used  to  com-
pare  the  frequencies  between  the  Korean  (CLE)  and 
Northeast  Asian  populations.  Frequencies  of 
the 
Northeast  Asian  population  were  from  the  Chinese  and 
Japanese  HapMap  project  data  (http://hapmap.org).  The 
χ2-test  was  used  to  check  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equili-
brium.  Four  genetic  models  (allele,  additive,  dominant, 
and  recessive)  that  were  proposed  by  Lewis  (Lewis 
2002)  were  assumed  for  the  association  test  between 
the  CLD  and  HCC  groups.  Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD) 
blocks  were  confirmed  by  Haploview  software  (version 

EPHB1  Polymorphisms  are  Associated  with  CLD  and  HCC    195

4.0;  http//www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview)  using  the 
confidence  interval  method.  SNPs  in  the  LD  block  in-
cluded  cases  in  which  the  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF) 
was  ＞0.1  and  in  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p＞0.05). 
Each  individual  haplotype  was  inferred  using  the  SAS 
haplotype  procedure.  Multiple  logistic  regression  models 
were  used  to  calculate  odds  ratios  (ORs),  95%  con-
fidence  intervals,  and  corresponding  p  values  and  to 
control  for  age  and  gender  as  covariables  (Oh  et al., 
2007).  All  statistical  tests  used  SAS  software  (SAS 
Enterprise  Guide  4.1;  SAS  Institute,  Cary,  NC,  USA),  and 
the  significance  level  was  set  at  0.05.

Results

SNP  genotyping,  allele  frequencies,  and  LD 
blocks

The  EPHB1  gene  is  located  on  chromosome  3q21-q23 
and  comprises  16  exons.  We  examined  the  association 
between  SNPs  of  the  EPHB1  gene  and  HBV-infected 
liver  diseases.  BeadStudio  software  (version  2.0)  was 
used  for  genotype  analysis,  and  logistic  regressions 
were  used  for  association  tests.  We  genotyped  a  total 
of  26  polymorphisms  in  EPHB1,  including  3  in  exonic 

regions,  4  in  the  5’-flanking  regions,  and  17  in  intronic 
regions.  Of  the  26  genotyped  SNPs,  13  were  mono-
morphic,  9  were  polymorphic,  and  4  were  nonpoly-
morphic.  The  genotype  distributions  of  all  SNPs  in  the 
CLE  and  CLD  groups  and  all  except  2  SNPs  (rs2291989 
and  rs3772638)  in  the  HCC  group  were  in  Hardy- 
Weinberg  equilibrium  (data  not  shown).  The  locations 
and  reference  SNP  allele  of  the  identified  polymorphic 
sites  are  shown  in  Fig.  1A. 
    The  CLE  control  group  served  as  a  representative  of 
the  Korean  population.  Minor  frequencies  of  the  SNPs  in 
the  CLE  group  were  compared  with  other  Northeast 
Asian  populations,  including  Chinese  (HCB)  and  Japan-
ese  (JPT)  populations,  which  were  genotyped  in  the 
International  HapMap  Project.  All  frequencies,  except 
those  of  2  SNPs  (rs36185  and  rs4955520),  were  similar 
between the Korean and HCB+JPT populations (rs6793828; 
KOR  0.402  HCB+JPT  0.361  p=0.407,  rs11717042;  KOR 
0.383  HCB+JPT  0.350  p=0.496,  Table  2). 
    A  comparison  between  the  LD  blocks  of  the  CLE 
group  of  the  Korean  and  Northeast  Asian  populations 
showed  the  similar  pattern  of  LD  blocks  in  EPHB1  (Figs. 
1,  2).  Moreover,  the  haplotype  frequency  patterns  of 
HCB  and  JPT  appeared  to  be  the  same  as  in  our  data 
(Table  2).

and  recessive  ORs  of  0.411  (95%  CI  0.19∼0.90, 
p=0.027  in  CLE  vs  CLD)  and  0.355  (95%  CI  0.17∼0.73, 
p=0.005  in  CLE  vs  LD;  Table  3). 

EPHB1  haplotypes  are  associated  with  a  risk  for 
HBV-infected  liver  diseases

We  found  3  LD  blocks  among  the  9  polymorphic  SNPs 
in  EPHB1  that  were  constructed  using  the  confidence 
interval  method  (Fig.  1B).  All  of  the  SNPs  in  the  LD 
block  were  tagging  SNPs,  and  each  LD  block  included 
2  SNPs.  Only  the  intronic  regions  of  EPHB1  had  6 
markers  (rs9866494,  rs3732567,  rs2291989,  rs3772638, 
rs6793828,  and  rs11717042)  with  haplotypes  that  were 
displayed.  Two  common  haplotypes  (frequency  ＞0.1)  in 
each  block  were  used  for  further  analysis.  The  hap-
lotype  frequencies  and  association  tests  are  summarized 
in  Table  4.  The  low-frequency  haplotypes  were  excluded 
from  further  analysis  (data  not  shown).  We  identified  a 
significant  association  between  LD  block3  and  the  risk 
for  HBV-infected  liver  diseases,  based  on  its  2  sig-
nificant  SNPs.  Block3  had  3  haplotypes;  in  order  of  de-
creasing  frequency,  they  were  ht  (C-A),  ht  (T-G),  and  ht 
(C-G).  Except  for  the  low-frequency  haplotype  (C-G),  the 
frequencies with which each haplotype was present in the 
CLE,  CLD,  and  HCC  groups  were  estimated  (Table  4). 
    Block3-ht5  (C-A)  showed  a  protective  effect,  with  co-
dominant  ORs  of  1.744  (95%  CI  1.06∼2.88,  p=0.030  in 
CLE  vs  HCC),  1.537  (95%  CI  1.06∼2.22,  p=0.022  in 
CLE  vs  CLD),  and  1.607  (95%  CI  1.13∼2.27,  p=0.008 
in  CLE  vs  LD);  dominant  ORs  of  2.434  (95%  CI  1.11∼
5.34,  p=0.027  in  CLE  vs  HCC)  and  2.817  (95%  CI  1.37
∼5.81,  p=0.005  in  CLE  vs  LD);  and  a  recessive  OR  of 
1.520  (95%  CI  0.97∼2.39,  p=0.070  in  CLE  vs  LD).  In 
contrast,  block3-ht6  (T-G)  showed  a  risk  effect,  with  co-
dominant  ORs  of  0.549  (95%  CI  0.33∼0.91,  p=0.019  in 
CLE  vs  HCC),  0.654  (95%  CI  0.45∼0.94,  p=0.023  in 
CLE  vs  CLD),  and  0.624  (95%  CI  0.44∼0.88,  p=0.007 
in  CLE  vs  LD);  a  dominant  OR  of  0.506  (95%  CI  0.27∼
0.96,  p=0.037  in  CLE  vs  HCC);  and  recessive  ORs  of 
0.435  (95%  CI  0.21∼0.92,  p=0.029  in  CLE  vs  CLD)  and 
0.393 (95% CI 0.20-0.78, p=0.008 in CLE vs LD; Table 4). 

EPHB1  diplotypes  are  associated  with  a  risk  for 
HBV-infected  liver  diseases

EPHB1  diplotypes  were  reconstructed  based  on  the  sig-
nificant  haplotypes  of  LD  block3,  and  their  frequencies 
were  estimated  (Table  5).  Association  tests  of  low-fre-

Association  test  of  EPHB1  SNPs  with  HBV-in-
fected  liver  diseases

With  regard  to  genotypic  association,  we  found  that  2 
SNPs  (rs6793828  and  rs11717042)  were  associated  with 
HBV-infected  liver  diseases.  The  T  allele  of  the  SNP 
rs6793828  was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  liver 
(95%  CI  0.40∼0.94, 
disease,  with  ORs  of  0.610 
p=0.024  in  CLE  vs  HCC),  0.648  (95%  CI  0.46∼0.92, 
p=0.014  in  CLE  vs  CLD),  and  0.637  (95%  CI  0.46∼0.88, 
p=0.007  in  CLE  vs  LD).  The  intronic  SNP  rs6793828 
showed  a  higher  risk  with  the  homozygous  variant  TT 
genotype,  with  codominant  ORs  of  0.549  (95%  CI  0.33
∼0.91,  p=0.019  in  CLE  vs  HCC),  0.636  (95%  CI  0.44∼
0.92,  p=0.015  in  CLE  vs  CLD),  and  0.615  (95%  CI  0.44
∼0.87,  p=0.006  in  CLE  vs  LD);  dominant  ORs  of  0.506 
(95%  CI  0.27∼0.96,  p=0.037  in  CLE  vs  HCC)  and  0.625 
(95%  CI  0.40∼0.99,  p=0.044  in  CLE  vs  LD);  and  re-
cessive  ORs  of  0.435  (95%  CI  0.21∼0.92,  p=0.029  in 
CLE  vs  CLD)  and  0.393  (95%  CI  0.20∼0.78,  p=0.008  in 
CLE  vs  LD;  Table  3). 
    The  G  allele  of  rs11717042  was  associated  with  an 
increased  risk  of  liver  disease,  with  ORs  of  0.623  (95% 
CI  0.40∼0.96,  p=0.032  in  CLE  vs  HCC),  0.669  (95%  CI 
0.47∼0.95,  p=0.024  in  CLE  vs  CLD),  and  0.656  (95% 
CI  0.47∼0.91,  p=0.012  in  CLE  vs  LD).  Also,  the  intronic 
SNP  rs11717042  showed  an  increased  risk  for  the  ho-

Bold  indicates  a  case  in  which  p＜0.05

quency  diplotypes  (＜0.1)  were  skipped.  Diplotypes  of 
the  2  EPHB1  haplotypes  (C-A  and  T-G)  were  associated 
with  HBV-infected  liver  diseases.  The  (C-A/C-A)  dip-
lotype  had  a  more  protective  effect  against  HBV-in-
fected  liver  diseases,  including  CLD  and  HCC,  than  the 
(T-G/T-G)  diplotype.  In  addition,  the  (T-G/T-G)  diplotype 

showed  a  greater  relative  risk  effect  for  HBV-infected 
liver  diseases  than  the  (C-A/C-A)  diplotype  (Table  5).

EPHB1  Polymorphisms  are  Associated  with  CLD  and  HCC    199

phisms  and  haplotypes  of  EPHB1  are  associated  with  a 
risk  for  HBV-infected  liver  diseases  in  a  Korean  popu-
lation.  We  identified  2  significant  SNPs  (rs6793828  and 
rs11717042)  in  LD  block3  of  EPHB1  and  correlated 
them  with  HBV-infected 
liver  diseases.  The  SNPs 
rs6793828  and  rs11717042  were  in  strong  LD  and 
strongly  affected  the  risk  for  HBV-associated  liver  dis-
eases  as  haplotypes.  Moreover,  the  pattern  of  EPHB1 
LD  blocks  in  Korean  population  is  similar  to  those  in 
other  Northeast  Asian  populations.  Our  study  indicates 
that  HBV  infection  is  similar  among  Northeast  Asian 
groups,  including  CHB  and  JPT  populations  (The  Korean 
HapMap  Project  Website  (Kim  et al.,  2008)). 
    The  2  SNPs  in  EPHB1  that  are  associated  with 
HBV-infected  liver  diseases,  including  CLD  and  HCC, 
are  likely  to  be  true  risk  factors  due  to  their  sufficient 
haplotype  and  diplotype  effects  (Table  4,  5).  Carriers  of 
the  ht5  (C-A)  haplotype-containing  variant  alleles  of 
these  SNPs  displayed  protective  effects  (Table  4).  Fur-
thermore,  a  significantly  decreased  risk  also  was  ob-
served  for  the  ht5/ht5  (C-A/C-A)  diplotype.  In  contrast, 
ht6  (T-G)  and  ht5/ht6  (C-A/T-G)  displayed  significant  risk 
effects.  Either  of  the  2  SNPs  (rs6793828  and  rs11717042) 
of  EPHB1  may  be  candidates  for  a  functional  poly-
morphism  that  may  affect  gene  expression  and  cancer 
aggressiveness. 
    Eph  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  initially  were  considered 
to  be  putative  oncogenes,  based  on  their  overexpre-
ssion  in  various  human  cancers,  including  HCC  (Clifford 
et al.,  2008;  Chang  et al.,  2008;  Oshima  et al.,  2008; 
Sawai et al.,  2003).  EPHB1  SNPs  have  been  shown  to 
be  associated  with  cancers,  such  as  esophageal  squ-
amous  cell  carcinoma  (ESCC)  (Ng et al.,  2008;  Hu et al., 
2005;  Lesnick et al.,  2007),  and  previous  studies  identi-
fied  the  association  of  a  significant  SNP,  rs6793828, 
with  Parkinson  disease  (Lesnick  et al.,  2007).  Eph  re-
ceptor  “forward  signaling”  depends  on  the  tyrosine  kin-
ase  domain,  which  mediates  adaptor  protein  phosphor-
ylation  and  Eph  receptor  association  with  various  pro-
teins  (Pasquale,  2008;  Himanen  &  Nikolov,  2003a).  Other 
signaling  proteins  interact  with  Eph  receptors  and  cause 
a  variety  of  cellular  effects,  such  as  cell  adhesion  and 
migration  (Castano  et al.,  2008). 
    EPHB1  is  a  member  of  the  Eph  receptor  family  that 
mediates  vascular  development.  Recently,  the  activation 
of  endogenous  EPHB1  receptors  on  renal  microvascular 
endothelial  cells  by  ephrinB1  was  shown  to  induce  tu-
bule  formation.  EphrinB1  expression  promotes  tumor 
growth  by  initiating  tumor  angiogenesis  in  HCC  (Valenti-
ni  et al.,  2003).  Interestingly,  we  found  that  the  hap-
lotypes  were  located  in  the  Eph  tyrosine  kinase  domain 
of  EPHB1.  The  phosphorylated  tyrosines  of  EPHB1  in-
teract  with  the  Src  homology  2  domains  of  signaling 

molecules  that  are  associated  with  HCC  (Klein  & 
Schneider,  1997;  Yoon et al.,  2001;  Stein et al.,  1998), 
such  as  Src,  growth  factor  receptor-bound  protein  2 
(Grb2),  and  Nck  (Pasquale,  2008;  Himanen  &  Nikolov, 
2003a;  Himanen  &  Nikolov,  2003b).  Thus,  the  LD  region 
that  contains  ht6  (T-G),  including  some  causative  SNPs, 
may  have  synergistic  and  antagonistic  effects  on  various 
downstream  signaling  proteins. 
    We  suggest  that  ht6  (T-G)  of  EPHB1  is  overrepre-
sented  in  HBV-infected  liver  disease  patients  and  that  it 
potentially  facilitates  integrin  alpha  v  beta  3-mediated 
increases  in  attachment  of  endothelial  cells  and  acti-
vated  integrin  alpha  v  beta  3-regulated  angiogenesis  in 
HCC.  These  results  provide  the  first  evidence  that  func-
tional  ht6  (T-G)  of  EPHB1  is  a  genetic  susceptibility  fac-
tor  for  the  development  of  CLD  and  HCC  in  a  Korean 
population. 
    Angiogenesis  plays  an  important  role  in  the  liver,  and 
its  role  in  HCC  has  been  studied.  Recently,  it  was  re-
ported  that  HCC  and  chronic  HBV  infection  are  asso-
ciated  with  alpha  v  integrins  (Lee et al.,  2008).  In  partic-
ular,  the  beta  3  subset  has  been  shown  to  mediate  en-
dothelial  cell  attachment  (Huynh-Do et al.,  1999).  The  in-
tegrin  alpha  v  beta  3  is  expressed  particularly  by  endo-
thelial  cells  that  are  involved  in  angiogenesis,  as  its  ex-
pression  clearly  is  increased  in  proliferating  vascular  en-
dothelial  cells  (Brooks et al.,  1994a;  Drake et al.,  1995). 
Moreover,  EPHB1  must  be  signaling-competent  in  order 
to  mediate  ephrinB1-induced  attachment  responses.  The 
ephrinB1-induced  increase  in  cell  attachment  suggests 
‘inside-out’  activation  of  alpha  v  beta  3  in  endothelial 
cells  (Huynh-Do et al.,  1999).  Eph  receptors  regulate  cell 
attachment  to  the  extracellular  matrix  by  modulating  in-
tegrin  activity. 
    Taken  together,  our  results  show  that  EPHB1  SNPs, 
haplotypes,  and  diplotypes  are  relevant  susceptibility 
markers  for  HBV-infected  liver  diseases.  In  previous 
studies,  EPHB1  signaling  has  been  shown  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  alpha  v  beta  3.  SNPs  and  haplotypes  of  al-
pha  v  integrins  are  associated  with  HBV-infected  HCC 
(Lee et al.,  2008).  Further  studies  are  needed  to  demon-
strate  by  gene-gene  interactions  that  SNPs  and  hap-
lotypes  of  EPHB1  and  integrin  alpha  v  are  associated 
with  HBV-infected  liver  diseases.
