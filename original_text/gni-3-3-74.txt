Abstract 
The H19 gene, located at human chromosome 11p15.5, 
is  imprinted  in  most  normal  human  tissues.  However, 
imprinting  is  often  lost  in  tumors  suggesting  H19  is  a 
putative  tumor  suppressor.  We  analyzed  the  single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a 16 kb region that 
includes the H19 gene and  its imprinting control  region 
(ICR)  in  the  Korean  population.  To  identify  SNPs,  we 
directly sequenced this region in 18 Korean subjects. We 
identified 64 SNPs, of which 7 were in the exons of H19, 
2 were in the introns, 14 were in the 3' intergenic region 
and 41  were in the 5' intergenic region. Of the 64 SNPs, 
21  had not previously been reported and thus appear to 
be unique to the Korean population. The identified SNPs 
of H19 in the Korean population may eventually be useful 
as genetic markers associated with various diseases. In 
this  study,  7  of  the  64  identified  SNPs  were  at  CTCF 
binding sites in the ICR and may affect regulation of H19 
gene imprinting. Thus,  several  genetic variations of the 
H19 gene may be important markers in human diseases 
that involve genomic imprinting, including cancer.

I ntrocluction 
The human H19 gene consists of five exons separated 
by four  introns.  Early  studies  mapped  it  to  11 p15.5,  a 
chromosomal  region  with  known  tumor  suppressor 
activity,  and  subsequent  analysis  revealed  that  H19 
expression  is often altered  in  several  different types of 
tumors relative to that in adjacent, non-transformed cells 
(Chung  et  a/.,  1996;  Cui  et  a/.,  1997).  The  human 
sequence has a putative ORF that appears to encode a

26 kDa protein but the gene product appears to be RNA 
rather  than  a  protein  (Hao  eta/.,  1993;  Joubel  eta/., 
1996;  Pfeifer  eta/.,  1996).  The  H19  gene  is  a  known 
imprinted  gene.  It  is  expressed  exclusively  from  the 
maternal  chromosome  and  is  linked  and  co-regulated 
with the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene,  IGF2, which is 
also imprinted but expressed primarily from the paternal 
chromosome (Bell eta/., 2000). 

A 2 kb region of differential methylation located from -2 
to -4 kb relative to the H19 transcriptional start site has 
been proposed to act as the imprinting mark (Davis eta/., 
1999). A differentially methylated region (DMR) upstream 
of H19 has been proposed to participate in the imprinting 
control of human IGF2 and H19 (Thorvaldsen, 1998). The 
DMR,  or  imprinting  control  region  (ICR),  acts  as  an 
epigenetic  modifier  of  allelic  expression  by  recruiting 
proteins that specifically bind to methylated or unmethylated 
DNA (Uianer  eta/.,  2003a).  In  human,  the  ICR contains 
seven specific binding sites for the zinc finger insulator 
protein CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) (Hark eta/., 2000). 
CTCF binds to several sites in the unmethylated ICR that 
are essential for enhancer blocking (Hark et al.,  2000). 
The methylation status of binding sites for CTCF in the 
H19 promoter is suggested to be involved in the regulation 
of imprinting of the H19/IGF2 locus (Takai  eta/., 2001 ). 
Only the sixth of the seven CTCF-binding sites has been 
demonstrated to have allele-specific differential methylation 
(Takai eta/., 2001 ). This region contains well characterized 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which  make it 
possible to distinguish the paternal and maternal alleles 
(Takai  eta/.,  2001).  Several  studies  have  used  two or 
three SNPs within the ICR to discriminate between the 
two alleles to investigate whether tumors have abnormal 
H19/IGF2 methylation (Nakagawa eta/., 2001; Ulaner et 
a/.,  2003a; Ulaner eta/., 2003b}. 

In this study, we analyzed SNPs in a 16 kb region that 
includes the  H19 gene and  its 2  kb  ICR  in  the  Korean 
population.  Our  results  provide  new  information  about 
several SNPs that may impact imprinting regulation.

Sequencing 
The primers used for sequencing are the same as those 
used  for  PCR  (Table  1 ).  Cycle  sequencing  reactions 
were  performed  using  PCR  product  and  an  Applied 
Biosystems  (Foster  City,  CA)  Big  Dye  Terminator 
(version 2.0) ready reaction kit. The amount of primer in 
the reaction was  1 pmol,  and total  reaction volume was 
10 /d.  Cycling parameters were:  30 cycles of 30 sec at 
95 OC,  5 sec at 50 째C, 4 min at 60째C, followed by refrigeration 
until use. Each reaction mixture was ethanol-precipitated 
to  remove  excess  dye  terminators.  The  pellets  were 
dissolved  in  11  td  template  suppression  reagent  (TSR, 
Applied  Biosystems),  heated  at  95 OC 
for  4  min  to 
denature, quenched on ice for 4 min, mixed, spun briefly, 
into  the  autosampler  tray  of  an  ABI3100 
loaded 
automated  DNA sequencer,  and  sequenced  according 
to the ABI3100 operator's manual. The sequencer was 
set up to  run using POP6 polymer and a 36 em capillary 
with 30 sec injection time and 120 min  run time. 

Identification of SNPs and haplotype analysis 
Polymorphisms were detected by multiple alignments of 
sequences  using  the  Phred/Phrap/  Consed  package 
(Ewing  eta/.  1998;  Gordon  eta/.  1998). Deviation from 
Hardy-Weinberg  expectancy  was  examined  with  x?  or 
Fisher's exact test. 

Haploview  software  (version  32)  was  used  for  the 
tagging  SNP  detection 

analysis  of  haplotype  and 
(Barrett, 2005). 

Results and Discussion 
We  discovered  64  SNPs  in  the  H19  region  (16  kb; 
NT _009237)  on  chromosome  11 p15.5  in  the  Korean 
population  (n=18).  This  region  contains  the  H19  gene 
(1.4  kb),  the  H19  promoter region  (2  kb),  an  imprinting 
control region (ICR) including CTCF binding sites (2 kb), 
and  an  intergenic  region  (-10  kb).  This  region  was 
amplified  from  samples  from  18  normal  Koreans  by 
using  PCR  primers  (Table  1 ).  The  PCR  products were 
directly  sequenced  to  analyze  the  SNPs.  The  dbSNP 
database  in  the  National  Center  for  Biotechnology 
Information  (NCBI)  has 93  SNPs in the  H19 region.  Of 
the  64  SNPs that  we  identified  in  this  region,  43 were 
identical to SNPs in the NCBI  database. The remaining 
21  were  thus  judged  to  be  novel 
the  Korean 

in 

DNA was extracted from blood with a QIAamp DNA Blood 
Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's 
protocol. The primer sets for the PCR walking analysis are 
shown  in  Table  1.  The  PCR reactions contained  20  ng 
genomic DNA, 0.2 units of AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin-Elmer, 
Weiterstadt,  Germany)  or  LA  taq  (Takara  Bio,  Otsu, 
Japan) polymerase, 1 mM dNTPs, 1 xPCR buffer, 5 pmol 
sense primer and 5 pmol  antisense primer in  20 td and 
were performed in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) at the 
following temperatures: 95"C for 5 min, 30 cycles at 95"C 
for 30 sec. at 60-68째C for 45 sec and at 72째C for 3 min.

population. Of the 64 SNPs, 7 were in exons and 2 were 
in  introns  (none  of  which  were  novel),  6  were  in  the 
promoter (1  of which  was novel),  7 were  in  the ICR (1 
novel), 28 were in the 5' intergenic region (16 novel), and 
14 were in the 3'  intergenic region (3 novel) (Table 2). 

We  investigated  the  haplotypes  of a  5.4  kb  region 
(Position:  780559-785146,  Table  2)  with  21  SNPs 
containing  the  H19  gene,  promoter  and  ICR.  The 
position  784496  SNP  (minimal  allele  frequency  <  5%) 
was  omitted.  The  patterns  of  haplotype  structure  and 
frequencies in this 5.4 kb gene region are shown in Table 
3.  There were 8 common haplotypes (frequency ;:o.  5%) 
and  11  tagging  SNPs were  found.  We  also  selected  4 
SNPs  (rs2839698,  rs2251375,  rs2071095,  rs4930103) 
that  were  present  in  both  our  data  and  the  HapMap 
database  (The 
International  HapMap  Consortium., 
2004)  and  analyzed 
the  haplotype  diversity  and 
frequency (Table 4). The frequencies of haplotype 1-4 in 
the  Korean  population  were  similar  with  those  in  the 
Japanese and Chinese populations but different from the 
frequency  in  the CEPH  population  (Utah  residents with 
ancestry from northern and western Europe).  Haplotype 
5 was the  common haplotype in the Korean population,

but was not found in the Japanese, Chinese, and CEPH 
populations  (Table 4).  Thus we find  that several  SNPs 
and  haplotypes  in  the  Korean  population  differ  from 
those in other ethnic groups. 

We only found 64 SNPs in this region compared with 
the 93 in the NCB I database. This may be due to our small 
sample  size  (n=18).  Detection  of  89%  of  polymorphic 
sites (minimal allele frequency of 5%) would require n=16, 
and detection of 99% would require n=48 (Kruglyak eta/., 
2001).  In our case,  with n=18,  we expect to detect over 
99% of SNPs with a minimal allele frequency of 20%. Thus 
we  do not expect to detect low frequency  SNPs  in  our 
sample.  In  addition  this  discrepancy  in  SNP  detection 
raises the possibility of invalid or extremely low frequency 
SNPs in the public databases and underlines the need to 
check the validity and frequency of any potential marker 
SNPs in an intended study population. 

The ICR of H19 is methylated from -2 to -4 kb relative 
to the start of transcription.  CTCF binding was  recently 
shown to play a direct role in inhibiting methylation of the 
ICR in  order to establish and  maintain  imprinting of the 
lgf2/H19 region, and CTCF binding sites were shown to be 
dispensable for initiating imprinting (Szabo eta/., 2004). 
The methylation status of this region was  ascertained  by 
bisulfite conversion and methylation-specific PCR (Uianer 
eta/., 2003b). The paternal allele is methylated and the 
maternal allele is unmethylated. The SNPs allow distinction 
of the paternal and maternal alleles. Of the six SNPs in the 
ICR that were previously reported, two (785015 (CIT) and 
785104  (GIT))  were  previously  analyzed  for  allelic 
expression based on the methylation status (Uianer eta!., 
2003b).  Bisulfite  DNA  sequencing  revealed  a  CIT 
polymorphism at base 785015 (an A/G polymorphism at 
base 6325; accession no. AF087017). The allele containing 
the A  polymorphism was  methylated,  whereas the allele 
containing  the  G  polymorphism  was  unrnethylated.  In 
addition,  Poon  et  a/.  (2002)  reported  that  paternally 
inherited methylated H19 fetal alleles were different from 
the methylated alleles of the respective mothers using a 
CIT  polymorphism  at  base  785015.  This  raised  the 
possibility  of  using  epigenetic  markers  for  the  specific 
detection of fetal  DNA in maternal plasma.  Furthermore, 
only the sixth  CTCF binding site showed allele-specific 
methylation (Takai eta!., 2001 ). The 785146 (A/G) site is 

Rg.1. Map of the human H19 region.  It contains the H19 gene (1.4 kb), a promoter region (2 kb), an imprinting control region (ICR 
2 kb), and an intergenic region (-1 0 kb).  On the bottom line the single nucleotide polymorph isms are represented by small vertica 
lines. The region examined in this report has 64 polymorphic sites (H19 gene; 9 sites, ICR; 7 sites).

located at the sixth CTCF binding site. This SNP site may 
act  as  a  marker  for  regulating  H19  expression. 
Nakayashiki et at. (2004) recently described three closely 
located  SNPs  (g/a  g7523a,  g/a  g7547a,  cit  c7591t; 
accession  no.  AF125183)  and designated them  as the 
H19FR haplotype. They were able to selectively discriminate 
the parental alleles by enzymatically digesting differentially 
methylated genomic DNA This method could be useful for 
identifying the parental origin of alleles.  However, these 
three SNPs were not present in the Korean population. In 
any  case,  SNPs  located  in  the  ICR  should  provide 
information about the methylation status determined by 
expression of H19 alleles. In addition, information on the 
methylation  status  of  the  H19  gene  may  help  to 
understand how imprinting is disrupted in tumors. 

Numerous studies have revealed abnormal imprinting 
of H19 in a wide range of tumors (Nakagawa eta/., 2001; 
Ulaner et at.,  2003a;  Manoharan et at.,  2003; Yin  eta/., 
2004). Loss of imprinting (LOI) of IGF2 correlated strongly 
with  biallelic  hypermethylation  in  a  core  region  of  an 
H19-associated  CTCF-binding  site  (Nakagawa  et a/., 
2001 ). The presence of this methylation-dependent LOI in 
both  tumors and  normal  colonic  mucosa indicates that 
hypermethylation may create a field defect predisposing 
to cancer (Nakagawa eta/., 2001 ).  In addition, incomplete 
gain or loss of methylation at this CTCF- binding site during 
tumorigenesis  can  explain  the  complex  and  conflicting 
expression patterns of IGF2 and H19 in a tumor (Uianer 
et at., 2003a). Manoharan eta/. (2003) used a SNP marker 
in the H19 coding sequence to investigate H19 imprinting. 
They found monoallelic expression of the maternal gene 
in  fetal  liver,  but biallelic expression in  liver neoplasms, 
thus demonstrating the basis for the deregulation of the 
imprinted gene expression during hepatocarcinogenesis. 
The  imprinting  of  IGF2/H19  is  similar  to  DLK1/GTL2, 
another  reciprocally  imprinted  gene  pair.  The  imprinting 
status of DLK1  in brain tumors and lymphomas has also 
been deduced by analysis of a SNP (Yin et at., 2004). We 
propose that the polymorphic sites of H19 are good genomic 
markers for imprinting studies of additional tumor types. 

H19 was one of the first imprinted genes to be identified 
in mice and humans. It is an excellent model for studies of 
genomic imprinting because it is a representative imprinting 
gene  in  human  and  other  animals.  In  the  mouse, 
monoallelic  expression  of  H19  is  regulated  by  an  ICR 
located at chromosome 7 (Thorvaldsen et at.,  1998) and 
CTCF binding has been shown to have a role at four sites 
in the IGF2/H191CR (Szabo et at., 2004; Schoenherr eta/., 
2003; Thorvaldsen et at., 2002). A mutation in the mouse 
CTCF site 4 was sufficient to cause robust activation of the 
maternal  lgf2 allele and  to disturb the  methylation-free 
status of the maternal H19 ICR allele (Pant eta/., 2004). 

H19 is also imprinted in cattle, in which the maternal allele 
was found to be predominantly or exclusively expressed 
in all tissues examined (Zhang eta/., 2004). Identification 
of a SNP in the bovine H19 gene made it possible to study 
its imprinting status by following the expression of parental 
alleles in  heterozygous animals.  The  present results will 
help to analyze sequences and SNPs of the H19 region in 
other mammals (e.g., pig and sheep). The SNPs that we 
identified  can  be  used  as  markers  for  the  study  of 
developmental abnormalities. The SNPs of the H19 gene 
discovered  in  this  study  should  be  useful  as  genomic 
markers for imprinting studies. Particularly, they should be 
useful as markers in types of tumors that involve genomic 
imprinting. We are planning a case-control study of cancer 
using the SNPs discovered in the Korean population.
