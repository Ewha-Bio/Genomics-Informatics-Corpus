Development of liver cancers is driven largely by genomic alterations that deregulate signaling pathways, influencing growth 
and survival of cancer cells. Because of the hundreds or thousands of genomic/epigenomic alterations that have accumulated 
in the cancer genome, it is very challenging to find and test candidate genes driving tumor development and progression. 
Systematic studies of the liver cancer genome have become available in recent years. These studies have uncovered new 
potential  driver  genes,  including  those  not  previously  known  to  be  involved  in  the  development  of  liver  cancer.  Novel 
approaches combining multiple datasets from patient tissues have created an unparalleled opportunity to uncover potential 
new therapeutic targets and prognostic/predictive biomarkers for personalized therapy that can improve clinical outcomes of 
the patients with liver cancer.

Introduction

Primary liver cancer is one of the most common cancers in 
the  world,  accounting  for  an  estimated  600,000  deaths 
annually  [1]. In Korea, liver  cancer is the second leading 
cause of cancer-related deaths (10,946 death in 2010) [2]. In 
the  United  States,  primary  liver  cancer  has  gained  major 
interest, because the incidence of liver cancer has increased 
over the past 25 years, and the incidence and mortality rate 
of liver cancer are expected to double over the next 10 to 20 
years  [3-5].  Therefore,  prevention  and  treatment  of  liver 
cancer are of great concern. 

While primary liver cancer is one of the few cancers with 
well-defined major risk factors, such as hepatitis virus infec-
tion, alcohol consumption, and obesity, the molecular patho-
genesis of liver cancer is not well understood [6-8]. Patients 
with liver cancer have a highly variable clinical course [7, 9], 
indicating  that  liver  cancer  comprises  several  biologically 
distinct subgroups. Therefore, it will be necessary to under-
stand  liver  cancer  at  a  genomic  and  molecular  level  for 
improved stratification of patients, identification of novel 
druggable targets, and development of personalized treat-
ment, based on the biological characteristics of tumors in 
each patient. 

activation  of  many  different  oncogenes  or  inactivation  of 
different tumor suppressor genes and progress by additional 
genetic or epigenetic alterations, conventional gene-by-gene 
approaches are likely to deliver only a limited understanding 
of the biological and pathological characteristics of cancer 
cells. However, the recent development of technologies for 
gene expression profiling, genome-wide copy number ana-
lysis, and whole-genome sequencing has enabled the com-
prehensive characterization of entire cancer genomes. This 
information promises to improve our understanding of the 
genetic and epigenetic alterations driving the development 
of liver cancer, as well as ultimately provide guidance on 
personalized treatment of patients. Although these large- 
scale genomic data promise improvement in the treatment of 
liver  cancer,  challenges  remain  for  the  management  and 
integration of these data for a better understanding of how 
these alterations give rise to the development of liver cancer 
and, most importantly, the translation of these findings into 
personalized patient treatment.

and copy number aberrations in the cancer genome [10], 
cytogenetic  methods  have  been  used  widely  to  find  the 
genetic changes in cancer genomes. The CGH method was 
the first tool to provide a genome-wide investigation of copy- 
number alterations in cancer [11]. Increased or decreased 
regions of copy number are believed to have either onco-
genes or tumor suppressor genes. Although the resolution of 
early CGH mapping technology is limited by 2 Mbp (high- 
copy-number amplifications) to 10 Mbp (low-copy-number 
amplification or deletion), this method has identified many 
loci  for  oncogenes  and  tumor  suppressor  genes  in  liver 
cancer. Multiple studies have reported amplification of the 
8q24 loci, in which MYC is located [12-15]. Other studies 
also identified prevalent amplification of the 1q, 6p, and 17q 
regions and frequent deletion of the 8p, 16q, 4q, and 17p 
regions [12, 15]. 

Microarray-based technologies

Microarray  technology  has  been  used  extensively  to 
gather global-scale data from cell lines or tissues of interest. 
This technology was first used to make a quantitative assess-
ment  of  mRNAs  or  non-coding  RNAs.  Gene  expression 
profiling  studies  based  on  microarray  technologies  have 
identified  conserved  gene  expression  signatures  that  are 
significantly related with clinical outcomes or pathological 
phenotypes and have uncovered many subgroups of cancer 
that were not recognized with conventional approaches in a 
variety of cancers [16-18]. These approaches have been used 
successfully  to  identify  therapeutic  targets  for  various 
cancers  and  to  predict  overall  survival  or  recurrence-free 
survival rates of cancer patients [19-21]. 

Use of microarray technology is not restricted to genome- 
wide gene expression profiling of cells or tissues but expands 
to uncovering single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated 
with  cancer  risk,  methylation  status  of  gene  promoters, 
DNA copy number alterations, protein expression profiling, 
and re-sequencing of cancer genomes. Because microarray- 
based CGH can provide copy-number analyses with much 
higher  resolution  than  conventional  CGH,  it  has  quickly 
replaced conventional CGH [22, 23]. 

Microarray technologies were also adopted by the prote-
omics  community.  Protein  microarray  was  quickly  est-
ablished by rapid improvements to miniaturizing western 
blotting and tissue lysate dotting  technologies onto solid 
surfaces. There are two different experimental approaches 
for protein arrays: forward-phase protein array (FPPA) and 
reverse-phase protein array (RPPA). In FPPA, antibodies or 
polypeptides  are  printed  on  the  slide  surface,  and  each 
slide?is  incubated  with  labeled  tissue  or  cell  lysate.  This 
approach  allows one to  simultaneously measure  multiple 
protein  features,  such  as  expression,  interaction  with 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

peptide  ligands,  and  protein  phosphorylation,  from  the 
samples. In RPPA, an individual tissue lysate in printed on 
the slide surface, and each RPPA slide consists of hundreds 
or thousands of tissue samples. Each slide is then probed 
with one peptide ligand or antibody at a time, and a protein 
feature of interest is assessed and compared across many 
tissues  or  cell  lines.  Because  RPPA  needs  only  several 
thousands of cells to collect high-quality data, it is better 
suited for cancer research. In contrast, FPPA is not suitable 
for tissue-based studies, because it needs a large quantity of 
tissue or cell lysate for detection [24-27]. 

Next-generation sequencing

Due to the emergence of second-generation sequencing 
technologies  that  allow  massive  parallel  collection  of  se-
quence information, the cost per base for sequencing the 
entire genome has reduced dramatically  [28]. These new 
technologies provided unique opportunities to investigate 
all  sequences  of  entire  cancer  genomes  to  uncover  the 
genetic changes that arise during cancer development. Many 
different  technologies  have  been  developed  by  different 
companies: Roche Applied Science (454 Genome Sequencer 
FLX  System;  Indianapolis,  IN,  USA),  Life  Technologies 
(Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection or 
SOLiD; Carlsbad, CA, USA), Illumina (Genome Analyzer II; 
San Diego, CA, USA), Helicos BioSciences (HeliScope Single 
Molecule Sequencer; Cambridge, MA, USA), and Ion Torrent 
Systems  (now  owned  by  Life  Technologies,  Ion  Proton 
System).

These new technologies have been used to identify poten-
tial  driver  mutations  in  the  development  of  liver  cancer 
through whole-genome and -exome sequencing. The first 
sequencing of the primary liver cancer genome revealed a 
total of 11,731 somatic mutations [29]. Following studies 
showed  that  the  CTNNB1,  TP53,  and  EGFR  genes  were 
frequently mutated in liver cancer [30-33]. Additionally, the 
ARID family, including ARID1A, ARID1B, and ARID2, was 
mutated in about half of all tumors, suggesting a potential 
role of them in the development of liver cancer. 

Gene Expression Profiling of Liver Cancer

In previous studies [18, 34-37], gene expression data from 
human liver cancer have identified several subgroups that 
are significantly associated with clinical outcomes, such as 
overall survival and recurrence-free survival. These findings 
strongly indicated that gene expression patterns faithfully 
reflect  biological  and  pathological  heterogeneity  among 
patients with liver cancer and would be highly valuable in 
predicting  the  clinical  outcome  of  patients.  The  current 
challenge for clinical use is to identify those who will not

benefit from conventional treatments and to offer alternative 
therapies.  If  master  drivers,  such  as  genes  or  pathways 
determining the biological characteristics of the tumors, can 
be identified, we can explore their therapeutic potentials. 
However,  gene  expression  profiling  approaches  are  also 
limited, because they only provide information related to 
transcriptional regulation. 

Integromics: Integration of multiple-omics data

Previous studies undoubtedly showed that gene expres-
sion  patterns  (or  signatures)  are  useful  markers  that  can 
stratify patients and offer useful prognostic information [18, 
37-42]. The current research focus has moved to uncovering 
genetic/epigenetic factors that are key regulators of specific 
signaling  pathways  altered  in  malignant  cancer  cells, 
potentially guiding the discovery of new therapeutic (and 
druggable)  targets  [8,  43-45].  But,  the  selection  of  such 
candidates  for  future  validations  from  long  gene  lists 
produced by genome-wide screening is a significant chal-
lenge because of potential confounding factors embedded in 
many genome-wide data from human cancers. Furthermore, 
because the gene expression data from tumor tissues only 
provide âsnapshotâ information of genetic/epigenetic altera-
tions and lack in-depth information on interactive and time- 
dependent alterations during tumor progression, it is not 
easy to distinguish the driver genes from passenger genes 
whose alterations simply echo changes in cell proliferation 
or organ physiology.  

As discussed earlier, CGH analyses have identified many 
recurrent candidate loci of DNA copy number changes in 
liver  cancer.  Some  of  these  genomic  regions  have  well- 
recognized tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. How-
ever, because of the large number of candidate genes in the 
identified  genomic  loci,  functional  validation  of  all  can-
didates  would  be  impractical.  Thus,  there  is  an  urgent 
demand  for  development  of  a  new  approach  that  would 
quickly prioritize candidates according to the likelihood of 
their direct involvement in tumor development. 

In a previous study, systematic integration of gene copy 
number data and gene expression from the same patients has 
been proposed to identify potential driver genes [46]. This 
study demonstrated that DNA copy number alteration data 
provide additional prognostic significance. Integrative analy-
sis  of  copy  number  alteration  data  and  gene  expression 
further identified 50 driver candidates whose activation was 
triggered by copy number amplifications of genes and also 
significantly associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes in 
liver cancer. 

Alterations in DNA copy number and expression patterns 
of thousands of genes are important characteristics of many 
cancer cells. Because the use of high-throughput microarray- 

based technologies, mass spectrometry, and second-gene-
ration  sequencers  for  the  analysis  of  cancer  genomes 
inevitably produces many false-positive results, it is not easy 
to  select  practical  numbers  of  candidate  genes  for  future 
evaluation of them as therapeutic targets and/or prognostic/ 
predictive biomarkers. Therefore, it is important to combine 
two or more genomic scale datasets (e.g., array-based CGH 
data,  promoter  methylation,  and  expression  of  coding  or 
non-coding genes), collected independently from the same 
tissues (Fig. 1).

RPPA  is  a  newly  established  proteomic  technology 
[24-27]  that  provides  quantitative  assessment  of  the 
expression and modification of many proteins. For example, 
the  phosphorylation  level  of  particular  proteins  can  be 
estimated  easily  by  using  antibodies  specific  to  certain 
phosphorylation  sites  of  proteins.  Use  of  the  phosphory-
lation antibodies allows us to assess the signaling pathways 
by  looking  at  many  kinase  substrates  simultaneously 
through  multiplexed  phosphorylation-specific  antibody 
analysis.  However,  assessment  of  signaling  pathways  by 
RPPA is restricted by the availability of antibodies with very 
high specificity. This limitation can be overcome by inte-
gration  of multiple  datasets  for  systematic analysis.  Inte-
gration  of  proteomic  data  with  genomic  data  would  sig-
nificantly help us have better insights into tumor develop-
ment and progression. Furthermore, contributor genes (or 
drivers) will be quickly identified by integration of proteomic 
data with one or more genomic datasets. 

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project: new 
opportunity for cancer genomics

TCGA is a landmark research program supported by the 
National Human Genome Research Institute and National 
Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health in the 

Fig. 1. Integromics approaches. Genomics data provide long lists 
of  candidate  driver  genes  or  proteins.  Integration  of  these 
independently generated data from the same specimens will greatly
improve the chance of identifying real driver genes or therapeutic
targets.

United States that was started as a pilot project in 2006 and 
expanded  later  in  2009.  The  goal  of  TCGA  is  to  collect 
comprehensive genomic and proteomic information on all 
major human cancers, including liver cancer. Initial efforts 
focused  on  glioblastoma,  lung  squamous  cell  cancer,  and 
ovarian cancer as pilot projects [47-50]. By using various 
different platforms, TCGA currently gathers many different 
genome-wide data, including mRNA expression, microRNA 
expression,  somatic  mutations,  copy  number  alterations, 
and  promoter  methylation.  In  addition,  it  also  generates 
proteomic data by using RPPA technology. The project plans 
to collect genomic and proteomic data from more than 500 
tissues per cancer type and release the data to the public 
without any restriction in use of the data (Table 1). 

This ambitious project has identified novel driver genes 
and  biomarkers  on  the  basis  of  genomic,  transcriptomic, 
proteomic, and epigenomic alterations. Some findings are 
clinically  relevant  and  unexpected.  For  example,  we  have

now learned that non-hypermutated adenocarcinomas of the 
colon  and  rectum  are  not  distinguishable at  the genomic 
level [51]. In lung squamous cell cancer, while KRAS and 
EGFR mutations, the most commonly activated oncogenes in 
lung adenocarcinoma, are extremely rare, alterations in the 
FGFR kinase family are common [49]. Thus, massive data 
from  a  large  number  of  tissues  have  created  an  unpre-
cedented  opportunity  for  taking  an  integrated  approach 
toward  a  systems-level  understanding  of  disruptions  in 
cellular and molecular pathways in cancer. 

Conclusion

Genomics has become a dominant tool for understanding 
cancer biology, revealing unexpected surprises and providing 
cancer classification according to biological differences. The 
amount of liver cancer-related genomic data that have gene-
rated during the past few years is really incredible. Analysis 
approaches of these data have been advanced to efficiently 
process this information and allow us to perform integrated 
genome-wide  analysis  on  a  scale  previously  unthinkable. 
These approaches are also beginning to investigate the dense 
network of molecular pathways driving the development of 
liver cancer. The anticipated benefits of these data will be 
more a faithful assessment of prognosis than the current 
stage system, improved prediction of treatment response, 
and discovery of new therapeutic targets. Future challenges 
lie in translating this discovery into personalized treatment 
for the patient with liver cancer.
