Next generation sequencing (NGS) has been facilitating 
the discovery and functional validation of causal variants in 
diverse rare diseases. However, for most of the 7,000 rare 
diseases, pathogenic mechanisms are still unknown. In this 
issue, Dr. Murim Choi’s group (Seoul National University, 
Korea)  comprehensively  reviewed  ultra-rare  diseases  and 
genomics-driven  precision  medicine.  They  presented  the 
perspectives gained from recent studies on ultra-rare diseases 
which  were  diagnosed  by  NGS  analysis  and  successfully 
treated. They also discussed the potential obstacles to wider 
application of NGS-based precision medicine. Dr. Young-Joon 
Kim’s group (Yonsei University, Korea) reported classification 
of colorectal cancer patients based on promoter methylation 
patterns. They used colon cancer data sets from the Cancer 
Genome Atlas to observe CpG islands that showed significant 
aberrations in DNA methylation and also analyzed changes 

in  DNA  methylation  patterns  to  assess  the  relationships 
between epigenetic changes and tumorigenesis. Dr. Jong Il 
Kim’s group (Seoul National University, Korea) reported the 
genome-wide association study which evaluated the effects 
of genetic polymorphisms on the bone mineral density at the 
lumbar spine and femur in Korean men. Investigating the 
etiology of osteoporosis in males of East Asian descent can 
have high diagnostic and clinical implications. Dr. Thirumudi’s 
group (Kamalnayan Bajaj Institute for Research in Vision 
and Ophthalmology, India) reported two potential inhibitors 
targeting the hydrophobic cleft of Toxoplasma gondii apical 
membrane antigen 1 (AMA1).
