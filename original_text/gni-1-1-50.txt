Abstract 

Genome  of an  extreme  thermophile,  Thermus 
ca/dophilus GK24 has been analyzed to construct the 
genomic  map.  The  genomic  DNAs  encapsulated  in 
agarose  gel  were  digested with Sspl, EcoRI,  Spel, 
and  Hpal  restriction  endonucleases,  and  then  the 
resulting  genomic  DNA fragments  were  analyzed  by 
pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis.  Its restriction  map 
has  been  constructed  by analyzing  sizes  of the 
restriction  fragments  obtained  from  both  complete 
and partial digestions. The circular form of its genome 
was composed  of about 1.98 Mbp and  a megaplas(cid:173)
mid.  The  genomic  loci  for the  genes  of xylose 
isomerase,  thioredoxin,  tRNA-168  rRNA,  238  rRNA, 
L5  ribosomal  protein,  ADP-glucose  pyrophosphor(cid:173)
ylase,  DNA-ligase,  and  Tea  DNA  polymerase were 
determined by both Southern hybridization and PCR.

Introduction 

The  discovery of the  genus  Thermus  opened  a  detailed 
study  on  the  physiology  of  extreme  thermophilic  bacteria, 
and  provided  a  unique  application  of thermo  stable 
enzymes  to  DNA  recombinant  technology  and  industrial 
uses.  Thermus  ca/dophilus  GK24  strain  is  a  gram(cid:173)
negative,  extreme  aerophilic  and  thermophilic  bacterium 
and  also  can  usually  grow  at  75 'C.  So  far  genetic 
information  concerning  this  strain  is  limited  to  only  two 
enzymes,  LDH  (Koide  et a/.,  1991)  and  Tea  DNA 
polymerase (Park eta/., 1992) reported. 

The  method  of pulsed-field  gel  electrophoresis  (PFGE) 
of  large  fragments  of  chromosomal  DNA  (Suwanto eta/., 
1989),  generated  by  using  rarely  cutting  restriction 
endonucleases,  has  made  it  possible  to  map  megabase 
regions  of  eukaryotes and  whole  genomes  of  prokaryotes 
(Schwartz  et a/.,  1983 and  Bancroft  et a/.,  1989). 
Approximately  40  bacterial  genome  maps  (Krawiec eta/., 
1990)  have  been  constructed  this  way.  These  maps 
provide  low  physical  resolution,  so  their  utility  has  been 
primarily to  demonstrate  the  mapping  strategy and  to 
confirm existing genetic maps (Smith eta/., 1987). 

In this report,  we describe the physical  map of Thermus 
caldophilus  GK24  genome  using  pulse-field  gel 
electrophoresis with the  restriction fragments.  Also  several 
genes  of  xylose  isomerase,  thioredoxin,  tRNA-16S  rRNA, 
23S  rRNA,  L5  ribosomal  protein,  ADP-glucose  pyrophos(cid:173)
phorylase,  DNA-ligase, and Tea DNA polymerase (Park et 
a/.,  1992)  were  located  on  the  genome  map  by  blot 
hybridization technique. 

Results 

Total  genome  size  of  the  T.  caldophilus  GK24  including 
extrachromosomal  DNAs  is  about  1.98  Mbp  (Table  1), 
which  was  estimated,  based  on the  sizes of the  restriction 
fragments  of  genomic  DNA  and  megaplasmids,  which 
were  obtained  from  their digestions  by Sspl,  EcoRI,  Spel, 
and Hpal  endonucleases,  respectively.  Interestingly it was 
found  that the  simple  restriction  enzymes  recognizing  A 
and  T  nucleotides  gave  a  few  restriction  fragments, 
because the genomes of Thermus bacteria have high G+C 
nucleotides.  It  facilitated  the  construction  of  genome 
mapping.  For  example,  Sspl  digest of  the  genomic  DNA 
gave 7 genomic fragments, 699,574,393, 309,  150*, 114*, 
and  64*  kb,  in  which  the  asterisks  indicate  the  origin  of

1,980  kbp  (Table  1 and  Fig.  1 ).  Likewise,  the  digests  of 
EcoRI  (631,  333,  272,  225,  219,  185,  164,  121*,  86*,  and

(666,  335, 281, 249,  173,  158, 75,  and 38 kbp)  gave about 
1 ,975,  2,029,  1 ,940,  and  1 ,975  kb  respectively.  On  the 
other  hand,  T.  caldophilus  GK24  carries  one  circular 

extrachromosommal DNAs, which are shown in  PFGE, but 
we  could  not  detect  some  of their  restriction  fragments  in 
PFGE  (data  not shown).  As  a  result,  T.  caldophilus  GK24 
has  medium  size  of  genome,  when  compared  with 
genome  sizes  of  other  prokaryotes,  which  range  between 
600 and 6,000 kbp.

fragments,  partial  restriction  digests  of  the  genome  were 
analyzed  by  FPGE.  For  example,  complete  and  partial 
digests  of  the  genome  with  Sspl,  gave  seven  and  ten 
restriction  fragments,  and  complete  and  partial  digests  of 
the genome with EcoRI, gave ten and sixteen,  respectively 
(Table  2 and  Fig.  2).  By  analyzing  the  possible  com(cid:173)
binations  among  the  complete  digests  for  the  partial 
restriction  fragments,  a partial  digest  fragments  of  1 065 
kbp  with  Sspl  endonuclease  could  be  from  Ss1+Ss3 
(Ssp1);  likewise,  another fragments of 965 and  674kb are, 
respectively,  from  Ss2+Ss4  (Ssp2)  and  Ss3+Ss4  (Ssp3) 
(Table  2).  Moreover,  the  double  restriction  digests could 
confirm  the  linkage  further.  For  example,  the  double 
digestion with Sspl and EcoRI  revealed that S2 didn't have 
EcoRI  site  (Fig.  2).  The  chromosomal  restriction  patterns 
for  EcoRI  involved  ten  restriction  fragments  ranging  from

631  to 52 kb (Table 1 ).  A partial EcoRI  digest fragments of 
T.  caldophilus  GK24  chromosome  was  shown  in  Table  2 
and  Fig.  2.  Furthermore,  cross-hybridization  method could 
establish  the  linkage  of the  genomic fragments  on  the 
physical  map.  For  example,  when  hybridization  with  Ss1 
fragments  as  a probe  was  performed  to  determine the 
relative  position  of  the  EcoRI  fragments  on  the 
chromosome,  S1  probe  was  hybridized  on  Ec1,  Ec2  and 
Ec6 fragments.  As  a result,  the  linkage analysis with Sspl 
showed  the  chromosome  to  have  circular  form.  The 
complete  restriction  map  of  T.  calaophilus  GK24 
chromosome  with  Sspl,  EcoRI,  Spel,  and  Hpal  endonu(cid:173)
cleases could have been constructed (Fig. 3). 

Positions of genes such as carbohydrate-related genes, 
rRNAs,  ribosomal protein, and DNA binding proteins on the 
restriction  map  have  been  determined  by  hybridization  of 
gene  probes  and  PCR  product  probes  (Table  3).  Their 
positions  could  be  compared  with  those  of  microor(cid:173)
ganisms, and predict their relative positions in the genome 
ofT. acidophilus GK24 (Fig. 4).

Discussion 

The  molecular size  of  several  bacterial  genomes  such  as 
eubacterium,  E.  coli  (Smith,  1987),  thermophilic archae(cid:173)
bacterium,  Thermococcus  celer (Noil,  1989),  thermophilic 
Streptococcus  thermophilus,  and  obligatory  aerobic 
eubacterium,  Thermus  thermophilus  has  been  reported. 
Most bacterial  genomes  comprise  one  circular chro(cid:173)
mosome,  as  determined  by  genetic  mapping  and  con(cid:173)
firmed  by  physical  mapping  (Smith  eta/.,  1987).  Two 
possible exceptions to  a single circular chromosome  draw 
attention.  One  is  Rhodobacter sphaeroides,  which  may 
have  two  distinct circular chromosomes;  the  other  is  the 
spirochete  Borrelia  burgdorferi,  which  appears to  have  a 
linear chromosome  in  addition  to  plasmids,  which  have 
covalently closed  ends.  Generally,  chromosome  sizes 
estimated  by  PFGE  and  shape  determined  from  ordered 
libraries  of  restriction  fragments  indicated  bacterial 
chromosomes  are  commonly  circular  and  1 to  9  Mb.  A 
physical  map  of  the  T.  ca/dophilus  GK24  genome  has 
been  constructed  by  using  PFGE  and  hybridization 
experiments.  The  size  of  the  genome,  1.98  Mbp,  was 
smaller than that of E. coli.  It is close in  size to the 2.3-Mbp 
genome Hemophilu parainfluenzae  (Kauc  and  Goodgal, 
1989) and Staphylococuss anguis (Bourgeois eta/., 1989). 
The construction  of contigs of certain genomic fragment 
and hybridization  experiments can  be  used to improve the 
fine genome map and localize some gene cluster of the T. 
caldophilus GK24 genome.  Lately we have cloned  genes, 
such  as  DNA  polymerase,  Thioredoxin,  DNA-ligase, 
Xylose  isomerase,  ADP-glucose  pyrophosphorylase, 
tRNAvai-16S rRNA,  23S rRNA,  Ribosomal protein. Among 
them,  rRNAs  are  easily  useful  to  be  used  as  probes to 
determine the  abundance,  arrangement,  composition,  and 
location of rrn  loci (Krawiec and Riley 1990). Particularly, T. 
caldophilus  GK24  has  two  rrn  loci  same  as  Thermus 
thermophilus  (Hartman  and  Erdman,  1989)  and  Pirellula 
marina  (Liesack  and  Stackebrandt,  1989),  while  the 
members of the  Enterobacteriaceae,  such  as  E.  coli  have 
seven rrn  loci. Use of EcoRI  restriction endonuclease could 
find  the  polymorphism  of  in  the  physical  map  of  several 
Thermus strains,  T.  aquaticus YT-1,  T.  thermophilus HB27, 
and T.  flavus  AT-62.  It would  be  interesting to compare the 
physical  map  of  these  strains  for  ladder pattern  of  EcoRI 
fragments in relation to the evolution of prokaryotes. 

Up  to  date,  over 85  microorganisms  were  sequenced 
completely.  Comparison  of  a Thermus  genome  to  other 
prokaryotic genomes should lead to a better understanding 
of  microbial  adaptation  to  extreme  conditions,  such  as 
hypertemperaure,  damaging  radiation,  and  an  oxidizing 
atmosphere.  Indeed,  the  availability  of the  complete 
genome  sequence  for  this  thermo  stable  microbe  should 

facilitate  a  wide  range  of  studies  and  establish  this 
thermopile as a model organism among the gram-negative 
bacteria.  Also,  organization  into carbohydrate  related  gene 
clusters  is  an  essential  and  useful of industrial  goal.  To 
investigate  gene  clusters,  we  are  going  to  focus  on  the 
relationship  of  relative  loci  about  carbohydrate  related 
genes  in  between  T.  caldophilus  GK24  and  E.  coli. 
Furthermore,  we  can  easily  isolated  useful  genes  in 
industrial goals. 

Material and Methods 
Strain and culture conditions 
Thermus  caldophilus  GK24  cells  (Taguchi  eta/.,  1982) 
were grown at 75°C,  16 h in medium (pH 7.2) consisting of 
0.8%  polypeptone,  0.2%  yeast  extract and  a  basal  salt 
mixture as described previously (Matsuzawa and Hamaoki, 
1983).  Then  chloramphenicol  (180 ,ug/ml)  was  added  into 
culture which was maintained for another 4 h. 

Preparation of plugs 
Agarose plugs containing genomic DNA were prepared as 
described  by  Bancroft et a/.  (Bancroft et a/.,  1989).  Cells 
grown  to  late  log  or  stationary  phase  were  chilled  by 
swirling  in  an  ice  bath  and  pelleted  by  centrifugation  at 
3,500  rpm  for  1 Omin  at  4 oc  in  a clinical  centrifuge.  Cells 
were  then  washed  by  resuspension  in  1Om I of  a  buffer 
(1 OmM  Tris-HCI,  1M  NaCI,  pH7.6),  and  followed  by 
centrifugation.  After resuspending the  cells thoroughly  in  a 
suspension  buffer  (0.01 M Tris-HCI,  pH  8.0,  0.1 M  EDT A, 
0.02M  NaCI),  the  cells  were  incubated  at 37-42"C,  and 
then were diluted with an equal volume of 1.5% low melting 
temperature  agarose  (FMC  Bio-Products,  Rockland, 
Maine)  in  sterile  125mM  EDTA solution.  The  solution  was 
poured  into  a  mould  chamber  (avoid  air  bubbles)  and 
cooled  the  mold  at  -20oc  for  5min.  Then  the  plugs  were 
transferred  to  the  equal  volume  of TC  lysis  solution  (6mM 
Tris-HCI,  pH7.6,  1M  NaCI,  100mM  EDTA,  0.5%  Sarkosyl, 
1mg/ml  lysozyme)  and  were  incubated  for  10min  at  37"C 
with  gentle  shaking.  Discarded  the  solution  and  washed 
the agarose plug three times for 30min in 0.05M EDT A (pH 
8.0).  And  then  the  plugs  were  incubated  in  an  equal 
volume of ESP solution  (0.5M  EDTA,  1% laura!  sarcosine, 
1 mg/ml proteinase K)  for 16 h at 50 oc  with  gentle shaking. 
In  order to  remove  proteinase  K solution  completely,  the 
plugs  transferred  to  1 mM  TE  (pH  8.0)  solution  containing 
1 mM  PMSF  and  then  incubated  for  1 h  at  room 
temperature.  The  prepared  plugs  were  stored  in  0.05M 
EDT A  (pH  8.0)  at  4 oc.  Restriction  enzyme  digestion  of 
DNA  in  agarose  plugs.  Agarose  plugs  containing  1 mg  of 
genomic  DNA  were  subjected  to  digestion  with  restriction 
endonucleases  in  0.1 ml  of  the  respective  restriction

endonuclease  buffer containing  0.01%  bovine  serum 
albumin for 20h  at 37•c.  For these experiments,  restriction 
endonucleases  (40  units,  ea.),  Sspl  (B.  M.),  EcoRI 
(Promega),  Spel  (B.  M.),  and Hpal  (B.  M.)  were  used.  For 
partial  digestion,  Sspl  (1  U)  and  EcoRI  (1  U)  were  used. 
After  restriction  endonuclease  digestion,  plugs  were 
washed  in  50 volume of solution  containing  TE  buffer (pH 
8.0).  Using  a  disposable  pipette  tip,  1/3 of  an  insert was 
mounted on the teeth of an electrophoresis comb. 

Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) 
The gel was cast with 1.0% (WN) Sea-Kem agarose in 0.5 
X TBE buffer.  The gel was electrophoresesed at 14 ·c  in a 
CHEF  DRII  apparatus  (Bio-Rad  Laboratories)  in  field 
strength  of  1 OV /em.  To  resolve  restriction  fragments  over 
1 OOOkb,  switching  times  was  120 sec.  To  separate 
restriction  fragments  between  6  and  600  kb,  a  gradual 
change  of  switching  intervals  from  25  to  75  sec was 
employed.  For separation of fragment sizes between 4 and 
200 kb, the gel was run 24 h at 200 V with a ramp of switch 
time  from  5 to  25  sec.  After electrophoresis,  gels  were 
stained  with  ethidium  bromide  for  30  min  and  pho(cid:173)
tographed with polaroid film. 

Hybridization 
DNA  probes  were  32P-Iabeled  using  random  oligonu(cid:173)
cleotide  primers  (Feinberg  and  volgelstein,  1984). 
Hybridization  experiments  with  DNA  probes  were 
performed at 65·c in 0.1% SDS (sodium dodecylsulphate), 
5  X  SSC,  1%  laurylsarcosin,  and  1%  blocking  reagent. 
Gels  were washed with  0.1% SDS,  2X SSC  (0.3  M NaCI, 
30mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 65·c.
