Abstract

Histone  deacetylation  and  demethylation  are  epigenetic 
mechanisms  implicated  in  cancer.  Studies  regarding  the 
role  of  modulation  of  gene  expression  utilizing  the  his-
tone  deacetylase  inhibitor  scriptaid  and  the  demethylat-
ing  agent  5-azacytidine  in  HL-60  leukemia  cells  have 
been  limited.  We  studied  the  possibility  of  recovering 
epigenetically  silenced  genes  by  scriptaid  and  5-azacyti-
dine  in  human  leukemia  cells  by  DNA  microarray 
analysis.  The  first  group  was  leukemia  cells  that  were 
cultured  with  5-azacytidine.  The  second  group  was  cul-
tured  with  scriptaid.  The  other  group  was  cultured  with 
both  agents.  Two  hundred  seventy  newly  developed 
genes  were  expressed  after  the  combination  of  5-azacy-
tidine  and  scriptaid.  Twenty-nine  genes  were  unchanged 
after  the  combination  treatment  of  5-azacytidine  and 
scriptaid.  Among  the  270  genes,  13  genes  were  differed 
significantly  from  the  control. HPGD, CPA3, CEACAM6, 
LOC653907,  ETS1,  RAB37,  PMP22,  FST,  FOXC1,  and 
CCL2  were  up-regulated,  and IGLL3, IGLL1,  and ASS1 
were  down-regulated.  Eleven  genes  associated  with  on-
cogenesis  were  found  among  the  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes:  ETS1,  ASCL2,  BTG2,  BTG1,  SLAMF6, 
CDKN2D, RRAS, RET, GIPC1, MAGEB,  and  RGL4.  We 
report  the  results  of  our  leukemia  cell  microarray  profiles 
after  epigenetic  combination  therapy  with  the  hope  that 
they  are  the  starting  point  of  selectively  targeted  epi-
genetic  therapy.

Introduction

Chromatin  remodeling  is  important  in  gene  expression, 
DNA  repair,  and  replication  (Bishton et al.,  2007).  Methy-
lation  of  promotor  regions  of  tumor  suppressor  genes 
and  histone  deacetylation  lead  to  gene  silencing  (Bishton 
et al.,  2007).  Epigenetic  modification  with  histone  deace-
tylase  inhibitors  and  hypomethylating  agents  allow  upre-
gulation  of  proapoptotic  genes  and  downregulation  of  an-
tiapoptotic  genes,  and  show  significant  single-agent  anti-
cancer  activity  (Bishton et al.,  2007;  Dalgard et al.,  2008). 
Combinations  of  these  drugs  are  being  employed  in  clin-
ical  trials  to  target  multiple  biological  pathways  (Bishton 
et al.,  2007).  Preclinical  studies  of  combinations  of  these 
agents  are  ongoing  and  demonstrate  synergy  in  many 
hematological  cancers  (Bishton et al.,  2007).  But,  the  ex-
act  target  is  still  ambiguous  and  can  not  be  controlled 
precisely.  We  report  the  results  of  our  leukemia  cell  mi-
croarray  profiles  after  epigenetic  combination  therapy.
    There  are  several  reasons  why  both  demethylating 
agents  and  histone  deacetylase  inhibitors  (HDACis)  are 
excellent  candidates  for  examination  as  part  of  combi-
nation  strategies  (Bishton  et al.,  2007).  First,  these 
agents  have  considerable  single-agent  activity  in  hema-
tological  malignancies;  this  activity  is  probably  related  to 
the  modification  of  epigenetic  changes,  leading  to  re-ex-
pression  of  aberrantly  silenced  tumor  suppressor  genes 
(Bishton  et al.,  2007).  However,  the  relatively  low  re-
sponse  of  single  agents  in  myelodysplastic  syndromes 
and  acute  myeloid  leukemia  demonstrates  that  there  are 
numerous  cellular  ‘escape  mechanisms’  that  allow  the 
cell  to  avoid  cell  death  (Bishton et al.,  2007).  Combina-
tion  approaches  with  demethylating  agents  and  HDACis 
that  are  targeted  at  the  epigenome  may  overcome  some 
of  this  resistance.  Second,  a  multitarget  hit  strategy 
seems  to  benefit  cancer  therapy.  As  we  dissect  critical 
cell  cycle,  proliferation,  apoptosis,  angiogenesis,  and 
signaling  pathways,  we  can  develop  molecules  to  target 
them  (Bishton et al.,  2007).  It  is  clear  that  in  addition  to 
the  effect  on  histone  acetylation,  non-histone  targets  are 
critical  for  the  effects  of  these  drugs.  Such  targets  for 
hyperacetylation  include  p53,  α-tubulin,  HIF-1α,  and 
HSP90  (Bali et al.,  2005;  Huang et al.,  2002;  Kawaguchi 
et al.,  2003;  Qian et al.,  2006).  Finally,  the  good  toxicity 
profile  of  these  agents  make  them  suitable  for  combina-

Methods

Cell  lines  &  Cell  culture

The  HL-60  leukemic  cell  line  was  obtained  from  Korean 
Cell  Line  Bank  (KCLB).  Cell  lines  were  cultured  at  37oC 
(5%  CO2)  in  RPMI  1640  medium,  supplemented  with 
10%  fetal  calf  serum  and  1%  penicillin/streptomycin  (all 
purchased  from  Sigma-Aldrich  Co.  Ltd.  Poole,  UK). 

Determination  of  effects  of  drug  combination

5-azacytidine  (12.25μM)  and  0.83μM  scriptaid  were 
used.  A  2-mL  solution  of  control  and  5-azacytidine  2.5
μL,  scriptaid  2.5μL  combination  regimen  were  com-
pared  (Table  1).  Cell  viability  curves  were  drawn  from 
the  combination-treated  cells  (Fig.  1).

WST-1  assay

Cell  number  and  viability  were  further  assessed  by  using 
the  WST-1  reagent  (Roche,  Indianapols,  USA).  This  col-

orimetric  assay  measures  the  metabolic  activity  of  viable 
cells  based  on  cleavage  of  the  tetrazolium  salt  WST-1 
into  formazan  by  mitochondrial  dehydrogenase  in  live 
cells.  Cells  under  different  treatments  were  plated  at 
1×104  cells/0.32  cm2  in  a  96-well  plate  and  were  main-
tained  for  48  hr  at  37oC  in  8.5%  CO2.  Absorbance  read-
ings  were  normalized  against  control  wells  with  medium 
alone.  All  experiments  were  performed  independently  at 
least  3  times  in  triplicate  per  experimental  point. 

RNA  extraction 

Total  RNA  was  isolated  from  cell  lines  using  Nucleospin 
RNA  II  (Macherey-Nagel,  Germany).  RNA  quality  was  as-
sessed  using  a  NanoDrop  ND-1000  (NanoDrop  Technol-
ogies,  Wilmington,  USA)  spectrophotometer.  Extracted 
RNA  was  stored  at  -70oC.
    Total RNA yield was quantified by densitometric assess-
ment of both ribosomal bands using the FlourChem Digital 
Imaging  System  (Alpha  Inotek,  Inc.,  San  Leandro,  CA, 
USA).

Microarray  analysis

The  microarray  hybridization  was  performed  using  the 
Illumina  Gene  Expression  48K  Chip  (Illumina).  Data  visu-
alization,  clustering,  and  differential  analysis  were  car-
ried  out  with  BeadStudio  software  (Illumina)  and  the 
GeneSpring  GX  program,  7.3  (Silicon  Genetics).

Differentially  expressed  genes  in  leukemia  cells 
treated with 5-azacytidine, scriptaid,  or  the  com-
bination  regimen

There  were  78  expressed  genes  after  treatment  with 
5-azacytidine  (Fig.  2,  3).  Ninety-nine  genes  were  ex-
pressed  after  treatment  with  scriptaid  (Fig.  2,  3).  Sixty 
genes  overlapped  between  the  5-azacytidine  treatment 
and  scriptaid  treatment  (Fig.  2).
    After  treatment  with  both  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid, 
which  is  a  combination  of  a  demethylating  agent  and  an 
HDACi,  there  was  a  remarkable  gene  expression  profile 
change  (Fig.  4,  Table  2).  Two  hundred  seventy  newly 
developed  genes  were  expressed  (Fig.  2,  Table  2).  The 
gene  ontology  biological  process  profile  shows  that  of 
these  270  genes,  94  genes  were  associated  with  signal 
transduction  (34.81%),  68  genes  were  associated  with 
immunity  and  defense  (25.19%),  and  35  genes  were  as-
sociated  with  developmental  processes  (12.96%)  (Fig.  4, 
Table  2).  The  gene  ontology  molecular  function  profile 
shows  that  32  genes  were  associated  with  receptors 
(11.85%),  23  genes  were  associated  with  signaling  mol-
ecules  (8.52%),  and  19  genes  were  associated  with  se-
lect  regulatory  molecules  (7.04%)  (Fig.  5,  Table  2).
    We  selected  13  genes  that  showed  higher  fold- 
changes  after  treatment  with  combination  therapy  with 
5-azacytudune  and  scriptaid.  HPGD, CPA3, CEACAM6, 
LOC653907,  ETS1,  RAB37,  PMP22,  FST,  FOXC1,  and 
CCL2  were  up-regulated,  and IGLL3, IGLL1,  and ASS1 
were  down-regulated  (Table  3).

Differentially  expressed  genes  associated  with 
oncogenesis  in  leukemia  cells  treated  with  the

Of  the  270  genes,  11  genes  were  involved  in  onco-
genesis: ETS1, ASCL2, BTG2, BTG1, SLAMF6, CDKN2D, 
RRAS, RET, GIPC1, MAGEB,  and RGL4  (Fig.  2,  Table  4).
    Twenty-nine  genes  remained  unchanged  after  combi-
nation  treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid  (Fig.  2, 
Table  5).  Two  genes  were  involved  in  oncogenesis: 
CCNA1  and  JUN  (Fig.  2,  Table  5).

Discussion

Demethylating  agents,  such  as  5-azacytidine  and  decita-
bine,  are  actively  implicated  in  clinical  practice  to  im-
prove  survival  and  quality  of  life  in  myelodysplastic 
syndrome.  Their  potential  action  on  acute  leukemia  is 
also  being  studied.  HDACis,  such  as  scriptaid  and  val-
proic  acid,  are  also  useful  in  decreasing  leukemia  cells 
(Chavez-Blanco et al.,  2006).  But,  neither  of  these  single 
agent  makes  clinicians  satisfied  as  a  cure  for  acute 
leukemia.  There  are  a  few  studies  that  have  combined 
these  two  epigenetic  therapies  to  reveal  silenced  tumor 
suppressor  genes.  The  dual  epigenetic  therapy  may  in-
duce  positive  or  negative  genetic  alterations  in  leukemia 
cells,  and  the  gene  expression  profile  may  change  a  lot 
after  combining  the  two  epigenetic  therapies--a  deme-
thylating  agent  and  an  HDACi.  There  are  little  data  on 
the  gene  expression  profiles  of  dual  epigenetic  therapy 
so  far. 
    It  is  notable  that  over  two  times  as  many  genes  were 
newly  expressed  after  treatment  with  both  the  demethy-
lating  agent  and  HDACi.  The  newly  expressed  genes 
could  work  positively  or  negatively  on  leukemia  cells. 
So,  before  applying  dual  epigenetic  therapy  to  the  clin-
ical  setting,  target  gene  information  may  help  clinicians 
to  understand  the  mechanisms  of  leukemogenesis  and 
epigenetic  therapy. 
    Our  results  show  that  the  major  portion  of  newly  ex-
pressed  genes  after  combination  treatment  with  5-aza-

duction  pathways  may  be  the  key  to  leukemogenesis 
and  a  cure  for  leukemia.  But,  due  to  the  limitations  of 
cell  line  data,  our  results  can  not  generate  an  answer 
yet.  Further  clinical  confirmation  is  needed.
    HPGD,  hydroxyprostaglandin  dehydrogenase  15,  enc-
odes  a  member  of  the  short-chain  nonmetalloenzyme  al-
cohol  dehydrogenase  protein  family.  The  encoded  en-
zyme  is  responsible  for  the  metabolism  of  prosta-
glandins,  which  function  in  a  variety  of  physiological  and 
cellular  processes,  such  as  inflammation.  Mutations  in 
this  gene  result  in  primary  autosomal  recessive  hyper-
trophic  osteoarthropathy  and  cranioosteoarthropathy.  A 
recent  study  reported  the  association  of  a  risk  of  lung 
cancer  with  an HPGD  SNP  (Wang et al.,  2010).  It  is  in-
versely  correlated  with  VEGF  expression  in  colorectal 
cancer  (Lim  et al.,  2010).  HPGD  is  down-regulated  in 
gastric  cancer  (Thiel  et al.,  2009).  Reduction  of  HPGD 
expression  is  an  independent  predictor  of  poor  survival, 
associated  with  enhanced  cell  proliferation  in  gastric  ad-
enocarcinoma  (Tatsuwaki et al.,  2010).  Down-  regulation 
of HPGD  contributes  to  PGE2  accumulation  in  lung,  co-
lon,  and  pancreatic  cancers  (Pham  et al.,  2010).  But, 
HPGD  protein  level  is  higher  in  malignant  ovarian  tissue 
samples  compared  to  normal  tissue,  which  does  not 
correlate  with  the  former  report  (Thill et al.,  2010). HPGD 
is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combination  treat-
ment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    CPA3,  carboxypeptidase  A3,  encodes  mast  cell  car-
boxypeptidase  A  (Mc-cpa),  which  is  a  highly  conserved 
secretory  granule  protease.  Mc-cpa  plays  a  crucial  role 
in  the  generation  of  phenotypically  mature  mast  cells

The  fold-change  is  the  ratio  of  average  expression  values 
of  combination  treatment  specimens  to  those  of  untreated 
(control)  specimens.  A  positive  and  negative  score  in-
dicates  up-regulation  and  down-regulation  in  the  combina-
tion  regimen-treated  specimens,  respectively.

(Feyerabend et al.,  2005). CPA3  is  up-regulated  in  leu-
kemia  cells  after  combination  treatment  with  5-azacyti-
dine  and  scriptaid.
    Overexpression  of  CEACAM6,  carcinoembryonic  anti-
gen-related  cell  adhesion  molecule  6,  independently  pre-
dicted  poor  overall  survival  in  colorectal  cancer  (Jant-
scheff et al.,  2003).  High  expression  of CEACAM6  mRNA 
was  reported  in  acute  lymphoblastic  leukemias  (Lasa et 
al.,  2008). CEACAM6  is  associated  with  neutrophil  adhe-
sion  to  the  endothelium  and  angiogenesis  (Skubitz  and 
Skubitz  2008).  CEACAM6  is  a  major  target  gene  for 
Smad3-mediated  TGF-beta  signaling  (Han  et al.,  2007). 
There  is  a  report  of  CEACAM6  overexpression  in  bor-
derline  and  invasive  ovarian  neoplasms  (Litkouhi  et al., 
2008). CEACAM6  is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after 
combination  treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    LOC653907  is  similar  to  complement  component 
(3b/4b)  receptor  1  isoform  F  precursor.  It  is  associated 
with  immunity  and  defense.  There  are  some  reports  that 
it  is  associated  with  Alzheimer  disease  or  dementia 
(Bossers  et al.,  2010).  LOC653907  is  up-regulated  in 
leukemia  cells  after  combination  treatment  with  5-azacy-
tidine  and  scriptaid.
    ETS1,  erythroblastosis  virus  E26  oncogene  homolog 
1,  regulates  numerous  genes  and  is  involved  in  stem 
cell  development,  cell  senescence  and  death,  and  tu-
morigenesis  (Russell  and  Garrett-Sinha,  2010).  ETS1  is 
up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combination  treat-
ment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    RAB37  is  a  member  of  the  RAS  oncogene  family.  Rab 
proteins  are  low-molecular-mass  GTPases  that  are  crit-
ical  regulators  of  vesicle  trafficking.  Frequent  down-reg-
ulation  of RAB37  in  lung  cancer  has  been  reported  (Wu 
et al.,  2009).  RAB37  with  renal  cell  cancer  association 
has  also  been  reported  (Dobashi et al.,  2009). RAB37  is 
up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combination  treat-
ment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    PMP22, peripheral myelin protein 22, mediates Schwann 
cell  growth  and  peripheral  myelin  compaction.  Interleu-

kin-6  upregulates  the  expression  of  PMP22  in  cultured 
rat  Schwann  cells  via  a  JAK2-dependent  pathway  (Ito et 
al.,  2010). PMP22  is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after 
combination  treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    FST,  follistatin,  is  a  single-chain  gonadal  protein  that 
specifically  inhibits  follicle-stimulating  hormone  release. 
Overexpression  of  follistatin  in  human  myoblasts  in-
creases  their  proliferation  and  differentiation  and  im-
proves  graft  success  in  SCID  mice  (Benabdallah et al., 
2009). FST  is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combi-
nation  treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
  FOXC1,  forkhead  box  C1,  belongs  to  the  forkhead 
family  of  transcription  factors,  which  are  characterized 
by  a  distinct  DNA-binding  forkhead  domain.  The  specific 
function  of  this  gene  has  not  yet  been  determined;  how-
ever,  it  has  been  shown  to  play  a  role  in  the  regulation 
of  embryonic  and  ocular  development.  Mutations  in  this 
gene  cause  various  glaucoma  phenotypes,  including  pri-
mary  congenital  glaucoma,  autosomal  dominant  iridogo-
niodysgenesis  anomalies,  and  Axenfeld-Rieger  anoma-
lies.  There  is  frequent  aberrant  DNA  methylation  of 
FOXC1  in  breast  cancer  (Muggerud et al.,  2010). FOXC1 
is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combination  treat-
ment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid.
    CCL2,  chemokine  ligand  2,  encodes  a  monocyte  che-
moattractant  protein.  It  is  up-regulated  in  leukemia  cells 
after  combination  treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and 
scriptaid.
    IGLL3,  immunoglobulin  lambda-like  polypeptide  3, 
and  IGLL1,  immunoglobulin  lambda-like  polypeptide  1, 
are  down-regulated  in  leukemia  cells  after  combination 
treatment  with  5-azacytidine  and  scriptaid. ASS1,  argini-
nosuccinate  synthetase  1,  is  also  down-regulated  in  leu-
kemia  cells  after  combination  treatment  with  5-azacyti-
dine  and  scriptaid.
    Among  the  270  genes,  11  genes  are  involved  with 
oncogenesis.  They  could  be  oncogenes  or  tumor  sup-
pressor  genes.  So,  newly  expressed  tumor  suppressor 
genes,  such  as  CDKN2D,  could  function  to  suppress 
hematological  malignancies.  But,  newly  developed  onco-
genes  could  be  the  cause  of  secondary  malignancies  or 
progression  of  existing  hematological  malignancies.
    ASCL2,  achaete-scute  complex  homolog  2,  controls 
intestinal  stem  cell  fate  (van  der  Flier et al.,  2009).  It  is 
a  target  of Wnt  signaling  and  is  upregulated  in  intestinal 
neoplasia  (Jubb  et al.,  2006). 
    BTG2,  B-cell  translocation  gene  2,  is  a  tumor  sup-
pressor  gene  of  medulloblastoma  (Farioli-Vecchioli et al., 
2007). BTG2  plays  a  pivotal  role  in  maintaining  the  hem-
atopoietic  stem  cell  compartment  and  hematopoiesis 
(Kim et al.,  2008). BTG1  is  associated  with  angiogenesis 
(Iwai  et al.,  2004). 
    SLAMF6  is  an  oncogene  associated  with  B  cell  adhe-

Expression  Profile  after  Epigenetic  Combination    191

sion  (Cannons et al.,  2010). CDKN2D,  cyclin-dependent 
kinase  inhibitor  2D  (p19),  and  RRAS,  Harvey  rat  sarco-
ma  oncogene,  subgroup  R,  are  also  up-regulated  in  leu-
kemia  cells  after  combination  treatment  with  5-azacyti-
dine  and  scriptaid.
    Genetic  alterations  in  the  29  genes  that  were  un-
changed  after  treatment  with  both  the  demethylating 
agent  and  HDACi  might  give  us  solutions  to  overcome 
hematological  malignancies.  There  are  two  genes  in-
volved  in  oncogenesis,  CCNA1  and  JUN  (Fig.  1,  Table 
4).  These  two  genes  could  be  the  target  genes  to  over-
come  with  other  chemotherapeutic  agents,  monoclonal 
antibodies,  or  small  molecules  which  cannot  be  con-
trolled  with  epigenetic  therapy.
    There  is  some  evidence  that  combination  strategies 
with  multiple  epigenetic  agents,  such  as  demethylating 
agents  and  HDACis,  show  synergistic  effects  and  bene-
fits  in  hematological  malignancies  (Bishton et al.,  2007; 
Cameron et al.,  1999;  Chavez-Blanco et al.,  2006;  Des-
mond et al.,  2007;  Galm et al.,  2006).  But,  the  lack  of 
long-term  follow-up  of  clinical  data  and  the  exact  genet-
ic  information  after  treatment  with  multiple  epigenetic 
therapy  makes  clinicians  hesitate  in  using  epigenetic 
combination  therapy.  Demethylating  agents,  such  as 
5-azacytidine  and  decitabine,  are  nonselective  hypo-
methylating  agents  that  can  not  selectively  target  specif-
ic  chromosomal  loci.  But,  there  are  synergistic  gene  ex-
pression  changes  after  multiple  epigenetic  therapy,  and 
information  about  the  target  genes  could  be  the  weap-
ons  to  conquer  hematological  malignancies.  There  are 
no  previous  reports  of  microarray  genetic  profiles  after 
treatment  with  both  the  demethylating  agent  5-azacyti-
dine  and  the  HDACi  scriptaid.  We  report  our  results  on 
leukemia  cell  microarray  profiles  after  epigenetic  combi-
nation  therapy  with  the  hope  that  they  are  the  starting 
point  of  selectively  targeted  epigenetic  therapy.
    Nonetheless,  combination  trials  will  need  to  be  de-
signed  carefully,  as  it  is  possible  that  unexpected  tox-
icities  may  be  unearthed.  Transient  thrombocytopenia  is 
a  common  dose-dependent  toxic  effect  of  HDACis, 
which  may  limit  our  ability  to  combine  these  drugs  with 
chemotherapy  (Bishton  et al.,  2007).  Large  randomized 
trials  will  be  required  to  establish  that  combination  ap-
proaches  are  advantageous.
    To  further  our  understanding  of  the  targets  of  these 
epigenetic  agents,  careful  preclinical  studies  of  mecha-
nisms  and  pharmacodynamics  analysis,  incorporated 
within  translational  studies  on  clinical  trials,  are  essen-
tial.  As  our  knowledge  of  the  epigenetic  control  of  gene 
expression  expands,  novel  targets  for  therapeutic  inter-
vention  will  be  identified,  and  new  classes  of  selectively 
targeted  agents  will  be  developed.
