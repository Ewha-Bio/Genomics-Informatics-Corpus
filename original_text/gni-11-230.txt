Study of Modern Human Evolution via Comparative 

Analysis with the Neanderthal Genome

Many other human species appeared in evolution in the last 6 million years that have not been able to survive to modern 
times and are broadly known as archaic humans, as opposed to the extant modern humans. It has always been considered 
fascinating  to  compare  the  modern  human  genome  with  that  of  archaic  humans  to  identify  modern  human-specific 
sequence variants and figure out those that made modern humans different from their predecessors or cousin species. 
Neanderthals are the latest humans to become extinct, and many factors made them the best representatives of archaic 
humans. Even though a number of comparisons have been made sporadically between Neanderthals and modern humans, 
mostly following a candidate gene approach, the major breakthrough took place with the sequencing of the Neanderthal 
genome. The initial genome-wide comparison, based on the first draft of the Neanderthal genome, has generated some 
interesting inferences regarding variations in functional elements that are not shared by the two species and the debated 
admixture question. However, there are certain other genetic elements that were not included or included at a smaller scale 
in those studies, and they should be compared comprehensively to better understand the molecular make-up of modern 
humans and their phenotypic characteristics. Besides briefly discussing the important outcomes of the comparative analyses 
made  so  far  between  modern  humans  and  Neanderthals,  we  propose  that  future  comparative  studies  may  include 
retrotransposons, pseudogenes, and conserved non-coding regions, all of which might have played significant roles during 
the evolution of modern humans.

Introduction

Modern humans are indeed a very young species com-
pared to their cousins, evolving just about 200,000 years ago 
(ya),  which  is  a  fraction  of  the  6  million  years  since  the 
divergence  of  the  human  and  chimpanzee  lineages  [1]. 
Fossils suggest that modern humans first emerged in East 
Africa and spread fairly quickly all over the world in the next 
185,000 years or so (reviewed in Lu et al. [2]). After the 
divergence of humans and chimps, the major landmark in 
human history is the emergence of bipedals about 4 million 
years ago (mya), which enabled them to use their two feet as 
hands. Many species evolved afterwards until the evolution 
of  Homo  erectus,  who,  for  the  first  time,  migrated  out  of 
Southern  Africa  and  initiated  the  spread  of  humans  all 
around the globe. The migrated population of Homo erectus in 
East Africa eventually gave rise to modern humans about 

200,000 ya and to Homo neanderthalensis, or Neanderthals, 
about 400,000 ya [3, 4]. Neanderthals survived until 28,000 
ya, while modern humans are still surviving [5]. During the 
latter part of their existence, Neanderthals lived in Europe, 
as well as in Western Asia and the Middle East [6, 7]. Various 
lines of evidence suggest that modern humans started to 
migrate from East Africa to Europe and other parts of the 
world 100,000 ya, and the fossil evidence of humans and 
Neanderthals indicated that these species might have come 
into contact as early as 80,000 ya and co-habited for up to 
10,000 years at certain geographic locations [6].

In the field of evolutionary biology, one of the most sought 
after questions has been what made modern humans su-
perior than other related species－i.e., the genomic features 
that are unique to humans. The whole-genome sequencing 
of chimps, rhesus macaque, and other primates has given 
considerable boosts in this field, as the sequences of these

primates opened up the possibility to conduct comprehen-
sive comparative studies to the single-nucleotide level [8, 9]. 
Many  attempts  have  been  taken  to  identify  the  genetic 
reasons why modern humans developed such complex bio-
logical  features  than  other  primates,  including  the  larger 
brain-to-body ratio, bipedalism, morphological changes, and 
significant development of communication skills and cog-
nitive behavior. Recent studies have used various statistical 
methods to compare the sequence of these primates with 
humans in an attempt to find human-specific genes and gene 
regulatory sequences, eventually showing unexpectedly ra-
pid evolution in the human lineage after the divergence from 
the  ancestral  primates  [10-15].  The  results  from  these 
analyses  exhibit  a  good  overview  of  the  human-specific 
genomic elements, but these results are unable to distin-
guish which of these human-specific elements are specific to 
modern  humans  only.  Since  there  has  been  no  complete 
genome sequence of any archaic humans until recently, such 
sequence comparisons have been made only between the 
modern human genome and other primates, bypassing ar-
chaic  humans,  resulting  in  an  overwhelming  number  of 
differences  and  the  inability  to  identify  which  sequences 
changes are unique to modern humans and which are shared 
by  all  Homo  species.  Therefore,  the  comparative  analysis 
between modern humans and archaic humans is expected to 
be more interesting and valuable by being more effective in 
identifying  the  critical  genes  and/or  regulatory  elements 
that may be fully or partially responsible for the evolution of 
the modern humans over other humans.

In order to identify such sequence changes, the modern 
human genome sequence must be compared with that of 
archaic humans. Neanderthals have always been a desired 
target for this purpose for multiple reasons. They are the 
closest cousins of modern humans, both anatomically and 
based on intelligence. Their slightly larger brain and wider 
body structure are the primary anatomical differences from 
the  modern  humans  [16].  Fossil  evidence  suggests  that 
Neanderthals used stone tools, they were hunter gatherers, 
and they had a social life, indicating that they had similar 
intelligence as modern humans until about 50,000 ya, when 
a “Creative explosion” occurred in modern humans [17, 18]. 
Another critical reason to target Neanderthals is that they 
are the latest archaic humans to go extinct, and their remains 
have been found in sufficiently good condition for analyzing 
down to the molecular level [19-21]. To make a compre-
hensive genomic comparison between modern and archaic 
humans, the whole genome of archaic humans has to be 
sequenced. The availability and widespread use of massively 
parallel  high-throughput  sequencing  have  now  made  it 
possible to sequence archaic genomes, which seemed impos-
sible even a decade ago. The idea of sequencing an ancient 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

genome was first implemented on cave bear [22] and, after 
its success, the mammoth genome [23]. The initial sequen-
cing attempts on Neanderthals included sequencing of the 
mitochondrial genome, which was successful to a certain 
extent  [24-26].  These  successes  eventually  led  paleoge-
neticists to attempt sequencing Neanderthal nuclear geno-
mes.  Almost  all of  the  attempts  have been made  by  am-
plifying the genome fragments via PCR and parallel sequen-
cing, while some involve the use of a metagenomic approach. 
The  early  success  of  such  attempts  eventually  led  to  the 
establishment of the Neanderthal Genome Project in 2005, 
which first announced the complete genome sequence of 
Neanderthals in 2010 [27] and recently released a cleaner 
and higher-coverage version (http://www.eva.mpg.de/nean
dertal/). Comprehensive comparisons have been made by 
the  group  on  certain  genetic  entities  with  some  very  in-
teresting inferences, based on the initial low-coverage se-
quencing data, but improvements in many aspects can be 
made by utilizing the recent, better version of the sequence 
and considering more types of genetic variances in the study. 
Here, we will discuss the inferences made from the com-
parison and what can be done next to answer some inte-
resting  questions  regarding  the  evolution  of  modern 
humans.

Why  Whole  Genome  Sequence  of  Nean-
derthals?

Many  lines  of  archaeological  evidence  indicate  that 
humans  and  Neanderthals  may  have  coexisted  in  certain 
geographic locations. This gives rise to the most debatable 
question  regarding  the  recent  history  of  humans:  did 
modern humans and Neanderthals interbreed? If they did, 
was it to an extent where meaningful exchange of genetic 
information may have occurred? Do we still carry any genetic 
elements  of  Neanderthals?  Comparing  the  genome  se-
quences is probably the best way to answer all these que-
stions. All other features, including the level of intelligence 
in  Neanderthals,  have  been  speculated  from  bones, 
settlements, or artifacts found, and there is no way to be 
certain about the practicality or validity of the inferences 
made from these remains. The hypothesis that Neanderthals 
were  able  to  practice  complex  behavior  has  already  been 
disputed [28-30]. There has also been a significant amount 
of debate about the admixture of humans and Neanderthals. 
Morphological  analyses  have  provided  strong  arguments 
both for and against the genetic exchange between these two 
species [31, 32], as have the comparative analyses of DNA 
sequences of these species [33-35]. The genome sequence 
itself can not validate many of these inferences, either, but it 
can  answer  the  question  of  admixture  and  articulate  the

M  Ahmed  and  P  Liang.  Neanderthal  Genome  and  Modern  Human  Evolution

genetic  elements  that  are  unique  to  Neanderthals  or  to 
humans or those that are shared by both. Studies on the 
expression  or  protein  functions  in  association  with  these 
unique  elements,  despite  being  plausible  only  for  those 
found  in  the  human  genome,  can  eventually  facilitate 
analysis of complex biological phenomena, such as reaso-
ning, language, or other qualitative or behavioral traits, at 
the molecular level.

In the past, a candidate gene approach has been success-
fully implemented to identify the presence or variance of 
certain  genes  that  were  believed  to  be  modern  human- 
specific.  Using  this  approach,  a  number  of  speculations 
about Neanderthals could be made, including their skin and 
hair color. It was also discovered that Neanderthals had the 
same FOXP2 gene as modern humans, which was previously 
linked to language ability [36]. This approach of fishing for 
particular genes proved efficient, but there is a lot more than 
known genes in the whole genome that may play a critical 
regulatory role in gene expression and thus development. 
For instance, almost half of the human genome consists of 
transposable  elements;  these  elements  can  affect  gene 
expression by activating or deactivation functional genetic 
elements  and  by  altering  the  protein  coding  by  creating 
alternative splicing or creating new chimeric genes ([37-39], 
reviewed  in  [40,  41]).  Transposable  elements  are  also 
polymorphic  among  different  populations  of  modern 
humans, and their association with phenotypic traits, inclu-
ding diseases, has been extensively studied, albeit with a lot 
more to be learned [42-44]. The whole-genome sequence is 
necessary  for  identifying  transposable  element  insertions 
that  may  have  taken  place  only  in  modern  humans  and 
subsequently assessing their functional impact. 

Comparative analysis

The only part of the Neanderthal genome that was se-
quenced completely from multiple specimens until recently 
was the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The major analysis 
that was made with the mtDNA sequence was to seek an 
answer to the question of interbreeding. The Neanderthal 
mtDNA sequence consistently falls outside the spectrum of 
variations observed in the modern human mtDNA sequen-
ce, indicating no interbreeding between the species [24-26, 
45, 46]. Previously, besides detecting specific mutations in 
MCPH1  and  FOXP2,  the  candidate  gene  approach  also 
detected the presence of fragments of the MC1R gene that 
may indicate the red hair and pale skin of Neanderthals [47], 
segments of the ABO blood group locus [48], and a taste 
receptor  gene  [49].  Despite  many  critical  technical  chal-
lenges in sequencing ancient genomes ([26]; reviewed in 
[50]),  the  whole  genome  of  Neanderthals  has  been  se-
quenced recently by Green et al. [27], and it allowed this 

research group to perform a genome-wide sequence com-
parison with the modern human genome sequence, and the 
significant  results  from  the  initial  analyses  are  discussed 
briefly below.

Substitutions and indels

Green et al. [27] inferred that 10,535,445 substitutions 
and  479,863  indels  have  occurred  in  the  modern  human 
genome after the divergence from chimps. The vast majority 
of these occurred before Neanderthals and modern humans 
diverged.  However,  78  non-synonymous  nucleotide  sub-
stitutions that are fixed for a derived state in modern humans 
are  different  in  the  Neanderthal  counterpart,  as  Nean-
derthals  carry  the  ancestral  state  of  these  polymorphic 
nucleotides. Only five genes were identified that have more 
than one fixed substitution in their coding regions, and one 
of them has an altered start or stop codon. It is particularly 
interesting that three of these genes are expressed in skin, 
including  RPTN,  which  encodes  the  protein  repetin,  and 
TRPMI, which encodes melastatin. This might be indicative 
of a change in selection of skin physiology in the modern 
human lineage. When looking into differences in regulatory 
elements, a total of 132 substitutions and 36 indels were 
identified  in  the  untranslated  regions.  One  microRNA  of 
unknown function, hsa-mir-1304, which was identified by 
parallel sequencing  of  human embryonic stem cells  [51], 
was  found  to  have  one  fixed  substitution  and  one  single 
nucleotide insertion. Since  the  substitution  occurs in the 
seed  region,  it  is  not  unlikely  that  this  microRNA  has 
different targets between these two species.

Selective sweeps in modern humans

There  are  212  positively  selected  regions  identified  in 
modern humans that occurred early during the history in 
conjunction  with  or  shortly  after  their  divergence  from 
Neanderthals. The largest of the positively selected regions 
contains  the  gene  THADA,  single-nucleotide  polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of which have been linked with 
type  II  diabetes  [52].  This  change  may  have  affected  the 
energy metabolism of early modern humans. A number of 
other genes that lie on these selectively swept regions have 
been associated with other genetic disorders, such as autism, 
schizophrenia, and Down syndrome. Since both autism and 
schizophrenia are related to cognitive development, it could 
be  assumed  that  multiple  genes  involved  in  cognitive 
development in humans were positively selected early in the 
history of modern humans.

Admixture

Even though previous studies with Neanderthal mtDNA 
[26, 33] and initial sequencing of nuclear DNA showed no 

232

evidence  of  interbreeding  between  Neanderthals  and  hu-
mans  [21,  53],  the  most  striking  revelation  after  the 
comparative analyses between the whole-genome sequence 
of  Neanderthals  and  multiple  modern  human  individual 
genomic  sequences  was  the  demonstration  of  admixture 
between these two species. Green et al. [27] compared the 
Neanderthal genome with eight modern-day human geno-
mes of European Americans, East Asians, and West African 
ancestry.  Surprisingly,  the  Neanderthal  genome  appeared 
more  similar  to  all  non-African  genomes  than  to  African 
ones. They share significantly more derived alleles (alleles 
that are different from in chimp) with non-African popu-
lations  than  with  the  African,  and  when  compared  with 
European and Asian individual genomes, Neanderthals are 
found  equally  close  to  both  populations.  This  and  some 
other analyses made by the group only indicate an exchange 
of DNA between Neanderthals and the non-African popu-
lation. With further comparative analysis, the same group 
also identified that gene flow occurred unidirectionally from 
Neanderthals to the modern non-African human population.
A couple of  other findings  from  different experiments, 
along  with  a  genome-wide  comparison,  provide  strong 
evidence  for  exchange  of  genetic  information.  The  first 
finding involves the MAPT locus in chromosome 17, which 
has two distinct haplotypes, H1 and H2. H1 is abundant in 
almost all populations of modern humans, while H2 is found 
only among Europeans and found to have entered into the 
Homo  lineage  approximately  only  10,000  to  30,000  ya. 
However,  a  comparison  between  H1  and  H2  in  chimp 
suggests that the common founder of H1 and H2 is far older 
than 30,000 years. Even though the Neanderthal genome 
sequence  has  been  found  to  carry  the  H1  haplotype,  co- 
inhabitation of the H2 chromosome carriers during the time 
period  when  modern  humans  coexisted  with  archaic  hu-
mans can not be ruled out because of the scarcity of archaic 
genome data. Thus, one can still argue that the H2 haplotype 
found  in  modern  humans  could  possibly  be  a  result  of 
horizontal  gene  transfer  between  modern  humans  and 
Neanderthals  and  remained  in  modern  humans  under 
selective pressure, possibly because the H1 haplotype has a 
role in neurodegenerative diseases [54]. In a similar sce-
nario, haplotype D of the microcephalin gene is found to 
have  originated  1.1  mya  in  a  lineage  other  than  modern 
humans but integrated into the modern human genome only 
about  37,000  ya.  It  has  thus  been  speculated  that  this 
haplotype was horizontally transferred into modern humans 
from archaic humans, most likely Neanderthals [34]. How-
ever, in a more recent study, the microcephalin locus from a 
Neanderthal individual in Italy was sequenced and found to 
be homozygous for the ancestral non-D haplotype [55]. The 
whole-genome study by Green et al. [27] does not support 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

these  speculations,  either,  since  the  Neanderthals  they 
analyzed do not carry these D-haplotypes.

One  striking  revelation  from  the  whole-genome  com-
parison by Green et al. [27] is the equal level of similarity of 
the  Neanderthal  genome  with  Papuan  and  Chinese  and 
French, although fossil records show the existence of Nean-
derthals  only  in  Europe  and  western  Asia.  The  group 
explained  this anomaly  by arguing  that the interbreeding 
between  the  species  occurred  earlier  than  previously  ex-
pected, before the divergence of Europeans, East Asians, and 
Papuans.  Archaeological  evidence  suggests  that  modern 
humans  appeared  in  the  Middle  East  before  100,000  ya, 
where  Neanderthals  were  already  present,  and  probably 
remained until 50,000 ya [56]; this makes the prediction by 
Green et al. [27] probable.

Future Directions
Increasing coverage, sequencing more Neanderthals, 
and the Y chromosome

For a more comprehensive comparison of whole-genome 
sequences between Neanderthals and modern humans, the 
sequence coverage of Neanderthals has to be increased. The 
three approaches made so far to sequence the Neanderthal 
genome have resulted in the sequencing of only 65,000 bases 
[21],  1  million  bases  [19],  and  finally,  the  draft  genome 
sequenced recently [27], consisting of only two-thirds of the 
whole genome with a mere 1.3× coverage. With such low 
coverage,  it  is  hard  to  form  meaningful  contigs,  and  a 
number of important genetic entities will remain unnoticed. 
Even  though  it  was  beyond  imagination  to  sequence  a 
Pleistocene specimen a decade ago, the progress that has 
been made in the last 5 years is good enough to expect that 
more such specimens be sequenced in coming years. The 
more specimens from various geographic locations that are 
sequenced, the more likely it will be to construct a reference 
genome sequence for Neanderthals. As the human genome 
sequence varies considerably among different populations, it 
is expected that Neanderthals also have variation in their 
genomic  sequences  among  different  populations  from 
different locations. Such variations can only be identified by 
sequencing a wide range of specimens, and these variations 
may  again  change  insights  into  the  Neanderthal-modern 
human relationship. 

The  sequencing  of  Neanderthals  first  started  with  its 
mitochondrial  DNA  in  1997  [25].  Comparisons  between 
Neanderthal and modern human mitochondrial DNA have 
been made extensively, but these comparisons only reveal 
the maternally inherited difference between the species, as 
mitochondria DNA is transmitted maternally. The complete 
genomic sequence of Neanderthals published recently is also

M  Ahmed  and  P  Liang.  Neanderthal  Genome  and  Modern  Human  Evolution

from  a  female  specimen.  Thus,  the  Y-chromosome  of 
Neanderthals or paternal inheritance has yet to be examined. 
Comparisons  of  the  Y  chromosome  sequence  of  Nean-
derthals with currently established Y-haplogroups for mo-
dern humans should provide some insights into the admix-
ture hypothesis. With respect to the recent finding of ad-
mixture of Neanderthals with non-African populations, the 
Neanderthal  Y  chromosome  should  not  match  the  Y 
haplogroups A or B, as these haplogroups are the oldest of 
the clades and almost restricted to Africans and their des-
cendants [57, 58]. Since haplogroup E is found in Africa, the 
Middle  East,  Southern  Europe,  and  Asia  [59-61],  the 
Neanderthal Y chromosome may match this haplogroup, but 
it  should  not  match  the  haplogroups  E1b1a*,  E2b1,  or 
B2a1a, as they are specifically treated as Bantu expansion 
markers,  while  Neanderthals  interbred  only  with  non- 
Africans [62, 63].

Retrotransposon insertion polymorphism

Almost half of the human genome comprises retrotran-
sposons. Although they were overlooked for a significant 
period  of  time  in  our  genetic  study,  their  importance  in 
chromosome  structure,  gene  regulation,  and  disease  pre-
disposition has now been well established. Retroelements 
are  widely  divided  into  two  categories－one  with  long 
terminal  repeats  (LTRs)  and  another  without  the  LTRs. 
Short  and  long  interspersed  repeat  elements  (SINEs  and 
LINEs, respectively) are two of the major classes of non-LTR 
retroelements, while SINEs are the more abundant class. 
Among SINEs, Alu is the predominant type of retroelement. 
Among all Alus found in the entire human genome, only 
about 0.5% is found to be present in the human genome but 
absent in orthologous regions of other primates and are thus 
identified as human-specific. This ‘young’ group of Alus is 
composed of only about 5,000 Alu elements that are believed 
to have integrated in the human genome after the divergence 
of  humans  and  great  apes  [64-68].  Studying  the  retro-
transposon insertion loci in Neanderthals will identify truly 
modern  human-specific  retrotransposon  insertion  poly-
morphisms.  A  similar  comparative  analysis  would  reveal 
other transposable elements, such as L1, SVAs, and HERVs, 
that are specific to modern humans only, as well as those that 
are specific to Neanderthals. Retroelements are particularly 
important in population genetics. It is extremely rare that a 
newly inserted transposable element is completely excised; 
thus, they act as a genetic fossil that is homoplasy-free. This 
identical-by-descent  nature  of  retroelements  makes  them 
better markers for population and evolutionary studies than 
SNPs, in the sense that SNPs can, though rarely, be mutated 
back to the previous state. SNPs are also very hard to detect 
while handling ancient genomes due to transformation and 

deamination  [69],  while  retrotransposon  insertion  poly-
morphisms  (RIPs)  refer  to  the  presence  or  absence  of  a 
retrotransposon. Once a retrotransposon is inserted at a new 
location in an individual, it is subject to genetic drift. Over a 
short  period,  it  starts  spreading  in  to  the  population. 
Depending  on  when  a  retroelement  has  integrated  at  a 
certain  locus,  it  will  be  shared  by  different  species  or,  if 
recently  enough,  by  different  populations  of  the  same 
species.  Thus,  RIPs  occurring  before  the  divergence  of 
chimps and humans are shared by humans and chimps, but 
those occurring after are present only in humans. RIPs that 
are  even  more  recent  are  specific  to  certain  human  po-
pulations only [70, 71]. For instance, some RIPs are found 
only  in  Africans,  some  in  Han  Chinese,  and  so  on.  The 
detailed information about all polymorphic retroelements 
and their frequency in different populations is extensively 
cataloged  in  the  dbRIP  database  [43].  The  identical- 
by-descent and homoplasy-free nature of RIPs makes them 
useful  genetic  markers  in  population  and  evolutionary 
genetics. The specificity of RIPs can play a significant role in 
answering the question of admixture of Neanderthals and 
modern  humans.  Finding  RIPs  that  are  shared  between 
Neanderthals and non-African populations but not present 
in African populations can be considered solid support for 
the  proposed  admixture  between  Neanderthals  and  non- 
African populations. In an ongoing study in our laboratory, 
over 500 RIPs were identified to be present in Khoisan and 
Bantu  individuals,  who  represent  the  oldest  lineage  of 
modern  humans  from  Southern  Africa,  but  not  in  the 
reference  human  genome  (unpublished).  These  oldest 
African  lineage-specific  RIPs  theoretically  should  also  be 
absent from Neanderthals. 

Human-specific unprocessed pseudogenes

Pseudogenization  has  always  been  an  interesting  topic 
that has not been explored much. Many pseudogenes have 
been identified lately that lost their functional capacity in 
human lineage after the divergence of humans and chimps, 
particularly related to immunological functions [72]. The 
“less is more” hypothesis states that gene loss may direct 
evolutionary changes, as these pseudogenized genes have 
impacts on adaptation of the species through evolution [73]. 
Even  though  pseudogenization  does  not  initiate  under 
selective  pressure,  the  gene  loss  is  retained  and  subse-
quently  allows  adaptation.  Pseudogenes  are  found  parti-
cularly important in humans, and some of them have even 
been  identified  as  being  responsible  for  certain  human- 
specific  phenotypes.  For  example,  the  sarcomeric  myosin 
gene was lost at the time of emergence of the genus Homo and 
is  thought  to  be  responsible  for  marked  reduction  of 
hominin masticatory muscles, leading to expansion of brain

size [74]. Analyzing pseudogenes in Neanderthals would be 
beneficial to identify genes that were lost after the diver-
gence of Neanderthals and modern humans and determine 
what biological impact they may have.

Human accelerated conserved noncoding sequences 
(HACNSs)

HACNSs are sequences in the human genome that were 
conserved  throughout  vertebrate  history  but  changed 
significantly  after  the  divergence  of  humans  and  chimps. 
Human  genomes  have  a  number  of  such  sequences  that 
obtained surprisingly more mutations after the emergence of 
humans  than  before.  These  regions  are  typically  rich  in 
cis-regulatory transcriptional enhancers that render specific 
expression pattern of genes involved during development 
[75-77]. Identification of these cis-regulatory elements in 
human  or  other  large  genomes  is  done  mostly  by  cross- 
species sequence comparison, primarily because the func-
tional cis-regulatory elements are generally unique to the 
genome, which makes paralogy-based identification of such 
sequences  nearly impossible  [78]. Since  it has  long  been 
proposed  that  phenotypic  variation  between  humans  and 
chimps is mostly brought about by regulatory elements than 
coding sequences [79], it would be particularly interesting to 
make  an  elaborated  comparison  between  differences  in 
conserved  regions  in  modern  humans  and  Neanderthals. 
Such a comparison between the human genome and initial 
Neanderthal draft genome sequence [27], involving a total of 
2,613  human  accelerated  regions,  revealed  that  the 
Neanderthal sequence carried 3,259 human-specific changes 
in these regions. The comparison revealed that 51 positions 
in  45  regions  were  different  between  these  two  species; 
Neanderthals carried the ancestral form while all modern 
humans carry the human-specific variant. In a recent study, 
it has been found that the Neanderthal genome retains the 
ancestral  state  of  a  polymorphic  site  in  a  conserved 
noncoding microRNA, which is involved in regulating two 
genes that are important for teeth formation [80]. This may 
explain the dental differences between modern humans and 
Neanderthals.  These  findings  are  interesting  enough  to 
initiate further studies to analyze the probable impact of the 
variations in conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) that 
exist between these two species. Furthermore, previously in 
three different studies, the number of HACNSs was found to 
be between 202 and 1175 [10, 11, 15]. All these studies used 
different  methods  to  identify  CNSs  and  included  more 
species during the comparison. Their data can also be in-
cluded in the future for the comparison of CNSs between 
modern  humans  and  Neanderthals.  The  most  rapidly 
evolving  HACNS  identified  so  far,  named  HACNS1,  has 
accumulated 16 human-specific changes out of its 546 bases 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

since the divergence of humans and chimps [12]. HACNS1 
functions  in  multiple  structures  early  in  the  developing 
stages of the mouse embryo as a transcriptional enhancer, 
including  the  developing  anterior  limb  [12].  But,  this 
function is missing for the orthologous enhancers in chim-
panzee and rhesus, suggesting that HACNS1 has a different 
function in humans. When the chimpanzee enhancers are 
humanized  by  introducing  13  of  the  16  human-specific 
substitutions,  gene  expression  was  observed  in  the  limb, 
indicating  that  the  substitutions  that  were  identified  by 
comparative  analysis  were  directly  responsible  for  the 
functional modification. In a recent study, 16 human-specific 
mutations  in  HACNS1  were  also  found  in  Neanderthals, 
suggesting that the phenotypic function that is related to this 
region  was  also  expressed  in  Neanderthals  [81].  The 
comparison  can  be  extended  to  other  human  accelerated 
CNS regions to identify any substitutions that occurred after 
the divergence of humans from Neanderthals.

Conserved  regions  have  also  been  presumed  to  play 
important roles in developing certain functions in humans－
for instance, noncoding regions of 150 presynaptic genes in 
humans are highly conserved and may have critical regu-
latory  roles  in  the  expression  of  these  genes  [82].  Com-
parative analyses of these regions between different popu-
lations  of  modern  humans  and  Neanderthals  may  give 
directions to a better understanding of neurodevelopmental 
and  psychiatric  disorders.  Involvement  of  noncoding  se-
quences in the developing brain was also revealed by another 
experiment involving 49 human accelerated regions (HARs); 
the most accelerated region in the human genome, HAR1, is 
part  of  a  noncoding  RNA  sequence  expressed  in  the 
developing  brain  [83].  A  study  by  Burbano  et  al.  [83] 
identified that 8.3% of HAR substitutions are not shared 
between modern humans and Neanderthals, but the study 
did not focus on HAR1. A complete Neanderthal genomic 
sequence  should  provide  an  understanding  of  the  evolu-
tionary origin of these regulatory RNAs.

Conclusion

Despite  many  technical  challenges,  the  whole-genome 
sequence for a Homo species other than modern human is 
now  there  for  the  first  time  in  just  five  years  of  the 
establishment of the project. It is no longer a question of the 
possibility  of  sequencing  more  genomes  from  archaic  re-
mains, and more such achievements will only strengthen our 
understanding of human evolution. All of our knowledge on 
human species-specific genetic elements thus far is based on 
comparison  with  non-human  primates,  which  gives  us 
information only on how humans are different from other 
primates, such as chimpanzee－not how modern humans

excelled  from  archaic  humans.  Modern  humans  are  con-
siderably superior to their predecessors, and the availability 
of high-quality Neanderthal sequences can shed some light 
on the genetic basis of this phenomenon. An initial com-
parison between the genome sequences of these two species 
has given us some valuable insight, and more studies are 
being  conducted  to  identify  further  variations  between 
Neanderthal  and  humans.  However,  a  lot  remains  to  be 
done, which has been discussed in this article, albeit briefly. 
Even though the sequence comparison itself can not provide 
much confidence on the biological differences between the 
Homo  species,  the  application  of  reverse  genetics  can  be 
initiated  from  this  point  to  speculate  and  validate  the 
possible  biological  effects  of  such  sequence  differences. 
Once  the  molecular  functions  of  such  differences  are 
identified in an in vitro analysis, they can be administered 
into  mouse  models  to  observe  the  phenotypic  results  of 
these  changes.  One  such  experiment  has  already  been 
implemented by administering a human version of FOXP2 in 
the  mouse  genome  to  observe  its  effects  [84].  Many 
behavioral and qualitative traits of humans can be under-
stood at the molecular level using similar approaches. There 
has also been hype by the media over resurrecting Nean-
derthals by modifying the chimpanzee genome to be more 
Neanderthal-like [85]. But, it is still an impossible task to 
regenerate a species just from the genomic sequence, even if 
the  ethical  issues  can  be  resolved  [86].  However,  Nean-
derthals do not have to be reincarnated to provide us with an 
enormous opportunity in the field of human genetics and 
evolution, as their genome is already offering a lot to better 
our understanding of ourselves.
