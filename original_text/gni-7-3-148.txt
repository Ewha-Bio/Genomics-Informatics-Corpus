Abstract

Generally,  larger  sample  size  leads  to  a  greater  stat-
istical  power  to  detect  a  significant  difference.  We  may 
increase  the  sample  size  for  both  case  and  control  in 
order  to  obtain  greater  power.  However,  it  is  often  the 
case  that  increasing  sample  size  for  case  is  not  feasible 
for  a  variety  of  reasons.  In  order  to  look  at  change  in 
power  as  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  varies  (1:1  to  4:1), 
we  conduct  association  tests  with  simulated  data  gen-
erated  by  PLINK.  The  simulated  data  consist  of  50  dis-
ease  SNPs  and  300  non-disease  SNPs  and  we  compute 
powers  for  disease  SNPs.  Genetic  Power  Calculator  was 
used  for  computing  powers  with  varying  the  ratio  of 
control  to  case  (1:1,  2:1,  3:1,  4:1).  In  this  study,  we 
show  that  gains  in  statistical  power  resulting  from  in-
creasing  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  are  substantial  for 
the  simulated  data.  Similar  results  might  be  expected 
for  real  data.

Introduction

The  power  of  a  study  is  the  probability  that  the  test  will 
reject  a  null  hypothesis  that  is  in  fact  false.  As  power 
increases,  the  probability  of  a  Type  II  error  (false  neg-
ative  rate  =β)  decreases  (Fig.  1).  Therefore  power  is  1-
β.  Decreasing  β error  is  equivalent  to  increasing  stat-
istical  power  (Fig.  2). 
    Power  depends  on  several  factors  such  as  preva-
lence,  magnitude  of  effect,  sample  size,  and  required 
level  of  statistical  significance  α.  When  computing  stat-
istical  power  in  matched  case-control  studies  (Dupont, 
1988),  we  need  to  know  a  pre-specified  type  I  error 
rate,  the  ratio  of  control  to  case,  estimated  number  of 
cases,  the  prevalence  of  exposure  in  the  control  group, 

minimum  odds  ratio  declared  to  be  significant  and  cor-
relation  coefficient  for  exposure  between  cases  and  their 
matched  controls.  Hennessy  S  described  the  effect  of 
increasing  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  for  different  val-
ues  of  correlation  coefficients  and  prevalence  among 
controls  in  matched  case-control  studies  (Hennessy  S et 
al.,  1999).  For  a  detailed  review  of  power  and  sample 
size  computation  in  either  genetic  studies  or  genetic  ep-
idemiology,  please  refer  to  Shork  et al.  (2002),  Ambro-
sius et al.  (2004),  De  La  Vega et al.  (2005),  and  Burton 
et al.  (2009).  In  our  study,  we  may  focus  on  how  sample 
size  affects  statistical  power,  given  a  set  of  population 
parameters.
    Generally,  increase  in  sample  size  for  both  case  and 
control  leads  to  increase  in  statistical  power.  There  are 
some  situations,  however,  where  increasing  sample  size 
for  case  is  not  available.  For  example,  in  rare  diseases, 
the  cost  of  including  additional  controls  is  low  whereas 
that  of  including  cases  is  high.  In  such  instances,  we  in-
crease  sample  size  for  control  only  and  then  see  if  the 
effect  on  statistical  power  is  the  same  as  that  obtained 
when  the  sample  size  for  both  case  and  control 
increases.  Specifically,  we  examine  if  increase  in  the  ra-
tio  of  control  to  case  has  an  effect  on  increasing  power. 
We  simulate  SNP  data  as  below  and  assess  the  effect 
of  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  on  statistical  power.

Methods

PLINK  (Purcell et al.,  2007)  was  used  for  generating  si-
mulated  data  with  50  disease  SNPs  and  300  non-dis-
ease  SNPs  (Table  1).  In  this  data,  we  fixed  the  sample 
size  for  case  as  50  but  the  sample  size  for  control  size 
varies  from  50,  100,  150  to  200  in  order  to  investigate 
the  effect  of  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  on  power.  We 
set  prevalence  as  0.5000,  0.3333,  0.2500,  and  0.2000 
for  four  models,  respectively.  First,  assuming  allele  mod-
el,  we  computed  the  number  of  significant  SNPs  for  dis-
ease  SNPs,  non-disease  SNPs,  and  overall  SNPs  as  the 
ratio  of  control  to  case  changes.  We  also  computed  the 
estimated  average  power  which  is  equal  to E(S)/m  (eq1), 
where  S  is  the  number  of  SNPs  declared  to  be  sig-
nificant  among  disease  SNPs  and  m  is  the  number  of 
disease  SNPs.  Second,  we  examined  the  power  for 
each  disease  SNP  using  Genetic  Power  Calculator 
(Purcell  S  et al.,  2003)  in  order  to  see  how  change  in 
the  ratio  of  control  to  case  affects  the  power  for  the  ge-
netic  models  (allele,  genotype,  dominant,  and  recessive).

Results  and  Discussion

Table  2  shows  that  the  number  of  significant  SNPs  in-
creases  as  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  for  allele  model 
rises  from  1:1  to  3:1.  The  increase  in  the  ratio  of  control

model].

to  case  for  disease  SNPs  leads  to  increase  in  number 
of  significant  SNPs,  while  the  increase  in  the  ratio  of 
control  to  case  for  non-disease  SNPs  leads  to  decrease 
in  the  number.  Therefore,  the  number  of  significant 
SNPs  decreases  when  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  in-
creases  from  3:1  to  4:1.  We  might  expect  that  the  gain 
in  average  power  shown  in  eq1  increases  as  the  ratio 
of  control  to  case  increases,  since  the  effect  of  the  ratio 
of  control  to  case  for  disease  SNPS  on  the  number  of 
significant  SNPs  is  substantial.  Assuming  allele  model, 
the  average  power  shown  in  eq1  increases  for  disease 
SNPs  as  the  ratio  of  control  to  case  increases  (Fig.  3). 
In  other  words,  the  power  curve  tends  to  increase 
gradually. 
    On  the  other  hand,  in  regard  to  computing  statistical 
power  for  each  disease  SNP,  for  example,  the  disease 
SNP  3  (Fig.  4)  is  on  the  increase  for  all  models.  The  dis-
ease  SNP  17,  the  power  increases  for  all  models  except 
dominant  model  (Fig.  5).  The  SNP  30  (Fig.  6)  is  on  the 
increase  for  all  models.  The  disease  SNP  34  has  the  in-
creasing  pattern  except  recessive  model  (Fig.  7).  The 
SNP  45  (Fig.  8)  is  on  the  increase  for  all  models.    We

given  other  factors  such  as  prevalence,  magnitude  of  ef-
fect,  and  required  level  of  statistical  significance  α,  sig-
nificant  increase  in  statistical  power  can  be  obtained  by 
increasing  the  ratio  of  control  to  case.  Henceforth,  in-
vestigators  conducting  such  a  study  where  cases  are 
limited  might  consider  increase  in  the  ratio  of  control  to 
case.  Further  investigation  may  be  needed  for  real  data. 
And  other  factors  which  affect  the  power  need  to  be 
considered.
