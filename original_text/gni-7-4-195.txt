Abstract

BIRC5  (Survivin)  belongs  to  the  inhibitor  of  apoptosis 
gene  family.  The  BIRC5  protein  inhibits  caspases  and 
consequently  blocks  apoptosis.  Thus,  BIRC5  contributes 
to  the  progression  of  cancer  allowing  for  continued  cell 
proliferation  and  survival.  In  this  study,  we  identified 
eight  sequence  variants  of  BIRC5  through  direct  DNA 
sequencing.  Among  the  eight  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNPs),  six  common  variants  with  frequen-
cies  higher  than  0.05  were  selected  for  larger-scale  gen-
otyping  (n=1,066).  Results  of  the  study  did  not  show 
any  association  between  the  promoter  region  poly-
morphisms  and  the  clearance  of  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV) 
infection  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  occurr-
ence.  This  is  in  line  with  a  previous  study  in  which  poly-
morphisms  in  the  promoter  region  does  not  influence 
the  function  of  BIRC5.  Initially,  we  were  able  to  detect 
a  signal  with  the ＋9194A＞G,  which  disappeared  after 
multiple  corrections  but  led  to  a  change  in  amino  acid. 
Similarly,  we  were  also  able  to  detect  an  association 
signal  between  two  haplotypes  (haplotype-2  and  hap-
lotype-5)  on  the  onset  age  of  HCC  and/or  HCC  occur-
rence,  but  the  signals  also  disappeared  after  multiple 
corrections.  As  a  result,  we  concluded  that  there  was 
no  association  between  BIRC5  polymorphisms  and  the 
clearance  HBV 
infection  and/or  HCC  occurrence. 
However,  our  results  might  useful  to  future  studies.

Introduction

Hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  infection,  one  of  the  most  com-
mon  virus  infections  among  humans,  is  the  major  cause 
of  acute  and  chronic  liver  diseases  (Lin  and  Kao,  2008). 
It  affects  approximately  350  million  people  every  year, 
especially  those  in  Asia,  Africa,  Southern  Europe,  and 
Latin  America  (Lok  and  McMahon,  2007).
    The  clinical  courses  of  HBV  infection  are  diverse, 
ranging  from  spontaneous  recovery  after  hepatitis  to  a 
chronic  infection.  The  risk  of  developing  liver  cirrhosis 
(LC)  or  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  is  higher  for 
those  who  happen  to  be  HBV  chronic  carriers  as  com-
pared  to  the  uninfected  ones  (Merican,  Guan  et  al. 
2000).  Several  previous  studies  on  HBV  infection  have 
reported  that  polymorphisms  were  associated  with  the 
risk  of  HCC  and/or  clearance  of  HBV  (Kida et al.,  2007; 
Kim  et al.,  2006;  Park  et al.,  2006;  Shin  et al.,  2003).
    BIRC5  (baculoviral  inhibitor  of  apoptosis  repeat-con-
taning  5),  also  known  as  survivin,  is  a  protein  encoded 
by  the BIRC5  (Altieri  1994a;  Altieri  1994b).  It  belongs  to 
the  inhibitor  of  apoptosis  (IAP)  gene  family.  The  BIRC5 
protein  functions  to  inhibit  caspase  activation,  thus  lead-
ing  to  a  decrease  in  apoptosis  or  programmed  cell 
death.  This  has  been  shown  by  increase  in  apoptosis 
and  decrease  in  tumor  growth  by  disruption  of  BIRC5 
induction  pathways.  In  addition,  the  BIRC5  protein  is 
highly  expressed  in  most  tumor  cells  (Sah et al.,  2006). 
Because  of  this, BIRC5  is  considered  as  one  of  the  po-
tent  target  for  cancer  therapy  (Altieri,  2003).
    A  previous  study  demonstrates  that  BIRC5  is  asso-
ciated  with  microtubules  of  the  mitotic  spindle  at  the 
start  of  mitosis  through  the  disruption  of  microtubule 
formation  after  BIRC5  protein  in  cancer  cells  are  knoc-
ked  out.  This  appearance  leads  to  polyploidy  as  well  as 
massive  apoptosis  (Castedo et al.,  2004).  Another  study 
involves  how  the  BIRC5  depleted  cells  exit  mitosis  with-
out  achieving  proper  chromosome  alignment  and  then 
reforms  single  tetraploid  nuclei.  It  suggests  that  BIRC5 
protein  is  needed  for  sustaining  mitotic  arrest  upon  en-
counter  with  mitosis  problems.  The  previous  studies  im-

196    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(4)  195-202,  December  2009

plicate  that  BIRC5  protein  plays  an  important  regulatory 
role  both  in  the  progression  of  mitosis  and  sustaining 
mitotic  arrest  (Castedo  et al.,  2004).
    Based  on  those  observations  in  cancer  development, 
we  hypothesized  that BIRC5  polymorphisms  may  affect 
the  function  of  BIRC5  protein  and  influence  the  clear-
ance  of  HBV  and  HCC  progression  among  HBV-infected 
patients  thus,  conducting  a  case-control  study  on  the 
BIRC5  gene.

Methods

Study  population  and  outcomes

A  total  of  1,066  Korean  subjects  having  either  present 
or  past  evidences  of  HBV  infection  were  enrolled  from 
the  outpatient  clinic  of  the  liver  unit  or  from  the  Center 
for  Health  Promotion  of  Seoul  National  University  Hos-
pital.  Subjects  were  divided  into  two  different  groups 
according  to  serologic  markers:  the  chronic  carrier  (CC) 
group,  and  the  spontaneous  recovery  (SR)  group.  The 
CC  and  SR  cohorts  consisted  of  632  and  434  subjects, 
respectively  (Table  1).  The  diagnoses  of  the  CC  and  SR 
subjects  were  established  by  repeated  seropositivity  for 
Ⓡ
 
the  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)  (Enzygnost
HBsAg  5.0;  Dade  Behring,  Marburg,  Germany)  over  a 
Ⓡ
 
6-month  period,  and  for  both  anti-HBs  (Enzygnost
Anti-HBs  II;  Dade  Behring,  Marburg,  Germany)  and  an-
ti-HBc  (AB-Corek;  DiaSorin  s.r.l.,  Saluggia,  Italy)  of  the 
IgG  type  without  HBsAg,  respectively.  Asymptomatic 
HBV  carriers,  which  usually  involve  patients  with  inactive 
liver  disease  on  liver  biopsy,  were  also  included  the  in 
CC  group.  However,  it  has  been  known  that,  HBV  con-
tinues  to  replicate,  albeit  at  very  low  levels,  in  some  pa-
tients  that  have  residual  liver  disease,  which  in  most 
cases  leads  to  the  development  of  HCC.  We  excluded 
subjects  who  were  positive  for  anti-HBs  but  not  for  an-

Co.,  Seoul,  Korea).  Patients  who  had  any  other  types  of 
liver  diseases  such  as  autoimmune  hepatitis,  toxic  hep-
atitis,  primary  biliary  cirrhosis,  and  Budd-Chiari  syn-
drome  were  also  excluded  from  the  study.  None  of  the 
patients  had  any  previous  history  of  immunosuppression 
or  anti-viral  treatment.  Informed  consent  was  obtained 
from  each  patient,  and  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of 
Human  Research  at  Seoul  National  University  Hospital 
approved  the  study  protocol.  The  clinical  parameters  are 
summarized  in  Table  1.

Sequence  analysis  of  the  human  BIRC5

Using  the  ABI  PRISM  3700  DNA  analyzer  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA),  we  sequenced  exons,  in-
trons,  and  the  promoter  region  (∼1.5)  to  discover  var-
iants  from  24  unrelated  individual’s  DNA  samples. 
Primer  sets  for  the  amplification  and  sequencing  analy-
sis  of  BIRC5  were  designed  based  on  GenBank  sequ-
ences.  Sequence  analysis  was  carried  out  using  Seq-
Ⓡ
Man

  software.

Genotyping  with  fluorescence  polarization  detec-
tion

Amplifying  primers  and  probes  were  designed 
for

TaqMan
ing  of  the  six  polymorphic  sites.  Primer  Express  (Applied 
Biosystems)  was  used  to  design  both  the  PCR  primers 
and  the  MGB  TaqMan  probes.  One  allelic  probe  was  la-
beled  with  FAM  dye  and  the  other  with  fluorescent  VIC 
dye.  Typically,  PCR  was  run  in  the  TaqMan  Universal 
Master  mix  without  UNG  (Applied  Biosystems)  at  primer 
concentration  of  900  nM  and  TaqMan  MGB-probe  con-

centration  of  200  nM.  The  reaction  was  performed  in  a 
384-well  format  with  a  total  reaction  volume  of  5  ul  us-
ing  20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The  plate  was  then  placed 
in  a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9,700,  Applied  Biosystems)  and 
was  heated  for  2  min  at  50oC,  then  for  10  min  at  95oC, 
followed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  15  sec,  and  finally 
60oC  for  1  min.  The  TaqMan  assay  plate  was  then 
transferred  to  a  Prism  7900HT  instrument  (Applied  Bio-
systems)  where  the  fluorescence  intensity  of  each  well 
was  read.  Fluorescence  data  files  from  each  plate  were 
analyzed  by  automated  software  (SDS  2.1).  Detailed  in-
formation  concerning  the  primers  can  be  obtained  at  the 
website  mentioned  above.

Statistics
We  examined  Lewontin’s  D’  (|D’|)  and  LD  coefficient  r2 
between  all  pairs  of  biallelic  loci  (Hedrick,  1987).  Haplo-

types  of  each  individual  were  determined  using  the  al-
gorithm  developed  by  Stephens  et al.(Stephens  et al., 
2001),  which  (PHASE)  uses  a  Bayesian  approach  in-
corporating  priori  expectations  of  haplotypic  structure 
from  population  genetic  and  coalescent  theory.  Genetic 
effects  of  inferred  haplotypes  were  analyzed  in  the  same 
way  as  SNPs.  Logistic  regression  models  were  used  for 
calculating  odds  ratios  (95%  confidential  interval)  and 
corresponding  P-values  controlling  for  age  (continuous 
value)  and  sex  (male=0,  female=1)  as  covariates.  In  our 
analysis  on  HCC  occurrence,  LC  (LC=1,  no  LC=0)  and 
HBeAg  (negative=0,  blank=1,  positive=2)  were  also  used 
as  covariates.  Statistical  powers  were  also  calculated 
using  PGA  matlab  application  (Menashe,  Rosenberg  et 
al.  2008).  PGA  is  designed  to  calculate  statistical  power 
and  other  values  of  case-control  genetic  association 
studies.  In  this  study,  a  co-dominant  (1df)  model,  rela-
tive  risk  1.3,  disease  prevalence  value  7.1%  (Lee,  Kim

Results

We  identified  eight  genetic  variants  in  BIRC5  using  di-
rect  sequencing  from  24  unrelated  individuals.  The 
range  of  direct  sequencing  included  the  promoter  re-
gion,  as  well  as  the  introns  and  exons  of  BIRC5.  Among 
the  eight  genetic  variants,  four  SNPs  were  located  in  the 

promoter  region  (−1547T＞C, −644T＞C, −625G＞C, 
−241C＞T),  one  in  exon  4  (＋9194A＞G)  and  three  in 

(＋9386T＞C,  ＋9625G＞A,  ＋9809T＞C), 
3’  UTR 
respectively.  The  frequencies  of  each  SNPs  were  0.216 

(−1547T＞C),  0.277  (−644T＞C),  0.272  (−625G＞C), 
0.021  (−241C＞T),  0.227  (＋9194A＞G),  0.236  (＋93-

86T＞C),  0.022  (＋9625G＞A),  and  0.395  (＋9809T＞C) 
(Fig.  1A,  Table  2).
    The  logistic  analysis  for  clearance  of  HBV  infection, 
HCC  occurrence,  and  onset  age  of  HCC  occurrence,  as 
well  as  the  p-values  of  each  polymorphisms,  haplo-
types,  and  statistical  powers  are  displayed  in  Table  3. 
In  the  case  of  SNPs,  among  the  eight  variants  detected 
by  direct  sequencing,  six  were  selected  for  the  associa-
tion  analysis  of  the  clearance  of  HBV  infection  and  HCC 

occurrence.  Two  SNPs  (−241C＞T  and  ＋9625G＞A) 

were  excluded  from  the  analysis  due  to  low  frequencies, 
0.021  and  0.022  respectively.  Among  the  six  polymor-

phisms, −644T＞C  in  the  promoter  region  showed  an 

association  signal  with  HCC  occurrence  (p=0.04)  and 
onset  age  of  HCC  (p=0.05)  before  correction  was  con-
ducted,  whereas  the  other  SNPs  in  the  promoter  regions 
showed  no  association  signals  in  all  the  analysis.  An  as-
sociation  with  the  clearance  of  HBV  infection  before 

correction  was  also  detected  in  ＋9194A＞G  (p=0.04), 
which  led  to  a  change  in  amino  acid  lysine  to  gluta-
mate.
    Another  association  analysis  was  conducted  for  hap-
lotypes.  Five  haplotypes  with  frequencies  greater  than 
5%  were  selected  for  analysis.  The  selected  haplotypes 
were  able  to  explain  more  than  96%  of  the  distribution 
(Fig  1B).  Linkage  disequilibrium  coefficients  (|D’|)  be-
tween  all  SNP  pairs  were  also  shown  (Fig.  1C).  Among 
the  haplotypes  that  we  selected  for  analysis,  haplo-
type-5 [T-T-G-A-T-C]  showed  an  association  with  the 
clearance  of  HBV  infection  (p=0.01)  and  haplotype-2 
[T-T-G-G-T-T]  showed  an  association  in  onset  age  of 
HCC  analysis  (p=0.03)  before  correction  Table  3.

Discussion

BIRC5  serves  as  a  major  factor  in  cancer  development 
by  contributing  to  the  resistance  of  cancer  cells  to 
apoptosis  (Hedrick,  1987).  BIRC5  has  been  known  to  be 
involved  in  cell-cycle  progression  by  bypassing  cell-cy-
cle  checkpoints  leading  to  continued  proliferation  (Am-
brosini et al.,  1998).  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact 
that  tumor  cells  can  divide  without  breaking  and  even-
tually  survive.  In  addition,  a  previous  study  has  reported 
that  the  expression  level  of  BIRC5  in  hepatocellular  car-
cinoma  cells  is  higher  than  in  other  cancer-causing  cells 
(Montorsi  et al.,  2007).  With  the  role  played  by  BIRC5 
in  cancer  development,  we  hypothesized  that  BIRC5 
polymorphisms  were  associated  with  the  clearance  of 
HBV  infection  and/or  HCC  occurrence.
    Previous  studies  have  reported  three  polymorphisms 

(−644T＞C, −625G＞C, −31C＞G)  involved  in  the 
(Jang et al.,  2008)  and  seven  polymorphisms  (−267G＞

A, −241C＞T, −235G＞A, −198, −191, −141  and 
−31C＞G)  studied  for  breast  carcinoma  in  a  French 

population  (n=191)  (Boidot et al.,  2008).  Among  the  pro-
moter  region  polymorphisms  that  were  studied  in  both 

Korean  and  French  populations,  −31C＞G  has  been 

considered  to  play  an  important  role  in  cancer  develop-
ment  by  affecting  the  expression  level  of  mRNA  of 
BIRC5  (Yang  et al.,  2009).  Furthermore,  two  studies 
concerning  cancer  in  Taiwan  and  China  populations  also 

examined  the  −31C＞G  polymorphism  (Wang  et al., 

2009;  Yang et al.,  2009).  In  contrast,  one  study  reported 
that  the  polymorphisms  in  the  promoter  region,  including 

−31C＜G  does  not  have  any  influence  on  the  BIRC5 
activity  (Boidot  et al.,  2008).  Although −31C＞G  was 
promoter  region  polymorphisms  (−1547T＞C, −644T＞
C, −625G＞C)  showed  no  association  signals  with  the 

not  identified  in  our  analysis,  findings  of  this  study  on  the 

clearance  of  HBV  infection  and/or  HCC  occurrence  and 
is  thus,  consistent  with  one  of  the  previous  studies.
    Among  the  six  SNPs  that  were  analyzed  for  large- 
scale  genotyping, ＋9194A＞G  initially  showed  an  asso-
ciation  signal  with  the  clearance  of  HBV  infection  before 
multiple  testing  corrections.  The  polymorphism  also 
demonstrated  a  protective  effect  on  the  clearance  of 
HBV  infection  and  led  to  the  amino  acid  modification 
from  lysine  to  glutamate.  Marusawa  et al.  has  demon-
strated  that  BIRC5  forms  complexes  with  a  cellular  pro-
tein  called  hepatitis  B  X-interacting  protein  (HBXIP).  This 
protein’s  pro-caspase-9  is  activated  by  Apaf1,  a  cyto-
plasmic  protein  recognized  for  associating  the  X  protein 
of  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBX)  and  BIRC5.  Complexes  of 
BIRC5-HBXIP  prevents  the  recruitment  of  components 
that  can  initiate  apoptosis  (Marusawa  et al.,  2003). 
Moreover,  in  another  SNP  study,  Jang  et al.  reported 
that ＋9194A＞G  might  be  related  with  cancer  (Jang et 
al.,  2008).  According  to  the  study  if  alteration  of  amino 
acid  by ＋9194A＞G  in  exon4  affects  protein  formation, 
then  it  will  also  affect  the  interaction  of  HBXIP  and 
BIRC5.  In  this  study,  ＋9194A＞G  initially  showed  an 
association  signal  with  clearance  of  HBV  infection. 
Although  the  signal  disappeared  after  multiple  testing 
corrections,  it  might  provide  valuable  meaning  to  studies 
on  the  function  of  BIRC5.
    In  summary,  we  have  identified  eight  polymorphisms 
in  the  human BIRC5  gene  that  were  used  to  locate  six 
common  polymorphic  sites  selected  for  large-scale 
genotyping.  After  conducting  a  test  on  the  functions  of 
the  promoter  region  polymorphisms,  statistical  analysis 
displayed  no  association  among  polymorphisms  in  the 
promoter  region  with  the  clearance  of  HBV  infection 
and/or  HCC  occurrence.  In  addition,  ＋9194A＞G  ini-
tially  showed  an  association  signal  with  the  clearance  of 
HBV  infection  and  led  to  transformation  of  amino  acid. 

We  also  found  that  haplotype-2  and  haplotype-5  initially 
showed  association  signals  with  HBV  infection  and  the 
onset  age  of  HCC  analysis,  respectively.  However,  all 
association  signals  disappeared  after  multiple  testing 
corrections,  which  led  us  to  conclude  that  there  was  no 
association  between  BIRC5  polymorphisms  and  the 
clearance  of  HBV  infection  and/or  HCC  occurrence. 
Although  our  p-values  did  not  undergo  multiple  testing 
corrections,  results  from  this  study  might  be  useful  for 
future  researches  which  should  include  additional  inves-
tigation  on  the  function  and/or  expression  of  the  poly-
morphisms  of  BIRC5.
