Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have found many important genetic variants that affect various traits. Since these 
studies are useful to investigate untyped but causal variants using linkage disequilibrium (LD), it would be useful to explore 
the haplotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the same LD block of significant associations based on 
high-density variants from population references. Here, we tried to make a haplotype catalog affecting body mass index 
(BMI) through an integrative analysis of previously published whole-genome next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 7 
representative Korean individuals and previously known Korean GWA signals. We selected 435 SNPs that were significantly 
associated with BMI from the GWA analysis and searched 53 LD ranges nearby those SNPs. With the NGS data, the haplotypes 
were phased within the LDs. A total of 44 possible haplotype blocks for Korean BMI were cataloged. Although the current 
result constitutes little data, this study provides new insights that may help to identify important haplotypes for traits and 
low variants nearby significant SNPs. Furthermore, we can build a more comprehensive catalog as a larger dataset becomes 
available.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been a 
useful tool to identify genetic variants that affect various 
traits [1]. Numerous novel important genetic variants asso-
ciated  with  disease  susceptibility  have  been  identified 
through  GWASs  [2].  However,  genome-wide  association 
(GWA) results for complex diseases can generally explain 
only a small part of the genetic variants for complex diseases 
[3].  Generally,  a  GWA  study  identifying  an  association 
between a trait and a genetic variation may be limited in 
understanding  complex  diseases  involving  multiple  func-
tional loci [4]. 

Recently, many approaches to detect an association bet-
ween a trait and one or multiple genetic variants have been 
proposed  to  study  numerous  data  from  GWASs  [5].  In-
ference about linkage disequilibrium (LD), known as non- 

independent association of alleles at different loci, provides 
information for the association of genetic variants affecting 
complex  traits  [6].  Using  LD  analysis,  it  is  possible  to 
characterize  multiple  genomic  variants  associated  with 
phenotypes in terms of haplotypes. A haplotype defines a 
combination of phased alleles in a chromosomal region [4]. 
Thus, haplotype analysis is useful to understand multiloci 
genetic  associations  and  to  identify  susceptibility  loci  for 
diseases. In spite of the advantages of haplotype analysis, 
performing an analysis on a genome-wide scale is not simple, 
due to the uncertainty and complexity of haplotypes [7].

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of a reference popu-
lation may provide insights into the potential causal variants 
hidden  within  the  LD  block  of  interest.  While  the  1000 
Genomes  Project  aims  to  provide  such  information  in 
worldwide  populations  or  ethnic  groups  [8],  it  would  be 
more informative to focus on a reference population on a 
national scale than on a global scale. Recently, several Korean

reference  WGS  datasets  have  been  published  based  on 
next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms [9]. Here, we 
tried  to  construct  haplotype  blocks  affecting  body  mass 
index  (BMI)  in  Korean  individuals  through  integrative 
analysis  of  NGS  and  GWA  data.  We  analyzed  haplotypes 
using NGS data only in ranges that were nearby significant 
single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  that  were  iden-
tified  by  GWA  results.  The  analysis  may  have  several 
advantages in haplotype analysis. The complexity and the 
time can be reduced by analyzing smaller regions that are 
known to harbor significant GWA signals. We cataloged all 
possible  44  haplotype  blocks  within  the  LD  blocks  of 
significant SNPs for BMI. 

Methods
Overall pipeline of the analysis

The NGS raw data were mapped to reference sequences 
using an alignment tool. The significant SNPs for BMI were 
selected  from  the  GWA  result  data.  The  LD  blocks  that 
encompassed  the  significant  SNPs  were  searched  with 
Haploview [10], and those NGS reads that were mapped to 
the LD ranges were selected with Samtools. For each LD 
block, the heterozygous variants from the short reads were 
phased  with  Samtools.  Finally,  the  phased  haplotypes 
harboring the significant SNPs were cataloged (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Pipeline for this study. First, next-generation sequencing raw
data  (fastq)  are  aligned  using  Genomic  Short-read  Nucleotide 
Alignment  Program  (GSNAP),  and  then,  the  reads  without  bad 
mapping  quality  are  selected.  In  addition,  significant  single- 
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  are  learned  from  the  genome- 
wide  association  study  results,  and  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD) 
ranges with the SNPs are searched by HaploView. Using Samtools,
reads  within  the  LD  ranges  are  selected  and  phased.  As  a  result,
a haplotype catalog can be constructed, including haplotypes with
significant  SNPs.

Genotyping, imputation, and GWA analysis

The Korean samples and genotype data used in this study 
have been described by Cho et al. [11]. Briefly, through the 
Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project,  a  total  of 
10,038 participants were recruited from Ansan and Anseong 
population-based cohorts, aged 40 to 69. The genotypes that 
had  been  measured  on  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human 
SNP  array  5.0  (Affymetrix,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA)  were 
filtered for quality control, resulting in 8,842 samples and 
352,228  markers. The  genotype  data  were  expanded  to  a 
total of 1,827,004 SNPs through imputation with IMPUTE 
[12] using the Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT)/Han Chinese 
in  Beijing,  China  (CHB)  component  of  HapMap  as  the 
reference.

BMI traits were tested for association by linear regression 
analysis  with  an  additive  model  after  adjustments  for 
recruitment region, age, and sex as covariates using PLINK. 
The threshold of genome-wide significance was set at p ＜ 5 
–4. The significant SNPs were clustered into LD blocks 
× 10
(r2 ＞ 0.9) using HaploView [13].

NGS data analysis

We  downloaded  previously  published  whole-genome 
NGS  data  from  the  TIARA  database,  sequenced  at  Seoul 
National  University  College  of  Medicine  (TIARA;  http:// 
tiara.gmi.ac.kr) [14]. The short reads from seven samples 
(AK3, AK4, AK5, AK6, AK7, AK14, and AK20) were mapped 
to the human reference genome (hg19) using the alignment 
algorithm  in  Genomic  Short-read  Nucleotide  Alignment 
Program (GSNAP) [15]. From the resulting BAM file, we 
selected  the  mapped  reads  within  the  LD  blocks  that 
encompassed the significant SNPs from the BMI GWA result 
using the Samtools view function [16], creating a separate 
BAM file for each LD block.

Heterozygous SNP calling and phasing

The  heterozygous  SNPs  were  phased  using  the  phase 
function  in  Samtools,  version  0.1.19-44428cd  [17].  The 
Samtools  phase  algorithm  calls  heterozygous  SNPs  auto-
matically and phases those that segregate on the same DNA 
fragment as inferred from paired-end read information in the 
BAM  file.  We  used  the  default  options  for  the  Samtools 
phase function. We confirmed the heterozygous SNPs th-
rough  independent  calling  using  the  Samtools  mpileup 
function  [17].  Whenever  an  LD  block  split  into  multiple 
phased haplotype blocks, we kept those that encompassed 
the significant SNPs from the GWAS.

Results
GWA analysis

The genotype data of 8,842 samples in a total of 10,038 
participants in the KARE were analyzed to find significant 
SNPs associated with BMI in Korean individuals. Among the 
total  of  1,827,004  loci,  435  loci  were  identified  using  a 
–4) from the GWAS. The default 
p-value cutoff (p ＜ 5 × 10
algorithm  in  the  HaploView  program  for  identifying  LD 
blocks was taken from confidence intervals [13]. We set a 
±20-kb window option and r2 ＞ 0.9 to capture LD blocks of 
435 significant SNPs based on the KARE genotype data. For 
435 loci that were significant in the association analysis (p ＜ 
–4), 53 LD blocks were identified using HaploView 
5 × 10
(Table 1). These 53 LD blocks contained all 435 significant 
loci. Thus, a typical LD block included multiple significant 
loci.

Phasing short reads

We downloaded whole-genome paired-end NGS data of 
seven samples from the TIARA database to discover haplo-
types with the SNPs associated with BMI within the 53 LD 
blocks from the GWA analysis. We mapped the short reads to 
the human reference genome (hg19), and those reads with 
bad mapping quality (mapping quality ＜5) were filtered out. 
The average mapping rate was about 93%. We separated the 
mapped  reads  into  the  53  LD  blocks  for  each  of  seven 
individuals  (Table  1).  Each  group  of  separated  reads  was 
called for variants, and the heterozygous SNPs were phased 
using the phase function in Samtools. Not all of the SNPs in 
an LD block were always phased into a contiguous haplotype 
block. Whenever multiple haplotype blocks were found for a 
given LD block, we kept only those that encompassed the 
significant SNPs identified from the GWAS. 

Construction of the haplotype blocks

After  phasing  heterozygous  SNPs  using  Samtools,  we 
searched  for  phased  haplotypes  that  harbored  significant 
risk alleles for BMI from the GWA analysis results. We found 
44 haplotype blocks in 23 of 53 LD blocks. We could not find 
haplotypes with significant risk alleles in the rest of the LD 
blocks. We ordered 44 haplotypes and established a catalog 
for possible haplotype blocks associated with BMI variations 
in the Korean population (Table 2). For example, AK4 and 
AK7 share the TCTGAGCC haplotype, which comprises the 
variants at bps 246142250, 246142279, 246144436, 24614-
6137, 246146178, 246146444, 246148791, and 246149166 
in chromosome 1. Bp 57895600 in chromosome 18 has been 
previously known as rs8089366 (G/T) in the dbSNP data-
base and was a significant SNP for BMI in KARE. On the 
other hand, bp 57900630, which participated in the same 
haplotype, has not been registered in the dbSNP database. In 
Table 2, 16 LD blocks were shared by several individuals, 
while  the  rest  of  the  LD  blocks  were  carried  by  single 
individuals. 

Distribution of haplotype blocks

We  calculated  the  average  space  between  alleles  in  a 
haplotype block from our results. For example, AK4, AK5, 
and AK7 share CGCC at bps 182065282, 182065314, 18206-
5341,  and  182065351  in  chromosome  4  (Table  2).  The 
haplotype  block  ranges  from  bp  182065282  through  bp 
182065351; the length of the haplotype is 69 bp. Since there 
are four SNPs, the average space is about 17. We plotted the 
distribution of the average spaces between SNPs within a 
haplotype  (Fig.  2).  The  number  of  alleles  found  for  a 
haplotype is also plotted in Fig. 2.

Discussion

The  GWAS  is  a  powerful  method  to  identify  genomic 
variants affecting traits. Many studies have found important 
SNPs associated with diseases. However, the study is not 
well suited to identify rare variants or small effects of several 
SNPs [18]. Here, we tried to find haplotype blocks in 7 Korea 
individuals that harbor SNPs that are significantly associated 
with BMI in a Korean population. The significant SNPs for 
BMI  were  detected  through  GWASs,  and  the  haplotypes 
were  discovered  by  analyzing  the  NGS  data.  We  selected 
short  reads  within  the  LD  ranges  that  encompassed  the 
significant SNPs from the GWAS results, and the hetero-
zygous  variants  that  were  called  from  those  reads  were 
phased, based on the paired-end information. As a result, we 
detected  44  haplotype  blocks  harboring  SNPs  that  are 
significantly associated with BMI in Koreans. The haplotypes 
may  affect  BMI  in  Korea  individuals.  However,  it  is  not 

statically powerful, due to the small number of samples (7 
individuals)  used  in  this  study.  Actually,  the  alleles  of  a 
haplotype need to be compared with those of the haplotype 
of the same range in other individuals to have high accuracy. 
We could not follow this strategy. For example, most of the 
haplotypes found by this analysis were discovered in a single 
individual. In our small dataset, a significant SNP from a 
GWAS  is  not  likely  to  be  shared  by  several  individuals, 
because many SNPs have a minor allele frequency of around 
10% in a population. This problem may be solved if a large 
dataset is used. In addition, read depth also reduces accuracy. 
In  Table  2,  several  haplotypes  were  identified  in  a  single 
GWA LD block. These haplotypes could not be joined, as 
there were not enough short reads that could bridge them 
using the phase function in Samtools. In addition, AK7 has 
the GATX haplotype at bps 57903745, 57904011 (rs590654), 
57904088 (rs590215), and 57907787 in chromosome 18, 
and AK4 has XAXC in the same locus. An X represents a

missing allele, probably due to low coverage. We were able to 
recover them, as Samtools was still able to phase them. We 
filled in these alleles manually to build the haplotype. In 
Table 2, the green letters represent such alleles that have 
been  filtered  by  read  depth  and  recovered  manually. 
Although the accuracy is not high, this integrative method 
has several advantages. First, rare variants can be detected. 
For example, AK4 has the TT risk allele haplotype at bps 
57895600  and  57900630  in  chromosome  18.  The  former 
was associated with BMI and was registered in the dbSNP 
database, while the latter was not registered in the dbSNP 
database.  Bp  57900630  is  possibly  a  low-frequency  risk 
allele, which is difficult to be detected by GWAS. Second, we 
can explain a trait systematically. rs559623 is an SNP (C/A: 
forward strand) that is associated with BMI. It may act with 
bp  57844375  in  chromosome  18  as  CC  according  to  our 
results (Table 2). Traits can be explained properly by multiple 
variants. Finally, this method is useful for studying phasing. 
Many  SNPs  from  an  array  or  NGS  reads  are  unphased 
genotypes. However, the bulk of SNP information needs to 
be phased  for identifying  co-located  alleles.  While  GATK 
HaplotypeCaller,  Samtools  Phase,  and  Beagle  are  used  to 
phase variants, there are several problems, such as the long 
execution time and the need for large system memory. In 
fact,  it  takes  too  long  to  phase  entire  chromosomes  or  a 
single  chromosome.  However,  with  this  method,  it  is 
possible  to  analyze  efficiently  with  regard  to  time  and 
memory, as it does not consider reference and genotype data 
of the entire chromosome. This method focuses only on the 
data within regions that are nearby important variants from 
the GWA analysis results. We constructed a crucial haplo-
type catalog for BMI traits in Korean individuals by inte-
gratively analyzing NGS data and GWA analysis data.
