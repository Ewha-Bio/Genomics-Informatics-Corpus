Abstract

The  imputation  of  untyped  SNPs  enables  researchers  to 
validate  association  findings  across  SNP  arrays  and  also 
enables  them  to  test  a  large  number  of  SNPs  to  reveal 
the  fine  structure  of  the  association  peak,  facilitating  in-
terpretation  of  the  results  and  the  location  of  causal 
polymorphisms.  In  this  study,  we  applied  the  imputation 
method  to  a  genomewide  association  study  and  re-
capitulated  the  previously  associated  gene  loci  of  blood 
pressure  traits  in  Korean  cohorts.  A  total  of  1,827,004 
SNPs  were  imputed  by  the  IMPUTE  program,  and  we 
conducted  a  genomewide  association  study  for  systolic 
and  diastolic  blood  pressure.  While  no  SNPs  passed  the 
Bonferroni  correction  p-value  (p=2.74×10
SNPs),  12  novel  loci  for  systolic  blood  pressure  and  16 
novel  loci  for  diastolic  blood  pressure  were  detected  by 
imputed  SNPs,  with  10
regions  (ATP2B1,  10p15.1,  ARHGEF12,  ALX4,  LIPC, 
7q31.1,  and  TCF7L2)  out  of  14  genetic  loci  that  were 
previously  reported  revealed  that  the  imputed  SNPs  had 
lower  p-values  than  those  of  genotyped  SNPs.  Moreover, 
a  nonsynonymous  SNP  in  the  CSMD1  gene,  one  of  the 
14  genes,  was  found  to  be  associated  with  systolic 
blood  pressure  (p＜0.05).  These  results  suggest  that  the 
imputation  method  can  facilitate  the  discovery  of  novel 
SNPs  as  well  as  enhance  the  fine  structure  of  the  asso-
ciation  peak  in  the  loci.

The  human  genome  contains  ~10  million  single  nucleo-
tide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  but  only  a  small  fraction  of 
them  has  been  assayed  using  current  high-density  mi-
croarrays,  such  as  Illumina  and  Affymetrix  platforms.  To 
enhance  an  original  association  study,  the  genotypes  of 
untyped  SNPs  can  be  imputed  based  on  nearby  mark-
ers  and  can  be  tested  for  association  with  phenotypes 
of  interest.  This  strategy  enables  researchers  to  easily 
replicate  and  compare  previous  findings  across  array 
types  and  enables  them  to  test  a  large  number  of  SNPs 
to  reveal  the  fine  structure  of  the  association  peak,  facil-
itating  interpretation  of  the  results  and  the  location  of 
causal  polymorphisms  (Hao  et al.,  2009).  By  using  the 
imputed  SNPs,  Tobin  and  colleagues  identified  a  sig-
nificant  association  of  the  WNT1  gene  with  diastolic 
blood  pressure,  and  Knouff  and  colleagues  identified  a 
significant  association  between  the  CETP  gene  and  dia-
stolic  blood  pressure  (Knouff  et al.,  2008;  Tobin  et al., 
2008).

The  first  genomewide  association  study  for  large  co-
horts  in  Korea  was  conducted  by  the  Korea  National 
Institute  of  Health  (KNIH)  and  reported  associations  with 
8  quantitative  traits,  including  blood  pressure  (Cho  et 
al.,  2009).  The  Korean  GWAS  suggested  a  total  of  14 
loci for blood pressure, 2 (ATP2B1 and 10 p15.1) of which 
were  significant  association  loci  (p-value＜10

To  enhance  the  original  association  study,  a  total  of

Methods

Subjects  and  their  genotypes  were  reported  in  a  pre-
vious  genomewide  association  study  (Cho et al.,  2009). 
Briefly,  subjects  came  from  2  community-based  cohorts, 
the  rural  community  Ansung  and  the  urban  community 
Ansan,  in  KyungGi-Do  province,  near  Seoul,  Korea.  Most 
DNA  samples  were  isolated  from  the  peripheral  blood  of 
participants  and  genotyped  using  the  Affymetrix  Genome-
wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  (Affymetrix,  Inc.,  Santa  Clara, 
CA,  USA).  After  the  quality  control  steps,  we  finally  used 

104    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(3)  103-107,  September  2010

7751  individuals  for  blood  pressure  traits.  The  351,677 
genotyped  SNPs  had  a  missing  gene  call  rate  below 
0.1,  a  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  higher  than  0.01, 
and  no  deviation 
from  Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium 
(HWE)  (p＞1×10

    The  basic  characteristics  and  blood  pressures  of  the 
subjects  are  listed  in  Table  1.  For  this  study,  blood 
pressure  measurements  were  taken  3  times  in  the  su-
pine  position.  Before  the  first  measurement,  participants 
rested  for  5  minutes,  and  3  measurements  were  made 
at  least  30  seconds  apart.  The  average  of  the  3  meas-
urements  was  used  for  this  study. 
    The  KARE  dataset,  comprising  351,677  SNPs  for 
7751  individuals,  was  merged  with  that  of  International 
HapMap  Phase  II  JPT  (Japanese)+HCB  (Chinese)  panel 
2.  The  genotypes  of  the  KARE  individuals  were  imputed 
using  IMPUTE  (Howie  et al.,  2009).
    Most  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  PLINK, 
version  1.07  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) 
(Purcell et al.,  2007)  and  SAS  (version  9.1;  SAS  Institute 
Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  Systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and 
diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  were  tested  for  their  as-

20q13.13  and  2q33.1,  which  had  7  and  6  SNPs  of  sig-

densely,  which  enables  one  to  test  a  large  number  of 
SNPs  to  reveal  the  fine  structure  of  the  association 
peak.  The  association  results  of  the  TCF7L2  gene  could 
fall  under  this  case  (Fig.  1).  While  only  one  SNP  with  a 
p-value  lower  than  10
association  by  the  genotyped  SNPs,  the  imputed  SNPs 
showed  multiple  SNPs  (p-value  ＜10
ciated  around  the  peak,  indicating  that  the  imputation 
methods  enhance  the  fine  structure  of  the  GWAS  re-
sults.  Moreover,  6  nonsynonymous  SNPs  in  the  14 
genes  were  identified  from  the  imputed  SNPs,  and  the 
rs11984691  of  CSMD1  revealed  an  association  signal 
with  systolic  pressure  (p-value=0.015)  (Table  4). CSMD1 
(CUB  and  Sushi  multiple  domains  1)  is  located  on  chro-
mosome  8p23.2  and  is  known  as  a  putative  suppressor 
of  squamous  cell  carcinomas  of  the  head  and  neck  (Sun 
et al.,  2001).  The  gene  encodes  a  389-KDa  transmem-
brane  protein,  named  for  its  repeat  CUB  and  sushi 
domains.  Both  CUB  and  sushi  domains  are  found  in 
many  other  proteins  and  are  thought  to  be  sites  of  ei-
ther protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions (Kristiansen 
et al.,  1999;  Lau  and  Scholnick,  2003).  The  association 
between  the  CSMD1  gene  and  blood  pressure  was  re-
plicated  in  our  previous  report  (Hong et al.,  2010),  and 
the  nonsynonymous  rs11984691  might  be  a  causative 
variation  of  the  CSMD1  gene  for  the  regulation  of  blood 
pressure,  which  waits  for  its  functional  analysis  in  the 
future.
    In  conclusion,  a  total  of  1,827,004  SNPs  were  im-
puted  based  on  International  HapMap  Asian  data,  and 
a  genomewide  association  study  of  KARE  for  systolic 
and  diastolic  blood  pressure  was  performed.  Even 
though  no  SNPs  were  found  to  be  statistically  sig-
nificant  over  the  Bonferroni  corrected  p-value,  12  novel 
loci  for  systolic  blood  pressure  and  16  novel  loci  for  di-
astolic  blood  pressure  were  identified  in  the  range  of 
10
revealed  better  p-values  in  7  out  of  14  genetic  loci  that 
were  previously  reported  by  the  genotyped  SNPs.  These 
results  suggest  that  the  imputation  method  can  facilitate 
the  discovery  of  associated  SNPs  as  well  as  enhance 
the  fine  structure  of  the  association  in  the  loci.
