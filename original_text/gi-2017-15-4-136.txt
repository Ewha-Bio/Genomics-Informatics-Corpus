Accurate detection of genomic alterations, especially druggable hotspot mutations in tumors, has become an essential part 
of precision medicine. With targeted sequencing, we can obtain deeper coverage of reads and handle data more easily with 
a relatively lower cost and less time than whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing. Recently, we designed a customized 
gene panel for targeted sequencing of major solid cancers. In this study, we aimed to validate its performance. The cancer 
panel targets 95 cancer-related genes. In terms of the limit of detection, more than 86% of target mutations with a mutant 

allele frequency (MAF) ＜1% can be identified, and any mutation with ＞3% MAF can be detected. When we applied this 

system for the analysis of Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA, which contains more than 500 COSMIC mutations 
across 53 genes, 99% of the expected mutations were robustly detected. We also confirmed the high reproducibility of the 
detection of mutations in multiple independent analyses. When we explored copy number alterations (CNAs), the expected 
CNAs were successfully detected, and this result was confirmed by target-specific genomic quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction. Taken together, these results support the reliability and accuracy of our cancer panel in detecting mutations. This 
panel could be useful for key mutation profiling research in solid tumors and clinical translation.

Introduction

Accurate  detection  of  genomic  alterations,  especially 
druggable  hot  spot  mutations  in  tumors,  has  become  an 
essential part of precision medicine and medical research. 
Due  to  the  advent  of  next-generation  sequencing  (NGS) 
technology, the ability to identify mutations has increased 
enormously, which has facilitated the realization of precision 
medicine  [1].  However,  even  with  NGS  technology,  the 
amount  of  whole-genome  sequencing  (WGS)  data  is  too 
large to handle by most researchers or clinicians. Whole-exome 
sequencing (WES), which targets the protein-coding sequ-
ences of whole genomes, is more efficient and cost-effective 
than WGS. Therefore, WES data are the most commonly 
generated NGS data in the research field [2]. However, the 
amount of WES data is too vast for clinicians to analyze and 

use in clinical practice, requiring an expert. In addition to 
data  size  issues,  analyzing  WES  data  needs  experienced 
bioinformaticians, which is another big hurdle for clinical 
translation and application to basic research. The limited 
amount of available druggable targets is another practical 
limitation of WES for clinical translation.

Compared with WES and WGS, targeted sequencing uses 
target enrichment methods to capture or amplify regions of 
interest.  With  targeted  sequencing,  we  can  get  deeper 
coverage of reads and handle data more easily with relatively 
lower  cost  and  less  time.  For  these  reasons,  targeted 
sequencing is noted to identify hotspot mutations and copy 
number alterations (CNAs) in cancer-related genes in the 
clinical field and research. It enables one to diagnose quickly 
and accurately and suggest appropriate therapeutic appro-
aches that can elicit a favorable treatment outcome [3-5].

Limit of mutation detection 

To verify the limit of detection, we used the Quantitative 
Multiplex  Reference  Standard  DNA  (Horizon  Discovery) 
sample,  which  contains  11  variants  with  variant  allele 
frequencies (VAFs) ranging from 1% to 24.5%. We diluted 
the reference DNA from 100% to 10% and sequenced it with 
OncoChase-AS.  The  limit  of  detection  and  correlation 
between the expected and observed VAFs were calculated as 
described [14]. Correlation coefficient and linear regression 
analysis was performed using R.

Concordance of variant detection

To check the concordance of the detected variants, Acro-
metrix  Oncology  Hotspot  Control  DNA  (Thermo  Fisher 
Scientific) was used. NGS reactions were performed with the 
OncoChase-AS panel in triplicated runs. We annotated the 
variants using the ANNOVAR program [11]. The criteria for 
variant calling were as follows: exonic variants detected in 
more than 5% in the 1000 Genomes Project and the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Project for East Asian and 
variants with ＞3% mutant allele frequency (MAF) [15, 16].

Reproducibility of mutation detection

To  check  the  repeatability  and  reproducibility  of  the 
detection of mutations, especially mutations with a low VAF, 
we prepared mixtures of the DNAs extracted from four cell 
lines (H1975, HCT116, HT29, and SW620). NGS experi-
ments were performed in duplicate by different researchers 
independently. 

Detection of CNA

DNA copy number profiling of the targeted sequencing 
data  was  performed  using  NEXUS  Copy  Number,  v9.0 
(BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA). CNA regions were defined 

interest is another advantage of a customized panel. In the 
new era of precision medicine, a number of institutes have 
developed  customized  target  sequencing  tools  for  disco-
vering effective therapeutic agents [6-8].

In spite of these advantages, the performance of custo-
mized panels must be validated, such as evenness of on-tar-
get rates and their sensitivity/specificity in detecting muta-
tions [9]. We recently developed a customized NGS panel, 
named  OncoChase-AS,  for  targeted  sequencing  of  major 
solid cancers. In this study, we aimed to validate its per-
formance.

Methods
Samples

To validate the performance of OncoChase-AS, we first 
tested  the  limit  of  mutation  detection  by  using  the 
Quantitative Multiplex Reference Standard, which contains 
11 mutations across six cancer-related genes (Horizon Dis-
covery, Cambridge, UK). Mutation detection was examined 
using the Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), a mixture of more 
than  500  Catalogue  of  Somatic  Mutations  in  Cancer 
(COSMIC)  mutations  across  53  genes.  Four  cell  lines 
(HCT116, H1975, SW620, and HT29) were obtained from 
the Korean Cell Line Bank and used to assess the correlation 
with  repeatability  and  reproducibility.  To  test  the 
identification of CNAs, we used two primary tumors that are 
known to have CNAs, with the approval of the institutional 
review board of Catholic University of Korea. Genomic DNA 
was extracted from these samples using the DNeasy Blood & 
Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 

NGS and data analysis

We performed NGS analysis for the DNA samples with 
the OncoChase-AS cancer panel using an Ion S5 sequencer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Raw sequence data were analy-
zed with the Torrent Suite (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 
aligner  for  mapping  reads  to  the  reference  genome  is 
included in the Torrent Suite [10]. To call variants from the 
mapped  sequence  data,  we  used  a  plug-in  in  the  Torrent 
Suite, Torrent Variant Caller (v5.2.2.41). In order to annotate 
the called variants with the queried knowledge database, we 
used ANNOVAR [11]. In order to verify variants that were 
not  detected  by  the  Torrent  Variant  Caller  plug-in,  we 
confirmed no-called variants using the Integrative Genomic 
Viewer (IGV) program [12] with binary alignment mapping 
(BAM) format files as raw sequencing data before calling 
variants [13].

genes were selected for mutation screening, 10 genes were 
selected for CNA screening, and the other 44 genes were 
selected for screening of both mutations and CNAs (Fig. 1). 

Limit of mutation detection

To  determine  the  limit  of  mutation  detection  with 
OncoChase-AS, we used the Quantitative Multiplex Refe-
rence Standard DNA (Horizon Discovery), which contains 
11 mutations with a 1% to 24.5% VAF across six cancer-re-
lated genes (BRAF, KIT, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA) 
(Table 1). When we performed NGS analysis with Onco-
Chase-AS in duplicate, all of the expected mutations were 
consistently identified in both NGS analyses (Table 1). To 
assess the limit of mutation detection, we serially diluted the 
DNA sample from 50% to 10% and performed NGS analysis 
with each diluted DNA in duplicate. As a result, mutations 
with  a  very  low  MAF  (＜1%  MAF)  were  successfully 
identified  in  most  of  the  mutations  (19/22,  86.4%). 
Mutations  with  a  low  MAF  (1%  to  3%  MAF)  were  also 
successfully  identified  in  most  of  the  mutations  (23/26, 
88.5%).  All  mutations  with  ＞3%  MAF  were  detected 
without exception (40/40, 100%) (Table 1). These results 
suggest that more than 86% of the mutations with ＜1% 
VAF can be identified by NGS analysis with OncoChase-AS. 
These results also suggest that any mutations with ＞3% 
frequency  can  be  detected  with  this  platform.  When  we 
calculated  the  correlation  between  the  expected  and 
observed VAFs by linear regression analysis, the R2 value 
was 0.97 (Fig. 2). This result further supports the reliability 
of this system for variant identification.

by a rank segmentation algorithm. In the rank segmentation 
algorithm, we set a threshold for segmentation of p = 1.0E−
6. The thresholds for copy number gain and loss were 0.3 and 
‒0.4 on a log2 scale, respectively. The thresholds for ampli-
fication and homozygous deletion were 1.0 and ‒1.0 on a log2 
scale, respectively.

Results and Discussion 
Design of the custom cancer panel

The  custom  NGS  panel,  named  OncoChase-AS,  was 
designed to detect 95 cancer-related genes with clinically 
important  variants  (Fig.  1).  The  95  genes  were  selected 
based on the published literature and cancer databases, such 
as COSMIC [17] and GENIE [18]. Of the 95 target genes, 41

Performance in detecting mutations 

To determine how completely OncoChase-AS NGS detec-
ted the expected mutations, we used Acrometrix Oncology 
Hotspot Control DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which is a 
mixture of 55 tumors that contain more than 500 COSMIC 
mutations  across  53  genes.  Among  the  mutations  in  the 
Acrometrix Oncology Hotspot Control DNA, OncoChase-AS 
targeted 358 mutations. Therefore, in principle, 358 muta-
tions are expected to detected, if OncoChase-AS NGS works 
perfectly. In the first analysis, 353 out of the 358 expected 
mutations  were  detected  (98.6%  concordance).  In  the 
second  analysis,  all  358  mutations  were  detected  (100% 
concordance). In the third analysis, the concordance rate was 
98.6%  (353/358)  (Table  2).  These  results  indicate  that 
OncoChase-AS is fairly sensitive and reliable in identifying 
mutations. 

Reproducibility of mutation detection

Cancer gene panels can be used for clinical tests, such as 
the identification of druggable mutations from tumor tissue 
or  liquid  biopsy,  in  addition  to  research.  Therefore,  the 
reproducibility of mutation detection is an important issue. 
To test the reproducibility of mutation detection, we per-
formed  OncoChase-AS  NGS  with  four  cell  lines  (H1975, 
HCT116,  HT29,  and  SW620)  harboring  eight  known 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

mutations  (Table  3).  In  this  analysis,  cell  line  mixture 
samples were sequenced in triplicate by two different resear-
chers. All of the expected mutations in mixtures and the 
MAFs were measured in every run. With these results, we 
verified the repeatability and reproducibility of the Onco-
Chase-AS  panel.  The  average  repeatability  and  repro-
ducibility were 98% (ranging from 93% to 100%) and 98% 
(ranging from 95% to 100%), respectively (Table 3). 

Detection of CNAs

Chromosomal  alteration  is  one  of the most  commonly 
occurring events during tumorigenesis. OncoChase-AS was 
designed to detect CNAs for 54 genes, including most of the 
clinically important CNAs, such as ERBB2 amplification and 
CDKN2A/B deletion. To test whether OncoChase-AS detec-
ted CNAs properly, we analyzed two primary tumors (brain 
cancer  and  sarcoma)  with  known  CNAs:  ERBB2  ampli-
fication in a brain cancer and CDKN2A deletion in a sarcoma. 
As a result, the expected CNAs were detected precisely by 
OncoChase-AS NGS analysis (Fig. 3). When we validated 
the target CNAs by genomic quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (qPCR), the results were consistent with the NGS

analysis results. Although we did not test all 54 target genes, 
the current results indicate that OncoChase-AS can robustly 
detect clinically important CNAs. 

In conclusion, we have developed a cancer panel conta-
ining  95  cancer-related  genes.  In  terms  of  the  limit  of 
detection,  OncoChase-AS  can  detect  more  than  86%  of 
target mutations with ＜1% MAF. In the case of those with 
＞3% MAF, any mutation can be detected by NGS analysis 
with OncoChase-AS. When we applied this system for the 
analysis  of  Acrometrix  Oncology  Hotspot  Control  DNA, 
which contains more than 500 COSMIC mutations across 53 
genes,  99%  of  the  expected  mutations  were  robustly 
detected. We also confirmed the very high reproducibility of 
the mutation detection in multiple independent analyses. 
When we examined CNAs, two expected CNAs related to 
tumorigenesis  were  successfully  detected,  and  this  result 
was confirmed by target-specific genomic qPCR. All of these 
results  support  the  reliability  and  accuracy  of  our  Onco-
Chase-AS platform in detecting mutations. Therefore, this 
panel could be helpful for key mutation profiling research in 
solid tumors and clinical translational research, because this 
panel covers all 14 essential genes that have been suggested 
to be included in cancer panels for support from the national 
health insurance system in Korea. There are limitations of 
our panel. Due to the technical limitations of PCR ampli-
fication-based  NGS,  OncoChase-AS  cannot  detect  repeat 
sequences with enough reliability and reproducibility, such 
as microsatellite instabilities and the promoter region of the 
TERT gene. For this purpose, a hybridization-based targeted 
sequencing panel would be more suitable.
