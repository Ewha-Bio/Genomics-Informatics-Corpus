Approximately 45% of the human genome is comprised of transposable elements (TEs). Results from the Human Genome 
Project have emphasized the biological importance of TEs. Many studies have revealed that TEs are not simply “junk” DNA, 
but rather, they play various roles in processes, including genome evolution, gene expression regulation, genetic instability, 
and cancer disposition. The effects of TE insertion in the genome varies from negligible to disease conditions. For the past 
two decades, many studies have shown that TEs are the causative factors of various genetic disorders and cancer. TEs are a 
subject of interest worldwide, not only in terms of their clinical aspects but also in basic research, such as evolutionary 
tracking. Although active TEs contribute to genetic instability and disease states, non-long terminal repeat transposons are 
well  studied,  and  their  roles  in  these  processes  have  been  confirmed.  In  this  review,  we  will  give  an  overview  of  the 
importance of TEs in studying genome evolution and genetic instability, and we suggest that further in-depth studies on the 
mechanisms related to these phenomena will be useful for both evolutionary tracking and clinical diagnostics.

Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA sequences that are 
capable of integrating into the genome at a new site within 
the  cell  of  its  origin.  Sometimes,  the  change  in  their 
positions creates or reverses mutations, thereby altering the 
cell's  genotype.  Barbara  McClintock's  discovery  of  these 
“jumping genes” earned her a Nobel Prize in 1983 [1]. TEs 
are prevalent in all plants and animals. In mammals, TEs and 
their remnants make up almost half of the genome, and in 
some plants, they constitute up to 90% of the genome [2]. 
TEs  consist  of  two  major  classes:  DNA  transposons  and 
retrotransposons. DNA transposons are capable of moving 
and inserting into new genomic sites [3]. Although they are 
currently not mobile in the human genome, they were active 
during early primate evolution until ∼37 million years ago 
(Mya)  [4].  Retrotransposons  replicate  by  forming  RNA 
intermediates, which are then reverse-transcribed to make 
DNA sequences and inserted into new genomic locations 
[4]. Based on the presence of long terminal repeats (LTRs), 

retrotransposons are further classified into two groups: LTR 
and  non-LTR  transposons.  In  humans,  LTR  elements  are 
called  human  endogenous  retroviruses  (HERVs).  It  is 
estimated that HERVs inserted into the human genome ＞25 
Mya [5, 6]. Non-LTR retrotransposons include long inter-
spersed element 1 (LINE-1 or L1), Alu, and SVA elements. 
Studies have revealed that these are the only TEs that are 
currently active in humans [7-11]. 

TEs  have  driven  genome  evolution  in  multiple  ways. 
Retrotransposons  comprise  a  large  proportion  of  the 
genome, especially in plants and mammals. The effect of the 
increase  in  retrotransposons  has  been  tolerated  during 
evolution. Accumulating literature has proven that mobile 
elements are useful tools for studying genome evolution and 
gene function [12]. A comparative analysis has shown that 
the human genome makes 655 perfect full-length matches 
with vertebrate TEs. TE insertions have been shown to have 
many  effects,  such  as  regulation  of  gene  expression,  in-
creased  recombination  rate,  and  unequal  crossover.  TE 
insertions have caused many effective changes in the human

genome, and the selected changes have been responsible for 
the evolution of the human lineage [13]. The human genome 
contains many recently inserted active TEs, such as AluYa5, 
AluYb8, and AluYc1. Alu elements are a family of primate- 
specific short interspersed DNA elements. Various studies 
have  proposed  that  Alu  element  insertions  have  created 
many variants that can potentially be used as DNA markers 
in human population studies, as well as in forensic analyses. 
Kass et al. [14] have identified an Alu-based polymorphism 
that consists of four alleles, from which the evolutionary 
order can be predicted. 

The  effects  of  TEs  on  genetic  instability  and  human 
diseases  have  not  been  thoroughly  studied.  The  mobile 
property of TEs is the reason for their mutational potential. 
TE insertions may create a broad range of effects on humans, 
ranging from silent mutations to alternative splicing. Both 
insertions and excisions of TEs can cause genomic instabil-
ity, thus causing many human diseases, including genetic 
disorders,  psychiatric  problems,  and  cancer  [15-21].  Fur-
thermore, TE insertions may result in insertional mutations, 
non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), creation of 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

novel regulatory sequences, and epigenetic changes [22]. A 
large number of human diseases that are associated with 
NAHR  between  Alu  elements  have  been  reported  [22]. 
Technical advances have helped to detect TE-associated dis-
eases and develop novel biomarkers for clinical diagnostics. 
Computational  tools  have  been  developed  to  study  the 
dynamics of transposition at a population level, thus pro-
viding critical insights into the mechanisms behind genome 
evolution. Finally, combining the genomic materials from 
diverse individuals followed by high-throughput sequencing 
can  enhance  the  significance  of  characterizing  genomic 
polymorphisms in a population [23].

In  this  review,  we will  provide updates  on our  current 
understanding of the roles of TEs in genome evolution and 
genetic instability. Further, we focus on how their activity 
affects gene expression and causes disease states in human 
beings.

Role of Retrotransposons in Human Genome 
Evolution

Brain evolution is an important process that accelerated 
the  evolution  of  humans.  This  occurred  due  to  natural 
selection and genomic variation, a major source of which has 
been TE insertions. TE insertions contributed markedly to 
variation  and  increased  the  speed  of  evolution  [24-26]. 
Furthermore,  they  increase  the  recombination  rate,  in 
addition to affecting genes and their expression [24, 26]. 
From an evolutionary perspective, humans are unique in the 
speed of evolution and the number and activity of TEs. It is 
proposed  that  the  high  frequency  of  TE  insertions  is 
responsible at least in part for the rapid evolution of humans. 
It is speculated that some sets of genes might have been 
activated  or  suppressed  due  to  variations  caused  by  TE 
insertions, which in turn increased the chances for evolution 
[13].  There  has  been  a  prominent  impact  of  retrotrans-
posons  on  human  evolution  at  the  genomic  level.  Retro-
transposons have shaped human evolution at the RNA level 
through various mechanisms, such as modulation of gene 
expression, RNA editing, and epigenetic regulation [27].

LTR retrotransposons

In humans, LTR retrotransposons are called HERVs (Fig. 
1), which constitute 5% of the genome. The human genome 
shows  99%  similarity  with  chimpanzees  and  bonobos. 
Hence, the differences between these species are likely to be 
in regulatory sequences: promoters, enhancers, polyadeny-
lation signals, and transcription factor (TF) binding sites. 
The  LTRs  of  HERVs  help  in  regulating  the  expression  of 
nearby genes. The active human-specific LTRs that have been 
identified belong to the HERV-K family. It is proposed that 
some of these endogenous retroviruses may have integrated 
into regulatory regions of the human genome and that they 
eventually  contributed  to  human  evolution  [28].  Khodo-
sevich et al. [28] suggested that regulatory sequences found 
in  retroviral  LTRs  may  alter  the  expression  of  (or  even 
inactivate)  adjacent  genes.  On  the  other  hand,  HERV 
insertion  may  benefit  the  host,  for  example,  by  reverting 
harmful mutation [28].

Non-LTR retrotransposon

Human non-LTR retroposons include both active (L1, Alu, 
and SVA) and inactive elements (L2 and mammalian-wide 
interspersed repeat). Although more than 500,000 copies of 
L1  elements  are  found  in  the  human  genome,  only  100 
copies are known to be intact [29]. An intact L1 element is 
approximately  6  kilobases  (kb)  in  length,  with  a  5'  un-
translated region (UTR) containing an internal RNA poly-
merase II promoter, two open reading frames (ORF1 and 

ORF2), and a 3' UTR (Fig. 1) [29, 30]. L1 elements are the 
only autonomous TEs in the human genome because of their 
retrotransposition  property,  called  target-primed  reverse 
transcription [27]. Alu elements are often called “a parasite’s 
parasite,” because they do not code for a polymerase and, 
hence, are non-autonomous in nature. Alu elements depend 
on L1 elements for retrotransposition machinery [31-33]. 
However, they are considered the most successful TEs in the 
human genome in terms of copy number [27]. An intact SVA 
element is approximately 2 kb in length, which includes a 
hexamer  repeat,  an  Alu-like  region,  a  variable  number  of 
tandem  repeats,  and  a  HERV-K10-like  sequence.  SVA 
elements are also non-autonomous and most likely depend 
on L1 retrotransposition machinery [34, 35].

Two key features of non-LTR retrotransposons that con-
trol retrotransposition activity are high copy number and 
continued activity over millions of years [5, 27]. From an 
evolutionary perspective, the observed uniqueness of non- 
LTR retrotransposons is due to their vertical transfer in both 
primates  and  mammals  [4,  5,  36].  Amplification  rates 
among non-LTR retrotransposons are not uniform (Alu, 40 
Mya; L1, 12－40 Mya; SVA, 6 Mya) [27]. Among non-LTR 
retrotransposons,  Alu  elements  are  the  most  thoroughly 
studied  in  relation  to  evolution.  Alu  repeats  may  cause 
genomic diversity in various ways. Their amplification has 
enabled  them  to  become  the  largest  family  of  mobile 
elements in the human genome. It is estimated that thou-
sands  of  Alu  elements  have  integrated  into  the  human 
genome since the divergence of humans and African apes 
[37-40]. Although some Alu insertions have caused harmful 
mutations, most have contributed to genetic diversity [8]. 
Moreover, Alu repeats have also influenced the accumulation 
of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genome [30, 40, 
41]. From previous reports, it is evident that most of the 
recent Alu insertions are the source of genetic variations, 
which have been useful for studying both the relationships 
between populations and the evolution and organization of 
tandem-arrayed gene families [37-40]. Batzer and Deninger 
[42] suggested that the Alu insertion, in relation to genetic 
variation, may also be useful in generating species-specific 
genetic markers.

Roles of TEs in Genomic Instability and Dis-
ease States

TEs can cause genomic instability either by insertions or 
by  rearrangements  in  the  genome.  Notably,  structural 
variations in the human genome are the primary cause of 
inter-individual  variability.  Structural  variations  include 
insertion,  deletion,  inversion,  duplication,  and  translo-
cation. The characteristics of TEs, such as abundance in the 

100

genome, high sequence identity, and ability to move, make 
them major contributors to genomic instability [5, 27, 43]. 
Recent  studies  have  revealed  the  implications  of  TEs  in 
genomic  instability  and  human  genome  evolution  [44]. 
Mutations associated with TE insertions are well studied, 
and  approximately  0.3%  of  all  mutations  are  caused  by 
retrotransposon  insertions  [27].  Such  insertions  can  be 
deleterious by disrupting the regulatory sequences of a gene. 
When a TE inserts within an exon, it may change the ORF, 
such that it codes for an aberrant peptide, or it may even 
cause missense or nonsense mutations. On the other hand, 
if  it  is  inserted  into  an  intronic  region,  it  may  cause  an 
alternative splicing event by introducing novel splice sites, 
disrupting  the  canonical  splice  site,  or  introducing  a 
polyadenylation signal [8-11, 42, 43]. In some instances, TE 
insertion  into  intronic  regions  can  cause  mRNA  des-
tabilization, thereby reducing gene expression [45]. Simil-
arly, some studies have suggested that TE insertion into the 
5' or 3' region of a gene may alter its expression [46-48]. 
Thus, such a change in gene expression may, in turn, change 
the equilibrium of regulatory networks and result in disease 
conditions (reviewed in Konkel and Batzer [43]).

Alu, are reported to be the causative factors of many genetic 
disorders,  such  as  hemophilia,  Apert  syndrome,  familial 
hypercholesterolemia, and colon and breast cancer (Table 1) 
[8, 10, 11, 27]. Among the reported TE-mediated genetic 
disorders,  X-linked  diseases  are  more  abundant  than 
autosomal diseases [11, 27, 45], most of which are caused by 
L1  insertions.  However,  the  phenomenon  behind  L1  and 
X-linked genetic disorders has not yet been revealed. The 
breast cancer 2 (BRCA2) gene, associated with breast and 
ovarian  cancers,  has  been  reported  to  be  disrupted  by 
multiple non-LTR TE insertions [9, 18, 49]. There are some 
reports  that  the  same  location  of  a  gene  may  undergo 
multiple  insertions  (e.g.,  Alu  and  L1  insertions  in  the 
adenomatous polyposis coli gene) (Table 1). 

It has also been proposed that inverted repeats are likely to 
be hotspots of genomic instability [50]. Closely occurring 
Alu  repeats  form  hairpin  structures  that  are  prone  to 
double-strand  breaks  (DSBs)  and  excision  [50,  51].  In 
addition,  de  novo  Alu  insertions  may  create  new  inverted 
repeats that result in rearrangements in future generations 
[43]. Due to the abundance of TEs in the human genome, the 
probability  of  TE-mediated  NAHR  translocations  is  high. 
Kolomietz et al. [52] reported that Alu elements are often 
found in and around the breakage points of translocations 
and result in diseases [53]. Some studies have analyzed the 
human genome using the chimpanzee reference genome and 
found that deletions that are caused by Alu-mediated NAHRs 
are 9 times more frequent than L1-mediated NAHRs in the 
human genome [54, 55]. Alu-mediated NAHRs are known 
to be associated with various genetic disorders and cancer 
(Table 1) [8, 10]. L1 endonuclease creates abundant DSBs 
that are required for retrotransposition in mammalian cells 
and eventually contribute to genomic instability [56]. How-
ever, it has been difficult to define this in an experimental 
condition, as physiological conditions cannot be simulated in 
vitro. Moreover, it is also difficult to distinguish DSBs caused 
by L1 from DSBs caused by other mechanisms in vivo [44, 
56].
From recent studies, it is apparent that the methylation 
state  of  DNA  is  associated  with  cancer  [57].  TEs−in 
particular, the promoters of L1 elements−are reported to be 
demethylated in cancer cells [58, 59]. On the other hand, the 
methylation of retrotransposons is supposed to be a defense 
mechanism against retrotransposition in somatic cells [60]. 
It  has  also  been  reported  by  some  studies  that  the  L1 
transcription  rate  is  increased  in  hypomethylated  cancer 
cells [58, 61]. Demethylation of TE promoters may result in 
their activation, which in turn could modify the TF level in 
the cell. It is possible that such changes in TF levels lead to 
alterations  in  global  gene  expression  [57].  In  addition, 
demethylation  may  result  in  the  activation  of  the  L1

antisense promoter, which may eventually produce cancer- 
associated chimeric transcripts [62, 63].

Conclusion and Future Perspectives

Taken  together,  the  mechanisms  discussed  above  have 
demonstrated  the  considerable  impact  of  TEs  on  human 
genome evolution, genetic instability, and disease occurrence. 
There has been a recent increase in studies demonstrating 
the  roles  of  TEs  in  multiple  molecular  processes.  Impor-
tantly, several studies have found an association between 
TEs  and  cancer  conditions.  Technological  developments 
have  led  to  promising  techniques  (e.g.,  next-generation 
sequencing) that will assist researchers in studying, under-
standing, and confirming the role of TEs in genetic instability 
and diseases. Such progress may lead to the development of 
novel  therapeutic  strategies  in  the  near  future,  such  as 
personalized  gene  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  genetic 
disorders. The clinical community has already realized the 
importance of personalized cancer treatments and is moving 
toward excellence in such treatment strategies. Therefore, 
we believe that in-depth studies on the role(s) of TEs in 
evolution,  the  epigenetic  control  of  gene  expression,  and 
clinical  aspects  will  be  of  paramount  importance  in 
uncovering  novel  mechanisms  that  can  be  targeted  for 
therapeutic intervention.
