Introduction

Blood  pressure  is  regulated  by  many  genetic  and  envi-
ronmental  factors.  To  identify  genes  that  mediate  this 
regulation,  genomewide  association  studies  (GWASs) 
have  been  performed  using  large  samples  from  various 
ethnicities.  The  Wellcome  Trust  Case  Control  Consor-
tium  (WTCCC)  (WTCCC,  2007),  Amish  study  (Wang  et 
al.,  2009),  KORA  (Org  et al.,  2009),  KARE  (Cho  et al., 
2009),  the  Global  BPgen  consortium  (Newton-Cheh  et 
al.,  2009),  and  the  CHARGE  consortium  (Levyt  et al., 
2009)  have  conducted  GWASs  on  hypertension  and 
blood  pressure,  identifying  14  independent  loci  that  gov-
ern  blood  pressure  that  reached  genomewide  sig-
nificance:  6  enzymes,  2  solutes  channels,  2  transcription 
factors,  1  growth  factor,  1  cell  signaling  protein,  1  struc-
tural  protein,  and  1  hypothetical  gene  (reviewed  in  Ehret, 
2010). 
    The  CSK  (C-terminal  SRC  tyrosine  kinase)  locus  has 
repeatedly  been  linked  to  blood  pressure  in  Korean  and 
European  studies  (Fig.  1)  (Hong  et al.,  2010a;  Levy  et 
al.,  2009;  Newton-Cheh  et al.,  2009).  CSK  is  a  ubiq-
uitously  expressed  protein  tyrosine  kinase  that  is  related 
structurally  to  SRC  kinases  (Nada et al.,  1991).  The  Src 
family  of  kinases  (SFKs)  comprises  9  members  (c-src,

Abstract

C-terminal  SRC  kinase  (CSK)  is  a  ubiquitously  ex-
pressed,  cytosolic  enzyme  that  phosphorylates  and  in-
activates  several  SRC  family  protein  tyrosine  kinases. 
Recent  genomewide  association  studies  have  implicated 
CSK  in  the  regulation  of  blood  pressure.  The  current 
study  aim  is  to  determine  the  blood  pressure  associa-
tion  of  the  genes  regulated  by  CSK  down-regulation. 
The  CSK  mRNA  expression  was  downregulated  in  vas-
cular  smooth  muscle  cells  using  small  interfering  RNA 
(siRNA).  CSK  mRNA  levels  fell  by  90%  in  cells  that  were 
treated  with  CSK  siRNA;  the  RNA  from  these  cells  was 
examined  by  microarray  using  the  Illumina  HumanRef-8 
v3  platform,  which  comprises  24,526  reference  mRNA 
probes.  On  treatment  with  CSK  siRNA,  19  genes  were 
downregulated  by  more  than  2-fold  and  13  genes  were 
upregulated  by  more 
(CANX, 
SLC30A7,  and  HMOX1)  of  them  revealed  more  than  3 
fold  differential  expression.  Interestingly,  the  HMOX1 
SNPs  were  associated  with  diastolic  blood  pressure  in 
the  7551  Koreans  using  Korea  Association  REsource 
data,  and  the  result  was  supported  by  the  other  reports 
that  HMOX1  linked  to  blood  vessel  maintenance.  Among 
the  remaining  29  differentially  expressed  genes,  seven 
(SSBP1,  CDH2,  YWHAE,  ME2,  PFTK1,  G3BP2,  and 
TUFT1)  revealed  association  with  both  systolic  and  dia-
stolic  blood  pressures.  The  CDH2  gene  was  linked  to 
blood  pressures.  Conclusively,  we  identified  32  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  which  were  regulated  by  CSK 
reduction,  and  two  (HOMX1  and  CDH2)  of  them  might 
influence  the  blood  pressure  regulation  through  CSK 
pathway.

similar  C-terminal  domains  that  are  phosphorylated  by 
CSK  (Cheng  et al.,  1996).  SFKs  regulate  signal  trans-
duction  through  diverse  cell  surface  receptors  in  many 
environments  (reviewed  in  Parsons  and  Parsons,  2004).
    CSK-mediated  phosphorylation  of  SFKs  at  their  regu-
latory  tyrosine  inhibits  their  kinase  activity.  Many  reports 
have  documented  the  importance  of  CSK  in  cellular  de-
velopment  and  the  growth  control  (Chow  and  Veillette, 
1995;  Imamoto  and  Soriano,  1993;  Nada  et al.,  1993). 
Studies  in  CSK-deficient  mice  have  shown  that  CSK 
regulates  embryonic  development,  particularly  the  cen-
tral  nervous  system  (Imamoto  and  Soriano,  1993).  The 
CSK-deficient  mice  have  also  shown  that  CSK  is  re-
quired  both  for  angiogenic  sprouting  and  vascular  re-
modeling  (Duan et al.,  2004).  In  addition,  the  critical  role 
of  c-SRC  signaling  pathway  was  reported  in  angiotensin 
II-mediated  vascular  smooth  muscle  cell  proliferation 
(Sayeski  and  Ali,  2003). 
    To  understand  the  CSK  function  in  blood  pressure 
regulation,  we  reduced  CSK  mRNA  expression  in  the 
human  vascular  smooth  muscle  cells  (VSMCs)  using 
CSK  siRNA,  examined  the  expression  profile  of  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  by  microarray,  and  an-
alyzed  the  genetic  association  of  DEGs  with  blood  pres-
sure  traits.  DEGs  in  the  VSMCs  downregulated  by  CSK 
could  be  candidate  genes  responsible  for  the  blood 
pressure  regulation  through  CSK  signaling.  Among  the 
DEGs,  of  course  there  may  be  genes  irrelevant  to  the 
blood  pressure  regulation,  but  other  cellular  controls 
through  CSK.  Therefore,  we  performed  the  association 
study  of  DEGs  with  the  blood  pressure  to  determine 
which  DEGs  are  involved  in  the  blood  pressure  regu-
lation  in  this  study.

Methods

Cell  culture  and  reagents
Human  vascular  smooth  muscle  cell  lines  (CRL-1999TM- 
T/G  HA-VSMC)  were  purchased  from  American  Type 
Culture  Collection  (ATCC,  Manassas,  VA).  Cell  lines 
were  cultured  in  Kaighn’s-modified  Ham’s  F-12K  me-
dium  (ATCC,  Manassas,  VA)  with  0.05  mg/ml  ascorbic 
acid,  0.01  mg/ml  insulin,  0.01  mg/ml  transferrin,  10  ng/ 
ml  sodium  selenite,  0.03  mg/ml  endothelial  cell  growth 
supplement,  10  mM  HEPES,  10  mM  TES  (Sigma,  St. 
Louis,  MO),  100×  antibiotic-antimycotic  (Gibco,  Grand 
Island,  NY),  and  10%  fetal  bovine  serum  (Thermo  Fisher 
Scientific,  Waltham,  MA)  in  a  humidified  incubator  at 
37oC  and  5%  CO2.

siRNA  design  and  transfection

An  siRNA  oligonucleotide  that  targeted  CSK  was  de-
signed  based  on  the  published  mRNA  sequence  of  CSK 
(nm  number)  and  synthesized  by  Genolution  Co.  Ltd. 
(Seoul,  Korea).  Scrambled  nontargeting  siRNA  was  also 
synthesized  by  Genolution  Co.  Ltd.  (Seoul,  Korea).  The 
CSK  siRNA  sequence  is  5'-CTGGCCATCCGGTACA-
GAA-3'.  Twenty-four  hours  before 
transfection, 
VSMCs  were  diluted  in  fresh  medium  without  antibiotics 
and  transferred  to  6-well  plates.  Cells  were  grown  to 
80%  confluence  and  transfected  with  150  nmol/L  (final 
concentration)  of  siRNA  using  Lipofectamine  RNAiMAX 
Transfection  Reagent  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA)  per  the 
manufacturer's  instructions.

the 

RNA  isolation  and  real-time  PCR

RNA  was  extracted  using  RNAiso  Plus  (Takara,  Shiga, 
Japan).  We  generated  cDNA  from  400  ng  of  total  RNA 
using  the  PrimeScriptTM  RT  reagent  kit  (TaKaRa,  Shiga, 
Japan)  used  per  the  manufacturer's  manual.  CSK  ex-
pression  was  analyzed  by  real-time  PCR.  One-tenth  of 
the  cDNA  reaction  was  added  to  a  final  volume  of  25 
μl  for  each  real-time  PCR  reaction  using  SYBR  Green 
I  (TaKaRa,  Shiga,  Japan).  The  primers  for  CSK  and 
GAPDH  were  (5'-ACCTCAGACGCAGATGGACT/AGCA-
TCACGTCTCCGAACTC-3')  and  (5'-GCTCTCTGCTCCT-
CCTGTTC/CAATACGACCAAATCCGTTG-3')  respectively 
(forward/reverse  sequence).
    Reactions  were  run  on  an  ABI  Step  One  real-time 
PCR  system  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  with 
the  following  program:  35  cycles  of  95oC  for  40s,  60oC 
for  40s,  and  72oC  for  40s.  All  reactions  were  performed 
in  triplicate.  The  significance  of  differences  in  relative 
levels  of  expression  was  determined  (p  ＜  0.05)  by 
two-way  analysis  of  variance.  The  size  of  the  RT-PCR 
products  was  analyzed  by  agarose  gel  electrophoresis 
(data  not  shown).

Labeling  and  purification  of  probe  for  microarray

Total  RNA  was  amplified  and  purified  using  the  Ambion 
Illumina  RNA  amplification  kit  (Ambion,  Austin,  USA)  to 
generate  biotinylated  cRNA  per 
the  manufacturer's 
instructions.  Briefly,  550  ng  of  total  RNA  was  re-
verse-transcribed  using  T7  oligo  (dT)  primer.  Second- 
strand  cDNA  was  synthesized,  in  vitro-transcribed,  and 
labeled  with  biotin-NTP.  After  purification,  the  cRNA  was 
quantified  on  an  ND-1000  spectrophotometer  (Nano-
Drop,  Wilmington,  USA).

Hybridization  and  data  export

Seven  hundred  fifty  nanograms  of  labeled  cRNA  was 
hybridized  to  each  human-8  expression  bead  array  for 
16-18  h  at  58oC,  per  the  manufacturer's  instructions 
(Illumina,  Inc.,  San  Diego,  USA).  Array  signals  were  de-
tected  using  Amersham  fluorolink  streptavidin-Cy3  (GE 
Healthcare  Bio-Sciences,  Little  Chalfont,  UK)  per  the 
bead  array  manual.  Arrays  were  scanned  on  an  Illumina 
Bead  Array  Reader  per  the  manufacturer's  instructions. 
Array  data  were  exported,  processed,  and  analyzed  us-
ing  Illumina  GenomeStudio  v2009.2  (Gene  Expression 
Module  v1.5.4).

Raw  data  preparation  and  statistical  analysis 

The  quality  of  hybridization  and  overall  chip  perform-
ance  was  monitored  by  visual  inspection  of  internal 
quality  control  checks  and  raw  scanned  data.  Raw  data 
were  extracted  using  the  software  that  was  provided  by 
the  manufacturer  (Illumina  GenomeStudio  v2009.2  (Gene 
Expression  Module  v1.5.4)).  Array  data  were  filtered  us-
ing  a  detection  p-value  ＜  0.05  (similar  to  signal-to- 
noise)  for  all  samples.  Selected  gene  signal  values  were 
log-transformed  and  normalized  by  a  quantile  method. 
The  comparative  analysis  between  test  group  and  con-
trol  group  was  evaluated  by  LPE  test  using  adjusted 
FDR  (false  discovery  rate)  p-values.  FDR  was  controlled 
by  adjusting  p-values  using  the  Benjamini-Hochberg 
algorithm.
    The  gene  ontology  analysis  was  performed  using 
PANTHER  (http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/ontologies. 
jsp),  using  text  files  containing  the  Gene  ID  list  and  ac-
cession  number  of  the  Illumina  probe  ID.  Gene  Set 
Enrichment  Analysis  (GSEA)  was  performed  if  an  a  pri-
ori-defined  set  of  genes  showed  differential  patterns 
with  regard  to  both  biological  process  and  molecular 
function.  One-tail  Fisher  exact  test  was  used  to  measure 
the  gene  enrichment  in  annotation  terms.  All  data  analy-
sis  and  visualization  of  differentially  expressed  genes 
were  conducted  using  R  2.4.1  (www.r-project.org).  The 
biological  ontology-based  analysis  was  performed  using 
the  Panther  database  (http://www.pantherdb.org).

Association  study  samples

The  KARE  subjects  and  their  genotypes  have  been  re-
ported  in  the  original  study  (Cho  et al.,  2009).  Briefly, 
7551  individuals  from  the  KyungGi-Do  province,  near 
Seoul,  Korea,  were  recruited  for  the  association  analysis 
between  blood  pressure  and  SNP  genotypes. 
    In  the  original  study,  blood  pressure  was  measured  3 

times  with  the  patient  in  the  supine  position.  Before  the 
first  measurement,  the  participants  rested  for  5  minutes, 
and  3  measurements  were  taken  at  least  30  seconds 
apart.  The  average  of  the  3  measurements  was  used  for 
this  study.  This  study  was  approved  by  the  International 
Review  Board  of  the  Korea  National  Institute  of  Health.

Genotypes  and  statistical  analysis

KARE  DNA  samples  from  the  original  study  were  iso-
lated  from  the  peripheral  blood  of  participants  and  gen-
otyped  using  the  Affymetrix  Genomewide  Human  SNP 
array  5.0  (Affymetrix,  Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  The 
quality  controls  have  been  described  elsewhere  (Cho et 
al.,  2009).  Briefly,  the  accuracy  of  the  genotyping  was 
calculated  by  Bayesian  robust  linear  modeling  using  the 
Mahalanobis  distance  (BRLMM)  genotyping  algorithm 
(Rabbee  and  Speed,  2006).
    Samples  that  had  accuracies  below  98%  and  a  high 
missing  genotype  call  rate  (≥ 4%),  high  heterozygosity 
(＞ 30%),  or  inconsistency  in  sex  were  excluded  from 
subsequent  analyses.  Individuals  who  had  a  tumor  or 
were  undergoing  antihypertensive  therapy  were  exclu-
ded.  Related  individuals  whose  estimated  identity-by- 
state  (IBS)  values  were  high  (＞ 0.80)  (WTCCC,  2007) 
were  also  excluded.  The  1956  SNPs  that  were  exam-
ined  in  this  study  were  extracted  from  the  KARE  geno-
type  data  if  they  lay  within  ±5  kb  of  the  genes  and  did 
not  deviate  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  (p 
＞ 1×10-6). 
    The  KARE  dataset,  comprising  351,677  SNPs  for 
7751  individuals,  was  merged  with  that  of  International 
HapMap  Phase  II  JPT  (Japanese)+HCB  (Chinese)  panel 
2.  The  genotypes  of  the  KARE  individuals  were  imputed 
using  IMPUTE  (Howie et al.,  2009)  as  described  (Hong 
et al.,  2010b)
    Most  statistical  analyses  were  performed  using  PLINK 
version  1.07  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) 
(Purcell et al.,  2007)  and  SAS  (version  9.1;  SAS  institute 
Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  Systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and 
diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  were  tested  for  their  as-
sociation  with  SNPs  by  linear  regression  analysis  with 
an  additive  model  (1-d.f.)  after  adjustments  for  area, 
age,  sex,  and  BMI  (Hong  et al.,  2010a;  Hong  et al., 
2010c).

Results

CSK  inhibition  by  siRNA

VSMCs  were  treated  with  CSK  siRNA  for  24  hr.  By 
quantitative  real-time  PCR  (qRT-PCR),  CSK  mRNA  levels 
fell  by  90%  compared  with  controls  that  were  treated

with  scramble  siRNA  (Fig.  2).
    Four  RNA  samples-from  2  CSK  siRNA-treated  (siCSK) 
and  2  scramble  siRNA-treated  (control)  groups  were  ex-
amined  by  microarray.  CSK  mRNA  levels  declined  in 
siCSK-treated  cells  by  approximately  80%  compared 
with  the  controls,  mirroring  the  reductions  in  VSMCs  by 
qRT-PCR. 

Expression  microarray  profiling

After  false  discovery  rate  (FDR)  correction,  the  expres-
sion  of  631  genes  changed  significantly  with  an  ad-
justed  p-value  ＜ 0.05  (288  genes  were  upregulated  and 
343  were  downregulated),  32  of  which  changed  their  ex-
pression  by  more  than  2-fold  (19  downregulated  and  13 
upregulated)  (Table  1).  Notably,  a  chaperone  protein 
(CANX:  calnexin)  and  a  zinc  ion  transporter  (SLC30A7: 
solute  carrier  family  30  member  7)  decreased  their  ex-
pression  by  more  than  3-fold  (-3.85  ±  0.17  and  -3.11 
±  0.08,  respectively);  conversely,  an  oxidoreductase 
(HMOX1:  heme  oxygenase  (decycling)  1)  increased  its 
expression  by  greater  than  3-fold  (3.15±0.44).

Gene  ontology  analysis  of  DEGs 

We  analyzed  the  ontology  of  DEGs  with  regard  to  bio-
logical  process  (Fig.  3).  A  gene  set  enrichment  analysis 
(GSEA)  of  biological  processes  was  also  performed  (the 
results  are  marked  with  *  over  the  process  in  Fig.  3A, 
B,  and  C).  Two  biological  processes-signal  transduction 
and  development-were  significantly  enriched  in  upregu-
lated  DEGs  (Fig.  3B),  and  6  categories-signal  trans-
duction,  phosphate  metabolism,  immunity  and  defense, 
homeostasis,  development,  and  cell  cycle-were  repre-
sented  in  downregulated  DEGs  (Fig.  3C).
    In  the  GSEA,  one  molecular  function  (signaling  mole-

cule)  was  significantly  enriched  in  upregulated  DEGs 
(Fig.  3E),  and  4  functions  (signaling  molecule,  receptor, 
kinase,  and  ion  channel)  were  preferential  in  down-
regulated  DEGs  (Fig.  3F).

Genetic  association  analysis

We  analyzed  the  genetic  association  of  the  32  DEGs 
(differentially  expressed  by  more  than  2-fold)  in  Table  1 
with  blood  pressure  traits  in  7551  Koreans.  We  obtained 
1956  SNPs  in  the  DEGs  from  Korean  Association 
REsource  (KARE)  data  (Table  2)  and  examined  their  as-
sociation  with  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and  dia-
stolic  blood  pressure  (DBP),  controlling  for  cohort,  age, 
sex,  and  BMI  as  covariates.  The  clinical  characteristics 
of  the  subjects  are  described  in  Table  3.
    Three  hundred  ninety-one  SNPs  from  16  genes  were 
linked  to  SBP  or  DBP  at  p-value  ＜ 0.05.  Among  them, 
two  SNPs  (rs2071746  and  rs2071748)  of  HMOX1  gene, 
the  most  increased  its  expression  by  CSK  down  regu-
lation,  were  associated  with  diastolic  blood  pressure 
(Table  4).  Seven  of  less  regulated  genes  (3  ＞  |fold 
change|  ＞  2)  genes  (SSBP1,  CDH2,  YWHAE,  ME2, 
PFTK1,  G3BP2,  and  TUFT1)  were  correlated  with  both 
SBP  and  DBP,  and  the  minor  allele  frequencies  of  their 
associated  SNPs  were  higher  than  0.05  (Table  5).

Discussion

By  microarray,  we  examined  DEGs  in  siCSK-treated 
cells.  The  gene-set  enrichment  analysis  revealed  that 
the  signaling  molecules  were  greatly  changed  in  the  ex-
pression  by  the  CSK  reduction.  Among  the  DEGs,  thir-
ty-two  genes  in  Table  1  were  differentially  expressed  by 
more  than  2-fold,  and  calnexin  (CANX),  a  molecular 
chaperone,  experienced 
the  most  extensive  down-

ing,  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER)-associated  protein  that 
interacts  transiently  with  newly  synthesized  N-linked  gly-

coproteins,  facilitating  protein  folding  and  assembly

known  as  neuronal  cadherin  (N-cadherin),  is  a  classical 
member  of  the  cadherin  superfamily  (Reid  and  Hemper-
ly,  1990).  It  is  a  calcium-dependent  cell-cell  adhesion 
glycoprotein  that  comprises  5  extracellular  cadherin  re-
peats,  a  transmembrane  region,  and  a  highly  conserved 
cytoplasmic  tail  (Garcia-Castro et al.,  2000).  Deletion  of 
N-cadherin  from  mouse  endothelium  results  in  vascular 
defects,  leading  to  midgestational  embryonic  lethality, 
implying  that  it  regulates  blood  pressure  (Luo  and 
Radice,  2005).
    The  SSBP1  is  a  single-stranded  DNA  binding  protein, 
and  is  a  housekeeping  gene  involved  in  mitochondrial 
biogenesis  (Tiranti  et al.,  1995).  It  is  also  a  subunit  of 
a  single-stranded  DNA  (ssDNA)-binding  complex  invol-
ved  in  the  maintenance  of  genome  stability  (Huang  et 
al.,  2009).  The  YWHAE  gene  belongs  to  the  14-3-3  fam-
ily  of  proteins  which  mediate  signal  transduction  by 
binding  to  phosphoserine-containing  proteins  (Ikeda  et 
al.,  2008).  The  ME2  gene  encodes  Mitochondrial 
NAD(+)-dependent  malic  enzyme  (EC  1.1.1.39),  and 
linked  to  the  conversion  of  amino  acid  carbon  to  pyr-
uvate  (Loeber  et al.,  1991).  The  TUFT1  has  been  sug-
gested  to  play  an  important  role  during  the  development 
and  mineralization  of  enamel  (Mao  et al.,  2001).  The 
G3BP2  gene  is  a  member  of  GTPase-activating  protein 
SH3  domain  binding  protein  family  and  unwound  DNA/ 
DNA,  RNA/DNA,  and  RNA/RNA  substrates  (Costa et al., 
1999).  The  PFTK1  is  a  member  of  the  CDC2-related 
protein  kinase  family,  and  involved  in  the  control  of  the 

(-3.11  ±  0.08-fold).  ZnT7,  a  novel  member  of  the  zinc 
transporter  (ZnT)  family,  localizes  to  the  Golgi  apparatus 
and  cytoplasmic  vesicles,  suggesting  that  ZnT7  medi-
ates  zinc  transport  from  the  cytoplasm  into  the  Golgi 
(Kirschke  and  Huang,  2003).  In  spite  of  the  great  differ-
ential  expression,  the  association  studies  of  both  CANX 
and  ZnT7/SLC30A7  with  blood  pressure  in  Koreans 
were  not  significant.  Possibly  these  genes  may  be  in-
volved  in  the  cellular  controls  through  CSK  signaling, 
but  irrelevant  to  the  blood  pressure  regulation.
    On  the  other  hand,  heme  oxygenase  1  (HMOX1),  the 
most  significantly  upregulated  (3.15  ±  0.44-fold),  was 
associated  with  diastolic  blood  pressure,  indicating  its 
involvement  in  the  blood  pressure  regulation  through 
CSK.  Heme  oxygenase,  an  essential  enzyme  in  heme 
catabolism,  cleaves  heme  to  form  biliverdin,  which  is 
subsequently  converted 
to  bilirubin  and  carbon 
monoxide,  a  putative  neurotransmitter  (Yoshida  et al., 
1988).  Human  HMOX1  polymorphisms  were  linked  to 
the  risk  of  coronary  artery  disease  in  type  II  diabetes 
patients (Chen et al., 2002). Also, HMOX1 overexpression in 
VSMCs  protects 
radical  attack, 
implicating  HMOX1  in  the  maintenance  of  blood  vessel 
(Zhang  et al.,  2002). 
    Seven  gene  loci  such  as  SSBP1,  CDH2,  YWHAE, 
ME2,  TUFT1,  C3BP2  and  PFTK1  showed  the  associa-
tion  tendency  with  both  SBP  and  DBP.  Based  on  a  liter-
ature  search,  CDH2  among  these  genes  appears  to  re-
lated  to  the  regulation  of  blood  pressure.  CDH2,  also

eukaryotic  cell  cycle,  whose  activity  is  controlled  by  an 
associated  cyclin  (Shu et al.,  2007).  Even  though  these 

genes  were  found  their  association  with  blood  pressure 
in  this  study,  we  could  not  find  previous  reports  about 
these  six  genes  related  to  the  vascular  function  as  well 
as  blood  pressure.
    Our  study  limitation  is  that  none  of  the  391  asso-
ciated  SNPs  passed  the  multiple  correction  criteria 
(Bonferroni  p-value  ＜ 2.6  ×  10-5).  Therefore,  the  further 
replication  study  will  be  necessary  and  awaiting  for  the 
functional  analysis  validating  these  findings.
    Conclusively,  we  identified  32  differentially  expressed 
genes  which  were  regulated  by  CSK  reduction,  and  two 
(HOMX1  and  CDH2)  of  them  might  be  influence  the 
blood  pressure  regulation  through  CSK  pathway.
