Abstract

Single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  are  the  most 
abundant  forms  of  human  genetic  variations  and  re-
sources  for  mapping  complex  genetic  traits  and  disease 
association  studies.  We  have  constructed  a  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  map  of  chromosome  22  in  Korean  sam-
ples  and  compared  it  with  those  of  other  populations, 
including  Yorubans  in  Ibadan,  Nigeria  (YRI),  Centre 
d'Etude  du  Polymorphisme  Humain  (CEPH)  reference 
families  (CEU),  Japanese  in  Tokyo  (JPT)  and  Han 
Chinese  in  Beijing  (CHB)  in  the  HapMap  database.  We 
genotyped  4681  of  111,448  publicly  available  SNPs  in 
90  unrelated  Koreans.  Among  genotyped  SNPs,  4167 
were  polymorphic.  Three  hundred  and  five  LD  blocks 
were  constructed  to  make  up  18.6%  (6.4  of  34.5  Mb)  of 
chromosome  22  with  757  tagSNPs  and  815  haplotypes 
(frequency  ≥ 5.0%).  Of  3430  common  SNPs  genotyped

in  all  five  populations,  514  were  monomorphic  in  Ko-
reans.  The  CHB  +  JPT  samples  have  more  than  a  72% 
overlap  with  the  monomorphic  SNPs  in  Koreans,  while 
the  CEU  +  YRI  samples  have  less  than  a  38%  overlap. 
The  patterns  of  hot  spots  and  LD  blocks  were  dispersed 
throughout  chromosome  22,  with  some  common  blocks 
among  populations,  highly  concordant  between  the 
three  Asian  samples.  Analysis  of  the  distribution  of 
chimpanzee-derived  allele  frequency  (DAF),  a  measure 
of  genetic  differentiation,  Fst  levels,  and  allele  frequency

ples  showed  a  strong  correlation  between  the  Asians, 
while  the  CEU  and  YRI  samples  showed  a  very  weak 
correlation  with  Korean  samples.  Relative  distance  as  a 
quantitative  measurement  based  upon  DAF,  Fst,  and 
AFD  indicated  that  all  three  Asian  samples  are  very 
proximate,  while  CEU  and  YRI  are  significantly  remote 
from  the  Asian  samples.  Comparative  genome-wide  LD 
studies  provide  useful  information  on  the  association 
studies  of  complex  diseases.

Introduction

Vast  amounts  of  information  on  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNPs)  and  progress  in  high-throughput  gen-
otyping  technology  have  generated  a  great  deal  of  inter-
est  in  establishing  genome-wide  linkage  disequilibrium 
(LD)  maps  for  genetic  studies  of  complex  traits  (Chakra-
varti  2001;  The  International  HapMap  Consortium  2003; 
Myers  and  Bottolo  2005).  LD  is  known  to  occur  in  a 
block-like  structure  across  the  genome,  with  conserved 
haplotype  blocks  of  tens  to  hundreds  of  kilobases  punc-
tuated  by  "hot  spots"  of  recombination  (Daly  et al. 
2001).  Since  the  concept  of  whole  genome  association 
studies  using  SNPs  was 
(Risch  and 
Merikangas  1996),  an  optimal  number  of  SNPs  required 
for  association  studies  has  been  center  of  extensive  de-
bate  (Kruglyak  1999).  Initial  studies  have  focused  on 
average  LD  levels  and  the  variability  in  processes  that 
generate  LD  (Cardon  and  Abecasis  2003).  Although  a 
single  chromosome  could  carry  many  haplotypes  in  LD 
blocks,  recent  studies  suggest  that  haplotypic  variation 
may  be  much  lower  than  previously  imagined  (Jeffreys 
et al.  2001;  Patil et al.  2001;  Gabriel et al.  2002).  Patil's 
group  identified  haplotype  blocks  on  chromosome  21 

introduced 

for  which  over  80%  of  chromosomes  were  represented 
by  a  few  common  haplotypes  (Patil et al.  2001).  In  the 
analysis  of  human  chromosome  22  with  a  marker  den-
sity  of  one  SNP  per  15  kb,  Dawson's  group  reported  a 
highly  variable  pattern  of  LD  along  the  chromosome,  in 
which  extensive  regions  of  complete  LD  of  up  to  804  kb 
in  length  were  interspersed  with  regions  of  no  detect-
able  LD  (Dawson  et al.  2002).  Although  differences  of 
LD  patterns  between  populations  have  been  reported 
(Abecasis et al.  2002;  Reich et al.  2001,  Zavattari et al. 
2002),  little  information  is  available  on  the  haplotype 
structure  in  different  populations  other  than  the  recent 
study  by  S.B.  Gabriel, et al.  (Gabriel et al.  2002).  On  the 
other  hand,  haplotype  analysis  has  been  widely  em-
ployed  in  linkage  studies  for  narrowing  down  the  loca-
tion  of  disease  susceptibility  genes  (Zhang  et al.  2004; 
Park  2007).
    The  International  HapMap  Project  was  launched  to 
develop  a  haplotype  map  of  the  human  genome,  the 
HapMap,  which  will  describe  the  common  patterns  of 
human  DNA  sequence  variation  among  four  population 
samples:  30  trios  from  Yoruba  in  Ibadan,  Nigeria  (YRI), 
45  unrelated  Japanese  in  Tokyo,  Japan  (JPT),  45  un-
related  Han  Chinese  in  Beijing,  China  (CHB),  and  30 
trios  in  a  Utah,  US  population  with  Northern  and  Wes-
tern  European  ancestry  (CEU)  from  the  CEPH  collection 
(The  International  HapMap  Consortium  2003;  2004; 
2007).  As  the  International  HapMap  Project  releases  a 
validated  SNP  map  of  1  marker  per  kb  for  the  HapMap 
samples,  the  general  applicability  of  the  HapMap  data 
needs  to  be  confirmed  in  samples  from  related  popu-
lations.  Recent  comparative  studies  of  LD  patterns  have 
shown  a  high  degree  of  concordance  among  various 
populations  (Gabriel  et al.  2002;  Shifman  et al.  2003; 
Stenzel et al.  2004;  Mueller et al.  2005).  As  the  HapMap 
samples  include  Japanese  and  Chinese,  it  was  our  in-
terest  to  test  whether  significant  differences  in  LD  exist 
between  Koreans  and  the  two  other  Asian  samples. 
    In  this  paper,  we  measured  the  LD  pattern  along 
chromosome  22  in  Korean  samples  and  compared  the 
Korean  data  with  those  of  the  four  HapMap  samples. 
We  were  interested  in  exploring  how  the  HapMap  data 
could  be  used  to  estimate  the  genomic  structure  of 
Koreans.  We  expect  that  this  study  will  contribute  to  the 
development  of  proper  strategies  for  association  studies 
of  common  complex  diseases  in  Koreans  using  the 
HapMap  data. 

Methods

SNP  Selection

Comparison  of  Korean  LD  Map  of  Chromosome  22    19

in  the  dbSNP  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP,  build 
116)  were  collected.  To  maximize  cost  effectiveness  of 
genotyping,  SNPs  were  selected  based  on  the  following 
criteria:  1)  markers  with  even  spacing,  2)  verified  SNPs, 
3)  coding  SNPs.  The  SNPs  were  scored  for  the  se-
lection  of  the  study  using  the  following  strategies.  First, 
it  was  most  important  in  mapping  chromosomal  LD 
blocks  to  have  relatively  equal  spaces  between  SNP 
markers.  Second,  verified  SNP  markers  (validation  status 
was  scored  as  0  to  4  in  the  dbSNP)  that  had  higher 
scores  were  chosen  to  prevent  or  reduce  genotyping 
failure.  Also,  repeated  sequence  regions  were  excluded 
by  repeat  masking  with  Primer3  software  (Rozen  and 
Skaletsky  2000).  Third,  to  be  useful  for  a  further  study, 
protein  coding  SNPs  had  higher  scores.  A  total  of 
12,674  genotyping  experiments  were  conducted  by  four 
Genotyping  Centers,  and  a  final  set  of  4681  markers 
passed  the  stringent  quality  control  procedure  (The 
International  HapMap  Consortium  2003). 

DNA  Samples

Genomic  DNA  from  90  unrelated  Korean  individuals 
without  family  histories  of  major  diseases  was  obtained 
from  the  Genomic  Research  Center  in  the  Korean 
National  Institute  of  Health  (KNIH).  The  KNIH  samples 
were  collected  as  part  of  an  epidemiological  project  and 
represent  urban  and  rural  regions  in  the  south  of  Seoul. 
The  sex  ratio  was  0.5  and  the  mean  age  was  50. 
Informed  consent  from  all  participating  subjects  was  ob-
tained  through  KNIH,  and  research  approval  came  from 
the  relevant  ethical  committees.  DNA  was  isolated  from 
peripheral  blood  leukocytes  according  to  standard  pro-
cedures  with  proteinase  K-RNase  digestion,  followed  by 
phenol-chloroform  extraction.

Genotyping

For  each  SNP,  we  chose  a  set  of  three  primers:  two 
PCR  primers  to  amplify  a  product  of  100-200  bps  under 
standard  conditions  and  an  optimized  extension  primer 
to  be  complementary  to  the  sequence  immediately  to  a 
SNP  site. 
    For  genotyping,  we  employed  three  platforms-6063 
SNP  genotypings  were  done  using  the  Orchid  Biosci-
ence  SNP-ITTM  assay  (Princeton,  NJ),  984  SNP  genotyp-
ings  using  the  PerkinElmer  Life  Sciences  FP-TDI  assay 
(Boston,  MA),  and  5627  SNP  genotypings  using  the 
Sequenom  MassARRAYTM  (San  Diego,  CA).

consistency  between  the  observed  values  and  those  ex-
pected  from  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  test  in 
each  assay.  Haploview  version  3.2  (Barrett et al.  2004), 
based  on  the  expectation-maximization  (EM)  method 
(Excoffier  and  Slatkin  1995),  was  used  to  infer  haplotype 
phase  and  population  frequency  and  to  estimate  the 

Lewontin's  coefficients  D'  (Lewontin  1998),  LOD,  and 
correlation  coefficient  r 
(Hill  and  Robertson  1968). 
PHASE  v2.1  was  used  to  estimate  the  recombination 
parameters  (Li  and  Stephens  2003;  Crawford  et al. 
2004)  and  assess  the  statistical  significance  of  hap-
lotype  profile  differences  and  individual  haplotype  fre-

and  Donnelly  2003).  Hot  spots  were  evaluated  to  have 
a  recombination  rate  greater  than  or  equal  to  10 
(Crawford  et al.  2004).  Derived  allele  frequency  (DAF) 
was  estimated  by  comparing  major  human  alleles  with 
the  Chimpanzee  reference  allele  downloaded  from  the 
UCSC  database  and  by  considering  human  minor  allele 
frequency  as  DAF,  when  both  alleles  are  the  same.  DAF 
correlation  between  populations  was  calculated  using 
the  Pearson  product-moment  correlation  implemented  in 
R  language.  Fst  was  calculated  according  to  Wright's 
F-statistics  (Wright  1951).  Korean  variation  patterns  of 
SNPs  were  compared  with  those  of  the  HapMap  sam-
ples  including  CEU,  CHB,  JPT,  and  YRI  in  the  HapMap 
database.  Neighbor-joining  trees  of  average  Fst  and 
correlation  of  DAF  and  AFD  among  populations  were 
constructed  by  PhyloDraw  (Choi  et al.  2000).

Results

Genomic  variation  analysis

For  Build  116  of  the  dbSNP,  111,448  SNPs  in  human 
chromosome  22  were  available.  In  order  to  select  an 
evenly  spaced  subset  of  SNPs  that  maximized  the  pow-
er  of  calculating  LD  maps,  we  screened  the  SNP  set  to 
remove  ambiguous  positions  (2642),  non  bi-allelic  SNPs 
(5904),  SNPs  located  in  repeat  region  (10,067),  and  also 
SNPs  with  extreme  GC  contents.  We  developed  bio-
informatic  parametric  optimization  and  heuristic  methods 
for  selecting  SNPs  from  these  SNPs  (Kim  et al.  2003). 
We  placed  a  higher  score  on  those  SNPs  from  the 
Japanese  SNP  database,  SNPs  with 
in-
formation,  SNPs  with  validation  scores,  and  SNPs  with 
functionally  important  positions  such  as  non-synonymous 
SNPs, in decreasing order. By using the in silico selection 
protocols,  we  selected  approximately  20,000  SNPs  to 
have  an  approximately  1.5  kb  spacing.  Four  Genotyping 
Centers  selected  further  approximately  12,000  SNPs  of 
these  SNPs  to  conduct  a  series  with  their  own  platform

genotyping  experiments.  Approximately  50%  of  genotyp-
ing  reactions  failed  because  of  either  PCR  or  extension 
reaction  failure,  and  approximately  400  SNPs  were  dis-
carded  because 
their  physical  position  had  been 
changed  since  Build  116.  Of  12,000  genotyped  SNPs, 
4681  SNPs  met  the  series  of  stringent  quality  control 
procedures  (The  International  HapMap  Consortium  2003) 
and  were  used  for  the  construction  of  LD  maps.  The 
complete  list  of  4681  SNPs,  their  reference  sequence 
numbers  (rs  number),  positional  information,  minor  allele 
frequencies  in  90  individuals,  and  other  information  are 
freely  available  at  http://www.khapmap.org.
    The  4681  SNP  markers  were  evenly  spaced  along 
chromosome  22  (average  space,  7.3  kb;  median  space, 
3.8  kb)  except  for  several  long  gaps  (Fig.  1).  As  shown 
in  Fig.  1B,  the  experimented  SNPs  had  a  randomly  dis-
tributed  minor  allele  frequency.  The  distribution  of  minor 
allele  frequencies  of  4681  SNPs  was  relatively  even,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  1D  and  were  similar  across  five  pop-
ulation  samples  (data  not  shown).  Of  4681  SNPs,  514 
SNPs  were  monomorphic  in  Korean  samples.  The  CHB 
+  JPT  had  more  than  72%  overlap  with  the  mono-
morphic  SNPs  in  Koreans,  while  CEU  and  YRI  had  less 
than  38%  overlap  (Table  1).  Of  those  SNPs  that  were 
polymorphic  in  the  HapMap  samples  but  monomorphic 
in  Koreans,  more  than  33%  of  polymorphic  markers 
showed  a  minor  allele  frequency  less  than  0.1:  CEU 
(45.1%),  JPT  (48.7%),  CHB  (59.3%),  and  YRI  (33.7%).

some.  Of  the  various  ways  to  define  haplotype  blocks, 
we  utilized  a  stringent  block  definition  by  Gabriel et al. 
(2002).
    An  estimated  number  of  hot  spots  (recombination  rate 
＞10),  the  number  of  LD  blocks,  the  total  LD  length,  the 
number  of  tagSNPs,  and  the  number  of  haplotypes  in 
five  population  samples  are  summarized  in  Table  2. 
When  the  two  measures  of  LD  (D'  and  r2)  were  inves-
tigated  between  all  pair-wise  combinations  of  markers, 
the  patterns  of  LD  across  five  population  samples  were 
similarly  complex  (Fig.  2,  only  the  Korean  data  shown). 
The  patterns  of  hot  spots  and  LD  blocks  were  dispersed 
throughout  chromosome  22,  with  some  common  blocks 
among  population  samples,  especially  highly  concordant 
between  Koreans,  Japanese,  and  Chinese.  The  largest 
block  size  in  the  Korean  sample  was  273  kb,  with  an 
average  block  size  of  20.3  kb  and  a  median  block  size 
of  9.7  kb.  The  position  of  hot  spots  was  relatively  well 
conserved  across  all  5  population  samples,  considering 
the  LD  block  patterns  that  were  estimated  by  the 
Haploview  program  (Table  2).  Total  length  of  LD  blocks, 
number  of  tagSNPs,  and  haplotypes  were  quite  similar 
between  Koreans  and  other  populations,  except  that  the 
YRI  sample  that  showed  much  lower  values.  It  seemed 
that  African  LD  blocks  were  so  scattered  that  they  built

fewer  blocks,  and  thereby  had  less  total  LD  block 
lengths  than  other  populations.  The  presence  of  rela-
tively  well  conserved  hot  spots  across  all  five  population 
samples  indicates  that  recombination  events  may  not  be 
random  along  chromosome  22. 

Analyses  of  human  population  evolution 

To  investigate  the  patterns  of  population  allele  evolution 
from  the  chimpanzee  reference  sequence,  Korean  geno-
type  data  were  compared  to  calculate  the  derived  allele 
frequency  (DAF).  Of  major  Korean  alleles,  61.4%  were 
identical  to  chimpanzee  reference  alleles,  while  37.5% 
were  flipped  into  minor  alleles,  and  1.2%  did  not  match 
the  chimpanzee  reference;  therefore,  the  allele  with  the 
lower  MAF  showed  higher  similarity  in  allele  frequency 
(Table  3). 
    The  results  of  Korean,  CEU,  and  YRI  DAF  on  chromo-
some  22  are  plotted  in  Fig.  2,  and  the  correlation  of  de-
rived  alleles  between  Koreans  and  the  four  populations 
are  depicted  in  Fig.  3.  The  correlation  of  derived  alleles 
between  other  populations  is  presented  in  Fig.  4.  A 
strong  correlation  between  the  Asian  samples  was 
clearly  seen  (Pearson's  correlation  coefficient  ＞0.80), 
while  the  weakest  correlation  (Pearson's  correlation  co-
efficient  ＜0.5)  was  between  Koreans  and  YRI,  as 
shown  in  Table  4.

Variation  among  populations

In  Fig.  2,  the  measurement  of  Fst  level  (Weir  1996)  pro-
vides  information  on  the  difference  between  Koreans 
against  four  populations  by  each  different  comparison. 
The  results  indicate  that  the  comparisons  between  Asian 
samples  are  more  similar  to  each  other  than  between 
those  of  non-Asian  groups.  The  average  Fst  levels  be-
tween  Asians  were  less  than  0.01,  whereas  the  average 
Fst  values  between  YRI  and  other  population  samples 
were  always  greater  than  0.1  (Table  4).

The  distance  between  Asian  and  African  clusters  is  lon-
ger  than  the  distance  between  European  and  Asian 
clusters.  Relative  distance  as  a  quantitative  measure, 
considering  Europeans  as  1,  indicated  that  all  three 
Asian  populations  were  very  proximate,  while  Europeans 
and  Africans  were  significantly  remote  from  Asian  pop-
ulations  (Table  5).
    If  one  population  has  an  opposite  minor  allele  com-
pared  with  the  European  minor  allele  at  a  locus,  the  al-
lele  is  designated  as  flipped.  Table  6  summarizes  the 
number  of  SNPs  that  were  flipped  on  chromosome  22. 
Considering  CEU  as  the  reference,  JPT  had  the  least 
SNPs  flipped  (23.3%),  while  YRI  had  the  most  (31.1%). 

Discussion

Recent  progress  in  the  human  genome  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  map  will  facilitate  identification  and 
characterization  of  genetic  variants  that  contribute  to 
human  phenotypes  in  general  and  human  diseases,  in 
particular  (Dawson  et al.  2002).  Genome-wide  maps  of 
common  haplotype  blocks  enable  us  to  maximize  in-
formation  content  and  to  minimize  the  number  of  SNPs 

    The  allele  frequency  difference  (AFD)  among  the  five 
population  samples  was  analyzed  by  taking  the  absolute 
difference  of  allele  frequency  at  a  locus  using  an 
European  minor  allele  as  the  reference  (Fig.  2).  The 
comparison  of  Koreans  to  other  Asian  samples  indicates 
shorter  peaks  than  non-Asian  populations,  by  AFD 
measurement. 
    These  AFDs  were  well  correlated  with  Pearson's  prod-
uct-moment  correlation  (Table  4).  Again,  the  correlation 
between  Asians  was  greater  than  0.93,  whereas  the  cor-
relation  between  Africans  and  other  populations  was  al-
ways  less  than  0.35.
    All  three  parameters--  Pearson's  product-moment 
correlation  of  DAF, 
the 
European  minor  allele  as  the  reference,  and  the  average 
Fst  between  all  four  populations--  generated  the  same 
qualitative  neighbor-joining  tree  as  shown  in  Fig.  5A 
(only  the  tree  of  DAF  is  shown).  The  smaller  Fst  values 
and  the  higher  the  correlation  of  DAF  and  AFD  mean 
that  populations  are  more  closely  connected.  The  dis-
tance-mediated  neighbor-joining 
that 
Asians  make  a  very  tight  cluster  in  which  the  distance 
between  Koreans  and  Japanese  is  the  shortest  (Fig.  5B).

However,  it  is  not  clear  whether  its  applicability  will  ex-
tend  beyond  the  populations  chosen  and  be  limited  to 
the  few  samples  studied  (Lai  et al.  2002). 
    We  have  studied  the  LD  and  haplotype  architecture  of 
chromosome  22  using  90  unrelated  healthy  Koreans  as 
a  part  of  the  Korean  HapMap  Project.  Chromosome  22 
was  chosen  due  to  its  relatively  small  size.  When  this 
work  was  carried  out  in  2003,  the  number  of  validated 

SNPs  in  dbSNP  was  much  less  compared  with  the  fol-
lowing  years,  which  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  we  failed 
in  PCR  and  extension  reactions  of  the  SNP  genotyping 
experiments. 
    Comparing  3430  common  SNPs  among  five  pop-
ulations,  514  SNPs  were  monomorphic  in  Koreans.  Of 
those,  more  than  72%  was  found  to  be  shared  in  Asian 
populations,  while  Europeans  and  Africans  had  less  than 
a  38%  overlap,  reflecting  strong  genetic  affinities  among

the  three  Asian  populations.  Many  comparative  studies 
of  LD  patterns  at  various  levels  showed  a  high  degree 
of  concordance  among  various  populations  (Gabriel  et 
al.  2002;  Stenzel et al.  2004;  De  La  Vega et al.  2005). 
The  patterns  of  hot  spots  and  LD  blocks  in  this  study 
also  showed  dispersed  common  blocks  throughout 
chromosome  22,  especially  highly  overlapped  among 
Asian  populations.  The  numbers  of  hot  spots  seem 
more  conservative  than  the  number  of  LD  blocks  (Table 
2).  Because  recombination  hotspots  are  ubiquitous  fea-
tures  of  the  human  genome  and  create  clear  block 
structures  of  different  populations,  they  delimit  strong 
cold  spots  of  LD  blocks  (McVean  et al.  2004). 
    One  approach  to  understand  what  makes  humans 
unique  as  a  species  is  to  perform  structural  and  func-
tional  comparisons  between  the  genomes  of  humans 
and  our  closest  evolutionary  relatives,  the  great  apes 
(Thomson  et al.  2000).  Recently,  since  the  draft  se-
quence  of  the  chimpanzee  genome  has  been  available, 
derived  allele  frequency  (DAF)  can  be  determined  by 
comparing  human  alleles  with  chimpanzee,  wherein  DAF 
reflects  the  evolutionary  direction  of  an  allele  toward

human.  A  strong  correlation  between  Asians  was  clearly 
seen,  while  Europeans  and  Africans  showed  very  weak 
correlation  (Fig.  3). 
    Furthermore,  analysis  of  the  distribution  of  Fst  levels 
and  allele  frequency  difference  (AFD)  between  Koreans 
and  the  four  other  populations  confirmed  a  strong  corre-
lation  between  Asians,  while  Europeans  and  Africans 
showed  very  weak  correlation  with  Koreans.  The  dis-
tance-mediated  neighbor-joining  tree  that  considered 
these  three  factors  showed  that  Asians  and  Africans  are 
more  remotely  connected  and  that  Europeans  are  closer 
to  the  Asian  populations  (Fig.  5B).  Among  Asian  clus-
ters,  Koreans  and  Japanese  are  the  closest.  These  re-
sults  reflect  the  "Out  of  Africa"  theory,  which  claims  that 
our  roots  are 
in  Africa,  and  most  of  the  oldest 
non-African  lineages  are  Asian  (Thomson  et al.  2000). 
The  short  relational  distance  of  Asians  is  partly  respon-
sible  for  geographical  adjacency,  historical  factors,  and 
migration  of  people.

    In  summary,  the  Korean  LD  map  of  chromosome  22 
was  constructed  and  compared  with  other  populations. 
Our  observation  from  allelic  characteristics  of  Koreans, 
including  genetic  variations,  indicated  that  all  three 
Asian  populations  are  very  proximate,  while  Europeans 
and  Africans  are  significantly 
from  Asian 
populations.  The  fact  that  the  Asian  cluster  is  tightly  re-
lated  is  implied  from  the  genome-wide  allelic  compari-
son.  However,  because  chromosome  region-specific  dif-
ferences  in  LD  patterns  could  have  occurred,  associa-
tion  studies  in  a  given  population  will  require  further 
genotyping  experiments  and  analyses  across  the  whole 
human  genome.
