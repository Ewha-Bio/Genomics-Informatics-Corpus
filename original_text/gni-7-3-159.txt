Abstract

Human  personal  genome  sequencing  can  be  done  with 
high  efficiency  by  aligning  a  huge  number  of  short  reads 
derived  from  various  next  generation  sequencing  (NGS) 
technologies  to  the  reference  genome  sequence.  One  of 
the  major  obstacles  is  the  incompleteness  of  human  ref-
erence  genome.  We  tried  to  analyze  the  effect  of  hidden 
gene  duplication  on  the  NGS  data  using  the  known  ex-
ample  of hydin  gene. Hydin2,  a  duplicated  copy  of hy-
din  on  chromosome  16q22,  has  been  recently  found  to 
be  localized  to  chromosome  1q21,  and  is  not  included 
in  the  current  version  of  standard  human  genome 
reference.  We  found  that  all  of  eight  personal  genome 
data  published  so  far  do  not  contain hydin2,  and  there 
is  large  number  of  nsSNPs  in hydin.  The  heterozygosity 
of  those  nsSNPs  was  significantly  higher  than  expected. 
The  sequence  coverage  depth  in hydin  gene  was  about 
two  fold  of  average  depth.  We  believe  that  these  unique 
finding  of hydin  can  be  used  as  useful  indicators  to  dis-
cover  new  hidden  multiplication  in  human  genome.

Next  generation  sequencing  (NGS)  technology  has  made 
personal  genome  sequencing  possible  in  the  laboratory 
scale  by  decreasing  the  cost  and  time  for  genome  se-
quencing  (Tucker  et al.,  2009;  Yngvadottir,  2009).  We 
have  recently  finished  the  whole  genome  sequencing  of 
a  Korean  male  (AK1)  (Kim et al.,  2009)  and  a  Korean  fe-
male  (AK2)  (unpublished).  At  least  five  more  personal

from 

genomes  have  also  been  reported  to  be  sequenced  by 
NGS  technology  (Ahn et al.,  2009;  Bentley et al.,  2008; 
McKernan  et al.,  2009;  Wang  et al.,  2008;  Wheeler  et 
al.,  2008)  One  of  the  major  drawbacks  in  NGS  technol-
ogy  is  relative  short  read  length  compared  to  the  con-
ventional  capillary  sequencing.  For  this  reason,  the  read 
sequences  have  to  be  aligned  to  one  reference  se-
quence  rather  than  being  assembled  with  each  others. 
The  most  frequently  used  reference  is  the  human  refer-
ence  genome  sequence  derived 
the  Human 
Genome  Project  (IHGSC,  2004).  Although  this  reference 
sequence  have  been  constantly  updated  and  used  by 
number  of  researchers  world-wide  ,  these  sequences 
still  have  large  number  of  gaps,  and  are  far  from  being 
completed.  Therefore,  if  a  part  of  the  sample  genome  is 
largely  different  from  the  reference  or  if  counterpart  is 
missing  in  the  reference  genome,  analysis  of  this  part 
by  NGS  may  be  impossible  or  likely  to  be  erroneous.  In 
this  paper,  we  tried  to  study  the  effect  of  hidden  dupli-
cation  of  human hydin  in  the  reference  genome  on  NGS 
data.
    Mouse hydin  was  first  identified  as  a  candidate  gene 
in  the  Hy3  mouse  model  of  hydrocephalus  (Davy  and 
Robinson,  2003).  Doggett et al.  found  that  human hydin 
gene,  the  ortholog  of  murine hydin,  had  been  duplicated 
from  chromosome  16q22.2  into  chromsosome  1q21.1 
(Doggett et al.,  2006).  In  addition  to  its  localization,  the 
sequences,  exon/intron  structure  and  expression  pattern 
based  on  the  EST  profile  of hydin2  have  been  identified 
and  are  available  in  public  database  (http://www.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov).  However,  the  exact  location  of  hydin2  in-
sertion  in  chromosome  1  is  still  uncertain.  Therefore, 
build  37,  the  current  version  of  human  reference  ge-
nome  does  not  contain hydin2  in  the  sequence  of  chro-
mosome  1.
    During  the  analysis  of  non-synonymous  single  nucleo-
tide  polymorphisms  (nsSNPs)  in  AK1  and  AK2,  we  found 
that  hydin  is  one  of  the  so-called  super-SNP  genes, 
which  have  much  higher  number  of  nsSNPs  than  other 
genes.  When  we  compared  the  number  of  nsSNPs  in 
hydin  of  other  personal  genome  sequences,  all  had  sim-
ilarly  large  number  of  nsSNPS  (Table  1).  The  average 
nsSNP  density  of  hydin  in  eight  genomes  (1.66±0.34 
per  kb  coding  sequence)  were  significantly  higher  than 
the average genome-wide nsSNP density (0.27±0.02, p＜ 
−5).  This  finding  is  less  likely  to  be  originated  from 
10
technical  problem  in  sequencing  or  analysis  procedures, 
considering  that  all  different  genome  data  showed  sim-

*Number  of  nsSNPs  per  1  kb  cds  (coding  sequence)  of  hydin.
†This  paper  used  two  different  methods  for  aligning.  We  used  the  result  made  by  MAQ.
‡Total  number  of  nsSNP  sites  was  calculated  by  counting  the  nsSNPs  occurring  at  the  same  position  in  different  data  as 
one  site.

confirm  this  hypothesis,  we  examined  coverage  depth 
profile  of hydin  in  AK1  genome.  As  clearly  seen  in  Fig. 
1,  the  average  coverage  depth  of hydin  gene  is  roughly 
60x,  being  double  of  30x  in  other  regions.
    Finally  we  compared  each  variant  sequences  de-
termined  as  nsSNPs  in hydin  with  the  known  sequence 
of hydin2.  The  variant  alleles  of  all  35  nsSNPs  found  in 
hydin  of  AK1  with  the  exception  of  only  one,  were  found 
to  be  same  to  the  wild  type  alleles  at  the  counterpart 
position  of  hydin2  (data  not  shown).  Because  we  can 
not  determine  whether  it  comes  from  hydin  or  hydin2 
when  a  sequence  read  is  aligned  to hydin  in  reference 
genome,  these  data  do  not  guarantee  that  the  difference 
between  hydin  and  hydin2  could  be  the  only  origin  of 
the  enrichment  of  nsSNP  genes.  Further  sequencing 
analysis  using  clone  of  cDNA  and/or  genomic  DNA  from 
AK1  will  be  required  for  complete  understanding  of 
more  detailed  structure  of  both  hydin  and  hydin2.  We 
believe  that  at  least  some  part  of  the  other  super-SNP 
genes  found  in  AK1  or  other  genomes  are  originated  by 
the  hidden  duplication  like hydin.  Our  result  suggest  that 
the  criteria  we  found  in hydin:  1)  enrichment  of  nsSNPs, 
2)  increased  ratio  of  heterozygous  to  homozygous 
SNPs,  and  3)  increase  in  coverage  depth,  can  be  used 
as  useful  indicators  to  discover  the  hidden  structural 
variation  in  human  genomes.

ilar  increase  in  the  number  of  nsSNPs. 
    Another  clue  explaining  this  finding  was  the  ratio  of 
heterozygous  and  homozygous  nsSNPs  in  hydin  (Table 
1).  Heterozygous  and  homozygous  SNPs  were  62.5% 
and  37.5%  of  total  SNPs  in  AK1.  This  pattern  was  sim-
ilar  in  nsSNPs,  61.7%  and  38.3%  of  total  nsSNPs  being 
heterozygous  and  homozygous  nsSNPs,  respectively.  In 
hydin  of  AK1,  however,  only  one  of  35  nsSNP  was 
homozygous.  Other  seven  genome  data  showed  almost 
same  ratio  of  homozygous  and  heterozygous  nsSNPs.
    All  these  finding  might  be  explained  by  the  gene 
duplication.  Because  there  is  no hydin2  in  the  reference 
genome,  all  the  sequence  reads  derived  from hydin2  as 
well  as hydin  had  to  be  aligned  to  only hydin  of  the  ref-
erence  genome.  This  will  make  the  alignment  result  as 
if  hydin  of  these  samples  were  tetraploidy,  that  is  four 
copies,  being  double  of  other  areas  in  autosome.  To
