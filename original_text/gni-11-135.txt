Gene set analysis is a powerful tool for interpreting a genome-wide association study result and is gaining popularity these 
days. Comparison of the gene sets obtained for a variety of traits measured from a single genetic epidemiology dataset may 
give insights into the biological mechanisms underlying these traits. Based on the previously published single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) genotype data on 8,842 individuals enrolled in the Korea Association Resource project, we performed 
a series of systematic genome-wide association analyses for 49 quantitative traits of basic epidemiological, anthropometric, 
or blood chemistry parameters. Each analysis result was subjected to subsequent gene set analyses based on Gene Ontology 
(GO) terms using gene set analysis software, GSA-SNP, identifying a set of GO terms significantly associated to each trait (pcorr 
＜ 0.05). Pairwise comparison of the traits in terms of the semantic similarity in their GO sets revealed surprising cases where 

phenotypically uncorrelated traits showed high similarity in terms of biological pathways. For example, the pH level was 
related to 7 other traits that showed low phenotypic correlations with it. A literature survey implies that these traits may be 
regulated partly by common pathways that involve neuronal or nerve systems.

Introduction

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now well 
established  for  discovering  hypothesis-free  genetic  loci 
whose  variations  are  associated  with  a  phenotype  [1-4]. 
Downstream analysis of the study result in terms of gene 
sets is gaining popularity these days, as it facilitates bio-
logical interpretation of a GWA result [5].

The  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project  has 
collected  epidemiological  and  genotype  data  from  the 
regional cohorts in Ansung and Ansan, Korea [6]. A number 
of  GWA  studies  based  on  this  KARE  data  have  been 
published  so  far  [6-8].  We  pursued  re-analyses  of  these 
studies in terms of gene sets in a systematic way to warrant 
cross-comparisons of the traits. We mimicked the analysis 
conditions of the original published GWA works as much as 
possible, based on the de facto standard program PLINK [9]. 
For the gene set analysis, we used GSA-SNP software [10], 
an efficient Java-based application that accepts a list of single 

nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and  their  association 
p-values and outputs the gene set p-values after multiple 
testing correction.

We  applied  this  procedure  to  49  baseline  quantitative 
traits that were of epidemiological, anthropometric, or blood 
chemistry  parameters.  As  expected,  those  traits  that  are 
known  to  share  common  biological  mechanisms  and  to 
overlap  in  their  population  incidences  indeed  showed  si-
milar profiles of the significantly associated gene sets. To our 
surprise, some of the traits that were phenotypically uncor-
related  in  our  study  population  and  were  seemingly  un-
related  to  each  other  showed  similar  profiles  of  the 
significantly associated gene sets. Our results may demon-
strate  a  useful  strategy  of  discovering  pleiotropy,  which 
refers to a phenomenon of common pathways involved in 
distinct phenotypes.

J  Kim,  et  al.  Gene  Set  Analyses  of  49  Quantitative  Traits
 

Methods
Phenotype and genotype data

Details of the KARE study design have been reported [6]. 
Briefly, the genotype data were measured for a total of 10,038 
residents in both Ansung and Ansan provinces, Korea, using 
Affymetrix  Genome-wide  Human  SNP  Array  5.0  chips 
(Affymetrix  Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  After  quality 
control, 352k SNP genotypes for 8,842 samples were used in 
the  subsequent  GWA  analyses.  The  epidemiological  trait 
data for these individuals were also received from the KARE 
project. Among a total of 49 quantitative traits, we took a 
logarithm of 5 trait values to balance the distribution.

GWA analyses

We used the imputed genotype data that comprised 1.8 
million SNP markers [6]. GWA analyses of these 49 quan-
titative traits were performed by linear regression under the 
additive genetic model, as implemented in PLINK.

Gene set analyses
We performed GSA using the Gene Ontology (GO) data-
bases, where only gene sets having 10‒200 members (2,476 
biological  process  GO  terms)  were  used.  We  applied  the 
Z-statistic method, as implemented in GSA-SNP [10], with 
the default options. Briefly, those SNPs residing inside or 
within 20 kb of the boundary of each gene were compiled, 
and the second best p-value was assigned to the gene. See 
Kwon et al. [11] for the rationale of using the second best 
p-value  instead  of  the  best  p-value.  The  gene  score  was 
defined as the －log of the p-value assigned to the gene. The 
Z-statistic was then calculated for each gene set [10]. The 
p-values  for  each  gene  set  were  computed  under  the 
assumption  of  a  normal  distribution  of  the  Z-statistic, 
followed  by  multiple  testing  correction  using  the  false 
discovery rate method. When the member genes of a gene 
set  overlapped  in  their  genomic  loci  or  were  located  in 
tandem  within  a  short  block  of  strong  linkage  disequili-
brium, the p-values assigned to them might have been highly 
correlated. In such cases, only one of them was included to 
calculate the gene set score.

Semantic similarity between GO terms

The  R  package  GOSemSim  was  developed  to  compute 
semantic similarity among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene 
products, and gene clusters. This package contains functions 
to estimate the semantic similarity of GO terms based on 
Resnik's,  Lin's,  Jiang  and  Conrath's,  Rel’s,  and  Wang’s 
methods. Here, we used Wang’s method for our analysis. 
This method determines the semantic similarity of two GO 
terms based on both the locations of these terms in the GO 

graph and their relationships with their ancestor terms [12]. 
The similarity index between the two GO terms was between 
0 (the least similar) and 1 (identical). The similarity between 
two sets of GO terms was calculated as follows. First, the 
highest  value  against  all  members  of  the  other  set  was 
calculated for a given GO term in one of the sets. Then, all of 
these  values  were  collected  and  averaged  to  provide  the 
similarity  between  the  two  sets.  The  significance  of  the 
similarity index was inferred, based on the distribution of 
the indices from 106 random samplings.

Results and Discussion

Parallel and systematic GWA studies of a number of traits 
using a single genetic epidemiology dataset give a unique 
opportunity to explore common biological pathways regu-
lating  multiple  traits  that  do  not  display  phenotypic  cor-
relations.  In  this  report,  we  focused  on  the  49  baseline 
quantitative  trait  data  that  were  demographic,  anthro-
pometric, or blood chemistry parameters. 

We  surveyed  the  literature  for  the  published  GWA 
studies, based on the KARE data, and extracted the infor-
mation  on  the  analysis  conditions,  such  as  exclusion  of 
samples  and  covariates  of  association  regression.  For  the 
GWA analyses of all 49 traits, we included area, age, and sex 
as covariates, and for some of the traits, additional covariates 
were added, based on the literature information (Table 1). 
The phenotypic relations were also learned from principal 
component  analysis  (PCA).  For  example,  the  directions 
pointed by waist and body mass index (BMI) were similar in 
the PCA plot (Fig. 1); using BMI as one of the covariates for 
the analysis of waist. On the contrary, we used a literature 
guide for the analysis of BMI [13]. GWA analyses for all 49 
traits  were  performed  using  linear  regression,  as  imple-
mented in PLINK, and the resulting SNP p-values were fed 
into GSA-SNP for gene set analysis.

For each of the 49 traits, we identified biological process 
GO  terms  that  showed  p  ＜ 0.05  after  multiple  testing 
correction  (the  lists  are  available  upon  request).  As  GO 
terms are hierarchically arranged, verbatim matches are not 
desirable for the comparison of a pair of gene sets. Instead, 
one should take into consideration the number of nodes in 
the GO tree that separate a pair of terms. For this, we used 
so-called  semantic  similarity,  as  implemented  in  the  R 
package GOSemSim. For each pair of traits, we calculated the 
semantic similarity of the gene sets and plotted it against the 
correlation coefficient between the trait values (Fig. 2). The 
pairs  showing  semantic  similarity  greater  than  0.8  corre-
sponded  to  traits  that  had  high  correlations  in  the  trait 
values.  We  also  noted  many  pairs  having  high  semantic 
similarity, despite low phenotypic correlation.

We selected 46 trait pairs that showed a semantic simi-
larity in gene sets greater than an arbitrary cutoff of 0.75 and 
depicted the interaction network using Cytoscape (Fig. 3). 
The traits related to blood lipid levels, such as total cho-
lesterol,  high  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol,  low  density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (TGs), formed a 
small network by themselves. As cholesterol and TGs are 
components of lipoproteins, it is not surprising to observe 
such a network. Both hip and waist-hip ratio are connected 
to suprailiac skinfold; they are all related to body fat. The 

most striking feature is a large network involving 20 traits. In 
this network, the traits related to blood glucose levels, such 
as  GLU0,  GLU60,  GLU120,  HbA1c,  and  HOMA,  form  a 
subnetwork. In addition, the traits related to either blood 
pressure  or  liver  damage  also  formed  respective  sub-
networks,  as  expected  from  their  high  phenotypic  cor-
relations.

We also noted some hub nodes having many first 
neighbors. Interestingly, the pH level was connected to 7 
other traits, none of which showed high phenotypic

correlations with it. We examined the gene sets that were 
commonly  shared between  these  traits  (Table 2).  Among 
them, 11 were related to neuron development and function. 
We  surveyed  the  literature  for  putative  involvement  of 
neuronal or nerve systems in the regulation of those 8 traits 
(Table 3). Although it is presumptive, this may imply that 
these traits are regulated partly by common pathways that 
involve the neuronal system.

In  conclusion,  our  work  may  be  a  useful  approach  for 

discovering pleiotropy.
