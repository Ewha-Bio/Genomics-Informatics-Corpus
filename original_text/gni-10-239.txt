Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a complex metabolic disorder of pregnancy that is suspected to have a strong genetic 
predisposition. It is associated with poor perinatal outcome, and both GDM women and their offspring are at increased risk 
of future development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). During the past several years, there has been progress in finding 
the genetic risk factors of GDM in relation to T2DM. Some of the genetic variants that were proven to be significantly 
associated  with  T2DM  are  also  genetic  risk  factors  of  GDM.  Recently,  a  genome-wide  association  study  of  GDM  was 
performed  and  reported  that  genetic  variants  in  CDKAL1  and  MTNR1B  were  associated  with  GDM  at  a  genome-wide 
significance level. Current investigations using next-generation sequencing will improve our insight into the pathophysiology 
of  GDM.  It  would  be  important  to  know  whether  genetic  information  revealed  from  these  studies  could  improve  our 
prediction of GDM and the future development of T2DM. We hope further research on the genetics of GDM would ultimately 
lead us to personalized genomic medicine and improved patient care.

Introduction

Gestational  diabetes  mellitus  (GDM)  is  defined  as  ab-
normal glucose tolerance that is first identified or diagnosed 
during pregnancy [1]. It is estimated that approximately 2% 
to 5% of all pregnancies in Korean women are complicated by 
GDM  [2].  The  clinical  significance  of  GDM  is  that  it 
increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes [3]. In a 
recent large-scale multinational prospective study, increased 
maternal glucose concentration during pregnancy was sig-
nificantly associated with increased neonatal birth weight, 
primary  cesarean  delivery,  neonatal  hypoglycemia,  and 
increased placental C-peptide levels [4]. After parturition, 
about 15% of GDM women had persistent diabetes at an 
early  postpartum  period  of  2  months  [5].  GDM  is  also 
reported  to  recur  at  a  frequency  of  45%  in  subsequent 
pregnancies [6]. Women with a previous history of GDM are 
at increased risk of future development of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM). The risk of T2DM is 3.5 times greater in 

women  with  a  history  of  GDM  compared  to  the  general 
population in Koreans [7]. In addition, offspring of GDM 
women are also at risk of developing obesity and T2DM [8]. 
The incidence of GDM is expected to rise, as it will parallel 
the increasing rate of obesity and T2DM. Furthermore, the 
recent recommendation from the International Association 
of  Diabetes  and  Pregnancy  Study  Group  has  lowered  the 
diagnostic threshold of GDM and is expected to increase the 
incidence of GDM [9]. 

Heritability of GDM

GDM is thought to have strong heritability. GDM women 
have an increased positive family history of T2DM. Com-
pared to pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance, 
GDM women have a significantly greater parental history of 
T2DM (13.2% vs. 30.1%, p ＜ 0.001) [10]. In addition, both 
GDM  women  and  their  offspring  are  at  increased  risk  of 
future development of T2DM. The heritability estimate of

T2DM was reported to be quite high (h2 = 0.69) in a recent 
study  performed  in  Europeans  [11].  These  findings  are 
indirect evidence that GDM has familial tendency. However, 
there is no study that has specifically evaluated the herit-
ability of GDM using familial clustering or twins [12]. It 
would be important to estimate the heritability of GDM and 
compare it with that of T2DM in women.

Pathophysiological Similarities of GDM and 
T2DM

During normal pregnancy, women experience increased 
adiposity and weight gain, which begin near mid-pregnancy 
and progress throughout the third trimester [13]. In this 
period, insulin resistance ensues as a consequence of multi-
ple  factors,  including  increased  production  of  placental 
growth hormone, estrogen, and tumor necrosis factor α [14, 
15].  Pregnant  women  with  normal  glucose  tolerance  can 
increase  their  β-cell  insulin  secretion  in  response  to  this 
increased insulin resistance during pregnancy. Although the 
mechanism of increased β-cell insulin secretion during pre-
gnancy is not fully understood, it is reported that prolactin, 
which increases during pregnancy, can repress islet menin 
levels  and  stimulate  β-cell  proliferation  in  mice  [16].  In 
addition, recent reports suggest that β-cell serotonin signa-
ling  is  also  a  major  determinant  of  β-cell  mass  during 

pregnancy [17]. It has been suggested from several clinical 
studies  that  GDM  women  have  limited  insulin  secretion 
capacity that cannot compensate for the increased insulin 
resistance [13]. Similar to GDM, T2DM is also characterized 
by  relative  deficiency  in  insulin  secretion  in  the  face  of 
increased  insulin  resistance.  Various  factors,  including 
increased age, obesity, high-fat diet, and sedentary lifestyle, 
can induce insulin resistance, and those who do not have 
sufficient β-cell insulin secretory capacity are more likely to 
develop T2DM [13]. Therefore, it is said that a large pro-
portion of GDM women are experiencing future T2DM in 
advance. 

Association of T2DM Genetic Variants in GDM

Based on the findings that GDM women are at high risk of 
T2DM  and  both  GDM  and  T2DM  share  similar  patho-
physiologies, it is reasonable to assume that they might also 
share  similar  genetic  risk  factors.  Soon  after  the  initial 
reports of T2DM genome-wide association (GWA) studies 
[18-21], several studies investigated whether genetic vari-
ants that were identified through GWA studies of T2DM 
were also associated with the risk of GDM [22, 23]. Cho et al. 
[22] genotyped variants in or near CDKAL1, CDKN2A/2B, 
FTO,  HHEX,  IGF2BP2,  SLC30A8,  TCF7L2,  KCNJ11,  and 
PPARG in 869 GDM women and 632 carefully selected non-

=  761,  men：women  =  354：407), 
and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
group (n = 869) in Koreans. There is 
an  increasing  trend  of  risk  allele  fre-
quencies from controls to T2DM and
from  T2DM to GDM.  The odds ratio

diabetic control subjects. They found that genetic variants in 
CDKAL1 and CDKN2A/2B were highly associated with the 
risk of GDM (p ＜ 1 × 10－6). In addition, variants in HHEX, 
IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2 were all nominally asso-
ciated with GDM (p ＜ 0.05). Among a total of 18 genetic 
variants studied, 9 reached a nominal significance level (p ＜ 
0.05). In Fig. 1, the risk allele frequency as well as the odds 
ratios  of  known  T2DM  variants  are  compared  among  a 
control group (n = 632, men：women = 287：345), T2DM 
group  (n  =  761,  men：women  =  354：407),  and  GDM 
group  (n  =  869)  in  Koreans  [22,  24].  For  most  of  the 
variants,  there  was  an  increasing  trend  of  risk  allele 
frequencies from control to T2DM and from T2DM to GDM. 
Lauenborg et al. [23] also found that variants in TCF7L2, 
CDKAL1, and TCF2 were significantly associated with the 
risk of GDM in Europeans, consisting of 283 GDM women 
and  2,446  glucose-tolerant  control  women.  Variants  in 
KCNQ1, which were first identified in an East Asian T2DM 
GWA study, were also significantly associated with the risk 
of  GDM  in  Koreans  (p  ＜ 0.05)  [25].  Recently,  it  was 
reported  that  TPH1  and  HTR2B  play  a  crucial  role  in 
regulating  pancreatic  β-cell  mass  during  pregnancy  in  a 
mouse model and that their genetic alterations could result 
in GDM [17]. A total 6 genetic variants in HTR2B and 11 
variants in TPH1 were identified and genotyped in Korean 
GDM  women  and  control  subjects  [26].  Although  there 
were no significant associations of these variants with the 
risk of GDM, they were associated with measures of obesity 
and weight gain during pregnancy [26]. 

GWA Study of GDM

Following these candidate approach studies was a two- 
staged  GWA  study  that  was  performed  in  Korean  GDM 
women [27]. A total of 468 GDM women and 1,242 non-
diabetic control women were genotyped using Affymetrix 
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0. Variants that passed 
the prespecified p-value threshold in the stage 1 genome 
scan were further genotyped in 931 GDM women and 783 
nondiabetic control women. Two variants, one located in an 
intron  of  CDKAL1  (rs7754840)  and  one  near  MTNR1B 
(rs10830962),  were  associated  with  a  risk  of  GDM  at  a 
genome-wide significance level (p = 6.65 × 10－16 and p = 
2.49 × 10－13, respectively). This was the first GWA study 
investigating  the  genetic  risk  factors  of  GDM.  Although 
variants  in  MTNR1B  have  been  previously  reported  to  be 
associated with increased fasting glucose levels, the study 
was the first to report that MTNR1B variants are associated 
with GDM at a genome-wide significance level. One of the 
limitations was that it was not sufficiently powered to find 
truly novel genetic variants that were only specific in GDM. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  4,  2012

It should be noted that current GWA and GWA meta-analysis 
performed in T2DM recruits more than 100,000 cases and 
controls  [28].  One  of  the  interesting  findings  was  that 
genetic variants of T2DM were enriched in GDM subjects. 
Among  the  34  confirmed T2DM  genetic  variants,  8  were 
associated with a risk of GDM [27]. In addition, when the 
β-coefficients (or odds ratio) of the variants derived from the 
logistic  regression  were  compared  between  GDM  and 
T2DM, there was a significant positive correlation of β-co-
efficients between the two [27]. These findings suggest that 
GDM and T2DM might share similar genetic backgrounds, 
at least in part.

Perspectives in Genetic Studies of GDM

GWA studies have opened a new era in diabetes research. 
Our knowledge on the genetic predisposition of GDM as well 
as T2DM is expected to increase even faster as next-gene-
ration sequencing technology is applied to this field. There 
should  be  even  larger  GWA  studies  on  GDM,  and  GWA 
meta-analyses should be available. In this way, we could find 
variants that have smaller effect sizes but are more specific to 
GDM  than  T2DM.  In  order  to  understand  the  genetic 
determinants of glucose and insulin concentration during 
pregnancy, genetic associations regarding these quantitative 
traits should be investigated. A fast way is to see whether 
genetic variants that are known to affect glucose or insulin 
concentration in the normal population also affect glucose or 
insulin concentration during pregnancy [29]. In addition, a 
GWA  study  on  glucose  or  insulin  concentration  during 
pregnancy should also be helpful. In this way, we would be 
able to better understand the pathophysiology of GDM. 

By definition, GDM encompasses women with pre-exiting 
T2DM, maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), or 
even  type  1  diabetes  patients  that  were  not  diagnosed 
previously. It would be important to know the proportion of 
MODY patients that constitute GDM. In particular, about 
15% of GDM patients remain diabetic at early postpartum 
periods, and a significant portion of these subjects might fall 
into  the  category  of  MODY.  The  contribution  of  genetic 
variants known to cause MODY, such as GCK and HNF1A, in 
GDM has been reviewed in recent literature [30]. However, 
whole-exome sequencing will provide us with better bird’s 
eye view on the contribution of MODY genes in GDM. In 
addition, it might be able to find novel MODY genes in those 
who have persistent diabetes after GDM pregnancy and also 
have a strong family history of diabetes.

One  of  the  first  steps  in  translating  the  genetic  infor-
mation into clinical practice would be to predict the future 
development of T2DM in GDM women. GDM women are at 
particularly  high  risk  of  developing  T2DM  and  require

preventive measures and early screening of T2DM. Genetic 
information  might  improve  our  prediction  of  T2DM  in 
women  with  a  history  of  GDM.  This  is  an  area  of  active 
research [31, 32], and we are looking forward to studies that 
use  genotype  risk  scores  in  predicting  T2DM  in  GDM 
women. A similar approach could also be applied in pre-
dicting GDM, as more genetic variants associated with GDM 
are expected to be revealed.

The  functional  consequences  of  the  current  common 
genetic variants identified through GWA studies of GDM are 
not well understood yet. It is not known whether they are 
markers in linkage disequilibrium with nearby causal vari-
ants or whether they have unknown but relevant functional 
roles.  Next-generation  sequencing  might  give  answers  to 
these questions, but a huge number of samples and much 
effort will be required.

Concluding Remarks

GDM women are at increased risk of developing T2DM 
and have familial clustering of T2DM. A common patho-
physiology that is shared by GDM and T2DM is impaired 
compensatory increase in insulin secretion to overcome the 
increased  insulin  resistance.  The  GWA  study  of  GDM 
enabled us to investigate the common genetic risk factors of 
GDM, and it revealed that GDM and T2DM share similar 
genetic backgrounds, at least in part (Fig. 2). Although this 
information has significantly improved our insight in  the 
pathogenesis of GDM, there are more unanswered questions

T2DM  and  are  at  high  risk  of  developing  T2DM.  Using  genetic
association studies, it has been shown that GDM and T2DM share 
similar  genetic  backgrounds,  at  least  in  part.

remaining  that  should  be  explicitly  expressed.  Using  the 
technology of next-generation sequencing, it is expected that 
more causal, rare variants will be identified. This genetic 
information  would  ultimately  improve  our  prediction  of 
GDM  and  future  T2DM.  In  addition,  we  hope  that  per-
sonalized  genomic  medicine  could  be  available  using  the 
advances in the genetics of GDM and T2DM.
