It  is  becoming  increasingly  clear  that  eukaryotic  genomes  are  subjected  to  higher-order  chromatin  organization  by  the 
CCCTC-binding factor/cohesin complex. Their dynamic interactions in three dimensions within the nucleus regulate gene 
transcription by changing the chromatin architecture. Such spatial genomic organization is functionally important for the 
spatial disposition of chromosomes to control cell fate during development and differentiation. Thus, the dysregulation of 
proper long-range chromatin interactions may influence the development of tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

Keywords: cohesins, CTCF, gene expression regulation, higher-order chromatin structure, topologically associated domain

Introduction

Genomes form higher-order chromatin structures during 
cellular development and differentiation [1-4]. The spatial 
folding  of  chromosomes  and  their  organization  in  the 
nucleus have profound effects on gene expression [5, 6]. It is 
now well established that chromosomal architecture is largely 
mediated  by  the  CCCTC-binding  factor  (CTCF)/cohesin 
complex [7, 8]. CTCF, a zinc finger DNA-binding protein 
that functions in transcriptional repression, activation, and 
as  an  insulator  that  interferes  with  enhancer–promoter 
interactions [9], is needed for the recruitment of cohesin to 
chromatin [10]. In addition to its major influence on sister 
chromatid cohesion [11], cohesin affects gene transcription 
by facilitating long-range interactions between members of 
many developmentally regulated gene families [12-14].

Interphase chromosomes of higher eukaryotes are sub-
divided into evolutionarily conserved topologically associa-
ted domains (TADs) in the three-dimensional space of the 
nucleus  (Fig.  1)  [15,  16].  TADs  are  defined  as  self-asso-
ciating chromosome segments enclosed by a chromatin loop 
in the megabase range detected by Hi-C methods [17]. TADs 
show a high frequency of interactions within domains and a 
low frequency of interactions among different domains [15, 
17].  They  are  partitioned  into  several  subcompartments 

related  to  their  gene  expression  patterns  and  maintained 
across cell types, suggesting that TADs shape the regulatory 
landscape of the genome during development [6, 15, 16]. 
Interestingly, in the boundaries of TADs, there is an abun-
dance of the architectural protein CTCF and cohesin [6, 15], 
suggesting that these proteins have a role in establishing the 
topological boundaries [17].

Increasing evidence from recent studies has indicated that 
genomic  instability  is  spatially  related  to  higher-order 
chromatin organization in cancer cells [18]. Previous studies 
of c-Myc, BCL, and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (Igh) (the 
most common translocation partners in various B-cell lym-
phomas) showed that these loci are preferentially localized 
in close spatial juxtaposition to each other in normal B cells 
[19, 20]. Moreover, the boundaries of copy-number alterations 
are  preferentially  localized  in  close  spatial  juxtaposition 
within  the  nucleus  [21-23].  Thus,  the  continuous  DNA 
damage and subsequent defective repair near double-strand 
break (DSB) sites might generate copy-number alterations 
of oncogenes during tumorigenesis [24, 25]. In addition, the 
recent discovery that DSBs and subsequent amplification of 
estrogen response elements can be generated by estrogen- 
induced long-range chromatin interactions in breast cancer 
[26]  further  indicates  the  importance  of  higher-order 
genome  architecture  for  chromosomal  rearrangement. 
Therefore, the close spatial proximity of genomic regions

may provide an opportunity for the formation of specific, 
cancer-related  chromosomal  translocation  events  during 
tumor development [18, 27, 28].

Here, we briefly review recent works on the roles of CTCF 
and cohesin in genome folding, their global impact on gene 
expression, and their association with human disease.

Results
CTCF

Chromatin organizer roles of CTCF
CTCF is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that 
functions  by  utilizing  an  11-zinc-finger  domain  [29]. 
Because CTCF was first identified at the 5´ and 3´ ends of 
the chicken β-globin locus [30] and the imprinted Igf2/H19 
locus [31, 32], it is known as an insulator protein that can 
block  enhancer  activity  in  eukaryotes  [32].  Although 
insulators  would  be  expected  to  be  located  in  intergenic 
regions where they could act as barriers to block enhancer 
activity [30], genome-wide analysis indicated that CTCF- 
binding sites are present in genes and/or promoter regions 
as well as intergenic regions [10, 33]. More recent evidence 
revealed  that  almost  15%  of  CTCF-recognition  sites  are 
located  near  promoters  and  ∼40%  are  within  exons  and 
introns [17], suggesting that CTCF has dynamic roles other 
than enhancer blocking activity.

While earlier studies implied that the distribution patterns 
of CTCF are similar to those of transcription activators or 
repressors, recently determined global distribution patterns 
suggested that CTCF-binding sites are not strongly corre-
lated  with  general  transcription  factor  occupancy  [10]. 
Moreover, depletion of CTCF altered its histone acetylation 
and methylation profiles in the β-globin locus, but did not 
significantly affect β-globin expression [34, 35], suggesting

that  CTCF  has  a  role  distinct  from  that  of  traditional 
regulatory proteins.

Interestingly, CTCF has been shown to serve as a chro-
matin organizer complex by linking chromosomal domains 
in  the  mouse/human  β-globin  cluster  (Fig.  2)  [36,  37]. 
During erythroid differentiation, CTCF is recruited and en-
ables enhancers to physically access promoters of β-globin, 
which  both  influences  transcription  and  contributes  to 
cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function [36, 
37]. Similarly, long-range interactions associated with CTCF 
have been observed within mammalian gene loci including 
the Igf2/H19 imprinted control region [38, 39], the α-globin 
gene cluster in erythroid cells [40], and the Igh locus in B 
cells [41].

DNA methylation and CTCF binding
It has been known for many years that CTCF binding is 
abolished by the DNA methylation of CpG sites within the 
CTCF motif [32]. At the imprinted Igf2/H19 locus, CTCF 
binds specifically to the unmethylated differentially methy-

lated region (DMR), which is required for the expression of 
H19 on the maternal chromosome (Fig. 3A) [32, 42]. However, 
on the paternal allele, the methylated DMR prohibits CTCF 
enrichment and leads to IGF2 expression [30, 42], sugges-
ting  methylation-sensitive  binding  of  CTCF  at  the  target 
region. Interestingly, genome-wide association studies have 
identified that only a small subset of CTCF-binding sites are 
sensitive to the methylation status of DNA [8, 43].

Abnormal DNA  methylation  patterns  of CTCF-binding 
sites are associated with transcriptional regulation of tumor 
suppressor  or  oncogenic  genes  in  several  human  cancers 
[44]. CTCF plays an essential role in maintaining INK/ARF 
gene  expression  and  disruption  of  its  binding  by  DNA 
methylation  contributes  to  the  epigenetic  silencing  of 
INK/ARF  genes  in  human  breast  cancer  cells  [45,  46]. 
Epigenetic  inactivation  of  RASSF1A  and  CDH1  also 
correlates  with  the  epigenetic  alteration  of  CTCF-recog-
nition sites in human breast cancer [46]. Conversely, in one 
study, aberrant DNA methylation led to the prevention of 
CTCF-mediated silencing of the BCL6 gene, thus increasing 
oncogenic BCL6 expression in lymphoma [47]. 

The  concept  that  the  methylation-sensitive  binding  of 
CTCF controls gene expression by changing the chromatin 
architecture has been supported by the finding that CTCF 
alters the chromatin architecture [8]. For instance, in the 
Igf2/H19  locus,  Igf2  imprinting  on  the  maternal  allele  is 
performed by perturbing the proper long-range chromatin 
interactions  between  the  Igf2  gene  and  a  distal  enhancer 
through  the  formation  of  chromatin  loops  mediated  by 
CTCF (Fig. 3A) [38, 39]. However, on the paternal chro-
mosome,  CTCF  enrichment  at  the  DMR  and  insulator 
looping are prevented by DNA methylation, thus ensuring 
physical  interaction  between  the  Igf2  gene  and  the  distal 
enhancer  and  inducing  the  exclusive  expression  of  the 
paternal allele. Similarly, nucleotide excision repair factor- 

mediated  DNA  demethylation  at  the  promoter  region 
induces  the  enrichment  of  CTCF  and  consequently  the 
formation of a looping structure and controls gene expre-
ssion  at  the  RARβ2  locus  [48].  We  also  found  that  epi-
genetic silencing of PTGS2 correlates with the loss of CTCF 
binding  by  DNA  methylation  at  the  promoter  region, 
thereby producing an inappropriate higher-order chromatin 
structure in human gastric cancer cells (Fig. 3B) [49]. 

Somatic mutations at CTCF-binding sites
In several studies, somatic mutations at the coding region 
of  the  CTCF  gene  were  detected  in  acute  leukemia  and 
individuals with intellectual disability [50-52]. However, a 
high frequency of recurrent mutations in the CTCF-binding 
site has been more profoundly found in human cancer [53]. 
Unsurprisingly, single-nucleotide polymorphisms also confer 
disease susceptibility in humans by decreasing the methy-
lation level at differentially methylated CTCF-binding sites 
such as rs2334499 in the 11p15 region [54]. Since genetic 
and/or epigenetic alterations frequently occur in the CTCF 
anchor region in various human cancers [7, 8, 55], these 
mutations can influence gene expression and tumor prog-
ression by abrogating the CTCF-mediated spatial folding of 
chromosomes [56].

Architectural role of CTCF
There is direct evidence that CTCF can physically interact 
with other transcriptional regulators, such as the zinc finger 
protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1), as an X chromosome binary switch 
[57]. CTCF also forms a complex with the SNF2-like chro-
modomain helicase protein (CHD8) [58] and the methyl- 
CpG‒binding  protein  Kaiso  [59]  through  the  zinc-finger 
domain  [10].  Thus,  CHD8  enhances  insulator  activity, 
whereas Kaiso has a negative effect on the CTCF-mediated 
enhancer blocking activity [58, 59].

Interestingly,  the  C-terminus  of  CTCF  preferentially 
interacts with the STAG1 or STAG2 subunit of cohesin [60]. 
Furthermore,  recent  genome-wide  studies  mapping  the 
binding sites of CTCF revealed that CTCF often colocalizes 
with the cohesin complex throughout the genome [61-63]. 
Thus,  CTCF  is  generally  thought  to  be  required  for  the 
localization of cohesin at its binding sites [64]. 

The cohesin complex

Cohesin as a sister chromatid cohesion molecule
Cohesin, a large ring-shaped molecule that can bind DNA 
strands, is a multi-subunit protein complex composed of two 
structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) molecules, 
SMC1 and SMC3, either stromal antigen (STAG) STAG1 or 
STAG2, and the kleisin subunit RAD21 (Fig. 4) [9]. Cohesin 
is required to mediate sister chromatid cohesion for proper 
chromosome segregation in the S phase until cell division 
[65]. The cohesin complex was also found to be involved in 
efficient DNA DSB repair [64]. Since cohesin is important 
for  holding  sister  chromatids  together  following  DNA 
replication, mutational inactivation of the cohesin complex 
causes genomic instability and aneuploidy during cell cycle 
progression in human diseases [11]. For example, Cornelia 
de  Lange  syndrome,  a  rare  autosomal-dominant  develop-
mental  disorder,  is  caused  by  mutation  of  SMC1,  SMC3, 
Rad21, NIPBL, or HDAC8, which encode core components of 
the  cohesin  complex  or  proteins  that  interact  with  this 
complex [66, 67]. Somatic mutations in the cohesin sub-
units have also been frequently found in several different 
human tumor types [68-71].

Cohesin in transcriptional regulation
Although its role in chromatid cohesion during mitosis is 
well established [65], cohesin was also found to bind thou-
sands  of  sites  on  interphase  chromosomes  [4].  Indeed,

cohesin interacts with the Mediator complex, a transcrip-
tional coactivator [72], and co-occupies enhancer and pro-
moter regions with it to regulate tissue-specific gene expre-
ssion  [4].  High-throughput  chromatin  immunoprecipita-
tion‒sequence analyses also revealed that cohesin remains 
bound  at  the  transcription  factor-binding  sites  through 
replication to facilitate the re-establishment of transcription 
factor clusters after DNA replication and cell division [12]. 
This suggests that the cohesin complex acts as a transcrip-
tional regulator in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and 
development [8].

Colocalization of cohesin with CTCF
CTCF was originally known as a cohesin loading factor 
[10, 64] because genome-wide studies revealed that cohesin 
globally colocalizes extensively with CTCF throughout the 
genome  [61,  62,  73].  However,  CTCF  depletion  did  not 
completely  impair  the  entire  association  of  cohesin  with 
chromatin  [61,  73-75].  Instead,  depletion  of  CTCF  was 
shown to reduce the enrichment of cohesin at only a small 
proportion of cohesin-binding sites [61, 74, 75], indicating 
that CTCF facilitates the distribution of cohesin to specific 
sites  on  chromosomes  [8].  In  contrast,  the  depletion  of 
RAD21, a core subunit of the cohesin complex [9], does not 
disrupt  the  enrichment  of  CTCF,  suggesting  that  CTCF 
binding  is  independent  of  the  presence  of  cohesin  on 
chromatin [8]. In this context, the following question arises: 
What is the essential role of cohesin at CTCF-binding sites?

Role of CTCF/cohesin in genome folding
Apart  from  its  major  function  in  sister  chromatid 
cohesion, it has recently been shown that cohesin acts in 
concert  with  CTCF  to  affect  higher-order  chromosome 
architecture  by  forming  long-range  chromosomal  interac-
tions in many developmentally regulated gene families [76]. 
For example, cohesin has been shown to play a critical role in 
maintaining  CTCF-mediated  higher-order  chromatin  con-
formation at the β-globin and Igf2/H19 loci [37, 39, 41, 74]. 
CTCF and cohesin also stabilize the rearrangement of Igh 
and  T-cell receptor  loci via  long-range chromatin  interac-
tions [41, 77, 78].

Although it is not yet clear how CTCF/cohesin mediate 
chromatin looping, CTCF may first bind between two CTCF 
sites and form a complex with cohesin through its C-terminal 
region [60, 79, 80]. Considering the evidence that cohesin 
can tether DNA molecules together [81], a study appeared to 
show that cohesin stabilized long-range chromatin interac-
tions by anchoring DNA strands together within a closed 
ring structure among CTCF/cohesin localization sites [11, 
64,  76].  Interestingly,  CTCF/cohesin-mediated  chromatin 
looping  preferentially  occurs  between  CTCF  sites  with

convergent CTCF DNA motifs [82]. Thus, inverting one site 
of convergent  CTCF-binding sites changes  the  chromatin 
architecture and can alter gene expression [5, 83].

CTCF/cohesin-mediated abnormal higher-order 
chromosome structure during tumor development

Dysregulation of the components of the cohesin complex 
might  promote  genomic  instability  by  perturbing  proper 
long-range  chromatin  interactions,  which  can  confer  the 
spatial proximity required for the rejoining of DSBs during 
chromosomal  rearrangement  [18].  More  recent  studies 
support a similar role for the CTCF/cohesin-mediated chro-
matin loop as a regulator of genome integrity [84]. They 
found that chromosome loop anchors bound by CTCF and 
cohesin  are  vulnerable  to  continuous  DNA  breaks  and 
translocation  breakpoint  regions  in  various  cancers  are 
enriched at these loop anchors [84]. Similarly, we found that 
cohesin-mediated  chromatin  organization  and  DNA 
replication are important for stabilizing gene amplification 
in cancer cells with chromosomal instability (Fig. 5) [85]. 
Although  a  high  frequency  of  recurrent  mutations  and 
deletions of the components of the cohesin complex was 
identified in human diseases [70, 71, 86], aberrant overex-
pression  of  the  cohesin  complex  [9]  was  also  frequently 
detected in various human malignancies [85]. Interestingly, 
we  found  that  overexpression  of  the  cohesin  complex  in 
mesenchymal cancer cells induces mesenchymal to epithelial 
transition‒specific expression patterns and dynamic cohe-

sin-mediated chromatin structures are responsible for the 
initiation  and regulation  of  essential  epithelial  to  mesen-
chymal transition‒related cell fate changes in human cancer 
(Fig. 6) [87].

An increasing amount of recent evidence has indicated 
that CTCF and cohesin are enriched at TADs [6, 15]. Accor-
dingly, cohesin-associated CTCF loops occur within TADs 
and enhancers generally interact with genes within these 
loops [8]. Interestingly, recurrent mutations occur frequently 
within CTCF anchor sites adjacent to oncogenes or cancer- 
associated genes [55]. Mutation in the isocitrate dehydroge-
nase (IDH) gene promotes susceptibility of the CTCF-bin-
ding sites to DNA methylation and the loss of CTCF binding 
resulting in the disruption of TAD organization in human 
gliomas  [88].  Somatic  mutations  change  oncogene-con-
taining insulated neighborhoods, thereby allowing improper 
activation of proto-oncogenes by enhancers located within 
different TADs [89]. Furthermore, disruption of CTCF-me-
diated TAD formation by human noncoding disease variants 
elicits  pathogenic  phenotypes,  providing  the  mechanistic 
linkage between spatial genomic organization and genetic 
alterations that influence gene expression [90].

Conclusion

Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made 
in  understanding  three-dimensional  genome  architecture. 
However,  its  role  in  cancer  remains  incompletely  under-
stood. An intriguing issue in this context is that, although 
most topological boundaries are enriched for the binding of 
CTCF, only 15% of CTCF-binding sites are located within 
TAD  boundaries  [15],  suggesting  that  additional  factors 
other than the CTCF/cohesin complex might be required to 
establish the topological domain structure of the genome 
[17].  Further  work  is  needed  to  clarify  the  mechanisms 
underlying this level of chromosomal organization, and to 
what extent it generally contributes to the transcriptional 
regulation of genes during tumorigenesis.

While  increasing  evidence  has  recently  indicated  that 
enhancers are located near oncogenic genes and exhibit a 
large number of variants associated with diseases [91], a 
more complete understanding of how epigenetic alteration 
of enhancers directly participates in the development and 
onset of genome reorganization during tumor progression 
remains to be obtained. Based on this point, recently deve-
loped  CRISPR/Cas9-based  epigenome-editing  technology 
has  attracted  considerable  interest  because  this  approach 
can  acutely  modify  the  epigenetic  landscape  of  specific 
regulatory elements [92]. For example, targeted editing of 
the DNA methylation status of CTCF-binding sites changes 
CTCT recruitment, thereby altering the expression of genes
