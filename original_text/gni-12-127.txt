of Gastritis or Gastric Ulcer in Korean Populations

Gastritis is a major disease that has the potential to grow as gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is a very common cancer, and it is 
related  to  a  very  high  mortality  rate  in  Korea.  This  disease  is  known  to  have  various  reasons,  including  infection  with 
Helicobacter pylori, dietary habits, tobacco, and alcohol. The incidence rate of gastritis has reported to differ between age, 
population, and gender. However, unlike other factors, there has been no analysis based on gender. So, we examined the 
high risk factors of gastritis in each gender in the Korean population by focusing on sex. We performed an analysis of 120 
clinical characteristics and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using 349,184 single-nucleotide polymorphisms from 
the results of Anseong and Ansan cohort study in the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project. As the result, we could not 
prove  a  strong  relation  with  these  factors  and  gastritis  or  gastric  ulcer  in  the  GWAS.  However,  we  confirmed  several 
already-known risk factors and also found some differences of clinical characteristics in each gender using logistic regression. 
As  a  result  of  the  logistic  regression,  a  relation  with  hyperlipidemia,  coronary  artery  disease,  myocardial  infarction, 
hyperlipidemia therapy, hypotensive or antihypotensive drug, diastolic blood pressure, and gastritis was seen in males; the 
results of this study suggest that vascular disease has a potential association with gastritis in males.

Introduction 

Gastric cancer is a common cancer type. In the world, this 
cancer type has the second highest incidence among males 
and third highest among females [1]. In Korea, the incidence 
rate of gastric cancer was second highest, and the mortality 
rate  of  gastric  cancer  was  third  highest  among  all  cancer 
types in a 2010 Korean cancer statistics study [2].

The  incidence  rate  of  gastric  cancer  differs  between 
patient age, location, and even sex [3], because gastric cancer 
has  various  subtypes  [3,  4]  and  a  lot  of  risk  factors  [5]. 
Helicobacter pylori is known for having a relation with gastric 
cancer [6]. Almost all gastric cancer patients are infected 
with H. pylori [3]. As known before, dietary habits also have 
the potential to affect gastric cancer [1]. The incidence risk 
factors have differences in gastric cancer or peptic ulcers by 
blood type [7] and sex [8]. Gastric cancer type also depends 
on patient populations or race [5]. So, an analysis is needed 
to  find  known  and  unknown  risk  factors  in  diverse 

phenotypes  [3].  Gastritis  is  related  with  gastric  cancer. 
Chronic gastric inflammation has the potential to grow into 
gastric cancer [9]. 

Many  risk  factors  are  related  with  gastritis,  as  already 
reported.  However,  even  though  gender  is  known  to  be 
associated with gastritis infraction, there is not much infor-
mation about the effects on gastritis depending on gender. 
So, we examined Korean risk factors of gastritis and gastric 
ulcer using genotypes and clinical characteristics of patients 
who were diagnosed with gastritis or gastric ulcer in each 
gender. For revealing the correlation with gastritis and known 
and  unknown  risk  factors,  we  analyzed  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and  epidemiological  data  of  the 
Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project,  which  com-
prised the results of the Anseong and Ansan cohorts study.

Anseong and Ansan population study in the KARE projects. 
Anseong is a rural area, and Ansan is a city. Both areas are in 
Gyeonggi-do.  Citizen  of  these  two  cities  have  different 
lifestyles, and they are exposed to different environment. 
Detailed information of the KARE data was reported [10]. 
The KARE data included 8,842 individuals, 352,228 SNPs, 
and 277 phenotypes. 

Among 8,842 total individuals, we divided patients and 
normal subjects for a control and case study using a positive 
diagnosis experience of gastritis. There were 1,885 patients 
and 6,957 normal subjects. First, for selecting the case, we 
eliminated 104 patients who were diagnosed under age 20 or 
had unknown age. Then, 1,781 patients remained. Of these, 
804 patients were men, and 977 patients were women. Of 
6,957 normal subjects, no one was aged under 20; 3,335 
were men, and 3,622 were women. 

Among 352,228 SNPs, we excluded 3,044 SNPs based on 
the  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  test  for  quality  control. 
After  frequency  and  genotyping  pruning,  349,184  SNPs 
remained. 

Among 277 total phenotypes, we filtered missing pheno-
types and low genotyping rates. Then, 120 clinical charac-
teristics remained. We also eliminated gastritis phenotype 
variables  and  unknown  drug  information  variables;  101 
clinical characteristics remained. 

Statistical analysis

For data filtering and finding significant SNPs, we used 
PLINK  version  1.07,  that  is  a  tool  made  for  analyzing 
whole-genome  association  using  computational  methods 
[11]. We used the default options of PLINK [11], and we 
analyzed phenotypes by logistic regression test for classi-
fying patients and normal subjects and estimating factors. 
We also assessed the result factors of the logistic regression 
by  Student’s  t-test  for  revealing  meaningful  differences 
between patients and normal subjects using R version 3.0.2 
for finding gastritis-associated factors. Then, we used the 
receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  curve  and  area 
under  the  curve  (AUC)  scores  to  confirm  the  prediction 
ability of the factors.

Tables 1 and 2 explain the results of the logistic regression 
test among total clinical characteristics in each gender. There 
were differences in gender-specific clinical characteristics. 
Among 1,781 total patients, 977 patients and 804 patients 
were  male  and  female,  respectively.  Patients  had  several

diagnosis  of  hyperlipidemia,  positive  diagnosis  of  mental 
disease,  continual  use  of  one  or  more  drugs,  waist,  and 
height.

Through previous studies, how these factors are related 

with gastritis was verified.

The  incidence  of  gastritis  is  affected  by  population, 
geographic variation, or lifestyle [1, 5]. In this study, we used 
cohort data that comprised country and city populations. As 
shown Tables 1 and 2, in both genders, the population of 
local A had a higher gastritis incidence rate. This means that 
differences in patient lifestyle and environment affect the 
disease incidence rate. 

It is well known that stress has an influence on carcino-
genesis. A study reported that gastritis is closely connected 
with mental illness [12] and differs in degree according to 
drug  use−taking  medicine  affects  the  stomach.  Nonste-
roidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  can  cause  gastrointestinal 
damage [13]. 

Losing appetite is the one of phenotypes of gastritis that 
are  connected  with  waist  size  or  hip  size  as  gastritis- 
associated  factors.  However,  definite  evidence  is  lacking 

[14].  As  shown  in  Tables  1  and  2,  we  can  explain  the 
associative  relation  that  waist  size  or  hip  size  is  smaller 
despite  patients  being  taller  than  normal.  Also,  height  is 
considered  to  be  a  gastritis  risk  factor.  As  shown  in  a 
previous study, higher height tends to increase the gastric 
cancer incidence rate [15].

In  males  and  females,  hyperlipidemia  and  gastritis  are 
related with gastritis. Only male cases are associated with 
vascular disease. Coronary artery has the potential to grow 
into myocardial infarction [16], and myocardial infarction is 
related with blood pressure [17]. As previously reported, 
approximately 30% of patients with coronary heart disease 
suffer  from  hyperlipidemia  at  the  same  time  [18].  So, 
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery, and myocardial infarction 
are all related to each other. As shown in Table 1, in males, by 
logistic regression, there is a relation with hyperlipidemia, 
coronary artery, myocardial infarction, hyperlipidemia the-
rapy, hypotensive or antihypotensive drug use, and diastolic 
blood pressure. This relation is more remarkable in males 
than in females. Repeatedly, it can be considered that vas-
cular disease is connected with gastritis. In fact, in this study,

including males and females, 16 patients had gastritis and 
myocardial infarction (20%), 77 patients had gastritis and 
hyperlipidemia  (36%),  and  13  patients  had  gastritis  and 
coronary artery (25.5%). 

Female  patients  with  gastritis  have  4  more  gastritis- 

associated factors by logistic regression test compared with 
males.  In  the  case  of  taking  osteoporosis  medicine,  the 
incidence rate is 1.7 times higher compared with normal. 
Taking  anticonvulsants  is  a  meaningful  factor  by  logistic 
regression test, but few patients were taking this medicine

associated factors in males. This shows how well the 22 gastritis- 
associated  clinical  characteristic  factors  (Table  1)  classify  patients 
and normal  subjects in males.  As  much  as  the ROC curve,  these 
factors can classify gastritis patients and normal subjects in males.

associated factors in females. This shows how well the 26 gastritis-
associated  clinical  characteristic  factors  (Table  2)  classify  patients 
and normal subjects in females. As much as the ROC curve, these
factors can classify gastritis patients and normal subjects in females.

[4]; so, it is hard to prove that taking anticonvulsants has a 
positive relation with gastritis. Patients who were diagnosed 
with tuberculosis and patients who have taken tuberculosis 
drugs suffer gastritis more than normal subjects. This gives 
information on the relation between gastritis and tubercu-
losis in females.

ROC curves can show how gastritis-associated factors of 
Tables 1 and 2 affect gastritis patients and normal subjects. 
Whether these factors are conclusive should be confirmed by 
AUC values. Figs. 1 and 2 are ROC curves using the result of 
the logistic regression test of Tables 1 and 2, respectively. 
Each AUC value is 0.697 and 0.687. This result means that 
these factors are not useful as gastric-specific markers.

Genome-wide association studies

We selected the top 20 ranked SNPs by association test 
using chi-square test and p-values among 349,184 SNPs in 
males  and  in  females,  respectively.  The  results  of  SNPs 
association analysis described in Tables 3 and 4. Tables 3 and 
4 are top 20 ranked SNPs of genomewide association analysis 
in  males  and  females,  respectively.  They  are  sorted  by 
P-value. But there was no considerable SNP associated with 
gastritis. Astonishingly, there was no common SNP between 
males  and  females.  This  means  that  associated-SNPs  are 
different, depending on the patient’s gender.

Table  5  describes  the  important  SNPs  associated  with 
gastritis by logistic regression analysis among the top 20 
ranked SNPs. The p-values of these SNPs were all ＜0.001.

Figs. 3 and 4 show the ROC curve by using these SNPs in 
males and in females, respectively. The AUC scores are 0.675 
and 0.658 in males and in females, respectively. The AUC 
score was too low to use as a specific factor for diagnosis.

Discussion

In  this  study,  we  confirmed  that  vascular  disease  and 
gastritis have considerable association in Korean males. We 
also verified that gastritis is affected by other various drugs. 
However, we could not find gastritis-specific biomarkers for 
diagnosis.

Gastritis  has  numerous  causes  and  is  distributed  as

variable subtypes by phenotype. So, correctly diagnosing it is 
very important for therapy. Gastritis has non-specific phe-
notypes  that  can  obscure  finding  the  disease  causes.  So, 

more  information  is  also  needed  to  analyze  the  complex 
factors  associated  with  disease  rather  than  each  factor 
associated with the disease. For example, confirmation of H. 
pylori infection, tobacco, smoking period, and alcohol intake 
are considered. This needs further study.
