Abstract
The earliest stages of mammalian embryogenesis are 
governed by the activity of maternally inherited transcripts 
and proteins. Cytoplasmic polyadenylation of selected 
maternal mRNA has been reported to be a major control 
mechanism of delayed translation during preimplantation 
embryogenesis in mice. The presence of cis-elements 
required for cytoplasmic polyadenylation (e.g., CPE) can 
serve as a useful tag in the screening of maternal genes 
partaking in key functions in the transcriptionally dormant 
egg  and  early  embryo.  However,  due  to  its  relative 
simplicity, UA-rich sequences satisfying the canonical rule 
of known CPE consensus sequences are often found in 
the 3’-UTR of maternal transcripts that do not actually 
undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation. In this study, we 
developed a method to confirm the validity of candidate 
CPE sequences in a given gene by a multiplex comparison 
of 3’-UTR sequences between mammalian homologs. We 
found that genes undergoing cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
tend to create a conserved block around the CPE, while 
CPE-like  sequences  in  the  3’-UTR  of  genes  lacking 
cytoplasmic polyadenylation do not exhibit such conservation 
between species. Through this cross-species comparison, 
we also identified an alternative CPE in the 3’-UTR of 
tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), which is more 
likely to serve as a functional element. We suggest that 
verification of CPEs based on sequence conservation can 
provide a convenient tool for mass screening of factors 
governing the earliest processes of mammalian embryogenesis.

Introduction
In all metazoan species, maternal mRNAs are synthesized 
and stored in the egg cytoplasm in a translationally dormant 
form. During oocyte maturation and early development, 
timely activation of these mRNAs promotes synthesis of 
key proteins, orchestrating the second meiotic division, 
fertilization, and cleavage (Davidson, 1986). A mechanism 
unique  to  this  period  is  known  to  control  the  timely 
translation of selected maternal messages by modulating 
the length of the poly(A) tail in the cytoplasm. (Richter, 
1999;  Mendez  and  Richter,  2001).  This  secondary 
elongation  of  the  poly(A)  tail  is  termed  cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation, to distinguish it from the original process 
occurring  in  the  nucleus.  The  essential  nature  of  this 
process has been well demonstrated in experiments in 
which impairment of cytoplasmic polyadenylation blocked 
timely  translation  of  corresponding  genes  and normal 
embryonic development (Gebauer et al., 1994; Lieberfarb 
et al., 1996).

The cis-elements necessary for cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
(e.g.,  CPE)  are  located  in  the  vicinity  of  the  nuclear 
polyadenylation signal, and they trigger elongation of the 
poly(A) tail in the egg and zygote (Stebbins-Boaz et al., 
1997; de Moore and Richter, 2001). Since the earliest 
period  of  embryonic  development  is  still  governed  by 
maternally inherited factors, presence of a CPE in the 
3’-UTR serves as a useful marker for genes partaking in 
key functions at the onset of mammalian embryogenesis 
(Ohsugi et al., 1996; Oh et al., 1997; Read and Norbury, 
2002). However, due to its relative simplicity, the UA-rich 
sequences satisfying the canonical rule of the mammalian 
CPE (usually UUUUAU) are often found in the 3’-UTR of 
genes that do not undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
(Hwang et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2006). Unfortunately, 
experimental  verification  of  poly(A)  elongation  is  not 
feasible  for  mammalian  maternal  mRNAs  due  to  the 
inaccessibility of oocytes and early embryos.

While the nucleotide sequence of a typical mammalian 
gene shows strict conservation between homologs within 

the ORF, the degree of similarity tends to decrease sharply 
in the 3’-UTR. Yet there appear to be limited regions of 
conserved  blocks  around  known  3’-UTR  elements, 
indicating their functional importance. Examples of such 
cases include the hexanucleotide nuclear polyadenylation 
signal (AAUAAA or AUUAAA) and the instability elements 
of cytokines (Seko et al., 2006; Paschoud et al., 2006). In 
this study, we examined whether the 3’-UTR sequences 
around the CPE also create a conserved island across 
multiple mammalian species. We found that sequence 
conservation around a potential CPE reflects the validity 
of  this  cis-element,  which  may  provide  a  convenient 
measure to distinguish genes involved in the onset of 
mammalian embryogenesis.

of the missing regions was generated using overlapping 
EST fragments. 

Interspecies  alignment  of  3’-UTR  sequences  was 
performed with homologs from the genomes of human 
(Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), pig (Sus scrofa), 
and  cow  (Bos  taurus)  (Choi  et  al.,  2006).  Quadruple 
alignments of sequences were performed by the ClustalW 
program of the MEGA3 software using standard parameters 
(Kumar et al., 2004).

Results and Discussion
Conservation of 3’-UTR sequences around CPEs 
of mammalian cell adhesion molecules 
Like other mouse proteins controlling the earliest developmental 
process, cell adhesion molecules involved in the compaction 
of  the  8-cell  stage  embryo  are  produced  by  timely 
translation of stored maternal messages (Ohsugi et al., 
1996). Compacting embryos showed strong expression of 
E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin at the junction of 
blastomeres. It has been demonstrated that the poly(A) tail 
of  these  transcripts  is  elongated  by  several  hundred 
nucleotides before the activation of protein synthesis (Oh 
et  al.,  2000).  Potential  CPE  sequences  meeting  the 
canonical  consensus  from  mouse  genes  known  to 
undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation are present in the 
3’-UTRs of E-cadherin, α-catenin, and β-catenin (Gebauer 
et al., 1994; Richards et al., 1993). γ-catenin (also known 
as plakoglobin) constitutes the third component of the 
cadherin-catenin  complex  in  certain  cell  types,  but  γ
-catenin protein is not detected in the compaction stage 
of the embryo (Ohsugi et al., 1996). Interestingly, the 
3’-UTR of mouse γ-catenin does not have any UA-rich 
sequences satisfying the CPE consensus sequence.

In this study, we compared the distal 3’ end of transcripts 
encoding the cadherin-catenin complex by a multiplex 
alignment of four mammalian homologs. From the known 
cases of mouse and Xenopus CPEs, we built a broader 
consensus  sequence  defined  as  any  UA-rich  stretch 
resembling (A)UUUU(U)AU and residing within approximately 
100 nucleotides from the nuclear polyadenylation signal. 
As shown in Fig. 1, the 3’ end of E-cadherin, α-catenin, and 
β-catenin all possess hexanucleotide nuclear polyadenylation 
signals (either AAUAAA or AUUAAA), perfectly conserved 
among the four mammalian genes examined (boxes with 
broken lines). Equally well conserved in mammals were 
sequences around the candidate CPE sequences of these 
genes (box with solid lines). We also noticed additional 
UA-rich sequences in the 3’-UTR of α-catenin that were 
strictly conserved in all four species (Fig. 1 B, underlined),

although  it  showed  slight  deviation  from  the  known 
consensus CPE. This result implies the functional importance 
of CPEs in the timely translation of corresponding proteins 
in the early embryos.

For β-catenin, the validity of the downstream UUUUAAUU 
(Fig. 1 C, underlined) had been in question because it is 
located past the nuclear polyadenylation signal. However, 
cyclin B1 mRNA of Xenopus has a functional CPE that 
overlaps the nuclear polyadenylation signal (de Moore and 
Richter, 1999). In the present study, conservation of the 
UUUUAAUU sequence of β-catenin adds to the possibility 
that  CPEs  may  reside  downstream  of  the  nuclear 
polyadenylation signal as well.

Absence of cross-species conservation around 
CPE-like sequences in maternal transcripts that 
do not undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation
Timely polyadenylation of stored maternal messages in 
the cytoplasm can be monitored by Northern blot analysis 
of oocytes and embryos (Oh et al., 2000). In this analysis,

homologs  of  maternal  transcripts  that  avoid  cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation. A: β‐actin, B: Melk, C: γ‐catenin (plakoglobin). 
Boxes with  broken lines  indicate the  hexanucleotide nuclear 
polyadenylation signal. Candidate CPE sequences are marked

RNaseH digestion after oligo-dT hybridization abolished 
the upward shift of the Northern band, indicating that the 
size increase was contributed by the addition of the poly(A) 
tail. According to this method, transcripts of mouse β-actin 
and Melk do not undergo cytoplasmic polyadenylation 
despite their abundance in the egg and early embryo (Oh 
et al., 2000). However, the 3’-UTR of these messages 
contain  several  UA-rich  sequences  observing  the 
canonical rule of the CPE (Fig. 2). One explanation for this 
dilemma might be the fact that CPE-like sequences of β
-actin and Melk transcripts are located beyond the cut-off 
distance from the nuclear polyadenylation signal, which 
is generally believed to be approximately 100 nucleotides. 
Interestingly, these CPE-like sequences are not conserved 
between mammalian homologs (Fig. 2 A and B; see boxes 
with solid lines). We also noticed a similar deviation in the 

3’-UTR  alignment  of  γ-catenin,  which  is  not  actively 
translated in the mouse egg and embryo. There are no 
CPE-like sequences in the 3’ end of mouse γ-catenin, but 
the  other  three  mammals  contain  UUUUAU  motifs 
(underlined) about 60 nucleotides away from the nuclear 
polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2 C). Such divergence may 
reflect the fact that the corresponding area had not been 
under the force of evolutionary conservation, presumably 
because  they  do  not  participate  in  the  cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation. Taken together, our results suggest that 
examination of interspecies conservation is one way to 
determine the authenticity of candidate CPEs.

Suggestion  for  an  alternative  CPE  in  tPA  via 
cross-species alignment of 3’-UTR
The protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was 
one of the first vertebrate genes shown to undergo cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation  in  developing  oocytes  (Huarte  et  al., 
1987). Since the presence of tPA protein can be determined 
by zymography, it is possible to monitor its translation from 
a small number of mouse eggs. The 3’-UTR of mouse tPA 
contains a variety of CPE-like sequences, including two 
AUUUUAAU stretches. A series of antisense inhibition 
tests demonstrated that an oligonucleotide targeting the 
downstream AUUUUAAU abolished the timely translation 
of tPA after ovulation (Richards et al., 1993), suggesting 
that this element is involved in the translational activation 
of stored maternal messages in the egg. To our surprise, 
both upstream and downstream AUUUUAAU sequences 
were not conserved between mammals (Fig. 3, boxes with 
solid lines). Instead, a strict conservation was noticed from 
another UA-rich sequence, UAUUUAUA (box with solid 
lines), juxtaposed to the downstream AUUUUAAU sequence. 
Interestingly, the antisense oligo inhibiting tPA translation 
in  the  experiments  by  Richards  et  al.  included  the 
UAUUUAUA sequence as well. According to what has 
been observed from maternal transcripts examined in this 
study, the conserved UAUUUAUA sequence, instead of

homologs of tPA (tissue‐type plasminogen activator). Boxes

signal. Previously known CPE sequences are marked by boxes

study is double‐underlined.

Verification of CPE by interspecies alignment 177

AUUUUAAU, most likely serves as a functional CPE in 
oocytes. It would be intriguing to test whether disrupting 
UAUUUAUA alone can inhibit the translation of tPA in the 
egg.

Taken  together,  sequence  conservation  between 
related species may designate the validity of given CPE-like 
elements. Such a measure could be particularly useful in 
mammals  wherein  direct  verification  of  cytoplasmic 
polyadenylation is not practical due to the paucity of egg 
and early stage embryos. We suggest that screening of 
CPE-containing genes using this method will contribute to 
the understanding of cellular events occurring at the onset 
of mammalian embryogenesis.
