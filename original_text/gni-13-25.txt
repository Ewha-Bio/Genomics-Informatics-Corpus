Since the advent of next-generation sequencing, we have 
realized that a substantial amount of the human genome, not 
just the 2% to 5% of the human genome that is occupied by 
coding genes, is transcribed, which means that there is a 
substantial  amount  of  non-protein-coding  RNAs  in  the 
human genome. Non-coding RNAs are RNA transcripts that 
are not translated into proteins; some of them play a role in 
the  regulation  of  gene  expression  and  will  be  eventually 
implicated in on diverse diseases, including cancer. In this 
issue, Dr. Yong Sun Lee (University of Texas) reviewed the 
implications  of  a  novel  type  of  non-coding  RNA,  nc886, 
which was recently discovered by his group. nc886 is known 
to  have  putative  tumor  suppressor  and  tumor-sensing 
functions. In this review, the characteristics and roles of this 

ncRNA in tumorigenesis are introduced. Dr. Namshin Kim’s 
group  (KOBIC)  reported  the  effect  of  exome  sequencing 
depth on the discovery of sequence variants for clinical use. 
They suggested the optimal sequencing depth for defining 
most  diverse  function-related  variants,  which  would  be 
useful  for  next-generation  sequencing  based  biomedical 
research  and  clinical  translation.  Dr.  Jung  Kyoon  Choi’s 
group  (KAIST)  investigated  how  transcription  and  epige-
netic processes are genetically regulated and associated with 
each other. For this purpose, they examined the changes in 
chromatin accessibility and gene expression in response to 
genetic variation by means of quantitative trait loci mapping. 
In addition, there are three articles on in silico modeling.
