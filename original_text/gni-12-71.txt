The tRNA structure contains conserved modifications that are responsible for its stability and are involved in the initiation and 
accuracy of the translation process. tRNA modification enzymes are prevalent in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. tRNA 
Gm18 methyltransferase (TrmH) and tRNA m1G37 methyltransferase (TrmD) are prevalent and essential enzymes in bacterial 
populations. TrmH involves itself in methylation process at the 2‘-OH group of ribose at the 18th position of guanosine (G) 
in tRNAs. TrmD methylates the G residue next to the anticodon in selected tRNA subsets. Initially, m1G37 modification was 
reported to take place on three conserved tRNA subsets (tRNAArg, tRNALeu, tRNAPro); later on, few archaea and eukaryotes 
organisms  revealed  that  other  tRNAs  also  have  the  m1G37  modification.  The  present  study  reveals  Gm18,  m1G37 
modification, and positions of m1G that take place next to the anticodon in tRNA sequences. We selected extremophile 
organisms and attempted to retrieve the m1G and Gm18 modification bases in tRNA sequences. Results showed that the 
Gm18 modification G residue occurs in all tRNA subsets except three tRNAs (tRNAMet, tRNAPro, tRNAVal). Whereas the m1G37 
modification base G is formed only on tRNAArg, tRNALeu, tRNAPro, and tRNAHis, the rest of the tRNAs contain adenine (A) next 
to the anticodon. Thus, we hypothesize that Gm18 modification and m1G modification occur irrespective of a G residue in 
tRNAs.

Introduction

Marinobacter species is one of the most ubiquitous classes 
formed in the marine ecosystem.  It occurs throughout the 
water  column  in  deep  oceans,  and  it  exerts  a  significant 
impact  on  various  biogeochemical  cycles.  Marinobacter 
aquaeolei is involved in redox reactions that utilize oxygen 
and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors [1]. It exhibits 
hydrocarbon-degrading  mechanisms  and  is  capable  of  di-
verse  extremophilic  attributes  (psychrophily,  oligotrophy, 
and halotolerance) [2]. Marinomonas MWYL1 is able to grow 
on  the  betaine  molecule  and  use  dimethylsulfoniopro-
pionate  (DMSP)  as  their  sole  carbon  source.  Dimethyl 
sulphide is released as a by-product of metabolism of DMSP 
and  reaches  the  atmosphere,  which  subsequently  forms 

cloud  condensation  nuclei  during  oxidation  [3].  The  key 
gene  (dddD)  in  M.  MWYL1  encodes for acetyl-CoA trans-
ferase, which adds CoA to DMSP, prior to its subsequent 
cleavage [4]. Thus, M. MWYL1 is involved in the cycling of 
the climate-changing gas DMS, and their genomic potential 
still needs to be unraveled. Nitrobacter hamburgensis, a gram- 
negative bacterium, forms a biofilm, which is considered a 
suitable  alternative  for  the  treatment  of  wastewater  that 
otherwise requires large and expensive reactors for efficient 
bioremediation [5]. Nitrobacter winogradskyi inhabits many 
soil types, natural stones, as well as both fresh and salt water. 
It derives its energy at once through nitrite oxidation and 
carbon dioxide fixation, thus acting as a chemolithoauto-
troph.  The  gammaproteobacterium  class  of  Nitrosococcus 
oceani is an obligate chemolithoautotroph capable of extrac-
ting  energy  and  reducing  power  from  the  oxidation  of

ammonia to nitrite. N. oceani’s impact on the ecosystem is the 
massive release of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen gases into the 
atmosphere, thus completing the nitrification cycle. It also 
contributes to the maintenance of concentrations of nitrate 
in the nitrogen pool of the deep ocean at 40 μM [6].

Insight into tRNA modifications

tRNA is a small chain of nucleotides that decipher the 
genetic code to protein synthesis on codon and anticodon 
interactions and has a potential role in DNA repair mecha-
nism tRNA methyltransferase brings changes in the nucle-
osides  in  the  tRNA  structure.  Recently,  some  of  these 
nucleoside modifications have been reported to be involved 
in the cell response to environmental stress and in the repair 
of  DNA  damage  as  well.  In  many  cases,  the  posttran-
scriptional modification of tRNA has facilitated translation 
of  deviant  sense  codons  [7],  and  these  modifications  are 
essential for tRNA folding function. The amino acyl tRNA 
synthetase  recognizes  the  cognate  tRNA  through  their 
structure  and  chemistry,  contributed  by  modified  nucle-
osides at the anticodon loop [8]. Thus, the modification of 
stem  and  loop  structures  of  tRNAs  regulates  gene  ex-
pression  by  ordering  conformation  and  dynamics  for  re-
cognition  of  the  codon  and  maintenance  of  the  reading 
frame.  Similarly,  mRNAs  are  programmed  to  shift  their 
frame  when  there  is  no  modification  in  tRNA  [8].  In  an 
actively  dividing  cell,  tRNA  gene  content  determines  the 
relative  abundance  of  tRNA  isoacceptor,  which,  in  turn, 
determines  codon  translation  efficiency  [9].  The  relative 
abundance  of  a  particular  tRNA  isoacceptor  is  kingdom- 
specific, and enzymes present in the organism increase the 
translational efficiency of codons through modification in 
the  anticodon  wobble  base.  It  implies  that  the  modified 
enzymes  play  a  major  role  in  the  evolution  of  genomic 
composition  [9].  Methylation  reactions  account  for  the 
majority of posttranscriptional modifications in tRNA [10]. 
tRNA methyltransferase (Trm) catalyzes the modification 
along the length of tRNA, including at the anticodon site. 
Indeed, Trm has a potential and crucial role in enhancing the 
synthesis of proteins that participate in the damage response 
[11].

tRNA Gm18 methyltransferase (TrmH)

To date, 150 modified nucleosides have been identified in 
RNA, and in tRNA alone 92 such modifications have been 
recorded  [12].  Prominent  among  those  are  2'-OH  ribose 
methylated nucleoside, which is commonly found in tRNAs. 
The  posttranscriptional  modification  in  RNA  is  mediated 
through  specific  methyltransferase  enzymes  [13].  These 
modifications can occur in the noncoding region of the RNA 
sequences.  In  fact,  tRNA  contains  abundant  modified 

nucleosides, which stabilize the L-shaped tRNA structure 
and improves their molecular recognition [14]. A conserved 
guanosine is present at position 18 in the D loop of t-RNA 
modified  to  2'-OH  methyl  guanosine.  This  modification 
stabilizes  the L-shaped  structure of t-RNA by interacting 
with pseudouridine 55 [15]. The enzyme TrmH catalyzes the 
reaction  through  transfer  of  a  methyl  group  from  S- 
adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) to the 2'-OH group of the 
G18  ribose  in  tRNA  D-loops  [16].  The  TrmH  gene  in 
Escherichia coli [17], Thermus thermophilus [18], and Aquifex 
aeolicus  [19]  has  been  identified  to  have  similar  catalytic 
motifs in them. TrmH is subdivided into two classes based 
on their substrate tRNA specificity. The type I enzymes are 
involved in the modification of all tRNA species, whereas 
type II modifies only a subset of tRNA species [20]. The 
Gm18 modification contributes towards defense reactions 
during pathogen encounters and has been observed in high 
frequency  both  in  eukaryotes  and  prokaryotes,  including 
viral RNA [21]. Therefore, a Gm18 modification study gains 
a significant factor of an infectious microbe, as it acts as a 
toll-like receptor 7 antagonist [21], and it can be utilized as 
an anti-inflammatory drug as well [20].
tRNA m1G37 methyltransferase (TrmD)

Lots of modified nucleosides are present at the region of 
anticodons, specifically at  positions  34  (the  wobble  posi-
tion) and 37 (3' and adjacent to the anticodon). One of them 
is the 1-methyl guanosine (m1G) modification occurring at 
position 37 in tRNA [22]. This modification is catalyzed by 
TrmD, which catalyzes the addition of a methyl group from 
AdoMet to G at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon [23]. 
The specificity of this enzyme is determined by V, T, and D 
side loops and the presence of a G36pG37 sequence [24]. 
TrmD is a vital enzyme for maintaining the correct reading 
frame during translation [25]. Lack of this modification at 
the 37th position (i.e., next to the anticodon) leads to a +1 
frameshift and hinders the translation efficiency [26]. The 
nucleus-encoded  tRNA  is  methylated  at  G  before  being 
transported to the cytoplasm, whereas in mitochondria, the 
tRNA is methylated at G37 by a nucleus-encoded enzyme 
and transported into organelles [27]. Both TrmH and TrmD 
enzymes are under the class of the SpoU family and share 
similar catalytic reactions [28]. Hence, the study confirms 
that  tRNA  subsets  contain  G  bases  at  the  18th  position 
(D-loop) and next to the anticodon (anticodon loop).

The presence of Gm18 modification bases were analyzed 
in total tRNAs of M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL1, N. hamburgensis, N. 
winogradskyi, and N. oceani. These organisms’ tRNA contains 
a G residue at the 18th position adjacent to the anticodon 
loop, except tRNAMet, tRNAPro, and tRNAVal (Table 1). Fur-
thermore, the 18th position of tRNAs in M. aquaeolei (51 
tRNAs) and M. MWYL1 (83 tRNAs) contain thymine (T), 
cytosine (C), or adenine (A) instead of G residue. M. aquaeolei’s 
CAT  (two  copies),  tRNAPro
tRNAMet
CGG,  and 
tRNAPro
TGG have T instead of G residues. M. MWYL1 contains 
9 copies of tRNAMet
CAT; of these, six tRNAs have a T residue 
at the 18th position and three contain a G residue at the 18th 
position. Only three proline-specific tRNAs are formed in M. 
MWYL1, and all of them show a T base at the 18th position 
instead of G. The organism N. hamburgensis comprises 50 
tRNA  subsets;  among  these,  eight  tRNAs  showed  no  G 
residue at the 18th position, and the rest of the 42 had a G 
residue. Thus, the tRNAs without G residues are tRNAMet
CAT, 
CGG  (three  copies),  tRNAPro
tRNAPro
TGG,  and 
tRNAVal
GAC.  Therefore,  eight  tRNAs  at  the  18th  position 
show  T,  C,  or  A.  Besides  tRNAMet
CAT,  tRNAPro
CGG  and 
GGG  show  a  C  residue,  and  tRNAPro
tRNAPro
CGG  and 
tRNAPro
TGG hold a T residue at the 18th position. Never-
theless,  tRNAVal
GAC  confirmed  an  A  residue  at  the  18th 
position. Among six proline-specific tRNAs (tRNAPro
CGG), 
only one showed a G residue at the 18th position. Further-
more,  N.  winogradskyi  and  N.  oceani  revealed  47  and  45 
tRNAs,  respectively.  These  two  organisms  hold  similar 

GGG,  tRNAPro

M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL, N. hamburgensis, N. winogradskyi, 
and  N.  oceani  have  common  conserved  tRNA  subsets 
(tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAPro) that contain a G residue at 
the 38th position (G37pG38) next to the anticodon. Varia-
tions  of  the  G  residue  in  archaea  Methanococcus  jannaschii 
tRNAs, such as tRNACys (G35pG36); tRNAHis, and tRNAArg 
(G36pG37);  tRNAGln  and  tRNATry  (G37pG38);  tRNAArg, 
tRNAPro,  and  tRNASer  (G37pG39);  tRNALeu,  tRNAGlu, 
tRNATrp, tRNASer, and tRNAPro (G39pG40) [31] are already 
revealed. M. aquaeolei, M. MWYL1, and N. hamburgensis share 
similar tRNA subsets (tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAPro) that 
contain a G residue at the 38th position (G37pG38) next to 
the anticodon (Table 1). N. winogradskyi loses the G residue 
in tRNAArg, but it has presented it at the 38th position in 
tRNAHis
CGG, 
tRNAPro
TGG. N. oceani contains conserved 
tRNAs (tRNAArg
TAG, 
tRNAPro
TGG) in which the G residue 
(G37pG38) is presented next to the anticodon (Table 1). An 
interesting finding is that tRNAMet and tRNAPro are the 
only two tRNA copies that do not have a G residue at 18th 
position in all of these organisms (Fig. 1). Additionally, the 
tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAHis share common properties, 
except tRNAPro. But, tRNAPro has a G residue at the 18th and 
38th positions in these five organisms (Fig. 2).

M  Subramanian,  et  al.  Guanosine  at  18th  Position  and  Next  to  the  Anticodon  in  tRNAs

Fig.  1.  tRNAs  sequences  are  marked  at  18th  positions,  in  all 
organism  where  tRNAMet  and  tRNAPro  sequences  hold  A,  T  or  C 
instead  of  G  at  18th  position.

Discussion

Fig. 2. tRNA sequences with G residue occur at 38th position next
to  the  anticodon  (G37pG38  sequence).

It is proposed that G18 modification base occurrence and 
non-occurrence in tRNA subsets in Marinobacter is attributed 
to the inhabitably extreme environments (M. aquaeolei, M. 
MWYL1),  including  chemolithotropic  N.  hamburgensis,  N. 
winogradskyi, and N. oceani. Thus, a notable finding is that 
only methionine- and proline-specific tRNAs do not have a G 
residue at the 18th position, and even its absence at the 18th 
position does not hamper the possibility to methylate the 
2'-OH  group  of  ribose  in  tRNAs.  It  might  be  a  modified 
Gm18 base (D loop) that interacts with a  ψ55 tertiary base 
(T loop) for conformational rigidity of the tRNA structure 
[32]. Another finding is the m1G modification site in tRNAs, 
in which it was previously reported that only three types of 
tRNAs (tRNAArg, tRNALeu, and tRNAPro) held a G base next 
to the anticodon [22, 33]. Later, the m1G modification was 
reported in additional tRNAs, such as tRNAGln in archaea 
and tRNAAsp in eukaryotes [34]. A study reported tRNAGln 
with m1G in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, tRNAPhe with 
m1G  in  Staphylococcus  aureus  MRSA252,  and  Streptococcus 
pneumoniae D39 [31]. The Gm18 modification base G is con-
served in these five organisms. For instance, tRNAMet and 
tRNAPro  sequences  do  not  have  a  G  residue  at  the  18th 
position. Furthermore, the N. hamburgensis organism does 
not have a G residue in tRNAVal
GAC. The m1G and its location 
are  highly  conserved  and  located  at  the  38th  position  in 
tRNAs. Mostly the purine bases G or A are placed next to the 
anticodon in all tRNAs. This modification may influence the 
codon-anticodon interaction in the translation process [35]. 

These findings suggest that either these two modifications 
are  not  necessary  to  occur  in  all  tRNAs  or  might  occur 
with/without G residues at the respective positions. Hence, 
we  conclude  that  the  Gm18  modifications  and  m1G37 
tRNAs are essential in all three domains and have revealed a 
conserved tRNAs with m1G37 in a few marine and chemo-
lithoautotrophs. Further study is called for to include more 
marine and extremophiles to gain insights into tRNA modi-
fication bases and their role in biological processes.
