Abstract

Hypertension  is  the  major  factor  of  most  death  and  high 
blood  pressure  (BP)  can  lead  to  stroke,  myocardial  in-
farction  and  cardiac  failure.  Moreover,  hypertension  is 
strongly  correlated  with  body  mass  index  (BMI).  Al-
though  the  exact  causes  of  hypertension  are  still  un-
clear,  some  of  genetic  loci  were  discovered  from  ge-
nome-wide  association  study  (GWAS).  Therefore,  it  is 
essential  to  study  genetic  variation  for  finding  more  ge-
netic  factor  affecting  hypertension.  The  purpose  of  our 
study  is  to  conduct  a  CNV  association  study  for  hyper-
tension-related  traits,  BP  and  BMI,  in  Korean  individuals. 
We  identified  2,206  CNV  regions  from  3,274  commun-
ity-based  Korean  participants  using  the  Affymetrix  Ge-
nome-Wide  Human  SNP  Array  6.0  platform  and  per-
formed  a  logistic  regression  analysis  of  CNVs  with  two 
hypertension-related  traits,  BP  and  BMI.  Moreover,  the 
4,692  participants  in  an  independent  cohort  were  se-
lected  for  respective  replication  analyses.  GWAS  of  CNV 
identified  two  loci  encompassing  previously  known  hy-
pertension-related  genes: LPA  (lipoprotein)  on  6q26,  and 
JAK2  (Janus  kinase  2)  on  9p24,  with  suggestive  p-val-
ues  (0.0334  for  LPA  and  0.0305  for  JAK2).  These  two 
positive  findings,  however,  were  not  evaluated  in  the 
replication  stage.  Our  result  confirmed  the  conclusion  of 
CNV  study  from  the  WTCCC  suggesting  weak  associa-
tion  with  common  diseases.  This  is  the  first  study  of 
CNV  association  study  with  BP  and  BMI  in  Korean  pop-
ulation  and  it  provides  a  state  of  CNV  association  study 
with  common  human  diseases  using  SNP  array.

Introduction

Copy  number  variation  (CNV)  is  defined  as  a  loss  or 
gain  of  long  segments  of  DNA,  and  it  is  relatively  com-
mon  in  the  human  genome  (Freeman  et al.,  2006; 
McCarroll  et al.,  2008;  Redon  et al.,  2006).  Because 
some  chromosomal  duplications  and  deletions  are  known 
to  be  associated  with  disease  susceptibility  and  gene 
dosage,  CNVs  are  considered  major  sources  of  genomic 
variation  along  with  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SN-
Ps)  (Freeman et al.,  2006;  McCarroll et al.,  2008).  A  CNV 
study  has  reported  population-dependent  CNVs  that  in-
consistently  occur  between  ethnic  groups  (Redon et al., 
2006).
    To  date,  a  number  of  genomic  variants  associating 
SNP  loci  with  susceptibility  to  common  complex  human 
diseases  have  been  identified  through  genome-wide  as-
sociation  studies  (GWASs)  (The  WTCCC,  2007;  Estivill 
and  Armengol,  2007;  Hong  et al.,  2009;  Cho  et al., 
2009).  Although  some  CNV  studies  have  also  reported 
associations  with  several  complex  disorders,  the  corre-
sponding  CNV  data  are  scarce  compared  with  SNP 
data.  Moreover,  previous  GWASs  reported  associations 
of  SNPs  with  anthropometric  traits  including  blood  pres-
sure  (BP)  and  body  mass  index  (BMI)  in  the  Korean 
population  (Hong et al.,  2009;  Cho et al.,  2009),  but  no 
CNV  association  studies  with  these  traits  have  been 
reported.
    The  aims  of  our  current  study  were  as  follows:  1)  dis-
cover  Korean  CNV  regions  (CNVRs)  in  large-scale  cohort 
samples;  2)  examine  additional  loci  that  may  be  asso-
ciated  with  hypertension-related  traits;  3)  compare  asso-
ciation  results  of  CNVs  with  those  of  previously  known 
risk  loci.  Toward  these  goals,  we  performed  a  three- 
stage  analysis.  In  the  first  stage,  we  conducted  a  ge-
nome-wide  survey  of  CNVs  in  3,274  healthy  Korean  par-
ticipants  as  part  of  the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiology 
Study  (KoGES)  using  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Hu-
man  SNP  Array  6.0  platform.  Using  stringent  quality 
control,  we  ascertained  2,206  CNVRs.  In  the  second 
stage,  we  carried  out  a  logistic  regression  analysis  of 
CNVs  with  two  hypertension-related  traits,  BP  and  BMI. 

Of  the  3,274  participants  in  this  study,  1,725  (602  cas-
es,  1,123  controls)  were  selected  for  association  analy-
sis  with  BP;  for  BMI,  3,212  participants  (1,112  cases, 
2,100  controls)  were  similarly  selected.  In  the  third  sta-
ge,  of  the  4,692  participants  genotyped  with  the  Affy-
metrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  platform  in 
an  independent  cohort,  we  selected  3,507  (1,561  cases, 
1,946  controls)  and  4,592  (2,095  cases,  2,497  controls) 
participants  for  inclusion  in  the  respective  replication 
analysis  datasets  for  these  two  CNVRs.
    In  conclusion,  our  result  is  consistent  with  that  of  the 
Wellcome  Trust  Case  Control  Consortium  (WTCCC)  CNV 
study  (2010).  Thus,  our  result  confirmed  the  conclusion 
of  WTCCC  CNV  study  suggesting  weak  association  with 
complex  traits.  Although  we  also  found  no  Asian-specif-
ic  CNVs  associated  with  hypertension-related  traits,  our 
study  is  the  first  to  examine  the  contribution  of  CNVs  to 
common  complex  diseases  in  a  Korean  population  and 
will  provide  new  insight  into  the  genetics  associated 
with  complex  traits  having  underlying  CNVs  in  the  Kore-
an  population.

Methods

Study  participants

Study  participants  were  enrolled  from  a  population- 
based  cohort  called  the  Health  Examinee  (HEXA)  cohort, 
which  is  a  part  of  KoGES.  DNA  was  extracted  from  pe-
ripheral  blood  with  informed  consent.  Through  each  step 
of  SNP  quality  control  procedures  (sample  call  rate  ≥
95%,  gender  inconsistency  check,  exclusion  of  cancer 
patients,  population  stratification  check,  etc.),  the  3,703 
healthy  individuals  (aged  between  40  and  70  years) 
were  genotyped  on  the  Affymetrix  Human  Genome-Wide 
SNP  array  6.0.  This  dataset  was  composed  of  44.6% 
male  and  55.4%  female  samples.  Files  with  raw  signal 
intensity  (CEL  files)  from  the  3,703  samples  were  con-
verted  to  normalized  log  R  intensity  ratios.

CNV  detection  stage

Pooled  reference
For  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  6.0, 
pre-processing  procedures 
(background  subtraction, 
normalization,  summarization  of  probe  set)  were  per-
formed  with  the  apt-probeset-summarize  application  (Af-
fymetrix  Power  Tools;  http://www.affymetrix.com/part-
ners_programs/programs/developer/tools/powertools. 
affx).  After  pre-processing  procedures,  the  signal  in-
tensity  ratio  between  the  test  and  the  reference  sample 
of  each  probe  was  transformed  to  log2  scale  with  the 
chromosomal  coordinate  of  the  probes  (UCSC  version 

CNV  Association  with  Hypertension-related  Traits 153

hg18/  NCBI  Build  36).  The  technical  artifact,  spatial  au-
tocorrelation  or  ‘wave’,  which  occurs  in  a  large  dataset 
used  to  determine  the  location  of  CNV  across  the  ge-
nome,  were  removed  by  WaveNorm  software  (Marioni et 
al.,  2007).
    DNA  from  a  single  individual  such  as  NA10851  or 
NA15510  was  used  for  CNV  discovery  in  some  reported 
CNV  analyses  (Redon et al.,  2006;  Komura et al.,  2006; 
Olsen  and  Venkatraman,  2004).  However,  the  probability 
that  the  reference  CNV  region  was  homozygously  de-
leted  may  lead  to  detection  of  false-positive  CNVs 
(Marioni et al.,  2007;  Komura et al.,  2006).  Therefore,  we 
assumed  that  the  reference  effect  of  a  homozygously 
deleted  CNV  region  could  be  minimized  by  using  the 
pooled  reference  signal  intensity.  Finally,  we  used  the 
average  intensity  of  100  samples  that  were  randomly 
selected  from  among  3,703  cohort  participants  rather 
than  a  single  individual’s  intensity  (Fig.  1). 

CNV  detection
To  increase  the  robustness  of  CNV  detection,  two  differ-
ent  algorithms,  DNAcopy  (Olsen  and  Venkatraman,  2004) 
and  the  Genome  Alteration  Detection  Analysis  (GADA) 
(Pique-Regi et al.,  2008),  were  used.  To  define  the  thre-
shold,  different  threshold  Ts  were  tested  from  3  to  4.5. 
Finally,  we  ran  DNAcopy  by  default  and  the  GADA  R- 
package  with  T=4.5,  α=0.2,  and  MinSegLen=6  on  the 
3,603  individuals  (excluding  100  samples  for  pooled  ref-
erence).  In  addition,  the  average  log2  ratio  for  defining 
CNV  segments  was  set  to±0.3.  Eventually,  we  chose 
3,274  samples  with  both  a  median  of  the  absolute  value 
of  all  pairwise  differences  (MAPD)  of  ＜0.3  and  the 
number  of  CNV  segments  within  the  outlier  detection 

limits  (Q1−1.5×IQR∼Q3+1.5×IQR)  (see  supplementary 

methods:  participant  pruning;  supplementary  Fig.  S2). 
After  subsequent  stringent  quality-control  processes, 
2,206  CNVRs  were  used  for  further  studies  (see  supple-
mentary  methods:  CNV  segment  selection  and  CNVR; 
supplementary  Fig.  S1;  supplementary  Fig.  S3).

Disease  association  stage 
The  basic  characteristics  of  the  participants  are  listed  in 
Table  1.  In  this  study,  systolic  blood  pressure  (SBP)  and 
diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP)  were  taken  from  the 
averages  of  three  recumbent  measurements.  The  602 
cases  were  defined  as  having  SBP≥140  mmHg  or  DBP 
≥90  mmHg.  The  1,123  controls  were  defined  as  having 
SBP＜120  mmHg  and  DBP＜80  mmHg.  Average  SBP 
and  DBP  of  study  participants  were  119.15±18.25  and 
75.85±12.70  mmHg,  respectively  (Table  1).  In  addition, 
we  defined  BMI  as  the  individual’s  weight  in  kilograms 
divided  by  the  height  in  meters  squared,  according  to 
the  World  Health  Organization  BMI  thresholds.  The

Fig.  1.  Overall  scheme  for  CNV  detection.  The  average  intensity  of  100  samples  was  used  for  the  reference  signal  intensity
rather  than  that  of  the  single  individual.  To  exclude  erroneous  CNV  signals,  we  applied  a  stringent  rule  from  singletons  to 
tripletons.  All  detected  singletons  were  discarded.  For  doubletons  and  tripletons,  overlapping  regions  were  considered  a 
CNVR  only  if  ＞90%  of  the  CNV  segment  of  each  individual  reciprocally  overlapped  with  each  other  (see  supplementary  Fig. 
S3).  For  CNV  segments  occurring  in  more  than  four  individuals,  CNV  segments  with  any  sized  overlapping  region  were  con-
sidered  a  CNVR.

was  24.08±2.76  (Table  1).  For  the  regression  analysis, 
copy  number  deletion,  normal  and  duplication  were  en-

coded  to  −1,  0  and  +1,  respectively.  Logistic  re-

gression  analyses  were  conducted  by  SAS  software, 
and  all  models  were  adjusted  for  gender  and  age.

Replication  stage
Two  positive  CNV  loci  were  evaluated  in  an  independent 
cohort.  For  replication  analysis,  we  used  4,692  partic-
ipants  from  the  Ansung-Ansan  cohort,  which  is  also  a 
part  of  KoGES.  These  participants  were  genotyped  with 
the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  Array  5.0  and

average  and  median  length  of  all  CNVRs  was  72.1  kb 
and  23.0  kb,  respectively  (see  supplementary  Table  1). 
Moreover,  an  average  of  44.5  CNV  segments  was  found 
in  each  individual  (see  supplementary  Fig.  S5).

Results

Characteristics  of  CNVs  and  CNVRs

As  mentioned  above,  145,689  of  163,829  CNV  segments 
were  selected  for  further  study.  These  segments  con-
sisted  of  53,817  gains  and  91,872  losses.  Finally,  2,206 
CNVRs  were  defined  from  among  these  CNV  segments. 
Of  these  CNVRs,  69.2%  (1,527  of  2,206)  overlapped  by 
≥1  bp  with  14,411  CNVRs  in  the  Database  of  Genomic 
Variants  (DGVs;  http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/).  Con-
versely,  10.7%  (1,538  of  15,411)  of  CNVRs  in  DGV  mat-

Frequency  analysis

We  examined  the  distribution  of  the  2,206  CNVRs  by 
frequency  of  occurrence.  Fig.  2A  and  Fig.  2B  show  the 
distribution  of  CNVRs  with  a  frequency  of  more  than  1% 
and  less  than  1%,  respectively.  Among  the  CNVRs  with 
a  frequency  of  ＞1%,  most  of  the  detected  CNVRs  had 
a  frequency  of  1∼5%  (Fig.  2A).  On  the  other  hand,  be-
cause  we  excluded  all  singleton  CNV  segments  as  well 
as  some  of  the  doubletons  and  tripletons  according  to 
the  stringent  rule  (see  supplementary  methods:  CNV  re-
gion),  most  CNVRs  with  a  frequency  of  ＜1%  were  in-
cluded  in  a  frequency  range  of  0.1∼0.5%  (Fig.  2B).  The

number  of  CNVRs  with  a  frequency  of  ＜1%  was  ap-
proximately  four  times  as  many  as  the  number  with  a 
frequency  of  ＞1%  (Fig.  2C).

Gene  ontology  analysis

We  surveyed  RefSeq  genes  partially  or  entirely  harbor-
ing  2,206  CNVRs  and  found  1,556  genes.  The  PAN-
THER  classification  system  (Thomas  et al.,  2003)  was 
used  to  assess  the  functional  implications  of  these 
CNVRs.  PANTHER  results  showed  genes  involved  in 
metabolic  processes,  cellular  processes  and  communi-
cation,  immune  system  processes,  etc  (see  supple-
mentary  Table  2).

Disease  association  and  replication  study

We  tested  the  association  between  CNVs  and  two  kinds 
of  applicable  anthropometry  traits,  BP  and  BMI.  In  all, 

14  CNVRs  that  overlapped  by  ≥1  bp  with  18  genes 
were  significantly  associated  with  BP  and  hypertension 
with  p-value＜0.05.  Regarding  an  association  between 
BMI  and  CNV,  14  CNVRs  that  overlapped  by  ≥1  bp 
with  13  genes  showed  association,  with  p-value＜0.05 
(Table  2).  To  compare  all  31  genes  with  previously  re-
ported  genetic  associations,  we  used  Genopedia  in 
HuGE  Navigator  (Yu  et al.,  2008).  Two  CNVRs  encom-
passing  known  hypertension-related  genes,  LPA  and 
JAK2,  were  observed  with  suggestive  p-values  (0.0334 
for  LPA  and  0.0305  for  JAK2).  CNV  loci  overlapping 
LPA  were  registered  in  DGV.  These  two  CNVRs  were 
selected  for  further  replication  studies.
    For  the  replication  stage,  CNV  loci  overlapping  LPA 
and  JAK2  were  observed  with  non-significant  p-values 
of  0.8687  (odds  ratio:  1.041,  95%  confidence  interval: 
0.644∼1.684)  and  0.2782  (odds  ratio:  0.775,  95%  con-
fidence  interval:  0.489∼1.229),  respectively  (Fig.  3).

Discussion

Hypertension  refers  to  a  clinically  significant  increase  in 
BP,  and  it  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  cardiovascular 
disease;  further,  excess  body  weight  is  a  major  risk  fac-
tor  for  hypertension  (The  WTCCC,  2007).  Development 
of  hypertension,  however,  hypertension  has  a  multi-
factorial  etiology,  including  both  genetic  and  environ-
mental  factors.  Therefore,  the  distinctive  causes  and 
factors  of  hypertension  are  still  not  fully  understood.
    In  this  study,  we  found  that  two  CNVRs  overlapped 
with  previously  known  risk  loci,  namely  LPA  on  6q26 
and JAK2  on  9p24.  Some  association  studies  have  been 
reported  regarding  these  loci.  For  example,  common 
variants  in LPA  are  associated  with  myocardial  infarction 
(Deo et al.,  2011).  In  particular,  higher  copy  numbers  of 
the  kringle  (IV)  domain  in  this  protein  are  associated 
with  lower  lipoprotein  levels  (van  der  Hoek et al.,  1993). 
Moreover,  Wong et al.  (2007)  conducted  a  CNV  analysis 
using  a  whole-genome  array  comparative  genomic  hy-
bridization  (aCGH).  Among  the  detected  CNVs,  they 
found  CNV  loci  overlapping LPA.  Association  of  BP  with 
JAK2  has  also  been  reported.  Guilluy  et al.  (2010) 
showed  that  inhibition  of  JAK2  prevents  angiotensin 
II-mediated  hypertension  in  wild-type  mice. 
    In  contrast  with  the  results  of  the  association  stage, 
the  two  positive  findings  were  not  confirmed  in  the  repli-
cation  stage.  CNV  loci  overlapping LPA  and JAK2  were 
observed  with  nonsignificant  p-values.  In  the  association 
stage,  other  well-established  risk  loci  such  as ATP2B1, 
FTO, MC4R, PPYR1, ST7L-CAPZA1, FIGN-GRB14, EN-
PEP, NPR3,  and  TBX3  that  were  observed  in  previous 
GWAS  or  CNV  studies  (Sha  et al.,  2009;  Levy  et al., 
2009;  Newton-Cheh  et al.,  2009;  Kato  et al.,  2011; 
Frayling et al.,  2007;  Loos et al.,  2008;  Glessner et al., 

2010;  Dorajoo  et al.,  2011)  were  not  observed  in  our 
current  study.  There  are  some  potential  reasons  for  why 
these  loci  were  not  significantly  observed  in  our  study. 
First,  risk  loci  affecting  hypertension  may  differ  when 
studying  CNVs  and  SNPs.  Alternatively,  rare  CNV  var-
iants  may  affect  the  etiology  of  hypertension,  or  hyper-
tension  may  have  few  common  risk  alleles  that  each 
has  a  relatively  large  effect.  Finally,  some  of  the  controls 
may  have  been  misclassified  as  cases  owing  to  limi-
tations  of  current  CNV  genotyping  technology.
    Similar 
results  supporting  our  study  have  been 
reported.  The  WTCCC  performed  an  association  study 
of  common  CNVs  with  eight  common  diseases  including 
hypertension  using  the  original  WTCCC  study  samples 
(WTCCC,  2010)  and  identified  three  CNV  loci  that  were 
associated  with  common  diseases.  They  concluded, 
however,  that  none  of  the  three  loci  was  believed  to  be 
a  functional  variant  and  that  common  CNVs  may  not 
play  a  major  role  in  the  genetic  basis  of  common  dis-
eases  (WTCCC,  2010).  Similar  to  the  conclusion  of 
WTCCC,  few  association  studies  of  complex  diseases 
with  CNVs  as  newly  discovered  genetic  markers  have 
been  reported.  For  example,  Charchar et al.  (2010)  con-
ducted  a  genome-wide  survey  of  CNVs  in  the  sponta-
neously  hypertensive  rat;  they  identified  and  validated 
16  CNVs  associated  with  the  spontaneously  hyper-
tensive  phenotype.  In  contrast  with  the  association  in 
the  spontaneously  hypertensive  rat,  Johnson  et  al. 
(2009)  found  no  association  of  CNVs  in  BMPR2  with 
pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  in  human.  Our  data  are 
consistent  with  those  of  the  WTCCC  CNV  study,  which 
suggests  that  functional  variants  and  common  CNVs 
may  not  play  a  major  role  in  the  genetic  basis  of  com-
mon  diseases  (WTCCC,  2010).
    Moreover,  the  absence  of  a  positive  result  in  the  rep-

158 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  9(4)  152-160,  December  2011

lication  stage  of  our  study  may  be  due  to  the  frequency 
of  occurrence.  That  is,  because  recurrence  rates  of  un-
common  (or  less  common)  CNV  loci  with  frequencies  of 
1∼5%  may  vary  between  populations,  our  two  positive 
findings  (2.9%  for LPA  and  1.9%  for JAK2)  may  not  be 
replicated  in  the  association  stage.  Alternatively,  similar 
to  the  association  stage,  the  limitation  of  platform  reso-
lution  may  lead  to  replication  failure.  Consequently,  to 
resolve  obstacles  underlying  a  CNV  association  study 
such  as  the  complexity  of  the  genetic  architecture  for 
hypertension  and  the  limitation  of  the  current  CNV  gen-
otyping  techniques,  a  more  comprehensive  study  with  a 
higher-resolution  platform  will  be  necessary  to  identify 
genetic  variants  that  affect  hypertension.  There  are 
some  limitations  associated  with  our  approach.  As  we 
used  the  Affymetrix  5.0  for  the  replication  stage,  we 
could  not  address  whether  two  signals  were  not  re-
plicated  or  were  false  positive  signals.  Therefore,  vali-
dation  experiment  such  as  quantitative  PCR  (qPCR)  is 
needed  for  the  accurate  analysis.
    In  conclusion,  our  result  is  consistent  with  that  of  the 
WTCCC  CNV  study.  Thus,  our  study  confirmed  the  con-
clusion  of  WTCCC  CNV  study  suggesting  no  association 
with  complex  traits.  In  addition,  this  is  the  first  CNV  as-
sociation  to  examine  the  contribution  of  CNVs  to  hyper-
tension  in  a  Korean  population.  Therefore,  our  study  will 
also  provide  new  insight  into  the  genetics  associated 
with  complex  traits  having  CNVs  in  the  Korean  po-
pulation.
