Abstract

The  target  of  rapamycin  (TOR)  signaling  pathway  is  a 
conserved  pathway  that  regulates  eukaryotic  cell  growth 
in  response  to  environmental  cues.  Chemical  genomic 
approaches  that  profile  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  yeast 
deletion  strains  have  given  insights  into  the  function  of 
TOR  signaling  pathway.  In  the  present  study,  we  ana-
lyzed  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  yeast  deletion  library 
strains  on  synthetic  medium.  As  a  result,  we  identified 
130  strains  that  are  hypersensitive  or  resistant  to  rapa-
mycin  compared  with  wild-type  cells.  Among  them,  36 
genes  are  newly  identified  to  be  related  to  rapamycin 
sensitivity.  Moreover,  we  found  16  strains  that  show  al-
teration  in  rapamycin  sensitivity  between  complex  and 
synthetic  media.  We  suggest  that  these  genes  may  be 
involved  in  part  of  TOR  signaling  activities  that  is  differ-
entially  regulated  by  media  composition.

Introduction

The  target  of  rapamycin  (TOR)  kinase  is  structurally  and 
functionally  conserved  in  eukaryotic  organisms  from 
yeast  to  human.  In  yeast,  there  are  two  TOR  proteins, 
Tor1  and  Tor2,  which  function  in  two  distinct  TOR  com-
plexes,  named  TOR  complex  1  (TORC1)  and  TOR  com-
plex  2  (TORC2).  TORC1  contains  either  Tor1  or  Tor2  as 
one  of  its  subunits,  whereas  TORC2  contains  only  Tor2, 
but  not  Tor1  (Loewith  et al.,  2002).  TORC1  positively 
controls  cell  growth  in  response  to  nutrient  availability. 
It  stimulates  anabolic  processes  like  protein  synthesis

inhibits  catabolic  processes 

and 
like  autophagy 
(Kamada et al.,  2004;  Mayer  and  Grummt,  2006;  Rohde 
et al.,  2001).  Rapamycin,  a  macrolide  antibiotic,  is  a 
specific  inhibitor  of  TORC1.  Internalized  rapamycin  binds 
to  Fpr1,  and  rapamycin-Fpr1  complex  can  bind  to  TOR 
protein  only  in  TORC1  (Heitman  et al.,  1991;  Koltin  et 
al.,  1991;  Loewith  et al.,  2002).  Because  rapamycin 
treatment  can  easily  induce  some  physiological  charac-
teristics  that  come  from  TORC1  inhibition,  rapamycin 
treatment  is  broadly  used  to  identify  function  of  TORC1. 
The  function  of  mammalian  TORC1  is  similar  to  yeast 
TORC1  and  inhibition  pathway  by  rapamycin-FKBP  is 
also  well  conserved  (Hara et al.,  2002;  Kim et al.,  2002).
    Yeast  deletion  library  created  by  the Saccharomyces 
Genome  Deletion  Project  (Giaever et al.,  2002;  Winzeler 
et al.,  1999)  is  composed  of  4,847  MATa  deletion 
strains  that  were  generated  by  replacing  each  open 
reading  frame  with  a  kanamycin  resistance  marker, 
KanMX4.  Gene  disruption  is  a  fundamental  approach  to 
understand  the 
function  of  a  gene.  By  observing 
changes  in  phenotypes  or  responses  to  specific  stim-
ulus,  we  can  infer  the  function  of  the  gene.  Yeast  dele-
tion  library  enabled  systematic  analyses  to  investigate 
various  cellular  responses  such  as  tolerance  of  ex-
tracellular  stimulus,  sensitivity  to  drug,  and  longevity 
(Abe  and  Minegishi,  2008;  Chan et al.,  2000;  Kaeberlein 
et al.,  2005;  Xie  et al.,  2005).
    Investigation  into  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  mutants 
has  given  insights  into  the  mechanism  of  TOR  signaling 
pathway.  The  first  discovery  of  TOR  protein  in  yeast 
came  from  isolation  of  rapamycin-resistant  mutants,  and 
various  TOR  signaling  effectors  were  identified  from  ra-
(Heitman  et  al.,  1991). 
pamycin  sensitivity  studies 
Previously,  two  groups  performed  high-throughput  rapa-
mycin  sensitivity  screening  using  yeast  deletion  library 
and  identified  total  464  genes  whose  deletions  confer 
the  alteration  of  sensitivity  to  rapamycin  (Chan  et al., 
2000;  Xie  et al.,  2005).
    Yeast  extract-peptone-dextrose  (YPD)  and  synthetic 
complete  (SC)  media  are  commonly  used  for  yeast  culti-
vation,  but  their  compositions  are  quite  different.  Recen-
tly,  it  was  reported  that  chronological  lifespan  in  yeast 
is  differentially  regulated  between  YPD  and  SC  media 
(Lastauskiene  and  Citavicius,  2008;  Weinberger  et al., 
2010).  Taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  activity  of 
TOR  signaling  pathway  is  dependent  on  nutrient  avail-
ability,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  media  composi-
tion  would  affect  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  cells.  While

present  study,  we  performed 
rapamycin  sensitivity 
screening  of  yeast  deletion  library  on  SC  medium  to  find 
novel  effectors  of  TOR  signaling  pathway.  We  found  130 
mutants  that  are  hypersensitive  or  resistant  to  rapamy-
cin  on  SC  media,  and  16  mutants  that  show  different 
sensitivity  between  YPD  and  SC  media.  We  suggest 
that  these  genes  may  be  involved  in  TOR  signaling 
pathway

Methods

Yeast  strains,  medium  and  reagents

4,847 MATa  strains  in  yeast  deletion  library  created  by 
the  Saccharomyces  Genome  Deletion  Project  (http:// 
www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/yeast_deletion_proj-
ect/deletions3.html)  were  used  to  profile  growth  rates  in 
response  to  rapamycin.  SC  medium  (0.67%  yeast  nitro-
gen  base  without  amino  acids,  2%  glucose,  and  appro-
priate  amino  acids)  and  YPD  medium  (1%  yeast  extract, 
2%  peptone,  and  2%  glucose)  were  prepared  as  pre-
viously  described  (Sherman,  2002).  Cells  were  grown  in 
30oC.  Rapamycin  (Tecoland)  was  dissolved  in  DMSO 
and  used  at  indicated  concentrations  (10  ng/ml,  100 
ng/ml,  and  200  ng/ml).

Rapamycin  sensitivity  screening 

Yeast  deletion  library  strains  were  incubated  in  YPD  for 
1  day  in  96-deep-well  plates  and  spotted  onto  SC  agar 
medium  containing  10  ng/ml  or  100  ng/ml  rapamycin  by 
using  a  96-pin  tool  (V&P  Scientific;  VP408B).  After  in-
cubation  for  4∼6  days,  rapamycin-resistant  or  -hyper-
sensitive  strains  were  selected  by  comparing  with  other 
colonies  in  the  same  plate.  Between  each  spotting, 
96-pin  tool  was  cleaned  by  10%  bleach,  distilled  water, 
and  flaming  with  ethanol.

Data analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) Slim 
Mapper  and  the  Search  Tool  for  the  Retrieval  of 
Interacting  Genes/Proteins  (STRING)

Selected  genes  were  categorized  by  biological  proc-
esses  using  the  GO  Slim  Mapper  available  at  the 
Saccharomyces  Genome  Database  (SGD;  www.yeastge-
nome.org).  Genes  mapped  to  “other  function”  or  “not 
yet  annotated”  were  eliminated  from  total  4,847  genes, 
and  the  remaining  2,757  gene  were  compared  with  our 
candidate  genes.  The  STRING  is  a  web-based  resource 
for  the  retrieval  of  gene/protein  interactions  and  is  avail-

in  YPD  for  1day  were  spotted  on  SC  agar  medium  contain-
ing  10  ng/mL  or  100  ng/mL  rapamycin.  Rapamycin-resistant 
or  -hypersensitive  strains  were  selected  after  incubation  at 
30oC  for  4~6  days.  (B)  Spotting  assay  was  performed  with 
53  rapamycin-resistant  mutants  and  95  rapamycin-hyper-

Results

Genomewide  screening  of  rapamycin  sensitivity 
on  SC  medium

We  measured  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  yeast  deletion 
library  strains  on  SC  medium  by  spotting  using  a  96-pin 
tool  (1  to  2μl  of  inoculum  per  pin).  Yeast  deletion  li-
brary  strains  were  inoculated  into  YPD  liquid  medium  in 
96-deep-well  plates  and  incubated  for  1  day.  These  fully 
grown  cells  were  spotted  using  a  96-pin  tool  onto  SC 
agar  medium  containing  10  ng/ml  or  100  ng/ml  rapa-
mycin.  We  selected  rapamycin-hypersensitive  strains 
from  SC  medium  containing  10  ng/ml  rapamycin,  and 
rapamycin-resistant  strains  from  SC  medium  containing 
100  ng/ml  rapamycin.  Although  we  could  not  exactly 
adjust  the  volume  of  each  inoculum,  most  of  colonies 
except  those  of  rapamycin-sensitive  strains  showed 
similar  size  on  medium  containing  10  ng/ml  rapamycin 
(Fig.  1A).  This  observation  indicates  that  the  slight  differ-
ence  in  the  amount  of  inoculated  cells  between  spots  is 
ignorable  in  this  screening.
    From  the first  screening,  113  rapamycin-resistant  strains 
and  113  rapamycin-hypersensitive  strains  were  isolated. 
To  compare  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  mutant  cells 
with  wild-type  cells  as  a  control  and  to  remove  the  var-
iation  between  plates,  we  collected  rapamycin-resistant 
or  -hypersensitive  strains,  and  performed  a  second 
screening  using  a  96-pin  tool.  From  the  second  screen-
ing,  we  selected  53  rapamycin-resistant  strains  and  95 
rapamycin-hypersensitive  strains.
    Next,  we  confirmed  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  these

deletion  mutants  by  spotting  assay.  Exponentially  grow-
ing  cells  (OD600=1.0)  in  YPD  medium  were  10-fold  seri-
ally  diluted  and  spotted  onto  SC  and  YPD  agar  plates 
containing  200  ng/mL  rapamycin  (Fig.  1B).  We  scored 
the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  cells  from  +++++  to  ----. 
Strains  that  got  the  score  of  0  or  +  were  ruled  out  be-
cause  their  rapamycin  sensitivity  was  not  significantly 
different  from  that  of  wild-type  cells.  As  done  previously, 
we  named  the  genes  whose  deletions  confer  rapamycin 
resistance  or  hypersensitivity  as  RR  or  RH  genes,  re-
spectively  (Chan  et al.,  2000).  Finally,  we  obtained  37 
RR  genes  and  93  RH  genes  (Fig.  1C),  which  are  listed 
in  Table  1.

Functional  analysis  of  RR  and  RH  genes

In  previous  high-throughput  studies,  Xie  et al.  (2005) 
identified  396  genes  that  are  related  to  rapamycin  sensi-
tivity,  and  Chan et al.  (2000)  identified  27  RR  genes  and 
89  RH  genes.  Comparison  of  these  results  with  our  data 
revealed  that  80  genes  (62%)  in  our  list  overlap  with 
those  from  previous  results  (Fig.  2A).  Among  the  remain-
ing  50  genes  in  our  data,  14  genes  have  been  shown 
to  be  related  to  rapamycin  sensitivity  by  other  previous 
studies  (Dudley et al.,  2005;  Fournier et al.,  2010;  Huber 
et al.,  2009;  Leidel  et al.,  2009;  Parsons  et al.,  2004; 
Snowdon  et al.,  2008;  Wu  et al.,  2000).  10  RR  genes 
and  26  RH  genes  that  were  newly  identified  by  our  ge-
nomewide  analysis  on  SC  medium  are  underlined  in 
Table  1.
    Using  the  GO  Slim  Mapper  tool  available  at  the  SGD, 
we  analyzed  the  enrichment  of  biological  processes  for 
109  RR  and  RH  genes  whose  functions  are  known. 
Notably,  we  found  that  translation-related  genes  occupy 
20%  of  RR  genes  (Fig.  2B).  This  observation  correlates

Fig.  2.  Analysis  of  RR  and  RH  genes  found  in  this  study.  (A)  Among  130  RR  and  RH  genes  that  we  found,  80  genes  over-
lapped  with  those  from  two  previous  high-throughput  screening  results.  (B)  The  enrichment  of  biological  processes  for  RR 
and  RH  genes  was  analyzed  using  the  GO  Slim  Mapper  tool  available  at  the  SGD.  2,757  genes  for  total  genes,  30  genes
for  RR  genes,  and  79  genes  for  RH  genes  were  analyzed.  (C)  An  interaction  map  between  130  RR  and  RH  genes  drawn
by  the  STRING.  Each  node  is  a  gene,  and  a  line  between  two  nodes  means  a  predicted  interaction.  The  thickness  of  a  line
represents  confidence  value  for  prediction.  11  most  interacting  hub  genes  are  shown  in  red  circle  and  listed  in  a  table.  A 
cluster  composed  of  MRP  genes  is  zoomed  in.

with  the  well-known  fact  that  TORC1  controls  cell 
growth  by  regulating  translation.  It  is  also  notable  that 
RNA  metabolic  process-related  genes  are  about  twice 
enriched  in  RH  genes.  This  result  suggests  that  RNA 
metabolism  may  be  closely  related  to  TOR  signaling 
pathway.  However,  the  relationship  between  RNA  me-
tabolism  and  TOR  signaling  pathway  is  not  clearly  de-

fined  yet.
    In  addition,  we  generated  an  interaction  map  of  130 
RR  or  RH  genes  using  the  STRING  and  found  11  inter-
action  hubs  that  have  more  than  9  interactions  (Fig.  2C). 
Notably,  these  hubs  included  the  URE2,  SIT4,  GLN3, 
and RRD1  genes  that  are  known  to  play  important  roles 
in  TOR  signaling  pathway 
(Beck  and  Hall,  1999; 

Genomewide  Profiling  of  Rapamycin  Sensitivity    181

Fig.  3.  Altered  rapamycin  sensitivity  between  YPD  and  SC  media.  45  strains  that  showed  significant  resistance  or  hyper-
sensitivity  to  rapamycin  in  other  previous  studies  but  were  not  included  in  the  rapamycin-responsive  candidates  identified 
from  our  screening  were  spotted  onto  SC  (left  panel)  and  YPD  medium  containing  100  ng/mL  rapamycin  (right  panel).

Carvalho  and  Zheng,  2003;  Rohde et al.,  2004).  This  ob-
servation  raises  a  possibility  that  other  hub  genes  may 
also  be  closely  related  to  TOR  signaling  pathway. 
Among  the  hub  genes, ARP8,  a  component  of  chroma-
tin-remodeling  complexes,  showed  interactions  with  the 
most  genes  within  130  genes.  The  relationship  between 
ARP8  and  TOR  signaling  pathway  is  not  identified  yet. 
Yeast  has  about  60  mitochondrial  ribosomal  proteins 
(MRPs).  We  also  noticed  a  cluster  in  the  interaction  map 
which  is  mainly  composed  of  five  MRP  genes-MRP7, 
MRPL10,  MRPL36,  MRPL6,  and  MRPS5.  Alteration  in 
the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  these  MRP  gene  mutants 
has  not  been  reported  before,  except  for MRP7.  This  re-
sult  suggests  that  proteins  involved  in  mitochondrial 
function  are  highly  likely  to  be  related  to  SC-specific  al-
teration  in  the  rapamycin  sensitivity  of  cells.

    Identification  of  strains  showing  difference  in 
rapamycin  sensitivity  between  YPD  and  SC  me-
dia

    Next,  we  tested  whether  rapamycin  sensitivity  could 
be  influenced  by  media  composition.  We  spotted  130 
RH  and  RR  strains  not  only  on  SC  medium  but  also  on 
YPD  medium,  and  compared  the  growth  of  strains  be-
tween  two  media.  We  found  that  25  strains  did  not  re-
spond  to  rapamycin  in  YPD,  and  among  them  14  genes 
(RTG1,  YPL105C,  SIT4,  ARP8,  DPH2,  RTT103,  YIA6, 
AIM22,  FYV4,  HTD2,  HIT1,  NUP84,  YBL100C,  and 
ETR1)  were  included  in  RR  and  RH  genes  newly  identi-
fied  from  our  assay.  Sit4  is  a  well-known  effector  of 
TOR  signaling  pathway.  When  TORC1  is  inhibited  by  ra-
pamycin,  dephosphorylated  Tap42  is  released  from 

Rrd1/Sit4  complex,  and  then  activated  Sit4  functions  in 
regulatory  roles  in  the  inactive  TOR  pathway  (Di  Como 
and  Arndt,  1996;  Rohde et al.,  2004).  Deletion  of RRD1 
encoding  a  coactivator  of  Sit4  phosphatase  confers  sig-
nificant  increase  in  rapamycin  resistance.  However,  it 
has  not  been  reported  yet  whether sit4Δ mutant  shows 
altered  fitness  response  to  rapamycin.  Our  finding  that 
sit4Δ mutant  is  resistant  to  rapamycin  on  SC  medium 
is  consistent  with  the  known  function  of  Sit4  in  TOR  sig-
naling  pathway,  and  demonstrates  the  effectiveness  of 
rapamycin  sensitivity  screening  using  SC  medium.
    Since  media  composition  can  affect  the  rapamycin 
sensitivity  of  cells  as  shown  above,  it  is  also  con-
ceivable  that  strains  that  show  altered  rapamycin  sensi-
tivity  in  YPD  medium  but  not  in  SC  medium  may  exist. 
From  previous  results  by  other  studies,  we  chose  45 
strains  that  showed  significant  resistance  or  hyper-
sensitivity  to  rapamycin  but  were  not  included  in  the  ra-
pamycin-responsive  candidates 
from  our 
screening.  Interestingly,  two  strains  showed  opposite 
sensitivity  to  rapamycin  between  YPD  and  SC  media 
(Fig.  3). ssd1Δ mutant  was  hypersensitive  to  rapamycin 
on  YPD  medium,  but  showed  resistance  to  rapamycin 
on  SC  medium.  On  the  contrary, atp1Δ mutant  was  re-
sistant  to  rapamycin  on  YPD  medium,  but  hyper-
sensitive  to  rapamycin  on  SC  medium.  Ssd1  is  a  protein 
that  functions  in  the  maintenance  of  cellular  integrity, 
and  Atp1  is  a  subunit  of  mitochondrial  ATP  synthase 
(Kaeberlein  and  Guarente,  2002;  Takeda  et al.,  1986). 
Together,  we  found  16  strains  (rtg1Δ, ypl105cΔ, sit4Δ, 
arp8Δ, dph2Δ, rtt103Δ, yia6Δ, aim22Δ, fyv4Δ, htd2Δ, 
hit1Δ, nup84Δ, ybl100cΔ, etr1Δ, ssd1Δ,  and  atp1Δ) 
that  exhibited  different  rapamycin  sensitivity  between

YPD  and  SC  media.  This  result  suggests  that  some 
pathways  in  downstream  or  upstream  of  TORC1  are  dif-
ferentially  regulated  by  YPD  and  SC  media.
    Although  there  was  no  common  function  of  16  pro-
teins  whose  deficiency  causes  different  rapamycin  sen-
sitivity  between  YPD  and  SC  media,  7  proteins  (Fum1, 
Yia6,  Aim22,  Fyv4,  Htd2,  Etr1,  and  Atp1)  are  localized 
to  the  mitochondria,  and  one  of  the  remaining  proteins 
(Rtg1)  plays  a  role  in  retrograde  signaling  that  transmits 
changes  in  mitochondrial  function  to  nuclear  gene  ex-
pression  (Huh et al.,  2003;  Liu  and  Butow,  2006).  High 
enrichment  of  mitochondria-related  genes 
in  genes 
whose  deficiency  causes  different  rapamycin  sensitivity 
between  YPD  and  SC  media  suggests  that  mitochon-
drial  function  may  be  involved  in  part  of  TOR  signaling 
activities  that  is  differentially  regulated  by  media  compo-
sition.

Discussion

Altered  fitness  response  to  rapamycin  of  a  gene  deletion 
strain  implies  that  the  deleted  gene  is  possibly  related 
to  TOR  signaling  pathway.  Sometimes  it  gives  a  clue  to 
how  the  gene  functions  in  TORC1  signaling.  In  the  pres-
ent  study,  we  performed  a  genomewide  rapamycin  sen-
sitivity  analysis  on  4,847  strains  in  yeast  deletion  library. 
Through  this  screening,  we  identified  130  strains  exhibit-
ing  altered  rapamycin  sensitivity  phenotype.  During  the 
screening  work,  we  could  confirm  the  usefulness  of  a 
96-pin  tool  in  fitness  response  analysis.  A  high-density 
cell  arrayer  that  can  print  9,600  strains  at  once  was 
used  for  rapamycin  sensitivity  screening  in  other  studies. 
However,  by  using  a  96-pin  tool,  we  could  retain  the 
original  array  of  yeast  deletion  library  that  is  stored  in 
a  96-well  format,  and  identify  the  size  of  each  colony. 
Several  well-known  TORC1  singling  effectors,  such  as 
Gln3,  Ure2,  Npr1,  and  Tip41,  were  used  to  support  the 
reliability  of  rapamycin  sensitivity  screening  result  in  the 
previous  study  (Xie  et al.,  2005).  We  could  also  find 
these  genes  in  our  first  screening,  which  supports  the 
reliability  of  our  screening  result. 
    Importantly,  we  found  that  rapamycin  sensitivity  can 
be  altered  by  media  composition  in  some  gene  deletion 
strains.  Among  130  RH  and  RR  strains  identified  in  our 
study,  25  mutant  strains  exhibited  altered  rapamycin 
sensitivity  only  in  SC  medium.  We  also  found  two  mu-
tant  strains  that  show  opposite  rapamycin  sensitivity  be-
tween  YPD  and  SC  media.  Genes  deleted  in  these 
strains  are  supposed  to  be  related  to  part  of  TORC1  ac-
tivity  that  is  differentially  regulated  by  media  composi-
tion.  Further  investigation  into  the  relationship  between 
these  genes  and  TORC1  activity  will  provide  deeper  un-
derstanding  of  the  operational  mechanism  of  TOR  sig-

naling  pathway.
