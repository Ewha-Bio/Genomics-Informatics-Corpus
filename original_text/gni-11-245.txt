A radioresistant cell line was established by fractionated ionizing radiation (IR) and assessed by a clonogenic assay, flow 
cytometry, and Western blot analysis, as well as zymography and a wound healing assay. Microarray was performed to profile 
global  expression  and  to  search  for  differentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  in  response  to  IR.  H460R  cells  demonstrated 
increased cell scattering and acidic vesicular organelles compared with parental cells. Concomitantly, H460R cells showed 
characteristics of increased migration and matrix metalloproteinase activity. In addition, H460R cells were resistant to IR, 
exhibiting reduced expression levels of ionizing responsive proteins (p-p53 and γ-H2AX); apoptosis-related molecules, such 
as cleaved poly(ADP ribose) polymerase; and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related molecules, such as glucose-regulated 
protein (GRP78) and C/EBP-homologous protein compared with parental cells, whereas the expression of anti-apoptotic 
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein was increased. Among DEGs, syntrophin beta 2 (SNTB2) significantly increased in 
H460R cells in response to IR. Knockdown of SNTB2 by siRNA was more sensitive than the control after IR exposure in H460, 
H460R,  and  H1299  cells.  Our  study  suggests  that  H460R  cells  have  differential  properties,  including  cell  morphology, 
potential for metastasis, and resistance to IR, compared with parental cells. In addition, SNTB2 may play an important role in 
radioresistance. H460R cells could be helpful in in vitro systems for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of and discovering 
drugs to overcome radioresistance in lung cancer therapy.

Introduction

Lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer-related 
death in men and women, is responsible for 1.38 million 
deaths  annually,  as  of  2008  [1].  The  main  types  of  lung 
cancer are small-cell lung cancer (approximately 19%) and 
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; around 80%). Although 
NSCLC  is  sometimes  treated  with surgery,  advanced  and 
metastatic NSCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy 
and  radiotherapy  (RT)  [2].  RT,  either  alone  or  in  combi-
nation with surgery or chemotherapy, plays a major part in 
NSCLC  management.  Tumor  radioresistance  may  greatly 
reduce the efficiency of RT for NSCLC [3]. RT of a primary 
tumor  accelerates  metastatic  growth  in  mice  [4].  These 

invasive and metastatic mechanisms are associated with the 
recruitment of complex and numerous classes of proteins, 
including cadherins. Specifically, matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) play a key role in the degradation of extracellular 
matrix (ECM) proteins. Augmented MMP expression and its 
activity are associated with advanced tumor stage and poor 
survival. Elevated plasma levels of MMP-9 have been found 
in lung, breast, and liver cancers during RT [5, 6]. In addi-
tion, MMP-9 from sublethally irradiated tumors promotes 
Lewis  lung  carcinoma  cell  invasiveness  and  pulmonary 
metastasis  [7].  Recently,  MMP  inhibitors  were  shown  to 
block radiation-induced invasiveness of human pancreatic 
cancer cells [8]. In addition, expression of β-catenin plays 
a  pivotal  role  in  maintaining  the  integrity  of  cellular

functions [9]. 

Ionizing  radiation  (IR)-induced  double-strand  DNA 
breaks  ead  to  activation  of  ataxia  telangiectasia  mutated 
kinase  (ATM),  which  responds  through  autophosphory-
lation  and  activation  of  DNA  repair  pathways,  including 
phosphorylation  of  histone  H2AX  (γ-H2AX),  a  signal  for 
recruitment of molecular DNA repair complexes. In addition 
to a role in DNA damage repair, H2AX is required for DNA 
fragmentation during apoptosis and is phosphorylated by 
various  kinases  in  response  to  apoptotic  signals.  ATM 
stimulates  IR-induced  cycle  arrest  through  activation  of 
checkpoint kinases; p53; and cyclin-dependent kinase inhi-
bitors, such as p21 [10]. Moreover, poly(ADP ribose) poly-
merase (PARP), which is involved in DNA repair in response 
to  environmental  stress  [11],  helps  cells  maintain  their 
viability, and cleavage of PARP serves as a marker of cells 
undergoing  apoptosis  [12].  IR  also  induces  endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER) stress via upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94 
in rat intestinal epithelial cells [13]. The level of C/EBP- 
homologous protein (CHOP) expression is elevated during 
ER stress, and CHOP-deficient cells have enhanced survival 
when  challenged  with  toxins  that  induce  ER  stress,  sug-
gesting that CHOP functions to mediate programmed cell 
death [14]. 
Syntrophins are intracellular peripheral membrane pro-
teins of 58‒60 kD, originally identified as proteins enriched 
at  the  postsynaptic  apparatus  [15].  The  three  syntrophin 
isoforms, α1, β1, and β2, are encoded by different genes but 
have similar domain organizations [16]. Syntrophins consist 
of  a  C-terminal  syntrophin  unique  domain  and  an 
N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, split by insertion 
of a PDZ domain. Although syntrophins have been recog-
nized as an important component of many signaling events, 
such as insulin secretion, synapse signaling, and migration 
regulation [17-21], little is known about the involvement of 
syntrophin beta 2 (SNTB2) in radioresistance. 

In  the  present  study,  we  established  radioresistant 
NSCLC  H460R  cells.  We  tried  to  analyze  these  cells  in 
response to IR to identify SNTB2 among upregulated genes 
in radioresistant H460R cells and to provide new insights 
into the involvement of SNTB2 in radioresistance.

Methods
Cell culture

Human NSCLC cell lines (ATCC, Bethesda, MD) were 
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Welgene, 
Daegu, Korea), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, 
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), at 37oC under an 
atmosphere containing air and 5% CO2. Cell morphology 

was observed under an inverted light microscope.

Establishment of radiation-resistant H460R cells

H460 cells were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and 
irradiated with 2 Gy γ-rays using a Gammacell 3000 (Atomic 
Energy of Canada Ltd., Chalk River, ON, Canada) at a dose 
rate of 3.2 Gy/min when cells approached 60% confluence. 
When the cells reached about 90% confluence, they were 
subcultured into new culture dishes. The cells were treated 
again  with  2  Gy  γ-rays  at  about  60%  confluence.  These 
procedures were repeated over a period of 24 months. The 
parental  cells  were  cultured  under  the  same  conditions 
without ionizing irradiation.

Acridine orange staining

Acidic vesicular organelles were quantified by vital stai-
ning with Acridine Orange (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). 
Both the cytoplasm and nucleolus fluoresced bright green 
and dim red, whereas acidic compartments fluoresced bright 
red. The intensity of red fluorescence is proportional to the 
degree of acidity and/or the volume of the cellular acidic 
compartment [22]. Cells were stained with acridine orange 
and  analyzed  by  flow  cytometry  and  Cell  Quest  software 
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 

MTT assay and Trypan Blue staining

For the MTT assay, cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 
cells  per  well  on  96-well  plates,  and  3-(4,5-dimethyl-2- 
thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium  bromide  reagent 
(Sigma) was added to each well. After incubation for 4 h at 
37oC in an incubator under 5% CO2, dimethyl sulfoxide was 
added, and absorption was measured at a wavelength of 595 
nm.  Viable  cells  were  identified  based  on  their  ability  to 
exclude the dye via Trypan Blue (Invitrogen) staining.

Cell cycle analysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
measurement

Cells were fixed with 75% cold ethanol and stained with a 
solution containing propidium iodide and RNase A (Sigma). 
For  ROS  measurement,  cells  were  stained  with  5-(and- 
6)-carboxy-2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF- 
DA;  Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR,  USA),  and  the  fluo-
rescence of 10,000 cells was measured by flow cytometry.

Clonogenic assay

Colonies  were  fixed  in  methanol  and  stained  with  1% 
crystal violet. Colonies 1.0 mm in diameter were counted, 
and average colony numbers were multiplied by the dilution 
factor  of  the  cell  number.  Each  value  at  every  dose  was 
divided by the control value for the survival fraction.

Gelatin zymography

SNTB2 knockdown by siRNA

Conditioned media were separated with the use of 10% 
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) containing 0.2% gelatin. The gel was renatured 
with 2.5% Triton X-100 buffer for 1 h and incubated with 
developing solution (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM CaCl2) for 
18‒20  h  at  37oC.  The  gel  was  then  stained  with  0.5% 
Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) in 30% methanol and 10% 
glacial  acetic  acid  and  destained  with  the  same  solution 
without dye. 

Wound healing assay

Cells were seeded on a 24-well plate, and a wound was 
generated using a 200-μL tip; medium containing 10% FBS 
was added. Wound healing was observed under a microscope 
after 0, 16, 24, and 48 h. Images were captured and analyzed 
using  ImageJ  software  (National  Institutes  of  Health, 
Bethesda, MD, USA).

Western blot analysis

Cells were dissolved in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.1% 
SDS,  1%  sodium  deoxycholate,  1%  Triton  X-100,  2  mM 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 120 mM NaCl) containing 
phosphatase  and  protease  inhibitors.  After  quantification 
with Bradford assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), 
proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a 
polyvinylidene  difluoride  membrane  (Millipore,  Billerica, 
MA, USA), and probed with specific antibodies overnight at 
4oC.  Membranes  were  developed  using  a peroxidase-con-
jugated  secondary  antibody  and  visualized  by  chemilu-
minescence  with  enhanced  chemiluminescence  substrate 
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Microarray analysis

Parental and radioresistant cells were irradiated with 4 Gy 
γ-rays. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and microarray was 
performed  using  Affymetrix  GeneChip  human  genome 
U133 plus 2.0 arrays  (ITSTech, Seoul,  Korea). Data  were 
normalized via global scaling (GenPlex), and genes over the 
cutoff  of  2  were  selected  based  on  values  of  log2  (fold- 
change): upregulated genes with ‘p ＜ 0.05’ for detection 
value were selected in the H460R array, and downregulated 
genes with ‘p ＜ 0.05’ for detection value were selected in the 
H460 array (ITSTech and Macrogen, Seoul, Korea). Analysis 
of significant genes was performed by Welch’s t-test. Diffe-
rentially  expressed  genes (DEGs) were analyzed  between 
parental and radioresistant cells. Fold-change values in de-
scending order of 200 genes were selected from upregulated 
genes and downregulated genes. False discovery rate and 
Bonferroni-corrected p-values were calculated (Macrogen).

Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 
cells per well. After overnight culture, each well was trans-
fected  with  20‒40  nM  siRNA  using  Lipofectamine  2000 
transfection reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, 
the cells were treated with or without IR. The SNTB2 siRNA 
and negative control siRNA were as follows: SNTB2 (sense: 
5'-GUCUCUCUAGGCUGCAUGUdTdT-3',  antisense:  5'- 
ACAUGCAGCCUAGAGAGACdTdT-3')  and  negative  con-
trol  (sense:  5'-GAUCAUACGUGCGAUCAGAdTdT-3'  and 
antisense: 5'-UCUGAUCGCACGUAUGAUCdTdT-3').

Statistical analyses

Three independent experiments were performed, and the 
results  are  presented  as  the  mean  ±  standard  deviation. 
Statistical analyses of experimental data were determined 
using two-sided student’s t-test. p-values ＜ 0.05 were con-
sidered significant.

Results
Establishment and cellular morphology of H460R 
cells

Radioresistance  means  the  relative  resistance  of  cells, 
tissues, organs, or organisms to the injurious effects of IR. 
During the treatment period, recovery from radiation da-
mage between fractions has been shown to increase tumor 
resistance  against  fractionated  RT  [3].  Radioresistance  in 
vitro may be induced by exposure to small doses of IR [23]. 
To generate radiation-resistant cells, H460 cells were seeded 
in 100-mm culture dishes and irradiated with 2 Gy γ-rays at 
a  dose  rate  of  3.2  Gy/min  when  cells  approached  60% 
confluence. When the cells reached about 90% confluence, 
they were subcultured into new culture dishes. The cells 
were treated again with 2 Gy γ-rays at about 60% confluence. 
These procedures were repeated over a period of 24 mo. The 
parental  cells  were  cultured  under  the  same  conditions 
without  ionizing  irradiation.  These  cells  were  designated 
H460R and utilized in this study.

The parental H460 cells typically appeared cobblestone- 
like and showed tight cell-cell junctions, which is charac-
teristic of the epithelial phenotype. In contrast, H460R cells 
exhibited a spindle-like morphology and demonstrated a loss 
of cell-to-cell contact and an increase in cell scattering, as 
well as acidic vesicular organelles (Figs. 1A and 2A). Since a 
little difference in proliferative potential, such as cell cycle, 
has been reported between parental H460 and radioresistant 
H460R cells [23], we also examined whether established 
H460R cells are different from the parental H460 cells in cell 
proliferation,  cell  cycle,  and  ROS  levels  under  physio-

logically  normal  conditions.  Consistent  with  Lee  et  al.’s 
findings [23], no significant differences in cell proliferation, 
cell cycle, or ROS levels were observed between H460 and 
H460R cells under physiologically normal conditions (Fig. 
1B, 1C, and 1D).

in H460R cells

Since  spindle-like  morphology  and  an  increase  in  cell 
scattering  were  found  in  H460R  cells  (Fig.  1A),  a  small 
number of cells were seeded and cultured for 8 days; colonies 
were  stained  with  crystal  violet.  We  observed  scattered 
morphology of colonies in radioresistant H460R cells com-
pared with parental cells. To test the possibility of increased

metastasis  in  H460R  cells,  we  measured  migration  and 
representative MMP activities, including MMP2 and MMP9, 
using a wound healing assay (Fig. 2B and 2C) and gelatin 
zymography (Fig. 2D), respectively. We confirmed signifi-
cantly  increased  migration  as  well  as  MMP2  and  MMP9 
activities in H460R cells. Since E-cadherin and N-cadherin 
are known as important marker proteins for the epithelial- 
to-mesenchymal  transition,  expression  levels  of  these 
proteins  were  determined  via  Western  blot  analysis.  E- 
Cadherin  was  not  detected  (data  not  shown),  and  no 
difference  was  observed  in  the  expression  of  N-cadherin 
protein between H460 and H460R cells. However, β-catenin 
protein levels increased in radioresistant H460R cells (Fig. 
2D).

Differential response of H460R cells to γ-irradiation 

It  has  been  known  that  radioresistant  cells  have  some 
characteristics,  such  as  DNA  repair  and  anti-apoptotic 
properties,  in  response  to  IR  as  well  as  other  anticancer 
drugs [23]. Next, we checked the response to IR between 
parental  H460  cells  and  resistant  H460R  cells.  A  colony 
formation  assay  indicated  that  H460R  cells  were  more 
resistant to cell death than parental cells after 4 and 6 Gy 
irradiation (Fig. 3A and 3B). In addition, cell cycle analysis 
showed that H460 cells were subjected to early apoptosis, 
whereas  H460R  cells  were  arrested  at  the  G2/M  phase. 
Subsequently,  the  subG1  fraction  in  H460  cells  was  in-
creased 2-fold over H460R cells after 24 h with IR (Fig. 3C). 
From these results, we considered H460R cells to be radio-

resistant. To evaluate the cellular response to IR, levels of 
proteins with respect to DNA damage and cell cycle were 
analyzed. IR led to enhanced phosphorylation of p53 in the 
parental cells compared with H460R cells. While γ-H2AX 
expression appeared after 8 h and peaked 32 h after IR in 
parental cells, it was only slightly induced in radioresistant 
H460R cells. Moreover, p21, p27, and cyclin B1 remained 
increased in response to IR in H460R cells. We also observed 
that the cleaved form of PARP increased in H460 cells after 
8 h and peaked after 32 h, whereas a slight increase of cleaved 
PARP  was  observed  in  H460R  cells  (Fig.  3D).  X-linked 
inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression levels in-
creased in H460R cells but decreased in parental cells after 
IR exposure. To test whether IR induced upregulation of ER 
stress  in  the  two  cell  lines,  we  performed  Western  blot 
analysis for representative marker proteins, such as glucose- 
regulated protein 78 (GRP78), glucose-regulated protein 94 

(GRP94), and CHOP. In parental cells, GRP78 and CHOP 
increased in a time-dependent manner in response to IR up 
to 24 h and decreased after 32 h of IR, while expression of 
GRP94 decreased in a time-dependent manner following IR. 
Moreover, IR decreased GRP78 but increased GRP94 and 
CHOP slightly, which were rarely detected, regardless of IR 
in radioresistant cells (Fig. 3E). 

Global expression analysis and involvement of 
SNTB2 in radioresistance

A cDNA microarray was used to analyze DEGs in H460R 
cells in response to IR. Four hundred genes that were either 
up-regulated or down-regulated, demonstrating more than 
2-fold changes in H460R cells, are categorized in Table 1, 
which is shown to summarize the enriched gene ontology 
terms of the selected gene set. Among up-regulated genes in 
response to IR, we focused on genes listed in the ‘plasma

membrane’ category among the cellular components cate-
gories. In addition to being a membrane adapter protein, 
SNTB2 was modulated by interaction with MRP2 [24], a 
member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein super-
family, functioning as an ATP-dependent export pump for 
anionic  conjugates  in  the  apical  membranes  of  epithelial 
cells. Since ABC proteins have been implicated in resistance 
[25, 26], SNTB2 was selected for further analysis to evaluate 
whether it is involved in radioresistance. Consistent with the 
microarray data, protein levels of SNTB2 in H460 cells were 

highly increased in response to IR compared to the parental 
cells (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of SNTB2 by siRNA sensitized 
H460R cells as well as the parental cells to IR (Fig. 4B and 
4C), although the effect of si-SNTB2 on H460R was less 
compared with parental cells. SNTB2 expression levels were 
examined in other NSCLC cell lines to determine whether 
A549  and  H1299  cells  expressed  high  levels  of  SNTB2 
compared  with  H460  cells  and  H1299,  which  are  more 
resistant to IR exposure (Fig. 5A). We verified that knock-
down of SNTB2 by siRNA made H1299 cells more sensitive

to IR exposure (Fig. 5B and 5C), suggesting that SNTB2 
plays a role in radioresistance.

Discussion

Cancer cells often demonstrate resistance to IR, fail to 
arrest the cell cycle to repair DNA damage, and continue to 
proliferate under genotoxic stress [10]. Therefore, it is very 
important to understand radioresistance as well as enhanced 
invasiveness for RT. 

In  the  present  study,  we  established  radioresistant 
NSCLC  H460  cells  by  fractionated  low-dose  IR  and  eva-
luated their response to IR. Identification of DEGs related to 
DNA damage, cell growth, and ECM compared with parental 
cells  in  radioresistant  lung  cancer  cells  that  have  been 
developed by fractionated IR has been reported [23, 27]. IR 
induces  autophagy  and  the  formation  of  acidic  vesicular 
organelles in cancer cells [22]. We also found that H460R 
cells  had  a  distinct  morphology,  with  enhanced  cell  scat-
tering and an increase in acidic vesicular organelles. Low- 
dose IR has been shown to induce changes in the cellular 
microenvironment, leading to mesenchymal changes, and to 
significantly enhance the ability of migration and invasion in 
breast cancer cells [28]. Differentiation pathways have been 
involved in radioresistance as well as chemoresistance [29]. 
For  example,  Wnt/beta-catenin  mediates  radiation  resis-
tance [3, 30]. Some of these genes may be responsible for the 
emergence  of  resistance  to  therapy－for  example,  MMPs 
[31].  We  also  observed  that  radioresistant  H460R  cells 
exhibited  increased  activities  of  migration  and  represen-
tative MMPs, including MMP2 and MMP9, compared with 
parental  cells.  Our  findings  are  consistent  with  recent 
studies showing that MMPs are able to control metastasis [2, 
15,  32].  In  addition,  expression  of  β-catenin  appeared  in 
radioresistant cells but not in parental cells. Based on our 
observation  of  rare  expression  of  E-cadherin  and  N-cad-
herin,  β-catenin  might  play  an  important  role  in  radio-
resistant H460R cells. Our findings suggest that H460R cells 
might have the potential for invasion and metastasis, which 
will be elucidated in a future study. H460 cells with wild-type 
p53 responded with a shorter G2/M phase, leading to in-
creased  apoptosis  compared  with  radioresistant  H460R 
cells. Results from flow cytometry correlated with a series of 
Western blot data. Expression levels of XIAP decreased in 
the parental cells but increased in H460R cells. Expression 
patterns of GRP78 and GRP94 in H460R cells were different 
from  those  of  parental  cells.  Strongly  increased  CHOP 
protein levels in H460 cells after 8 h by IR, but not in H460R 
cells, were consistent with a previous study showing that 
CHOP-deficient  cells  have  enhanced  survival  when  chal-
lenged with toxins that induce ER stress [14]. These data 

suggest  that  H460R  cells  are  altered  in  response  to 
IR-induced ER stress as well as DNA damage.

In  this  study,  SNTB2  increased  after  IR  exposure,  and 
knockdown of SNTB2 led to an increase in sensitivity in both 
H460 and H460R cells in response to IR. However, the effect 
of si-SNTB2 on H460R was less compared with the parental 
cells. H460R cells can be considered to be genetically more 
heterogeneous  in  response  to  repeated  IR.  In  fact,  we 
observed  that  si-SNTB2  did  not  sufficiently  knock  down 
SNTB2 levels in H460R cells compared with the parental 
cells, based on data from the Western blot analysis. Hence, 
we alternatively utilized IR-resistant H1299 cells to confirm 
that  SNTB2  is  involved  in  radioresistance.  H1299  cells, 
which  express  endogenously  high  SNTB2  levels  and  are 
radioresistant,  were  more  sensitive  to  IR  exposure  when 
SNTB2 was down-regulated by siRNA. This suggests that 
overexpression  of  SNTB2  is  linked  to  radioresistance  in 
H1299 as well as H460R cells, implying that SNTB2 plays a 
critical  role in the radioresistance of cancer  cells. We are 
planning to explore the gain of function by SNTB2 using its 
ectopic overexpression in a further study and to clarify how 
SNTB2 plays a role in radioresistance.

In summary, we established H460R-radioresistant cells by 
fractionated low-dose IR and showed that these cells exhibit 
not only morphological changes but also a differential res-
ponse to IR at the molecular level compared with parental 
cells. Among DEGs, SNTB2 played a role in radioresistance. 
Therefore, H460R cells will be helpful as an in vitro cellular 
model of radioresistance to evaluate its mechanism and to 
develop drugs to overcome radioresistance occurring during 
RT.
