Obesity is a highly prevalent, chronic disorder that has been increasing in incidence in young patients. Both epigenetic and 
genetic aberrations may play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Therefore, in-depth epigenomic and genomic analyses will 
advance our understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying obesity and aid in the selection of potential 
biomarkers for obesity in youth. Here, we performed microarray-based DNA methylation and gene expression profiling of 
peripheral white blood cells obtained from six young, obese individuals and six healthy controls. We observed that the 
hierarchical  clustering  of  DNA  methylation,  but  not  gene  expression,  clearly  segregates  the  obese  individuals  from  the 
controls, suggesting that the metabolic disturbance that occurs as a result of obesity at a young age may affect the DNA 
methylation  of  peripheral  blood  cells  without  accompanying  transcriptional  changes.  To  examine  the  genome-wide 
differences in the DNA methylation profiles of young obese and control individuals, we identified differentially methylated 
CpG  sites  and  investigated  their  genomic  and  epigenomic  contexts.  The  aberrant  DNA  methylation  patterns  in  obese 
individuals  can  be  summarized  as  relative  gains  and  losses  of  DNA  methylation  in  gene  promoters  and  gene  bodies, 
respectively. We also observed that the CpG islands of obese individuals are more susceptible to DNA methylation compared 
to controls. Our pilot study suggests that the genome-wide aberrant DNA methylation patterns of obese individuals may 
advance not only our understanding of the epigenomic pathogenesis but also early screening of obesity in youth.

Introduction

Obesity is a disorder defined by excessive adiposity. Given 
that approximately 3 million people die due to complications 
from  being  overweight  each  year  worldwide,  the  steadily 
increasing  number  of  overweight  individuals  will  pose  a 
major threat to public health [1]. Notably, the prevalence of 
obesity  in  children  has  increased  in  recent  years,  and 
addressing childhood obesity has become one of the major 
challenges in the field of public health.

In  addition  to  a  number  of  modifiable  risk  factors,  in-
cluding the social and cultural environment of an individual, 
certain  genetic  factors  can  contribute  to  an  increased 
susceptibility to obesity. Genome-wide association studies 

have identified several candidate genomic variants on the 
LEP (leptin), IGF2, and POMC genes [2, 3]. However, such 
variants are observed in only a minority of obese individuals, 
leaving a majority of obese people without the identification 
of causal genomic factors [4]. Moreover, some studies failed 
to identify a strong association between the development of 
obesity in children and in their parents [5, 6]. Thus, the 
causal role of genetics in the etiology of childhood obesity is 
unclear,  suggesting  that  non-genetic  factors,  including 
behavioral  or  environmental  ones,  should  be  taken  into 
account. 

Recently,  the  role  of  epigenetic  regulation  in  the 
pathogenesis of multifactorial disorders, including obesity, 
has  been  recognized  [7].  With  the  advent  of  high- 
throughput DNA methylation profiling technologies, it is

now possible to discover novel genes and markers for the 
early  screening  and  accurate  diagnosis  of  obesity  on  a 
genome-wide scale. For example, Wang et al. [8] compared 
the DNA methylation profiles obtained from the peripheral 
blood  cells  of  seven  young  obese  and  seven  normal  in-
dividuals using the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip 
Kit, with a resolution of ∼27,000 CpG sites. They identified 
a number of potential markers (e.g., CpG sites located at the 
promoters of UBASH3A and TRIM3) that showed differential 
methylation  between  obese  and  control  individuals  and 
subsequently validated the loci with pyrosequencing. Almen 
et al. [9] used the same chip to identify DNA methylation 
markers associated with both age and obesity. Since these 
genome-wide studies have mainly focused on marker dis-
covery, in-depth genomic analyses (e.g., exploration of the 
relationship  between  differentially  methylated  CpG  sites 
and  other  genomic  features  or  gene  expression)  are  still 
largely uninvestigated.

In this study, we performed genome-wide DNA methy-
lation  and  transcriptome  profiling  of  young  obese  indivi-
duals compared with healthy controls (n = 6 for both groups) 
to examine whether changes in DNA methylation or gene 
expression in peripheral blood cells could distinguish obese 
individuals  from  controls.  For  methylation  profiling,  we 
used the methylation microarray with the highest resolution 
currently  available—the  Illumina  HumanMethylation450 
platform,  with  a  resolution  of  ∼485,000  CpG  sites—to 
ensure  proper  genomic  correlative  analyses.  Recognizing 
that DNA methylation can be used as a predictive marker for 
obesity, we next performed genomic correlative analyses of 
the DNA methylation patterns obtained during profiling to 
identify enrichment patterns of CpG sites that were differen-
tially  methylated  between  obese  and  control  individuals 
with respect to genes, CpG islands (CGIs), and epigenomic

compartments.  The  putative  functions  of  those  genes 
harboring  the  differentially  methylated  CpGs  were  also 
investigated. 

Methods
Patient and control samples

The subjects in this study were selected from a cohort that 
was part of a community-based prevention and management 
program  of  childhood  obesity  in  a  rural  area  of  Korea 
(Chungju,  Chungcheongbuk-do).  Twelve  participants,  six 
obese children with a high body mass index and six children 
with a normal body weight, were randomly selected for this 
pilot study (Table 1). All individuals were 12–13 years old, 
male and had an East Asian ancestry. Since the subjects of 
this study were minors, informed consent for all individuals 
was obtained in written format both from the participants 
and  their  parents.  This  study,  including  the  consent  pro-
cedure, has been approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(KIRB-00524-010)  at  The  Catholic  University  of  Korea, 
College of Medicine.

DNA methylation and expression profiling

The samples for DNA methylation and gene expression 
profiling experiments were prepared as follows. Blood from 
each individual was collected into two EDTA tubes (3 mL). 
After the contents had been sufficiently mixed for 5 min, the 
tubes were stored in a refrigerator. The genomic DNA and 
total RNA were extracted using DNeasy and RNeasy Blood 
and Tissue Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the 
manufacturer’s  protocol.  Bisulfite  conversion  of  genomic 
DNA was carried out using an EZ DNA methylation kit from 
Zymo Research (Irvine, CA, USA), and DNA methylation 
profiles  were  generated  using  the  Illumina  Human-

Methylation450  platform  (Illumina  Inc.,  San  Diego,  CA, 
USA). Background correction and dye bias equalization were 
conducted  using  methylumi  and  lumi  packages  in  R, 
respectively. Then, the data was normalized using the beta 
mixture  quantile  method  [10].  The  methylation  levels  of 
individual CpG sites were estimated as beta-values, which 
are the ratio of intensities between locus-specific methylated 
and unmethylated bead-bound probes. For statistical analysis, 
the DNA methylation level at each CpG site was converted to 
an M-value using the logit transformation as recommended 
by  Du  et  al.  [11]  and  Marabita  et  al.  [12].  The  probes 
annotated as NCBI’s reference SNP ID (rs ID) numbers were 
removed, then the methylation status of a total of 485,512 
CpG sites were used for the analysis. 

Genome-wide  gene  expression  levels  were  measured 
using an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip 
Kit, with 47,318 probes. The extraction of raw data and the 
subsequent  preprocessing  were  performed  using  the 
Illumina  GenomeStudio  software  according  to  the manu-
facturer’s  instructions.  The  obtained  expression  profiles 
were then quantile normalized using the R preprocessCore 
package. The DNA methylation and DNA expression profile 
datasets were submitted to ArrayExpress (accession numbers 
E-MTAB-3757 and E-MTAB-3753, respectively). DNA and 
RNA from 12 subjects were loaded onto a single 12-well chip 
for methylation and gene expression analyses, respectively, 
so  that  batch  effect  adjustment  did  not  need  to  be  con-
sidered. 

Unsupervised clustering

Hierarchical clustering for both gene expression and DNA 
methylation was carried out using the R package. Euclidean 
distance was used as a distance metric, and single-linkage 
clustering was adopted. For gene expression profiles, highly 
variable  genes  were  selected  using  the  mean  absolute 
deviation,  and  clustering  analyses  were  conducted  using 
these 1,000 selected genes.

Statistical analysis 

Hypermethylated  and  hypomethylated  CpG  sites  iden-
tified  in  each  sample  were  partitioned  using  a  Gaussian 
mixture  model  [13],  based  on  the  distribution  of  the 
M-values in each sample. For each sample, the Expectation- 
Maximization algorithm was run 100 times with different 
seed values, and the model with the largest likelihood value 
was  chosen  as  the  best-fit  model  within  the  100  ex-
periments. Then, the hyper methylated and hypomethylated 
CpG  sites  in  each  sample  were  assigned  by  selecting  the 
component with the bigger corresponding posterior proba-
bility. The analyses were performed using the R mixtools 
package [14]. The differentially methylated CpG sites and 

the differentially expressed genes were identified using the 
empirical Bayes model implemented in the limma package 
[15]. 

Chromatic region identification

Chromatin  statuses  were  obtained  from  ChromHMM 
results  [16],  coordinated  using  human  genome  build  37 
(hg19),  which  was  downloaded  from  the  University  of 
California,  Santa  Cruz  (UCSC)  Encyclopedia  of  DNA 
Elements (ENCODE) as a Browser Extensible Data (BED) 
format. The chromatin state at the differentially methylated 
CpG  sites  was  determined  by  finding  overlaps  with  the 
regions defined in the dataset given in the software.

Results
Differences in DNA methylation and gene 
expression patterns between obese and normal 
individuals

We  first  investigated  whether  gene  expression  levels 
and/or  DNA  methylation  profiles  can  distinguish  obese 
individuals  from  control  individuals  with  normal  body 
weights (n = 6 in each group). To this end, we performed 
unsupervised  hierarchical  clustering  analyses  using  gene 
expression  profiles.  No  clear  segregation  was  observed 
between the obese and control individuals using the gene 
expression profiles (Fig. 1A). In contrast to gene expression, 
hierarchical  clustering  using  DNA  methylation  profiling 
revealed  a  unique  cluster  of  obese  individuals  that  was 
segregated from the controls (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the 
obese  individuals  may  harbor  characteristic  epigenetic 
marks in their blood cells. We next investigated the global 
distribution  of  DNA  methylation  levels  of  all  CpG  sites 
examined  across  the  12  individuals.  The  distribution  of 
beta-values (Fig. 1C) showed a bimodal distribution whose 
two  peaks  correspond  to  the  hypomethylated  and  hyper-
methylated CpG sites. After transforming the beta-values to 
M-values (Fig. 1D), we divided the DNA methylation sites 
into hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG sites using 
the  Gaussian  mixture  model.  Boxplots  of  M-values  cor-
responding to hypomethylated and hypermethylated CpG 
sites  are  shown  for  each  sample  in  Fig.  1E  and  1F, 
respectively. Of note, when sorted by median value, a clear 
segregation of obese individuals from controls was observed 
in  both  profiles.  M-values  representing  hypomethylated 
CpG  sites  skewed  higher  for  obese  individuals  compared 
with controls, and the resulting shift in median values was 
responsible  for  the  segregation  of  obese  and  control 
individuals (p ≈ 0.0 for all normal vs. all obese; one-tailed t 
test) (Fig. 1E). In addition, the hypermethylated CpG sites of 
obese individuals tended to have lower M-values compared

obese and control individuals suggests that the difference in 

methylation  between  two  groups  may  be  subtle,  but  our 
analyses revealed the CpG sites in obese individuals may 
have less frequent hypomethylation and hypermethylation

compared to controls. 

The extent of DNA methylation varies across the 
genome

To investigate the level of CpG methylation with respect 
to nearby genes or CGIs, we categorized the CpG sites into 
six regional categories: the 3' untranslated region (UTR), 5' 
UTR, first exon, gene body, TSS200, and TSS1500. TSS200 
and  TSS1500  represent the  200 bp  and 1,500 bp  regions 
upstream of the transcription start site (TSS), respectively. 
We also categorized CpG sites as follows: CGIs (i.e., those 
belonging to CGIs), CGI shore and shelf (i.e., those located 
in the ＜2 kb flanking a CGI and the ＜2 kb flanking outward 
from a CpG shore, respectively), and ‘other.’ North (N) and 
south (S) indicate upstream and downstream of the CGI, 
respectively.  Fig.  2A  and  2B  show  the  number  of  hyper-
methylated and hypomethylated CpG sites, as distinguished 
by  M-values,  in  six  gene-based  and  five  CGI-based  CpG 
categories. 

We calculated the ratio of hypermethylated to hypome-
thylated  CpG  sites,  which  was  defined  as  the  number  of 
hypermethylated  CpG  sites  divided  by  the  number  of 
hypomethylated CpG sites (Supplementary Fig. 1). It should 
be  noted  that  the  ratio  of  hypermethylated  to  hypo-
methylated CpG sties varied markedly in all individuals with 
respect  to  the  genomic  contexts,  i.e.,  the  previously  des-
cribed gene-based (0.20–5.54) and CGI-based (0.23–8.66) 
regional categories. The genomic regions near TSSs, inclu-
ding  the  5'  UTR,  first  exon,  and  TSS200,  were  mainly 
dominated by hypomethylated CpG sites (the ratios were 
0.51, 0.24, and 0.20, respectively). By contrast, the CpG sites 
at  the  gene  body  and  3'  UTR  regions  were  usually 

hypermethylated  (the  ratios  were  2.47  and  5.54, 
respectively). Moreover, CGIs were usually hypomethylated 
(the ratio was 0.23), but the 5' and 3' CGI shelf regions were 
hypermethylated  (the  ratios  were  7.87  and  8.66, 
respectively).  The  observed  overall  pattern  of  DNA 
methylation with respect to nearby genes or CGIs agrees well 
with previous reports: CpG sites at promoters with active 
transcription  have  less  DNA  methylation  compared  to 
downstream compartments such as the gene body, and CpG 
sites at CGIs are relatively free from methylation. 

The genomic and epigenomic landscape of 
differentially methylated CpG sites in obesity

We next identified the CpG sites differentially methylated 
between  obese  and  control  individuals.  A  total  of  6,041 
differentially methylated CpG sites were identified to have a 
significance  level  of  p  ＜ 0.001.  The  false  discovery  rate 
(FDR) was 0.08 when the Benjamini-Hochberg method was 
applied to adjust the p-values. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows a 
Manhattan plot for the log-transformed significance levels of 
all CpG sites investigated.

Fig.  3A  shows  an  uneven  distribution  of  differentially 
methylated  CpG  sites  with  respect  to  the  six  gene-based 
CpG  categories.  The  over-  and  under-representation  of 
differentially methylated CpG sites was observed in gene 
body, TSS200, and TSS1500 regions (p = 4.6 × 10-50, p = 
4.33 × 10-12, and p = 4.33 × 10-19, respectively). When the 
genomic context of CGIs was taken into account (Fig. 3B), a 
relative deficit of differentially methylated CpG sites in the 
nearby  TSS  regions  was  observed  in  CGIs,  while  the 
enrichment  of  differentially  methylated  CpG  sites  in  the 
gene body was observed at regions distant from CGI (i.e.,

CGI shelves and others).

Next, we divided the differentially methylated CpG sites 
into  hypermethylated  and  hypomethylated  sites  in  obese 
children. We annotated them as ‘obese-hypermethylated and 
obese-hypomethylated CpGs’ to distinguish them from the 
hypomethylated/hypermethylated  CpG  sites  identified  in 
individual M-value  profiles.  We observed  a dominance  of 
obese-hypomethylated CpG sites (79.1%; 4,779 sites) over 
obese-hypermethylated  CpG  sites  among  all  of  the 
differentially  methylated  CpG  sites  (Fig.  3C).  We  then 
investigated the relative ratio of obese-hypermethylated to 
obese-  hypomethylated  CpG  sites  in  gene-based  and 
CGI-based regional categories (Fig. 3D and 3E). The majority 
of differentially methylated CpG sites in the gene body and 3' 
UTR  regions  were  obese-hypomethylated  CpG  sites  (the 
ratios of obese-hypermethylated/obese-hypomethylated CpG 
sites in these regions were 0.13 and 0.03, respectively) (Fig. 
3D). On the other hand, the differentially methylated sites in 
the genomic regions near the TSS, such as the TSS200 and 
first exon regions, were mainly composed of obese-hyper-
methylated  CpG  sites  (the  ratios  were  2.14  and  1.52, 
respectively) (Fig. 3D). A dominance of obese-hypermethy-
lated CpG sites was also noted in CGI regions (the ratio was 
1.64), whereas CpG sites in CGI-shelf regions were largely 

obese-hypomethylated  (the  ratio  was  0.02)  (Fig.  3E).  Of 
note, 70.8% of obese-hypermethylated CpG sites were found 
in CGIs. 

Next, we categorized the differentially methylated CpG 
sites according to 15 different chromatin states, as described 
in the ChromHMM software [16]. Given the tissue-specific 
epigenetic configurations, we elected to use the annotation 
dataset of lymphoid origin (from the GM12878 lymphoblas-
toid cell line) as the profile that best matched ours. We first 
observed that the differentially methylated CpG sites were 
overrepresented  mainly  on  transcribed  regions  (Fig.  4A). 
The p-values were 2.91 × 10-3, 1.63 × 10-11, and 8.31 × 10-16 
for  the  9_Txn_Transition  (transcription  transition),  10_ 
Txn_elongation  (transcription  elongation)  and  11_Weak_ 
Txn  (weak  transcription)  regions,  respectively  (Fisher’s 
exact test). It was also observed that promoter and enhancer 
regions  were  largely  depleted  of  differentially  methylated 
CpG  sites.  In  particular,  all  promoter-related  states  re-
presented  in  the  first  three  state  categories  (1_Active_ 
Promoter,  2_Weak_Promoter,  and  3_Poised_Promoter) 
showed underrepresentation for the differentially methyla-
ted  CpG  sites  (Fig.  4A).  That  is,  as  we  observed  in  the 
genomic  regional  abundance  analysis,  the  differentially 
methylated  CpG  sites  were  mainly  found  at  the  genomic

regions marked for active transcription. When the differen-
tially  methylated  CpG  sites  were  categorized  into  obese- 
hypermethylated and obese-hypomethylated CpG sites (Fig. 
4B), a majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites in 
transcribed and promoter-related regions were obese-hyper- 
and  obese-hypomethylated  CpG  sites,  respectively.  For 
instance, 96.6% of CpG sites in active promoter regions, as 
well as 95.7% and 62.4% of CpG sites at poised promoter and 
weak promoter, respectively, were obese-hypermethylated 
CpG sites. In contrast to the promoter regions, 95.7% of the 
differentially methylated CpG sites in transcriptional regions, 
annotated  in  ChromHMM  as  transcriptional  transition, 
elongation,  or  weak  transcription,  showed  lower  DNA 
methylation levels in obese children.

We next identified 21 genes with significant enrichment of 
differentially  methylated  CpG  sites  in  the  obese  children 
(Fisher’s exact test; p ＜ 0.001) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The 
CpG sites in the enriched genes were mainly obese-hypo-
methylated  and  located  mostly  in  the  gene  body  region, 
which  was  expected  given  the  overall  distribution  of 
differentially methylated CpG sites. We further investigated 
the extent of differential expression of these genes between 
the obese and control individuals using the same statistical 
method as was used for the identification of the differentially 
methylated  CpG  sites  (R  limma  package;  see  Methods). 
However,  none  of  these  21  genes  showed  significantly 
differential expression (unadjusted p ＜ 0.001). Supplemen-
tary Table 1 lists the significance level for the differential

expression of 18 of the 21 genes; excluded are MIR1185-2, 
FLJ39609, and CELA2A, with no expression values available. 
Although one gene, ZNF154, with obese-hypermethylation 
at  TSS200  showed  a  slight  downregulation  in  expression 
(unadjusted p ＜ 0.05), most cases showed no clear relation-
ship between gene expression and CpG methylation. One 
possible explanation for this observation is that the differen-
tially  methylated  CpG  sites  at  the  enriched  genes  were 
mainly located in the gene body, the methylation of which is 
not always associated with the expression of the genes, in 
contrast to the methylation of regulatory regions such as 
gene promoters. In this exploratory study, we focused on the 
identification of differentially methylated CpG sites that may 
be able to distinguish young obese individuals from young 
normal individuals; the association between gene expression 
and  CpG  methylation,  as  well  as  their  early  diagnostic 
potential, requires further investigation.

Lastly, we investigated the potential relationship between 
the observed genes with significant enrichment of differen-
tially methylated CpG sites and the pathogenesis of obesity 
based  on  previously  published  studies.  Among  the  genes 
with differentially methylated CpG sites, ZNF154 encodes a 
member of the zinc finger protein family, which are trans-
criptional regulators of adipogenesis [17]. POLR3E encodes 
DNA-directed RNA polymerase III subunit RPC5, and it is 
known that the loss of MAF, which is a repressor of RNA 
polymerase III, affects resistance to obesity [18]. Although 
the  direct  effects  of  SDK1,  which  encodes  sidekick  cell 
adhesion molecule 1, on obesity are unknown, some studies 
have investigated the relationships between cellular adhesion 
molecules  and  obesity  [19].  KIAA0146  is  a  scaffolding 
protein involved in DNA repair, and it has been reported that 
DNA damage or DNA repair deficiency may be associated 
with obesity [20]. GPR125 encodes a membrane protein that 
belongs  to  the  G  protein-coupled  receptor  superfamily. 
Previous  studies  have  revealed  that  G  protein-coupled 
receptors may serve as therapeutic targets for obesity and 
type  2  diabetes  [21].  CAPS2  encodes  a  calcium-binding 
protein and may function in the regulation of the secretion of 
insulin [22]. RNF213 encodes a ring finger protein, which is 
a specialized type of zinc finger protein. A study found the 
depletion of RNF213 increased glucose tolerance in mice 
[23].  CELA2A  belongs  to  the  chymotrypsin-like  elastase 
family, and a relationship between neutrophil elastase and 
insulin resistance has been previously reported [24]. Given 
that some of the genes harbor more frequent than expected 
differentially  methylated  CpG  sites  have  been  previously 
implicated in the metabolic disorders, further investigation 
of these genes and their role in childhood obesity is required.

Discussion

In this study, we carried out the microarray-based pro-
filing of DNA methylation and gene expression in peripheral 
white blood cells obtained from obese and normal children. 
We  investigated  whether  the  DNA  methylation  or  gene 
expression profiles (1) are distinct between the young obese 
individuals  and  controls,  (2)  show  unique  enrichment 
patterns of hyper-vs-hypomethylated CpG sites with respect 
to nearby genes or CGIs, and (3) whether such enrichment 
patterns are also observed for CpG sites that are differen-
tially  methylated  between  young  obese  individuals  and 
controls. 

We first examined whether the gene expression or DNA 
methylation profiles could be used to distinguish the obese 
individuals from the normal control individuals. Unsuper-
vised clustering of the DNA methylation profiles segregated 
the  obese  individuals  from  controls,  suggesting  that  the 
young obese individuals harbor epigenetic marks in their 
peripheral blood cells that are distinct from those of normal 
controls. For marker selection, we further performed leave- 
one-out-cross-validation,  k-nearest  neighborhood  (k-NN) 
method-based  marker  selection,  and  predictive  modeling. 
For 12 rounds of iterations, we selected the top 100 differen-
tially methylated sites using the empirical Bayes approach 
and predicted the phenotypes of the selected cases. However, 
we  did  not  achieve  a  good  classification  accuracy  using 
jackknife  approaches  for  cross-validation  for  the  gene 
expression datasets or the DNA methylation profiles. The 
results imply that obesity cannot be completely predicted by 
a  small  number  of  candidate  biomarkers.  Instead,  our 
genome-wide analyses showed that there are aberrant DNA 
methylation patterns in obese children compared to normal 
children.

Abnormal DNA methylation patterns have been observed 
in wide variety of human diseases. Certain studies suggest 
that abnormal DNA methylation patterns in some of these 
diseases include the loss of DNA methylation on gene bodies 
and the gain of DNA methylation on gene promoter CGIs, 
which is by and large the opposite of the normal physio-
logical methylation pattern found in the human genome [25, 
26].  Our  analyses  revealed  that  the  majority  of  the 
differentially methylated CpG sites are those with relative 
hypomethylation in obese children. Such obese-hypomethy-
lated CpG sites were overrepresented in gene body regions 
and represented one of the major epigenetic alterations in 
the blood cells of young obese individuals. In addition, our 
results implied that regulatory CpG sites near TSS in obese 
individuals  tended  to  be  relatively  hypermethylated  com-
pared to controls. This observation was further validated by

JK  Rhee, et al.  DNA  Methylation  in  Obese  Children

the evaluation of chromatin status using chromHMM data, 
where the combined analyses showed relative hypermethy-
lation of regulatory regions (active, weak, and poised promo-
ters)  but  hypomethylation  of  transcribed  regions  (those 
annotated as transcription transition, elongation, or weak 
transcription) in obese individuals compared to controls.

When  we  searched  for  differentially  expressed  genes 
using the same criteria as those used for the differentially 
methylated CpG sites, a relatively small number of genes 
with a p ＜ 0.001 and a corresponding FDR of 0.91 were 
identified (Supplementary Table 2). Given the fact that the 
expression-based k-NN predictive model failed to identify 
obese individuals, the gene expression profiles may not serve 
as appropriate biomarkers of obesity in youth. However, we 
found that some of the top-ranked genes were also related to 
epigenetic  regulation.  For  example,  histone  deacetylases 
(HDACs) are related to insulin sensitivity, and HDAC in-
hibition  can  be  a  treatment  for  diabetes.  Moreover, since 
HDAC2 can directly bind to DNMT1, a widely expressed 
DNA  methyltransferase  that  plays  a  role  in  maintaining 
DNA  methylation  patterns  [27],  the  change  in  HDAC2 
expression may be related to the aberrant DNA methylation 
patterns we observed in obese individuals.

Our  pilot  study  provides  a  line  of  evidence  for  the 
importance  of  epigenomic  characteristics  in  investigating 
childhood  obesity  and  also  the  potential  utility  of  such 
markers  for  the  early  diagnosis  of  obese  children.  Blood 
represents a mixture of multiple types of cells, the composi-
tion of which has been reported to vary between obese and 
lean individuals. For example, through analysis of blood cell 
fractions, a study verified that DNA methylation in B cell and 
natural killer lymphocytes is altered in obese subjects [28]; 
other  studies  have  reported  similar  results  [29,  30].  The 
cellular heterogeneity and the differing number of blood cell 
counts between individuals could affects DNA methylation 
analysis  [31].  Thus,  further  investigation  of  the  DNA 
methylation  profiles,  with  consideration  of  the  cell 
heterogeneity in blood, may lead to a clearer understanding 
of the epigenomic differences in obese children.

To date, a number of genome-wide studies have presented 
associations  between  inherited  germline  variants  and 
metabolic  disorders,  such  as  type  2  diabetes  and  obesity. 
However, a majority of patients still lack clarity on the causal, 
heritable factors underlying their disease, suggesting that 
there  are  still  many  limitations  to  overcome  for  these 
germline markers to be practically used for diagnostic and 
prognostic  purposes.  Measuring  the  alterations  in  DNA 
methylation  profiles  detectable  in  blood  as  a  minimally 
invasive  biological  resource  may  be  useful  not  only  in 
understanding the epigenomic effects on obesity, but also in 
providing  critical  insight  and  clinical  applications  for  the 

early  detection  of  obesity.  However,  our  findings  were 
obtained  from  a  relatively  small  cohort  (n  =  6),  so  the 
statistical power was limited. Thus, the interpretation of the 
results from our pilot study requires caution. Further in-
vestigation to ascertain the clinical impact of our results is 
needed  in  a  larger,  independent  cohort  of  young  obese 
individuals.  Additional  studies  integrating  genetic  and 
epigenetic information could unveil clues that deepen our 
understanding of the pathogenesis of obesity and that help 
to improve the diagnostic and prognostic markers for use in 
the clinic.
