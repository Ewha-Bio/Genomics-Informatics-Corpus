Abstract

WebChemDB  is  an  integrated  chemical  database  re-
trieval  system  that  provides  access  to  over  8  million 
publicly  available  chemical  structures,  including  related 
information  on  their  biological  activities  and  direct  links 
to  other  public  chemical  resources,  such  as  PubChem, 
ChEBI,  and  DrugBank.  The  data  are  publicly  available 
over  the  web,  using  two-dimensional  (2D)  and  three-di-
mensional  (3D)  structure  retrieval  systems  with  various 
filters  and  molecular  descriptors.  The  web  services  API 
also  provides  researchers  with  functionalities  to  pro-
grammatically  manipulate,  search,  and  analyze  the  data.

Availability:  The  database  is  accessible  at  http://bio-
community.kr/chemsearch/index.jsp.

Keywords:  Chemical  database,  biological  activities,  struc-
ture  retrieval  system,  molecular  descriptors

Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI).  But,  many 
of  the  kinds  of  information  that  biologists  find  most  in-
teresting  (links  to  primary  literature;  characterization  data 
in  the  form  of  spectra,  solubilities,  melting/boiling  points, 
etc.)  do  not  appear  in  PubChem.
    Although  the  existing  databases,  in  their  current  form, 
consist  mainly  of  a  catalog  of  biologically  relevant  mole-
cules,  increasing  the  level  of  crosslinking  to  other  bio-
logical  databases  could  result  in  a  much  more  useful 
service.  As  chemical  databases  that  contain  intersecting 
information  continue  to  proliferate,  such  crosslinking  is 
likely  to  increase  in  importance  (http://zusammen.meta-
molecular.com/).
    This  paper,  therefore,  presents  an  integrated  chemical 
database  retrieval  system  for  searching,  visualizing,  and 
analyzing  chemical  structures  with  associated  biological 
information,  including  precalculated  values  for  molecular 
properties  (e.g.,  3D  coordinates,  molecular  weight,  polar 
surface  area,  hydrogen  bond  donors/acceptors,  rotat-
able  bonds,  XLogP,  etc.).  The  system  also  offers  a  fo-
cused  subset  of  calculated  properties  (e.g.,  drug-like, 
lead-like,  etc.)  for  molecules  that  are  filtered  by  physical 
properties.  As  such,  it  may  be  useful  to  those  who  per-
form  docking  experiments  or  build  focused  chemical 
databases.

Introduction

Data  and  processing

Small  molecules  can  be  used  as  building  blocks  for 
combinatorial  chemical  synthesis;  as  molecular  probes 
for  analyzing  biological  systems  in  systems  biology;  and 
for  the  screening,  design,  and  discovery  of  useful  drug 
compounds  (Chen et al.,  2005;  Ahn,  2007;  Kang et al., 
2009).  Tying  together  many  disparate  sources  of  chem-
ical  and  life  sciences  data  into  an  integrated  database 
is  one  of  the  main  issues  in  the  bioinformatics  commu-
nity.  Large  public  chemical  databases,  such  as  Pub-
Chem  (Wang et al.,  2009)  and  DrugBank  (Wishart et al., 
2008),  provide  chemical  structures  and  associated  bio-
logical  information,  focusing  on  small  organic  molecules 
that  have  potential  use  in  drug  development  with  bio-
medical  research.
    PubChem  is  an  increasingly  popular,  free-access,  on-
line  molecular  database  that  is  operated  by  the  National

The  data  were  collected  from  and  cross-referenced  to 
public  chemical  data  resources,  such  as  PubChem 
(Wang  et al.,  2009),  the  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes 
and  Genomes  (KEGG)  (Kanehisa et al.,  2000),  the  Che-
mical  Entities  of  Biological  Interest  (ChEBI)  (Degtyarenko 
et  al.,  2008),  NMRShiftDB  (Steinbeck  et  al.,  2004), 
Distributed  Structure-Searchable  Toxicity  (DSSTox)  (Ri-
chard et al.,  2002),  and  DrugBank  (Wishart et al.,  2008).
    The  public  chemical  data  are  available  in  various  data 
formats  (e.g.,  MOL,  SDF,  SMILES,  etc.).  Therefore,  our 
parsing  tool  was  used  to  parse  the  public  chemical  data 
to  extract  data  according  to  field  name  mapping  table, 
which  were  then  dynamically  uploaded  to  the  database. 
The  database  schema  consisted  of  chemical  identi-
fication  information  and  associated  data,  ranging  from 
molecular  descriptors  to  pathway  data,  spectroscopic 
data,  and  toxicological  data.  The  molecular  descriptors 
(3D  coordinates,  hydrogen-bond  donors,  hydrogen-bond 
acceptors,  octanol/water  partition  coefficient  log  P,  etc.) 
that  were  not  available  in  the  imported  data  were  calcu-

lated  by  using  the  calculation  modules  that  were  avail-
able  from  CDK  (Steinbeck et al.,  2003).  The  detailed  in-
formation  on  the  database  schema  and  records  are 
available  at  http://biocommunity.kr/chemsearch/schema. 
pdf.  The  database  was  implemented  using  the  leading 
open-source  relational  database  MySQL  (http://www. 
mysql.com).

Query  Tool  and  User  Interface 

The  database  can  search  over  8  million  compounds 
through  the  structure  retrieval  systems,  which  provide 
capabilities  for:  (1)  two-dimensional  (2D)  structure  sear-
ches;  (2)  three-dimensional  (3D)  structure  searches  (Ray-
mond et al.,  2003);  (3)  text  searches;  and  (4)  filter  sear-
ches.  The  three  search  types  that  are  available  on  the 
2D  structure  search  page  are  as  follows:  (1)  Substruc-
ture  Search  (the  default):  the  search  for  all  compounds 
that  have  that  “substructure”and  other  atoms.  (2) 
Similarity  Search:  the  search  for  all  compounds  that 
contain  structural  features  that  are  similar,  based  on  the 
Tanimoto  coefficient  (Butina,  1999).  (3)  Exact  Structure: 
the  search  for  all  compounds  that  are  exact  structure 
matches  in  the  database.  The  text  search  retrieves  all 

Fig.  1.  Screenshot  of  the  webpage.  The  chemical  structures  shown  in  the  sketcher  window  of  the  two-dimensional  (2D) 
search  can  be  searched  in  the  three  search  types  (Exact,  Substructure,  and  Similarity).  The  similarity  threshold  is  accom-
plished  by  setting  the  parameters  of  the  similarity  measure  to  0%  and  100%  in  the  similarity  search  type.  The  search  option 
has  maximum  hits  and  maximum  time  to  restrict  search  spaces.  The  search  is  integrated  with  molecular  descriptors  as 
standard  filters,  like  those  shown  to  restrict  the  results  by  molecular  weight,  hydrogen-bond  acceptor,  hydrogen-bond  donors,
predicted  XLogP,  rotatable  bonds,  and  polar  surface  area.  The  user  can  specify  ranges  for  combinations  of  five  molecular 
descriptors.  The  Descriptor  button  shows  molecular  descriptors  of  the  query  compound.

compounds  by  using  text-matching  capabilities.  The  fil-
ter  search  finds  useful  drug  compounds  by  using  known 
filters,  such  as  drug-like,  newton-hit-like,  fragment-like, 
greasy-leads,  lead-like,  and  big-n-greasy,  as  shown  in 
Table  1.
    The  proposed  system  uses  MarvinSketch  (http:// 
www.chemaxon.com/product/msketch.html)  for  drawing 
molecules  and  queries,  MarvinView  (http://www.chemax-
on.  com/product/mview.html)  for  viewing  single  and  mul-
tiple  chemical  structures,  and  CDK  for  calculating  phys-
icochemical  properties  (e.g.,  molecular  weight,  hydro-
gen-bond  acceptor/donors,  etc.)  and  filtering  database 
search  results.  The  two-dimensional  (2D)  structure  sear-
ch  engine  and  structure  database  tables  are  made  by 
using  the  JChem  library  (http://www.chemaxon.com/ 
jchem/intro/index.html)  from  ChemAxon,  Inc.  The  search 
engine  will  then  retrieve  all  of  the  molecules  in  the  data-
base  that  contain  the  specified  chemical  structure.  Data 
from  associated  property  files  can  be  displayed  along 
with 
the  structures  or  searched  as  an  additional 
parameter.  Web  interfaces  are  delivered  using  the  open- 
source  Tomcat  Web  server  (http://tomcat.apache.org). 
The  web  interface  provides  the  user  with  a  wide  array 
of  filters  and  threshold  values  to  be  tailored  to  different 
searches  (Fig.  1).  A  user  can  either  draw  the  compound 
to  be  searched  for  using  MarvinSketch  or  enter  its 
SMILES  string,  and  choose  the  type  of  structure  search

ilarity  threshold  to  use.  The  structures  of  matching  com-
pounds  are  returned  (Fig.  2).  Clicking  on  a  returned 
structure  leads  to  detailed  information  on  the  corre-
sponding  compound  (Fig.  3).  Many  of  the  application 
tools,  scripts,  and  Web  interfaces  are  written  in  Java 
(http://java.sun.com),  SQL,  and  JSP  (JavaServer  Pages).

The  web  services  API   

In  recent  years,  Internet  technology  for  application- 
to-application  communication,  commonly  referred  to  as 
web  services,  has  expanded  rapidly  due  to  growing 
needs  (Shuichi et al.,  2003).  Web  services  enable  users 
to  develop  software  that  accesses  and  manipulates 
massive  amounts  of  data  that  are  constantly  refreshed. 
We  have  developed  a  web  service  API  using  SOAP 
(Simple  Object  Access  Protocol)  and  WSDL  (Web  Ser-
vice  Definition  Language)  to  programmatically  manipu-
late,  search,  and  analyze  chemical  structure  data  in 
WebChemDB  (Table  2).  The  WSDL  file,  web  service  cli-
ent  library,  and  sample  source  codes  are  available  at 
http://biocommunity.kr/chemsearch/api.jsp.

Conclusions

WebChemDB  is  an  integrated  chemical  database  that 
contains  over  8  million  small  molecules,  collected  and 
crosslinked  from  public  chemical  resources.  The  data 
are  publicly  available  on  the  worldwide  web  for  down-
load  and  for  targeted  searches  using  a  variety  of  power-
ful  search  engines.  The  chemical  data  include  predicted 
or  experimentally  determined  physicochemical  proper-
ties,  such  as  3D  structures  and  predicted  xLogP.  Web 
services  API  can  help  users  to  programmatically  manip-
ulate,  search,  and  analyze  chemical  structure  data  in 
WebChemDB.  In  the  future,  we  will  make  a  workflow 
extension  package  for  workflow  systems,  such  as  Ta-
verna  (Hull  et al.,  2006)  and  KNIME  (Michael  et al., 

2008),  that  enables  users  to  visually  create  data  flows, 
selectively  execute  some  or  all  analysis  steps,  and  in-
vestigate  the  results  later  through  interactive  views  on 
data  and  models.
