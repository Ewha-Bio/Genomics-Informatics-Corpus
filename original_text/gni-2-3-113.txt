Introduction 
Constitutional  chromosomal  alterations  are  commonly 
detected  features  in  various  human  diseases  such  as 
tumor,  congenital anomalies,  psychiatric disorders, and 
metabolic disorders. Neoplastic transformations, for exarrple, 
are  initiated  by the  aberrations of  genes  regulating  cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, genome stability, angiogenesis, 
invasion and metastasis (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). 
Through  the  population  genetics  studies,  some  tumor 
suppresor  genes  and  oncogenes  have  been  verified 
(Wakabayashi eta/., 2003; Huges eta/., 2001; Wilentz et 
a/.,  2001 ;  Herranz  et  a/.,  1999).  And  the  causative 
chromosomal  alterations  for  some  congenital  genetic 
disorders have been identified by conventional cytogenetic 
tools.  However,  there  will  be  even  more  unknown 
tumor-related genes, supposedly up to several hundreds, 
yet  to  be  found  (Balmain,  2002),  and  still  a  lot  of 
idiopathic  psychiatric/  metabolic  disorders  of  unknown 
origin.  In this aspect, precise detection of the breakpoint 
of  chromosomal  dosage  change,  together  with  the 
functional and clinical studies, is essential to understand 
the  causes  of  these  disorders  and  to  prevent  them. 
Microarray  technology  makes  it  possible  to  do  high(cid:173)
throughput  and  high-resolution  analysis.  Combination  of 
conventional  comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH) 
and  microarray  technology  promises  us  genome-wide 
high-resolution  DNA copy number analysis.  We  review 
here  the  recent  progress  of  the  array  based  CGH 
(A-CGH) technology and its clinical applications. 

Historical background of A-CGH 
In 1992, Kallioniemi and colleagues first reported CGH to

tissues  are  not  available 

investigate the  type  and  location  of  DNA copy  number 
changes across whole genome (Kallioniemi eta/., 1992). 
This technique  is  based on  the  principle that test  DNA 
and  reference  DNA,  labeled  with  different  fluorescent 
dyes, are competitively hybridized to normal metaphase 
chromosomes.  The  ratio  of 
fluorescence 
intensities detected is indicative of the relative DNA copy 
number differences in test versus reference DNA. If both 
genomic  DNA  have the  same  allelic copy  number,  the 
ratio  will  be  1.  If  there  is  a single copy deletion  in  one 
allele, then the ratio will  be 0.5 and in the case of copy 
number gains,  the ratio will  be 3:2 (single copy gain)  or 
4:2 (2 copy gain) or more.  When the chromosome-wide 
fluorescence  ratio  data  is  combined  with  chromosome 
banding  data,  we  can  locate  the  global  copy  number 
changes. This concept of CGH introduced a new paradigm 
of  chromosome  analysis.  Conventional  karyotyping 
needs  metaphase  chromosome  spread  from  the  test 
tissue. Tissue culture is time consuming and most of the 
for  metaphase 
disease 
preparation  in  practice.  Even  though  we could  get the 
metaphase  spread,  it  is  very  difficult  to  interpret  and 
locate  the  regional  gain  or  loss  by  karyotyping.  CGH 
technology  renders  us  to  overcome  the  difficulties  of 
karyotyping and improve quality of analysis. For example, 
commercialized normal  chromosome slide could be  used 
instead  of  a  metaphase  chromosome  from  the  test 
tissue. With this new concept, we could also circumvent 
several  limitations  of  loss  of  heterozygosity  (LOH) 
analysis,  another  common  approach  to  analyze  the 
allelic dosage changes.  Firstly,  CGH  enables genome(cid:173)
wide  investigation  by  single  hybridization.  By  LOH 
analysis, theoretically, several thousands of microsatellite 
marker PCR and electrophoreses should be performed for 
the  genome-wide  analysis  with  similar  resolution.  To 
achieve  high-resolution  genome-wide  screening,  LOH 
analysis  is  expensive  and  time- consuming.  Secondly, 
CGH  can  distinguish  between  loss and  gain  of  genetic 
material  contrary 
to  LOH  analysis.  Using  CGH 
technology, a lot of cancer related chromosomal alterations 
have been identified from various tumors (Mathew eta/., 
2003;  Balsara  and  Testa,  2002;  Buerger  et a/.,  1999; 
Nessling eta/., 1998; Wolf eta/., 1999; Ried eta/., 1995). 
However  CGH  also  has 
limitations.  The 
resolution  of  CGH  is  not  high  enough  (10-20  Mb)  to 
localize  regional  chromosome  imbalances,  which  are 
commonly detected in tumors (Knuutila eta/., 1999; Ried

and reference genomic DNA are labeled with different fluorescent dyes and co-hybridized onto the array slide after blocking

eta/., 1999). For scoring the low resolution chromosome 
banding,  researchers  need  to  be  highly  experienced. 
Because  of  these  limitations,  results  from  some  less 
experienced laboratories were not trustworthy nor valid. 
But  still  CGH  is  an  attractive  method  to  investigate 
genetic imbalances for tumorigenesis up to now. 

Scientists  have  been  attempting  to  surmount  low 
resolution  of  CGH  and  accentuate  its  advantages  by 
combining  CGH  and  microarray  (Pollack  eta/.,  1999; 
Albertson and Pinkel,  2003).  100-200 kb sized bacterial 
artificial  chromosomes  (BAC)  clones  are  used  to  build 
tile-path covering all the autosomal and sex chromosomes, 
from  which  array chips are  produced for CGH  analysis 
(Fig.  1). The use of insert genomic clones such as BAGs 
or PACs for A-CGH provides sufficiently intense signals 
so that accurate measurements can be obtained for copy 
number  change  and  direct  chromosomal  mapping  is 
possible. Recent development of the bioinformatics tools 
for A-CGH analysis allows more objective and accurate 
localization  of  chromosome  alterations  (Jong  et  a/., 

2004;  Myers  et  a/.,  2004;  Wang  et  a/.,  2004). 
Furthermore,  since  the  array  format  lends  itself  to 
automation,  it is possible to  minimize person-to-person 
variation.  With  completion  of  Human  Genome  Project 
draft in  2001  and  Mouse Genome Project draft in 2002 
making  map  of  BAC  clones  covering  whole  genome 
more  accurate  and  refined,  cancer  researches  using 
A-CGH  are  being  more facilitated  (Pinkel  eta/.,  1998; 
Hodgson  eta/.,  2001;  Snijders  eta/.,  2001;  Cai  eta/., 
2002;  O'Hagan  et  a/.,  2002;  Albertson,  2003).  Even 
though A-CGH greatly improved in array production and 
analysis,  it  cannot  be  omnipotent.  It  is  important  to 
remember that A-CGH does not provide information on 
reciprocal translocation or polyploidy. 

Technical consideration of A-CGH 
First step to construction of genomic arrays is to prepare 
the set of BAC clones covering whole human genome. 
There are several different types of artificial chromosomes 

Current Status and Future Clinical Applications of Array~based Comparative Genomic Hybridization  115 

carrying human genome;  Bacterial  artificial chromosome 
(BAC), Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC), P1  bacteriophage 
artificial  chromosome  (PAC)  and  cosmid.  BAC clone is 
the  most  popular  resource  for  A-CGH  fabrication.  The 
size of insert is different from host to host.  For example, 
BAC can  carry about 200  kb,  YAC  0.2-2  Mb,  and  PAC 
130-150  kb  at  maximum  respectively.  Even  though 
spotting DNA directly onto the slide is the simplest and 
most  accurate  way,  it  is  not  always  easy  in  practice. 
Firstly, since BAC is single copy, yields of BAC DNA are 
low. Secondly, high-molecular DNA sized more than 1 00 
kb  from  BACs  can  be  viscous,  blocking  the  spotting 
needles  intermittently.  Therefore,  researchers  have  to 
do large amount bacterial cultures and sonicate the DNA 
to reduce the molecular weight down (Pinkel eta/., 1998; 
Cai  eta/.,  2002).  To  overcome these  limitations again, 
new  technique  was  adopted;  extract  small  amount  of 
BAC  DNA  automatically  from  large  number  of  small 
scaled culture and amplify them by using whole genome 
amplification such as, ligation mediated PCR (Snijders et 
a/., 2001; Klein eta/., 1999) or degenerated oligonucleotide 
primed  (DOP)  (Hodgson  eta/.,  2001;  Veltman  eta/., 
2002).  Another  new approach  enabling  construction  of 
arrays  from  minute  amount  of  DNA  is  rolling  circle 
amplification  (Dean  et  a/.,  2002).  This  rolling  circle 
amplified products were proved to be a suitable resource 
for A-CGH  (Smirnov  eta/.,  2004).  This approach could 
also  be  used  for  small  amount  of  tissue  (Lage  eta/., 
2003;  Paris eta/., 2003). These novel techniques are to 
amplify target sequences in  BAC clones nonspecifically 
across the  whole  genome,  therefore  it  could  represent 
genomic  complexity.  DOP  amplification  is  the  most 
commonly used method for array preparation nowadays. 
Figure  2  represents  the  example  of  DOP  primer  and 
amplification  of  BAC  DNA  by  DOP  PCR.  Recently, 
species specifically designed DOP PCR was developed 
enabling more specific amplification of target sequences 
and  minimizing  match  with  bacterial  DNA  at  the  same 
time,  which  can  make  array  CGH  result  more  valid 
(Fiegler eta/., 2003; Chung eta/., 2004). There is a new 
technique minimizing repetitive sequences with  primers 
targeting  for  non-repetitive sequences only (Buckley  et 
a/.,  2002).  Using this approach,  repeat-free sequences 
are  amplified  by  PCR  from  genomic  clones  and  are 
spotted in pools as targets on a slide. DNA copy number 
changes can  also be detected using  arrays made from 
cDNAs  or  oligonucleotides  (Lucito  et  a/.,  2000).  The 
eDNA  arrays  have  proven  their  ability  to  detect  large 
copy number changes  like amplification,  but the  actual 
genomic  resolution  of  the  boundaries  of  single  copy 
number change,  especially focal  single copy change is 
considerably less than that of BAC arrays.

for 

The  resolution  of  BAC  array  has  considerably 
improved  since  the  first  application  of  genome-wide 
array  CGH 
tumor  analysis.  Dumanski  group 
constructed  tile  path  array  for  chromosome  22  and 
analyzed  some  congenital  and  neoplastic  diseases 
(Buckley  eta/.,  2002).  In  2003,  human  BAC array with 
proper  1  Mb  resolution  has  developed  (Fiegler  et  a/., 
2003)  and  recently  full  coverage  tile  path  human  BAC 
array was completed (lshkanian  eta/., 2004).  In  mouse 
study,  Hodgson  et  a/.  applied  mouse  BAC  array  for 
pancreatic  islet  cell  tumor  analysis  (2001).  Cai  et  a/. 
made BAC array with 3 Mb interval (2002) and Chung et 
a/.  improved the resolution to 1 Mb level  (2004). 

Recent  development  of  bioinformatics  tools 

for 
accurate  identification  of  aneuploidy  breakpoint  and 
smoothing  of  A-CGH  data is  another optimistic  sign  of 
further  standardization  and  application  of  A-CGH  for 
medical researches (Jong eta/., 2004; Myers eta/., 2004; 
Wang eta/., 2004). Figure 3 demonstrates the example of 
identification of breakpoint using aCGH-Smooth software 
(Jong  et  a/.,  2004).  Because  of  these  outstanding 
progress of A-CGH technology, more than 150 research 
papers using A-CGH have been published during past 6 
months. 

Applications of A-CGH to medical research 
The  easiest  application  of  A-CGH 
is  detection  of 
multi-copy  gain  of  DNA  extracted  from  homogeneous 
cell  lines.  In this case,  both test and reference cells are 
pure and the test DNA has much more genetic materials 
than  reference. 
In  many  studies  adopting  A-CGH, 
genomic amplification  is  more commonly detected than 
single copy  deletion  (Hodgson  eta/.,  2001;  Snijders  et 
a/., 2001; Cai eta/., 2002; O'Hagan eta/., 2002). Figure 4

represents the precise detection of Ras amplification by 
A-CGH  in  murine mammary tumor.  Detection  of single 
copy  number  change  is  relatively  hard,  especially  in 
narrow  regions.  In  single  copy  deletion,  in  principle, 
signal  intensity  of  test  DNA  is  reduced  50%  than 
reference  DNA;  and  single copy gain  makes  1.5 times 
more intense signal. The result could be obscured due to 
multiple  factors  discussed  below.  Since  the  major 
proportion of human genome is repetitive sequences,  it 
is  important to  block  repetitive  sequences for  reducing 
background  noise  and  obtaining  valid  hybridization 
result  in  genomic DNA arrays comparing  to  expression 
array.  As  well  as  blocking  repetitive sequences,  multiple 
factors 
like  normal  cell  contamination,  non-specific 
interaction  of  labeled  DNA  to  glass  surface,  uneven 
hybridization, washing condition, scanning variation, data 
normalization can affect the result significantly. Therefore, it 
is important to establish adequate controls and arrange 
every  step  carefully  beforehand  to  detect  valid  single 

copy number change. 

1. Application of A-CGH to cancer genomics 
The enhanced  resolution  and  reproducibility  of A-CGH 
compared with chromosome CGH has been demonstrated 
by the fact that A-CGH could find the subtle copy number 
aberrations  that  were  not  detected  by  chromosome 
CGH. For example, in breast cancer, amplification found 
in  20q13.2 and  CYP24 gene was  proved as oncogene 
for breast cancer after analysis (Albertson  eta/., 2000). 
In  neurofibromatosis  type2  patient, 
frequency  and 
boundary of genetic deletion in 22q was found accurately 
by  A-CGH  (Buckley  et  a/.,  2002).  Recently,  genetic 
alterations  in  wide-spectrum  of  tumors  have  been 
analyzed using A-CGH.  Numerous novel amplifications 
have  been  found  in  pancreatic  cancer,  osteosarcoma, 
fallopian  tube  carcinoma,  and  head  and  neck cancers 
(Redon  eta/., 2002;  Snijders  eta/., 2003;  Holzmann et 
a/., 2004; Man eta/., 2004). Whole chromosome profiling 
of  lymphomas  and  gastrointestinal  tumors  were  also 
comprehensively analyzed (De Leeuw eta/., 2004; Peng 
eta/., 2004).  A-CGH can be used to analyze genome(cid:173)
widely for each stage of tumor genesis. 

Animal  disease  models  are  actively  studied  using 
A-CGH. Deletions in chromosomes 6, 8, and 4 (12p11-p13, 
16q24.3,  13q11-32  in  human)  and  amplifications  in 
chromosomes  2  and  4  (20q13.2,  1 p32-36  in  human) 
were  found  by  A-CGH  in  mouse  pancreatic  islet  cell 
tumor. Among genes in these regions, there are several 
candidates for tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes 
like  CYP24,  PFDN4,  STMN1, CDK1B,  PPP2R3  and 
FSTL1  (Hodgson  eta/.,  2001).  The  genomic  instability 
affected  by telomere  dysfunction  was  studied  in  colon 
and  breast  cancers  by  using  A-CGH  (O'Hagan  eta/.,

2002).  As  a  result,  minimal  amplification  region  (MAR) 
was found and regional amplification or loss induced by 
nonreciprocal translocation due to telomere dysfunction 
proved  to  be  one  of  the  important  tumorigenesis 
mechanisms.  A-CGH  analysis  of  murine neurolastoma 
revealed  important  ideas  to  understand  human  tumor 
progression (Hackett et at.,  2003). 

2.  Application of A-CGH to unknown congenital 

genetic disease 

It is well-known that a variety of quantitative changes in 
genetic material underlie many congenital anomalies or 
mental  retardations.  In  practice,  several  cytogenetic 
techniques have been used to diagnose these disorders. 
If the genetic changes are already identified, we can use 
karyotyping  or  FISH  to  confirm  genetic  abnormalities 
such as aneuploidy,  regional  loss or gain, translocation. 
But, there is a limitation to use existing molecular genetic 
techniques 
for  detecting  novel  or  subtle  changes 
because of technical difficulties as we mentioned before. 
Even though causative genetic abnormalities for several 
congenital  diseases  like  Down  syndrome  are  already 
found,  genetic  changes  causing  most  of  congenital 
anomalies  and  mental  retardation  are  still 
largely 
unknown.  There  are  evidences  that  submicroscopic 
telomeric rearrangement is related with mental retardation. 
Also  the  role  of  subtelomeric  rearrangement  has  been 
revealed  directly  and  indirectly,  but  not  fully  proven. 
Recent researches using A-CGH for congenital diseases 
have  been  finding  clinically  important  information.  For 
example,  new A-CGH  designed to analyze telomeric or 

interesting  cryptic 

subtelomeric region is now being used for studying some 
idiopathic  mental  retardation  (Veltman  et  a/.,  2002; 
Knight eta/., 2000). A-CGH not only confirmed previous 
hypotheses  for  mental  retardations  of  unknown  origin, 
but  also  found  novel  changes  (Veltman  eta/.,  2002). 
Indeed  several 
rearrangement, 
deletions, or duplications were detected in subtelomeric 
region  of chromosome  1,  4,  9,  15  in  idiopathic  mental 
retardation (Harada eta/., 2004; Shaw-Smith eta/., 2004). 
Other  types  of  complex  neurobehavioral  disorders  or 
unknown  spontaneous  miscarriage  were  also  studied 
using A-CGH,  revealed some causative rearrangements 
or imbalances (Schaeffer eta/., 2004; Wang eta/, 2004). 
Even though this field is relatively new and it needs more 
improvement,  A-CGH  based  genetic  diagnosis  will 
become  clinically  important.  To  see  more  examples, 
A-CGH revealed the deletion boundary around 22q11.2, 
known  as  an  important  region  for  DiGeorge  syndrome 
(Snijders et at., 2001 ). A-CGH have uncovered important 
changes for cardia-facio-cutaneous syndrome and other 
congenital disorders like congenital aural atresia (Rauen 
eta/., 2002; Veltman eta/., 2002; Gunn eta/., 2003). 

Prospects of A-CGH for biomedical 
research 
CGH  is  expected  to  contribute  to  biomedical  study 
enormously.  Cancers  are  caused  by  multiple  genetic 
changes sporadically as well as congenitally. It has been 
widely  accepted that on or off of  a single gene cannot 
explain  complicated  processes  of 
initiation,

development or metastasis. To understand the complex 
network  of  genetic  alterations  from  single  genes  to 
genome, in addition to global gene expression profiling, 
one  of  the  key  information  will  be  comprehensive 
chromosome  aberration  data.  To 
genome-wide 
overcome the  limitations of A-CGH  such  as tumor cell 
purity or isolation of single tumor clone, microdissection 
based  A-CGH  analysis  can  be  more  useful.  This 
microdissection and whole genome amplification based 
approach  is  already  applied  as  an  alternative  way  to 
increase the tumor cell purity and to use extremely small 
number  of  cells  for  A-CGH.  Using  A-CGH  we  can 
understand  more  about  idiopathic  genetic  diseases, 
psychiatric  diseases,  and  metabolic  disorders.  There 
have been evidences of chromosomal alterations in type 
1  diabetes mellitus and autoimmune disease like  SLE. 
Ultimately,  as  shown  in  figure  5,  we  hope  to  use  the 
accumulated A-CGH database to predict these diseases 
in younger age and prevent them.
