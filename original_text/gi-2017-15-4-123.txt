Synonymous  sites  are  generally  considered  to  be  functionally  neutral.  However,  there  are  recent  contradictory  findings 
suggesting that synonymous alleles might have functional roles in various molecular aspects. For instance, a recent study 
demonstrated  that  synonymous  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  have  a  similar  effect  size  as  nonsynonymous  single 
nucleotide polymorphisms in human disease association studies. Researchers have recognized synonymous codon usage bias 
(SCUB) in the genomes of almost all species and have investigated whether SCUB is due to random nucleotide compositional 
bias or to natural selection of any functional exposure generated by synonymous mutations. One of the most prominent 
observations on the non-neutrality of synonymous codons is the correlation between SCUB and levels of gene expression, 
such that highly expressed genes tend to have a higher preference toward so-called optimal codons than lowly expressed 
genes. In relation, it is known that amounts of cognate tRNAs that bind to optimal codons are significantly higher than the 
amounts of cognate tRNAs that bind to non-optimal codons in genomes. In the present paper, we review various functions 
that synonymous codons might have other than regulating expression levels.

Keywords: optimal codon, single nucleotide polymorphism, synonymous codon usage bias

Introduction

According  to  the  molecular  evolutionary  theory,  muta-
tions  occurring  in  coding  regions  involved  in  amino  acid 
changes,  called  nonsynonymous  mutations,  are  basically 
harmful  and  deleterious  to  organisms  and  are  subject  to 
strong purifying selection [1]. Changes in amino acids in 
protein  sequences  by  any  type  of  mutation—particularly, 
changes  from  original  or  ancestral  amino  acids  into  new 
amino acids with very different physicochemical properties
—can  cause  severe  problems  in  protein  structure  and 
function [2]. In contrast, mutations in coding regions but 
not related to amino acid changes are called synonymous 
mutations and are generally considered to be functionally 
neutral [3-5]. In fact, most recent research on identifying 
disease-causing  variants  in  genetic  diseases,  including 
Mendelian diseases and common complex diseases, such as 
diabetes  and  cancers,  has  been  focusing  on  searching  for 
nonsynonymous variants [6-12]. In most of these studies, 

synonymous variants have been ignored and even filtered 
out  for  further  functional  validation  processes.  Another 
difficulty in studying synonymous variants is that there are 
no  good  or  established  tests  for  functional  synonymous 
codons.

One clue suggesting the non-neutrality of synonymous 
codons  could  be  drawn  from  the  study  on  synonymous 
codon usage bias (SCUB) [13-15]. SCUB means that the 
uses of synonymous codons involved in encoding the same 
amino acids are not equivalent to each other, depending on 
the kinds of proteins or the species carrying those proteins. 
In other words, different proteins in different species have 
different synonymous codon preferences when determining 
amino  acids  [15,  16].  No  such  biased  codon  preference 
among different synonymous codons is expected under the 
assumption of the neutrality of synonymous codons. Resear-
chers have been recognizing this intriguing phenomenon for 
a long time and trying to figure out what factors lead to SCUB 
[17].

Two  different  explanations  have  been  provided  so  far

about what causes the SCUB phenomenon. One is based on 
uneven nucleotide compositions throughout genomes [18]. 
Simply, the research groups supporting the idea of biased 
nucleotide compositions think that genes located in genomic 
regions with abundant G or C content tend to prefer codons 
with G- or C-endings [19]. Consistently, it has been observed 
that  there  is  a  correspondence  of  G/C  content  between 
introns  and  exons  in  mammals,  which  means  that  genes 
harboring introns with higher G/C content are likely to carry 
exons with higher G/C content. The second scenario posits 
that SCUB is basically a consequence of natural selection of 
the  roles  of  synonymous  codons  in  the  regulation  of  the 
expression of genes [20-22]. The research groups suppor-
ting the second scenario insist that genes with higher levels 
of  expression  are  expected  to  have  higher  evolutionary 
constraints  on  the  requirement  of  codons  necessary  for 
improving translational efficiency and accuracy than genes 
with lower levels of expression [23, 24]. In fact, numerous 
studies have shown that the codon usage of highly expressed 
genes is biased toward optimal codons than lowly expressed 
genes and that this biased usage is linked to the enhance-
ment  of  translational  speed  and  accuracy  [25,  26].  In 
relation, the amounts of cognate tRNAs carrying anticodons 
are higher against optimal codons than against non-optimal 
codons. 

An evolutionary explanation of SCUB, based on natural 
selection,  was  investigated  under  a  hypothesis,  called 
Hill-Robertson (HR) interference. The HR hypothesis posits 
that the efficiency of natural selection of one site will weaken 
when  the  site  is  linked  to  adjacent  sites  and  does  not 
segregate independently, wherein recombination can play a 
role in relieving the interference. There is some agreement 
among researchers that SCUB is positively correlated with 
recombination  rates,  although  there  are  opposite  obser-
vations on the effect of HR [27-29].

In the present work, we thus decided to summarize other 
facets of the functions that synonymous codons might have, 
other  than  the  functions  that  are  related  to  translational 
efficiency and accuracy in the regulation of gene expression 
(Fig. 1).

Results
Function of nonoptimal codons

SCUB is considered to be a general phenomenon that can 
be observed in the genomes of almost all species [13-15]. 
However, patterns of SCUB are not equivalent to each other 
among different genomes in different species. Some genomes 
have a higher preference toward optimal codons, while other 
genomes do not show this preference [13]. The amounts of 
optimal codons vary, depending on the kinds of genes [13]. 

SCUB  patterns  in  genomes  are  more  similar  in  closely 
related species than in distantly related species [30]. Under 
the natural selection scenario, genes with low levels of bias 
in codon usage are generally thought to be the result of a lack 
of natural selection toward optimal codons. 

However,  some  researchers  have  tried  to  provide  an 
opposing  explanation  regarding  why  some  genes  avoid 
optimal codons within genes. They think that genes tend to 
harbor codons that are rarely used in translation, because 
rare codons are beneficial in checking the step right before 
ribosomes start translation or the protein folding step before 
secreting  nascent  protein  product  in  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum [31, 32]. Additionally, recently, Zhou et al. (2013) 
[33] provided another interesting observation in Neurospora, 
suggesting that the usage of non-optimal codons in the Frq 
gene is essential in regulating circadian rhythms .

Splicing regulation

Intron-exon boundary regions, also known as limited by 
the  GU-AG  rule,  are  important  in  carrying  out  splicing 
events  [34].  Additionally,  potential  splicing  enhancers 
(ESEs) or splicing silencers residing near intron-exon boun-
daries—i.e.,  DNA  sequence  motifs  within  an  exon—are 
known to enhance or suppress splicing. Thus, some synony-
mous codons can participate as constituents of these motifs. 
Therefore, a synonymous mutation of a gene can affect the 
splicing of that gene, without any influence on amino acid 
changes  in  that  gene.  In  fact,  Takahashi  (2009)  [35]  has 
shown in Drosophila that translationally optimal codons tend 
to be avoided within the ESE motifs, and compared codon 
usage biases of exons with those of ESE regions in the Down 
syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) gene using codon 
bias indices, called CBI [35, 36]. Dscam is known as one of the 
genes with the largest number of alternatively spliced exons 
[35]. Furthermore, another study showed that almost none 
of the synonymous codons residing in ESEs was an optimal

codon in the regulation of translational efficiency [37]. The 
same  study  showed  that  this  conflict  on  the  roles  of 
synonymous codons between translational regulation and 
splicing control was larger in highly expressed genes [37].

Regulation in transcription

It is quite unexpected that synonymous codons are some-
how linked to the regulation of transcription. Transcription 
is a process of copying genic sequences into mRNAs, which 
requires  various  specific  and  delicate  controls,  usually 
conducted by the combinatorial actions of cis-acting DNA 
elements and transacting regulatory factors, called transcrip-
tion  factors  (TFs).  Promoters  are  well-established  con-
trolling  cis-acting  elements  and  are  generally  located  up-
stream of transcription start sites, which are thought to be 
separate regions from the coding regions of genes. 

Recently, Stergachis et al. (2013) [38] reported a surprising 
observation that approximately 15% of coding regions play 
roles both as coding sequences for determining amino acids 
and, astonishingly, as TF binding sites, by DNase footprint 
analysis in more than 80 different human cell types. Addi-
tionally,  according  to  the  paper,  synonymous  codon  sites 
with  dual  functions  are  evolutionarily  conserved,  the 
binding sites of TFs recognizing stop codons are selectively 
depleted,  and  single-nucleotide  variants  residing  within 
synonymous codons with dual functions can alter TF binding 
[38]. Therefore, it is plausible that mutations in synony-
mous sites can lead to obstruction of normal transcription, 
despite no amino acid alterations being driven.

Regulation of RNA secondary structure

The  secondary  structure  of  mRNA  is  important  for 
controlling translational speed and timing, on which syno-
nymous  codon  mutations  might  have  crucial  effects.  For 
instance,  removing  rare  synonymous  codons  from  an 
expression  construct  decreases  the  enzyme  activity  of 
chloramphenicol  acetyltransferase  [15],  which  is  due  to 
alteration of the mRNA secondary structure by the removal 
of rare codons. The secondary structure of mRNA is also 
known to be associated with ribosome pausing,  which is 
important for the formation of correct protein folding for 
insertion into the lipid bilayer in yeast [39]. 

The same observation has also been made in Escherichia 
coli,  such  that  the  translational  rate  is  influenced  by  the 
protein folding efficiency and that the folding efficiency is 
associated with an abundance of codons with a low concen-
tration  of  cognate  tRNAs.  Consistently,  Zhou  et  al.  [40] 
found that optimal codons for high efficiency of expression 
are located in structurally sensitive sites in proteins. Zhang 
et al. [41] also demonstrated that synonymous codon muta-
tions significantly perturb folding efficiency. Saunders and 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

Deane  [42]  observed  that  synonymous  codon  usage  is 
related  to  the  secondary  structure  of  local  mRNA.  All  of 
these studies consistently suggest that synonymous codons 
might  be  involved  in  the  formation  of  mRNA  secondary 
structures that, ultimately, control translational speed and 
timing. 

Conclusion

Researchers have long been searching for important dis-
ease-associated variants, mainly by investigating functional 
perturbations caused by nonsynonymous mutations. On the 
other hand, synonymous mutations have not been consi-
dered to be variants that are responsible for showing disease 
phenotypes. Often, synonymous mutations are filtered out 
and  are  not  even  considered,  because  candidate  variants 
need  to  be  functionally  validated  for  the  possibility  of 
causing  diseases  or  phenotypes.  In  that  sense,  it  is  an 
interesting  revelation  that  there  are  various  functional 
activities  conducted  by  synonymous  codons  in  molecular 
processes. Synonymous mutations do not change the amino 
acid sequence in proteins but can interrupt the formation of 
correct  mRNA  secondary  structures,  reduce  translational 
accuracy and speed, and even alter the start of transcription. 
We think that advancing our understanding of the functions 
of synonymous codons will contribute to the identification 
of all disease-associated genes and mutations.
