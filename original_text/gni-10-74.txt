Most genes are processed by alternative splicing for gene expression, resulting in the complexity of the transcriptome in 
eukaryotes. It allows a limited number of genes to encode various proteins with intricate functions. Alternative splicing is 
regulated by genetic mutations in cis-regulatory factors and epigenetic events. Furthermore, splicing events occur differently 
according  to  cell  type,  developmental  stage,  and  various  diseases,  including  cancer.  Genome  instability  and  flexible 
proteomes by alternative splicing could affect cancer cells to grow and survive, leading to metastasis. Cancer cells that are 
transformed by aberrant and uncontrolled mechanisms could produce alternative splicing to maintain and spread them 
continuously. Splicing variants in various cancers represent crucial roles for tumorigenesis. Taken together, the identification 
of  alternative  spliced  variants  as  biomarkers  to  distinguish  between  normal  and  cancer  cells  could  cast  light  on 
tumorigenesis.

Introduction

Genes are transcribed into pre-mRNA and pass through 
splicing as a post-transcriptional modification to generate 
mature mRNA for translation [1]. Splicing is an essential 
process  for  gene  expression  in  eukaryotes,  eliminating 
introns  and  joining  the  exons,  which  occurs  in  the 
spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins 
(snRNPs) and other proteins [2]. This splicing can generate 
alternative spliced transcripts from pre-mRNA and different 
exon constitutions, resulting in different proteins. Alternative 
splicing can occur in different ways. The most representative 
mechanisms are as follows: 1, extending or shortening the 
exon  by  alternative  donor  and  acceptor  sites;  2,  exon 
skipping; 3, mutual exon exclusion; and 4, intron retention 
[1, 3, 4]. These mechanisms allow protein isoforms with 
different biological characters to be produced from single 
genes [1]. Therefore, complex transcriptomes and proteomes 
could  be  derived  from  a  limited  number  of  genes  [4]. 
Namely, this process is an important strategy for the com-
plicated regulation of eukaryotes, and most genes (92-95%) 
undergo this process [5, 6]. 

Alternative  splicing  is  regulated  according  to  cell  type, 
developmental  stage,  and  disease  states  [1,  7,  8].  Bio-
chemical mechanisms for the recognition of splice sites are 
not understood clearly according to cellular conditions, but 
some  tissue-specific  factors  participate  in  alternative 
splicing  [4].  In  addition,  quantitative  gene  expression  is 
controlled  by  nonsense-mediated  decay  mechanisms  that 
degrade targeting mRNAs, producing nonsense mutations. 
Thus,  truncated  or  erroneous  proteins  with  abnormal 
functions  are  prevented  from  being  expressed  [9].  Alter-
native  transcripts  could  be  related  to  various  diseases, 
including  cancer.  As  many  as  50%  of  genetic  diseases  of 
humans are related to mutations in splice site sequences and 
regulatory elements, such enhancers and silencers, resulting 
in alternative exon constitution [3, 10, 11]. Recently, the 
SpliceDisease database, providing information for relation-
ships among gene mutation, splicing defects, and diseases, 
was reported [12]. Especially, aberrent spliced variants are 
found frequently in cancer, indicating that they could play a 
role for the survival of cancer cells [8]. Alternative splicing of 
cancer-related  genes  could  affect  cell  cycle  control,  signal 
transduction  pathways,  apoptosis,  angiogenesis,  invasion,

and metastasis [8, 13].

Cancer markers allow us to determine the prognosis and 
therapy for cancer during the remedy of cancer. Thus, the 
identification of cancer markers is highlighted in the cancer 
research field [14]. Cancers result from the accumulation of 
complex genetic and epigenetic alterations against normal 
regulation. Cancerous cells grow irregularly, create malig-
nant tumors, and move to the other parts of the body. Their 
alternative spliced transcripts could be detected with cryptic 
splicing sites. Accordingly, alternative transcripts produced 
by  splicing  events  represent  good  candidates  for  cancer 
biomarkers [7, 8, 13]. In the present review, we summarize 
and discuss the alternative splicing events and their potential 
as cancer biomarkers. 

Genetic and Epigenetic Regulation of 
Alternative Splicing

Alternative  splicing  is  an  essential  post-transcriptional 
process for creating various protein isoforms from the same 
gene. Approximately 60% of human genes have at least one 
alternative  splice  transcript  [15].  Alternative  splicing  is 
regulated by mutations in genetic regions [3, 7, 14]. Most 

exons are flanked by the intronic dinucleotides GT (donor 
site) and AG (acceptor site), which are recognized by the 
spliceosome (Fig. 1A). Pre-mRNA is reconstructed only by 
joined  exons  with  the  removal  of  introns.  However, 
mutations  of  these  splice  sites  lead  to  aberrant  splicing, 
producing exon skipping and different joining of exons to 
truncated or nonfunctional or dysfunctional proteins. It was 
reported that mutations of splice sites may play important 
roles  in  human  disease,  and  longer  proteins  also  tend  to 
associate to various disease [16, 17].

In the case of the PAX6 gene, a 5' splice site mutation in 
intron 12 induces exon skipping in relation to autosomal 
dominant aniridia [18]. In the APC gene, abnormal splicing 
by a 3' splice site mutation in intron 3 causes exon 4 skipping 
due to a frameshift in hepatoblastoma [19]. A mutation in 
intron 25 of the ABCA3 gene creates novel 5' splice sites [20]. 
The spliceosome is known to recognize cryptic splice sites 
instead of typical splice sites. Noncanonical splice sites are 
GC-AG, GG-AG, GT-TG, GT-CG, AT-AG, GA-AG, GT- AC, 
and  CT-AG  (5'-3'  splice  sites)  [21-23].  Mutations  at  the 
noncanonical splice site of the SEDL gene cause variants in 
X-linked  spondyloepiphyseal  dysplasia  tarda  [24].  Addi-
tionally, less exon skipping and more intron retention by 

Fig. 1. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of alternative splicing. (A) Most genes are spliced by typical splice sites (GT-AG) and regulatory
sequences  in  exons  (ESS  and  ESE)  and  introns  (ISS  and  ISE).  Mutations  (*)  generate  alternative  splicing,  resulting  in  various  transcripts 
from  a  single  gene.  (B)  H3K36me3  marking  in  exons  is  found  in  weakly  expressed  alternatively  spliced  exons  (grey  thin  dotted  line), 
and H3K4me3 marks are rich in spliced exons (black thick dotted line), indicating that histone modification has a relation to transcription 
via  splicing-related  marking  mechanisms.  Additionally,  hisone  acethylation  could  modulate  splicing  rates  to  react  quickly  to  changing 
conditions with increased RNA polymerase II processivity, and spliceosome rearrangements are affected by histone acetylation. High levels 
of  CG  have  a  tendency  not  to  be  spliced  (grey  line  in  intron),  and  exon  skipping  is  in  the  lower  level  of  both  CG  and  mCG  in  exonic 
regions. Methylation of exon inhibits binding of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), leading to exon skipping. ESE, exonic splicing enhancers;

alternative splice sites are observed in cancer tissue com-
pared  to  normal  tissues  from  an  analysis  of  expression 
sequence tags (ESTs) [25]. As a mutation of pre-mRNA, A to 
I RNA editing (conversion adenosine to inosine from dea-
mination)  also  affects  transcriptome  diversification.  RNA 
editing has regulatory roles, such as altering splice sites and 
sequences  necessary  for  recognition  of  the  spliceosome, 
resulting in modulation of alternatively spliced transcripts 
[26]. The last case of alternative splicing is by cis-genomic 
mutations in regulatory factors, such as branch sites, exonic 
and intronic splicing enhancers, and silencers [7, 27]. Pre- 
mRNA has exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs, 
ISEs) and silencers (ESSs, ISSs) that promote exon inclusion 
and  exclusion  by  regulation  of  splice  site  recognition, 
respectively (Fig. 1A). The arginine-serine-rich (SR) protein 
that binds to ESEs induces splicing via a helping assembly 
spliceosome  by  interacting  with  snRNP.  On  the  contrary, 
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein is bound to ESEs 
and  ISEs  and  inhibits  splice  site  recognition  by  blocking 
spliceosome assembly [15, 27-29]. Mutations in regulatory 
factor  could  disturb  the  binding  of  these  spliceosome 
assembly-related proteins. Mutations at nucleotide positions 
57 and 58 of the 174-bp-long exon 7 cause exon 7 skipping as 
a  result  of  aberrant  splicing  by  interrupted  ESE-specific 
consensus sequences that are recognized by the SC35 and 
SF2/ASF SR proteins [10, 30]. Additionally, Ron, encoding 
the  tyrosine  kinase  receptor  for  macrophage-stimulating 
protein, has alternative splice transcripts. It is regulated by 
overexpression of SF2/ASF binding to ESE and ISE in colon 
and breast cancer [31].

Alternative  splicing  is  also  known  to  be  affected  by 
epigenetic  regulation,  such  as  DNA  methylation,  histone 
modification,  and  chromatin  structure  (Fig.  1B).  The  re-
lationship  between  chromatin  structure  and  alternative 
splicing is still in a maze, but association studies are gradually 
increasing genomewide [32-34]. Hisone modifications are 
enriched in exons rather than introns and related to exon 
expression, especially H3K36me3, H3K79me1, H2BK5me1, 
H3K27me1, H3K27me2, and H3K27me3 [35, 36]. H3K36me3 
marking in exons is found in weakly expressed, alternatively 
spliced  exons,  indicating  that  histone  modification  has  a 
relation to transcription via splicing-related marking mecha-
nisms [36, 37]. These histone marks could recruit splicing 
regulators  with  chromatin  binding  proteins  and  affect 
mRNA splicing [33]. Additionally, hisone acethylation could 
modulate splicing rates to react quickly to changing con-
ditions with increased RNA polymerase II processivity, and 
spliceosome rearrangements are affected by histone acety-
lation [38]. Nevertheless, although there is little evidence, 
DNA methylation has been reported to have a relationship 
with splice sites. CpG dinucleotides are distributed nonran-

domly in the genome. Exon skipping and mutually exclusive 
exons have significantly lower levels of both CG and mCG in 
the  exonic  regions,  whereas  intron  retention  has  signifi-
cantly higher levels of CG in both exonic and intronic regions 
[34].  A  DNA-binding  protein,  CCCTC-binding  factor 
(CTCF), was inhibited by a methylation event of CD45 exon 
5  [39].  These  epigenetic  features  are  strongly  associated 
with alternative splicing. Furthermore, these mechanisms 
are known to be changed according to cell type and disease 
states.  Especially,  in  cancer,  the  epigenetic  regulation  of 
chromatin  structure  effects  aberrant  gene  expression  by 
alternative splicing in cancer [1, 7, 8]. 

Taken together, gene expression via alternative splicing is 
altered  by  complicated  and  mutual  mechanisms,  from 
genetic to epigenetic regulation. Therefore, it casts light on 
the understanding of cancer mechanisms by an investigation 
of alternative splicing patterns.

Alternative Splicing in Cancer

A number of studies have been reported that alternative 
splicing is related closely to development, cellular stress, and 
various diseases, including cancer, as a crucial contributor to 
transcriptome and proteome diversity [1, 7, 8, 14]. In cancer, 
with increasing genomic instability, sequence substitution 
and aberrant alternative splicing occur frequently, leading to 
erroneous and dysfunctional proteins [14]. Protein isoforms 
made from this process are developmentally regulated and 
preferentially re-expressed in cancer and help the differen-
tiation and survival of cancer cells (Fig. 2). The development 

Fig. 2. Roles of alternative splicing in cancer. Dysfunctional proteins
are generated by alternative splicing in cancer-related genes (onco-
genic and tumor suppressor genes), increasing genomic instability.
These  aberrant  proteins  help  cancerous  cells  to  promote  their 
growth, proliferation, and metastasis continuously (tumorigenesis).
Variants of cancer-related genes expressed specifically or differently
with  their  crucial  roles  for  tumorigenesis  could  be  potential 
biomarkers  to  distinguish  between  normal  and  cancer  cells.

of genomewide analysis allows large-scale examination of 
the  relationship  between  alternative  splicing  and  tumori-
genesis [40, 41]. Every case of alternative splicing is reported 
in  cancer;  among  these,  the  most  frequent  case  is  the 
mutually exclusive exon [14]. For example, overexpression 
of  CD44,  involved  in  cell  proliferation,  differentiation, 
migration, and alternative splicing, by different splice sites of 
CD44 during tumorigenesis indicates that it could play roles 
in  tumor  cell  invasion  and  metastasis  [42-45].  Tumor 
suppressor genes, such as p53 and PTEN (Phosphatase and 
Tensin  homolog,  deleted  on  chromosome  TEN),  have 
splicing  variants  associated  to  cancer  [46].  p53  protein 
isoforms through alternative splicing have critical roles in 
many  biological  processes,  indicating  that  dysregulation 
effects tumorigenesis [47]. Different expression  of PTEN 
and its alternatively spliced transcripts are found to vary in 
different tissue types. PTEN regulates p53 stability and in 
turn  regulates  its  own  transcriptional  activity.  The  PTEN 
splice variants retained in intron 3 region and intron 5 region 
have been found in breast cancer [46]. In the case of the APC 
gene, aberrant splice skipping of exon 4, created by insertion 
of  T  in  intron  4,  is  involved  in  colon  cancer  [48].  An 
alternative 5' splice site in BCL-X results in 2 isoforms, long 
and  short  (Bcl-x  (L),  Bcl-x  (X)),  which  have  contrasting 

functions  related  to  apoptosis  and  are  overexpressed  in 
various tumors [49, 50]. Although specific roles of vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms are not known 
exactly, among the isoforms of VEGF4 involved in formation 
of  new  vessels,  VEGF165  and  VEGF165b,  created  by  an 
alternative 3' splice site, have different expression in cancer 
[51, 52]. Over 40 different MDM2 transcripts are identified 
in normal and cancer by alternative 5' and 3' splice sites. They 
mostly  lose  the  p53  binding  domain  and  promote  tumor 
progression  and  affect  prognosis  independently  [53,  54]. 
Increasing  number  of  reports  have  demonstrated  the 
expression of aberrant and abnormal splice variants in cancer 
cells or tissues. However, it is not enough evidence for a 
functional  relationship  between  alternative  splicing  and 
cancer.  Hallmarks  of  the  initiation  and  early  growth  of 
cancers during tumor progression using large-scale analyses 
of splicing variants in the cancer EST database are needed as 
new RNA prognosis markers.

tion (Fig. 2). For this reason, many studies have made an 
effort to identify specific features and regulation mechanims 
of  various  diseases,  including  cancer.  It  is  important  and 
necessary to identify cancer markers to be able to distinguish 
between cancer and normal cells. Cancer markers could be 
very helpful in understanding tumorigenesis and developing 
tumor targets for therapeutic intervention. However, there 
still  remain  unsolved  problems  in  spite  of  a  number  of 
studies [7, 14, 45, 64]. From this point of view, alternatively 
spliced transcripts by mutation and cryptic splice site altered 
expression  levels  in  cancer  have  emerged  as  strong  can-
didates of cancer biomarker at the mRNA and protein level 
[7]. As written previously, some alternative transcripts of 
several genes, CD44, p53, PTEN, BCL-X, VEGF4, and MDM2, 
have been discovered (see also Table 1) [43, 46, 49, 50, 52, 
54]. They are also associated with various cancers directly or 
indirectly. Recently, the discovery of biomarkers has impro-
ved  by  genomewide  analysis  [13,  65,  66].  It  could  be 
expected to provide valuable information for the association 
between alternative splice variants and cancers. Thus, novel 
candidate variants could contribute to the development of 
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic markers. 

Conclusion

RNA  splicing  is  a  core  mechanism  to  generate  mature 
mRNA for translation, and alternative splicing is an indis-
pensable mechanism, stratgically leading to protein diversity 
for complicated regulation in eukaryotes. In cancer, alter-
native splicing is more flexible, leading various proteins with 
aberrant  functions  to  promote  growth  and  the  spread  of 
cancer cells. It is important to identify alternative transcripts 
that function specifically in cancer. These alternative trans-
cripts could be used not only as diagnostic biomarkers but 
also prognostic and theraputic biomarkers. Therefore, studies 
on genetic and epigenetic regulation in relation to alternative 
splice variants in cancer could open new windows of research 
in answering unsolved questions of tumorigenesis.
