The alteration of alternative splicing patterns has an effect on the quantification of functional proteins, leading to phenotype 
variation. The splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) is one of the main genetic elements affecting splicing patterns. Here, we 
report the results of genome-wide sQTLs across 141 strains of Arabidopsis thaliana with publicly available next generation 
sequencing datasets. As a result, we found 1,694 candidate sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana at a false discovery rate of 0.01. 
Furthermore,  among  the  candidate  sQTLs,  we  found  25  sQTLs  that  overlapped  with  the  list  of  previously  examined 
trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In summary, this sQTL analysis provides new insight into genetic 
elements  affecting  alternative  splicing  patterns  in  Arabidopsis  thaliana  and  the  mechanism  of  previously  reported 
trait-associated SNPs.

Introduction

Arabidopsis  thaliana  is  a  metaphyte  and  angiosperm 
growing in Europe, Asia, and Africa. This is a small plant that 
is one of the widely popular model organisms, because this 
plant has a small genome and can be cultivated easily. Thus, 
much genetic research has been carried out with Arabidopsis 
thaliana  [1,  2].  Recently,  in  Arabidopsis  thaliana,  genetic 
components  associated  with  traits  or  diseases  have  been 
reported through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
studies [3]. The GWAS is a powerful approach to discover 
genetic elements associated with various traits. The GWAS 
was based on 107 phenotypes. This can be grouped into 4 
categories: 23 flowering, 23 defense, 18 ionomics, and 43 
development traits. Although GWASs have been successful, 
the molecular mechanisms of genetic elements discovered 
through the GWAS have been elusive [4]. The molecular 
mechanisms of previously reported trait-associated single 
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  Arabidopsis  thaliana 
have  been  also  elusive.  Expression  quantitative  trait  loci 
(eQTLs)  influencing  gene  expression  levels  and  splicing 
quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) changing alternative splicing 
patterns are useful genetic elements to explain the trait-as-

sociated SNPs. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there have been many 
studies  to  identify  eQTLs,  and  these  accumulated  eQTLs 
have been greatly helpful for explaining trait-associated loci 
[5-7].  However,  there  have  been  few  studies  of  the 
genome-wide investigation of sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
Since  sQTLs  can  change  alternative  splicing  patterns  and 
consequently  affect  various  traits,  those  sQTLs  can  con-
stitute crucial elements for the interpretation of trait-asso-
ciated SNPs [8]. Here, we discover candidate genome-wide 
sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana using the IVAS package, which 
is  a  user-friendly  R/Bioconductor  package,  to  discover 
sQTLs with genotypes and fragments per kilobase million 
(FPKM) of a transcript dataset [9]. We analyzed 141 pre-
viously published matched genotype data and an RNA-seq 
dataset downloaded in the 1001 Genomes Data Center [10] 
and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database [11], 
respectively.  To  obtain  the  FPKM  of  transcripts,  we  pro-
cessed and aligned raw RNA-seq data. As a result of the 
discovery using IVAS, we identified 1,694 SNPs. Further-
more, among those SNPs, we found 96 candidate sQTLs that 
overlapped with the list of previously published trait-asso-
ciated loci [3], and of 96 sQTLs, 25 sQTLs that led to a large 
difference in expression ratio of alternatively targeted exons 
across  genotypes  of  each  sQTL  were  finally  selected.  In

summary, we reported 1,694 genome-wide sQTLs and 25 
candidate trait-associated sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana. This 
list of those sQTLs may be a useful dataset for sQTL utilities 
in Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as its neighboring species.

Methods
The overall pipeline 

An overview of our research is given in Fig. 1. We down-
loaded genotype and RNA-seq datasets measured in Ara-
bidopsis thaliana from the 1001 Genomes Data Center [10] 
and the GEO database (GSE43858) [11]. The genotype and 
RNA-seq datasets include 171 and 160 strains, respectively. 
Among them, we selected a matched dataset of 141 strains. 
The raw RNA-seq data were filtered by quality control and 
mapped to a reference sequence using SHRiMP2 software, 
which is an alignment tool for high accuracy and sensitivity 
at a very reasonable speed [12]. An average mapping rate was 
about 80%. After mapping to the reference sequence, we 
filtered out mapped reads with low mapping quality using 
Samtools [13]. In order to obtain FPKM values, we estimated 
quantifications  from  mapped  reads  using  Cufflinks  [14] 
with the reference GTF file downloaded from the Ensembl 
Genomes  website.  With  the  preprocessed  genotype  and 
RNA-seq datasets, we carried out IVAS for the discovery of 
genome-wide  sQTLs.  Afterwards,  we  found  candidate 
sQTLs that overlapped with trait-associated loci in the list of 
the 107 phenotypes database [3]. 

Association test for identification of genome-wide 
sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana

In order to discover genome-wide sQTLs in Arabidopsis 
thaliana, we carried out an association test using the IVAS 
package [9]. For each exon with at least two isoforms, IVAS 
tested associations between the alternatively targeted exon 
and the genotype of SNPs located in the exon and flanking 
introns.  We  filtered  the  result  based  on  a  cutoff  at  false 

discovery rate (FDR) = 0.01 and median values of exon ratio 
across each genotype ＞ 0.1. 

Interpretation of trait-associated SNPs with candidate 
sQTLs

We downloaded the list of loci associated with the 107 
phenotypes of 4 categories [3] (p < 0.05). We identified and 
tabulated  the  trait-associated  loci  overlapping  with  the 
candidate sQTLs obtained by IVAS. In order to yield a more 
biologically meaningful result, we kept those trait-associated 
sQTLs achieving a high differential expression ratio of an 
alternatively targeted exon across genotypes of each sQTL 
(the third quantile of exon ratios of one genotype ＞ the first 
quantile of exon ratios of the other genotype).

Results
Processing for the genotype and RNA-seq datasets

We  downloaded  a  genotype  dataset  in  1001  Genomes 
Data  Center  [10]  and  an  RNA-seq  dataset  in  the  GEO 
database (GSE43858) [11] in order to identify genome-wide 
sQTLs  in  Arabidopsis  thaliana.  In  order  to  increase  the 
accuracy of the mapping of RNA-seq reads, we manually 
filtered  out  low-quality  reads  and  aligned  them  to  the 
Arabidopsis  thaliana  reference  genome.  The  aligned  reads 
were estimated by Cufflinks [14]. As a result, we obtained 
and  analyzed  the  quantifications  of  41,621  isoforms  and 
5,833,535 SNP markers of the 141 matched strains. 

Discovery of sQTLs in Arabidopsis thaliana

Using the IVAS package [9], we analyzed the preprocessed 
dataset. For each alternatively spliced exon, we carried out an 
association  test  between  a  given  exon  expression  and 
genotype of an SNP located in the given exon and flanking 
introns. As a result, we found 1,694 candidate sQTLs by a 
cutoff  at  an  FDR  =  0.01.  Fig.  2A  displays  an  exemplary 
boxplot  of  an  sQTL,  located  in  chr3:20,536,243,  which

The RNA-seq raw reads were filtered 
by a quality score, and then, the filtered
reads  were  mapped  to  a  reference 
genome using SHRiMP2. After mapp-
ing,  filtration  with  mapping  quality 
was  carried  out  using  Samtools.  The 
filtered  mapped  reads  and  genotype 
data were analyzed by IVAS in order
to obtain the candidate splicing qua-
ntitative  trait  loci.

The sQTLs and trait-associated SNPs

Here, we interpreted the molecular mechanism of pre-
viously  published  trait-associated  SNPs  into  sQTLs.  The 
published trait-associated SNPs were downloaded from the 
107 phenotypes database [3]. This database includes 107 
phenotypes of 4 categories. We looked for the sQTLs that 
overlapped with SNPs in the database resource and selected 
SNPs having a significant association with phenotypes. As a 
result,  we  found  96  candidate  sQTLs  that  were  able  to 
explain the mechanism of trait-associated SNPs. Among the 
96 candidate sQTLs, we finally selected 25 sQTLs affecting 
high differential expression of an alternatively spliced target 
exon across genotypes. We show an example of a trait-as-
sociated  sQTL  in  Fig.  2.  The  SNP,  which  resides  in 
chr3:20,536,243,  affects  the  ninth  exon  of  AT3G55400, 
OVA1.  That is,  the  expression  ratio of  the  exon with  the 
alternative 3’ splice site is higher in the heterozygote (AG) 
than  in  the  homozygote  (GG).  OVA1  encodes  a  methio-
nine-tRNA ligase and has an association with ovule devel-
opment, and its polymorphism was reported to be associated 
with the pedicel [3]. We report the full list of trait-associated 
sQTLs in Table 1.

Discussion

Here, we report 1,694 genome-wide sQTLs in Arabidopsis 
thaliana with a high-throughput RNA-seq dataset. RNA-seq 
using  next  generation  sequencing  provides  an  accurate 
method for annotation and quantification of exons than the 

exon  array  method,  and  this  is  greatly  helpful  for  the 
investigation of sQTLs [15]. Arabidopsis thaliana is a model 
organism to study the genetic elements of plants [1]. Thus, 
an sQTL survey in Arabidopsis thaliana as a model organism 
has importance for understanding the regulation of alterna-
tive splicing of plants. However, there are only a few studies 
on sQTLs in plant. Thus, our result may be a great resource 
to  explain  the  genetic  regulation  of  alternative  splicing 
patterns. Furthermore, the sQTLs can be useful for explai-
ning known trait-associated SNPs. A recent study showed 
that genetic markers with various traits have been disco-
vered in Arabidopsis [3]. However, their molecular mechanisms 
have remained elusive. sQTLs are able to alter alternative 
splicing patterns, and consequently, they can lead to pheno-
typic  variations  [5-8].  Thus,  our  result  can  be  useful  in 
interpreting trait-associated SNPs as sQTLs. For example, 
the  OVA1  gene  encodes  a  functional  protein  for  methio-
nine-tRNA ligase, having several alpha-helices. The polymo-
rphism, in chr3:20,536,243, was reported to have an asso-
ciation with the flower pedicel [3]. However, this molecular 
mechanism has been not elucidated. Through our result, the 
SNP was shown to have an association with an alternative 3’ 
splicing  site  of  the  ninth  exon  of  the  OVA1  gene.  We 
predicted the three-dimensional structure of proteins trans-
lated by transcription, including normal exons and the alter-
native 3’ splicing site of the ninth exon, respectively, using 
the RaptorX Structure Prediction tool, a web-based protein 
structure prediction tool [16]. As a result, translation of the 
transcript with the alternative 3’ splicing site showed a loss 
of 2 alpha helices (Fig. 2B). It is tempting to speculate that 
the SNP, in chr3:20,536,243, which is known as a trait-as-
sociated  locus,  is  able  to  lead  to  translation  of  abnormal

years. Furthermore, since there have been few investigations

be a reference resource of sQTLs for its neighboring species.
