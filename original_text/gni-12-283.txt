Among all serious diseases globally, diabetes (type 1 and type 2) still poses a major challenge to the world population. Several 
target proteins have been identified, and the etiology causing diabetes has been reasonably well studied. But, there is still a 
gap in deciding on the choice of a drug, especially when the target is mutated. Mutations in the KCNJ11 gene, encoding the 
kir6.2 channel, are reported to be associated with congenital hyperinsulinism, having a major impact in causing type 1 
diabetes, and due to the lack of its 3D structure, an attempt has been made to predict the structure of kir6.2, applying fold 
recognition methods. The current work is intended to investigate the affinity of four phytochemicals namely, curcumin 
(Curcuma longa), genistein (Genista tinctoria), piperine (Piper nigrum), and pterostilbene (Vitis vinifera) in a normal as well 
as in a mutant kir6.2 model by adopting a molecular docking methodology. The phytochemicals were docked in both wild 
and mutated kir6.2 models in two rounds: blind docking followed by ATP-binding pocket-specific docking. From the binding 
pockets, the common interacting amino acid residues participating strongly within the binding pocket were identified and 
compared. From the study, we conclude that these phytochemicals have strong affinity in both the normal and mutant kir6.2 
model. This work would be helpful for further study of the phytochemicals above for the treatment of type 1 diabetes by 
targeting the kir6.2 channel.

Introduction

Type  1  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  is  a  major  health 
problem worldwide. In case of type 1 diabetes, the body is 
unable to produce insulin due to the autoimmune destruc-
tion of the beta-cells in the pancreas [1], and insulin injec-
tion is the only known preventive measure in this case [2]. 
Most  of  the  anti-diabetic  drugs  of  synthetic  origin  have 
serious adverse effects; therefore, phytochemicals and plant 
extracts with anti-diabetic properties have been tested both 
in vivo and in vitro as alternatives for diabetic treatments [3]. 
Phytochemicals,  such  as  curcumin  (Curcuma  longa),  geni-
stein (Genista tinctoria), piperine (Piper nigrum), and ptero-
stilbene (Vitis vinifera), are reported to have potent anti-dia-

betic properties. Curcumin, when tested in diabetic animals, 
exhibited a good sign for the prevention and treatment of 
diabetic encephalopathy [4]. Genistein also plays important 
roles  in  the  regulation  of  glucose  homeostasis  in  type  1 
diabetes  by  down-regulating  G6Pase,  PEPCK,  fatty  acid 
-oxidation,  and  carnitine  palmitoyl  transferase  activities 
while up-regulating malic enzyme and glucose-6-phosphate- 
dehydrogenase activities in the liver, with preservation of 
pancreatic  -cells.  The  supplementation  of  genistein  is 
helpful for preventing insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus 
onset [5] and piperine, an alkaloid, has also been reported to 
possess  potential  anti-  diabetic  effects  [6].  Experimental 
results suggested the antiglycemic effects of pterostilbene in 
an  induced  rat  model  of  hyperglycemia.  Therefore,  the 
antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities of pterostilbene

may confer a protective effect in preventing diabetes [7]. 
Several  receptors  (insulin-  like  growth  factor  receptor,  
glucose  transporter,  and  kir6.2)  and  their  associated 
signaling pathways have been elucidated and are involved in 
glucose regulation and diabetes. But, a significant gap still 
remains as to making the choice of the drug against the target 
receptor in the disease condition. Kir6.2, a major subunit of 
the  ATP-sensitive  K+  channel,  an  inward-rectifying  pota-
ssium  ion  channel,  is  an  integral  membrane  protein  that 
allows K+ to flow from the outside of the cell to the inside, 
which  is  controlled  by  G-proteins  associated  with  sulfo-
nylurea receptor (SUR), to constitute the ATP-sensitive K+ 
channel. During glycolysis, an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio 
blocks KATP channels, causing membrane depolarization, and 
helps in opening the voltage- dependent calcium channel, 
which  facilitates  the  influx  of  calcium,  triggering  the 
exocytosis of insulin. Mutations in the two subunits of SUR1 
and  kir6.2  result  in  the  opening  of  the  pancreatic  KATP 
channel and permanent closing of the calcium channel, thus 
blocking insulin exocytosis. Mutations in KCNJ11, the gene 
encoding  the channel,  are  reported  to be  associated with 
congenital hyperinsulinism [8, 9]. Ten possible mutations 
affecting the regular mechanism of kir6.2 [8, 10, 11] have 
been identified as probable causes of type 1 diabetes. Due to 
the unavailability of the crystal structure of kir6.2 protein, an 
attempt was made here to predict both the secondary and 
tertiary structures using in silico approach. The objective of 
the current investigation is to describe atomic interactions 
and the inhibitory effect between both wild-type and mutant 
models of kir6.2 with phytochemicals, such as curcumin, 
genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene, computationally.

Methods
Structure prediction and model validation of kir6.2 
(wild, mutant)

The primary sequence of kir6.2 (entry name, KCNJ11_ 
HUMAN)  was  retrieved  from  SWISS-PROT/UniProt  KB 
(ID, Q14654). The secondary structure of both wild-type 
and mutant kir6.2 was predicted using Discovery Studio 3.5. 
The  tertiary  structure  prediction  for  kir6.2  models  (both 
wild type and mutant) were performed using the protein fold 
recognition  server  Phyre2  (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/ 
phyre2/) with 100% confidence. The predicted models were 
energetically  minimized  in  ModRefiner  (http://zhanglab. 
ccmb.umich.edu/ModRefiner/) to draw the initial starting 
models  closer  to  their  native  state, in  terms  of  hydrogen 
bonds, backbone topology, and side chain positioning. The 
coordinates of the predicted model of kir6.2 were submitted 
in  Protein  Model  DataBase  (http://bioinformatics.cineca. 
it/PMDB/). Structural validation was done in Procheck and 

Errat2 of the Saves web server (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla. 
edu/SAVES_3/). Protein model quality was checked in the 
protein structure analysis tool ProSA (http://prosa.services. 
came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php). Energetically minimized struc-
tures of both kir6.2 models were visualized and superim-
posed in Discovery Studio 3.5.

Molecular docking of kir6.2 model with 
phytochemicals

Molecular  docking  between  kir6.2  models  and  phyto-
chemicals was accomplished using the AutoDock-4.2 algo-
rithm (http://autodock.scripps.edu/). Kollman united atom 
charges,  solvation  parameters,  and  polar  hydrogens  were 
added into the kir6.2 PDB files for the preparation of the 
protein in the docking simulation. Chemical structures of 
phytochemicals  having  anti-diabetic  properties  were  ex-
tracted from the Pubchem (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pccom-
pound) database of the National Center of Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) web server (Supplementary Fig. 1) in 
SDF format and converted to three-dimensional structures 
in PDB format using Discovery Studio 3.5. Ligand molecules 
were  prepared  by  choosing  the  root  and  restricting  the 
number  of  torsion  within  a  minimum  range.  AutoDock 
requires precalculated grid maps, one for each atom type 
present in the flexible molecules being docked, and it stores 
the potential energy arising from the interaction with rigid 
macromolecules. One hundred runs of blind dockings were 
performed  for  all  inhibitors  with  both  the  wild-type  and 
mutant protein model of kir6.2. Then next round of docking 
was performed by setting a grid of 98, 100, and 62 points in 
the x, y, and z directions, respectively, in the ATP-binding site 
of kir6.2 [12] for both models by applying the Lamarckian 
genetic algorithm. The best poses of docking during both 
rounds were compared and reported with the binding energy 
reported for each case. The visualization and analysis were 
performed using Discover Studio 3.5 package.

Results
Structure prediction and validation of kir6.2 
structural models

The primary sequence of kir6.2 (UniProt ID, Q14654) is a 
transmembrane protein with 390 amino acid residues. Ten 
mutations [10] were introduced in the primary sequence of 
kir6.2 for mutant model prediction purposes. Two tertiary 
structural models were predicted for both wild (template 
PDB ID, 3JYC) and mutant-type kir6.2 (template PDB ID, 
3SYA) separately using Phyre2 [13] with 100% confidence, 
followed  by  energy  minimization  using  ModRefiner  [14] 
web  server.  The  structural  model  of  kir6.2  is  publically 
available  in  the  Protein  Model  DataBase  (PMID  ID, 

284

www.genominfo.org

PM0079770). The quality of the model was compared with 
three existing models of kir6.2 available in the Protein Model 
Portal  (http://www.proteinmodelportal.org/query/uniprot/ 
Q14654).  The  first  model  available  in  the  Protein  Model 
Portal was done for the amino acid region of 179–351, taking 
template PDB ID 1U4F, chain C with a 53% identity score. 
However, this model is not complete in comparison to the 
present  predicted  model  of  kir6.2  (PMID,  PM0079770), 
which  is  modeled  from  amino  acid  region  33–358.  The 
second and third models available are almost complete and 
modeled for the same amino acid region as in the present 
model of wild kir6.2. While comparing the quality with all 
experimentally  determined  protein  chains  in  the  current 
PDB  using  the  ProSA  web  server  [15]  by  means  of  a 
significant  statistical  score  (z-score)  in  terms  of  folding 
energy, the second and third models had a z-score computed 
in the ProSA web server of –5.16 (Supplementary Fig. 2B) 
and –5.6  (Supplementary  Fig.  2C),  respectively,  while  in 
comparison, the current model had a good folding energy 
score−i.e., z-score of –5.96 (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The 
overall  quality  factors  of  these  two  models  were  also 
compared with the current predicted model of kir6.2 using 
Errat2. The overall quality factor for the second and third 
models deposited in the Protein Model Portal was computed 
to be 69.132 (Supplementary Fig. 3B) and 67.508 (Supple-
mentary  Fig.  3C),  respectively,  which  is  quite  poor  in 
comparison to the quality score of 78.778 (Supplementary 
Fig.  3A)  computed  for  the  current  model  of  kir6.2 
(PM0079770). Again, superimposition of the second model 
(blue color) available in Protein Model Portal and the present 
model of kir6.2 (red color) also gives a clear-cut idea of the 
quality of the model presented here (Supplementary Fig. 4). 
The quality of the backbone folding pattern of the present 
model (Supplementary Fig. 5A) in comparison to the third 
model available in Protein Model Portal (Supplementary Fig. 
5B) is also good. From the above, it is found that the model

predicted here for kir6.2 is good in comparison to all three 
existing models available in Protein Model Portal.

Structural comparison of wild and mutant models 
of kir6.2

Similarly, by comparison of the wild and mutant models of 
kir6.2, the quality is confirmed as good for both predicted 
models of kir6.2, because the values of the computed z-score 
of the computed models of kir6.2 are within the range of 
z-scores of the groups of structures from different sources, 
like X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance (Supplementary 
Fig. 6). The Ramachandran plot statistics (Supplementary 
Fig. 7) show 93.8% of residues in the most favored region in 
the case of the wild kir6.2 model, whereas in the mutant 
model, 92.8% of residues are found in the same region. At 
the same time, no residues were found in the disallowed 
region in both the wild and mutant models of kir6.2, which 
signified the good quality of the backbone folding pattern in 
both  models.  The  non-bonded 
interactions  between 
different  atoms  were  plotted  residue-wise  against  error 
function to calculate the overall quality factor of both models 
in  Errat2,  which  justified  the  improvement  in  quality  of 
kir6.2  mutant  model  (Supplementary  Fig.  8).  The  com-
parison of secondary structural elements of both wild-type 
and  mutant  kir6.2  (Supplementary  Table  1)  reveals  that 
there is an increment in disordered regions in the mutant 
model, but there is no major structural deviation due to the 
mutation introduced at the sequence level (Fig. 1). This is 
also supported by the root mean square deviation of the main 
chain at the tertiary structural level, which is computed as 
0.854 by superimposition of the structural models of both 
wild and mutant kir6.2 (Fig. 2).

kir6.2 model and all four phytochemicals (Supplementary 
Fig. 1) separately for 100 runs (blind docking) and 10 runs 
(ATP-binding  site  docking)  revealed  that  phytochemicals 
bind favorably in the same pocket of the wild kir6.2 model. 
The same observation was found in the case of the docking 
of the mutant kir6.2 model with the same phytochemicals 
(Supplementary Fig. 1), which supports the prediction of the 
pocket as an active binding region for phytochemicals. The 
best docked poses found in energetically favorable binding 
conditions with phytochemicals are reported (Supplemen-
tary Table 2). The comparative data of interacting residues 
within 4 Å in both the wild and mutant kir6.2 predicted 
models are reported in Table 1. The hydrophobic amino acids 
Ala-178, Leu-181, Phe-183, and Ala-300 are found within 
the  pocket,  providing  stability  towards  the  binding  of 
phytochemicals  with  the  kir6.2  models.  The  interacting 
residues of the mutant kir6.2 model are deciphered in Fig. 3, 
along  with  hydrogen  bond  interactions  within  3.5  Å  of 
distance (Table 2). As per the information in Table 2, the 
amino acids Phe-183 and Arg-301 have common involve-
ment in hydrogen bonding in the mutant model of the kir6.2 

protein  with  curcumin,  genistein,  piperine,  and  ptero-
stilbene, suggesting strong binding affinity in the predicted 
binding pocket.

Discussion

It is a well-established fact that the main cause of type 1 
diabetes  is  the  autoimmune  destruction  of  -cells  in  the 
pancreas [1]. Reports demonstrate that kir6.2 is an ATP/ 
ADP  ratio-sensitive  protein  that  plays  a  vital  role  in 
operating the K+ channel and simultaneously controls Ca+2 
ion channel function, which in turn triggers the exocytosis of 
insulin. But, due to mutations [10] in certain amino acids 
(H46Y, R50Q, Q52R, G53D, V59M, L164P, C166T, K170T, 
R201H,  and  Y330S),  the  whole  mechanism  is  perturbed, 
blocking the exocytosis of insulin, which might be a cause of 
type-1 diabetes. Again, due to the unavailability of the crystal 
structure  of  kir6.2,  molecular  targeting  with  drugs  is 
difficult.  But,  a  rational  design  of  in  silico  structure  pre-
diction  approaches  comes  in  handy  under  such  circum-
stances to study this further. From the structural inspection

of both wild-type and mutant kir6.2 models, it is concluded 
that mutation has no major structural changes or deviation 
in the structure quality of the model. In recent years, due to 
the adverse effect of synthetic drugs, phytochemicals have 
drawn substantial attention as alternative medications. The 
literature reports curcumin, genistein, piperine, and ptero-
stilbene  to  have  strong  inhibitory  effects  against  type  1 
diabetes.  Hence,  all  four  of  these  phytochemicals  were 
docked with predicted models of kir6.2 in the ATP-binding 
pocket [12] to check the inhibitory effect after mutation. The 
results of docking suggested that all phytochemicals bind at 
high affinity with both models, and the common interacting 
residues  Ala-178,  Leu-181,  Phe-183,  and  Ala-300  were 
found in the same pocket, even after mutation. Amino acid 
residues, like Phe-183 and Arg-301, have also been observed 
as  participating  in  hydrogen  bonding  within  the  binding 
pocket of mutant kir6.2 in the case of docking with all four 
inhibitors, supporting the fact that mutation might not affect 
the binding affinity of kir6.2 protein with phytochemicals. 
The current investigation concluded that  phytochemicals, 
like curcumin, genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene, have 
strong inhibitory effects on kir6.2 protein. In addition, the 
study  reports  that  these  four  phytochemicals  namely, 
curcumin, genistein, piperine, and pterostilbene are effective
