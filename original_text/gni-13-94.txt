tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). A growing number of reports have 
shown that tRFs are not random degradation products but are functional ncRNAs made of specific tRNA cleavage. They play 
regulatory roles in several biological contexts such as cancer, innate immunity, stress responses, and neurological disorders. 
In this review, we summarize the biogenesis and functions of tRFs.

Introduction

It is now well known that mammalian genomes encode, in 
addition to protein-coding genes, RNA molecules that have 
no  protein-coding  capacity,  and  thus  are  referred  to  as 
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [1] . Recent high throughput 
sequencing data suggest that there are about four times as 
many ncRNA transcripts as there are protein-coding RNA 
transcripts in human cells. While some ncRNAs, such as 
ribosomal  RNAs  (rRNAs),  transfer  RNAs  (tRNAs),  and 
those  well-studied  ones  including  microRNAs  (miRNAs) 
and  small  interfering  RNAs  (siRNAs),  are  recognized  as 
functional  molecules,  the  majority  of  ncRNAs  and  their 
biological  roles  in  mammals  are  underappreciated,  as 
evolution would have favored against such gratuitous and 
wasteful transcription [2]. However, accumulating evidence 
has exhibited a remarkable degree of their involvement in 
many biological events including cell proliferation, cellular 
stress  responses,  host  immune  responses  and  virus 
replication [3-6]. Based on their size, ncRNAs are classified 

into long, medium, and small ones. Those longer than 200 
nucleotides  (nt)  are  termed  as  long  (or  large)  ncRNAs 
(lncRNAs)  and  include  the  majority  of  nuclear  ncRNAs. 
Those  ranging  40−200  nt  are  medium-sized  ncRNAs 
including many classic ncRNAs such as 5S rRNA, tRNAs, 
small  nuclear  RNAs  (snRNAs),  small  nucleolar  RNAs 
(snoRNAs),  etc.  ncRNAs  shorter  than  40  nt  are  termed 
small  ncRNAs  (sncRNAs)  that  have  been  extensively 
studied in the last two decades and will be elaborated in the 
next  section.  In  this  review,  we  will  focus  on  a  recently 
discovered  class  of  sncRNAs  called  tRNA-derived  RNA 
fragments  (tRFs),  as  data  from  several  groups  including 
those from us suggested them to be emerging functional 
molecules. 

The functionality of ncRNAs was initially bolstered by the 
discovery showing that sncRNAs are capable of mediating 
both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing 
[7]. The most extensively studied among them are miRNAs 
that  regulate  target  mRNAs  post-transcriptionally  in 
animals  and  plants  [8-10].  Another  class  of  sncRNAs  is 
siRNAs that are closely related to miRNAs [11]. Although

naturally occurring siRNAs have been reported to be present 
in some mammals in addition to plants and flies [12, 13], 
siRNAs  are  more  renowned  as  an  experimental  tool  in 
mammalian cells. The gene silencing by synthetic double- 
stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) and their Dicer-cleavage products 
(that are siRNAs) is called RNA interference (RNAi) and has 
been being used as a popular gene knockdown method [3]. 
This  technical  breakthrough  was  well  recognized  and 
celebrated by the 2006 Nobel Prize, which was awarded to 
the two scientists who discovered RNAi [14, 15]. A number 
of  other  sncRNAs  have  also  been  identified  in  various 
organisms [16, 17], including piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), 
repeat-associated siRNA (rasiRNA), tiny ncRNAs (tncRNA), 
heterochromatic small RNA (21U-RNA, hcRNA), scan RNA 
(scnRNA), transcription initiation RNA (tiRNA) [18], and 
promoter/termini-associated  sRNA  (PASR/TASR)  [19]. 
Although some of these have been shown to play roles in 
several  biological  processes  such  as  heterochromatin 
formation  and  transposon  silencing,  their  functions  are 
largely unknown and detailed description of them is beyond 
the scope of this review [10]. 

Mature tRNAs are characterized by their evolutionarily 
conserved  secondary  and  tertiary  structures,  extensive 
post-transcriptional  modifications  (up  to  100  nucleoside 
modifications have been described), extreme stability and 
resistance to nucleases [20-22]. There are more than 600 
tRNA genes in humans, which are far more than needed for 
at  most  64  anticodons  and  20  amino  acids  [23-25], 
suggesting gene-specific functions of tRNAs other than its 
traditional function in linking a codon to the cognate amino 
acid during translation. Indeed, tRFs were recently identified 
as a new class of sncRNAs fragmentized from tRNAs and 
shown  to  be  important  in  regulating  cell  proliferation, 
stress-induced  translational  suppression,  stress  granule 
(SG) assembly, and virus replication. Expression of some 
tRFs is commonly seen among different organisms, further 
supporting that tRFs have emerged as important players in 
diverse aspects of biology. 

Biogenesis and Structure of tRFs
A mature tRNA has a 5ˊ-monophosphate group and 3ˊ- 
CCA charged with cognate amino acid. All properly folded 
tRNAs,  with  so  called  a  cloverleaf  structure,  have  four 
base-paired stems (in 5ˊ–3ˊ direction: D arm, anticodon arm, 
T arm, and acceptor stem) bridging the conserved D-loop, 
tRNA-specific  anticodon  loop,  variable  loop,  and  T-loop. 
Primary transcripts (pre-tRNAs) undergo several stages of 
maturation before becoming translation-competent tRNAs 
[26]. Compared to a mature tRNA, a pre-tRNA lacks a CCA 
tail but includes a 5ˊ-leader starting with triphosphate, a 3ˊ-

trailer  with  an  oligouridine  stretch  and,  for  intron-con-
taining tRNA, a variably-sized intron. The 5ˊ- and 3ˊ-end of a 
pre-tRNA are trimmed by the endonucleases RNase P and 
RNase  Z  respectively,  and  an  intron  is  spliced  if  there  is 
[27,28]. The ‘CCA’ acceptor stem must be added to the 3ˊ- 
end as this is not encoded in eukaryotes [29]. While mature, 
uncleaved  tRNAs  have  a  well-defined  role  in  protein 
translation,  multiple  groups  have  cloned  and  sequenced 
shorter  tRNA  fragments  [30].  These  fragments  (termed 
“tRFs”) identified so far can be classified into three groups; 
tRF-5 series whose 5ˊ-end is aligned to the 5ˊ-end of mature 
tRNA, tRF-3 series whose 3ˊ-end is aligned to the 3ˊ-end of 
mature  tRNA,  and  tRF-1  series  which  is  the  3ˊ-trailer 
sequence  in  a  pre-tRNA  and  released  during  3ˊ-end 
processing (Fig. 1). Some groups have also termed the tRF-5 
or tRF-3 series as tRF halves or type I [31, 32] and tRF1 
series as type II [32]. 

The tRF-5 series were the first identified class of tRFs and 
were usually formed by a cleavage in the D or anticodon loop 
of a mature tRNA. They have been reported in mammalian 
cells,  plants,  and  fission  yeast  [3,  33-36].  As  aforemen-
tioned, the tRF-3 series are those derived from the 3ˊ-end of 
a mature tRNA, usually by cleavage in the T loop [3, 32, 
37-39].  As  the  3ˊ-end  of  mature  tRNAs  is  the  acceptor 
trinucleotide CCA, the tRF-3 series also characteristically 
has  an  end  CCA.  The  tRF-1  series  are  undoubtedly  the 
RNase Z cleavage product of a pre-tRNA, because their 5ˊ- 
ends begin immediately after the 3ˊ-terminus of the mature 
tRNA and their 3ˊ-ends are a series of U residues that are 
residual from RNA polymerase III transcription run-off [3, 
32,  40,  41].  Overall,  the  cleavage  of  tRFs  is  very  much 
structure-dependent,  suggesting  they  are  not  randomly 
degraded products.

Other  reasons  supporting  that  tRFs  are  biologically 
meaningful include their endonuclease-specific cleavage [3, 
4,  34,  42].  The  production  of  the  tRF-5  series  has  been 
reported  to  be  Dicer  or  angiogenin  (ANG)-dependent  in 
mammals  [33,  34].  In  one  case,  the  tRF-5  series  were 
identified to be produced after the hybridization of the 3ˊ-end 
of the human cellular tRNAlys with the HIV-1 primer binding 
site, raising the possibility that, at least in certain cases, tRFs 
may be produced when a tRNA base-pairs with another RNA 
molecule [38]. It has been reported that the tRF-3 series are 
generated by Dicer [32, 38]. In Tetrahymena, although the 
nuclease identity was not proven, the tRF-3 series have 5ˊ- 
monophosphates that are usually left after Dicer cleavage 
and  are  in  physical  association  with  Argonaute/Piwi 
proteins,  suggesting  Dicer-mediated  cleavage  [39].  The 
tRNA 3ˊ-trailer sequences are thought to be rapidly degraded 
in the nuclear compartment soon after being cleaved from 
pre-tRNAs. Therefore, it is quite surprising that the tRF-1

series are localized mainly in the cytoplasm [3, 41]. There are 
two explanations on how the tRF-1 series bypass nuclear 
cleavage: (1) the tRF-1 series are exported from the nucleus 
by  an  unknown  mechanism  upon  processing,  or  (2) 
pre-tRNAs escape nuclear quality control and are processed 
by  cytoplasmic  RNase  Z.  Biological  evidence  indeed 
supports  the  second  possibility.  At  least  in  one  case  of  a 
tRF-1 molecule derived from tRNASer (termed tRF-1001 [3] 
and Cand45 [32]), the corresponding pre- tRNA is localized 
in  the  cytoplasm  [3,  32].  Also  there  are  several  reports 
supporting  the  cytoplasmic  localization  of  tRNA  endonu-
cleases responsible for the tRF-1 series [3, 43]. 

Biological Function of tRFs

Are  tRFs  merely  by-products  of  tRNA  degradation  or 
nuclease  off-target  effects?  Or  do  they  have  bona  fide 
biological functions? If they do have functions, how diverse 
are these functions? Several lines of evidence have identified 
their regulatory targets, supporting that they are functional 
molecules [31, 34, 35, 37]. Although the exact roles of tRFs 
are further to be elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests 
that  they  participate  in  two  main  types  of  biological 
processes as discussed in more detail below (Fig. 2).

Translation regulation 

tRNAs are indispensable components of the translational 
machinery,  hence  one  can  surmise  that  tRNA  cleavage 
affects protein synthesis. However, the mode of translational 
regulation by tRNA cleavage is not simply a result of change 
in  the  mature  tRNA  pool  available  for  protein  synthesis. 
Ivanov et al. showed that tRNA halves generated by ANG 
during  stress  play  an  active  role  in  inhibiting  protein 
synthesis and triggering the phospho-eIF2α-independent 
assembly of SGs [44].

In addition to tRNA halves, tRFs have also been reported 
to be involved in global translational inhibition in human 
cells. In the archaeon Haloferax volcanii a 26-nt long tRF-5 
originating from tRNAVal in a stress-dependent manner was 
shown to directly bind to the small ribosomal subunit and 
reduce  protein  synthesis  by  interfering  with  peptidyl 
transferase activity [45]. A similar mechanism of translation 
inhibition by a tRF-5 was also observed in human cells [46]. 
A  19-nt  long  tRF-5  derived  from  tRNAGln  decreased  the 
expression of a reporter gene that did not have a sequence 
complementary to that of the tRF-5, suggesting that non- 
specific translational repression is mediated by this tRF-5. 
An interesting observation from this study was that the tRFs 

96

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

required a conserved “GG” dinucleotide for their activity in 
inhibiting  translation.  Because  the  tRF-5  series  were 
detected in the polysome fraction, interaction of the tRF-5 
with the ribosome may contribute to translation [46].

Gene silencing

In addition to above-mentioned translational regulation, 
it  has  become  apparent  that  some  tRFs  mediate  gene 
silencing  similarly  to  miRNAs  by  binding  to  Argonaute 
family proteins [16, 17, 47]. The first tRFs suggested to be 
involved  in  the  gene  silencing  are  some  tRF-5  and  -3 
molecules [32]. Haussecker et al. observed that they are in 
association with Ago-3 and -4 and exhibit trans-gene silen-
cing activity. However, this activity is much lower than that 
of miRNAs. On the other hand, some groups showed that 
the tRF-5 series have inefficient association with Argonautes 
[34] and do not exhibit detectable silencing effects [31].

Probably  the  most  convincing  result  is  from  our  recent 
studies on a tRF-5 molecule derived from mature tRNAGluCTC 
(tRF5-GluCTC). Upon infection of respiratory syncytial virus 
(RSV),  tRF5-GluCTC  is  induced  robustly  and  plays  a 
gene-silencing  role  on  a  target  mRNA  with  a  reverse 
complementary  target  sequence.  In  this  case,  the  trans- 
silencing mechanism used by this tRF was distinct from that 
of canonical miRNA/siRNA. Mutagenesis studies demon-
strated that the 3ˊ-portion of tRF5-GluCTC is critical for its 
gene silencing function, in contrast to miRNAs whose 5ˊ
-portion is the key determinant in target recognition [5].

RNA  fragments  (tRFs).

Roles of tRFs in Human Disease

The  expression  of  tRFs  is  altered  in  a  number  of 
pathological conditions and so those tRFs could be useful 
disease  biomarkers.  The  involvement  of  tRFs  in  cancer, 
neurodegeneration and infectious disease will be discussed 
in the following paragraphs (Fig. 2) [5, 48].

tRFs in cancer

The role of tRFs in cancer was first reported by Lee et al3. 
One of the tRF-1 series (namely tRF-1001), derived from 
pre-tRNASer, is highly expressed in several cancer cell lines 
relative to non-proliferating normal tissues, and is required 
for proliferation of prostate cancer cells [3]. The levels of 
tRF-1001 in cancer cells are directly related to the degree of 
cellular  proliferation.  Knocking  down  this  tRF  causes  a 
dramatic loss of cell viability and inhibition of cell prolife-
ration with specific accumulation of cells in G2 phase and 
inhibition of DNA synthesis [3]. In addition, analysis of the 
small  RNA  transcriptome  in  prostate  cancer  revealed 
enrichment of tRFs in both non-metastatic and metastatic 
lymph  node  prostate  cancer  samples  [3].  The  molecular 
mechanism by which tRF-1001 affects cell physiology is not 
known. There may be a differential processing of tRNA in 
prostate  cancer  because  tRFs  in  non-metastatic  samples 
were 18 nucleotides long whereas tRFs in metastatic tissues 
were 27 nucleotides long [49].

The important role of tRFs in controlling cancer is also 
supported  by  the  observation  showing  enhanced  ANG 
expression in almost all types of cancer [50-52]. Recently, it 
has been shown that ANG produced tRFs that re-program

translation and promote the assembly of stress granules. As 
these events help cells survive under adverse conditions, it is 
possible  that  ANG-induced  tRFs  may  contribute  to 
ANG-mediated cancer cell proliferation [48]. tRFs have also 
been reported to help cancer cells to prevent apoptosome 
formation by binding to cytochrome c [53].

fashion  [56].  While  the  exact  mechanistic  details  on  the 
interplay  between  CLP1  activity,  tRNA  splicing  and 
functions of pre-tRNA-derived tRFs are yet to be uncovered, 
these  studies  provide  a  basis  for  further  investigations 
linking  aberrant  tRNA  metabolism  and  development  of 
neurodegeneration [48].

tRFs and neurodegenerative diseases

tRFs and viral infectious disease

Although tRNA metabolism is essential for all human cells, 
a number of neurological disorders are caused by defects in 
tRNA  metabolism  and  tRNA  processing  enzymes.  ANG 
mutants possessing reduced RNase activity were implicated 
in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a 
fatal  neurodegenerative  disease  [54].  A  subset  of  ALS- 
associated  ANG  mutants  was  also  found  in  Parkinson’s 
disease patients [55]. Administration of recombinant ANG 
to  cultured  neurons  protects  them  from  stress-induced 
apoptosis and promotes the lifespan and motor function of 
SOD1 (G93A) mice, a laboratory ALS model. 

In neurons, excessive accumulation of some tRF-5 series 
members that are derived from a specific subset of tRNAs 
(Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Val, and Lys) triggers a sustained stress 
response leading to neuronal loss and links aberrant tRNA 
metabolism  to  the  development  of  certain  forms  of 
intellectual disability [48].

tRFs  derived  from  intron-containing  tRNAs  are  also 
strongly implicated in neurodegeneration [56-58]. A study 
on mutant mice carrying a catalytically inactive form of the 
RNA  kinase  CLP1,  a  component  of  the  tRNA  splicing 
endonuclease  complex,  revealed  a  neurological  disorder 
characterized  by  progressive  loss  of  lower  spinal  motor 
neurons. Surprisingly, mutant mice accumulate a novel class 
of  tRFs.  In  addition,  homozygous  missense  mutations  in 
CLP1 (R140H) were found in patients with pontocerebellar 
hypoplasia,  a  heterogeneous  group  of  inherited  neurode-
generative disorders characterized by impaired development 
of various parts of the brain. These patients were identified 
to suffer from severe motor-sensory defects, cortical dysge-
nesis  and  microcephaly,  and  exhibit  alterations  in  tRNA 
splicing  [59].  On  the  cellular  level,  the  R140A  mutation 
leads to the depletion of mature tRNAs, the accumulation of 
unspliced  pre-tRNAs  in  patient-derived  induced  neurons 
[58]  and  the  accumulation  of  linear  tRNA  introns  [57]. 
Transfection of 5ˊ-unphosphorylated tRF corresponding to 
the 3ˊ-exon of pre-tRNATyr (the natural substrate of CLP1) 
into patient cells results in reduced neuron survival under 
oxidative stress compared to the transfection of the 5ˊ-exon, 
which had no effect on viability [58]. The kinase-dead CLP1 
mice accumulate 5ˊ-leader-exon-tRFs that sensitize cells to 
oxidative stress and promote cell death in a p53-dependent 

Viruses  exploit  a  number  of  strategies  to  evade  host 
immune recognition and to facilitate viral replication. Some 
of  these  strategies  involve  viral-derived  or  endogenous 
cellular ncRNAs that interact with host immune responses 
[60]. 

We have demonstrated that RSV, the most common cause 
of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies, employs a novel 
mechanism to suppress antiviral responses via induction of 
some tRFs [5, 61]. We have shown that RSV infection in 
airway epithelial cells leads to the activation of endonuclease 
ANG, subsequently inducing abundant production of tRFs, 
most of which belong to that tRF-5 series. The cleavage sites 
by  ANG  are  preferentially  adjacent  to  the  5ˊ-end  of  the 
anticodon-loop, generating tRF-5 series. These tRF-5s are 
localized exclusively in the cellular cytoplasm [5]. At least 
one of the tRFs, namely tRF5-GluCTC (tRF-5 derived from 
tRNAGlu), has a trans-gene silencing function. Significantly, 
an  antiviral  target  suppressed  by  tRF5-GluCTC  downre-
gulates RSV replication and significantly decreases the yield 
of  infectious  viral  particles  produced  by  infected  cells, 
demonstrating a stimulatory role for tRF5-GluCTC in RSV 
replication [5]. 

Using an elegant biochemical approach, named HITS-ABt 
(hIgh-throughput  sequencing  of  RNAs  associated  with 
biotinylated  tRF),  to  capture  tRF5-GluCTC-containing 
ribonucleoprotein complexes combined with bioinformatics 
analysis, we have identified a number of potential cellular 
mRNA  targets  of  tRF5-GluCTC.  One  of  the  candidate 
mRNAs was shown to be a direct target of tRF5-GluCTC. 
Mechanistically, tRF5-GluCTC recognizes a target site in the 
3ˊ-untranslated region of APOER2 mRNA and suppresses its 
expression  by  an  unknown  mechanism.  Further  analysis 
identified  a  previously  unappreciated  role  for  APOER2 
protein in antiviral defense against RSV infection [61]. Thus, 
we  have  illuminated  the  roles  of  tRFs  in  host–virus 
interactions and described a novel molecular mechanism for 
host  response  regulation  via  gene  targeting  at  posttran-
scriptional level, proving a potential therapeutic target to 
control  RSV  replication  by  regulating  tRFs  induction.  As 
another  example  of  tRFs  with  a  positive  effect  on  viral 
replication, a tRF-3 derived from tRNAPro (tRF-3019) has 
been suggested to function as a primer for reverse transcrip-

tion of human T-cell leukemia virus-1 [62].

The  induction  of  tRFs  is  virus  specific,  as  human 
metapneumovirus,  a  negative-sense  single  stranded  RNA 
virus  belonging  to  the  Paramyxoviridae  family  [63]  and 
frequent cause for lower respiratory tract infections in young 
children,  immunocompromised  patients  and  older  adults 
[64-67],  did not induce  tRFs  but gradually  enhanced  the 
expression  percentage  of  miRNAs  in  a  time-dependent 
fashion [6]. The involvement of tRFs in infectious diseases 
suggests that tRFs may be targets for the development of 
new drugs to control viral replication. 

Conclusion

The human genome encodes hundreds of tRNA genes and 
pseudogenes. In the past two decades, an increasing number 
of reports have revealed abundant expression of functional 
tRFs; thus, it now appears highly plausible that cells use 
tRNAs  as  a  source  for  functional  sncRNAs  to  modulate 
biological  processes  beyond  its  translation  function.  It  is 
imperative to discriminate functional tRNA fragments from 
“meaningless” degradation products, and to biochemically 
elucidate  the  factors  in  their  biogenesis  as  well  as  to 
determine their molecular functions. Although tRFs, at least 
the  tRF-5s  induced  by  RSV,  regulate  gene  expression  at 
post-transcriptional  stages  in  the  cytoplasm,  the  precise 
mechanism is yet to be clarified. Like miRNAs, tRFs can 
repress  target  mRNAs  by  inhibiting  their  translation  or 
facilitating their decay. These questions can be answered by 
analyzing  their  localization,  identifying  their  interacting 
protein partners besides Argonaute proteins, and examining 
various biological phenomena in response to the changes in 
the  expression  of  tRFs.  Bioinformatics  studies  with  the 
support from biochemical assays have identified numerous 
novel  tRNA-interacting  proteins  [68],  implying  that  the 
biological functions of tRNAs and their fragments may be 
way  beyond  our  expectations.  Further  combination  of 
computational  and  biochemical  efforts  will  significantly 
advance our understanding of functional tRFs and expand 
our knowledge regarding the tRNA world. 

The availability of genome sequencing data from patients 
with diverse conditions has already led to the identification 
of several mutations in tRNA genes and in genes involved in 
tRNA biogenesis [69]. The task now is to ascertain whether 
these  mutations  indeed  affect  the  repertoire  of  tRFs  and 
consequently  the  molecular  pathology  of  the  diseases. 
Studies  on  tRFs  are  still  at  a  very  early  stage.  Additional 
functions for tRFs are likely to be discovered continuously. 
Improved understanding of the functions of tRFs will provide 
valuable insights into human physiology and pathophysiology.
Recognition of tRFs as an important class of functional

molecules  has  not  happened  until  recently.  The  apparent 
presence  of  abundant  tRFs  in  early  studies  with  next 
generation sequencing data was often ignored. However, the 
combined biochemical evidence from many years of tRNA 
biology studies has brought the field to a previously unex-
pected conceptual consensus: specific tRFs are not simply 
random  degradation  products  but  functional  molecules 
based on the following observations: (1) in many cases, tRFs 
do  not  derive  from  abundant  cellular  tRNAs,  and  the 
numbers of tRFs do not correlate with the parental tRNA 
gene  copy  numbers;  (2)  their  fragmentation  patterns  are 
tRNA structure-dependent; (3) the fragmentation patterns 
is determined by the developmental stage or cell conditions; 
and  (4)  it  is  reported  that  some  tRFs  are  bound  to 
Argonaute/Piwi  proteins,  well-known  components  of  the 
RNA-induced  silencing  complex  [21,  31,  70-73].  The 
expression  of  tRFs  does  not  usually  affect  mature  tRNA 
pools. Instead, it is involved in normal biological processes 
beyond  translation  and  in  diseases;  thus,  studies  of  tRFs 
have provided new insights into tRNA biology.
