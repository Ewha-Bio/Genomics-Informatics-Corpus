Although  a  large  number  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  have  been  identified  from  the  bovine  genome- 
sequencing project, few of these have been validated at large in Bos indicus breeds. We have genotyped 192 animals, 
representing 5 cattle populations of Ethiopia, with the Illumina Bovine 8K SNP BeadChip. These include 1 Sanga (Danakil), 3 
zebu (Borana, Arsi and Ambo), and 1 zebu × Sanga intermediate (Horro) breeds. The Hanwoo (Bos taurus) was included for 
comparison purposes. Analysis of 7,045 SNP markers revealed that the mean minor allele frequency (MAF) was 0.23, 0.22, 
0.21, 0.21, 0.23, and 0.29 for Ambo, Arsi, Borana, Danakil, Horro, and Hanwoo, respectively. Significant differences of MAF 

were observed between the indigenous Ethiopian cattle populations and Hanwoo breed (p ＜ 0.001). Across the Ethiopian 
cattle populations, a common variant MAF (≥0.10 and ≤0.5) accounted for an overall estimated 73.79% of the 7,045 SNPs. 
The Hanwoo displayed a higher proportion of common variant SNPs (90%). Investigation within Ethiopian cattle populations 
showed that on average, 16.64% of the markers were monomorphic, but in the Hanwoo breed, only 6% of the markers were 
monomorphic. Across the sampled Ethiopian cattle populations, the mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 
0.314 and 0.313, respectively. The level of SNP variation identified in this particular study highlights that these markers can 
be potentially used for genetic studies in African cattle breeds.

Introduction

Ethioipian  cattle  breeds  are  the  core  to  sustain  the 
livelihoods  of  most  of  the  farming  and  pastoral  commu-
nities. Indigenous breeds are known for their better adap-
tation  for  low  input  systems,  heat  tolerance,  disease 
resistance,  local  preferences,  and  cultural  and  aesthetic 
values. The unique genetic background of Ethiopian cattle 
and their adaptation to the low input system support their 
conservation and breed development. However, common for 
developing countries, the genetic diversity and the genetic 
merits of most Ethiopian indigenous cattle populations are 
not yet well understood and exploited. Consequently, some 
of the indigenous cattle populations are already extinct and 

endangered,  while  the  risk  status  of  many  of  them  is 
unknown. A recent microsatellite based study revealed that 
most  Ethiopian  cattle  breeds  are  under  threat  from  un-
controlled  breeding  practices  and  are  at  high  risk  of 
becoming genetically homogenous [1].

Studies  on  genetic  diversity  of  Ethiopian  cattle  have 
focused on  limited  cattle  breeds, and all  of these studies 
employed  low-density  microsatellite,  mitochondrial,  or 
Y-chromosome markers [1, 2]. A wide range of molecular 
markers  has  been  developed  and  used  for  molecular 
characterization of populations. Among these, single nucle-
otides  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  are  the  most  abundant 
molecular markers in the genome. They are widely dispersed 
throughout  genomes,  with  a  variable  distribution  among

species; genotyping results are easy to reproduce in different 
laboratories and are simple to score. The usefulness of SNPs 
in  population  diversity  and  structure  studies  has  been 
demonstrated in several studies in livestock species [3-6]. 
Although a large number of SNPs have been identified 
from the bovine genome-sequencing project, few of these 
have been validated at large in Bos indicus breeds. Yet, the 
level of polymorphism in Ethiopian cattle population has not 
been known and analyzed. Prior to this study, no SNPs have 
been described for these populations. Hence, we report the 
first  preliminary  findings  on  SNP  variation  in  Ethiopian 
indigenous cattle populations and Hanwoo breed. This study 
is  part  of  the  collaborative  project  between  the  Korean 
Government,  the  Ethiopian  Institute  of  Agricultural  Re-
search, and the International Livestock Research Institute, 
designed with the objectives to estimate genetic diversity 
between and within populations using SNP markers. We also 
evaluated  the  level  of  SNP  polymorphisms  in  selected 
Ethiopian cattle populations and compared to the Hanwoo 
cattle breed. 

Methods
Sampling and DNA sample collection 

Nasal  samples  were  collected  using  Performagene 
LIVESTOCK's nasal swab DNA collection kit (DNA Genotek 
Inc., Kanata, ON, Canada) from 5 cattle populations-Ambo, 
Borana,  Arsi,  Horro,  and  Danakil-inhabiting  different 
agro-ecologies.  Sampling  was  carried  out  by  considering 
potential  geo-environmental  gradients  (highland,  low-
lands), production systems (mixed-crop livestock, pastoral/ 
agro-pastoral), and ethnic groups raising predominantly the 
populations  (Table  1,  Fig.  1).  Representative  sites  were 
selected based upon secondary data obtained from livestock 
departments  and expertise. Herdsmen and  owners  of  the 
animals were contacted to ensure that the animals were not 
genetically related. Animals were randomly sampled from 
multiple  herds.  Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  nasal 

samples based on laboratory protocols. In addition, DNA 
samples from Hanwoo cattle were included for comparison 
purposes.

Breeds/populations descriptions

The  Danakil  cattle  breed  is  grouped  under  Sanga  and 
originated in East and Northeast Africa, where Sanga cattle 
evolved.  The  Horro  breed  was  formed  as  a  result  of 
interbreeding between zebu-Sanga and Sanga-zebu admix-
ture populations. The large-sized Borana breed descended 
from secondary cattle domestication in the arid areas of the 
‘Fertile  Crescent’  about  5000  BP  [7].  The  breed  is  pre- 
dominantly distributed in arid and semi-arid agro-ecologies 
of the Borana plateau. The small-sized Arsi cattle probably 
developed from a group of small short-horned Abyssinian 
zebu  by the  highland Oromo  people. The  Ambo cattle is 
grouped under Small East African zebu and is believed to 
have descended from the recent introductions of zebu into 
Africa [8]. Pictures of sampled animals are depicted in Fig. 2. 

Genotyping and quality control

In total, 192 animals representing 5 cattle populations of 
Ethiopia were genotyped for 8,773 SNPs with the Illumina 
Bovine 8K SNP BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) 
according  to  Illumina  protocols  [9].  Over  the  loci,  the 
average GenTrain score, 10% GenCall (10% GC) score, and 
50% GenCall (50% GC) score were 0.86, 0.87, and 0.83, 
respectively. In this experiment, about 99.91% of the mar-
kers identified had a GenTrain score greater than the mini-
mum acceptable value (0.25) (http://www.illumina.com). 
All of the samples had at least a 0.20 or greater 10% GC 
score, while the 50% GC score ranged from 0.75 to 0.91, with 
the  average  call  rate  of  0.913.  For  Hanwoo  cattle,  about 
51,162 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina Bovine 50K 
SNP BeadChip [10]. 8K and 50K genotypes were merged 
using  Golden Helix SNP Variation Suite software version 7 
(Golden  Helix,  Inc.,  Bozeman,  MT,  USA).  To  ensure  the 
highest quality of data from the 8K and 50K SNP BeadChips,

Finally about 7,045 SNPs that were common for both Bead-
Chips were subjected to analysis. Markers selected for diver-
sity  analysis  were  all  located  on  autosomal  chromoso-
mesand had at least an 80% call rate.

9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) procedure was used 
to test the effect of breed on MAF variation. Observed and 
expected heterozygosities and hierarchical F-statistics were 
estimated using GENALEX software [11]. 

Results and Discussion
MAF variation

The MAF for each SNP was calculated from the genotypic 
data and is presented in Table 2. Analysis of 7,045 markers 
revealed that the mean MAF was 0.23, 0.22, 0.21, 0.21, 0.23, 
and  0.29  for  Ambo,  Arsi,  Borana,  Danakil,  Horro,  and 
Hanwoo  cattle,  respectively.  A  significant  difference  was 
observed  between  the  Ethiopian  indigenous  cattle  popu-
lations  and  Hanwoo  (p  ＜ 0.001).  The  average  value  for 
Hanwoo was 32% higher than the value for Ethiopian cattle 
populations.  The  overall  MAF  in  the  present  finding  for 
indigenous Ethiopian cattle breeds is higher than an earlier 
report for indicine breeds but lower than the average value 
reported for most taurine breeds [3]. The value found for 
Hanwoo cattle was comparable with the previous results for 
taurine breeds but higher than the reported average for the

same breed [10, 12]. This could be attributed to the different 
marker density used, and a higher density marker (Illumina 
Bovine 50K SNP BeadChip) was used in the previous study. 
The higher values for taurine breeds can be explained by the 
fact that SNP loci used in this study were detected in taurine 
breeds, and their average minor allele frequency was much 
lower in indicine breeds. 

Across the Ethiopian cattle populations, common variant 
MAFs (≥0.10 and  ≤0.5) accounted for 74% of the total 
SNPs (Table 3). Hanwoo cattle displayed a higher proportion 
of common variant SNPs (90%). Rare variant MAFs were 
observed in about 9% and 4% of markers in the Ethiopian 
and  Hanwoo  breeds,  respectively.  The  relatively  higher 
proportion  of  fixed  alleles  in  Ethiopia  cattle  populations 
could  be  attributed  to  the  inbreeding  as  a  result  of  un-
controlled  breeding  practices.  A  common  variant  MAF 
proportion of 83% was reported in sheep breeds [5]. The 
distribution  of  MAFs  revealed  that  nearly  34.08%  of  the 
markers in Ethiopian cattle populations and 53% in Hanwoo 
cattle  displayed  a  high  degree  of  polymorphisms  (0.3  ≤ 
MAF ≤ 0.5). Yet, this value was higher than an earlier report 
both  for  Hanwoo  (25%)  and  Holstein  (28%)  [12].  Much 
higher MAFs were detected in Bos taurus breeds than in Bos 
indicus breeds [3]. The proportion of fixed markers varied 
among  the  sampled  populations.  Among  the  Ethiopian 
cattle populations, the highest (8.96%) and lowest (6.30%) 
were  obtained  in  the  Borana  and  Ambo  populations, 
respectively. The Hanwoo breed displayed a lower level of 
fixed SNPs (1.10%). 

On  average,  83.36%  of  the  markers  displayed  poly-
morphisms (MAF  ＞ 0.05) within Ethiopian cattle popu-
lations, and the remaining 16.64% of the SNPs considered as 
monomorphic.  The  Hanwoo  breed  showed  the  highest 
proportion of polymorphisms (94%) (Fig. 3). The level of 
polymorphic SNPs in the present study was higher than what 
was previously reported for taurine breeds [10]. But, it was 
in close agreement with the value reported for sheep breeds

using genome-wide SNPs [5]. Similarly, Gautier et al. [13] 
reported  a  lower  rate  of  polymorphisms  using  696  SNPs 
localized in BTA03 from European and West African cattle 
breeds (94.6% and 81.8%), respectively. The higher obser-
ved polymorphisms in Hanwoo cattle could explained by the 
fact that most of the bovine sequence data available in the 
database are from Bos taurus breeds.

Genetic diversity among Ethiopian cattle 
populations

An  examination  of  the  variability  within  breeds  was 
carried out to compare the level of hererozygosity between 
the populations, and the results are presented in Table 4. 
Across the sampled Ethiopian cattle populations, the mean 
observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.314 ± 0.001 
and 0.313 ± 0.001, respectively. The mean values were lower 
than  the  values  reported  from  a  microsatellite  markers 
analysis [1]. However, they were in concurrence with the 
values reported using SNPs for the Angus breed (0.332) [14] 
and for sheep breeds [5]. 

The  overall  estimated  F-statistics  were  FIS  =  －0.003 
(within-population inbreeding estimates) and FIT = 0.016 
(total inbreeding). Among the Ethiopian cattle populations, 
genetic  differentiation  (FST)  was  estimated  at  0.019.  Ge-

netic  characterization  of  Ethiopian  cattle  breeds  using 
microsatellites  reported  within-population  inbreeding  of 
0.071, total inbreeding of 0.083, and genetic differentiation 
of 0.013 [1]. The FST for Ethiopian cattle populations was 
low, which could be due to their common ancestral origin.
There  were  loci  significantly  deviating  from  HWE. 
Overall, significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg propor-
tions (p ＜ 0.05) was observed for 405 markers in Ethiopian 
cattle  populations  (Ambo,  441;  Arsi,  475;  Borana,  314; 
Danakil, 314; and Horro, 481) and in 549 of the markers in 
Hanwoo. The highest number of SNPs that departed from 
HWE was observed in Hanwoo cattle, whereas within the 
Ethiopia  cattle  populations,  Borana  displayed 
lower 
proportions of markers (SNPs) deviating from HWE. The 
variation in proportion of SNPs displaying deviation from 
HWE among the sampled populations could be explained by 
selection pressure and population structure (stratification, 
admixture).

In conclusion, a significant difference was detected for the 
rate of polymorphisms and MAFs between the Hanwoo and 
the  Ethiopian  cattle  populations.  The  level  of  variation 
identified  in  this  particular  study  highlights  that  these 
markers can be potentially used for genetic studies in African 
cattle populations. The high within-breed diversity observed

in  Ethiopian  indigenous  cattle  populations  could  be  an 
opportunity  and  allow  improvements  through  within- 
population selection schemes.
