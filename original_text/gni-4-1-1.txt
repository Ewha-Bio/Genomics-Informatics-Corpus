Abstract 
Epigenetic  alterations  are  common  features  of  human 
solid tumors,  though global  DNA methylation has been 
difficult to assess. Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning 
(RLGS) is one of technology to examine epigenetic alterations 
at several thousand No~ sites of promoter regions in tumor 
genome. To assess sequence infonnation for No~ sequences 
in RLGS gel, we cloned 1,161  unique No~-linked clones, 
compromising  about  60%  of  the  spots  in  the  soluble 
region of RLGS profile, and performed BLAT searches on 
the UCSC genome server, May 2004 Freeze. 1 ,023 (88%) 
unique sequences were matched to the CpG islands of 
human  genome showing  a  large  bias  of  RLGS  toward 
identifying potential  genes or CpG  islands.  The cloned 
No~-loci had a high frequency (71 %) of occurrence within 
CpG islands near the 5' ends of known genes rather than 
within CpG islands near the 3' ends or intragenic regions, 
making  RLGS  a  potent  tool  for  the  identification  of 
gene-associated  methylation  events.  By  mixing  RLGS 
gels with all  No~-linked clones,  we addressed 151  No~ 
sequences  onto  a  standard  RLGS  gel  and  compared 
them with previous reports from several types of tumors. 
We  hope  our  sequence  information  will  be  useful  to 
identify  novel  epigenetic  targets  in  any types  of tumor 
genome

Introduction 
CpG  islands  are  short  stretches  (500-2000  bp)  of 
genomic  DNA enriched  for the  dinucleotide,  5'-CpG-3', 
which is the substrate for methylation by DNA methyltrans(cid:173)
ferases.  While most CpG sites in  the human genome 
are methylated, those in CpG islands are typically unmethy(cid:173)
lated in nonnal tissue. In human cancers, de novo methylation 
of  CpG  island  sequences  is  accompanied  by  gene 
silencing and can serve as an alternative to mutation or 
deletion in the inactivation of tumor suppressor and other 
genes.  In fact,  over the past several years many studies 
have demonstrated that epigenetic alterations are responsible 
for  the  development  and  progression  of  the  human 
cancers (Jones and Baylin, 2002). 

The ubiquity of DNA methylation changes in  tumori(cid:173)
genesis has led to a host of innovative diagnostic and ther(cid:173)
apeutic strategies. Recent advances attest to the promise 
of DNA methylation markers as powerful tools for the clin(cid:173)
ic in the future.  For many epigenetically silenced genes, 
re-expression  in  tumor cells can  lead to suppression of 
cell  growth  or altered  sensitivity  to  existing  anticancer 
therapies, and small molecules that reverse epigenetic in(cid:173)
activation are now undergoing clinical trials in cancer pa(cid:173)
tients  (Momparler  eta/.,  1997;  Pohlmann  eta/.,  2002). 
Epigenetic changes have been detected in the peripheral 
blood  for almost every organ  in  cancer patients  (Laird, 
2003).  Thus,  epigenetic changes are not only potential 
therapeutic targets because of their reversibility, but also 
potential biomarkers that can be used to detect and diag(cid:173)
nose cancer in its earliest stage and to accurately assess 
individual risk (Brown and Strathdee, 2002). 

Restriction  landmark genomic scanning (RLGS)  is a 
highly reproducible two-dimensional gel electrophoresis 
of genomic DNA that allows the assessment of over 2000 
loci simultaneously, when a methylation sensitive enzyme 
Not! is used as the landmark enzyme (Hatada eta/., 1991). 
The technique has been used for various purposes including 
genetic  mapping,  identification  of  novel  imprinted  genes, 
genomic  amplifications,  regions  of  hypomethylation  or 
hypermethylation, candidate tumor suppressor genes, and 
measuring  the  degree  of CpG  island  hypermethylation  in 
cancer (Costello eta/., 2000; Hayashizaki eta/., 1993; Kim et 
"!'·, 2000; Miwa eta/., 1995; Nagai eta/., 1994; Okazaki eta/., 
1996; Okuizumi eta/., 1995; Plass eta/., 1996; Shibata eta/., 
1995). 

Although RLGS profiles can be generated from any high-

quality genomic DNA without prior sequence information, 
subsequent cloning  of  RLGS  fragments  is  essential  for 
future studies.  Several  PCR-based protocols have been 
developed allowing the identification of RLGS sequences 
(Ohsumi et at., 1995). More efficient, however, is a cloning 
strategy that uses an arrayed human library of Nod/ EccRV 
clones and  RLGS mixing gel  catalogs (Smiraglia  et at., 
1999). This protocol circumvents the need for PCR-based 
amplification,  which  could  be  problematic with  GC-rich 
sequences. Successful use of this library system resulted 
in the identification of many methylation targets in several 
human tumors (Costello et at.,  2000;  Rush  eta/., 2004; 
Smiraglia and Plass 2002). 

The  use  of  the  Nod/EcoRV  boundary  library  as  a 
cloning  tool  for  RLGS  has  a  limitation  in  covering  all 
Nott-linked  clones  because  the  spots  on  RLGS  gel 
originates from  Nott/ Nott  clones as well  as. Nott/ EcoRV 
clones.  To  increase  the  potential  coverage  of  CpG 
islands,  we  prepared a Nott/Nott  library in  addition to a 
Nott/EcoRV library and RLGS mixing gels that allow the 
efficient  recovery  of  the  cloned  RLGS  fragments.  We 
hope  that  this  novel 
the 
information  of  the  previous  Nott!EcoRV 
sequence 
library, will greatly increase the utility of RLGS.

Methods 
RLGSrun 
We isolated  high  molecular weight  DNA from  a normal 
stomach mucosa according to the standard protocol and 
performed RLGS as previously described (Hatada eta/., 
1991 ). Briefly, five p,g of genomic DNA was blocked in a 25 
Jd reaction by adding nucleotide analogs ([a-35S]-dGTP, [a 
35S]-dCTP,  ddATP,  and  ddTTP)  with  2.5  U  of  DNA 
-
polymerase  I  (TAKARA,  Japan)  for  20  min  at  37°C, 
followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 65°C for 30 min. 
The DNA was then digested with 50 units of Nott  (New 
England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich, MA). We used Sequenase 
Ver. 2.0 (USB, Cleveland, OH) to fill in the Nott ends with 
[a-32P]-dGTP (6,000 Ci/mmole;  NEN) and [a-32P]-dCTP 
(6,000 Ci/mmole;  NEN) for 30 min at 37°C and stopped 
the reaction by heating for 30 min at 65°C.  The labeled 
DNA was  then  digested  with  20  units  of  EcoRV  (New 
England Biolabs Inc.) and separated at 8 V/cm for 12 h 
in 0.8% SeaKem agarose gel (FMC) for first-dimensional 
separation. The DNA-containing agarose strip was in gel 
digested with 1 ,500 units of l:finfl (New England Biolabs 
Inc.)  for 2  h at 37°C.  The  agarose  strip  equilibrated  in 
buffer was then placed across the top of a non-denaturing 
5% polyacrylamide  gel,  connected  by  molten  qgarose, 
and followed by second-dimensional electrophoresis at 8 
V/cm for 7  h.  After separation,  the gels were dried and 

exposed to X-ray film (Kodak X-OMAT) in the presence of 
intensifying screens for 2-10 days. To find out which spot 
the  Nott/Nott 
originated 
fragments of the 1st dimension, DNA digested only with 
Nott enzyme and the mixed DNA containing both Nott and 
Nott/ EcoRV digested DNA were used for RLGS analyses. 

the  Nott!EcoRV  or 

from 

RLGS profile analysis 
Two RLGS profiles from  DNA digested only with  Nott 
enzyme and mixed DNA containing both Nott  and Nottl 
EcoRV digested DNA were overlaid, and the differences 
between the two profiles were detected by visual inspection 
and  independently  validated  by  two  investigators.  To 
exclude a difficulty due to high density or low resolution of 
spots  and  to  allow  the  uniform  comparison  of  RLGS 
profiles from different samples, we compared spots only 
on the central portion of the RLGS profile. 

Noll-linked DNA library construction. 
To  generate  Nott!EcoRV  and  Nott/Nott  libraries  as  a 
resource  to  facilitate  the  analysis  of  RLGS  loci,  one 
hundred p,g of normal mucosa tissue was doubly digested 
with  Nott/EcoRV  and  the  resulting  fragments  were 
purified by using the phenol/ethanol extraction method. 
First, to exclude EcoRV-EcoRV DNA fragments in DNA 
solution, :\-ZAPII DNA (22.12 kb) was digested with Nott 
enzyme and its Nott end was treated with CIP (TAKARA). 
The  :\-ZAPII/Nott  DNA was  ligated  with  genomic  DNA 
and  then  digested  with  EcoRV  to  separate  fragments 
ligated at EcoRV sites.  The mixtures were run  on 0.8% 
LMP agarose (FMC) gel and the portion of the gel over 22 
kb  was  eluted  and  purified  with  beta-agarase  I  (New 
England Biolabs Inc.). This DNA was digested with Nott, 
run on  1% LMP agarose gel, and fragments ranging 0.7 
to 4 kb were eluted by usinga Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). 
The  resulting  DNA  solution  was  then  divided  into  two 
tubes:  DNA fragments  from  one  tube  were  ligated  into 
pBiuescript KS  (+)DNA digested with  Nott  and  EcoRV 
and the other fragments were ligated into pBiuescript KS 
(+)  digested  only  with  Nott.  The  solutions  were 
transformed  into DH5a cells by electroporation.  Finally, 
we  prepared  two  kinds  of  Nott-linked  DNA  library, 
Nott/Nott DNA library ('NN') and Nott/EcoRV DNA library 
('NE')  of  0. 7  to  4  kb  fragments  comprising  the  central 
portion of the RLGS gel (Fig. 2). 

Isolation  of unique  Noll-linked  DNA and  BLAT 
search 
Plasmid DNAs from all clones of NN and NE libraries 
were isolated by using a MWG plasmidprep 96 (MWG 
Biotech.). Sequencing reactions were performed on a 

Cloning of Non-linked DNA on RLGS gel  3 

GeneAmp PCR System 9700 thermal  reactor (Perkin(cid:173)
Elmer Corp.) by using a BigDye Terminator Sequencing 
kit with T7 sequencing primer to get Notl end sequences. 
After  removing  the  unincorporated  dye terminator,  the 
reaction  products were run  on an ABI  prism 3700  DNA 
analyzer  (Perkin-Elmer  Corp.).  DNA  sequences  were 
assembled to isolate unique Notl-linked clones by using 
DNAST AR software.  BLAT search for unique sequences 
were performed on the UCSC genome server,  May ~~004 
Freeze (http://genorne.ucsc.edu/cgi-binlhgBiat) to determine 
whether the  sequences  fall  in  a  known  CpG  island  or 
reported gene region. 

Addressing of unique Noll-linked clones onto 
RLGSgel 
Plasmid DNAs with  unique Notl-linked sequences were 
arrayed into 12 96-well microtiter plates for their use in the 
RLGS  mixing  gels.  The  DNAs  were  pooled  in  three 
different  ways:  by  plate,  by  row,  and  by  column,  as 
described  previously  (Smiraglia  et a/.,  1999).  ThH  96 
plasmid  DNAs from  each  of the  12 plates were  pooled 
into 12 microtubes. The 8 rows (A-H) from each of the 12 
plates  were  also  pooled  into  new  microtiter  plates  by 
using a 12-channel pipette and finally transferred into 8 

microtubes. The 12 columns (1-12) from each of the 12 
plates  were  similarly  pooled  by  using  an  8-channel 
pipette and finally transferred into 12 microtubes. In total, 
32 pooled DNAs were labeled according to the standard 
RLGS  procedure  and  mixed  with  the  labeled  genomic 
DNA when the first dimensional agarose gel was loaded. 
The  standard  RLGS  procedure  described  above  was 
continued. 

Results and Discussion 
We generated a standard RLGS profile for DNAs from a 
normal mucosa and divided the profile into 30 sections to 
allow  a  uniform  comparison  of  RLGS  profiles  from 
different  samples.  Then  each  fragment  was  given  a 
three-variable designation  (Y coordinate,  X coordinate, 
fragment number). The central region of the RLGS profile 
had  30  sections  (18  vertically  and  A-D  horizontally), 
containing 1,948 spots (Fig. 1A). The 1A and 2A sections 
were excluded because there was no fragment in those 
sections.  A  standard  RLGS  profile,  on  which  individual 
is  available  at 
spot  number  was  assigned  and

fragments (Noti!EccR.Vor Noll/Noli) ranging from 0.7 to 4 kb 
were selected  and  ligated  into  a  pBiuescript  KS  (+)vector to 
establish Noli/ Noli or Notl/ EccR.V libraries 

We found that 404 spots in the central  portion of the 
standard  RLGS  profile  originated  from  Notl!Notl  DNA 
fragments (Fig. 1 B). Most of the Not1/ Not1  DNA fragments 
reappeared  in  the  RLGS  profile  originated  from  Not1/ 
EcoRV DNA fragments (Fig.1 C). This result indicates that 
20.7% (404 of 1948 spots) on the standard RLGS profile 

originated  from  Noll/ Not1  DNA  fragments  and  that 
Not1/Not1  DNA fragments are also important parts of the 
Not1/EcoRV DNA fragments. To identify Not1/Not1 as well 
as Not1/ EcoRV DNA fragments as a resource to facilitate 
the analysis of RLGS loci, we established an 'NN library' 
and an 'NE library' containing Not1/Not1  and Not1/EcoRV 
fragments ranging from 0.7 to 4 kb (Fig. 2). We collected 
a total of 5,255 white colonies, of which 4,328 were from 
the  NE  library  and  927  from  the  NN  library,  and 
determined  their  Not1-end  sequences.  All  Not1-end 
sequences were assembled to select unique sequences 
by  using  DNASTAR  software.  Totally  1,161  unique 
sequences  (or clones)  were isolated;  1,051  sequences 
were isolated from the NE library and  110 from the NN 
library.  The  sequence  data  were  submitted  to  NCBI 
GenBank as accession numbers CG464575-CG465835. 
The  average  insert  size  for  unique  clones  was 
approximately 1.5 kb (n = 860) ranging from 0.7 to 4 kb and 
average read length was 423 bp. The unique clones were 
estimated to cover 60% of the 1,948 RLGS spots (Table 
1 ). To identify potential genes or CpG islands linked with 
the above 1,161  unique sequences, we performed BLAT 
searches on the UCSC genome server, May 2004 Freeze 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBiat). 1 ,023 (88%) unique 
sequences were matched to UCSC CpG islands,  of which 
919 {87%) were derived from NE clones and 104 (95%) 
from NN clones. We also found that 646 (70%) sequences 
matched to UCSC CpG islands were in the 5'end of genes, 
136 (15%) were in the 3' end of genes, and 27 (3%) were 
intragenic regions, and 110 (12%) were not linked to any 
gene. This result is similar to the previous report that 8,239 
(86%) of 9,628 Not1  sites estimated from human genome 
draft sequence  were  linked  to  CpG  islands  (Dai  et a/.,

2002), showing a large bias of RLGS toward identifying 
potential genes or CpG islands. It is worthy to note that the 
Non-loci  we  cloned  have  a  high  frequency  (71 °/c,)  of 
occurrence within CpG islands near the 5' ends of known 
genes rather than within CpG islands near the 3' ends or 
intra-genic regions, thus making RLGS a potent tool for 

the identification of gene-associated methylation events. 
Several  groups  generated  RLGS  profiles  from  many 
types of cancer and reported interesting genes (Costello 
eta/., 2000;  Smiraglia  eta/.,  1999; Zardo  eta/.,  2002). 
However,  because  previous  studies  used  only  Non! 
EcoRV DNA fragments for mixing gel catalog, they have 

8  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  4(1) 1-10, March 2006 

limitations in  identifying novel  epigenetic targets.  Thus, 
our Notl-linked sequences including Noti/Notl as well as 
Noti/EcoRV  DNA  fragments  may  be  helpful  to  give 
additional information on  RLGS study. 

To  identify  each  unique  Notl-linked  clone  on  the 
RLGS gel, all unique clones were arrayed into 12 96-well 
microtiter plates and  RLGS  mixing  gels were  prepared 
from  plates  1  to  12.  Notl/ Notl  clones  from  multi-copy 
rONA were excluded in this step because the positions of 
Notl/ Notl  fragments  derived  from  genomic  rONA  are 
already known (Kuick eta/., 1996). The rows and columns 
from these 12 plates were individually pooled to produce 
mixing  gels  as  previously  described  (Smiraglia  et  a/., 
1999). In total, 32 RLGS mixing gels were produced. In the 
RLGS  mixing gels,  spots will  be shown  as enhanced  if 
the corresponding clone is present in the pool  of clones 
mixed with the genomic DNA.  The determination of the 
plate,  row,  and  column  of  the  mixing  gels in  which  the 
RLGS spot of interest is enhanced indicates the address 
of  the  unique  clone  in  which  the  corresponding  RLGS 
fragment was cloned. 

Table  2.  shows  the  sequence  information  for  151 
unique clones identified by using the RLGS mixing gels. 
We compared the spot positions in this study to the master 
RLGS profiles in previous work (Costello eta/., 2000) and 
the methylated RLGS spots found in various tumor types 
in previous literatures. Costello eta/. (2000) have shown 
that 4C06,  3871, 6005, and  4884 (3060, 3C02,  5E12, 
and 4805 in Master RLGS) were CpG islands affected in 
at  least  three  different  tumor  types:  4C06  in  colon 
carcinoma, glioma, and acute myeloid leukemia; 3871  in 
colon  carcinoma,  head  and  neck  squamous  cell 
carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia; 6005 in breast 
carcinoma, glioma, and acute myeloid leukemia; 4884 in 
breast  carcinoma,  colon  carcinoma,  and  glioma.  They 
have also shown that 3880, 6C26, 4851  and 5084 (3C17, 
5013, 3C67 and 4F55 in Master RLGS) were affected at 
a  high  frequency  in  one  tumor type  but  infrequently  in 
others, thus suggesting that some CpG-island targets are 
methylated in a tumor-type specific manner while others 
are  shared  by  multiple  tumor  types.  In  addition,  the 
methylation of 4C55, 5C1 0, 5C30, 2C46, 3843, 3879 and 
3813  have  been  found  in  hepatocellular  carcinoma 
(Nagai eta!., 1994); the methylation of6D27 and 3085 in 
lung carcinoma (Smiraglia eta!., 2001;  Oai  eta/., 2001); 
the  methylation  of  4863  and  3085  in  acute  myeloid 
leukemia (Rush eta/., 2001 );  the methylation of 2816 in 
glioma (Nakamura eta/., 1997); the methylation of 6C26, 
3085 and 5806 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rush et 
a/., 2004); the methylation of 4A44 and 3813 in renal cell 
carcinoma  (Cho  et a/.,  1998).  Aberrant  methylation  of 
CpG islands containing the promoters of cancer-related 

genes is often  associated with  transcriptional  inactivation 
(Baylin eta/., 1998; Jones and Laird, 1999). The methylated 
CpG  islands in various tumors cloned  here may be  novel 
epigenetic targets for the corresponding tumors,  because 
no  information  on  them  has  been  found  in  literatures. 
Thus, it is required to determine whether the methylation 
events reported  here have an  impact on transcription of 
those genes. 

In conclusion, we assessed sequence information for 
Notl  sequences  on  a  standard  RLGS  gel.  We  cloned 
1 ,023 individual Notl-linked sequences matched to CpG 
islands of human genome,  showing a high frequency of 
occurrence within CpG islands near the 5' ends of known 
genes rather than within CpG islands near the 3' ends or 
intra-genic regions.  This information is available for the 
identification of gene-associated methylation events. We 
also provide 151  Notl  sequences onto a standard RLGS 
gel with previous methylation events from several type of 
tumor. Therefore, our sequence information may be very 
useful to identify novel epigenetic targets in many tumor 
types.
