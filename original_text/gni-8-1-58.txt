Abstract

CpG  is  the  pair  of  nucleotides  C  and  G,  appearing  suc-
cessively,  in  this  order,  along  one  DNA  strand.  It  is 
known  that  due  to  biochemical  considerations  CpG  is 
relatively  rare  in  most  DNA  sequences.  However,  in  par-
ticular  subsequences,  which  are  a  few  hundred  to  a  few 
thousand  nucleotides  long,  the  couple  CpG  is  more 
frequent.  These  subsequences,  called  CpG  islands,  are 
known  to  appear  in  biologically  more  significant  parts  of 
the  genome.  The  ability  to  identify  CpG  islands  along  a 
chromosome  will  therefore  help  us  spot  its  more  sig-
nificant  regions  of  interest,  such  as  the  promoters  or 
'start'  regions  of  many  genes.  In  this  respect,  I  devel-
oped 
Islands 
Detector,  which  was  implemented  in  JAVA  to  be  run  on 
any  platform.  The  window-based  graphical  user  inter-
face  of  CpG  Islands  Detector  may  facilitate  the  end  user 
to  employ  this  tool  to  pinpoint  CpG  islands  in  a  ge-
nomic  DNA  sequence.  In  addition,  this  tool  can  be  used 
to  highlight  potential  genes  in  genomic  sequences  since 
CpG  islands  are  very  often  found  in  the  5'  regions  of 
vertebrate  genes.

Introduction

CpG  dinucleotide  is  remarkably  underrepresented  in  ver-
tebrate  genomes.  In  the  human  genome,  for  example, 
its  frequency  is  five  times  less  than  statistically  ex-
pected 
the  nucleotide 
composition.  The  depletion  of  CpG  dinucleotides  is 
caused  by  the  spontaneous  deamination  of  methylated

cytosines  to  yield  thymine  and  generate  a  T:G  mismatch 
that  will  be  fixed  as  TpG  (or  CpA  on  the  complementary 
strand)  if  the  thymine  is  not  repaired  by  cytosine  before 
the  next  round  of  DNA  replication  (Lander et al.,  2001; 
Sved  and  Bird,  1990;  Venter  et al.,  2001).  However, 
there  are  genomic  regions  rich  in  CpG  dinucleotides, 
termed  CpG  islands,  where  the  level  of  methylation  is 
significantly  lower  than  the  overall  genome.  In  these  re-
gions,  the  occurrence  of  CpGs  is  significantly  higher, 
close  to  the  expected  frequency.  The  existing  CpG  is-
lands  are  traditionally  thought  to  be  unmethylated. 
However,  many  CpG  islands  were  subsequently  found 
to  be  hypermethylated  in  the  imprinted  genes  (Jones 
and  Baylin,  2002).  It  is  now  known  that  some  CpG  is-
lands  in  non-imprinted  regions  are  also  methylated  in 
normal  cells  and  this  is  believed  to  be  related  to  tis-
sue-restricted  gene  expression  patterns  (Grunau  et al., 
2000;  Song et al.,  2005).  A  large  number  of  methylated 
CpG  islands  are  also  found  in  tumor  cells  (Jones  and 
Baylin,  2002).
    Most  CpG  islands  are  found  at  significant  regions  of 
interest,  such  as  the  promoters  or  'start'  regions  of 
many  genes.  The  CpG  islands  that  are  located  upstream 
of  the  transcription  start  site  are  critical  in  gene  ex-
pression  regulation  and  cell  differentiation  (Bird,  2002). 
They  are  usually  an  important  signature  of  the  5'  region 
of  many  mammalian  genes,  often  overlapping  with,  or 
within,  a  thousand  bases  downstream  of  the  promoter. 
The  identification  of  promoters  by  CpG  islands  with  a 
resolution  of  2  KB  may  be  most  useful  for  large-scale 
sequence  annotation.  Visual  inspection  of  CpG  islands 
is  often  used  for  gene  identification  by  many  molecular 
biologists.  In  a  word,  searching  CpG  islands  are  very 
important  from  various  aspects.  In  this  respect,  I  devel-
oped  the  CpG  islands  search  tool,  CpG  Islands  Detec-
tor,  which  can  be  used  for  CpG  islands  determination. 
This  tool  is  a  window-based  Java  application  im-
plemented  with  JBuilder  9.0  which  is  a  Java  IDE 
(Integrated  Development  Environment).  There  are  several 
computer  programs,  including  CpG  Island  Searcher 
(Takai  and  Jones,  2002)  and  CpGIF  (Ye  et al.,  2008), 
which  search  genomes  for  CpG  islands  and  are  avail-
able  on  the  Web.  Their  simple  and  limited  interfaces 
mean  that  users  are  unable  to  capitalize  on  the  pro-
grams  by  using  them  to  find  out  the  best  parameters  - 
parameters  which  would  allow  users  to  locate  all  of  the 
CpG  islands  and  none  of  the  junk.

Overview  and  features  of  CpG  Islands 
Detector

Search  criteria  and  algorithm

The  first  large-scale  computational  analysis  of  CpG  is-
lands  using  vertebrate  gene  sequences  in  GenBank  was 
performed  by  Gardiner-Garden  and  Frommer  in  1987 
(Gardiner-Garden  and  Frommmer,  1987).  As  defined  by 
Gardiner-Garden  and  Frommer  (Gardiner-Garden  and 
Frommer,  1987),  CpG  islands  are  greater  than  200  bp  in 
length,  have  more  than  50  percent  of  G+C  content,  and 
have  a  ratio  of  CpG  frequency  to  the  product  of  the  C 
and  G  frequencies  above  0.6.  Over  time,  the  criteria  for 
a  CpG  island  have  evolved.  Currently,  the  generally  ac-
cepted  criteria  have  become  more  stringent,  requiring  a 
minimum  DNA  sequence  length  of  500  bp.  The  im-
portance  of  these  criteria  lies  in  that  they  are  able  to 
exclude  most  Alu  repeats,  which  were  identified  as  CpG 
islands  by  the  old  criteria.  Takai  and  Jones  proposed 
more  stringent  criteria,  with  G＋C  content  and  observed 
CpG/expected  CpG  ratio  (ObsCpG/ExpCpG)  increased  to 
55%  and  0.65  respectively,  which  would  be  more  effec-
tive  in  excluding  Alu  repeats  (Takai  and  Jones,  2002). 
The  criteria  used  in  this  work  basically  comply  with 
those  defined  not  only  by  Gardiner-Garden  and  From-
mer  but  also  by  Takai  and  Jones.
    In  this  work,  a  sliding  200  base  pair  window  algorithm 
was  fundamentally  applied  to  the  CpG  Islands  Detector. 
Even  though  the  algorithm  was  designed  according  to 
the  criteria  of  CpG  islands  described  by  Gardiner- 
Garden  and  Frommer,  two  more  parameters  - NCpG  and 
Vgap  were  introduced  in  this  work.  NCpG  and  Vgap  mean 
the  number  of  CpGs  in  the  200  bp  and  the  value  of  the 
gap  between  successively  adjacent  CpG 
islands 
respectively.  NCpG  was  used  to  exclude  “mathematical 
CpG  islands”.  A  200  bp  sequence  containing  one  G, 
150?Cs,  and  only  one  CpG,  which  would  meet  the  cri-
teria  of  a  CpG  island,  can  become  an  example  of 
“mathematical  CpG  islands”.  That  is,  there  must  be  at 
least  seven  CpGs  in  200  bp.  This  number  was  selected 
on  the  basis  that  there  would  be  200/16  (i.e.  12.5)  CpGs 
in  a  random  DNA  fragment  containing  no  suppression  of 
CpG.  Because  Gardiner-Garden  and  Frommer's  criterion 
of ObsCpG/ExpCpG  of  0.6  would  accommodate  (0.6×12.5) 
CpGs  (i.e.,  7.5),  seven  CpGs  were  regarded  as  being  a 
reasonable  cutoff.  Vgap  was  adopted  to  extend  single 
stretch  meeting  the  criteria  of  CpG  island  by  means  of 
merging  two  immediately  adjacent  CpG  islands.  The 
CpG  search  algorithm  can  be  summarized  as  following 
(Fig.  1):
    (A) Set  a  sliding  window  of  200  bp  in  the  beginning 

of  a  Contig.

    (B) Shift  the  window  1  bp  after  evaluation  until  the 
window  meets  the  criteria  (G＋C  %,  ObsCpG/
ExpCpG,  and,  NCpG)  of  a  CpG  island.
If  the  window  meets  the  criteria,  shift  the  window 
200  bp,  then  evaluate  again  and  repeat  these  200 
bp  shifts  until  the  window  does  not  meet  the 
criteria.
If  the  last  window  in  the  step  C  does  not  meet 
the  criteria,  shift  the  last  window  1  bp  toward  the 
5’  end  until  it  meets  the  criteria.
If  the  right  end  of  the  last  window  reaches  the 
end  of  the  Contig,  go  to  the  step  F.  Otherwise, 
set  a  200-base  window  in  the  position  where  3? 
end  of  the  last  window  was  located  and  repeat 
the  step  B  through  D.

    (F) Two  immediately  adjacent  CpG  islands  are  con-

G＋C  %  plotting  module  and  graphical  user  in-
terface

The  nuclear  genomes  of  vertebrates  are  mosaics  of  iso-
chores,  very  long  stretches  (＞300  kb)  of  DNA  that  are 
homogeneous  in  nucleotide  composition  and  are  com-
positionally  correlated  with  the  coding  sequences  that 
they  embed.  Isochores  can  be  partitioned  in  a  small 
number  of  families  that  cover  a  range  of  G＋C  levels, 
which  is  narrow  in  cold-blooded  vertebrates,  but  broad 
in  warm-blooded  vertebrates.  The  G＋C  %  plotting  can 
give  a  clue  to  discriminating  the  promoter  and  coding

regions  from  intron  sequences.  In  this  respect,  the  mod-
ule  for  G＋C  %  plotting  was  brought  in  CpG  Islands 
Detector  in  order  to  facilitate  the  end  user  to  discrim-
inate  promoter-associated  CpG  island  from  non-pro-
moter  associated  CpG  island.  The  module  plots  G＋C 
content  within  a  sliding  window  that  steps  along  the  se-
quences  at  a  specified  shift.  Like  GpG  islands  Detector, 
it  also  allows  user-defined  parameters  (i.e.,  window  size 
and  step  size)  so  that  the  user-defined  window  is 
moved  down  the  sequence  by  specified  step  size.  The 
G＋C  content  is  calculated  and  plotted  at  each  central 
position  that  the  window  is  moved  to  (Fig.  2).
    Window-based  graphical  user  interface  enables  users 
to  change  the  preset  default  parameter  values  into  the 
ones  tailored  to  their  analysis  intent  (i.e.  variable  limit  of 
G＋C  %,  ObsCpG/ExpCpG,  length,  NCpG,  and  Vgap)  (Fig. 
2).  The  user  can  get  the  summary  of  analysis  result  on 
the  left  panel  of  graphical  user  interface  which  includes 
three  main  spreadsheets  -  sequence  input,  CpG  island 
parameters  and  G＋C  %  parameters.  In  addition,  the 
user  can  get  the  detailed  information  (i.e.,  length,  coor-
dinate  (start  and  end),  G＋C  %)  on  a  CpG  island  de-
tected  by  CpG  Islands  Detector  through  pop-up  window 
(front  window  in  the  Fig.  2)  by  double-clicking  on  the 
corresponding  CpG  island.  The  input  sequence  can  be 
directly  cut  and  pasted  into  the  edit  box  or  be  uploaded 
from  a  file.  Both  of  FASTA  format  and  plain  text  format 
are  allowed  for  the  input  sequence.  The  analysis  output 
looks  like  the  one  in  Fig.  2.  The  upper  part  of  the  analy-
sis  output  displays  the  detected  CpG  islands  and  the 
lower  part  displays  the  G＋C  %  plot.  An  example  se-
quence  (ID:  EPI_7031)  derived  from  EPD  (Eukaryotic 
Promoter  Database)  was  used  to  be  analyzed  in  Fig.  2.

Discussion

Any  definition  of  a  CpG  island  is  somewhat  arbitrary  but 
it  is  a  recent  trend  that  more  stringent  criteria  are  used 
for  determination  of  CpG  islands.  While  CpG  islands 
meeting  the  stringent  criteria  are  more  likely  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  the  5'  regions  of  genes  and  the  criteria  can 
exclude  most Alu-repetitive  elements,  using  the  stringent 
criteria  may  deteriorate  the  sensitivity  of  detection. 
Considering  all  of  these,  search  algorithm  in  this  work 
was  allowed  to  user  defined  lower  limits  of  parameters 
for  the  initial  scanning  of  a  submitted  sequence  to  avoid 
missing  any  CpG  islands.  Using  a  larger  window  size 
potentially  allows  the  extraction  of  CpG  islands  which 
could  not  be  extracted  with  a  smaller  window  size. 
Since  our  first  priority  for  this  algorithm  is  not  to  miss 
any  sequences  meeting  the  criteria,  the  initial  result 
might  differ  from  the  perception  of  the  user.  The  user 
can  pinpoint  the  CpG  island  region  using  a  larger  G＋C 
%,  ObsCpG/ExpCpG  and  smaller  length  after  the  initial 
search.  Ultimately,  using  the  parameters  defined  by  the 
user,  CpG  Islands  Detectors  searches  for  all  potential 
CpG  islands  and  maps  them  on  the  input  sequence 
graphically.  Furthermore,  users  can  get  the  related  in-
formation  such  as  parameter  values  and  subsequence 
on  a  CpG  island  by  double-clicking  on  it.  In  conclusion, 
this  tool  can  facilitate  users  to  pinpoint  CpG  islands  in 
a  genomic  DNA  sequence  and  also  to  highlight  potential 
genes  by  means  of  promoter-associated  CpG  islands. 
However  it  will  be  needed  additional  studies  on  parame-
ters  optimization  that  can  maximize  sensitivity  and  spe-
cificity  of  this  application.
