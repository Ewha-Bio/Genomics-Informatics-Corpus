Abstract

Intron  prediction  is  an  important  problem  of  the  con-
stantly  updated  genome  annotation.  Using  two  model 
plant  (rice  and Arabidopsis)  genomes,  we  compared  two 
well-known  intron  prediction  tools:  the  Blast-Like  Align-
ment  Tool  (BLAT)  and  Sim4cc.  The  results  showed  that 
each  of  the  tools  had  its  own  advantages  and  disadvan-
tages.  BLAT  predicted  more  than  99%  introns  of  whole 
genomic  introns  with  a  small  number  of  false-positive 
introns.  Sim4cc  was  successful  at  finding  the  correct  in-
trons  with  a  false-negative  rate  of  1.02%  to  4.85%,  and 
it  needed  a  longer  run  time  than  BLAT.  Further,  we 
evaluated  the  intron  information  of  10  complete  plant 
genomes.  As  non-coding  sequences,  intron  lengths  are 
not  limited  by  a  triplet  codon  frame;  so,  intron  lengths 
have  three  phases:  a  multiple  of  three  bases  (3n),  a 
multiple  of  three  bases  plus  one  (3n  +  1),  and  a  multiple 
of  three  bases  plus  two  (3n  +  2).  It  was  widely  accepted 
that  the  percentages  of  the  3n,  3n  +  1,  and  3n  +  2  in-
trons  were  quite  similar  in  genomes.  Our  studies  showed 
that  80%  (8/10)  of  species  were  similar  in  terms  of  the 
number  of  three  phases.  The  percentages  of  3n  introns 
in  Ostreococcus lucimarinus  was  excessive  (47.7%), 
while  in  Ostreococcus tauri,  it  was  deficient  (29.1%). 
This  discrepancy  could  have  been  the  result  of  errors  in 
intron  prediction.  It  is  suggested  that  a  three-phase 
evaluation  is  a  fast  and  effective  method  of  detecting  in-
tron  annotation  problems.

Keywords:  intron  length  distributions,  intron  prediction, 
plant,  three  phases

Introduction

With  more  and  more  species’  genomes  completely  se-
quenced,  noncoding  sequences  have  become  a  focus  of 
researchers’  attention,  especially  for  the  study  of  introns. 
In  order  to  facilitate  further  research,  a  number  of  intron 
databases  have  been  developed  (Table  1).  The  number 
of  plant  intron  databases  is  much  smaller  than  that  in 
mammals  and  only  in  several  model  plants  (such  as 
Arabidopsis  and  rice).  Using  known  genome  sequences 
and  coding  sequences  (expressed  sequence  tags  [ESTs] 
or  cDNA),  introns  can  be  detected  by  aligning  coding 
sequences  with  genome  sequences.  Many  tools  were 
developed  to  detect  introns  in  eukaryotes  (Table  2) 
[1-16].  These  tools  used  different  algorithms  and  com-
puter  languages  (such  as  Java,  C++,  and  Python)  to 
predict  introns. 
    Therefore,  the  question  is:  there  are  many  intron  data-
bases,  algorithms,  and  detection  methods  for  the  study 
of  eukaryotes,  but  which  among  them  are  the  most  suit-
able  for  the  detection  of  plant  introns?  Among  these 
tools,  the  Blast-Like  Alignment  Tool  (BLAT)  and  Sim4cc 
are  the  most  commonly  used  tools.  BLAT  applies  in  ge-
nomewide  alignment  [11].  Sim4cc  is  a  tool  for  aligning 
cDNA  and  genomic  sequences  between  species  at  vari-
ous  evolutionary  distances  [2].  Rice  and Arabidopsis,  as 
monocotyledonous  and  dicotyledonous  model  plants,  are 
widespread  with  regard  to  in-depth  research.  Their  ge-
nome  sequences  have  been  annotated  in  detail,  includ-
ing  their  gene  sequences,  complementary  DNA  (cDNA) 
sequences, coding DNA sequence (CDS) sequences, exon 
sequences,  intron  sequences,  and  intergene  sequences. 
Therefore,  it  is  possible  to  use  this  model  plant  infor-
mation  to  test  these  intron  prediction  tools.
    Genome  annotation  is  a  difficult  and  accurate  project- 
even  the  best-annotated  or  most  carefully  studied  ge-
nomes  are  continually  re-released;  e.g.,  release  7  of  the 
Rice  Genome  Annotation  Project  was  available  on  Octo-
ber  31,  2011  (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/).  But,  de-
termining  the  accuracy  and  detecting  the  inherent  errors 
of  the  genome  annotation  is  a  problem.  Since  introns  are 
removed  from  protein-coding  transcripts,  intron  lengths 
are  not  expected  to  respect  coding  frames  across  the 
genome  [17].  Using  intron  length  distributions,  Roy  and 
Penny  [18]  point  out  a  rapid  and  simple  method  for  de-

tecting  a  variety  of  possible  systematic  biases  in  gene 
prediction  or  even  problems  with  genome  assemblies. 
Roy’s  method  showed  that  a  good  genome  annotation 
is accepted as roughly equal proportions of intron lengths 
of  three  phases:  a  multiple  of  three  bases  (3n),  one 
more  than  a  multiple  of  three  bases  (3n  +  1),  and  two 
more  (3n  +  2).  Skewed  predicted  intron  length  distribu-
tions  thus  suggest  systematic  errors  in  intron  prediction. 
But,  many  plants  with  sequenced  genomes  have  not 
been  commented  on. 
    In  this  study,  we  compared  the  advantages  and  dis-
advantages  of  BLAT  and  Sim4cc  for  model  plants’  in-
tron  predictions,  and  we  attempted  to  find  a  better  way 
to  predict  the  intron  information  of  plants.  Based  on 
Roy’s  method,  we  evaluated  the  intron  information  of  10 
plant  genomes  and  discuss  a  skew  in  genome  wide  in-

tron  length  distributions  that  indicates  systematic  prob-
lems  with  intron  predictions.

Methods

Genome  sequences

Ten  plant  genome  sequences  and  transcript  (EST,  CDS, 
or  cDNA)  sequences  were  downloaded  and  indicated  in 
Table  3  [19-27].  Table  3  contains  the  name  of  the  10 
plant  species,  source  websites,  and  genome  sequence 
versions  used  in  this  study.

Comparative  BLAT  and  Sim4cc  analysis

Intron  length  distributions  analysis

Using  cDNA  sequences  and  gene  sequences,  we  sear-
ched  rice  and  Arabidopsis  introns  by  two  methods 
-BLAT  and  Sim4cc-  and  then  compared  the  results  with 
annotated  information. 
    The  steps  of  this  method  are  as  follows  (Fig.  1):  1) 
Using  the  gene  sequences  of  BLAT  with  its  own  cDNA 
sequences,  we  found  intron  information  from  the  BLAT 
results  by  Perl  script.  2)  We  sliced  gene  sequences  and 
cDNA  sequences  to  folders  by  Perl  script.  In  these  fold-
ers,  there  was  one  sequence  per  file,  and  the  gene  name 
was  the  file  name.  Using  the  same  gene  name  of  the 
gene  and  cDNA  file,  we  blasted  the  gene  sequences 
and  cDNA  sequences  using  Sim4cc.  Then,  we  got  intron 
information  from  the  Sim4cc  results  by  Perl  script.  3) 
We  compared  the  results  of  the  two  types  of  software 
(BLAT  and  Sim4cc)  and  then  got  the  annotated  intron 
information.  4)  We  aligned  intron  sequences  with  their 
own  gene  sequences  to  develop  detailed  intron  infor-
mation,  such  as  the  intron  position  in  the  gene,  intron 
length,  intron  number,  forward-exon  length,  and  back-
ward-exon  length,  etc.  5)  We  compared  the  results  from 
the  two  types  of  software  with  the  annotated  informa-
tion  to  validate  the  methods.

Using  Perl  script,  we  extracted  the  intron  information  of 
the  10  plant  genomes  from  the  genome  annotation. 
Then,  we  counted  the  number  and  percentage  of  3n,  3n 
+  1,  and  3n  +  2  of  these  10  plants’  intron  length 
distributions.

Results  and  Discussion

A  comparison  of  BLAT  and  Sim4cc

As  a  prerequisite,  it  was  assumed  that  the  intron  anno-
tated  information  was  correct  and  complete.  Then,  the 
software’s  results  were  compared  with  the  annotated 
information.  Three  sets  of  results  of  intron  information 
were  obtained:  two  sets  from  the  software  (BLAT  and 
Sim4cc)  and  one  set  from  the  annotated  information 
(Table  4). 
    Using  BLAT,  we  found  99.35%  and  99.87%  of  the  in-
trons  of  all  rice  and  Arabidopsis  annotated  introns, 
respectively.  These  introns  were  almost  all  of  the  introns 
in  the  genome  -  that  is,  only  0.13%  to  0.65%  of  the  in-
trons  were  not  found.  In  contrast,  by  using  Sim4cc, 
95.15%  to  98.98%  of  the  introns  were  found  (1.02%  to

4.85%  of  the  introns  were  lost)  of  all  rice  and Arabidop-
sis annotated  introns.  In  summary,  BLAT  got  more  of 
the  introns  in  a  genome  than  Sim4cc.  In  light  of  this  re-
sult,  it  seems  as  though  that  BLAT  produces  better  re-
sults  than  Sim4cc. 
    We  found  30,194  rice  genes  with  at  least  one  intron 
by  BLAT,  but  the  number  was  30,177  according  to  the 
annotated  information.  Because  the  BLAT  results  were 
larger  than  the  annotated  results,  the  BLAT  results  must 
have  predicted  some  new  and  different  genes  with 
introns.  In  the  BLAT  results,  many  short-length  introns 
(less  than  50  bp)  were  predicted,  but  in  fact,  these 
short-length  introns  were  part  of  transcript  sequences 
and  were  not  real  intron  sequences.  In  contrast,  Sim4cc 
detected  29,875  genes  with  introns,  and  all  of  these 
genes  were  contained  in  the  annotation  information.  The 
predicted  intron  accuracy  rate  of  Sim4cc  was  100%.  On 
accuracy,  Sim4cc  was  better  than  BLAT.
    If  Sim4cc  is  used,  the  user  has  to  splice  a  whole  ge-
nome  file  to  many  files:  one  gene,  one  file.  The  comput-
ing  process  of  Sim4cc  was  more  complex  than  that  of 
BLAT,  and  each  time,  Sim4cc  only  calculated  one  cDNA 
sequence  to  one  gene  sequence;  so,  the  executing  effi-
ciency  and  speed  are  not  high.  In  comparison,  BLAT 
was  easier  and  faster  than  Sim4cc. 
    In  conclusion,  BLAT  and  Sim4cc  can  be  used  to  pre-
dict  introns,  but  each  of  them  has  its  advantages  and 
disadvantages.  The  comparative  results  are  summarized 
in  Table  5.  Sim4cc  was  a  cross-species  spliced  align-
ment  program.  In  our  study,  Sim4cc  was  used  to  find 
introns  by  comparing  cDNA  sequences  and  gene  se-
quences.  The  correct  intron  can  be  obtained  by  com-
paring  one  cDNA  sequence  with  its  own  gene  sequence. 
But,  a  lot  of  introns  were  lost  by  Sim4cc.  In  other  words, 
Sim4cc  was  good  at  detecting  the  correct  intron  but  not 

at  predicting  the  whole  number  of  introns  in  a  genome. 
In  contrast,  BLAT  can  predict  most  of  the  introns  - 
nearly  all  of  the  total  introns  in  a  genome.  But,  there 
were  some  false-positive  predictions  of  introns.  However, 
the  proportion  of  this  error  was  very  small.  As  a  result, 
BLAT  will  be  proposed  to  annotate  plant  genome  introns. 

Intron  length  distribution  of  10  plants

According  to  Roy’s  method,  many  predicted  introns  in 
the  plant  genomes  had  in-frame  stop  codons,  and  the 
predicted  introns  in  these  genomes  were  equally  as  likely 
to  be  a  multiple  of  3  bp  (3n)  as  to  contain  a  plus  one 
(3n  +  1)  or  two  (3n  +  2)  bp.  Here  was  an  example  of 
from  an  Arabidopsis  thaliana  gene, 
three  phases 
AT1G17600.1  (Fig.  2). 
    By  analyzing  genome  sequence  annotations,  we  got 
three-phase  intron  distributions  for  10  plant  species 
(Table  6).  If  the  plant  intron  annotation  is  more  accurate, 
the  number  of  three  phases  should  be  similar  (one-third 
each).  For  80%  (8/10)  of  species,  there  were  similar 
numbers  of  the  three  phases.  It  should  be  noted  that 
most  of  these  plant  species  annotations  were  the  best 
annotations  to  date,  but  new  annotations  will  be  con-
tinually  released  to  correct  errors  and  false-positive 
results. 

Two-species  3n  intron  skew  analysis

For  all  of  the  10  genomes  (Table  6),  there  were  very 
similar  numbers  of  3n  +  1  and  3n  +  2  introns,  and  the 
percentages  of  3n  +  1  and  3n  +  2  introns  were  within 
0.8%.  In  contrast,  the  number  of  3n  introns  varied  much 
more  widely,  from  29.1%  to  47.7%.  In  this  study,  two 
species’  genome  introns  showed  strongly  skewed  per-

in-frame  stop  codons  and  thus  does  not  interrupt  the  open  reading  frame.  Intron  3  is  a  74-bp  intron  (3n  +  1)  with  three  stop 
codons.

centages,  in  that  the  3n  intron  percentage  was  much 
lower  or  higher  than  the  expected  value  (one-third).  Such 
a  skew  suggests  systematic  errors  in  the  intron  predic-
tion. 
    The  green  alga Ostreococcus lucimarinus has  one  of 
the  highest  gene  densities  known  in  eukaryotes,  with 
many  introns  [28].  There  was  a  striking  excess  of  pre-
dicted  3n  introns  (47.7%  of  all  predicted  introns,  1,130) 
compared  to  3n  +  1  (25.8%,  611)  and  3n  +  2  (26.5%, 
628)  introns.  In  this  case,  many  predicted  3n  introns 
were  not  true  introns  but  instead  exons. 
    The  unicellular  green  alga  Ostreococcus tauri is  the 
world’s  smallest  free-living  eukaryote  known  to  date  [29]. 
These  predicted  introns  showed  a  deficit  of  3n  introns 
(29.1%,  1,262),  much  lower  than  3n  +  1  (35.8%,  1,553) 
and  3n  +  2  (35%,  1,519)  introns.  This  result  is  very  close 
to  previous  studies  [18].  In  this  case,  3n  introns  may  be 
mistakenly  regarded  as  coding  sequences,  whereas  a 
3n  +  1  or  3n  +  2  intron  may  be  inferred  from  the  dis-
ruption  of  the  coding  frame. 

Concluding  remarks

By  comparing  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of 
BLAT  and  Sim4cc  in  intron  prediction,  we  found  that 
BLAT  is  faster  and  can  predict  more  introns  than  Sim4cc. 
Through  using  intron  length  distribution  to  detect  in-
trons’  annotations,  it  is  a  simple  and  fast  method  for 
detecting  a  variety  of  possible  systematic  biases  in  in-
tron  prediction  or  even  for  detecting  problems  with  ge-
nome  assemblies.
