Abstract
The  Functional  Element  SNPs  Database  (FESD) 
categorizes functional elements in human genic regions 
and provides a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) located within each area. Users may select a set 
of SNPs in specific functional elements with haplotype 
information and obtain flanking sequences for genotyping. 
Our  previous  version  of  FESD  has  been  improved  in 
several ways. We regenerated all the data in FESD II from 
recently updated source data such as HapMap, UCSC 
GoldenPath, dbSNP, OMIM, and TRANSFAC®. Users can 
obtain information about tagSNPs and simulate LD blocks 
for each gene from four ethnicities in the HapMap project 
on the fly. FESD II employs a Java/JSP web interface for 
better platform portability and higher speed than PHP in 
the previous version. As a result, FESD II provides its users 
with more powerful information about functional element 
SNPs of human ethnicities.

Introduction
Extensive studies are currently being conducted to find 
associations of disease susceptibility with a particular form 
of genetic variation, namely, single nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs), as well as with other types of common genetic 
variations,  including  microsatellites  and  copy  number

variants (Stranger, Forrest et al. 2007). Even though SNPs 
are  less  polymorphic  and  thus  less  informative  than 
microsatellite markers, SNPs are abundant (more than 12 
million in humans), more stably inherited, and exist in 
functioning regions such as exons. Thus, investigation of 
the genome for SNPs may be an effective way to elucidate 
the causes of complex phenotypes and diseases in humans.
The database of SNPs (dbSNP, http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/projects/SNP/), a repository for single-base nucleotide 
substitutions and short deletion and insertion polymorphisms 
(Sherry, Ward et al. 2001), contains over 12 million human 
SNPs and an additional 22 million from a variety of other 
organisms, with 14 million of those added over the past 
year (Wheeler, Barrett et al. 2007).

As the number of SNPs deposited in dbSNP has been 
increasing  exponentially,  many  researchers  who  are 
interested in complex genetic diseases are focusing on 
candidate gene approaches using gene-based functional 
element SNPs and haplotypes, which are collections of 
SNPs  located  throughout  the  functional  regions  of 
candidate genes (Ring and Kroetz 2002; Jung, Park et al. 
2004). Linkage disequilibrium (LD), which refers to the 
nonrandom  association  of  alleles  at  different  loci  in 
haplotypes, plays a central role in genome-wide association 
studies  for  identifying  genetic  variation  with  different 
phenotypes  (Zhang,  Qin  et  al.  2004).  A  tagSNP  is  a 
representative SNP in a region of the genome with high LD. 
Researchers can use tagSNPs to discover genes responsible 
for certain disorders. Most genome-wide association studies 
currently underway will not be well powered for rare causal 
SNPs. For such studies, we can impute unobserved HapMap 
SNPs with tag SNPs (Marchini, Howie et al. 2007), reducing 
the time and labor spent choosing tagSNPs instead of all the 
variations in a sequence.

Most SNP genotyping methods currently in use begin 
with a PCR amplification step and need PCR primers 
(Nothnagel, Furst et al. 2002). In high-throughput SNP 
genotyping machines, the primers often include not only 
PCR primers but also extension primers (Wise, Paris et 
al. 2003). For the design of PCR primers, researchers need 
to  prepare  flanking  sequences  of  their  target  SNPs. 
Although the dbSNP database provides flanking sequences 
for  each  refSNP,  the  length  of  flanking  sequences  is 
variable and is often not long enough to design primers. 
There may be many different methods to obtain the flanking 
sequence, such as using the UCSC genome browser or by 

NCBI  blast  search.  However,  these  methods  require 
multiple steps and do not support multiple queries (Kent, 
Sugnet et al. 2002; Karolchik, Hinrichs et al. 2004).

We developed and reported the Functional Element 
SNPs Database (FESD), which categorizes functional 
elements in human genic regions and provides a set of 
SNPs located within each area (Kang, Choi et al. 2005). 
In the FESD, human genic regions were divided into 10 
different  functional  elements:  promoter  regions,  CpG 
islands, 5’-untranslated regions (UTRs), translation start 
sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop 
sites,  polyadenylation  signals  (PASes),  and  3’-UTRs. 
Subsequently, all known SNPs were assigned to each 
functional  element  at  its  respective  position.  With  the 
FESD web interface, users can select a set of SNPs in 
specific functional elements and obtain flanking sequences 
for further genotyping experiments.

In this study, we have revised and updated the previous 
version of FESD by incorporating the International HapMap 
Project data with 270 samples. Users can obtain not only 
updated  functional  element  SNPs  but  also  haplotype 
information with tagSNPs. FESD II will serve as a much 
more versatile tool that aids users in finding mutations that 
contribute to common and polygenic diseases.

Updated Functional Element SNPs Database 
II (FESD II)
FESD categorizes functional elements in human genic 
regions and provides a set of SNPs located within each 
functional element as well as flanking sequences required 
for  genotyping  experiments  (Kang,  Choi  et  al.  2005). 
Through the FESD web interface, users can identify the 
functional position of SNPs and select a set of SNPs for 
their haplotype-based study. 

FESD  II  was  improved  in  many  aspects.  First,  we 
regenerated all data in FESD II from recently updated 
source data such as HapMap, UCSC GoldenPath, dbSNP, 
OMIM, and TRANSFAC®. The reference sequences of the 
human genome build 36.2 (April 2007) were downloaded 
from the NCBI database, and functional element sequences 
were  extracted  from  sequence  boundary  information 
derived from UCSC database hg 18 version (Karolchik, 
Baertsch et al. 2003). Among the 16 tracks within Genes 
and Gene Prediction Tracks in the UCSC database, the 
RefSeq Gene track was produced from mRNA sequence 
data (Maglott, Ostell et al. 2005). We used the 25,313 
refSeq IDs in the refGene track. In total, 11,811,594 SNPs 
from the dbSNP database build 127 were positioned with 
the flat file downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih. 
gov/snp/human/). In particular, the matrix data of transcription 

FESDII: A Functional Element Human SNP Database 189

factor estimation were updated from TRANSFAC® professional 
ver. 7.4.1 to ver. 11.1.

Second, the dbSNP data were included, as were the 
International HapMap Project phase I and phase II data 
with 270 samples (Nigerian Yoruba African, Han Chinese, 
Northern and Western European, and Japanese populations), 
allowing users to gain information about LD blocks and 
tagSNPs from each population. The LD block of each gene 
is simulated at on time in FESD II, helping users obtain 
haplotype information in order to select a set of SNPs in 
specific functional elements and to have tagSNPs with 
certain coverages. The LD blocks were generated by the 
Haploview program (Barrett, Fry et al. 2005). Moreover, 
the tagSNPs of each gene from these four populations 
were  also  provided.  We  adopted  algorithms  from  the 
Tagger program (de Bakker, Yelensky et al. 2005) to select 
and evaluate tagSNPs.

Third,  we  transformed  the  computer  program  into 
Java/JSP, which supports better platform portability and 
higher speeds than did PHP in the previous version.

The human genome has two different regions―genic 
and intergenic. The genic region can be divided into 10 
different  functional  elements;  promoter  regions,  CpG 
islands, 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs), translation start 
sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop 
sites, polyadenylation signal sites (PASes), and 3'UTRs. 
Promoter  regions  were  estimated  in  the  2-kb  region 
upstream of the start codon using a transcription factor 
matrix, and CpG islands found in the promoter regions were 
reported. Detailed information on the 10 functional regions 
can be gleaned from our previous paper (Kang, Choi et al. 
2005); the 10 functional regions are depicted in the Fig. 1.
SNPs whose locations are known were assigned to the 
corresponding functional element. To estimate the promoter 
region, we used the Match program (TRANSFAC Professional 
11.1), which is a weight matrix-based tool for searching 
putative transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences 
(Kel, Gossling et al. 2003). The SNPflank database consists 
of the complete genome sequence from RefSeq genome 
contigs and the positional information of refSNPs from the 
dbSNP database (Benson, Karsch-Mizrachi et al. 2004). 
Both were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site, parsed with

Functional elements are divided into 10 different functional regions:
promoter regions, CpG islands, 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs), 
translation start sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation
stop sites, polyadenylation signal sites (PASes) ,and 3'UTRs.

FESD II provides capabilities in searching for genes in 
several ways: gene  name, mRNA  accession number, 
protein accession number, LocusLink ID, OMIM ID, position 
on chromosome, clinical disorder, clinical synopsis, cytogenetic 

band position, and transcription factor name. Fig. 2 shows 
the main page of FESD II (Fig. 2 - A) and the steps taken 
to search for detailed information on SNPs, using BRCA1 
as an example (Fig. 2 - B). The result shows the refGene

the intergenic region contains 5,609,193 (51.5%). While 
there are slightly more SNPs in the intergenic region, the 
SNP density of the genic region is higher than that of the 
intergenic region. Total genome length was calculated to 
be 3,903,120,360 bp (http://www.ensembl.org). Table 1 
shows the distribution of SNPs throughout 10 functional 
elements. Most SNPs in the genic region were distributed 
in introns (94.1% of total genic SNPs). The sum total of 
SNPs from 5’ UTR to 3’ UTR was 5,931,208, which is 
slightly less than the SNP count from the genic region. This 
slight difference is due to the overlapping physical positions 
of  promoter  regions  and  CpG  islands.  We  estimated 
promoters in the 2 kb upstream from the start codon, and 
searched CpG islands in the estimated promoter regions. 
Therefore,  the  promoter  region  may  overlap  with  an 
upstream gene, and for same reason, CpG islands can overlap.
The density of SNPs in each chromosome is shown in 
Table 2. In the promoter regions, CpG islands, 3'UTRs, 
5'UTRs, coding exons, and introns, the average densities 
of SNPs were relatively higher than in other regions such 
as translation start sites, splice sites, translation stop sites, 
and PASes.

Conclusion
We have revised and updated our previous FESD in three 

ways. First, we have regenerated all the source data with 
recently updated databases. FESD II provides up-to-date 
information  on  functional  element  SNPs.  Second,  we 
simulated the LD blocks of each gene independently for 
the four ethnicities, based on International HapMap data 
(http://www.hapmap.org/). The LD blocks of each gene 
can be simulated at on time, and users can confirm the 
ethnic variation of SNP haplotypes with the data. Third, we 
ported the FESD from PHP to Java/JSP for higher performance.
