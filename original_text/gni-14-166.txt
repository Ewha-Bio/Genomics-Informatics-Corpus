Although  a  large  number  of  genetic  variants  have  been  identified  to  be  associated  with  common  diseases  through 
genome-wide association studies, there still exits limitations in explaining the missing heritability. One approach to solving 
this missing heritability problem is to investigate gene-gene interactions, rather than a single-locus approach. For gene-gene 
interaction analysis, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method has been widely applied, since the constructive 
induction  algorithm  of  MDR  efficiently  reduces  high-order  dimensions  into  one  dimension  by  classifying  multi-level 
genotypes  into  high-  and  low-risk  groups.  The  MDR  method  has  been  extended  to  various  phenotypes  and  has  been 
improved  to  provide  a  significance  test  for  gene-gene  interactions.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  simple  method,  called 
accelerated  failure  time  (AFT)  UM-MDR,  in  which  the  idea  of  a  unified  model-based  MDR  is  extended  to  the  survival 
phenotype by incorporating AFT-MDR into the classification step. The proposed AFT UM-MDR method is compared with 
AFT-MDR through simulation studies, and a short discussion is given.

Introduction

For  the  past  several  decades,  many  statistical  methods 
have been developed to detect genetic variants in genome- 
wide association studies (GWASs) [1], since high-throughput 
genotyping  technologies  have  provided  a  large  scale  of 
genetic  information,  such  as  microarray  expression  data, 
single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNP),  copy  number 
variants, and so forth. In most early GWASs, a single-SNP 
approach  was  widely  used  to  identify  genetic  variations 
associated with common and complex diseases, because it is 
relatively easy and efficient to estimate and test the effect of 
genetic variants. However, this single-SNP approach yields 
the missing heritability problem [2], because many complex 
diseases are naturally related to multiple genes and their 
interactions, rather than a single-SNP. Thus, many approa-

ches for solving the missing heritability problem have been 
studied, such as meta-analysis, analysis of rare variants from 
next-generation  sequencing,  and  analysis  of  gene-gene 
interactions. This paper focuses on the analysis of gene-gene 
interactions  associated  with  the  survival  phenotype  in 
prospective studies. Since the analysis of gene-gene inter-
actions involves high-dimension variables, the method for 
reducing  high-dimension  to  lower-dimension  variables  is 
practically useful to estimate the effects of genes and their 
interactions with the appropriate models.

As  a  strategy  to  reduce  the  dimension  of  high-order 
variables, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) 
method has been proposed by Ritchie et al. [3], in which 
multi-level genotypes are efficiently reduced into a binary 
attribute to detect non-linear patterns of gene-gene interac-
tions in GWASs. The MDR method originally was proposed 
for a binary phenotype in a case-control study, and it is a

nonparametric  and  genetic  model-free  approach.  The  key 
idea of MDR is to classify multi-dimensional genotypes into 
one-dimensional binary attributes by pooling genotypes of 
multiple SNPs using a well-defined statistic, such as the ratio 
of cases and controls. Many modifications for MDR have 
been  proposed  by  generalizing  the  binary  phenotype  to 
quantitative traits and survival time with various classifiers. 
For  example,  Lou  et  al.  [4]  proposed  a  generalized  MDR 
(GMDR),  which  includes  both  binary  and  continuous 
phenotypes  and  uses  a  score-based  residual  to  classify 
multi-level  genotypes  into  high-  and  low-risk  groups.  In 
addition, the GMDR allows for the adjustment of covariates, 
such as many demographic variables. 

In addition, the constructive induction algorithm of MDR 
has also been extended to investigate gene-gene interactions 
associated with the survival phenotype. Gui et al. [5] first 
proposed  a  novel  approach,  called  Survival-MDR  (Surv- 
MDR), for  detecting  gene-gene  interactions with  survival 
times  using  the  combinatorial  algorithm  of  MDR.  The 
Surv-MDR method replaces case-control ratios by a log-rank 
test statistic with survival time. Thus, the balanced accuracy 
is  replaced  by  a  log-rank  test  statistic,  but  the  other 
cross-validation procedure for selecting the best model is 
unchanged. It has been shown that Surv-MDR has better 
power  than  traditional  Cox  regression  models  through 
intensive simulation studies. Also, Surv-MD has success-
fully  identified  the  SNP-SNP  interactions  associated  with 
survival time in bladder cancer data, as shown in Andrew et 
al.  [6].  However,  there  exists  a  weakness  of  Surv-MDR, 
which can not adjust the effect of the covariate, because it 
uses the log-rank test statistic as a classifier. 

To overcome the disadvantage of Surv-MDR, Lee et al. [7] 
proposed a simple method, called Cox-MDR, which uses a 
martingale  residual  as  a  classifier  and  allows  for  the 
adjustment of covariates. Similarly, Oh and Lee [8] proposed 
another method, called AFT-MDR, which uses a standar-
dized residual as a new classifier. In an accelerated failure 
time  model,  the  standardized  residual  is  the  normalized 
difference between the observed log survival time and the 
expected log survival time under the assumed model. Thus, 
it can be interpreted that a positive standardized residual 
implies a longer survival effect, while a negative standar-
dized residual implies a shorter survival effect than expected. 
It is reasonable to classify subjects into high- and low-risk 
groups by the standardized residual, since it can be inter-
preted as a measure of association between putative genetic 
factors  and  survival  time.  Furthermore,  AFT-MDR  can 
adjust for the effect of covariates under the framework of the 
accelerated failure time regression model, unlike Surv-MDR. 
However, both Surv-MDR and AFT-MDR only provide the 
best  pair  of  SNPs,  which  is  selected  by  10-fold  cross-

validation, and the significance of a gene-gene interaction is 
achieved by intensive permutations. Recently, Yu et al. [9] 
proposed a unified model-based MDR (UM-MDR) method 
to  overcome  the  disadvantage  of  MDR,  which  needs 
permutation tests for the significance of the effect of the best 
pair of SNPs. The UM-MDR method includes two steps for 
investigating  gene-gene  interactions,  in  which  multi- 
dimensional genotypes are classified into high- and low-risk 
groups,  and  then,  an  indicator  for  the  high-risk  group  is 
defined in the first step. In the second step of the UM-MDR 
method,  the  indicator  variable  for  the  high-risk  group  is 
considered a covariate, with other adjusted covariates in the 
regression  model.  Then,  the  significance  of  a  gene-gene 
interaction is obtained by testing the indicator variable of the 
high-risk group. 

Through simulation studies, we compared the proposed 
method with AFT-MDR with and without the main effect 
using 70 different penetrance models listed by Velez et al. 
[10]. From the simulation results, the power of the proposed 
method is similar to that of AFT-MDR when the main effect 
is  not  considered,  but  it  performs  better  than  AFT-MDR 
when the censoring fraction is greater than 0.3. In addition, 
the power of the proposed method is much greater than that 
of  AFT-MDR  when  the  main  effect  is  considered,  while 
AFT-MDR has no power when there is a strong main effect. 
The power of the proposed method also decreases as the 
censoring fraction increases.

Methods

Let Ti denote the survival time for the ith individual and xi 
and  zi  denote  the  predictor  variable  vector  coding  a 
gene-gene and gene-environment interaction of interest and 
the vector coding for the covariates, respectively. Let β and 
γ be  the  corresponding  parameter  vectors  to  xi  and  zi, 
respectively. Then, we call β the target effects and γ the 
covariate  effects.  The  parametric  regression  model  repre-
sents the linear relationship between the log survival time 
and covariates as follows:

Y = logT = μ ＋ β'X ＋ γ'Z ＋ σW.

Here, μ is the mean value of the log survival time when 
X  =  Z  =  0,  σ is  a  scale  parameter,  and  W  is  the  error 
distribution. When T has a Weibull distribution, W has a 
standard  extreme  value  distribution.  For  a  log-logistic 
distribution, W has a standard logistic distribution. 

The  standardized  residual  for  the  ith  individual,  si  =

difference between the observed and expected survival time 
under the null model with no SNP effects, the magnitude and 
sign of the standardized residual provide a measure of the 
association between SNPs and survival time. Those patients 
who have positive standardized residuals are at low risk for 
the  disease,  because  one  survives  longer  than  expected 
under the null model. Similarly, those patients who have 
negative  standardized  residuals  are  at  high  risk  for  the 
disease, because one dies earlier than expected. Thus, each 
individual with a positive standardized residual is classified 
as  a  control,  whereas  one  with  a  negative  standardized 
residual  is  classified  as  a  case.  In  addition,  for  each 
multi-locus genotype combination of SNPs, we calculate the 
sum of the standardized residuals of those patients who have 
the  corresponding  genotype  and  replace  the  case-control 
ratios  with  the  sum  of  the  standardized  residual  to 
discriminate between high- and low-risk groups. We assign 
the  cell  as  low-risk  if  the  sum  of  standardized  residuals 
within that cell is greater than or equal to 0 and as high-risk 
otherwise. The process of AFT-MDR is done by following the 
algorithm  of  the  original  MDR  through  10-fold  cross- 
validation to select the best pair of SNPs.

We  propose  to  improve  the  process  of  AFT-MDR  by 
combining  the  unified  model-based  MDR  to  test  the 
significance of gene-gene interactions. In the first step of the 
proposed method, multi-level genotypes are classified into 
high-risk and low-risk groups, as done in AFT-MDR. Then, 
we define an indictor variable, S, as 1 for the high-risk group 
and  0  otherwise.  In  the  second  step,  the  variable  S  is 
considered  with  the  other  adjusting  covariates  in  the 
accelerated failure time regression model. The testing for the 
significance of S implies that there is a significant gene-gene 
interaction  associated  with  survival  time.  For  testing  the 
significance of S, a Wald-type test statistic is used, and its 
asymptotic distribution is a chi-square distribution under 
the null hypothesis of no gene-gene interaction. However, as 
described in Yu et al. [9], the asymptotic distribution of the 

Wald-type test statistic is not a central chi-square distribu-
tion, because the expectation of the test statistic is not 0 
under the null hypothesis. To adjust for the bias of the test 
statistic, non-centrality is estimated by a small number of 
permutations—say, 5 or 10 times. Based on the non-central 
chi-square  test  statistic,  the  significance  of  a  gene-gene 
interaction  can  be  tested  for  all  possible  pairs  of  SNPs 
without any intensive permutations. The proposed method 
easily tests the significance of a gene-gene interaction for all 
possible higher-order pairs of SNPs in the framework of a 
regression model. It allows for the adjustment of covariates 
and the main effect of SNPs, while the original MDR method 
cannot. 

Results

A simulation study was performed to compare the power 
of the proposed method with that of AFT-MDR in the setting 
constructed similarly to that of Oh and Lee [8]. We consider 
two disease-causal SNPs among 10 unlinked diallelic loci 
with  the  assumption  of  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  and 
linkage equilibrium. For the simulation study, survival time 
is  generated  from  an  accelerated  regression  model  as 
follows:

log(T) = μ ＋ βfij ＋ γZ ＋ σW,

where fij = P(high risk|SNP1 = i, SNP2 = j), Z∼N(0,1), W∼
N(0,1). Here, fij is an element from the ith row and the jth 
column  of  a  penetrance  function,  which  defines  a  pro-
babilistic  relationship  between  a  status  of  high-risk  or 
low-risk and SNPs. We consider 14 different combinations of 
two different minor allele frequencies of (0.2 and 0.4) and 
seven different heritabilities of (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 
0.3,  and  0.4)  and  70  epistatic  models  with  70  various 
penetrance functions, as described by Velez et al. [10]. We 
also consider four censoring fractions (0.0, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5).

We  generate  200  high-risk  patients  and  200  low-risk 
patients from each of the 70 penetrance models to create one

we check whether or not a type-I error is well preserved 
under the null hypothesis. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, 
there  are  two  kinds  of  type-I  errors:  uncorrected  and 

corrected. The uncorrected type-I error is obtained from the 
asymptotic  central  chi-square  distribution,  whereas  the 
corrected  type-I  error  is  calculated  from  the  non-central 
chi-square distribution. For the non-centrality parameter, 5

AFT-MDR,  accelerated  failure  time  multifactor  dimensionality  reduction;  MAF,  minor  allele  frequency;  Cf,  censoring  fraction.

0.3. The results of Table 1 show that the type-I error is well 
controlled over all combinations of minor allele frequencies 
and censoring fractions. Fig. 1 displays the result of Table 1.
For the comparison of power, we define two powers, PBonf 
and PRank. PBonf is the proportion of p-values less than the 
nominal sizes after adjusting for multiple testing among 100 
cases. However, the power of AFT-MDR is defined as the 
percentage of times that it correctly chooses the disease- 
causal  model  out  of  each  set  of  100  datasets.  Thus,  we 
comparably  define  the  power  of  the  proposed  method  as 
PRank, which is estimated as the percentage of times that the 
causal model has the smallest  p-value out of all  possible 
multi-locus models. We compared these three powers in the 
simulation study. In addition, we simulated two different 
scenarios according to the main effect. 

In the first scenario, we consider the model without any 
main effect of SNPs; Fig. 2 and Table 2 display the power of 
the  PBonf,  PRank,  and  AFT-MDR  methods  over  various 
combinations  of  two  different  minor  allele  frequencies, 
seven different heritabilities, and four different censoring 
fractions. As indicated in Fig. 2, PRank is greater than PBonf 
and the power of AFT-MDR for all cases, whereas the power 
of AFT-MDR is less than PBonf, although the difference is 
smaller, as the censoring fraction is larger than 0.5. The trend 
of  these  three  powers  is  similar,  in  the  sense  that  they 
increase as the heritability increases, whereas they decrease 
as the censoring fraction increases. In addition, it is shown 
that  the  power  is  relatively  larger  when  the  minor  allele 
frequency (MAF) is 0.2 than when the MAF is 0.4. When the 
heritability is smaller than 0.1, the power is not larger than 
0.3, but PRank rapidly increases as the heritability is greater 

than 0.1, but both PBonf and the power of AFT-MDR slowly 
increase. 

On the other hand, in the second scenario, we generated 
the survival time by considering the main effect of SNP3 as 
follows: 

log(T) = μ ＋ βfij ＋ γZ ＋ αSNP3 ＋ σW.

After classifying the high-risk and low-risk groups by the 
standardized residual, as done in AFT-MDR, the indicator 
variable  for  the  high-risk  group,  S,  is  defined,  and  the 
significance of the gene-gene interactions between SNP1 and 
SNP2 is tested under the following model:

log(T)  = μ ＋ β1SNP1 ＋ β2SNP2 ＋ δS ＋ γZ ＋ σW.

From the simulation results, the power of PBonf, PRank, 
and AFT-MDR is similarly obtained and displayed in Fig. 3 
and Table 3.

As shown in Fig. 3, the power of AFT-MDR is almost 0 for 
all cases, whereas PRank shows a similar trend, as shown in 
Fig. 2, when the main effect is not considered. However, the 
size of PBonf is also smaller, as shown in Fig. 2, and has 
almost no power when the MAF is 0.4 and censoring fraction 
is larger than 0.1. The effect of the censoring fraction is much 
larger  on  these  three  powers  when  the  main  effect  is 
considered. Comparing PRank with the power of AFT-MDR, 
AFT-MDR  hardly  detects  any  interaction  effect  when  the 
main effect of SNPs is considered in the model. However, 
PRank has slightly moderate power when MAF is 0.2 and the 
censoring fraction is smaller than 0.5.

AFT-MDR,  accelerated  failure  time  multifactor  dimensionality  reduction;  MAF,  minor  allele  frequency;  Cf,  censoring  fraction. 

Discussion

In this study, the AFT UM-MDR method was proposed by 
extending the UM-MDR method to the survival phenotype. 
In the first step, the standardized residual of the accelerated 

failure  time  model  is  used  to  classify  the  multi-level 
genotypes into high-risk and low-risk, as done in AFT-MDR, 
and a binary variable is defined for indicating the high-risk 
group. Then, in the second step, the significance test for an 
indicator for the high-risk group, defined in the first step, is

conducted in the framework of the regression model, as done 
in UM-MDR. The big advantage of the proposed method 
over  AFT-MDR  is  that  it  can  test  the  significance  of 
gene-gene  interactions  without  intensive  permutation 
procedures.  Thus,  the  computing  time  is  substantially 
reduced, and it is also flexible enough to consider the main 
genetic effect, as well as gene-gene interactions, in a model. 
Throughout  the  simulation  studies,  it  is  shown  that  the 
proposed method performs better than AFT-MDR for both 
with  and  without  the  main  effect.  These  powers  tend  to 
increase as the heritability increases but decrease as MAF 
changes from 0.2 to 0.4 and the censoring fraction increases. 
Especially, the power of AFT-MDR is almost 0 under a model 
with  a  main  effect,  which  implies  that  the  gene-gene 
interaction can not be detected by AFT-MDR when any main 
genetic  effect  exists.  On  the  other  hand,  the  proposed 
method still detects gene-gene interactions, even when there 
is  any  main  genetic  effect.  Interestingly,  the  censoring 
fraction critically affects the power when the main effect is 
considered, because the trend of the three powers seems to 
be robust over the censoring fraction when the main effect is 
not considered, as shown in Fig. 2. 

As mentioned in Yu et al. [9], the UM-MDR is very flexible 
in the sense that various classification rules can be applied. 
We have an ongoing study in extending the UM-MDR to the 
Cox model, in which the martingale residual of a Cox model 
is used as a classification rule, as done in Cox-MDR.
