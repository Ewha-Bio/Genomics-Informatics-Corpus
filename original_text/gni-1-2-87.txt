Abstract 

DNA  microarray  is  currently the  most  prominent  tool  for 
investigating  large-scale  gene  expression  data.  Different 
algorithms  for  measuring  gene  expression  levels  from 
scanned  images  of  microarray  experiments  may 
significantly impact the following steps of functional genomic 
analyses.  Affymetrix®  recently  introduced  high-density 
microarrays and new statistical algorithms in Microarray Suit 
(MAS)  version  5.0®.  Very  high  correlations  (0.92  - 0.97) 
between  the  new  algorithms  and  the  old  algorithms  (MAS 
4.0)  across  several  species  and  conditions  were  reported. 
We  found  that  the  column-wise  array  correlations  had  a 
tendency  to  be  much  higher than  the  row-wise  gene 
correlations,  which  may be  much  more  meaningful  in  the 
following  higher-order  data  analyses  including  clustering 
and  pattern  analyses.  In  this  paper,  not  only  the  detailed 
comparison  of  the  two  sets  of  algorithms  is  illustrated,  but 
the impact of the  introducing new algorithms on  the further 
clustering analysis of microarray data and of possible pitfalls 
in  mixing  the  old  and  the  new  algorithms  were  also 
described.

Accepted 15 November 2003 

DNA microarray is currently the most prominent and widely 
accepted  tool  for  investigating  genomic-scale  expression 
data  in  an  extraordinarily  efficient fashion.  Increasing 
number  of  high  throughput  gene-expression  monitoring 
technologies  are  now  available.  Moreover,  there  have 
been  series of efforts to  share  microarray experiment data 
from  different  experiments  (Brazma  et a/.,  2001;  Edgar et 
a/.,  2002; Gardiner-Garden and Littlejohn,  2001; Strausberg 
eta/. 2001 ). 

One  important  issue  is  that  there  are  already  several 
technologies  for  large-scale  assays  of  gene  expression 
without well-established  way of cross-platform  utilization of 
data  from  different technologies  (Kuo  et at.,  2002). 
Combining expression measurements across technologies 
was  shown  to  be  non-trivial  (Aach  et at.,  2000).  The  ratio 
form  of measurements for eDNA microarray complicates a 
direct  comparison  with  results  from  other  technologies 
because  of  the  inevitable  dependence  of  the  ratio  values 
on the reference sample (Aach eta/., 2000). 

Affymetrix®  recently  introduced  new  statistical 
algorithms  with  Microarray  Suite  (MAS)  version  5.0®  for 
monitoring  GeneChip®  expression  data.  The  new 
algorithms  provide  statistical  significance  (p-values)  and 
confidence limits for log ratio values (fold changes), tunable 
parameters that enable users to vary the stringency of the 
analyses  as  well  as  elimination  of  negative  expression 
values  observed  with  the  old  empirical  algorithms 
(http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/technotes/stat 
istical_algorithms_technote.pdf and  http://www.affymetrix. 
com/support/technical/technotes/statistical_reference_guid 
e.pdf). 

The  algorithms  were  changed  from  the  old  empirical to 
the  new statistical ones and  the  terminology was  adapted 
to  fit  more  standard  terms.  The  AvgDiff  (Average  Differ(cid:173)
ence) that had been used for empirical expression analysis 
was changed to the  'Signal'  . The Signal is calculated using 
the  One-Step  Tukey' s Biweight  Estimate,  which  yields  a 
robust  weighted  mean  that  is  in  relatively  sensitive  to 
outliers. The Tukey'  s biweight method gives an estimate of 
the  amount  of  variation  in  the  data,  exactly  as  standard 
deviation measures the amount of variation for an average. 
MAS  5.0 subtracts  a  'stray signal'  estimate  from  the  PM 
(Perfect Match)  signal  that is based  on the  intensity of the 
MM  (Mis-Match)  signal.  However,  in  cases  where the  MM 
signal  outweighs the PM signal,  an adjusted value is used. 

88  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1(2) 87-93,  December2003 

These  adjustments  will  eliminate  negative  values.  The 
AbsCall  is  now  replaced  by the  Detection  value,  which  is 
associated  with  a Detection  p-value  based  on  a ranking 
user-defined value. 

Affymetrix®  reported  very  high  correlations  (0.92-0.97) 
between  the  new statistical algorithms  (MAS  5.0)  and  the 
old empirical algorithms (MAS 4.0) across several different 
conditions  and  species  in  support  of  the  new algorithms. 
Based on  the  results  of the comparison  study,  it seems to 
be  safe  enough  to  apply  the  new  algorithms to  ongoing 
studies.  Databases that have not been archived cannot be 
read under MAS 5.0. However one can use the MAS 5.0 to 
re-read the CHP file and recreate the database. 

We have experienced,  however, that the  array-by-array 
type comparison study, which was done by the Affymetrix®, 
tends to show higher correlation  than  probe-by-probe type 
comparison, which may be much more meaningful in that it 
is  used  for  the  functional  analysis  of  genes  and  gene 
groups  and  their transcriptional  regulations  demonstrated 
by  higher-order data analyses  including clustering,  pattern 
analyses,  and  data  mining.  In  this  study,  we  analyzed the 
expression  values  produced  by the  two  different  sets  of 
algorithms  (i.e.,  MAS  4.0  and  5.0)  from  the  same 
microarray  data  sets  independently experimented  in  our 
laboratory.  Thus,  this  is,  to  our best  knowledge,  the  first 
formal  evaluation study applied to the two different sets of 
algorithms,  MAS  4.0  and  5.0,  applied  to  the  same  data 
sets. We describe possible pitfalls in mixing the old and the 
new algorithms  as  well  as  detailed  characterization  of the 
results. 

Methods 
Gene expression data 
Two  mouse  models  of  cardiomyopathies  were  tested  by 
Affymetrix  MGU74A  GeneChip®  that  contains  12,654 
probe  elements  as  a  part  of  cardiogenomics  PGA 
(Programs for Genomics Application supported by NHBLI). 
It was  discovered  that  25%  of the  probes  on  the  MGU74 
array set were incorrectly oriented and therefore unusable. 
A mask file that could be interpreted by MAS to leave blank 
fields for incorrect probe sets was generated and this mask 
file  has  been  applied  to  all  our text files  that  have  been 
generated by these arrays. 

Banding: Pressure-overload induced 
cardiac hypertrophy 

We  have  used  the  most  commonly  used  surgical 
intervention  for  pressure-overload  induced  hypertrophy, 
coarction  of  the  transverse  aorta  (Rockman  et a/.,  1991 ). 
The system has been well characterized and proven to be 
highly reproducible with a low mortality rate of 10% or less. 

Aortic  banding  is  an  excellent  model  system  to  evaluate 
the  process  of development of  left ventricular hypertrophy 
in response to hemodynamic stress. 

FVB  wild-type  mice  were  obtained  from  Charles  River 
laboratories and operated at 12 weeks of age following the 
experimental  procedure  (Rockman  et a/.,  1991 ).  Banded 
animals and  sham-operated  (i.e.,  chest opened surgically, 
but  no  banding  of the  aorta)  controls  were  dissected  1 
hour,  4 hours,  24 hours,  and 48 hours after the procedure 
to  analyze  immediate  early  and  early  responses.  In 
addition,  the  hypertrophic  response  was  examined  at one 
week  and  eight  weeks  after the  intervention  during  the 
chronic  phase.  All  time  points  have  triplicate  experiments 
such that we ran 36 MGU74A chips in total  (3 (replicates)* 
6 (time points)* 2 (conditions)). 

FVB: FVB benchmark dataset for cardiac 
development, maturation, and aging 
We  created  benchmark  sets  of  expression  profiles  at 
different developmental  stages  to  monitor  changes  in 
cardiac gene expression over time.  Most of our transgenic 
and experimental models of cardiac hypertrophy and heart 
failure are generated in an FVB strain genetic background. 
We have collected the ventricular portion of the heart at the 
following  stages:  Embryonic  day  12.5,  Neonatal  day  1,  1 
week of age, 4 weeks of age, 3-5 months of age,  1 year of 
age.  For the embryonic stage, three hearts were pooled for 
each experiment.  Two hearts were pooled at the neonatal 
stage.  Adult  hearts  were  analyzed  individually.  For  adult 
mice at 3-5 months and one year of age, we have collected 
hearts  separately for female  and  male  mice.  We  did  not 
discriminate  between  sex pre-puberty.  All  timepoints  have 
triplicate experiments such  that we  ran  18 MGU74A chips 
in total (3 (replicates)* 6 (time points)). 

Results 
Correlation between MAS 4.0 and 5.0 by cell 
lines and by probes 
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for genes, 
arrays,  and  across  all  361,548  matched  pairs  of 
measurements.  Table  1 shows  the  correlation  between 
MAS  4.0  and  MAS  5.0  reads  for  both  banding  and  FVB 
experiments.  The  correlation  coefficients  (means  and 
standard  deviations)  for  the  overall  and  array-by-array 
comparisons  were  very  high  (i.e.,  > 0.9),  corresponding 
well  to  the  previous  report.  The correlation  coefficients for 
the genes, however, showed remarkably lower values (i.e., 
< 0.6) than those for the arrays or overall experiments. 

Fig.  1 shows  the  density distributions of the  correlation 
coefficients for genes (Fig.  1 (a) and (d)) and arrays (Fig.  1 
(b),  (c),  (e),  and  (f)),  demonstrating  very  different

distributions  between  MAS  4.0  and  5.0  reads  (i.e.,  Fig.  1 
(a)  vs.  (b)  and  (d)  vs.  (e),  p<1 o-6
).  Correlation  coefficient 
between MAS 4.0 and 5.0 reads for both banding and FVB 
experiments  exhibited  similar  left-skewed  density 
distributions.  The  x-axis  ranges  of  Fig.  1 (b)  and  (e)  were 
scaled from  (c)  and  (e),  respectively,  to  match those of (a) 
and (d),  respectively, to help visual analysis. 

The  remarkable  difference  between  the  array-by-array 
correlation  and  the  probe-by-probe correlation  of  MAS 4.0 
and  5.0  can  be  very  problematic.  It  is  strongly  suggested 
that  even  when  the  array-by-array  correlation  between 
MAS 4.0 and 5.0  is  very high,  it  is  not safe to  believe that 
the correlation between matched probes may also be high. 
Moreover,  the  middle-range  correlation  coefficients  of 
0.5057  (0.2726)  and  0.4867  (0.2926)  between  MAS  4.0 
and  5.0  for  our  banding  and  FVB  experiments,  respec(cid:173)
tively,  suggest that an expression  pattern of a gene across 
a certain  set of conditions  can  be  read  quite differently by 
MAS 4.0 and by 5.0.  It may again affect gene-gene pattern 
correlations  that  are  massively  used  for  the  mainstream 
microarray data analysis such as clustering and microarray 
data mining.  The  high  level  of correlations between  arrays 
may  not  guarantee the  same  high  level  of  correlations 

between genes or patterns in MAS 4.0 and 5.0. 

Correlation between MAS 4.0 and 5.0 
dependents on expression signal intensity 
Although  there  is  no  such  study  like  this,  to  our  best 
knowledge,  comparing  different algorithms  applied  to  the 
same  oligonucleotide  microarray  data,  several  cross(cid:173)
technology comparison  studies were recently performed to 
evaluate  the  possibility  of  using  data  interchangeably 
across  different  platforms.  Gene  features  such  as  GC(cid:173)
content,  sequence  length,  intra-chip  sequence  similarity, 
and  average  intensity  were  suggested  to  be  possible 
candidates  affecting the degree of correlations of matched 
pairs of genes (Kuo eta/., 2002). 

To  determine gene-related features associated  with  the 
degree of correlation,  we calculated correlation  coefficients 
for  different  conditions.  Fig.  2 shows  scatter  plots  of 
average  signal  intensities  (x-axis)  and  the  correlation 
coefficients  between  MAS 4.0 and  5.0  (y-axis)  of matched 
genes  for  banding  (Fig.  2  (a))  and  FVB  (Fig.  2(b)) 
experiments.  Average  signal  intensity  is  defined  as  the 
mean of all the intensity values (i.e., both AvgDiff values for 
MAS 4.0 and Signal values for MAS 5.0) across conditions. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  correlation  coefficient  between 
MAS 4.0 and  5.0 is suggested to  be a function  of average 
signal intensity. 

Fig.  2 suggests that there may be more than  one linear 
component  in  the  association  structure  between  the 
correlation  coefficient  and  average  signal  intensity.  MAS 
4.0 and  5.0 provide presence call  tags for each  probe.  "A' 
call  means  "Absent"  call,  meaning that the  corresponding

target sequence may not be expressed.  "p"  and  ''M''  calls 
mean  "Present"  and  "Marginal"  calls,  respectively. 
According  to  the  call  tags,  we  stratified  all  the  probes  into 
predominantly  ''A" , "M' , or  "P"  calls. A probe is a predomi(cid:173)
nantly "A''  probe when the majority of the calls for the probe 
across  all  the  experiments  have  "A''  tags,  and  so  on.  The 
banding  experiments  showed  no  predominantly  'M'  call 
and the FVB only one predominantly  'M'  call. As shown in 
Table  2,  there  were  6,355  predominantly  "A''  calls  and 
3,688 predominantly  "P"  calls for the  Banding experiment. 
FVB experiment showed 5,691  predominantly  "A''  calls and 
4,351  predominantly  "P"  calls. 

Table  2 demonstrates  the  correlation  coefficients 
(means  and  standard  deviations)  between  MAS  4.0  and 
5.0  for  the  stratified  subsets  of  both  banding  and  FVB 
experiments.  Although  "A''  call  was  originally designed  to 
represent noisy signal, it shows reasonably high correlation 
in  comparison  to  the  "P"  and  overall  calls.  Moreover the 
slopes of the regression line of the predominantly  "A"  calls 
exceed  those  of  the  predominantly  "p"  calls  for  both 
experiments.  It  is  suggested  that  "A"  calls  in  the 
oligonucleotide  microarray experiments  may  have  more 
information  than  just  noise.  Density  plots  for the  average 
intensities  of predominantly  "A"  and  "p"  calls  in  Banding 
and FVB experiments are shown in Fig. 3. 

Fig.  4 demonstrates  the  relationship  between  average 
signal  intensity and  the  correlation  coefficient  between 
MAS  4.0  and  5.0  for  the  matched  probes  in  the  pre(cid:173)
dominantly  "A"  and  "P"  subgroups.  For the predominantly 

"A"  and  "P"  calls  of the  banding  experiments,  the 
correlation coefficient between average signal intensity and 
the correlation coefficients of MAS 4.0 and 5.0 was 0.3073 
and  0.2108,  respectively.  For the  predominantly  "A"  and 
"P"  calls  of  the  FVB  experiments,  the  correlation 
coefficient  between  average  signal  intensity  and  the 
correlation coefficients of MAS 4.0 and 5.0 was 0.0636 and 
-0.0849,  respectively.  One importance of this finding is that 
although  the  correlation  between  the  old  and  the  new 
algorithms  seems  to  increase  with  signal  intensity,  it  may 
show no or even negative correlations for highly expressed 
genes. 

To  evaluate  to  possible  influence  of  the  different 
algorithms,  MAS  4.0  and  5.0,  on  the  clustering  solutions, 
we  measured  the  concordance  of  clusters  obtained  from 
MAS 4.0 and 5.0 by hierarchical clustering, which is one of 
the  most  prominent  mainstream  analyses  of  microarray 
experiments,  Jaccard  and  Kappa  coefficients  were 
computed  as the  measure of clustering  concordance  (Fig. 
5).  Although the MAS 4.0 and 5.0 results are basically the 
same data sets from the same set of scanned images, the 
concordance  did  not  seem  to  near  perfect.  It  is  also 
demonstrated that although the  clustering  concordance  of 
array-by-array clustering  (Fig.  S(a))  may be  moderately 
good,  the  concordance  of  probe-by-probe  clustering  (Fig. 
5(b))  can  be  poor between  the  two  sets  of  algorithms. 
Analysis  for the  FVB  experiments  showed  similar  results 
(data not shown). 

To evaluate the degree of pattern similarity between the 
two  results  of  MAS  4.0  and  5.0  readings,  we  tried  to 
empirically measure the probability of the pattern pairs of a 
single  gene  to  be  in  the  same  cluster  in  cluster analysis. 
We  combined  both  results  to  create  a double-sized  data 
file  and  obtained  clusters  by  K-means  clustering  with 
increasing number of clusters, one hundred times for each 
step. Then we counted the number of pattern pairs that are 
separated  in  their cluster membership.  A pattern  pair  is  a 
pair of gene expression  patterns of a gene across a set of 
conditions (i.e.,  row-wise gene expression pattern) or of an

Fig.  5.  Concordance  of  clusters  from  hierarchical  clustering. 
Jaccard  and  Kappa  coefficients  were  calculated  for  clusters 
obtained from  hierarchical  clustering  of (a)  arrays and  (b)  probes 
to  measure the concordance of cluster membership between the 
two  different  sets  of  algorithms,  MAS  4.0  and  5.0.  It  is 
demonstrated  that although  the  clustering  concordance  of array(cid:173)
by-array clustering (a) may be moderately good, the concordance 
of  probe-by-probe  clustering  (b)  can  be  poor  between  the  two 
sets of algorithms. 

array  including  whole  set  of  probes  (i.e.,  column-wise 
whole  array  expression  pattern),  one  of  which  is  read  by 
MAS 4.0 and the other by 5.0. 

Fig.  6 shows  the  number of  separated  pattern  pairs  of 
row-wise  clustering  (black)  and  column-wise  clustering 
(blue)  for  banding  (Fig.  6  (a))  and  FVB  (Fig.  6  (a)) 
experiments. The numbers of objects (i.e., genes or arrays) 
were matched to objectively compare the degree of pattern 
similarity  between  the  array  (i.e.,  column-wise)  and  gene 
patterns (i.e.,  row-wise). That is,  we selected 24 arrays (12 
conditions  *  2  (MAS  4.0  and  5.0))  for  banding  and  12 
arrays  (6  conditions  *  2  (MAS  4.0  and  5.0)).  Matched

Fig. 6. Number of separated pattern pairs of the same genes in K(cid:173)
means clustering analyses with  increasing number of clusters for 
(a)  banding  and  (b)  FVB  experiments.  Gene  clustering  (broken 
lines)  tends  to  show  more  separated  pattern  pairs  than  array 
clustering (solid lines). 

numbers  of  genes  were  selected  for  both  experiments. 
Each  simulation  was  done  with  300  times  of  random 
selections.  Fig.  6  demonstrates  that  K-means  clustering 
creates  more  separated  pattern  pairs  in  gene  clustering 
than  in  array  clustering.  This  finding  corresponds  well  to 
our  initial  finding  of  poor  probe-by-probe  correlation  in 
comparison  to  array-by-array  correlation  (Table  1 ).  The 
high  level  of  correlations  between  arrays  may  not 
guarantee  the  same  high  level  of  correlations  between 
genes or patterns in MAS 4.0 and 5.0. 

Discussions 

Array-wise  clustering  has  often  been  used  for  molecular 
classification  of  diseases  or  cell  lines  (DeRisi  et at.,  1996; 
Tamayo et at.,  1999; Bittner eta/., 2000). Gene probe-wise 
clustering can  be  used for the functional analysis of genes 
and  gene  groups  and  their transcriptional  regulations 

92  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1 (2) 87-93, December 2003 

(Heller eta/.,  1997;  lyer eta/., 1999; Tavazoie eta/., 1999). 
There  have  been  series  of efforts  to  share  microarray 
experiment data from different experiments (Brazma eta/., 
2001;  Edgar et a/.,  2002;  Gardiner-Garden  and  Littlejohn, 
2001;  Strausberg eta/., 2001 ).  It is highly likely in  the very 
near future  that  researchers  may  share  enormous 
microarray data set for variety of meta-analyses such  that 
having  reliable  standardized  method  to  interpret the  data 
becomes an important issue. This study suggests that data 
read  by  the  old  and  the  new  algorithms  could  not  be 
directly combined in the context of related series. 

Clearly,  our  study  and  observations  are  limited  to  the 
particular  experiments  and  the  data  set.  Although  our 
evaluation is limited to 54 Affymetrix GeneChip® arrays, our 
study  is  based  on  exactly the  same  data  set.  The 
difference,  in theory,  comes only in the reading algorithms, 
MAS 4.0  and 5.0.  Two  well-established  mouse  models  of 
cardiomyopathies  were  experimented  with  experienced 
researchers.  The  analysis for  the  array-wise  correlation 
corresponds  very  well  to  the  original  Affymetrix®  report 
(Kuo eta/., 2002). Our finding is limited to the unexpectedly 
low correlation in gene probe-wise correlation analysis than 
in  array-wise  analysis  and the  observed  gap  between the 
two types of analyses. 

The  observed  result  revealed  poor correlations,  and  in 
some  instances,  negative  correlations.  The  results 
illustrates  that  even  if both  old  and  new  algorithms  show 
high  correlation  in  the  array-wise  comparison,  it  dose  not 
necessarily guarantee the same high  level of correlation  in 
gene  probe-wise  comparison.  Because  gene  clustering 
with  hierarchical  and  partitional  clustering  algorithms  to 
reveal genomic-scale expression pattern analysis is one of 
the  most  reliably  and  frequently  accepted  analysis 
methodology  (Eisen  et a/.,  1998),  the  probe-wise 
correlation  may be  even  more  important and  the  reported 
high  correlation  in  support  of  the  new  algorithms  may 
mislead  investigators to  mix the  old  and the new analyses 
results  without  carefully  evaluating  the  possible  source  of 
confusion in the following higher order analyses. 

We also tried to quantitatively measure the impact of the 
discrepancies  introduced  by  the  new  algorithms  on  the 
clustering  solutions.  Our  result  demonstrates  that  the 
concordance  of  clustering  results  for  the  two  different 
algorithms  may  not  be  safely  high  and  that  the 
concordance  of clustering  may  be  even  lower  in  the  row(cid:173)
wise  clustering  than  the  column-wise  clustering  (Fig.  5). 
Moreover,  the  similarity distance  between  pattern  pairs  of 
the same gene read  by the two algorithms may be greater 
than  some  of the  nearest  patterns  such  that  the  pattern 
pairs, when mixed into a single data set,  can  be separated 
into  different clusters  (Fig.  6).  The  probability  of  pattern 
pairs  to  be  separated  in  clustering  analysis  was  higher in 

gene clustering than array clustering. 

Without further source of data,  we  are not in  a position 
to  determine  which  of  these  two  versions  is  the  better. 
There  may  be  issues  in  both  algorithms.  Our  research 
suggests that more research on the hybridization dynamics 
and  signal  intensity  measures  in  variety  of  conditions  is 
needed. At some point, researchers may have to agree on 
a standardized  way  of  experimenting,  preprocessing, 
measuring, storing, and analyzing microarray studies.
