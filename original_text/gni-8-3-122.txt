Abstract

Abnormal  hematological  values  are  associated  with  vari-
ous  disorders  including  cancer  and  cardiovascular,  met-
abolic,  infectious,  and  immune  diseases.  We  report  the 
copy  number  variations  (CNVs)  in  clinically  relevant 
hematological  parameters,  including  hemoglobin  level, 
red  and  white  blood  cell  counts,  platelet  counts,  and 
red  blood  cell  (RBC)  volume.  We  describe  CNVs  in  sev-
eral  loci  associated  with  these  hematological  parameters 
in  8,842  samples  from  Korean  population-based  studies. 
The  data  that  we  evaluated  included  four  RBC  parame-
ters,  one  platelet  parameter,  and  one  associated  with 
total  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  count,  exceeding  the  ge-
nome-wide  significance.  We  show  that  CNVs  in  hemato-
logical  parameters  are  associated  with  some  loci,  differ-
ent  from  previously  associated  loci  reported  in  single 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  association  studies.

Introduction

The  hematopoietic  system  has  various  functions  includ-
ing  oxygen  transport,  immunity,  blood  wall  surveillance, 
homeostasis,  and  wound  curing.  Hematological  parame-

ters  include  not  only  the  number  of  white  blood  cells 
(WBC)  and  red  blood  cells  (RBC),  but  also  the  number 
of  platelets.  The  hemoglobin  (Hb),  the  hematocrit  (Hct), 
and  the  mean  corpuscular  hemoglobin  concentration 
(MCHC)  were  also  evaluated.  All  of  these  parameters 
are  heritable,  vary  among  individuals  and  are  used  as 
an  index  for  clinical  treatment  (Ferreira  et al.,  2009). 
Abnormal  values  of  hemoglobin  concentration  are  the 
main  indicator  of  common  genetic  diseases  such  as 
cancer,  infection,  and  immune  disease.
    The  RBCs  are  in  charge  of  blood  transport  to  tissues. 
The  MCHC  value  is  an  index  of  anemia,  and  Hct,  the 
proportion  of  blood  volume  that  is  occupied  by  RBCs, 
is  the  index  that  defines  anemia.  An  increased  number 
of  WBCs  is  reported  to  be  a  risk  factor  for  coronary  ar-
tery  disease  (CAD),  myocardial  infarction  (MI),  and  leu-
kemia  (Soranzo et al.,  2009).  Malfunctions  in  RBC  pro-
duction  such  as  anemia  or  erythrocytosis  are  related  to 
hypertension,  cardiovascular  diseases,  asthma,  and 
atherosclerosis,  the  heritability  is  known  to  be  40~90% 
(Ganesh  et al.,  2009).  Platelets  have  important  roles  in 
the  clotting  system,  and  increased  platelet  count  is  re-
lated  to  cardiovascular  diseases  and  cancer  (Soranzo et 
al.,  2009).  A  recent  genome-wide  association  study 
(GWAS)  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  has 
shown  a  significant  association  among  hematological 
traits  (Ganesh  et  al.,  2009;  Kamatani  et  al.,  2010; 
Soranzo  et al.,  2009).
    The  copy  number  variations  (CNV)  representing  struc-
tural  variants  were  recently  reported  to  be  related  to 
disease  susceptibility  such  as  HIV  infection,  autoimmune 
disease,  asthma,  and  nervous  disease.  However,  the  as-
sociation  of  CNV  to  hematological  traits  has  not  been 
reported. 
    The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  determine  a  genetic 
relationship  between  SNPs  and  CNVs  of  hematological 
traits  in  the  general  Korean  population.  We  carried  out 
GWAS  of  CNV  for  the  chosen  traits  and  identified  sev-
eral  loci  associated  with  these  traits.  The  loci  identified 
in  our  study  are  different  from  than  those  reported  in  a 
previous  GWAS  of  SNP.

part  of 
the  Korean  Genome  Epidemiology  Study 
(KoGES).  The  initial  samples  included  5,018  and  5,020 
respective  participants  aged  40  to  69.  Detailed  in-
formation  was  shown  in  a  previous  study  (Cho  et al., 
2009).  The  characteristics  of  the  hematological  traits  are 
summarized  in  Fig.  1  and  Table  1.

Genotyping  and  quality  control

The  majority  of  genomic  DNA  genotyped  on 
the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  was  iso-
lated  from  peripheral  blood  drawn  from  cohort  partici-
pants.  Samples  were  genotyped  using  500  ng  of  ge-
nomic  DNA  and  the  Bayesian  Robust  Linear  Modeling 
using  the  Mahalanobis  Distance  (BRLMM)  Genotyping 
Algorithm  for  genotype  determination  of  500,568  SNPs. 
Samples  were  excluded  due  to  high  missing  genotype 
call  rate,  high  heterozygosity,  and  gender  inconsisten-
cies.  Also,  any  samples  that  had  been  obtained  from  in-

dividuals  who  had  developed  any  kind  of  cancer  or  high 
pairwise  identity-by-state  (IBS)  were  also  excluded,  leav-
ing  a  total  of  8,842  individuals. 

CNV  calling

We  used  PennCNV  to  perform  CNV  calling  which  simul-
taneously  incorporates  the  log  R  ratio  and  B  allele  fre-
quency  based  on  a  hidden  Markov  model  (HMM) 
framework.  We  adopted  the  detail  state  definition  for 
more  precise  modeling  of  CNV  events  (Colella  et al., 
2007).  The  procedure  for  CNV  calling  is  described  in  a 
previous  report  (Wang  et al.,  2007).

Statistical  analysis

Most  association  analyses  were  conducted  using  PLINK 
(version  2.6)  and  R  programs  (version  2.9).  For  each 
hematological  trait,  we  set  control  where  the  value  was

genes,  AUP1  is  involved  in  binding  ubiquitin-conjugating 
enzymes.  AUP1  also  binds  to  the  cytoplasmic  tail  of  in-
tegrin  alpha  (IIb)  subunits,  which  play  a  crucial  role  in 
the  integrin  alpha  (IIb)  beta  (3)  inside-out  signaling  in 
platelets  and  megakaryocytes  that  leads  to  platelet  ag-
gregation  and  thrombus  formation.  HTRA2  encodes  a 
serine  protease  that  induces  apoptosis.  LOXL3  is  essen-
tial  to  the  biogenesis  of  connective  tissue  having  roles 
in  developmental  regulation,  senescence,  tumor  sup-
pression,  cell  growth  control,  and  chemotaxis  to  each

Discussion

Thousands  of  structural  variants,  consisting  of  5-12%  of 
the  human  genome,  are  not  only  revealing,  but  they  are 
also  expected  in  gene  expression.  CNVs  representing 
structural  variants  are  reported  to  be  related  to  disease 
susceptibility.  The  frequency  of  CNVs  is  different  be-
tween  populations,  and  more  than  60%  of  detected 
CNV  are  known  to  be  located  outside  of  genes  (Conrad 
et al.,  2010).  Most  common  CNV  (MAF＞5%)  is  well 
tagged  on  SNP  arrays,  and  this  suggests  that  a  possi-
ble  contribution  of  common  CNVs  to  disease  analyzing 
the  disease  association  of  CNV-tagging  SNPs  (McCarroll 
et al.,  2008).
    It  is  becoming  increasingly  clear  that  genetic  studies 
of  complex  diseases  and  quantitative  traits  must  pay 
closer  attention  to  the  contributions  of  CNVs.  Recent 
developments  in  genome-wide  analysis  have  helped  to 
identify  various  loci  related  to  quantitative  traits,  and 
complex  diseases,  hemostasis,  thrombosis,  and  car-
diovascular  disease  have  been  studied  broadly  for  their 
relationships  to  these  traits  (Ganesh  et al.,  2009).  In 
contrast  to  the  well-developed  resources  available  for 
SNP  association  studies,  we  are  still  in  the  early  phases 
of 
in  ge-
nome-wide  association  studies.  There  was  no  strong 
genome-wide  association  of  CNVs  in  16,000  cases  of 
eight  common  diseases  and  3,000  shared  controls  in 
WTCCC  consortium  though  common  CNVs  are  well  tag-
ged  by  SNP  (Craddock et al.,  2010).  In  contrast  to  the 
well-developed  resources  available  for  SNP  association 
studies,  we  are  still  in  the  early  phases  of  incorporating 
structural  genetic  variation  in  genome-wide  association 
studies.  There  was  no  strong  genome-wide  association 
of  CNVs  in  16,000  cases  of  eight  common  diseases, 
and  3,000  shared  controls  in  the  WTCCC  consortium 
though  common  CNVs  are  well  tagged  according  to 
SNP  (Ganesh et al.,  2009;  Soranzo et al.,  2009).  The  as-
sociations  of  these  hematological  traits  in  the  Japanese 
were  replicated  in  many  of  the  loci,  in  addition  to  some 
novel  loci.  Most  of  the  known  loci  associated  with  the

karyocytes,  leading  to  platelet  aggregation  and  throm-
bus  formation.  HTRA2  is  related  to  apoptosis,  and 
LOXL3  is  essential  to  the  biogenesis  of  connective  tis-
sue,  although  no  relation  with  a  hematological  trait  was 
reported.
    We  also  found  loci  associated  with  Hb  on  3q22.1 
(p=2.6×10
with  MCHC  on  6p21.2  (p=8.1×10
impacts  the  interaction  between  the  cell  membrane  and 
the  cytoplasm.  No  other  neighbor  genes  have  this 
function.
    Previously  reported  Hct-  and  MCHC-associated  CNV 
loci  were  detected,  but  no  functional  importance  has 
been  assigned  to  any  of  these  loci  (Iafrate et al.,  2004).
In  the  future,  curate-associated  loci  should  be  identified 
using  various  algorithms,  since  CNV  detection  is  algo-
rithm-dependent.  Furthermore,  in  silico  results  should  be 
verified  using  quantitative  PCR  (qPCR)  and  functional 
analysis. 
    To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  ge-
nome-wide  association  study  of  CNV  with  hematological 
traits.  In  conclusion,  our  study  offers  understanding  of 
hematological  disease  susceptibility  as  well  as  personal-
ized  prediction  and  prevention  through  combined  SNP 
and  CNV  GWAS.
