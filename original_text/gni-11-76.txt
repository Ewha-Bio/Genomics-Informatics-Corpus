Over the past decade or so, dramatic developments in our ability to experimentally determine the content and function of 
genomes have taken place. In particular, next-generation sequencing technologies are now inspiring a new understanding of 
bacterial transcriptomes on a global scale. In bacterial cells, whole-transcriptome studies have not received attention, owing 
to  the  general  view  that  bacterial  genomes  are  simple.  However,  several  recent  RNA  sequencing  results  are  revealing 
unexpected levels of complexity in bacterial transcriptomes, indicating that the transcribed regions of genomes are much 
larger and complex than previously anticipated. In particular, these data show a wide array of small RNAs, antisense RNAs, 
and alternative transcripts. Here, we review how current transcriptomics are now revolutionizing our understanding of the 
complexity and regulation of bacterial transcriptomes.

Introduction

An operon, which is an independent unit of biochemical 
function in the bacterial genome, consists of functionally 
related genes under the control of a single promoter [1]. 
Thus, the cluster of genes in an operon is transcribed into a 
single mRNA molecule, referred to as a polycistronic system. 
This foundational concept of bacterial genome organization 
has been leading to the discovery of fundamental regulatory 
mechanisms of bacterial transcription. Bacterial transcrip-
tion is a biological process that is initiated from a promoter 
by  the  RNA  polymerase  (RNAP)  holoenzyme  complex, 
consisting  of  a  single  RNAP  core  unit  and  a  σ-factor 
subunit.  Association  with  different  σ-factor  subunits 
provides promoter specificity to the RNAP core unit. Seven 
species of σ-factor subunits, for example, have been iden-
tified  in  Escherichia  coli,  and  each  participates  in  the 
transcription of a specific set of genes in response to growth 
conditions  [2].  In  addition  to  the  σ-factor  association, 
transcription is either activated or repressed by a wide range 
of transcription factors, such as the Lac repressor of the lac 
operon. It was estimated that E. coli encodes roughly 300 
regulatory DNA-binding proteins, of which 35% are acti-

vators, 43% are repressors, and 22% are dual regulators [3]. 
Bacterial  gene  expression  can  be  regulated  by  other 
regulatory factors, in addition to regulatory DNA-binding 
proteins,  such  as  small  regulatory  RNAs  and  internal 
promoters  within  operons,  which  increase  the  transcrip-
tome complexity [4, 5]. Over the last decade or so, many of 
these  examples  have  been  discovered  by  quantitative 
analysis of bacterial transcriptomes, which are defined as the 
complete  set of  cellular  RNA  transcripts.  Although DNA 
microarrays have provided comprehensive information on 
the transcriptome’s complexity in bacterial cells [6, 7], the 
advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has dramati-
cally accelerated our analytical capacity via high-throughput 
transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) in combination with 
mRNA enrichment methods [8]. This large amount of data 
has  revealed  many  unexpected  features  in  the  bacterial 
transcriptome, including gene structures, multiple promo-
ters, and RNA-based regulation [7, 9, 10]. In some cases, 
small RNAs (sRNAs) account for 10% to 20% of bacterial 
RNA products, which have important regulatory roles [8]. 
These new findings suggest that bacterial transcription is 
much more complicated and subtle than previously thought. 
In this review, we discuss advances in bacterial transcrip-

tomics, based on RNA-seq, and the current understanding of 
the complexity and regulation of bacterial transcriptomes. 

Determination of Bacterial Transcriptomes 

Like  eukaryotes,  bacterial  transcriptome  analyses  have 
been initiated by the development of microarrays [11]. In 
particular, high-density tiling arrays, which consist of hun-
dreds of thousands of DNA oligonucleotide probes repre-
senting both strands of a given genome, have been massively 
used to study bacterial transcriptomes. The major advantage 
of tiling arrays is to interrogate the boundaries of the entire 
set of transcripts in a cell without taking account of genome 
annotation [12]. Consequently, this technical advance dis-
covered  many  new  RNA  molecules,  such  as  regulatory 
sRNAs.  Based  on  this  experimental  approach,  compre-
hensive  transcriptomics  have  recently  been  published  for 
Bacillus  subtilis  [13],  Halobacterium  salinarum  [14],  Myco-
plasma  pneumonia  [6],  Caulobacter  crescentus  [15],  Listeria 
monocytogenes [16], and E. coli [10]. One of these studies, for 
example, focused on the analysis of transcriptionally active 
regions across an entire genome of Listeria monocytogenes, 
revealing the complete Listeria operon map as well as various 
types of RNAs, including at least two of which are involved 
in virulence in mice [16]. Although the high-density tiling 
arrays were able to interrogate the bacterial transcriptomes 
without  genome  annotation,  the  array-based  approach  is 
limited by a high rate of noise due to cross-hybridization, the 
low dynamic range of detection due to signal saturation, and 
the inability to detect low copy number of transcripts [17].  
High-throughput  sequencing  of  RNAs  using  NGS  me-
thods  has  overcome  some  drawbacks  of  the  array-based 
approach. Currently, commercially available NGS systems 
include the Roche 454 system, based on the pyrosequencing; 
the  Illumina  sequencing  system,  based  on  sequencing  by 
synthesis;  the  SOLiD  system,  based  on  sequencing  by 
oligonucleotide ligation and detection; and the Ion torrent 
system, based on the use of a semiconductor-based sequen-
cing technique [18, 19]. Also, third-generation sequencing 
technologies have been actively developed to determine the 
sequence directly from a single DNA molecule without DNA 
library  amplification  [18].  Over  the  conventional  Sanger 
sequencing method, the primary advantage offered by NGS 
methods is the inexpensive production of large volumes of 
sequence data, which can be used to identify and quantify 
rare transcripts without prior knowledge of a particular gene 
[19, 20]. 

Unlike  a  hybridization-based  array  approach,  RNA-seq 
allows unambiguous mapping of transcripts to unique re-
gions  of  the  genome  with  single-base  resolution;  hence, 
there is essentially lower background noise [21]. In addition 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  2,  2013

to the accurate quantification of a transcriptome consisting 
of known genes, RNA-seq allows researchers to determine 
the  correct  gene  annotation,  expressed  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms, novel genes, and RNAs with high levels of 
reproducibility for both technical and biological replicates. 
However, bacterial mRNA can exist as little as 1% to 5% of 
total RNA; so, mRNA enrichment is a challenging step to 
obtain sufficient transcript coverage [8]. Currently, several 
methods  are  being  used  to  remove  the  rRNA  and  tRNA 
fraction from the total RNA pool. Among those methods, 
terminator 5'-phosphate-dependent exonuclease treatment 
has  been  successfully  applied  to  enrich  primary  tran-
scriptome by reducing processed or degraded RNAs with a 
5'-monophosphate end (e.g., rRNAs and tRNAs) [9, 10]. To 
remove  the  rRNA  fraction  from  the  total  RNA  pool, 
Ribo-Zero  rRNA  removal  kits,  using  biotinylated  probes 
that selectively bind rRNA, have been used successfully for a 
wide  range  of  organisms,  from  bacteria  to  human  (Epi-
centre). 

The  requirements  of  the  ideal  RNA-seq  method  are 
strand-specificity and quantitation across a wide dynamic 
range [22, 23]. However, a common strategy of an RNA-seq 
library  preparation  is  to  convert  single-stranded  RNA 
molecules into double-stranded cDNA fragments of certain 
sizes, flanked by platform-specific adapter sequences. This 
means  that  double-strand  cDNA  is  synthesized  from 
randomly  primed  hexamers,  which  cannot  provide  infor-
mation on the transcribed strands. A major shortcoming of 
conventional RNA-seq methods is therefore the lack of RNA 
polarity information. The polarity of RNA transcripts is very 
useful  in  facilitating  subsequent  computational  analyses, 
including the correction of novel gene annotations and the 
detection  of  overlapping  genetic  features  encoded  in 
opposite orientations. In particular, polarity information is 
important  for  understanding  small  bacterial  genomes,  in 
which genes are densely coded, with overlapping untran-
slated regions (UTRs) or open reading frames (ORFs) [23]. 
However, the recently developed strand-specific RNA-seq 
analysis enhances the value of bacterial transcriptomics. In 
terms of how to mark the transcribed strand, several me-
thods can be categorized largely into two approaches. One is 
marking a strand by orientation-dependent adaptor ligation 
to the 5' and 3' ends of the RNA transcript, such as RNA 
ligation  [24],  SMART  [25],  NNSR  priming  [26],  and 
SMART-RNA ligation [23]. The other is marking one strand 
by  chemical  modification,  either  on  the  RNA  itself  by 
bisulfite treatment [27] or on the second strand cDNA by 
dUTP  incorporation  [28].  Among  several  strand-specific 
RNA-seq methods, the dUTP method was identified as the 
leading protocol because of its wide range of coverage and 
availability of paired-end sequencing (Fig. 1A) [23]. Briefly, 

www.genominfo.org

77

S  Cho,  et  al.  Unraveling  the  Complexity  of  the  Bacterial  Transcriptome 

the dUTP method starts with converting the initial mRNA 
into cDNA. This first cDNA strand is used as a template for 
second cDNA strand synthesis, which incorporates dUTP 
instead of dTTP. After marking both ends of the cDNA by 
ligation  of  adaptor  sequences,  the  second  strand  is  sub-
sequently  degraded  by  uracil-N-glycosylase  treatment, 
which  selectively  removes  the  uracil  site  on  the  DNA. 
Finally, the remaining first-strand cDNA, with directional 
adaptor  sequences,  can  be  sequenced  on  the  Illumina 
Platform using both single-read and paired-end sequencing 

[28]. 

With these technological breakthroughs, several bacterial 
RNA-seq studies showed that bacterial transcription is not 
as simple as previously thought [10, 29-32]. For example, in 
the transcriptomic analyses of Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli, 
Vibrio cholera, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, it was 
revealed  that  noncoding  RNAs  play  an  important  role  in 
diverse  regulatory  mechanisms  [29-32].  In  addition,  the 
complexity  of  the  E.  coli  transcription  unit  indicates  that 
bacterial transcription is regulated by the differential use of

[10]. 

Primary Transcriptome Analysis 

In bacteria, cellular RNA comprises primary transcripts 
that  are  marked  by  a  5'-triphosphate  (5'PPP)  group  and 
processed or degraded RNAs that carry either a 5'-mono-
phosphate  (5'P)  or  5'-hydroxyl  group  (5'OH)  [7,  9].  In 
particular, primary transcriptome analysis is beneficial for 
improving  the  annotation  of  any  sequenced  bacterial  ge-
nome. Due to the absence of a poly(A) tail at the 3'-end and 
the instability of mRNAs with very short half-lives, however, 
bacterial primary transcriptome analysis has been challen-
ging  [8].  Also,  cellular  RNA  was  considered  to  consist 
mainly of rRNA and tRNA in prokaryotic cells; therefore, 
mRNA  enrichment  is  essential  to  determine  the  primary 
transcriptome from RNA-seq. Differential RNA-seq (dRNA- 
seq) enriches RNA samples for primary transcripts by use of 
a  5'P-dependent  terminator  exonuclease  (TEX)  that  spe-
cifically  degrades  RNAs  carrying  a  5'P,  leading  to  relative 
enrichment  of  primary  transcripts  and  depletion  of  pro-
cessed  RNAs.  Then,  the  5'-end  positions  of  the  primary 
transcripts  can  be  identified  by  comparison  of  cDNA 
libraries generated with and without TEX treatment (Fig. 
1B)  [9,  31,  33-36].  The  5'-end  of  RNA  transcripts,  cor-
responding to the TSS, is mostly related with the regulation 
of transcribed genes, including promoters, ribosome binding 
sites,  transcription  factor  binding  sites,  antisense  RNAs 
(asRNAs),  and  other 
regulatory  noncoding  RNAs 
(ncRNAs).

Transcription Start Site

Bacterial TSSs have been identified mainly through primer 
extension  and S1 nuclease  protection mapping assay,  but 
these  methods  are  labor-intensive  (Fig.  2A)  [37].  High- 
density tiling arrays have also been used for large-scale TSS 
mapping  in  E.  coli  and  Caulobacter  crescentus,  with  limited 
mapping  resolution  [15,  38].  In  addition,  indirect  TSS 
identification in the E. coli transcriptome has been made by 
RNAP  chromatin  immunoprecipitation,  coupled  with 
microarray (ChIP-chip) [39]. More recently, dRNA-seq has 
been  developed  to  map  TSSs  in  Helicobacter  pylori  [9].  It 
revealed 1907 TSSs, which were found in upstream regions 
of annotated mRNAs within annotated genes on the same 
DNA strand or on the opposite DNA strand and in regions 
without any annotated genes in proximity. In addition to the 
337 primary operons defined by the TSSs, it obtained 126 
additional suboperons and 66 monocistrons overlapping the

3' part of polycistrons in H. pylori. Alternative TSSs for the 
determination of suboperons (or transcription units) have 
been determined through the integration of massive-scale 
sequencing  and  5'-rapid  amplification  of  cDNA  ends  (5'- 
RACE) method in E. coli (Fig. 2B) [10]. The consecutive 
iterations of experiments identified a total of 4,133 TSSs. 
Interestingly,  it  was  found  that  ~35%  of  promoters  con-
tained multiple TSSs, defining alternative transcription units 
in the E. coli genome. For example, the transcription factor 
Lrp  activates  stpA,  encoding  an  H-NS-like  DNA-binding 
protein from a dominant TSS position (2,796,558). How-
ever, two other TSSs are used less in the exponential growth 
phase. These results show that the bacterial transcriptome is 
actively regulated by means of alternative TSSs in response 
to differential environmental conditions. dRNA-seq method 
has been applied to detect genomewide TSS maps in other 
bacterial  species.  Interestingly,  the  cyanobacterium  Syne-
chocystis contains 3,537 TSSs, 64% of which were assigned to 
asRNAs  or  ncRNAs  [40].  In  conclusion,  the  dRNA-seq 
approach is a strong tool for annotation of operon structures, 
transcription units (or suboperons), and detection of TSSs, 
providing  important  insights  into  the  understanding  of  a 
comprehensive transcription regulatory network.

Regulatory sRNAs 

In  bacteria,  regulatory  ncRNAs  have  emerged  as  key 
players, acting by various mechanisms to modulate meta-
bolic,  physiological,  and  pathogenic  processes,  as  well  as 
bacterial  adaptive  immunity  [41].  The  largest  group  of 

www.genominfo.org

79

S  Cho,  et  al.  Unraveling  the  Complexity  of  the  Bacterial  Transcriptome 

regulatory  ncRNAs  consists  of  regulatory  sRNAs,  which 
affect the transcription, translation, and stability of target 
mRNAs  through  base  pairing  with  the  targets  (Fig.  2C). 
These  sRNAs  can  work  in  cis  by  overlapping  their  target 
genes  encoded  on  the  opposite  DNA  strand  of  the  same 
genomic locus or in trans by targeting genes located else-
where on the chromosome [41, 42]. Therefore, the discovery 
and characterization of bacterial sRNAs are critical for the 
understanding of the complexity of bacterial transcriptomes. 
Primary  transcriptome  analysis  allows  one  to  detect  the 
presence of sRNAs at their abundance in a genome-scale by 
measuring  nonprotein-coding  RNA  transcripts.  For  in-
stance, an unexpected 60 sRNAs have been discovered in the 
primary transcriptome analysis of H. pylori, indicating that 
the  complexity  of  gene  expression  in  the  small  H.  pylori 
genome is increased by genomewide antisense transcription 
[9]. In this way, many sRNAs were recently discovered from 
various bacterial species, including the opportunistic patho-
gen Burkholderia cenocepacia (13 sRNAs), Salmonella Typhi Ty2 
(55 sRNAs), and L. monocytogenes (50 sRNAs). The sRNAs 
from B. cenocepacia and L. monocytogenes were induced during 
niche switching and involved in virulence, respectively [16, 
43, 44]. Furthermore, comparing of the sRNAs with global 
gene expression could be facilitated in the analysis of a set of 
genes that are mainly involved in the pathogenic features of 
B. cenocepacia. In addition, immunoprecipitation of specific 
RNA-binding  proteins  can  lead  to  selectively  enriched 
sRNAs [8]. The first attempt at sRNA analysis, based on the 
NGS technique (RIP-seq), was carried out in Salmonella [29]. 
Using  the  RNA-binding  property  of  Hfq  proteins,  Hfq- 
associated  RNAs  could  be  enriched  and  analyzed  by 
immunoprecipitation of Hfq-RNA complexes, followed by 
deep sequencing. Through this study, more than twice as 
many new sRNAs were discovered over previously known 
sRNAs [29]. These results indicate that sRNAs are abundant 
in the bacterial transcriptome, representing its regulatory 
complexity. 

Antisense RNA 

RNA-seq technology has uncovered that 5% to 25% of all 
protein-coding genes encoded on the sense strand interact 
with the asRNAs that are transcribed from the antisense 
strand, thereby regulating their transcription, translation, or 
degradation  (Fig.  2C)  [8].  These  transcripts  are  named 
asRNAs, which overlapped partially with the 5'-UTR or 3'- 
UTR of their target protein-coding genes [16]. The abun-
dance  of  these  transcripts  has  been  revealed  in  several 
bacterial genomes, including Sallmonella Typhimurium [29], 
B. Subtilis [13], E. coli [45], Staphylococcus aureus [46], and M. 
pneumonia [6]. Using RNaseIII, which specifically degrades 

double-stranded  short  RNAs,  for  example,  stable  sRNA 
molecules  that  map  symmetrically  to  both  strands  were 
enriched from Staphylococcus aureus. RNA-seq of the enriched 
RNA  molecules  resulted  in  the  detection  of  1387  ORFs, 
which  covers  50%  of  the  antisense  strand  [46].  Another 
study  identified  ~1,000  novel  asRNAs  in  E.  coli  using 
high-throughput sequencing [45]. Briefly, the unique 5' end 
of  the  primary  transcriptome  was  analyzed  by  treatment 
with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to convert 5'PPP groups 
into 5'P, followed by ligation of an RNA oligonucleotide and 
reverse-transcription with a random primer. Further studies 
of several asRNAs suggested that they are involved in a wide 
range  of  cellular  mechanisms,  such  as  the  translational 
regulation of the quorum-sensing gene rpaR in Rhodopseu-
domonas  palustris  [47].  Based  on  the  abundance  of  tran-
scripts, it has been suggested that the number of asRNAs 
correlates negatively with genome size [7]. Large asRNAs 
could be the consequence of genome reduction with tran-
scriptional  regulation,  mediated  at  the  RNA  level.  Taken 
together,  RNA-seq  approaches  are  revolutionizing  our 
understanding of the abundance of asRNAs in bacteria [42]. 

Future Perspectives 

With emerging advances in NGS, RNA-seq has uncovered 
the  complexity  of  the  bacterial  transcriptome.  Although 
transcriptional regulation by asRNAs, novel ncRNAs, and 
alternative splicing events have been well known in euka-
ryotes, similar regulatory events in prokaryotes have been 
newly  elucidated  in  recent  studies.  In  accordance  with 
technological  developments,  several  approaches  for  com-
putational pipeline and bioinformatics analysis have been 
also progressed. Here, we review sequencing methods, their 
advantages,  and  several  key  results  for  bacterial  tran-
scriptome  analysis.  Undoubtedly,  RNA-seq  is  having  a 
breathtaking  impact  on  our  understanding  of  biological 
systems  and  will  provide  entirely  new  insights  into  the 
biological parts in living genomes. Furthermore, the concept 
of artificial genetic circuits has been advanced in synthetic 
biology, due to their simplicity in manipulating the cell [48]. 
For example, promoters, sRNAs, ncRNAs, and ribosome- 
binding  sites  are  considered  as  biological  parts  in  a  cell, 
which can be used to assemble new genetic circuits, such as 
switches or oscillators. A wide range of biological parts can 
be screened and listed up from transcriptome analysis by 
NGS.  Nevertheless,  many  efforts  to  develop  diverse  ex-
perimental approaches using NGS methods will reveal the 
unexpected complexity of bacterial transcriptomes.
