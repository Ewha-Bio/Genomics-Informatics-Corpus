Abstract

In  Sasang  constitutional  medicine,  both  disease  sus-
ceptibility  and  drug  response  are  considered  to  be  re-
lated  to  the  characteristics  of  an  individual’s  physiology 
and  psychology:  a  theory  which  is  central  to  traditional 
Korean  medicine.  Based  on  such  observable  character-
istics,  Sasang  constitutional  medicine  classifies  people 
into  four  constitutional  types.  Genetic  studies  of  Sasang 
constitution  would  help  reveal  the  inheritance  patterns 
and  models  of  the  typological  traits  and,  moreover,  help 
with  traditional  medical  diagnosis  and  treatment.  To  in-
vestigate  the  heritable  aspect  of  Sasang  constitution,  we 
collected  various  pedigrees  from  South  Korea.  The 
study  population  has  101  pedigrees  composed  of  593 
individuals.  The  determination  of  the  Sasang  constitution 
type  of  each  individual  was  performed  by  doctors  who 
diagnose  the  Sasang  constitutional  type  of  individuals 
as  part  of  their  professional  practice.  We  calculated  es-
timates 
heritability. 
Parent-Offspring  pairs  showed  the  strongest  familial  cor-
relation  of  Sasang  constitutional  type,  with  the  correla-
tion  values  of  0.21  and  0.28,  followed  by  sibling  pairs

with  the  value  ranging  between  0.14  and  0.25.  From  the 
heritability  analysis  conducted  with  the  Variance-Com-
ponent  method,  the  heritability  of  TE  (Tae-Eum)  type,  SY 
(So-Yang)  type,  and  SE  (So-Eum)  type  were  55%,  41%, 
and  47%,  respectively.  This  pattern  of  heritability  was 
consistent  with  different  set  of  analyses,  which  suggest 
the  robustness  of  our  result.  Our  result  clearly  shows 
that  the  Sasang  constitution  type  is  heritable,  and  fur-
ther  genetic  analysis  based  on  our  result  will  shed  light 
on  the  biological  mechanism  of  Sasang  constitution.

Introduction

For  more  than  several  hundred  years  there  have  existed 
theories,  diagnostic  practices,  and  constitutional  rem-
edies  in  the  field  of  Sasang  constitutional  medicine. 
Sasang  constitutional  medicine  classifies  individuals  into 
four  different  constitutional  types:  TY  (Tae-Yang)  type, 
TE  (Tae-Eum)  type,  SY  (So-Yang)  type  and  SE  (So-Eum) 
type.  One  important  theory  in  this  field  of  traditional 
Korean  medicine  is  that  both  drug  response  and  the 
disease  susceptibility  are  related  to  a  given  person’s 
particular  psychological  and  physiological  characteri-
stics.  Based  on  such  characteristics,  Sasang  constitu-
tional  medicine  classifies  people  into  four  constitutional 
types.  In  the  Sasang  constitution  type  system,  one  is 
treated  differently  in  medical  procedures  based  on 
one’s  type.  It  is  widely  accepted  in  Korea  that  in-
dividualized  medicine  based  on  constitutional  energy 
traits  has  a  favorable  influence  on  treatment  (Leem  and 
Park,  2007)  and  constitution-specific  responses  to  herbs 
are  well  described  (Jeong  and  Song,  1995a;  Jeong  and 
Song,  1995b).  Furthermore  inconsistent  drug  responses 
and  disease  susceptibility  can  be  explained  to  some  ex-
tent  by  characterizing  the  Sasang  constitution  and  tak-
ing  advantage  of  it  in  the  course  of  treatment. 
    Studies  seeking  genetic  evidence  for  the  Sasang  con-
stitution  have  been  rare,  except  only  a  few  reports 
showing  an  association  between  Sasang  constitution 
type  and  specific  genetic  polymorphisms  (Song  et al., 
2008;  Um et al.,  2003).  To  unravel  the  genetic  patterns 
of  the  Sasang  constitution  obtaining  genetic  evidence 
will  be  mandatory.

Statistical  analysis

Each  Sasang  type  can  be  considered  as  an 
in-
dependent  factor  underlying  several  different  characteri-
stics.  Hence  we  investigated  each  of  the  constitution 
types  separately,  grouping  them  as  SY  type  and  others, 
TY  type  and  others,  and  so  on.
    For  basic  descriptive  statistics  of  the  Sasang  con-
stitution,  we  implemented  the  software  SAS  version  9.1. 
Evidence  for  inheritance  of  Sasang  constitution  was  as-
sessed  with  the  statistical  genetics  package  Familial 
CORrelation  (FCOR)  and  ASSOC  (Keen  and  Elston, 
2003)  in  Statiatical  Analysis  of  Genetic  Epidemiology 
(S.A.G.E)  version  5.4.2  to  obtain  the  familial  correlation 
coefficient  values  and  heritability  estimates. 

Results

Evidence  of  heritable  aspects  of  the  Sasang  phenotype 
was  investigated  based  on  collected  pedigrees.  Here  we 
determined  that  there  were  101  pedigrees  in  the  study 
population  with  average  of  5.9  members  per  family,  as 
shown  in  Table  1.  The  smallest  family  had  three  mem-

ques  have  enabled  the  assessment  of  heritability,  the 
proportion  of  total  phenotypic  variance  due  to  additive 
genetic  effects,  and  the  genetic  correlation  between 
traits  in  extended  families  in  the  presence  of  environ-
mental  covariates.  This  approach  has  been  employed  to 
assess  the  genetic  contributions  to  variation  in  traits.

Methods

Study  population

The  subjects  were  recruited  to  investigate  candidate  loci 
for  Sasang  constitution  among  the  Korean  population. 
They  were  recruited  from  3  local  clinics  and  10  hospitals 
from  November  1,  2006  to  July  31,  2008.  Study  ex-
cluded  individuals  with  physically  or  psychologically  se-
rious  disease  or  women  in  pregnancy.  Among  the  re-
maining  individuals  aged  between  10  and  80,  the 
Sasang  constitution  type  was  diagnosed  by  doctors. 
The  study  population  has  101  pedigrees  composed  of 
593  individuals.
    Pedigree  relationship  information  was  determined  by 
interviewers.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  every 
enrolled  subject,  and  each  study  protocol  was  approved 
by  the  institutional  review  board  (IRB)  of  the  Korean 
Institute  of  Medicine  (approval  number,  I-2008/010-001).

Determination  of  Sasang  Constitution  Type

The  method  of  determination  of  the  Sasang  constitution 
type  depended  on  whether  the  subject  had  pharmaco-
logical  records  or  not,  which  were  clinically  supple-
mented  as  needed  to  correct  the  identification  of 
Sasang  constitution  (Lee,  2008).  If  the  study  participants 
did  have  any  pharmacological  records,  previous  diag-
nosis  were  used  to  determine  their  Sasang  constitution. 
Otherwise,  three  doctors  independently  examined  the 
study  participants  carefully  in  terms  of  physical  body 
shape,  appearance, 
temperament  and  pathological 
symptoms,  and  then  determined  the  Sasang  constitution 
type.  37  subjects  whose  Sasang  constitution  was  incon-
sistent  among  the  three  doctors  were  excluded  from  fur-
ther  analysis.

ond  largest  pedigree.  This  figure  was  originally  made  by 
CraneFoot3.2.1  and  modified  for  this  manuscript  using 
Microsoft  Powerpoint.  The  square  and  the  circle  represent 
male  and  female,  respectively.  The  horizontal  line  means

rents-offspring  relationship.  The  squares  or  circles  linked  by 
curved  line  indicate  the  same  individual.

bers  and  the  largest  family  contained  128.  Such  large 
families,  e.g.  having  more  than  one  hundred  family 
members,  can  contribute  to  estimate  the  heritability  and 
familial  correlations  more  precisely.  Forty-six  percent  of 
the  total  individuals  were  male.  Out  of  593  individuals, 
268  founders  and  325  non-founders  were  included.  The 
number  of  total  parent-offspring  pairs  were  650.  The 
sibling  pairs  were  256,  including  93,  111  and  52  for  sis-
ter-sister,  sister-brother  and  brother-brother  pairs, 
respectively.  Moreover,  the  pairs  of  grandparent-off-
spring,  avuncular,  cousin,  and  half-sib  were  found  to  be 
258,  496,  562  and  2. 
    In  Fig.  1,  one  can  observe  the  pedigree  structures  of 
these  large  family  data.  Those  are  two  main  stereotypes 
of  large  family  structure:  one  is  vertically  large,  with 
multiple  generations,  and  the  other  is  horizontally  large, 
linked  to  other  families  by  marriage,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1a 
and  Fig.  1b,  respectively.
    In  total  the  diagnosed  individuals  were  497,  with  207 
males  and  290  females.  The  distribution  of  the  Sasang 
constitution  types  in  the  present  study  population  is  de-
scribed  in  Table  2.  More  than  70%  of  the  total  pop-
ulation  was  categorized  as  TE  type  and  SY  type.  The 
most  frequent  Sasang  constitution  was  TE  type  (43%, 
202  individuals  out  of  497).  The  second  largest  was  SY 
type  with  31%,  and  the  third  was  25%  for  SE  type.  TY 
type  was  present  in  only  a  few  cases:  0.83%.  In  the  TY 
type  group,  there  was  one  male  and  three  females. 
Comparing  Sasang  constitution  by  sex,  more  than  50% 
of  the  males  were  TE  type,  while  the  TE  type  and  SY 
type  categories  were  approximately  35%  each 
in 
females.  We  found  that  the  major  Sasang  constitution 
types  in  males  were  different  from  those  in  females. 
This  suggests  that  sex  should  be  taken  into  account 
when  conducting  any  further  genetic  analyses  on  this 
data  on  the  Sasang  constitution.  The  distribution  of  the 
Sasang  constitution  types  is  shown  in  Table  2. 
    The  identified  familial  correlation  coefficients  for  each 
relationship  pairs  are  shown  in  Table  3.  A  familial  corre-
lation  values  of  spouse  pairs  indicates  the  effect  of  a 
shared  environment  on  the  phenotype,  but  here  it  is  al-
most  0;  this  means  the  Sasang  Constitution  is  hardly  re-
lated  to  the  environmental  factors  encountered  in  daily

life.  For  parent-offspring  pairs,  the  coefficient  was  0.20
∼0.28.  Sibling  pairs  displayed  high  correlations,  ranging 
between  0.14  and  0.25.  The  parent-offspring  relation-
ships  exhibited  higher  correlations  than  sibling  pairs  or 
other  relationship  pairs,  such  as  grandparent-offspring, 
half-sib  or  cousin.
    Heritability  estimates  under  several  conditions  are 
shown  in  Table  4.  Four  Sasang  types  were  used  in  the 
analysis.  Among  the  four  constitutional  types,  it  is  possi-
ble  to  have  a  trait  with  an  Eum  type  versus  a  Yang 
type.  Estimated  heritability  of  Eum/Yang  was  43%. 
Moreover  we  made  several  groups  such  that  the  person 
could  be  clasified  as  SE  type  or  other  types,  SY  type 
or  other  types,  and  TE  type  or  other  types  and  then  we 
calculated  the  degree  of  heritability  of  the  SE  type,  SY 
type  and  TE  type  Sasang  constitutions.  Having  no  co-
variate  in  the  analysis,  the  ratios  are  48%,  41%  and 
55%  for  the  heritability  of  SE  type,  SY  type,  and  TE 
type,  respectively. 

Discussion

Whereas  diseases  have  been  the  focus  in  western  medi-
cine,  the  focus  of  oriental  medicine  has  been  on  the  hu-
man  being  itself  rather  than  the  disease  (Bhushan et al., 
2005;  Cho et al.,  2007).  Every  individual  is  of  a  different 
type  and  should  be  treated  accordingly:  this  matches 
closely  with  the  key  ideas  of  preventive  and  holistic

    This  study  suggests  that  there  are  genetic  compo-
nents  underlying  the  Sasang  constitution  types.  We  ana-
lyzed  the  traits  of  the  Eum  type  versus  the  Yang  type, 
and  found  the  heritability  of  43%.  The  heritability  esti-
mates  were  41%,  48%,  and  55%  for  the  SY  type,  SE 
type,  and  TE  types,  respectively.  One  twin  study  pre-
sented  in  2007  (Lee et al.,  2007)  reported  similar  results: 
43%,  47%,  and  48%  for  SY  type,  SE  type,  and  TE 
type,  respectively.  The  strength  of  the  pattern  of  herit-
ability  is  consistent  between  studies. 
    Familial  correlation  and  heritability  analysis  of  the 
Sasang  constitution  types  in  this  study  will  help  to  eluci-
date  the  inheritance  pattern  and  to  explain  the  differ-
ences  in  the  percentage  of  the  four  Sasang  constitution 
types.  A  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  genetic 
mechanism  of  the  Sasang  constitution  will  require  addi-
tional  genetic  approaches. 
    Moreover  children,  generally  whose  diagnosis  of 
Sasang  constitution  type  identification  is  generally  hard-
er  than  adults,  can  be  diagnosed  and  treated  using  the 
information  of  their  parents.  As  the  Sasang  constitu-
tional  type  reflects  inborn  characteristics,  knowledge 
about  a  given  person’s  constitution  can  help  guide  the 
proper  treatment  of  specific  symptoms  as  well  as  pre-
vention  of  disease.  For  example,  people  of  the  SE  types 
tend  to  have  vulnerable  digestive  organs  (Baek  et al., 
2004),  so  they  should  choose  and  eat  food  with  partic-
ular  care.  The  TE  type  tends  to  have  weak  respiratory 
organs  (Lee,  2005),  so  they  need  to  take  steps  to  make 
sure  they  reside  in  a  clean-air  environment.  In  short, 
knowledge  of  the  Sasang  constitution  could  lead  people 
to  come  to  know  their  specific  health  status  and  ten-
dencies,  which  should  lead  to  the  adoption  of  an  envi-
ronment  and  lifestyle  most  suitable  for  their  own  con-
stitutional  types  from  childhood.  Therefore,  clarification 
of  the  pattern  of  the  Sasang  constitution  genetic  in-
heritance  in  the  future  would  be  expected  to  contribute 
to  the  advance  of  personalized-medicine. 
    A  limitation  of  this  study  is  that  the  percentage  of  TY 
type  constitution  was  low  with  only  0.08%  included, 
markedly  lower  than  the  other  Sasang  types.  However 
previous  studies  have  reported  the  prevalence  of  the  TY 
type  between  0.03%  and  0.1%  (Chae  et al.,  2003). 
Studies  based  on  populations  large  enough  to  include 
enough  TY  type  individuals  to  gather  data  on  this  type 
will  be  necessary  in  the  future.
