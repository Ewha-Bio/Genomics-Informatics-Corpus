Abstract 
Radiofrequency (RF) radiation at the frequency of mobile 
phones has been not reported to induce cellular responses 
in  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  models.  We  exposed  HEI-OC1, 
conditionally-immortalized  mouse  auditory cells,  to  RF 
radiation to characterize cellular responses to 1763 MHz 
RF radiation.  While we could not detect any differences 
upon  RF  exposure,  whole-genome expression profiling 
might  provide  the  most  sensitive  method  to  find  the 
molecular responses to RF radiation. HEI-OC1  cells were 
exposed to 1763 MHz RF radiation at an average specific 
absorption rate (SAR) of 20 W/kg for 24 hr and harvested 
after 5 hr of recovery (R5), alongside sham-exposed samples 
(S5). From the whole-genome profiles of mouse neurons, 
we selected 9 differentially-expressed genes between the 
S5 and R5 groups using information gain-based recursive 
feature elimination procedure.  Based on  support vector 
machine (SVM), we designed a prediction model using the 
9 genes to discriminate the two groups.  Our prediction 
model could predict the target dass without any error. From 
these  results,  we  developed  a prediction  model  using 
biomarkers  to  determine  the  RF  radiation  exposure  in 
mouse auditory cells with  perfect accuracy,  which  may 
need validation in in vivo RF-exposure models.

Introduction 
RF  radiation  does  not transfer  high  enough  energy to 
break the covalent bonds of macromolecules, but these

low energy stimuli might be enough to induce molecular 
responses such as cell proliferation or cell death (Moulder 
eta/., 1999). While RF radiation itself can not mediate direct 
effects  on  DNA  and  proteins,  it  can  trigger  signaling 
pathways through changes in ionic distribution or membrane 
fluidity. In addition, the interactions between genes and RF 
radiation can lower the threshold of physiological changes, 
including various pathological conditions. 

The brain is the most important target tissue to study 
the biological effect of RF radiation in mobile phone users 
(Hardell eta/., 1999). There was a report on theincrease 
in  tumors  ipsilateral  to  the  side  of the  head  on  which 
subjects recalled phone use (lnskip eta/., 1999), but this 
was  not  substantiated  by  other studies  (Muscat  eta/., 
2000). RF radiation exposure to rat headsdid not affect the 
incidence,  malignancy,  volume,  multiplicity,  latency,  or 
fatality associated with any kind of neurogenic tumor (Zook 
and Simmens,  2006). 

Alteration  of cognitive  and  physiological  functions  of 
brains  upon  exposure  to  mobile  phone-frequency  RF 
radiation has been reported by several electrophysiological 
studies (Curcio eta/., 2005). In summary, RF exposure can 
induce  measurable  changes  in  human  brain  electrical 
activity, particularly in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) 
over posterior regions of the scalp. In addition, rats exposed 
to RF showed neuronal damage in the cortex, hippocampus, 
and basal ganglia (Salford eta/., 2003). However, this work 
was not reproduced by others (Joubert et at., 2007), and 
there are a number of points to consider regarding whether 
RF radiation can affect the human brain and its subsequent 
output in the form of cognition and behavior. 

Gene expression profiling with microarrays can provide 
valuable  information  on  the  characteristics  of  certain 
physiological and pathological conditions.  For example, 
gene expression profiles of -irradiated Jurkat cells showed 
p53-independent activation of the NF-B pathway (Park et 
a/.,  2002).  In  the  case  of RF  radiation,  the  expression 
patterns of HL-60 cells exposed to 2.45 GHz RF radiation 
were examined to select genes related to RF radiation (Lee 
et at.,  2005b).  We have used  HEI-OC1  mouse auditory 
cells to find biomarkers related to RF radiation-exposure, 
and  have developed  prediction models of RF-exposure 
using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms (Vapnik, 
1998)  with  selected  biomarkers  based  on  the  Weka 
environment (Witten and  Frank, 2005). 

Materials and Methods 

Cell culture 
Conditionally-immortalized HEI-OC1  auditory cells were 
kindly provided by Dr.  Kalinec (House Ear Institute, Los 
Angeles, CA, USA). Cells were cultured under permissive 
conditions (33°C 10% C02) in high-glucose Oulbecco's 
Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; GIBCO/BRL, Gaithers(cid:173)
burg,  Md.,  USA)  containing  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal 
bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO/BRL) and 50 U/mL gamma(cid:173)
interferon (Gernzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA) as previously 
described (Jat, 1991 ). 

RF exposure system 
The exposure system specifically designed for this study 
was reported previously by Lee eta/. in our laboratory (Lee 
eta!., 2006). For the PCS exposure system, a real COMA 
signal at 1762.5 MHz was applied. 

Cells were exposed to 1763 MHz RF radiation in 100 mm 
Petri dishes containing  18 mL of medium.  The exposure 
system was then warmed up for 30 min to equilibrate it before 
exposure of RF. RF radiation exposure was conducted at 
SAR values of 20 W/kg. During exposure, the temperature 
inside  the  chamber  was  maintained  at  33±0.2°C  by 
circulating water within the cavity. After an exposure of 24 
or 48 hr, the cells were transferred to a cell culture incubator 
for 5 hr and then harvested. For sham exposure, cells were 
incubated in the RF radiation device, but were not exposed 
to RF radiation. 

RF-exposure design 
HEI-OC1  mouse auditory cells were exposed to 20 W/kg 
of 1763 MHz RF radiation for 24 hr,  and then cells were 
incubated for 5 hr to recover from acute responses (R5 
group). Sham-exposed cells were harvestedin parallel (S5 
group). We repeated these sets of experiment threetimes 
to collect biological triplicates for every sample. 

RNA extraction and microarray 
Samples in each group were harvested, and their total RNA 
was extracted by dissolving cells in Trizol (Sigma). After 
fractions containing the  RNA were collected,  total  RNA 
was  purified  using Qiagen  RNeasy columns.  The array 
used in this experiment was the Applied Biosystems 1700 
full genome expression mouse microarray,which includes 
32,000 mouse genes from the public and Celera databases 
(http://www.pantherdb.org/). 

Data analysis 
Fluorescence  intensity  was  processed  and  measured 

Prediction of the Exposure to Radiofrequency Radiation  1 03 

using the  Applied  Biosystems  1700 Chemiluminescent 
Microarray Analyzer.  Intensity data were imported to an 
in-house microarray database. The overall procedure for 
constructing  a  prediction  model  to  discriminate  the 
exposure  of RF  radiation  using  the  microarray data  is 
shown in  Fig.  1. 

To  perform  reliable  microarray data analysis,  some 
probes  were filtered  out based  on  the following  3-step 
gene-filtering process. Firstly, control genes were excluded 
after checking their expression level. Then, unreliable inten(cid:173)
sities of probes were excluded  based on flag  information. 
Finally,  reliable  probes,  whose  ratio  of signal-to-noise 
intensity (SIN) was more than 3 in 50% or more of the total 
samples, were used to construct a prediction model. The 
threshold  of the  S/N  ratio  was  derived  from  a rigorous 
quality control test by Applied Biosystems that showed that 
if the S/N of a probe is more than 3, then the signal intensity 
of the probe is reliable with 99.9% confidence. As a result, 
15,040 probes were left. 

Quantile normalization was applied to remove systematic 
variance.  Quantile normalization is a simple yet powerful 
method  to  normalize  across  arrays  by  making  the 
distribution of probe intensities for each array in a set of 
arrays the same, and it reduces the variance slightly better 
than  Lowess normalization (Bolstad1  eta/., 2003).

We  sorted  genes  according  to  the  significance  of 
changes  in  gene  expression  levels  between  the  two 
groups  using  information  gain.  Information  gain  is  a 
measure of the effectiveness of a feature in classifying the 
training data (Mitchell, 1997). Given entropy Bntropy(S) 
as a measure of the impurity in a training data, information 
gain  IG(S,  F)  of a feature  F  relative  to  a collection  of 
samples sis the expected reduction in entropy caused by 
partitioning the samples according to this feature. Hence, 
the  information  gain  can  be  defined  as  the  difference 
between the entropy of the original collection  s and the 
expected value of the entropy after sis partitioned using 
feature  F as follows: 

JG(S,F) = Entropy(S)- L  lsi vii  Entropy(SJ 

veVa/ue(F)  S 

where  Value (F) is  the  set  of all  possible  values  for 
feature F, and sv is the subset of s for which feature F has 
value  v. 

To construct an optimal classification model to predict the 

exposure to RF radiation with a ninimal set of biomarkers, we 
adopted a recursive feature elimination (RFE) procedure 
(Furlanello, et al. 2003, G.Jyon, et al. 2002) based on infonnation 
gain  and  a support  vector  machine  (SVM)  algorithm 
(Vapnik, V.N., 1998). TheRFEprocedurererursivelyrernoves 
the features that cause the minimum variation with support 
vector machines (Guyon eta/. 2002). SVMs have exhibited 
superb  performance  in  binary  classification  tasks  that 
search for a hyperplane that separates two classes of data 
with the largest margin between the hyperplane and the 
point closest to it. At each model building step in RFE, a 
classifier  and  a  ranked  gene  set  are  constructed  and 
evaluated, and a single feature is eliminated at each step. 
Hence,the  basic  RFE  procedure  with  SVM  has  high 
computational cost. To speed up the RFE-SVM procedure, 
we  used  the  information gain-based  RFE  procedure to 
obtain an optimal gene subset for predicting the exposure 
of RF  radiation.  Gene  selection  with  RFE  procedures 
based  on  information  gaineliminates gene  redundancy 
effectively  and  yields  better  and  more  compact  gene 
subsets. We constructed prediction models with selected 
gene  subsets  using  a sequential  minimal  optimization

for  training  a support  vector  classifier  (Platt,  J.,  1998) 
based on the Weka environment (Witten and Frank, 2005). 
We estimated the  prediction error of the  model  with 
leave-one-out  cross-validation  (LOOCV)  (Tan,  et  a/., 
2005). Specifically, if the number of samples is n, LOOCV 
means that the cross-validation procedure is run n times, 
each time using one of the samples as the test set and the 
others  as  training  sets.  LOOCV  had  the  advantage  of 
utilizing as much data as possible for training. In addition, 
the test sets were mutually exclusive, and they effectively 
covered the entire dataset. Also, LOOCV seems to offer 
a chance of squeezing the maximum out of a small dataset 
and obtaining as accurate an estimate as possible (Tan, 
et at., 2005). 

Results and Discussion 
RF exposure to HEI-OC1  mouse auditory cells 
Upon exposure to 1763 MHz RF radiation, HEI-OC1  mouse 
auditory cells did not show any change in cell morphology 
or growth (unpublished data). We kept the cells in a C02 
incubator while cells were exposed to  RF radiation.  RF 
radiation  can  produce  heat  in  the  culture  media,  but 
isothermal  water  at  37"C  circulated  continuously  at  the 
bottom of the chamber throughout the experiment. Because 
we kept the chamber inside a C02 incubator, cells were 
completely  shielded  from  any  electromagnetic  field 
radiation generated from other electronic sources. For the 
sham group, we assembled the exact same experimental 
setup as in the RF exposure without applying the current. 

Information gain-based recursive feature elimination 
with SVM 
We identified a discriminative and compact gene subset 
for predicting the exposure of RF radiation according to the 

following procedure.  Firstly, genes were sorted by their 
information gain score. Then using RFE with SVM based 
on a binary search algorithm, we searched for the gene 
subset  with  the  highest  accuracy  and  minimal  size. 
Specifically, a binary search algorithm finds the median 
element gn in a sorted gene set, compares the prediction 
accuracy of the top n genes to the one that was previously 
computed based on the SVM algorithm, and determines 
if the prediction accuracy is greater than, less than, or equal 
to the previously-computed one, iteratively. The pseudo(cid:173)
code  of  the  information  gain-based  recursive  feature 
elimination procedure with SVM is shown in  Fig.2. 

By adopting information gain-based RFE with SVM in 
a  divide-and-conquer  approach,  we  could  effectively 
eliminate chunks  of uninteresting  genes  and  identify 9 
genes  with  perfect  classification  accuracy.  We  briefly 
summarize information about the 9 genes in Table 1.
