repeat terms are not well developed.

Abstract
Repetitive  sequences  such  as  SINE,  LINE,  and  LTR 
elements form a major part of eukaryotic genomes. A literature 
search tool that summarizes the information contained within 
repeat  elements  would  provide  biologists  in  the  field  of 
genomics with a useful tool for analyzing genomic sequence 
features. We developed a java program designed to make 
literature  access  easier  by  using  two  search  engines 
simultaneously. RepWeb is a web-based search system that 
provides a user friendly interface for searching the reference 
data and journals for information related to repeat elements 
by using the search engines, Google Scholar and PubMed, 
simultaneously. It provides an interface that displays the 
repeat element- related biological information, and includes 
useful functions such as the production of a repeat tree, 
clickable links to PubMed and Google Scholar, exporting, and 
sorting a field into date, author, journal and title.

Introduction
Repetitive DNA sequences include simple repeats and 
transposon-derived interspersed repeats such as SINE, 
LINE, and LTR transposons (Jurka et al., 2000). These 
sequences comprise a large part of the genomes of higher 
organisms. Despite the value of repetitive sequences, their

PubMed is one of the most important and powerful 
bibliographical information resources for biologists, and 
includes links to full text articles and other related resources 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?DB=pub
med). However, PubMed is not optimized to search for 
specific interests such as repeat elements.

The search engine, Google Scholar, provides a simple 
way to search for scholarly articles on a broad range of 
topics, within a large database. The Google Scholar service 
is based primarily on the full-text archives of some of the 
largest scholarly publishers, combined with some open 
access A/I databases, preprint and reprint repositories, and 
pages from presumably academic WEB sites. It provides 
not only a link to the cited and citing articles, but also 
calculates and reports the citation scores of those articles 
(Jacso, 2005). Its purpose is to locate scholarly literature 
across all disciplines in many formats and to offer the best 
scholarly search experience for users (Dean, 2005).

Repbase is a database of prototypic sequences of 
repetitive DNA from different eukaryotic species. Repeat 
library information can be acquired from Repbase, which 
is one of several databases for repeat genomic elements. 
However, Repbase does not provide information pertaining 
to journal articles that contain repeat terminology. 

The  Entrez  Programming  Utilities  (E-Utilities)  are 
comprised of seven server-side programs that are enlisted 
to provide a stable interface for the Entrez query and 
database utility at the National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI). The E-Utilities are based on a preset 
URL syntax designed to translate a set of input parameters 
into appropriate values that can be used with NCBI software 
to search for and recover the requested information. The 
E-Utilities make up the ordered interface to the Entrez 
system, and include 23 databases covering diverse sets 
of biomedical data, which include gene records, nucleotide 
and  protein  sequences,  three-dimensional  molecular 
structures, and biomedical literature (http://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=coursework.chapter.eutils).

In this paper we propose a web-based system, RepWeb, 
for searching reference information and journals related to 
repeat elements, which provides a user friendly interface. 
This  is  the  first  literature  search  web  tool  specifically 
designed to search for repeat elements reported to date.

Features of RepWeb
For the terms and classification of repeats, text and repeat 
information were obtained from the RepeatMasker library 
of  Repbase  (Ver.  11.10,  11-13-2006)  for  each  repeat 
element (Jurka  et  al., 2000) (Fig. 1). Repbase is a database 
of prototypic sequences representing repetitive DNA from 
different eukaryotic species. RepWeb relies on repeat 
dictionary,  query  terms,  and  word  filters  provided  by 
Google scholar and E-Utilities (Fig. 2). We can provide 
various filters (article filters, author filters, subject area 
filters, etc.) for these queries using E-Utilities and Google 
Scholar. For example, if a keyword has "Alu" in the repeat 
name search box, its search terms will be as follows in 

PubMed : "Alu"  and (repeat [tw] or "repetitive element" [tw] 
or "repetitive sequences" [tw] or "Repetitive Sequences, 
Nucleic Acid" [MH] or "Interspersed Re petitive Sequences" 
[MH]). In Google Scholar, they will be : intitle:alu + (repeat 
OR "repetitive element" OR "repetitive sequences" or "Repetitive 
Sequences,  Nucleic  Acid"  OR  "Interspersed  Repetitive 
Sequences").

These results are automatically parsed and assigned 
to each search engine when submitted. RepWeb also has 
a function to allow users to download each search result 
text file and its link to the Repbase database in the GIRI. 
The Web crawler and parser are implemented by Python, 
and Google Scholar is used to acquire more information 
from the WEB. The user can search using a specific search

term which will return hundreds of hits. After the initial 
search, Web Crawler delivers the results and parses the 
information. The final results are presented as a table on 
the web (Fig. 3C).

The  web  server,  RepWeb,  has  been  developed  to 

search journals related to the repeats in Repbase, Google 
Scholar  and  PubMed.  Through  the  web  interface, 
researchers are able to retrieve journals pertaining to the 
queried keyword within three resources. To acquire the 
journal-related  Repbase,  RepWeb  constructs  a  local

relational database which integrates two public databases; 
repeat library data and PubMed. RepWeb is a web interface 
based on a Tomcat server with dynamic content generated 
by a Java Server Page (JSP) and AJAX (Asynchronous 
JavaScript and XML). By applying these technologies, 
RepWeb provides users with a dynamic, responsive, and 
faster browser. The interface is presented as a repeat tree 
menu that allows users to search easily while selecting a 
particular repeat (Fig. 2B).

Results
RepWeb is a Java application that provides a user-friendly 
interface  for  searching  the  reference  information  and 
journals related to repetitive sequences within the genomes 
of various organisms. RepWeb has a distinctive advantage, 
in that it retrieves the results from two search engine sites 
simultaneously. It relies on two databases, using the search 
term results from Google Scholar and PubMed, and has a 
Repbase database which matches the Repbase library with 
information from PubMed. The application is freely available 
from http://www.repeatome.org or http://www.repweb.org 
or directly from http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr:8080/RepWeb. 

Future Directions
We will update the search function of RepWeb by sequence, 
and apply it to a gene pathway using our pipeline and web 
database system. RepWeb will continue to incorporate 
newly established repeat elements. The role of RepWeb 
in  providing  literature  information  for  biologists  will 
continue to adapt in line with new developments and the 
needs of researchers in this field.
