Abstract

The  biological  interpretation  of  two-dimensional  (2D)  gel 
electrophoresis  experiments  is  a  key  step  toward  under-
standing  the  functions  of  biological  systems.  We  here 
present  a  web-based 
integrated  database,  called 
2DSpotDB,  for  the  management  of  proteome  data  de-
rived  from  several  pathogens.  The  2DSpotDB  was  es-
tablished  as  a  part  of  the  management  of  a  pathogen 
proteome  project  at  the  Korea  National  Institute  of 
Health.  The  goals  of  the  2DSpotDB  implementation  are 
to  store  and  define  important  pathogen  genes,  retrieve 
information  obtained  by  2D  polyacrylamide  gel  electro-
phoresis  and  mass  spectrometry,  and  create  an  in-
tegrated  system  to  provide  pathogen  proteome  in-
formation  for  biological  scientists.  This  database  cur-
rently  contains  14  gels  and  information  on  387  protein 
spots,  among  which  329  proteins  were  identified  and 
annotated.

Introduction

The  post-genomic  era  has  seen  an  increasing  amount  of 
effort  on  massive  systematic  surveys  of  various  pro-
teomes  (Seger  et al.,  2009).  Researchers  in  the  bio-
medical  sciences  have 
increasingly  been  applying 
high-throughput  proteome  analysis  techniques  to  study 
the  direct  products  of  gene  expression,  molecular  inter-
actions  and  the  cellular  environment  since  the  intro-
duction  of  two-dimensional  (2D)  gel  electrophoresis  in

1975  (Klose,  1975;  O'Farrell,  1975;  Gerner et al.,  2000; 
Jiang et al.,  2004;  Wang et al.,  2010).  Proteome  analysis 
by  2D  gel  image  is  one  of  the  most  efficient  methods 
for  analyzing  the  proteomes  of  cells,  tissues  or  whole 
model  organisms  in  proteomics  studies.  Simultaneously, 
many  advances  have  been  made  in  the  field  of  liquid 
chromatography  coupled  with  tandem  mass  spectrome-
try  (LC-MS/MS)  quantitative  proteomics  for  large-scale 
complex  samples  using  the  observed  strong  correlation 
between  the  counts  of  protein-specific  spectra  or  pep-
tide  quantitation  obtained  by  mass  spectrometry  and 
the  absolute  and  relative  abundance  of  the  proteins  (Liu 
et al.,  2004;  Ishihama  et al.,  2005).  With  the  rapid 
growth  in  proteomic  raw  data  in  pathogen  laboratories, 
a  current  challenge  is  the  meaningful  management  of 
the  results  of  such  large-scale  studies,  including  spot 
identification  and  annotation  information  for  numerous 
2D  gel  images  (Berth  et al.,  2007).  Many  databases, 
such  as  ProDB  (Wilke et al.,  2003),  UAB  (Hill  and  Kim, 
2003),  DynaProt  2D  (Drews  and  Gorg,  2005)  and  2DB 
(Allmer  et al.,  2008),  have  been  developed  to  compete 
with  SWISS-2DPAGE  (Appel et al.,  1996)  and  its  protein 
identification  in  gel  images  in  the  past.
    Here,  we  report  the  development  of  the  2DSpotDB, 
which  provides  a  centralized  database  to  serve  the 
growing  needs  of  the  pathogen  proteomic  research 
community.  The  2DSpotDB  was  developed  as  a  part  of 
the  management  of  a  proteome  project  for  the  important 
pathogens  Bacillus  anthracis,  Clonorchis  sinensis, 
Neisseria gonorrhoeae and  Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
This  database  includes  2D  gel  images,  spot  identi-
fication  information,  annotation  information  and  various 
statistical  tables.  The  data  contents  have  generally  been 
deposited  to  share  major  sources  of  proteomic  patho-
gen  data  from  researchers  in  various  laboratories.  This 
information  can  enhance  analyses  related  to  the  func-
tions  of  pathogen-specific  biological  systems  involving 
antigenic  or  pathogenic  proteins  with  experimental  evi-
dence  and  shed  light  on  the  dynamic  variations  in  the 
pathogen  proteome  during  the  complex  physiological 
changes  linked  with  different  experimental  stages  and 
conditions.

Features  and  Results

Implementations

Data  acquisition  and  community  involvement

Updated  raw  data  and  information  for  the  2DSpotDB  is 
periodically  provided  from  the  pathogen  proteomic  re-
search  community  at  the  Korea  National  Institute  of 
Health  (KNIH).  Because  the  2DSpotDB  has  no  full-time 
automatic  updater,  expert  users  individually  access  and 
update  this  database  to  provide  the  pathogen  commun-
ity  with  integrated,  comprehensive  2D  proteomic  spot 
information  related  to  the  experimental  conditions.

Methods

The  2DSpotDB  website  is  a  relational  database  system 
(Oracle  11g)  running  on  Dell  PowerEdge  2580  servers 
using  the  Red  Hat  Linux  operating  system  (Red  Hat 
Enterprise  Linux  5.5  platform).  The  2DSpotDB  is  de-
ployed  in  a  ‘2-tier’  architecture,  divided  neatly  into  the 
presentation  tier  (the  user  interface)  and  the  data  stor-
age  and  access  tier  (the  database).  Users  can  submit 
experimental  and  analyzed  data  into  the  database  or 
search  queries  through  the  web  interface.  The  queries 
are  then  processed  using  the  Apache  web  server,  JSP 
(Java  Server  Pages),  JavaServelet  technology  and  cas-
cading  style  sheet  (CSS)  properties.  The  results  of  each 
query  are  presented  to  the  user  in  the  web  browser.

Here,  we  report  the  archiving  of  proteomic  2D  gel  im-
ages  and  spot  identification  information  for  four  major 
pathogenic  organisms  (B. anthracis, C. sinensis, N. gon-
orrhoeae and S. pneumoniae),  which  currently  consists 
of  information  on  387  protein  spots,  of  which  329  pro-
tein  spots  were  identified  and  annotated  from  14  gels. 
    The  Web  interface  is  divided  into  three  major  func-
tional  groups:  (i)  Proteome  information  (total  statistics, 
2D  gel  information  and  protein  spot  information),  (ii) 
Integrated  searching  based  on  Clone  ID,  accession  ID, 
or  description,  and  (iii)  Registration  (web  interfaces  for 
registered  users  for  manipulating  and  depositing  their 
2D  experimental  methods  and  spot  information)  (Fig. 
1A).  The  2DSpotDB  was  established  to  facilitate  and  en-
courage  proteomics  scientists  to  publish  gel-based  pro-
teomics  data.  The  2D  images  and  protein  spot  in-
formation  are  annotated,  uploaded  and  curated  by  au-
thorized  users  (Fig.  1B).  The  minimum  information  re-
quired  spans  the  gel  image(s),  a  spot  identification  list(s) 
with  the  corresponding  spot  identifiers,  the  X/Y  coor-
dinates  on  the  gel  and  the  protein  identifiers  and  any 
relevant  information  on  protocols  and  publications,  if 
available.
    For  each  specific  2D  gel  image  and  identified  protein, 
the  2DSpotDB  database  contains  the  following  in-
formation:  (i)  Detailed  experimental  descriptions  (Loading 
amounts,  Strip,  SDS-PAGE,  Staining  Method  and  IEF 
Conditions)  (Fig.  1C),  (ii)  General  spot  information  (Clone 
ID,  NCBI  ACC,  Mascot  score,  Matched  peptides,  Sequ-

ence  coverage,  pI,  MW,  Description  and  Remark)  (Fig. 
1D).  All  information  can  be  manually  curated.
    Currently,  proteomic  data  is  a  potentially  rich  re-
source,  but  proteome  peptide  identification  has  been 
considerably  underexploited.  For  the  identification  steps, 
using  bioinformatic  software  in  many  cases,  individual 
protein  spots  containing  protein  identifiers  and  exact  de-
scriptions  may  be  obtained  from  any  reference  public 
database,  but  it  has  frequently  been  observed  that 
these  protein  spots  have  no  protein  ID  due  to  uniden-
tified  genome  and  expressed  sequence  tag  data.  Thus, 
we  permit  the  protein  accession  numbers  of  the  identi-
fied  proteins  to  be  curated  and  updated  by  individual 
researchers  upon  further  study.

Discussion

In  our  study,  we  aim  to  find  out  antigens  which  can  be 
used  to  produce  new  candidate  vaccines  against  dis-
eases  competing  with  SWISS-2DPAGE  (Appel  et al., 
1996).  Thus,  we  will  present  a  database  application 
which  can  be  employed  in  many  antigen-experimental 
contexts  such  as  antigenicity  and  epitopes  information. 
The  2DSpotDB  database  is  expected  to  expand  further 
over  the  coming  years,  incorporating  new  species  in-
cluding Plasmodium vivax  and  many  viruses.  Advanced 
features  and  data  mining  tools  will  continue  to  be  in-
troduced  and  improved,  e.g.,  the  ability  to  make  biologi-
cal  classifications  using  gene  ontology,  a  comparison 
system  for  diverse  2D  images  according  to  different  ex-
perimental  methods  and  the  weighting  of  annotation 
results.  We  also  anticipate  that  pathogenic  proteomic 
data  will  continue  to  be  deposited  at  an  ever-increasing 
rate.
