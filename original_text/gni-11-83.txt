Genetic studies on facial morphology targeting healthy populations are fundamental in understanding the specific genetic 
influences involved; yet, most studies to date, if not all, have been focused on congenital diseases accompanied by facial 
anomalies.  To  study  the  specific  genetic  cues  determining  facial  morphology,  we  estimated  familial  correlations  and 
heritabilities  of  14  facial  measurements  and  3  latent  factors  inferred  from  a  factor  analysis  in  a  subset  of  the  Korean 
population. The study included a total of 229 individuals from 38 families. We evaluated a total of 14 facial measurements 
using 2D digital photographs. We performed factor analysis to infer common latent variables. The heritabilities of 13 facial 

measurements were statistically significant (p ＜ 0.05) and ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. Of these, the heritability of intercanthal 
width in the orbital region was found to be the highest (h2 = 0.61, SE = 0.14). Three factors (lower face portion, orbital 
region, and vertical length) were obtained through factor analysis, where the heritability values ranged from 0.45 to 0.55. 
The heritability values for each factor were higher than the mean heritability value of individual original measurements. We 
have confirmed the genetic influence on facial anthropometric traits and suggest a potential way to categorize and analyze 
the facial portions into different groups.

Introduction

In the context of bone morphology, the craniofacial region 
represents the most complex and special part of the body, 
consisting of 22 separate bones in addition to 22 deciduous 
and 32 permanent teeth [1]. Most skull bones are developed 
from neural crest cells, where the skull vault, mandible, and 
maxilla are formed from intramembranous ossification in 
the  mesenchyme  without  cartilage.  On  the  other  hand, 
bones from other parts of body are originated from meso-
derm and are formed from endochondral ossification. The 
human face is made from the fusion of 5 prominences (the 

fronto-nasal  prominence  and  two  pairs  of  maxillary  and 
mandibular prominences), which occur from the 4th to 10th 
weeks of development, where defects in the process result in 
many kinds of facial clefts [2].

Studies on human facial morphology can impact various 
areas, including plastic and dental surgery, facial anatomy, 
reconstruction, and constitutional diagnosis [3, 4], as well as 
studies on anthropology and genetics. Of these, the impli-
cation  of  genetic  factors  on  facial  morphology  has  been 
considered important in understanding hereditary disorders 
as well as tracing the anthropological origin [5, 6].

Genetic effects on facial measurements have been inve-

stigated  considerably  in  the  past.  Several  twin  studies 
evaluated  the  genetic  and  non-genetic  influence  on  facial 
traits [7-10]. One classical twin study showed significant 
genetic variance of alveolar bone height (h2 = 0.36) using 
intraclass correlation between twins (MZr = 0.70 and DZr = 
0.52) [7]. Another twin study found significant sex diffe-
rences  of  genetic  variance  in  anterior  face  height  and  no 
genetic  influence  on  angular  measurements  [8].  On  the 
other hand, several angle measurements, such as soft-tissue 
facial angle and Holdaway angle, were shown to have genetic 
effects [11] in a Turkish Anatolian siblings study.

Family studies, in addition to the twin studies, have re-
ported  several  key  findings  regarding  the  genetic  con-
tribution of facial traits [12-17]. In 1991, Kohn [13] found an 
important role of genetic influence on craniofacial growth. A 
family study based on ethnically homogeneous Chuvasha 
pedigrees  has  found  that  genetic  factors  substantially 
contribute to head shape, where the unadjusted estimates of 
heritability were found to range from 0.35 to 0.71 [14]. In a 
recent study using the Hallstatt skull, it was shown that the 
additive genetic variation accounted for approximately 30% 
of  the  phenotypic  variation  in  total  facial  dimensions 
(maximum facial breadth, length, and height) [16]. Familial 
correlation can also be used as an important indicator to 
grasp  genetic  and  environmental  proportions.  A  mor-
phological  characteristics  study  based  on  125  Belgian  fa-
milies  has  found  evidence  of  genetic  determination  in 
longitudinal body measurements and, to a lesser extent, in 
soft tissues and in nose or mouth regions [12].

There exist a variety of complex indicators for the mea-
surement  of  facial  size  and  length.  A  common  charac-
terization of facial measurements by reducing the dimension 
using factor analysis can be very helpful in understanding the 
genetics  behind  facial  morphology.  In  recent  years,  most 
studies based on this concept assessed 2 common factors: 
horizontal  components  (HOCs)  and  vertical  components 
(VECs). Several investigations found that the genetic effect 
was estimated differently between 2 factors [8, 10, 14, 18, 
19]. In these studies, however, the extraction of common 
latent variables in facial complex measurements was only 
limited  to  HOCs  and  VECs.  In  understanding  the  im-
plication  of  genetic  influence  of  facial  morphology,  other 
characterization methods in addition to the horizontal and 
vertical component could also be useful.

Although  many  researchers  have  studied  the  genetic 
effects on facial morphology, most of them have focused on 
congenital diseases accompanied by facial anomalies. Gene-
tic  studies  on  facial  morphology  targeting  healthy  popu-
lation of various ethnicities are therefore still lagging behind. 
The aims of this study were to infer common latent factors 
by analyzing the pattern found in a factor analysis of 14 facial 

measurements from the Korean population and investigate 
the  existence  of  genetic  effects  for  the  factors  through 
estimation of familial correlations and heritability. 

Methods
Subjects

The  study  was  approved  and  conducted  by the Korean 
Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM) from November 1, 
2006 to July 31, 2008. Three local clinical centers and 10 
hospitals were recruited for this work. Photographs for facial 
analysis were taken by trained investigators according to a 
standard protocol. To ensure the quality of the photographs, 
we took 2 facial pictures from both the front and the lateral 
side of each subject and selected the better representative 
pictures for the analysis. During the first and second phase of 
this  survey,  114  and  164  individuals  were  collected,  res-
pectively.  Subjects  with  poor-quality  photographs  were 
excluded from analysis. The study included a total of 229 
individuals from 38 families, and of these, one family had a 
large extended pedigree. All samples were of Korean origin. 
Anyone who had a facial anomaly or surgery was excluded in 
this study. The mean and standard deviation (SD) of parents’ 
age were 55.2 and 13.9, and those of the offspring’s age were 
36.0 and 17.4, respectively.

Facial measurements

Digital photographs used for facial measurements have 
the advantages of obtaining quick and permanent data [20]. 
To minimize the potential variability in the measurements 
among  different  centers,  a  single  digital  camera,  with  a 
standard protocol, was employed throughout the collection 
of data. To correct for distance variable, a standard sliding 
caliper was held by the subjects while taking photographs. 
The resulting images were sent to KIOM from each center. 
Twenty-five  landmarks  were  selected  and  produced  as 
described [21] using Image J program, an image processing 
program  developed  by  the  National  Institutes  of  Health 
(NIH) (Fig. 1). Each of these landmarks was recorded as 
coordinates in this program. A single measurement can be 
generated, representing the shortest distance between any of 
the  2  landmark  coordinates  of  choice.  Fourteen  of  such 
measurements described below were selected, which best 
represented the facial characteristic [21].

A total of 14 facial measurements in 5 regions (head and 
face, orbital, nose, mouth, and ears) were evaluated. For the 
head  and  face  region,  6  measurements  (physiognomical 
height  of  the  face [tr-gn],  height  of  the foreheadⅠ[tr-g], 
special upper face height [g-sn], height of the lower face 
[sn-gn], width of the face [zy-zy], and width of the mandible 
[go-go]) were recorded. Three measurements were collected

from the orbital region: intercanthal width (en-en), bino-
cular width (ex-ex), and length of the eye fissure (en-ex). 
The nose region had 3 measurements: height of the nose 
(n-sn),  width  of  the  nose  (al-al),  and  nasal  protrusion 

(sn-prn). One measurement each was taken from the mouth 
and ear regions: width of the mouth (ch-ch) and length of the 
auricle (sa-sba) (Table 1, Fig. 1).

To  minimize  intermeasurement  bias,  all  the  measure-

ments  were  taken  by  a  single,  well-trained  personnel.  To 
verify  the  robustness  and  reliability  of  the  measurement 
method employed herein, we also recorded the intraobserver 
precision of all 14 measurements on the 20 subsamples, of 
which  age  and  sex  were  taken  into  consideration.  The 
resulting mean intracorrelation coefficient was 0.93 (0.80- 
0.99), showing high reliability.

Statistical analysis

For the calculation of the mean and SD of 14 craniofacial 
measurements, only individuals with age ≥ 20 were used to 
control growth effects. In addition, all genetic analyses for 
estimating familial correlation and heritability included all 
age groups. 

To  estimate  the  common  latent  variable  in  facial  mea-
surements,  we  implemented  factor  analysis  using  SAS 
version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The eigenvalues for 3 
factors were greater than 1 (i.e., the cut-off of the eigen-
value), and the cumulative proportion was 79%. Orthogonal 
Varimax rotation and principal method were employed. The 
total number of factors used in this study was 3. The cut-off 
value  of  factor  patterns  was  above  0.6  [22,  23].  Before 
estimating the genetic effects, we calculated 3 factor scores 
for each individual and evaluated the normal distribution of 
facial measurements, including factor scores, by Quantile- 
Quantile (Q-Q) plot and Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s value. Most 
Q-Q plot lines were straight, and the measurements tended 
to follow a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s p > 
0.05). 

PEDINFO option in S.A.G.E. (2009; Statistical Analysis 
for  Genetic  Epidemiology,  Release  6.0.1;  http://darwin. 
cwru.edu/) was used to understand family information, such 
as offspring N and sibling N. 

Because  facial  measurements  depend  on  age,  sex,  and 
body mass index (BMI) of an individual, we used covariate 
variables, such as age, sex, age*sex, age2, age2*sex, and BMI. 
In  this  modeling,  the  significant  covariate  variables  were 
adjusted  by  screen  option  of  the  Sequential  Oligogenic 
Linkage  Analysis  Routines  (SOLAR)  package  [24].  As  a 
result, the residual variation, which is the remainder of the 
variation  among  phenotypes,  excluding  the  portion  per-
taining to be important covariates, was obtained and applied 
to approximate the familial correlation and heritability.

We used the FCOR option in S.A.G.E. to estimate familial 
correlations. Familial correlations were calculated by a set of 
two random variables    
  and arbitrary weights {wi} 
[25].

Narrow-sense heritability (h2) (proportion of phenotype 

variance attributable to additive genetic variance) was also 
estimated by maximum likelihood procedure using SOLAR. 
SOLAR employs a variance-components method, which has 
a  long  history  in  classical  genetic  study.  Additionally,  a 
bivariate  model  was  used  to  test  the  genetic  correlation 
between pairs of facial measurements within each factor. We 
estimated two parameters, based on maximum likelihood 
ratio  method:  additive  genetic  correlation  (ρG)  and 
environmental correlations (ρE). 

Results

Table  2  presents  the  sample  and  pedigree  information. 
The number of total samples used in this study is 229. The 
portion  of  females  (58.95%)  was  higher  than  males 
(41.05%).  In  the  pedigree  information,  the  size  of  each 
pedigree ranged from 2 to 94. One large extended family (n 
=  94)  provided  great  statistical  power  to  estimate  the 
inheritance of facial measurements. The number of parent- 
offspring and sibling pairs was 412 and 191, respectively. 
Among sibling pairs, the number of brother-sister pairs was 
the  largest  (93  pairs).  The  number  of  sister-sister  and 
brother-brother pairs was 54 and 44, respectively.

Basic statistics for the 14 original measurements in males 
and females are summarized in Table 3. Only those results 
with age ≥ 20 were considered, to account for the variable 
introduced by age. The mean value for males (n = 79) was 
significantly  higher  than  females  (n  =  120)  in  all  mea-
surements (p ＜ 0.05). 

Familial correlations and heritabilities of residual varia-
tion,  adjusted  by  significant  covariates,  are  presented  in 
Table 4. The mean contribution of significant covariates was 
0.27 and ranged from 0.10 to 0.51. As shown, the spousal

lower than the other correlations in most measurements. 
Except for height of the lower face (sn-gn), width of the 
mandible (go-go), length of the eye fissure (en-ex), width of 
the mouth (ch-ch), and length of the auricle (sa-sba), the 
correlations between parent and offspring were statistically 
significant (p  ＜ 0.05). The correlations between siblings 
were  statistically  significant  for  width  of  the  mandible 
(go-go), nasal protrusion (sn-prn), and length of the auricle 
(sa-sba).  The  heritabilities  of  13  facial  measurements, 
except  for  width  of  the  mouth  (ch-ch),  were  statistically 

significant (p ＜ 0.05) and ranged from 0.25 to 0.61. The 
heritability  of  intercanthal  width  (en-en)  in  the  orbital 
region was found to be the highest (h2 = 0.61, SE = 0.14), 
whereas in the nose region, width of the nose (al-al) showed 
the highest heritability (h2 = 0.53, SE = 0.13).

included intercanthal width (en-en), biocular width (ex-ex), 
and length of the eye fissure (en-ex), which were related to 
the orbital region. Factor 3 included physiognomical height 
of  the  face  (tr-gn),  special  upper  face  height  (g-sn),  and 
height  of  the  nose  (n-sn).  The  familial  correlations  and 
heritabilities of 3 factors are shown in Table 6. In Factor 1, 
the correlation of spouse (p ≥ 0.05) was lower than that of 
parent-offspring  and  sibling  pairs,  whereas  meaningful 
familial correlations were not found in Factor 2 or Factor 3. 
The heritabilities of 3 factors were statistically significant (p 
＜ 0.05) and ranged from 0.45 to 0.55. Factor 1, which was 
related  to  the  lower  face,  had  the  highest  value  for 
heritability (h2 = 0.55, SE = 0.12). 

Using a bivariate model, we examined genetic correlations 
for all pairs within each factor (Table 7). There were several 
pairs with a statistically significant genetic correlation (p ≤ 
0.05): the pair of height of the lower face (sn-gn) and width 
of the nose (al-al) (ρG = 0.79, SE = 0.23) for Factor 1, the 
pair of intercanthal width (en-en) and biocular width (ex-ex) 
(ρG  =  0.82,  SE  =  0.08)  and  the  pair  of  biocular  width 
(ex-ex) and length of the eye fissure (en-ex) (ρG = 0.81, SE 
= 0.09) for Factor 2, and the pair of physiognomical height 
of the face (tr-gn) and special upper face height (g-sn) (ρG

(g-sn) and height of the nose (n-sn) (ρG = 0.98, SE = 0.06)

Discussion

There are several distinctive features of facial morphology 
found in Koreans compared to western populations. First, 
the  nose  of  Koreans  tends  to  be  relatively  shorter  and 
broader than that found in Italians [26], Caucasians [27], 
and Latvian [28] populations. Koreans also have a relatively 
narrower face (zy-zy) and wider mandible (go-go), and eyes 
(en-ex) when compared to Italians and wider intercanthal 
width (en-en), narrower width of the mouth (ch-ch), and 
longer special  upper face height (g-sn) and  length of the 
auricle  (sa-sba)  than  Caucasians.  Compared  to  Latvians, 
Koreans have broader (zy-zy and go-go) and longer (tr-gn) 
faces, narrower binocular width (ex-ex) and length of the eye 
fissure (en-ex), and wider intercanthal width (en-en).

The heritabilities that were significant for 13 phenotypes 
had a wide range of values (h2 = 0.25-0.61). Previous papers 
have reported estimated heritabilities of craniofacial anth-
ropometric traits, and the results have been in agreement 
with ours. In one study based on an Indian population, the 
heritabilities of nasal height and breadth were 0.42 and 0.50; 
in addition, that of facial height and bizygomatic breadth 
were 0.41 and 0.61 [29]. Another study enrolling a Chu-
vasha  pedigree  reported  that  the  heritabilities  of  nasal 
height,  physiognomic  facial  height,  bizygomatic  breadth, 
and  bigonial  breadth  were  0.42,  0.38,  0.58,  and  0.50, 
respectively [14]. The other paper targeting orbital traits of 
Brazilians  reported  that  the  heritabilities  of  intercanthal 
width, biocular width, and length of the eye fissure were 
0.39, 0.34, and 0.51 [30]. Recently, we reported the herita-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  2,  2013

bilities and suggestive genetic loci associated with ocular 
and nasal traits in an isolated Mongolian population [31]. 
The  heritabilities  in  Mongolians  (h2  =  0.48-0.90)  were 
slightly higher than those of Koreans (h2 = 0.25-0.61). The 
difference between the two populations can be explained by 
the  low level  of genetic heterogeneity and  environmental 
effects in the isolated population model.

Several groups have reported that vertical facial variables 
displayed  greater  genetic  effects  than  horizontal  facial 
variables [8, 9, 32]. However, another group has challenged 
this by presenting an opposite result, although it was found 
not to be statistically significant [14]. The results obtained in 
our study support for a greater genetic effect of the hori-
zontal craniofacial variables, where vertical variables (tr-gn, 
tr-g,  g-sn,  and  sn-gn)  displayed  less  heritability  than  the 
horizontal variables (zy-zy and go-go). A similar pattern was 
also observed for the nose region.

We were able to identify 3 latent factors related to facial 
measurements through factor analysis (Table 5). Factor 2 
showed  relation  to  the  orbital  region:  intercanthal  width 
(en-en), biocular width (ex-ex), and length of the eye fissure 
(en-ex).  When we  consider the early  development of the 
face, there are very unique processes for making eyes and 
orbits.  Factor  2  may  be  related  with  one  of  the  common 
regulators  controlling  these  processes.  Factor  3  included 
vertical length values in the upper face region (special upper 
face  height  [g-sn]  and  height  of  the  nose  [n-sn],  and 
physiognomical height of the face [tr-gn]). Because all three 
values are related with vertical length of the nose (n-sn), this 
factor may be related with the early developmental process of 
the nose from the lateral and/or medial nasal prominence. 
Factor 1 was mainly related to the lower portion of the face－
height  of  the  lower  face  (sn-gn),  width  of  the  mandible 
(go-go), width of the nose (al-al), and width of the mouth 
(ch-ch)  and  this  part  was  made  from  the  maxillary  and 
mandibular  prominences  of  the  first  pharyngeal  arch. 
However,  there  remains  the  possibility  that  Factor  1  is 
related with a general factor rather than a specific regulator, 
because 7 of the 14 measurement values had loading scores 
above or very close to 0.6.

Such findings are indicative of a necessity to categorize 
each  facial  portion  into  different  classes  to  improve  our 
understanding of facial genetics. In previous studies, how-
ever, the concept of factor analysis in the genetic study of 
facial morphology was  mainly confined  to horizontal and 
vertical measures. Hence, this new concept of facial regions 
in the current report may provide significant insight into the 
genetic study of facial morphology. 

Factors that are explained by a common facial variable can 
have a higher genetic variance than each facial measurement 
[33]. Factor 1, related to the lower face, also indicated the

highest genetic variance (h2 = 0.55, SE = 0.12), which was 
significantly higher than the mean of each trait (mean h2 = 
0.36). The estimated heritabilities for Factor 2 and Factor 3 
also showed a similar trend (h2 = 0.52, SE = 0.15; mean h2 
=  0.44  and  h2  =  0.45,  SE  =  0.13;  mean  h2  =  0.34, 
respectively) (Table 6). They suggest that the factors reflect 
the genetic effect well than when compared to each original 
measurement in the regions.

Additionally,  this  study  employed  a  bivariate  model  to 
investigate  shared  genetic  effects  for  all  pairs  of  facial 
measurements within each factor. We estimated the genetic 
and  environment  correlations  and  found  5  pairs  with  a 
statistically significant genetic correlation: 1 for Factor 1 and 
2  each  for  Factor  2  and  Factor  3.  The  significant  genetic 
correlation ranged from 0.74 to 1.00, which suggested that 
there exists a large genetic portion simultaneously affecting 
facial measurements in each factor.

To date, various study designs have been employed for 
identifying the genetic effects of a specific trait where, in 
general, family, twin, or sibling designs were preferentially 
chosen. Amongst these three, the family design has many 
advantages. Firstly, familial correlation and relative risk can 
be  estimated  [34].  Secondly,  a  family  study  is  likely  to 
increase  statistical  power  for  finding  causative  genes  and 
inheritance modes [35] where, especially, a large expended 
pedigree provides sufficient evidence of linkage as well as 
maximum statistical power [36].

A variety of methods for measuring facial length or size 
have been introduced by many researchers [37]. Simple and 
direct measurement using calipers takes a lot of time and 
effort and has the probability of incorporating errors bet-
ween  different  observers.  Another  method  of  facial  mea-
surement  is  radiographic  cephalometry,  which  has  the 
advantage of observing hard tissue, such as bones, but this 
method is not suited for facial morphology, since it requires 
high cost and is time-consuming and is thus not suited for 
large-scale epidemiology. An alternative method used in this 
study was 2D digital photography. Although this method is 
difficult to locate bony structures under the skin, which is 
necessary to determine facial landmarks as well as measure 
curved surfaces, this has several advantages. The pictures are 
quickly  obtainable  and  the  measurements  can  be  per-
manently stored. Observers can be trained easily for precise 
and unbiased measurement. Radiographic cephalometry is 
selected  for  clinical  patient  care,  whereas  photographic 
method  is  better  for  investigating  facial  morphology  in  a 
large  epidemiological  study  [20],  thereby  suggesting  that 
each method for facial measurement should be chosen to fit 
the purpose of the study; we found our choice of photo-
graphic method to be reliable and useful in our study.

Our study has several new aspects and advantages: we 

provide the first reliable data for facial morphology for the 
Korean population; we tried a new approach to study faces 
using factor analysis; and the family data containing a large 
extended pedigree used in this study provided high stati-
stical power for estimating heritability. Yet, this study is not 
without caveats. The most obvious limitation in this study is 
the small sample size. Since the number of subjects was not 
large enough, the familial correlations between first-degree 
relatives, especially most sibling pairs, might not have been 
statistically significant. In our results, the familial correla-
tions of parent-offspring pairs were relatively more signi-
ficant than those of sibling pairs (Table 4). This is probably 
due  to  a  relatively  small  number  of  sibling  pairs  than 
parent-offspring pairs. For the heritability estimation of the 
14 phenotypes, the value for width of the mouth (ch-ch) was 
found to be the smallest and not statistically significant. This 
may be due to the change in facial expression while taking 
photographs  (emotion  or  tension),  causing  variability  in 
width of the mouth (ch-ch). Facial tension created during 
unusual situations, such as while taking photographs, can 
influence  the  measurements,  especially  for  the  width  of 
mouth,  because  of  the  likelihood  for  this  region  to  be 
affected by psychological tension compared to other mea-
surement parts. In addition, we were not able to provide 
enough data for each age in children, which is an important 
basis for the diagnosis of congenital facial anomalies. 

In conclusion, we have verified the genetic effect on facial 
anthropometric  traits  and  suggested  a  potential  way  to 
categorize  and  analyze  the  facial  portions  into  different 
groups. Despite many reports on congenital diseases with 
accompanying facial anomalies, the understanding of com-
mon  genetic  mechanisms,  including  specific  genes  that 
determine the facial morphology in general healthy popu-
lations,  is  still  obscure.  Our  report  is  a  step  towards 
understanding  this.  Validation  with  the  results  of  other 
studies involving varying populations, in addition to studies 
on genetic linkage association or biologic studies, is war-
ranted for furthering our understanding of this subject.
