Elevated serum uric acid levels are associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, including gout, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. Several genome-wide association studies on uric acid 
levels  have  implicated  the  ATP-binding  cassette,  subfamily  G,  member  2  (ABCG2)  gene  as  being  possibly  causal.  We 
investigated an association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2725220 in the ABCG2 gene and uric acid 
levels in the Korean population. A total of 991 subjects in Seoul City were used for a replication study with ABCG2 SNP 
rs2725220. The rs2725220 SNP in the ABCG2 gene was associated with mean uric acid levels (effect per allele 0.25 mg/dL, p 

＜ 0.0001). Subjects with the GC/CC genotype had a 1.78-fold (range, 1.22- to 2.62-fold) higher risk of having abnormal uric 
acid levels (≥7.0 mg/dL) than subjects with the GG genotype. When analyzed by gender, the association with ABCG2 was 
≥ 26.4 (odds ratio, 5.09; 95% confidence interval, 2.41 to 10.8) than in male subjects with BMI ＜ 26.4. This study clearly 

stronger in men than in women. The association with ABCG2 was much stronger in male subjects with body mass index (BMI) 

demonstrates that genetic variations in ABCG2 influence uric acid levels in Korean adults.

Introduction

Elevated  serum  uric  acid  levels  are  associated  with  a 
variety of adverse health outcomes, including gout, hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and cardio-
vascular  diseases  [1].  Several  genome-wide  association 
studies (GWASs) have identified genes that may be causally 
associated with uric acid levels, including the ATP-binding 
cassette,  subfamily  G,  member  2  (ABCG2)  gene  (MIM 
603756) [2-7]. Replication studies of ABCG2 variants have 
been  performed  in  Western  and  Asian  countries  [8,  9]. 
Okada et al. [4] identified a significant association between 
the rs2725220 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on 
chromosome 4q22 and uric acid levels.

The ABCG2 protein is a high-capacity transporter for uric 
acid excretion in the kidney, liver, and gut [10, 11]. In this 
study, we analyzed the relationship between uric acid levels 

and the ABCG2 SNP rs2725220 using a group of volunteers 
from  the  Korean  Metabolic  Syndrome  Research  Initiative 
Study  in  Seoul.  We  also  analyzed  the  association  of  the 
ABCG2 SNP with body mass index and waist circumference 
levels. 

Methods
Study population

Subjects for the GWAS were recruited from the Korean 
Metabolic Syndrome Research Initiative Study in Seoul City, 
which  was  initiated  in  December  2005.  A  total  of  9,128 
individuals were recruited in 2006, and an additional 17,569 
individuals were recruited in 2007 [12-14]. Therefore, the 
total Seoul City cohort included 26,697 volunteers. Volun-
teers  from  the  first  round  underwent  routine  health 
examinations at the health promotion centers in university 
hospitals between January 2006 and December 2007. From

this  total,  6,563  individuals  were  randomly  selected  for 
measurement  of  adiponectin  levels.  The  subject  charac-
teristics were described in a previous study [14]. In brief, of 
the  6,563  individuals  whose  adiponectin  was  measured, 
1,004 individuals were genotyped. The 1,004 subjects were 
all  healthy  individuals  and  were  not  undergoing  any 
treatment  for  hyperuricemia.  The  Institutional  Review 
Board of Human Research of Yonsei University approved the 
protocols of this study, and written informed consent was 
obtained from all subjects prior to enrollment.

Data collection

Participants  were  interviewed  using  a  structured  que-
stionnaire to collect a personal history of cigarette smoking 
(never smoked, ex-smoker, or current smoker) and demo-
graphic  characteristics  (age,  gender,  etc.).  Waist  circum-
ference was measured midway between the lower rib and 
iliac  crest. For measurements  of  weight and height, light 
clothing was worn. Body mass indices were calculated as the 
subject’s weight (kg) divided by the square of the subject’s 
height (m2).

For clinical chemistry assays, serum was separated from 
peripheral venous blood samples obtained from each parti-
cipant after a 12-hour fast and stored at –70oC. Biomarkers of 
metabolic syndrome, including fasting blood glucose, total 
cholesterol,  triglycerides,  and  high-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol,  and  uric  acid  levels  were  measured.  Quality 
control of the data was conducted in accordance with the 
procedures  recommended  by  the  Korean  Association  of 
Laboratory Quality Control.

Genotyping assays

Samples from the Seoul City cohort were genotyped on 
the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  Array  5.0 
(Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) at DNALink. For the 
data obtained from this chip, internal quality control (QC) 
measures  were  used:  the  QC  call  rate  (Dynamic  Model 
algorithm)  always  exceeded  86%.  Genotype  calling  was 
carried  out  using  the  Birdseed  (v2)  algorithm.  A  total  of 
1,004 individuals were genotyped using this platform. Ten of 
the 1,004 individuals were removed due to low genotyping 
call rates (＜95%). Three individuals were excluded due to 
failed  genotyping  of  rs2725220,  leaving  a  total  of  991 
individuals for the study. 

Statistical analysis

Data were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). 
Most statistical analyses were performed using PLINK and 
SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The ABCG2 
gene  SNP  rs2725220  was  selected  using  the  Affymetrix 
Genomewide Human SNP Array 5.0.

Each SNP was tested for possible effects on uric acid levels 
under an additive model. The multivariate linear regression 
models used in the study incorporated covariates (age and 
sex). Multiple logistic regression analysis was also perform-
ed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 
were calculated to examine the association of the ABCG2 
SNP with abnormal uric acid levels (≥7 mg/dL for men and 
≥6 mg/dL for women). All statistical tests were two-sided, 
and the statistical significance was determined as p ＜ 0.05.

Results

The majority of individuals in this study was middle-aged 
(Table 1). This sample of Korean volunteers had low uric acid 
levels on average. Mean levels of uric acid in the dataset were 
higher in males (6.23 mg/dL) than in females (4.21 mg/dL). 
The percentage of individuals with abnormal uric acid levels 
(≥7.0 mg/dL) was 14.7% for the Seoul City sample. The 
percentage of current smokers in the Seoul City dataset was 
46.4%  among  male  subjects  and  3.9%  among  female 
subjects.

Table 2 shows the p-values from a linear regression model 
for uric acid levels in the cohort sample, with age and sex 
included as covariates in the model. The rs2725220 SNP in 
the ABCG2 gene was found to be associated with mean uric 
acid levels (effect per allele 0.25 mg/dL, p ＜ 0.0001), which 
was significant after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.00025). 
The  minor  allele  frequency  of  rs2725220  was  0.222,  and 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was satisfied (p = 0.7079).

subjects with WC ＜ 91.

Discussion

In a cohort study of 991 subjects, an ABCG2 gene SNP was 
associated with increased uric acid, consistent with previous 
studies. Several GWASs have reported that ABCG2 exerts a 
major influence on uric acid levels [2, 3, 6, 7]. Dehghan et al. 
[6] conducted a genomewide study in which an SNP in the 
ABCG2 gene, rs2231142, displayed strong evidence of an 
–60). Another GWAS 
association with uric acid levels (p ＜ 10
also reported that rs2231142 showed a strong association 
–6) [2]. More recently, a 
with uric acid levels (p = 5.1 × 10
GWAS  in  European-American  obesity  cases  and  controls 
reported significant genome-wide association of two SNPs 
with uric acid levels: rs2622605 and rs1481017 [3]. Another 
recent  GWAS  also  reported  a  strong  association  between 
rs2231142 and uric acid levels (p = 3.34.1 × 10

–42) [7].

In  the  present  study,  rs2725220  was  found  to  have  a 
strong association with uric acid levels. In agreement with 
these findings, a recent study reported that rs2725220 was 
strongly associated with uric acid levels (effect per allele 
–0.135 mg/dL, p = 4.2 × 10
–30) [4]. Several recent studies 
reported that the association between serum uric acid and 
the allelic effects of SNPs in ABCG2 was sex-specific [8, 9]. 
In  a  recent  study  of  4  US  populations,  the  association 
between rs2231142 and serum uric acid was significantly 
stronger in men and postmenopausal women compared to 
their premenopausal counterparts [9]. In the present study, 
the association of the ABCG2 gene SNP with uric acid was 
stronger in men than in women.

Associations between genotypes and phenotypes can be 
modified by gene-environment interactions. A modification 
of the effect of the associations between ABCG2 SNPs and 
serum uric acid concentrations by interactions with obesity 
has  been  reported  [3,  9].  In  a  recent  study  of  4  US 
populations, the association between rs2231142 and serum 
uric  acid  was  stronger  in  normal-weight  subjects  than  in 
obese subjects [9]. In the present study, we also examined 
the  association  of  the  ABCG2  SNP  with  uric  acid  levels 
according  to  BMI  level  and  waist  circumference.  The 
association was stronger in subjects with a high BMI and 
high WC levels than in subjects with a low BMI and low WC 
levels. 

The  ABCG2  gene  encodes  a  membrane  transporter 
belonging to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of mem-
brane  transporters,  a  group  involved  in  the  trafficking  of 

biological  molecules  across  cell  membranes.  The  ABCG2 
gene contains 16 exons and spans over 66 kb [15]. Allikmets 
et al. [16] mapped the ABCG2 gene to human chromosome 
4q22 using radiation hybrid analysis.

Candidate  gene  analysis  suffers  from  population  sub-
structure. We estimated the identity by state over all SNPs, 
and  only  four  individuals  were  shown  to  be  biological 
relatives.  Genetic  studies  in  Asian  populations  may  not 
identify  the  same  set  of  genes  as  those  in  European 
populations [17]. Nevertheless, the Seoul City cohort study 
in  Korean  populations  indicates  that the ABCG2 gene on 
chromosome 4 is associated with serum uric acid levels, as is 
the case in several other populations.
