Acute myeloid leukemia is a well characterized blood cancer in which the unnatural growth of immature white blood cell 
takes place, where several genes transcription is regulated by the micro RNAs (miRNAs). Argonaute (AGO) protein is a protein 
family that binds to the miRNAs and mRNA complex where a strong binding affinity is crucial for its RNA silencing function. 
By understanding pattern recognition between the miRNAs-mRNA complex and its binding affinity with AGO protein, one 
can decipher the regulation of a particular gene and develop suitable siRNA for the same in disease condition. In the current 
work, HOXA9 gene has been selected from literature, whose deregulation is well-established in acute myeloid leukemia. Four 
miRNAs  (mir-145,  mir-126,  let-7a,  and  mir-196b)  have  been  selected  to  target  mRNA  of  HOXA9  (NCBI  accession  No. 
NM_152739.3). The binding interaction between mRNAs and mRNA of HOXA9 gene was studied computationally. From 
result, it was observed mir-145 has highest affinity for HOXA9 gene. Furthermore, the interaction between miRNAs-mRNA 
duplex of all chosen miRNAs are docked with AGO protein (PDB ID: 3F73, chain A) to study their interaction at molecular level 
through an in silico approach. The residual interaction and hydrogen bonding are inspected in Discovery Studio 3.5 suites. 
The current investigation throws light on understanding of AGO-assisted miRNA based gene silencing mechanism in HOXA9 
gene associated in acute myeloid leukemia computationally.

Introduction

MicroRNAs  (miRNAs)  are  small  non-coding  single 
stranded  RNAs  (~18-22  bp)  found  in  most  eukaryotes, 
playing a crucial role in a wide range of biological processes, 
such as host-viral interaction, apoptosis, stem cell maintenance, 
and metabolism, etc. miRNAs are involved in gene silencing 
mechanisms by targeting un-translated regions of mRNA 
through sequence complementarity [1, 2], and approximately 
30% of protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs [3]. 
As  many  genes  can  be  regulated  by  a  single  or  multiple 
miRNAs, an immense interest has been created to understand 

miRNA-based gene regulation through the identification of 
miRNAs, as well as their target genes. The Argonaute (AGO) 
class  of  proteins  plays  a  crucial  functional  role  in  the 
molecular recognition of miRNA-mRNA hybrids during the 
process of gene regulation [4, 5], and mutations in either the 
sequence  of  miRNAs  or  the  miRNA  target  sites  have  a 
significant contribution in the manifestation of cancer due to 
the loss of gene regulation [5, 6].

Leukemia is a cancer of white blood cells that is commonly 
classified  as  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML),  acute  lym-
phoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia. 
AML  is  a  well-characterized  blood  cancer  in  which  the 
unnatural growth of immature white blood cells takes place,

RP Das,  et  al.  Molecular Interaction of miRNAs and Target Gene

where  several  genes  involved  are  either  up-regulated  or 
down  regulated  by  miRNAs.  Though  the  importance  of 
miRNAs in gene regulation [2-5, 7, 8] and their regulation by 
RNA-induced silencing complexes [7] are well established, 
the  mechanism  of  miRNA-induced  gene  silencing  at  the 
molecular  level  is  still  unclear  [9,  10].  Despite  several 
detailed  research  studies,  controlling  abnormal  cell  pro-
liferation at the molecular level through miRNA-mediated 
gene silencing is still a major challenge. Therefore, with the 
current knowledge, attempts have been made to study the 
AGO  protein-assisted  molecular 
interaction  between 
miRNAs  and  their  target  genes,  and  a  computational 
approach [11] in this regard will be of great aid and value. 
Here, in this study, the HOXA9 gene was selected from the 
literature  as  an  important  target  in  AML,  and  in  silico 
approaches, like miRNA target site prediction, miRNA-mRNA 
duplex  prediction,  and  molecular  docking  between  AGO 
protein and four miRNAs, such as mir-145, mir-126, let7a, 
and mir-196b [8, 12, 13], were conducted to elucidate the 
AGO  protein-assisted  molecular 
interaction  between 
miRNAs and the HOXA9 gene in association with AML [14, 
15] computationally. 

Methods
Selection of HOXA9 gene as a target in AML

The leukemia gene database (http://www.bioinformatics. 
org/legend/leuk_db.htm)  documented  the  AF10,  NUP98, 
CBFB, NUP214, HOXA9, CREBBP, ARHGEF12, CDX2, LCP1, 
CEBPA, DEK, FUS, and RUNX1 genes to be involved in AML. 
Among them, the HOXA9 gene is reported to have major 
relevance  to  their  regulatory  functions  and  aberrant  ex-
pression in both mice and humans [14, 15]. Furthermore, 
identification of miRNAs that target the HOXA9 gene would 
help us to understand its interaction at the molecular level in 
AML conditions.

Selection of miRNAs targeting the HOXA9 gene

Firstly, from the literature, the miRNAs with affinity for 
the HOXA9 gene were identified [12, 13], which was further 
verified by prediction of miRNA target sites in the HOXA9 
gene using the miRTarBase web server (http://mirtarbase. 
mbc.nctu.edu.tw/). The search showed four miRNAs−namely, 
mir-145,  mir-126,  let-7a,  and  mir-196b−that  have  target 
sites within HOXA9 (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Two 
different binding sites were identified for mir-196b in the 
HOXA9 gene, denoted mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2, respectively.

Prediction of duplex between miRNAs and mRNA of 
the HOXA9 gene

A computational approach was carried out to study the 

binding mode of selected miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, 
mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) with the mRNA of HOXA9 to 
confirm the selection of the best miRNA. The properties, like 
predicted binding sites of HOXA9 for miRNAs (Supplementary 
Table 3) and minimum free energy (MFE) score of duplex 
interactions,  were  used  for  confirmation  of  binding.  Two 
different duplexes were formed for mir-196b (represented as 
mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2) with HOXA9 due to the iden-
tification of two target sites in HOXA9 (Supplementary Table 
3). The MFE scores for folding of miRNAs and the mRNA 
duplex (Supplementary Table 4) were calculated using the 
mfold web server (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/? q=mfold). 
The appropriate secondary structures of miRNAs and the 
mRNA  duplex  (Supplementary  Table  4)  were  predicted 
using the Centroid Fold web server (http://www.ncrna.org/ 
centroidfold/). The prediction of tertiary structures of the 
duplex were performed in 3dRNA web server (http://biophy. 
hust.edu.cn/3dRNA/3dRNA.html) using dot bracket struc-
tures (Supplementary Table 4) that resulted from the Centroid 
Fold.

Molecular interaction between miRNAs and AGO 
protein 

To illustrate the assistance of catalytic AGO protein for the 
binding of miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, 
and mir-196b.2) with the HOXA9 gene, docking between 
AGO protein and miRNA-mRNA duplexes was performed 
in the PachDock online server [16]. The PachDock algorithm 
ranked the docked complexes on the basis of geometrical 
shape  complementary  scores.  Close  amino  acid  residue 
interactions and participating atoms in hydrogen bonding 
were  inspected  and  analyzed  in  the  Discovery  Studio  3.5 
suite  (http://accelrys.com/products/discovery-studio/vis-
ualization- download.php).

Results
Duplex interaction between miRNAs and mRNA of 
the HOXA9 gene

The leukemia gene database search result, supported by 
literature  evidence  [14,  15],  signifies  that  HOXA9 (NCBI 
accession No. NM_152739.3) has aberrant expression at the 
molecular level and was therefore selected as a target gene in 
AML. Four miRNAs−namely, mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and 
mir-196b  (Supplementary  Table  2)−were  taken  from  the 
literature, and their target sites in the HOXA9 gene were 
verified through the miRTarBase web server. The predicted 
binding regions in the HOXA9 gene (Supplementary Tables 1 
and 3) for the miRNAs above were supported by good MFE 
scores  calculated  for  the  miRNAs  and  mRNA  duplex 
(Supplementary Table 4) using the mfold web server, which

implicates a strong affinity between them at the molecular 
level. Three-dimensional binding modes of all miRNAs and 
mRNA duplexes (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, mir-196b.1, and 
mir-196b.2) were constructed and deciphered (Fig. 1A–1E) 
using the Discovery Studio 3.5 suite.

Study of binding affinity between miRNAs and AGO 
protein through docking

The  three-dimensional  structure  of  AGO  protein,  with 
685 amino acid residues, was retrieved from Protein Data 
Bank  (PDB  ID:  3F73,  chain  A).  The  AGO  protein  is  a 
silencing complex structure with a seed containing guide 
DNA and target RNA duplexes. The structure preparation 
and  correction  of  AGO  protein  were  performed  in 
Discovery  Studio  3.5  suite  before  docking.  The  docking 
between  miRNA-mRNA  duplexes  (mir-145,  mir-126, 
let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2) and AGO protein was 
carried out separately in the PachDock online server on the 
basis of geometrical shape complementary scores. Out of 10 
binding  complexes  generated  for  each  miRNA-mRNA 
duplex  docked  with  AGO  protein,  the  highest-scoring 
complex was chosen as the best binding mode. However, a 
good dock score in all cases of docking between the selected 
miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, and mir-196b) and AGO 
protein implicated a strong interaction between them at the 
molecular level (Supplementary Table 5).

Study of interaction between miRNAs and AGO 
protein at the molecular level 

Strong hydrophobic amino acid residues and amino acids 
with  aromatic  rings,  which  are  relatively  hydrophobic  in 
nature, generally take part in hydrophobic interactions and 
contribute towards the stability in binding moieties while 
the  protein  interacts  with  macromolecules.  From  the 
inspection  of  the  close  amino  acid  residues  of  AGO 
protein surrounding the miRNAs (mir-145, mir-126, let-7a, 
mir-196b.1,  and  mir-196b.2),  some  strongly  hydrophobic 
amino acids, like LEU 652, LEU 267, ALA 644, and ALA 648 
in mir-145; LEU 267, LEU 277, LEU 279, LEU 281, ALA 278, 
ALA 648, and VAL 606 in mir-126; LEU 267, LEU 279, LEU 
281, and ALA 278in let-7a; ALA 111, VAL 58, and LEU 132 
in  mir-196b.1;  and  VAL  549,  VAL  152,  and  ALA  170  in 
mir-196b.2, were observed within a distance of 3.5 Å (Table 1, 
Fig. 2A–2E). Similarly, amino acids, like TYR 642, PHE 649, 
and PHE 647 in mir-145; PHE 649 in mir-126; and TYR 171 
and TYR 135 in mir-196b.2, with aromatic rings were also 
found in the binding pocket of miRNAs (Table 1, Fig. 2A–2E) 
within a distance of 3.5 Å. The study of hydrogen bonding 
patterns between atoms is another major parameter to study 
the stability of interactions between bio-molecules at their 
atomic level. Some amino acids, like ARG 615, ARG 651, HIS 
445, and PHE 649 in mir-145; SER 280, HIS 607, and THR

Discussion

The  current  study  focused  on  in  silico  verification  of 
miRNAs for targeting the HOXA9 gene, associated in AML, 
and the molecular interaction of catalytic AGO protein with 
these  miRNAs  to  study  the  gene  silencing  mechanism 
computationally. As the literature has reported [12, 13], four 
mature  miRNAs−namely,  miR-145,  mir-126,  let-7a,  and 
mir-196b−are found to have target sites in the HOXA9 gene 
and were hence taken for further study. The binding sites in 
HOXA9 were predicted for these miRNAs using miRTarBase 
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 3), which was followed by the 
secondary structure prediction and miRNA-mRNA duplex 
formation. Two binding sites were predicted for mir-196b 
in  the  HOXA9  gene  (Supplementary  Table  1),  denoted 
mir-196b.1 and mir-196b.2, respectively; so, two duplexes 
are  formed  between  mir-196b  and  mRNA  of  the  HOXA9 
gene  (Supplementary  Table  3).  The  results  suggested  a 
strong and energetically favorable binding mode between all 
miRNA-mRNA duplexes (Supplementary Table 4), which is 
also supported by the reported interaction between them 
(Fig. 1). The good MFE score (–5.90 kcal/mol) also reflected 

that mir-145 had the highest binding affinity for the HOXA9 
gene  (Supplementary  Table  4)  among  all  miRNAs.  Fur-
thermore, to study the molecular interaction between AGO 
protein  and  miRNA-mRNA  duplexes  (miR-145,  mir-126, 
let-7a, mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2), molecular docking was 
carried out. The presence of strong hydrophobic amino acid 
residues (LEU 652, LEU 267, ALA 644, and ALA 648 in 
mir-145; LEU 267, LEU 277, LEU 279, LEU 281, ALA 278, 
ALA 648, and VAL 606 in mir-126; LEU 267, LEU 279, LEU 
281, and ALA 278 in let-7a; ALA 111, VAL 58, and LEU 132 
in  mir-196b.1;  and  VAL  549,  VAL  152,  and  ALA  170  in 
mir-196b.2) within a distance of 3.5 Å in the binding pocket 
of  miRNAs  implicates  strong  binding  interactions  at  the 
molecular  level  between  AGO  protein  and  all  chosen 
miRNAs  (Table  1,  Fig.  2A–2E).  Also,  amino  acids  with 
aromatic rings (TYR 642, PHE 649, and PHE 647 in mir-145; 
PHE  649  in  mir-126;  and  TYR  171  and  TYR  135  in 
mir-196b.2) were also observed within a distance of 3.5 Å, 
which supports the binding interaction (Table 1, Fig. 2A–2E) 
between AGO protein and miRNAs. The amino acid residues 
participated in hydrogen bonding (Table 2, Fig. 3A–3E) with 
miRNAs  (miR-145,  mir-126,  let-7a,  mir-196b.1,  and 
mir-196b.2)  within  a  distance  of  3.0  Å,  showing  strong 
evidence  of  binding  and  a  molecular  interaction  between 
AGO  protein  and  all  chosen  miRNAs.  The  current 
investigation  proved  that  mir-145,  mir-126, 
let-7a, 
mir-196b.1, and mir-196b.2 have strong binding affinity

derstanding miRNA-based gene silencing mechanisms for 
the HOXA9 gene in AML disease. Furthermore, a molecular 
dynamic  simulation  approach  might  be  implemented  to 
study  the  dynamic  behavior  of  these  interactions,  which 
would help us better understand miRNA-based gene silencing 
mechanisms  in  AML  computationally.  Once  validated 
experimentally, this methodology would further help us to 
design suitable miRNAs against respective genes rationally.
