The tyrosine-protein kinase Tec (TEC) is a member of non-receptor tyrosine kinases and has critical roles in cell signaling 
transmission, calcium mobilization, gene expression, and transformation. TEC is also involved in various immune responses, 
such as mast cell activation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TEC polymorphisms might be involved in aspirin-exacerbated 
respiratory disease (AERD) pathogenesis. We genotyped 38 TEC single nucleotide polymorphisms in a total of 592 subjects, 
which comprised 163 AERD cases and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma controls. Logistic regression analysis was performed to 
examine the associations between TEC polymorphisms and the risk of AERD in a Korean population. The results revealed that 
TEC polymorphisms and major haplotypes were not associated with the risk of AERD. In another regression analysis for the 
fall rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) by aspirin provocation, two variations (rs7664091 and rs12500534) 
and  one  haplotype  (TEC_BL2_ht4)  showed  nominal  associations  with  FEV1  decline  (p  =  0.03－0.04).  However,  the 

association signals were not retained after performing corrections for multiple testing. Despite TEC playing an important role 
in immune responses, the results from the present study suggest that TEC polymorphisms do not affect AERD susceptibility. 
Findings from the present study might contribute to the genetic etiology of AERD pathogenesis.

Introduction

Asthma is a disease that is caused by inflammation in the 
lung and bronchus and is affected by genetic and environ-
mental influences. Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease 
(AERD),  which  was  first  reported  in  1922,  is  a  type  of 
asthma. AERD is characterized by the following three symp-
toms: bronchial asthma, aspirin sensitivity, and nasal poly-
posis [1-3]. It has been reported that 10－20% of asthma 
patients  have  aspirin  sensitivity,  whereas  1－2%  of  the 

non-asthma  population  shows  aspirin  sensitivity  [4,  5]. 
Although the mechanisms of AERD pathogenesis are still 
not fully understood, inflammatory responses by overpro-
duction  of  leukotrienes  are  regarded  as  the  main  patho-
genesis of AERD.

Aspirin is a commonly used medication, which belongs to 
the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Despite being a 
widely used medication, aspirin intake also causes various 
side  effects,  including  manifested  gastrointestinal  ulcer, 
stomach bleeding, and tinnitus, especially in higher doses. 
Although the side effects of aspirin are not common, these

effects have been reported in about 10% of adult asthmatics. 
In  AERD  pathogenesis,  aspirin  inhibits  the  activation  of 
cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme, leading to block of production of 
prostaglandin  and  thromboxane.  This  mechanism  causes 
overproduction  of  leukotrienes,  such  as  leukotriene  B4, 
leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 [6, 7].

The tyrosine-protein kinase Tec (TEC) is a member of the 
non-receptor tyrosine kinases and has critical roles in cell 
signaling transmission, calcium mobilization, gene expres-
sion, and transformation [8]. It has been known that TEC 
family kinases are associated with various intracellular sig-
naling mechanisms, such as cytokine receptors and lympho-
cyte surface antigens [9, 10]. In particular, it was demon-
strated that the TEC family proteins are involved in regu-
lation of leukotriene  secretion via the mast cell signaling 
pathway [11]. Therefore, we hypothesized that TEC poly-
morphisms might be involved in AERD pathogenesis. In the 
present  study,  38  TEC  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  were genotyped  in  a  total of  592  subjects,  which 
comprised 163 AERD cases and 429 aspirin-tolerant asthma 
(ATA) controls, to examine the associations between TEC 
polymorphisms and AERD susceptibility.

Methods
Study subjects

Subjects in this study were recruited from the Asthma 
Genome Research Center, comprising the hospitals of Soon-
chunhyang,  Chunnam,  Chungbuk,  Seoul  National,  and 
Chung-Ang  Universities  in  Korea.  All  subjects  provided 
written  informed  consents,  and  the  study  protocols  were 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  2,  2014

approved by the institutional review board of each hospital. 
Diagnosis of AERD was performed according to a modified 
method  as  previously  described  [12].  We  also  performed 
aspirin challenge in subjects with a history of aspirin hyper-
sensitivity, presence of urticaria, nasal polyp, and sinusitis. 
The AERD case group included patients with 20% or greater 
decreases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or 
15% to 19% decreases in FEV1 with naso-ocular or cuta-
neous reactions, whereas subjects showing a rate of FEV1 
decline less than 15% without extrabronchial nasal or skin 
symptoms  were  included  in  the  ATA  group.  The  clinical 
diagnostic factors for the present study are summarized in 
Table 1.

SNP selection and genotyping

To  investigate  the  associations  between  TEC  polymor-
phisms and the risk of AERD, we selected candidate SNPs 
based on allele frequencies in the Asian population, linkage 
disequilibrium  (LD)  status,  and  National  Center  for  Bio-
technology  information.  The  data  for  selection  were  ob-
tained  from  the  International  HapMap  database  (http:// 
hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).  Genotyping  of  38  TEC  poly-
morphisms  was  performed  in  a  total of  592  subjects,  in-
cluding 163 AERD cases and 429 ATA controls. Genotyping 
was carried out with 20 ng of genomic DNA by TaqMan assay 
using  ABI  prism  7900HT  sequence  detection  system 
software version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, 
USA) in all subjects. Assay IDs of all SNPs used in TaqMan 
assay are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Statistics

We applied a widely used measure of linkage disequili-
brium to all pairs of biallelic loci: Lewontin’s D' (|D'|) [13] 
and r2. Haplotypes of each individual were inferred using the 
PHASE algorithm (ver. 2.0), developed by Stephens et al. 
[14]. Linear regression analysis was performed to examine 
the  differences  in  the  rates  of  decline  in  FEV1  following 
aspirin  challenge  among  the  genotypes  and  major  haplo-
types. The data were managed and analyzed using Statistical 
Analysis  System,  version  9.2  (SAS  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA). 
Associations for AERD under the logistic model were adju-
sted by smoking status, atopy, body mass index (BMI), age, 
and sex (male = 0, female = 1). Significant associations are 
shown in boldface (p < 0.05). 

Results and Discussion

We recruited a total of 592 subjects, which consisted of 
163 AERD cases and 429 ATA controls, for the present study. 
According to the results, four clinical characteristics showed 
significant differences between the case and control groups 
(Table 1). The fall rate by aspirin provocation was signifi-

cantly higher in AERD subjects than ATA controls (24.63 ± 
16.11 vs. 3.54 ± 4.85; p = 0.0001). Percentage of predicted 
FEV1 in the AERD subjects showed decreased lung function 
than in ATA subjects (87.58 ± 16.94 vs. 91.66 ± 16.87; p = 
0.009). Also, age of first medical examination and BMI were 
lower in AERD cases than ATA controls. The other diag-
nostic factors showed no significant differences between the 
case and control group.

In the present study, 38 TEC polymorphisms and 12 major 
haplotypes were used for the association analyses. Locations 
of the polymorphisms are shown in a genetic map of TEC 
with their LD status (Fig. 1A). Minor allele frequencies 
(MAFs) of the SNPs in Korean subjects are displayed in 
Supplementary Table 2 with their allele change, position, 
and p-value for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. All SNPs were 
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The LD blocks were ob-
tained by using HaploView software, and the haplotypes of 
each LD block were calculated by PHASE software (Fig. 1B 
and 1C). We used major haplotypes that had frequencies 
higher than 0.05 for further analyses. The minor haplotypes 
that had frequencies lower than 0.05 were merged and 
presented as ‘Others.’ To compare genetic differences among 
ethnicities, we obtained MAFs of Caucasians, Han Chinese,

JS  Lee,  et  al.  Association  between  TEC  SNPs  and  the  Risk  of  AERD

Japanese,  and  Africans  from  the  NCBI  database  (dbSNP) 
(Supplementary  Table  2)  and  calculated  LD  blocks  using 
genotype  data  from  the  International  HapMap  database 
(Supplementary  Fig.  1).  As  a  result,  Asian  populations 
showed similar MAFs, whereas the other populations showed 
distinct differences. However, we did not find any correlation 
in LD status in any ethnicity.

Logistic analyses were performed to investigate the asso-
ciations between TEC polymorphisms and the risk of AERD. 
The result from analyses revealed that all SNPs and major 
haplotypes were not associated with the risk of AERD (Table 
2). On the other hand, two SNPs (rs7664091, p = 0.04 and 
rs12500534, p = 0.03) and one major haplotype in LD block 
2 (TEC_BL2_ht4, p = 0.03) showed marginal associations in 
the regression analysis with the decline rate of FEV1 (Supple-
mentary Table 3). However, the association signals of these 
polymorphisms disappeared after performing corrections for 
multiple  testing  (data  not  shown).  Taken  together,  these 
results indicate that the TEC polymorphisms are not asso-
ciated  with  AERD  susceptibility,  at  least  in  the  Korean 
population. The lack of associations in this study suggests 
that  although  TEC  plays  an  important  role  in  immune 
responses, TEC variants do not directly affect decreased pul-
monary function by aspirin uptake. However, considering 
the fact that the difference in frequency of polymorphisms 
showed different effects in various populations, replication 
studies in  AERD subjects in  other ethnicities are recom-
mended.

The present study still had several limitations. First, an 
average statistical power of 66.41% indicated an insufficient 
sample size. However, the rare condition of AERD made it 
difficult  to  recruit  subjects  in  the  Korean  asthma  cohort. 
Second, SNPs in coding sequence were not selected, due to 
very  low  frequencies,  although  non-synonymous  SNPs 
(nsSNP) in exonic regions could affect risk of the disease. 
Further studies are required to examine the molecular role of 
nsSNPs in TEC.

In conclusion, we hypothesized that TEC might impact on 
AERD susceptibility. However, our results showed that 38 
TEC  polymorphisms  and  12  major  haplotypes  were  not 
associated with the risk of AERD. Although further studies 
are required to investigate the exact role of the TEC SNPs in 
immune responses, the preliminary results of the present 
study  may  provide  useful  information  for  AERD  patho-
genesis.
