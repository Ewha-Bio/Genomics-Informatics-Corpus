Abstract

Chronic  inflammation  has  been  implicated  as  one  of  the 
important  etiological  factors  in  insulin  resistance  and 
type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM).  To  investigate  the  role 
of  anti-inflammatory  cytokines  in  the  development  of 
T2DM,  we  conducted  a  case-control  study  to  assess 
the  association  between  IL4/IL4R  polymorphisms  and 
disease  risk.  We  firstly  identified  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNP)  at  IL4  and  IL4RA  loci  by  sequencing 
the  loci  in  Korean  participants.  Case-control  studies 
were  conducted  by  genotyping  the  SNPs  in  474  T2DM 
cases  and  470  non-diabetic  controls  recruited  from 
community-based  cohorts.  Replication  of  the  associated 
signals  was  performed  in  1,216  cases  and  1,352  con-
trols.  We  assessed  effect  of  IL4-IL4RA  interaction  on 
T2DM  using  logistic  regression  method.  The  functional 
relevance  of  the  SNP  associated  with  disease  risk  was 
determined  using  a  reporter  expression  assay.  We  iden-
tified  a  strong  association  between  the  IL4  promoter 
variant  rs2243250  and  T2DM  risk  (OR=0.77;  95%  CI, 
0.67∼0.88;  p=1.65×10－4  in  the  meta-analysis).  The  re-
porter  gene  expression  assay  demonstrated  that  the 
presence  of rs2243250  might  affect  the  gene  expression 
level  with  ∼1.5-fold  allele  difference.  Our  findings  con-
tribute  to  the  identification  of IL4  as  a  T2D  susceptibility 
locus,  further  supporting  the  role  of  anti-inflammatory 
cytokines  in  T2DM  disease  development.

Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  is  one  of  the  diseases 
for  which  the  etiological  factors  have  been  revealed  by 
recent  progress  in  genome-wide  association  studies 
(GWAS).  More  than  20  genetic  loci  have  been  identified 
as  being  associated  with  the  risk  of  T2DM,  and  this 
finding  has  been  replicated  across  different  ethnic  po-
pulations.  Many  of  the  loci  are  involved  in  pancreatic  β- 
cell  function,  suggesting  the  technical  validity  of  GWAS 
and  predominant  contribution  of  these  loci  to  T2DM 
(Prokopenko  et al.,  2008).  However,  given  the  genetic 
heterogeneity  of  the  disease,  hypothesis-based  candi-
date  gene  approaches  have  been  successfully  applied 
along  with  GWAS  to  identify  additional  loci  that  are 
moderately  associated  with  T2DM.
    Among  the  candidates,  genes  involved  in  inflamma-
tion  have  been  intensively  studied,  with  most  studies 
examining  the  role  of  subclinical  chronic  inflammation  in 
the  development  of 
resistance  and  T2DM 
(Shoelson et al.,  2007).  It  is  known  that  chronic  over-nu-
trition  results  in  local  inflammation  in  adipose  tissue, 
mediated  by  macrophage  infiltration  and  increased  pro-
duction  of  pro-inflammatory  mediators,  the  occurrence 
of  which  potentiates  insulin  resistance  (Weisberg et al., 
2003).  Consistently,  genetic  variants  in  pro-inflammatory 
markers  and  cytokines  have  been  tested  in  many  stud-
ies,  supported  by  clinical  observation  including  elevated 
levels  of  tumor  necrosis  factor-α (TNF-α),  C-reactive 
protein  (CRP)  and  interleukin-6  (IL6)  in  patients  with 
obesity-related  insulin  resistance  (Genco  et al.,  2005; 
Plomgaard  et al.,  2005;  Pradhan  et al.,  2001). 
    Based  on  the  identification  of  homeostatic  regulatory 
mechanisms  in  the  inflammatory  system  that  involve 
both  pro-  and  anti-inflammatory  cytokines,  it  has  been 
proposed  that  anti-inflammatory  cytokines,  such  as  in-
sulin-like  growth  factor-1  (IGF-1),  IL10,  IL13  and  IL4, 
play  a  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  insulin  resistance  and 
T2DM.  However,  the  underlying  mechanism  of  their  dis-
rupted  functions  in  chronic  inflammation  in  relation  to 
T2DM  remains  to  be  defined.  Interestingly,  there  has 
been  a  report  showing  disruption  of  anti-inflammatory 
responses  in  type  2  diabetic  model  animals,  suggesting 
a 
in  T2DM 
(O'Connor  et al.,  2007).

role  of  anti-inflammatory  processes 

    To  investigate  the  implication  of  anti-inflammatory  cy-
tokines  in  the  development  of  T2DM,  we  conducted 
case-control  association  studies  to  examine  the  correla-
tion  between  disease  risk  and  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNP)  in  the  relevant  genetic  loci  including 
IL4  and  the  IL4  receptor-coding  gene, IL4RA,  which  ex-
press  an  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  and  its  receptor  that 
play  a  key  role  in  directing  macrophages  to  an  'alterna-
tively  activated'  state  that  is  characterized  by  low  ex-
pression  patterns  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  and 
high 
(Gordon, 
2003).  Our  findings  indicate  that  a  promoter  variant  of 
an  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  IL4  gene  is  associated 
with  risk  of  T2DM  in  the  Korean  population,  which,  we 
believe,  lends  significant  insight  into  the  role  of  anti-in-
flammatory  cytokines  in  the  T2DM  etiology.

Methods

Subjects

Study  subjects  for  SNP  discovery  and  the  first  and  sec-
ond  stages  of  association  analyses  were  recruited  from 
two  community-based  cohorts  established  as  part  of  the 
Korean  Genome  and  Epidemiology  Study  (KoGES)  con-
ducted  by  Korea  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Pre-
vention  (KCDC).  The  Institutional  Review  Board  of  KCDC 
approved  the  study,  and  informed  consent  was  obtained 
from  every  subject  prior  to  enrollment.  The  case  sub-
jects  with  T2DM  were  selected  in  accordance  with  the 
1999  World  Health  Organization  criterion.  Control  sub-
jects  were  composed  of  individuals  with  no  history  of

plasma  glucose  level≤126  mg/dL  and  a  plasma  glu-
cose  level≤140  mg/dL  120  min  after  glucose  ingestion. 
The  parameters  measured  were  height,  weight,  waist 
and  hip  circumference  and  blood  pressure.  Body  mass 
index  (BMI)  was  calculated  by  dividing  weight  (kg)  by 
height  squared  (m2).  Waist-to-hip  ratio  (WHR)  was  calcu-
lated  from  these  measurements.  Blood  samples  were 
collected  at  three  separate  times  (0,  60,  120  min)  from 
the  cohort  participants  who  were  subjected  to  oral  glu-
cose  tolerance  tests  (OGTT)  and  analyzed  for  glucose 
and  insulin  concentration  at  the  given  time.  Cholesterol, 
triglyceride,  and  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholester-
ol  were  measured  at  baseline.  Low-density  lipoprotein 
(LDL)  cholesterol  level  was  calculated  using  the  Frie-
dewald  formula  for  subjects  with  a  triglyceride  level  less 
than  400  mg/dL  (LDL=total  cholesterol－(triglyceride/ 
5+HDL)).  Clinical  parameters  of  the  study  subjects  are 
summarized  in  Table  1.   

Sequencing  and  genotyping

To  identify  SNPs  of IL4  and IL4RA,  we  sequenced  entire 
exons  of  the  genes  including  the  coding  and  the  5’-  and 
3’-untranslated  regions  (up  to  approximately  2  kb  up-
stream  of  the  start  codon  and  0.5  kb  downstream  of  the 
stop  codon)  as  well  as  exon-intron  boundary  regions  us-
ing  genomic  DNA  samples  collected  from  24  unrelated 
Korean  subjects.  The  ABI  PRISM  3730  DNA  analyzer 
(Applied  BiosystemsTM)  was  used  for  sequencing  and 
the  primer  sequences  were  designed  based  on 
GenBank  sequences  (NG_023252.1  for  IL4  and  NG_

012086  for  IL4RA).  SNPs  with  a  minor  allele  frequency
≥0.02  and  a  pair-wise r2  coefficient≥0.8  were  selected 
further  genotyping.  The  VeraCode  GoldenGate 
for

  (Life  technologies)  genotyp-
(Illumina,  Inc.)  or  TaqMan
ing  assay  was  employed  using  genomic  DNA  samples 
extracted  from  blood  of  study  subjects.  Genotypes  with 
concordance  rates≥99%  and  call  rates≥98%  were  on-
ly  included  for  association  analyses.

Statistical  analysis

Deviation  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  was 
tested  using  the  χ2  test.  We  examined  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  between  all  pairs  of  biallelic  loci  using 
Lewontin’s  D’  (|D’|)  and  r2  coefficients,  widely  used 
measures  for  LD  analysis.  Haplotypes  of  each  individual 
were  inferred  using  HaploView  (Barrett  et al.,  2005). 
Logistic  regression  analyses  were  conducted  to  de-
termine  the  odds  ratio  (OR)  (95%  confidence  interval 
(CI))  for  the  risk  of  T2DM,  controlling  for  the  covariates 
of  age,  sex,  and  BMI.  Multivariate  linear  regression  anal-
yses  were  performed  to  test  for  associations  among 
T2DM-related  intermediate  phenotypes  such  as  BMI,  se-
rum  glucose  and  insulin  level  among  the  unaffected 
group,  controlling  for  age  and  sex.  Statistical  analyses 
were  performed  using  SAS  (SAS  institute).  The  inverse- 
variance  meta-analysis  method  was  employed  for  com-
bined  analysis  of  the  two-stage  association  study,  as-
suming  fixed  effects.  The  R  program  (version  2.7.1)  was 
used  for  the  analysis.  Heterogeneity  was  verified  using 
Cochran’s  Q  test.  Gene-gene  interaction  between  the 
IL4  and IL4RA  SNPs  was  analyzed  using  the  logistic  re-
gression  method.  A  combination  of  the  homozygous  ge-
notype  of  the  major  allele  of  both  genes  (TT  for 
rs2243250T＞C  and  CC  for  rs3024610C＞T)  was  used 
as  a  reference  of  epistasis.  Correction  for  multiple  test-
ing  was  conducted  following  the  false  discovery  rate 
(FDR)-controlling  methods  of  Benjamini  and  Hochberg. 
The  transcription  factor  binding  of  the  SNP-containing 
region  was  analyzed  using  FASTSNP  (http://fastsnp.ibms. 
sinica.edu.tw/pages/input_CandidateGeneSearch.jsp).

Reporter  gene  plasmid  construction  and  expres-
sion  assay

    The  genomic  region  (－433  to  +353  with  respect  to 
the  transcription  initiation  site  of  NM_000589  as  +1)  of 
IL4  was  amplified  using  standard  PCR  methods.  DNA 
samples  extracted  from rs2243250T  or rs2243250C car-
riers  were  used  as  a  template  for  PCR.  Sequences  of 
the  oligonucleotide  primers  used  for  amplification  are  as 
follows:  5'  to  3'  primer,  CCTGATCACAACATTGCATTT-
CAGC;  3'  to  5'  primer,  CAGTGACAATGTGAGGCAATT-

AGTTTATC.  Each  PCR  product  was  thoroughly  se-
quenced  prior  to  insertion  into  the  upstream  region  of 
the  bla  (M)  reporter  gene,  coding  for  β-lactamase 
(GeneBLAzerTM,  Invitrogen),  to  ensure  the  SNP  sequence 
and  the  proper  sequence  identity  of  the  constructs  ex-
cept  for  the  SNP  of  interest.  Plasmid  DNA  of  the  re-
porter  constructs  was  prepared  for  transfection  using  an 
endotoxin-free  DNA  preparation  kit  (Qiagen).  For  trans-
fection,  cells  of  the  human  hepatocellular  carcinoma  cell 
line  SNU398  or  the  human  adipocyte  cell  line  SW872  (3 
×104  per  well)  were  plated  in  a  black-walled  96-well  tis-
sue-culture  plate  with  a  clear  bottom  (Costar).  After  a  24 
hr-incubation  period,  the  cells  were  transfected  with  400 
ng  of  purified  reporter  plasmid  DNA  using  Lipofect-
amine  2000  transfection  reagent  (Invitrogen).  The  re-
porter  β-lactamase  activity  was  quantitatively  measured 
from  the  transiently  transfected  cells  after  48  hrs  of  in-
cubation  at  37oC,  5%  CO2,  following  the  manufacturer's 
instructions  (Invitrogen,  GeneBLAzerTM  in vivo detection 
kit).  The  normalized  activity  was  presented  as  a  relative 
ratio  with  respect  to  that  of  cells  transfected  without 
DNA.

Results

Association of an IL4  polymorphism with  the  risk 
of  T2DM

To  explore  the  possibility  that IL4  and IL4RA  are  asso-
ciated  with  the  risk  of  T2DM,  we  first  attempted  to  iden-
tify  SNPs  in  the  Korean  population  by  sequencing  the 
gene  loci  including  5’-  and  3’-flanking  regions.  Among 
the  identified  SNPs  (Supplementary  Fig.  and  Supple-
mentary  Tables  1-1  and  1-2),  we  selected  two  and  eight 
SNPs  from  the IL4  and IL4RA  loci,  respectively,  consid-
ering  LD  and  allele  frequencies  for  large-scale  geno-
typing.  We  genotyped  474  unrelated  T2DM  cases  and 
470  non-diabetic  control  subjects  to  test  for  association 
of  the  polymorphisms  with  host  susceptibility  to  the 
disease.  The  subjects  were  recruited  from  Ansan  and 
Ansung  community-based  cohorts  as  part  of  KoGES 
(Table  1). 
    In  the  case-control  study  using  logistic  regression 
analysis  with  adjustment  for  age,  sex,  and  BMI,  we 
found  no  differences  in  the  distribution  of  genotype  fre-
quencies  between  the  control  and  T2DM  cases  for  any 
of  the  SNPs  tested,  with  exception  of  a  promoter  variant 
on  the IL4  locus, rs2243250T＞C.  The  analysis  revealed 
that  the  minor  allele  C  had  a  protective  effect  on  T2DM 
risk  compared  to  that  of  the  major  allele  T  (protective 
allele  OR=0.70;  95%  CI,  0.55∼0.89;  p=0.004  (FDR-P  ＜ 
0.05)  in  an  additive  model,  Table  2). 
    To  confirm  these  results,  we  conducted  a  second

stage  case-control  association  analysis  by  genotyping 
samples  from  another  community-based  cohort,  Health 
2  of  KoGES.  The  genotyping  of  1,216  cases  and  1,352 
controls  generated  additional  evidence  supporting  the 
association  of  rs2243250T＞C  with  T2DM  (OR=0.80; 
95%  CI,  0.67∼0.94;  p=0.007  (FDR-P＜0.05)).  A  meta- 
analysis  of  the  data  of  the  two  cohorts  produced  stron-
ger  combined  evidence  of  association  (OR=0.77;  95% 
CI,  0.67∼0.88;  p=1.65×10-4  (FDR-P＜0.05);  Table  2).

Effect  of  IL4-IL4RA  gene-gene  interaction  on 
T2DM  risk

Although  our  analyses  of  individual  SNPs  or  haplotypes 
revealed  no  evidence  of  IL4RA  association  with  T2DM, 
the  linear  regression  analyses  for  T2DM-related  inter-
mediate  phenotypes  such  as  BMI,  WHR,  plasma  glu-
cose  and  insulin  level  in  the  controls  showed  modest 
association  signals  of  IL4RA  polymorphisms  with  BMI 
and  insulin  level  in  either  or  both  populations  (Supple-
mentary  Table  2).  This  result  led  us  to  examine  the  ef-
fect  of  IL4-IL4RA  interaction  on  disease  susceptibility. 

Logistic  analysis  for  epistasis  between  rs2243250T＞C 
of IL4  and  the  tagging  SNPs  of IL4RA  (Table  2)  showed 
existence  of  an  interaction  between  the  IL4  SNPs  and 
an  intronic  SNP, rs3024610C＞T (Table  3).  The  hetero-
zygous  genotype  for  rs2243250T＞C  (TC)  and  the  ho-
mozygous  genotype  for  rs3024610C＞T  (CC)  showed 
significant  association  with  a  protective  effect  in  the  first 
stage,  compared  to  the  TT×CC  as  a  reference  (OR= 
0.40;  95%  CI,  0.22∼0.73;  p=0.003).  In  the  second 
stage  analysis,  a  combination  of  the  heterozygous  geno-
types  for  both  SNPs  (TC×CT)  displayed  a  moderate  as-
sociation  in  the  same  direction  (OR=0.72;  95%  CI, 
0.5333∼0.98;  p=0.034).  Although  the  same  combination 
of  genotypes  was  not  replicated,  these  results  suggest 
that  interaction  of IL4  and IL4RA  has  a  cumulative  effect 
on  T2DM  risk,  compared  to  the  effects  from  the  in-
dividual  SNPs.

Functional association of an IL4 promoter variant 
with  the  gene  expression

The  strong  association  of  rs2243250T＞C  with  T2DM 

118    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(3)  114-120,  September  2011

and  its  close  proximity  to  the IL4  transcription  initiation 
site  (－219  bp  with  respect  to  +1)  led  us  to  investigate 
the  effect  of  this  polymorphism  on IL4  promoter  activity. 
Results  from  searches  for  transcription  factor  binding 
sites  (TFBS)  suggested  that rs2243250  C  allele  to  T  al-
lele  alteration  would  generate  a  SOX5  (SRY  (sex  de-
termining  region  Y)  box  5)  binding  site  in  the  proximal 
promoter  region  of  the  gene.    To  this  end,  we  prepared 
reporter  gene  constructs  carrying  β-lactamase-coding

sequences  whose  expression  was  controlled  by  the IL4 
promoter  region.  These  reporter  constructs  were  then 
used  for  transfection  of  cells  to  measure  reporter  gene 
expression.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  the  cells  transiently  ex-
pressing  the  T  allele-carrying  reporter  gene  showed 
greater  reporter  activity  than  those  with  the  C  allele-car-
rying  construct,  which  was  consistent  with  the  TFBS 
prediction  results.  The  allelic  differential  expression  was 
consistently  observed  in  two  different  cell  lines,  SW872, 
a  human  adipocyte  cell  line  and  SNU398,  a  human  hep-
atocellular  carcinoma  cell  line,  which  excluded  the  pos-
sibility  of  cell  line-specific  indirect  effects.  This  result 
suggests  that  the  IL4  promoter  variant  rs2243250T＞C 
might  affect  the  gene  expression  level  by  modulating 
promoter  activity  in  the  SNP-containing  region.

Discussion

There  is  accumulating  evidence  indicating  a  critical  role 
for  sub-acute  chronic  inflammation  in  the  pathogenesis 
of  obesity-related  insulin  resistance  and  T2DM  (Corvera 
et al.,  2006;  Dandona et al.,  2004;  Dandona et al.,  2005; 
Finegood,  2003;  Genco  et al.,  2005;  Mangge  et al., 
2004;  Meerarani et al.,  2007;  WangCai,  2006;  Weisberg 
et al.,  2003).  In  obesity,  adipose  tissues  were  shown  to 
be  infiltrated  by  macrophages,  which  may  be  a  major 
source  of  locally-produced  pro-inflammatory  cytokines 
(Weisberg  et al.,  2003).  Increased  levels  of  TNFα and 
IL6  were  shown  to  correlate  with  reduced  insulin-  stimu-
lated  glucose  uptake  in  obese  and  T2DM  patients 
(Bastard  et al.,  2006;  Katsuki  et al.,  1998;  Kern  et al., 
2001;  Mishima  et al.,  2001).
    As  a  homeostatic  mechanism  in  the  immune-inflam-
matory  system,  anti-inflammatory  agents  including  IGF- 
1,  IL10,  IL13  and  IL4  reduce  secretion  of  pro-inflam-
matory  cytokines  by  macrophages  and  stimulate  the 
production  of  various  anti-inflammatory  molecules  (Orino 
et al.,  1992;  Sone  et al.,  1992;  Vannier  et al.,  1992). 
Several  reports  have  demonstrated  that  suppression  of 
inflammation  by  the  anti-inflammatory  cytokines  is  im-
paired  in  T2DM  patients  (O'Connor et al.,  2007).  Insulin 
resistance  due  to  obesity-related  chronic  inflammation 
has  been  suggested  as  an  underlying  mechanism  linking 
anti-inflammatory  cytokine  dysfunction  to  T2DM  (Shoel-
son  et al.,  2007).
  IL4,  an  anti-inflammatory  cytokine,  is  known  to  direct 
macrophages  toward  an  'alternatively  activated'  state 
that  is  characterized  by  low  expression  patterns  of  pro- 
inflammatory  cytokines  and  high  levels  of  anti-inflam-
matory  cytokines  (Gordon,  2003).  Although  its  detailed 
mechanism  is  not  as  well  defined  as  that  of  pro-in-
flammatory  cytokines,  IL4  has  received  much  attention 
for  its  potential  relationship  to  insulin  resistance  and 

T2DM,  as  supported  by  an  observation  showing  that 
there  is  an  IL4-dependent  insulin  signaling  pathway  in 
macrophages,  and  the  positive  regulatory  functions  for 
other  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  production  mechanisms 
were  impaired  in db/db  diabetic  model  mice  (Hartman et 
al.,  2004;  O'Connor  et al.,  2007).  Moreover,  a  recent 
study  clearly  demonstrated  that  knock-out  mice  de-
fective  in  the  IL4-stimulated  alternative  activation  of 
macrophage  were  more  susceptible  to  obesity  and  in-
sulin  resistance  than  were  control  mice  (Odegaard et al., 
2007). 
    These  previous  results  prompted  us  to  investigate 
whether  genetic  polymorphisms  of  the  IL4  and  IL4  re-
ceptor-coding  genes  would  modulate  host  susceptibility 
to  T2DM.  Although  there  have  been  several  reports  con-
troversially  linking  IL4  and  IL4R  polymorphisms  to  risk 
for  autoimmune  T1DM  in  various  ethnic  backgrounds, 
there  have  been  no  reports  such  an  association  with 
T2DM  (Bugawan et al.,  2003;  Maier et al.,  2005;  Nunez 
et al.,  2008;  Reimsnider et al.,  2000).  In  this  report,  we 
present  results  from  two-stage  case-control  association 
and  functional  analyses  showing  that  a  SNP  located  in 
the  IL4  promoter  region,  rs2243250T＞C,  is  associated 
with  the  risk  of  T2DM.  Although  we  found  no  associa-
tion  of  any  of  the  common  IL4RA  SNP  with  disease 
susceptibility  in  our  study  population,  we  observed  as-
sociation  between  intronic  variants  of  IL4RA  and  obe-
sity-related  BMI  and 
level.  Moreover,  our 
gene-gene-interaction  analyses  implied  that  this  func-
tional IL4  promoter  SNP  could  modify  disease  suscepti-
bility  in  combination  with  the  intronic  SNP  in  the IL4RA 
gene.
    Our  reporter  gene  expression  assay  indicates  that 
rs2243250T＞C  may  affect  the  overall IL4  promoter  ac-
tivity  modulating  the  gene  expression  level.  The  minor  C 
allele,  which  is  associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of 
T2DM,  was  shown  to  lower  the  expression  level.  This 
functional  consequence  of  the  protective  allele  reducing 
IL4  expression  was  unexpected,  given  the  previous  re-
ports  showing  links  between  impaired  IL4  function  in  di-
abetic  model  animals  and  obesity  and  insulin  resistance 
(Hartman et al.,  2004;  O'Connor et al.,  2007).  A  possible 
explanation  for  our  result  is  the  presence  of  other  inter-
acting  genetic  and/or  environmental  effects  involved  in 
IL4  function,  other  than  the  expression  level  itself.  It 
could  include  additional  mechanisms  by  which  incre-
ased  expression  levels  of  IL4  receptor  coding  gene 
and/or  other  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  genes  would 
compensate  for  the  decreased  IL4  expression  level.   
Additional  in-depth  functional  and  physiological  studies 
will  be  needed  to  establish  the  mechanism  of  this 
association.
    On  the  basis  of  our  findings,  as  well  as  the  functional 

insulin

data  of  other  groups,  we  propose  that  the  genetic  poly-
morphisms  of  an  anti-inflammatory  cytokine  coding  IL4 
and  IL4RA  may  modify  an  individual's  susceptibility  to 
T2DM.  Despite  the  recent  success  of  GWAS  in  identify-
ing  T2DM  susceptibility  loci,  our  findings  have  shown 
that  a  hypothesis-based  candidate  gene  approach  which 
complements  GWAS  is  still  a  powerful  way  to  identify 
unknown  disease-associated  loci.  We  believe  our  find-
ings  contribute  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  disease 
etiology  and  may  help  to  identify  unknown  genes  in  the 
relevant  pathways  or  mechanism.
