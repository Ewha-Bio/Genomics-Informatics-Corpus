Osteosarcoma  is  the  most  common  primary  bone  tumor,  generally  affecting  young  people.  While  the  etiology  of 
osteosarcoma has been largely unknown, recent studies have suggested that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a critical role in 
the proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. To understand the mechanism of action of COX-2 in the 
pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, we compared gene expression patterns between three stable COX-2-overexpressing cell lines 
and three control cell lines derived from U2OS human osteosarcoma cells. The data showed that 56 genes were upregulated, 

whereas 20 genes were downregulated, in COX-2-overexpressed cell lines, with an average fold-change ＞ 1.5. Among the 

upregulated  genes,  COL1A1,  COL5A2,  FBN1,  HOXD10,  RUNX2,  and  TRAPPC2  are  involved  in  bone  and  skeletal  system 
development, while DDR2, RAC2, RUNX2, and TSPAN31 are involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation. Among 
the downregulated genes, HIST1H1D, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H3H, and HIST1H4C are involved in nucleosome assembly and DNA 
packaging. These results may provide useful information to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the COX-2-mediated 
malignant phenotype in osteosarcoma.

Introduction

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, 
representing over 56% of all bone tumors. It generally affects 
young people with the age of 15 to 19 and usually occurs in 
long bones near the metaphyseal growth plates. It has a high 
tendency  to  metastasize,  and  about  10%–20%  of  patients 
have  macroscopic  evidence  of  metastasis  at  the  time  of 
diagnosis, while 80%–90% of patients are assumed to have 
micrometastasis. Although it has been postulated that rapid 
bone  growth,  exposure  to  radiation,  and  genetic  predis-
positions, such as RB or p53 mutations, are thought to be risk 
factors for developing osteosarcoma, the etiology has not 
been fully understood [1-3]. 

Prostaglandin  endoperoxide  synthase  2  (PTGS2),  also 

called as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), catalyzes the convert-
sion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, from which 
various  prostanoids,  including  prostaglandin  E2,  are  pro-
duced [4].

Accumulating evidence indicates that COX-2 is involved 
in  osteosarcoma  development  and  progression.  Several 
studies have reported that high levels of COX-2 expression is 
associated with advanced clinical stage and metastasis [5, 6], 
as well as with lower overall survival rates and disease-free 
survival rates [7-9]. In addition, COX-2 inhibition by using 
RNAi or antisense oligonucleotide inhibits cell proliferation 
and invasion in human osteosarcoma cells [10, 11]. Also, 
selective  COX-2  inhibitors  reduce  not  only  osteosarcoma 
cell proliferation and invasion in vitro but also tumor growth 
and  metastasis  in  vivo  [12,  13].  Moreover,  we  have  pre-
viously reported that COX-2 overexpression promotes cell

proliferation,  migration,  and  invasion  in  U2OS  human 
osteosarcoma cells [14]. These studies strongly suggest that 
COX-2 might be a causal factor for the development and 
progression  of  osteosarcoma.  However,  the  exact  mecha-
nisms  of  action  of  COX-2  in  osteosarcoma  are  largely 
unknown.

In an attempt to figure out the mechanism of action of 
COX-2 in osteosarcoma, we analyzed the gene expression 
profiles  in  three  COX-2-overexpressed  U2OS  stable  cell 
lines and three control stable cell lines.

After purification, 750 ng of labeled cRNA was hybridized to 
the humanHT-12 expression v.4 bead array (Illumina, San 
Diego, CA, USA) for 16-18 h at 58°C. The array signal was 
detected using Amersham fluorolink streptavidin-Cy3 (GE 
Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). Arrays were 
scanned  with  an  Illumina  bead  array  reader/confocal 
scanner. Array data were filtered by a detection p-value ＜ 
0.05 (similar to signal to noise). Selected gene signal values 
were  log-transformed  and  normalized  by  the  quantile 
method.

Methods
Establishment and maintenance of stable cell lines

Human COX-2 cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 
vector containing neor. U2OS cells  were  transfected with 
COX-2  or  pcDNA3  DNA  using  Lipofectamine2000  (Life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Transfectants were 
selected in the presence of geneticin, and individual clones 
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 
containing  fetal  bovine  serum  (10%),  penicillin  (100 
units/mL),  streptomycin  (100  units/mL),  and  geneticin 
(700 μg/mL), as reported previously [14].

RNA isolation

Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  cells  with  Trizol  (Life 
Technologies), purified with the addition of chloroform, and 
precipitated  with  the  addition  of  isopropanol.  The  RNA 
concentration was determined by a spectrophotometer, and 
the quality of RNA was evaluated by the OD 260/280 ratio 
and gel electrophoresis.

Hybridization to expression arrays

The following procedures were carried out by Macrogen 
Co.  (Seoul,  Korea).  First,  total  RNA  was  amplified  and 
purified using the Ambion Illumina RNA amplification kit to 
yield biotinylated cRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Briefly, 
550 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using 
a  T7  oligo(dT)  primer.  Second-strand  cDNA  was  synthe-
sized,  in  vitro-transcribed,  and  labeled  with  biotin-NTP. 

Table  1.  Summary  of  stable  cell  line  characteristics 

Statistical analysis

Basic statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft 
Excel.  Hierarchical  cluster  analysis  was  conducted  with 
normalized log2-gene expression values using Cluster 3.0, 
and the results were visualized using Java Treeview [15, 16]. 
An  unrooted  tree  was  drawn  with  R  package.  Biological 
function analysis was performed with official gene names 
using DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).

Results
Stable cell lines

We  have  previously  established  stable  cell  lines  over-
expressing  human  COX-2  in  U2OS  human  osteosarcoma 
cells. To avoid clonal variations, we established three stable 
COX-2-overexpressing cell lines (U2OS-COX-2 #1, #2, and 
#3) and three control cell lines (U2OS-pcDNA3 #1, #2, and 
#3).  High  levels  of  COX-2  expression  were  observed  by 
western  blot  analysis  in  U2OS-COX-2  cells,  whereas  the 
expression  was  barely  detectable  in  U2OS-pcDNA3  cells. 
When we cultured the stable cell lines, we observed that cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion rates were increased 
significantly  in  U2OS-COX-2  cells  as  compared  with 
U2OS-pcDNA3 cells [14] (Table 1).

Gene expression

We first performed unsupervised cluster analysis compa-
ring COX-2-overexpressing cell lines and control cell lines. 
Among  24,371  probe  sets,  we  selected  and  analyzed  567

probe sets with a standard deviation ＞ 0.5. The group of 
U2OS-COX-2 (U2OS-COX-2 #1, #2, and #3) and the group 
of  U2OS-pcDNA3  (U2OS-pcDNA3  #1,  #2,  and  #3)  were 
well segregated in the unsupervised cluster analysis, con-
firming that our experiment was validated (Fig. 1).

To  identify  significantly  differentially  expressed  genes 
(DEGs)  in  COX-2-overexpressing  osteosarcoma  cells,  we 
first  performed  the  Wilcoxon  rank  sum  test  between  the 
group  of  U2OS-COX-2  and  the  group  of  U2OS-pcDNA3. 
The 2,144 probe sets passed the criteria. Then, to identify 
DEGs, we selected 76 probe sets with an average fold-change 
＞ 1.5.

Among the DEGs, 56 genes were upregulated while 20 
genes were downregulated in the group of U2OS-COX-2 as 
compared to the group of U2OS-pcDNA3 (Tables 2 and 3). 
The  heat  map  of  DEGs  is  provided  in  Fig.  2.  The  gene 
encoding COX-2, PTGS2, was upregulated by 10.41-fold in 
the  COX-2-overexpressing  cell  lines  as  compared  to  the 
control cell lines, confirming again that our experiment is

COX-2 overexpression in U2OS cells were skeletal system 
development  and  morphogenesis,  bone  development  and 
morphogenesis, ossification, and positive regulation of cell 
proliferation (p ＜ 0.05) (Table 4). The genes of COL1A1, 
COL5A2, FBN1, HOXD10, RUNX2, and TRAPPC2 are involved 
in  skeletal  system  development  and  morphogenesis.  The 
genes of COL1A1, COL5A2, and RUNX2 are involved in bone 
development, morphogenesis and ossification. The genes of 
DDR2,  RAC2,  RUNX2,  and  TSPAN31  are  involved  in  the 
positive regulation of cell proliferation (Table 4).

The functions that were most significantly downregulated 
by COX-2 overexpression in U2OS cells were nucleosome 
assembly, chromatin assembly, and DNA packaging (p  ＜ 
0.05). The genes of HIST1H1D, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H3H, and 
HIST1H4C are involved in these processes (Table 5).

Discussion

COX-2 has been reported to promote cell proliferation, 
migration, and invasion in osteosarcoma cells. COX-2 gene 
knockdown  by  RNAi  significantly  reduced  the  cell  proli-
feration,  migration,  and  invasion  in  SaOS2  cells  [11], 
whereas stable expression of COX-2 increased the ability in 
U2OS cells [14] (Table 1). These studies demonstrated that 
abnormal  COX-2  overexpression  is  an  important  deter-
minant for the malignant phenotype of osteosarcoma cells. 
By  using  bioinformatics  tools,  we  here  provided  useful 
information  to  understand  the  underlying  mechanism  by 
which COX-2 promotes the malignant phenotype in osteo-
sarcoma cells.

According to our data, the genes encoding extracellular 
matrix proteins are highly upregulated by COX-2 (Tables 2 
and 4). The genes COL1A1, COL5A2, and FBN1 encode α1 
chain of type I collagen, α2 chain of type V collagen, and 
fibrillin 1, respectively. It has been known that the type I and 
type V collagens are major extracellular matrix proteins in

bone [17]. Although there is a report that type I collagen 
promotes cell proliferation and migration in gastric cancer 
cells  [18],  the  causal  relationship  between  the  overex-
pression  of  those  genes  and  osteosarcoma  has  not  been 
investigated well. Therefore, further studies are necessary to 
elucidate whether overexpression of these genes might be 
involved  in  the  COX-2-mediated  malignant  phenotype  in 
osteosarcoma.

Extracellular matrix proteins not only are structural com-
ponents of the connective tissue in the body but also regulate 
cell fates through their receptors on the cell surface. DDR2 
is one of the receptors for collagen, the expression of which 
was highly upregulated by COX-2 (Tables 2 and 4). DDR2 is 
a receptor tyrosine kinase, and its overexpression promotes 
the  migration  and  invasion  of  cancer  cells  derived  from 
breast,  head  and  neck,  and  prostate  [19-21].  Therefore, 
COX-2  might  promote  cell  proliferation  and  motility 
through upregulation of DDR2. Further studies are nece-
ssary to elucidate this possibility.

RAC2, a highly upregulated gene by COX-2, is a member 
of the Rho family of GTPases (Tables 2 and 4). Although 
there is no report on Rac2 function in osteosarcoma, there is 
a report that Rac2 GTPase is required for B cell proliferation 
and  survival  [22].  Therefore,  COX-2  might  promote  cell 
proliferation through upregulation of Rac2 function.

Among the highly upregulated genes, RUNX2 encodes a 
transcription factor governing osteoblast differentiation and 
skeletal morphogenesis. Recent studies on Runx2 function 
in cancer are controversial. Runx2 overexpression reduces 
cell  proliferation  in  osteosarcoma  cell  lines  [23]  but 
promotes cell motility or invasion in MCF-7 breast cancer 
cells and PC prostate cancer cells [24, 25]. Therefore, further 

studies are required to elucidate the function of Runx2 in 
osteosarcoma and the relation between COX-2 and Runx2.
Intriguingly,  the  genes  encoding  histone  proteins  are 
highly downregulated by COX-2 (Tables 3 and 5). The genes 
HIST1H1D, HIST1H2AI, HIST1H3H, and HIST1H4C encode 
histone H1H1, histone H2A1, histone H3A1, and histone 
H41, respectively. As is well known, the nucleosome is the 
basic unit of DNA packaging, consisting of a core particle and 
linker DNA. A core particle comprises 147 base pairs of DNA 
wrapped around a histone octamer (2 copies each of histone 
H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The core particles are connected by 
10–90 bp of linker DNA, which could be naked or bound to 
histone H1 [26]. The nucleosome itself has been known to 
be  a  general  gene  repressor  [27,  28].  In  addition,  RNAi- 
mediated knockdown of H2A.Z reduced cell proliferation in 
bladder cancer cells [29]. These results are compatible with 
our  finding  that  COX-2  downregulates  the  expression  of 
histone genes. Therefore, it is worth studying the mecha-
nism  of  action  of  histones  in  osteosarcoma  and  the 
mechanism by which COX-2 downregulates histone genes.
Osteosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor, and the 5-year 
survival rate is only 20%–30% in patients with macroscopic 
evidence of metastasis at diagnosis [3]. While the etiology of 
osteosarcoma has been largely unknown, recent studies have 
suggested that COX-2 plays a critical role in osteosarcoma 
development and progression. In this regard, we believe that 
our study will provide useful information to understand the 
mechanism of action of COX-2 in osteosarcoma.
