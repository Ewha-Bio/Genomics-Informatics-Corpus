In this issue, Drs. Sun Ho Lee and Wung Joo Song report 
copy  number  variations  in  42  Korean  patients  with 
unexplained  developmental  disorders  by  chromosomal 
microarray  (no  chromosomal  alteration  was  detected  by 
conventional  karyotyping  or  fluorescent  in  situ  hybridi-
zation). They found clinically relevant copy number varia-
tions  in  over  60%  of  tested  patients,  which  suggests  the 
superior  diagnostic  performance  of  chromosomal  micro-
array analysis. Dr. Sun-Young Kong’s group observed chro-
mothripsis events in several myeloma cell lines and bone 
marrow samples of multiple myeloma patients. They found 
that  the  number  of  chromothripsis-like  events  increased 

after  drug  treatment  and  that  chromothripsis-like  events 
were  more  frequent  in  the  drug-resistant  group.  Dr. 
Heui-Soo  Kim’s  group  explored  the  evolutionary  conser-
vation of miR-21-3p in various species and the expression 
patterns of target genes in olive flounder. In the application 
note section, Dr. Buhm Han’s group report an interesting 
tool,  called  ‘MergeReference.’  This  tool  supports  the 
imputation of human leukocyte antigen genes using inter-
genic single nucleotide polymorphism markers.
