Abstract

Human  leucine-rich  alpha-2-glycoprotein  1  (LRG1)  was 
first  identified  as  a  trace  protein  in  human  serum.  The 
primary  sequence  of  LRG1  includes  repeated  leucine 
residues  and  putative  membrane-binding  domains.  But, 
there  is  no  published  information  on  the  genetic  varia-
tion  of  this  gene.  In  this  study, LRG1  was  identified  as 
one  of  several  upregulated  genes  in  RA  patients.  We 
examined  the  expression  levels  of LRG1  between  an  RA 
patient  and  a  healthy  control  by  RT-PCR  and  validated 
that  LRG1  was  highly  expressed  in  RA  patients  com-
pared  with  controls.  We  identified  the  possible  variation 
sites  and  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  the 
human  LRG1  gene  by  direct  sequencing  and  analyzed 
the  association  of  genotype  and  allele  frequencies  be-
tween  RA  patients  and  a  control  group  without  RA.  We 
further  investigated  the  relationship  between  these  poly-
morphisms  and  the  level  of  RF  or  anti-CCP  in  RA 
patients.  We  identified  a  total  of  three  SNPs  (g.-678A＞
G,  g.-404C＞T  and  g.1427T＞C)  and  two  variation  sites 
(g.-1198delA  and  g.-893delA)  in  the LRG1  gene.  Our  re-
sults  suggest  that  polymorphisms  of  the LRG1  gene  are 
not  associated  with  the  susceptibility  of  RA  in  the 
Korean  population.

Introduction

RA  is  a  common  systemic  autoimmune  disease  that  is 
characterized  by  chronic  inflammation  of  the  synovium, 
which  can  lead  to  progressive  joint  destruction,  and  is 
a  complex  disease  that  is  a  combination  of  multiple  ge-
netic  factors  and  environmental  contributions  (Gregerin 
et al.,  1999).  RA  is  a  disease  that  has  a  prevalence  of 
0.3%  to  1%  worldwide.  RA  is  accompanied  by  the 
presence  of  many  autoantibodies,  such  as  rheumatoid 
factors  (RFs),  anti-cyclic  citrullinated  peptide  (anti-CCP) 
antibody,  and  antibodies  to  immunoglobulin  binding  pro-
tein  (BiP).  RFs  and  anti-CCP  antibody  are  used  in  clin-
ical  practice  (Blass et al.,  1999;  Schellekens et al.,  2000; 
Blass et al.,  2001).  RFs  were  the  first  described  human 
autoantibodies  and  are  directed  to  the  Fc  region  of  IgG 
and  are  usually  of  the  IgM  isotype  (Waaler et al.,  1940). 
They  are  detectable  in  up  to  10%  of  normal  individuals 
and  70%  to  80%  of  patients  with  RA,  and  anti-CCP  can 
be  detected  in  up  to  80%  of  patients  with  RA  (Tighe et 
al.,  2001).  The  RA  susceptibility  loci  were  identified,  in-
cluding  1p36,  5q31,  and  21q22,  by  whole-genome  link-
age  analysis  (genome-wide  association  studies),  and 
many  polymorphisms  also  have  been  identified  at  these 
loci  (Suzuki  et al.,  2003;  Tokuhiro  et al.,  2003). 
    Human  leucine-rich  alpha-2-glycoprotein  1  (LRG1) 
was  first  identified  as  a  trace  protein  in  human  serum 
(Haupt  &  Baudner,  1977).  The LRG1  gene  is  located  on 
chromosome  19p13.3,  and  the  primary  sequence  of 
LRG  includes  repeated  leucine  residues  and  also  has 
putative  membrane-binding  domains.  Serum  LRG1  is 
the  first  extracellular  ligand  for  cytochrome  c  (Cyt  c). 
Cyt c  is  a  ubiquitous,  heme-containing  protein  that  nor-
mally  resides  in  the  space  between  the  inner  and  outer 
(Newmeyer  et  al.,  2003). 
mitochondrial  membranes 
Extracellular  Cyt c  may  play  a  role  in  inflammation,  as 
it  has  been  reported  to  cause  arthritis  when  it  is  injected 
into  mice.  Its  levels  in  RA  patients'  sera  are  significantly 
lower  than  those  of  healthy  controls  (Pullerits  et al., 
2005).  At  least  eight  repeating  24-amino  acid  segments 
that  have  a  notable  consensus  sequence  were  identified 
in  a  large  family  of  LRG  proteins.  The  function  of  LRG 
has  not  been  elucidated,  although  the  functions  of  many 
of  the  other  members  of  the  LRR  (leucine-rich  re-
peat)-containing  superfamily  are  known 
(Kobe  & 
Deisenhofer,  1994;  Buchanan  &  Gay,  1996).  Plasma 
LRG  expression  levels  are  lower  in  liver  cancer  patients 
who  are  treated  with  radiofrequency  ablation  (Kawakami 

78    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  6(2)  77-83,  June  2008

et al.,  2005).  The  expression  levels  of  plasma  LRG  are 
high  in  idiopathic  normal  pressure  hydrocephalus  (INPH) 
and  lung  and  pancreatic  cancer  patients  (Kakisaka  et 
al.,  2007;  Li  et al.,  2007;  Okano  et al.,  2006).  Li  et al. 
reported  that  LRG  is  a  specific  biomarker  in  idiopathic 
normal  pressure  hydrocephalus  (Li et al.,  2006).  Genetic 
studies  of  LRG1  have  not  been  reported. 
    We  identified  several  candidate  genes  and  proteins 
for  RA  patients  by  DNA  microarray  and  2-D  gel  analysis 
between  RA  patients  and  healthy  controls  (unpublished 
data).  LRG1  was  identified  as  one  of  several  upregu-
lated  genes  in  RA  patients.  In  this  study,  we  identified 
the  possible  variation  sites  and  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNPs)  in  the  human  LRG1  gene  by  direct 
sequencing  of  genomic  DNA  that  was  isolated  from  48 
individuals  (24  non-RA  patients  and  24  RA  patients)  and 
analyzed  the  association  of  genotype  and  allele  frequen-
cies  between  RA  patients  and  a  control  group  without 
RA.  We  further  investigated  the  relationship  between 
these  polymorphisms  and  molecular  markers  (RF  levels 
and  anti-CCP)  in  RA  patients.

Methods

Subjects  and  DNA  samples

Blood  samples  and  records  were  obtained  from  520  RA 
patients  (102  males,  418  females)  and  567  controls  (355 
males,  212  females)  without  RA.  The  mean  age  of  RA 
patients  and  controls  was  53.2  years  and  40.3  years, 

respectively.  Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  leuko-
cytes  in  peripheral  blood  by  a  standard  phenol-chloro-
form  method  or  by  using  the  Invisorb  Spin  Blood  Maxi 
kit  (Invitek,  Germany)  according  to  the  manufacturer's 
instructions.  Patients  with  RA  were  recruited  from  the 
outpatient  clinic  at  Eulji  University  Hospital.  RA  was  di-
agnosed  according  to  criteria  set  forth  by  the  American 
Rheumatism  Association.  CRP  and  RF  levels  in  patients 
with  RA  were  determined  in  a  routine  laboratory  at  Eulji 
University  Hospital.  The  non-RA  controls  were  recruited 
from  the  general  population  and  had  received  compre-
hensive  medical 
testing  at  Wonkwang  University 
Hospital.  All  subjects  in  this  study  were  Korean.

Polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  and  DNA  se-
quencing

PCR  was  performed  using  50  ng  of  genomic  DNA,  Taq 
DNA  polymerase  (EF  Taq,  SolGent,  Korea),  and  0.5  μM 
of  each  primer  (Table  1)  under  the  following  conditions: 
30  cycles  of  PCR  consisting  of  denaturation  for  10  sec 
at  98oC,  annealing  for  30  sec  at  65oC,  extension  for  1 
min  at  72oC,  and  a  final  extension  for  10  min  at  72oC 
in  a  thermocycler  (Gene  Amp  PCR  system  9700,  PE 
Applied  Biosystems,  USA).  After  purification  using  a 
PCR  purification  kit  (Millipore,  Ireland),  the  PCR  prod-
ucts  were  used  as  template  DNA  for  sequencing  analy-
sis  (ABI  Prism  BigDye  Terminator  cycle  sequencing  sys-
tem;  ABI  3100  automatic  sequencer,  PE  Applied 
Biosystems,  USA).  For  sequencing,  the  same  PCR  pri-

formed  using  the  software  Rotor-Gene  1.7.40  and  the 
HRM  algorithm  that  was  provided.

RNA  extraction  and  RT-PCR

For  total  RNA,  human  peripheral  blood  mononuclear 
cells  (PBMC)  from  four  pairs  of  RA  patients  and  healthy 
controls  were  isolated  from  the  buffy  coats  by  density 
gradient  centrifugation  using  Ficoll-Paque  Plus  (Amer-
sham  Biosciences,  Sweden),  washed  with  phosphate- 
buffered  saline  (GIBCO  BRL,  Invitrogen,  USA),  and  lysed 
in  TRIzol  reagent  (Invitrogen,  USA)  according  to  the  in-
structions  of  the  manufacturer.  Approximately  1-2  μg  of 
total  RNA  was  used  in  the  first-strand  cDNA  synthesis 
with  a  sequence-specific  primer  using  M-MLV  reverse 
transcriptase  (Bioneer,  Korea)  for  RT-PCR.  The  ex-
pression  assay  for  several  tissues  was  performed  using 
multiple  human  tissue  cDNAs  (Clontech,  USA).

Genotype  analysis 

Genotyping  was  performed  by  high  resolution  melting 
(HRM)  analysis.  The  intercalating  dye  that  was  used  was 
EvaGreen  (Biotium,  USA).  The  10-μL  reaction  mixture 
was  made  up  using  the  1  x  QuantiTect  Probe  PCR  Kit 
(Qiagen,  USA)  and  consisted  of  50  ng  of  genomic  DNA, 
100  nM  of  each  primer,  and  1  x  Evagreen  solution.  PCR 
cycling  and  HRM  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the 
Rotor-Gene  thermal  cycler  RG6000  (Corbett  Research, 
Australia).  The  138-bp,  127-bp,  and  133-bp  amplicons 
were  produced  according  to  the  following  conditions; 
one  cycle  at  95oC  for  15  min;  45  cycles  at  95oC  for  15 
sec,  68oC  for  10  sec,  and  72oC  for  30  sec.  Optical 
measurements  in  the  green  channel  (excitation  at  470 
nm  and  detection  at  519  nm)  were  recorded  during  the 
extension  step.  After  a  completion  of  45  cycles,  melting 
curve  data  were  generated  by  increasing  the  temper-

Statistical  analysis

The  RA  patients  and  controls  without  RA  were  com-
pared  by  case-control  association  analyses.  χ2  tests 
were  used  to  estimate  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium 
(HWE).  Pair-wise  comparison  of  biallelic  loci  was  em-
ployed  for  the  analyses  of  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD). 
The  haplotype  frequencies  of  LRG1  for  multiple  loci 
were  estimated  using  the  expectation  maximization  (EM) 
algorithm  with  SNPAlyze  software  (DYNACOM,  Japan). 
ANOVA  was  applied  to  analyze  differences  between  the 
genotype  and  anti-CCP  or  RF  levels  in  RA  patients.  A 
P  value  of  less  than  0.05  was  considered  to  indicate 
statistical  significance.

Results

We  have  studied  cDNA  microarrays  with  mRNAs  from 
four  RA  patients  and  four  controls  and  2-DE  analysis  to 
examine  the  expression  level  of  mRNAs  as  well  as  the 
difference  in  protein  levels  between  RA  patients  and 
controls  (unpublished  data).  Human  leucine-rich  al-
pha-2-glycoprotein  1  (LRG1)  was  identified  as  one  of 
many  upregulated  genes  in  RA  patients  in  both  the 
cDNA  microarray  and  2-D  gel  analysis.  We  confirmed 
the  expression  levels  of LRG1  between  RA  patients  and 
healthy  controls  by  RT-PCR  and  validated  that  LRG1 
was  highly  expressed  in  RA  patients  compared  with 
controls  (Fig.  1A).  We  also  examined  the  expression 
pattern  of  LRG1  in  15  normal  human  tissues  and  pe-
ripheral  leukocytes.  Our  results  showed  that  the  ex-
pression  level  of LRG1  mRNA  was  highest  in  peripheral 
leukocytes,  while  the  expression  level  of LRG1  mRNA  in

brain  and  skeletal  muscle  was  only  barely  detected  (Fig. 
1B).
    To  determined  the  possible  variation  sites  in  entire  se-
quences  of  the  LRG1  gene.  including  about  2.0  kb  of 
the  promoter  region,  we  first  scanned  the  genomic  DNA 
that  was  isolated  from  24  unrelated  controls  and  24  RA 
patients  by  a  direct  sequencing  method.  We  identified 
three  SNPs-g.-678A＞G  (novel  SNP)  and  g.-404T＞C 
(rs4806985)  in  the  promoter  region,  g.1427T＞C  (rs966384) 
in  exon2-and  two  novel  variation  sites  (g.-1198  delA  and 
g.-893  delA)  (Fig.  2).  Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  co-
efficients  (|D'|)  were  calculated  between  all  SNP  pairs. 
Although  an  absolute  LD  (|D'|=1  and  r2=1)  was  not 
found,  strong  LDs  were  found  between g.-404C＞T and 
g.1427C＞T,  and  between g.-678A＞G and g. 1427T＞
C  (|D'|  =  0.91  and  0.90,  respectively).  A  single  nucleotide 

transition  (T  to  C)  at  g.1427T＞C  resulted  in  an  amino 
acid  change  to  p.Pro133Ser.  We  analyzed  the  genotype 
of  these  SNPs  in  RA  patients  and  in  controls  by  the 
HRM  method  and  compared  the  genotype  frequencies 
between  these  groups.  The  genotype  frequencies  of  all 
loci  were  in  HWE  (p＞0.05,  data  not  shown).  The  geno-
type  and  allele  frequencies  of  g.-678A＞G,  g.-404C＞T, 
and  g.1427T＞C  were  not  significantly  different  between 
RA  patients  and  controls.  These  results  suggest  that  the 
SNPs  of LRG1  are  not  associated  with  susceptibility  to 
RA  (Table  2).
    On  the  other  hand,  to  define  a  possible  correlation 
between  polymorphisms  and  clinical  features  of  RA,  we 
further  analyzed  each  genotype  of  these  SNPs  with  an-
ti-CCP  and  RF  levels  in  RA  patients  (Table  3).  We  found 
that  these  SNPs  in  RA  patients  have  no  significant  as-

haplotypes  were  identified  that  revealed  more  than 
93.3%  and  97.8%  distribution  in  the  controls  and  RA 
patients,  respectively  (Table  4).  The  distribution  rate  of 
the  haplotype  ACC  was  significantly  different  between 
the  controls  and  RA  patients  (p＜0.0003).

Discussion

RA  is  a  chronic,  systemic  inflammatory  disorder  that  af-
fects  approximately  1%  of  the  population,  at  a  fe-
male-to-male  ratio  of  3:1  (Schena  et al.,  1995).  In  this 
study,  the  genotype  and  allele  frequencies  of  LRG1 
SNPs  were  not  significantly  different  between  RA  pa-
tients  and  controls  (Table  2).  This  result  indicates  that 
the LRG1  SNPs  are  not  associated  with  a  susceptibility 
to  RA.
    LRG  has  putative  membrane-binding  domains,  which 
is  suggestive  of  the  possibility  of  protein-protein  and 
protein-deoxyribonucleic  acid  interaction  (Takahashi  et 
al.,  1985;  Kobe  &  Deisenhofer,  1994).  LRG1  is  a  novel 
ligand  for  Cyt c.  The  observation  of  Cyt c in  normal  se-
rum  and  its  binding  to  LRG1  suggests  that  these  two 
molecules  may  have  physiological  relevance.  Cyt  c 
could  serve  as  an  adaptor  by  altering  the  activity  of 
LRG1.  Pullerits  et al.  reported  that  Cyt  c  levels  in  the 
synovial  fluid  of  RA  patients  were  low  (Pullerits  et al., 
2005).  Several  studies  have  reported  that  serum  LRG 
expression  levels  were  high  in  INPH  and  cancers.  In  the 
present  study,  the  expression  levels  of  plasma  LRG1 
mRNA  were  higher  in  RA  patients  than  in  healthy 
controls.  Our  result  also  showed  that  the  expression  lev-

el  of LRG1  mRNA  was  the  highest  in  peripheral  leuko-
cytes  compared  with  various  human  tissues  (Fig.  1B). 
Our  novel  approach  might  suggest  that  LRG1  may  be 
related  to  inflammatory  responses  in  peripheral  blood.
    cDNA  microarray  technology  allows  for  expression 
monitoring,  identification,  and  quantification  of  thou-
sands  of  genes  simultaneously  (Schena  et al.,  1995; 
Shalon et al.,  1996).  Using  the  cDNA  microarray  meth-
od,  expression  analysis  in  diseased  RA  tissue  was  con-
ducted  and  demonstrated  its  utility  to  analyze  complex 
diseases,  such  as  RA,  systemic  lupus  erythematosus 
(SLE),  and  inflammatory  bowel  disease  (Heller  et al., 
1997).  Recently,  gene  expression  profiles  have  been 
identified  from  peripheral  blood  cells  of  patients  with 
SLE,  RA,  and  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  (Baechler  et al., 
2003;  Batliwalla et al.,  2005;  Bomprezzi et al.,  2003).  We 
previously  performed  cDNA  microarray  and  2-D  gel

analysis  to  screen  RA-related  specific  genes.  About  144 
and  62  genes  were  identified  as  having  more  than 
5.0-fold  higher  or  lower  mRNA  levels  in  RA  patients 
(unpublished  data).  Even  though  the  expression  levels  of 
LRG1  were  higher  in  RA  patients  than  in  controls,  the 
genetic  polymorphisms  of  LRG1  might  not  be  asso-
ciated  with  the  susceptibility  of  this  immune  disorder.
    A  hallmark  of  RA  is  the  presence  of  autoantibodies; 
therefore,  we  evaluated  whether  these  SNPs  have  asso-
ciations  with  RF  and  anti-CCP.  But  the  genotypes  of 
LRG1  gene  polymorphisms  have  no  significant  associa-
tion  with  the  RF  and  anti-CCP  levels  in  RA  patients 
(Table  3).  These  results  suggest  that  the  polymorphisms 
of  LRG1  are  not  associated  with  these  factors  in  RA 
patients.
    In  conclusion,  the  g.-678A＞G,  g.-404C＞T,  and 
g.1427T＞C  polymorphisms  of  the  LRG1  gene  do  not 
confer  genetic  susceptibility  to  RA  in  Koreans.
