Abstract 
The  KFDA  (Korea  Food  &  Drug·  Administration)  has 
performed a collaborative toxicogenomics project since 
2003.  Its aim is to construct a toxicology database of 12 
compounds  administered  to  mice  at  initial  phase.  We 
chose 6-MP (6-mercaptopurine) which has been used in 
the treatment of childhood leukemia. It was administered 
at low (0.224 mg!kg) and at high (2.24 mg/kg) dose (5 mice 
per group) intraperitonealy to the postnatal6 weeks mice, 
then the serum and liver were collected at the indicated 
time (6, 24 and 72 h) after scarification.Serum biochemical 
markers for liver toxicity were measured and histopathologic 
studies also were carried out. The gene expression profiling 
was carried out by using Applied  Biosystems 1700 Full 
Genome Expression Mouse.  By self-organization maps 
(SOM), we identified groups with unique gene expression 
patterns, some of them are supposed to be related to 6-MP 
induced  toxicity,  including  lipid  metabolism  abnormality, 
inflammatory response,  oxidative stress,  ATP depletion 
and cell  death. The potential toxic effects appearing as 
gene expression changes are dependent of the time of 
6-MP but independent of the dosage of it. This study would 
contribute to establishment of international database as 
well as national one about hepatotoxicity.

Introduction 
So far, the field of toxicogenomics has mainly concentrated 
on  hepatotoxicity,  since the  liver is the primary target of 
most toxic responses.  The liver is the first organs to be 
exposed when chemicals are administered via the portal 
vein or perorally. Chemical concentrations in the liver are

often  a  lot  higher than  the  peak plasma concentration. 
The liver is also the main site for metabolizing xenobiotics 
and diverse chemicals can cause the formation of active 
metabolites which have an effect on toxicity. 

The  TGRC  (Toxicogenomics  research  Consortium) 
hosted  by  KFDA  (Korea  Food  & Drug  Administration) 
consists of 6  laboratory to construct database of acute 
and  subchronic  toxicity  of  chemical  entities.  The  12 
chemicals  have  been  selected  for  the  project  and  2 
compounds per laboratory were assigned.  The following 
are  examined  for  each.  The  in  vivo  test  using  mice 
consists  of  a  single  administration  test  (6,  24 and  72h 
with 2 dose levels including vehicle control) and the data 
of  histopathological  examination  of  liver  and  blood 
biochemistry are obtained from each animal. 

We chose 6-Mercaptopurine (6-MP) out of 12 com(cid:173)

pounds. The drug affects mainly bone marrow suppression 
but  its  hepatotoxicity has also  been  demonstrated  in 
many researches (Tapner eta/., 2004; Berkovitch et at., 
1996;  Schmiegelow  et at.,  1992)  to  prove  an  animal 
modelof  liver toxicity.  6-MP  is  one  of  a  large  series  of 
purine  analogues  which  interfere  with  nucleic  acid 
biosynthesis  and  has  been  used  in  the  treatment  of 
childhood leukemia since 1953 (Burchenal  et at.,  1953}. 
6MP  acts  as  a  prodrug,  which  is  metabolized  through 
different steps into 6TG (&thioguanine) nucleotides. These 
are incorporated into DNA, leading to replicative error and 
cell  death.  6MP  is  also  a  substrate  for  thiopurine 
methyltransferase (TPMT), which inactivates 6MP into 
methylmercaptopurine. lnterindividual variation in TPMT 
activity  is  great,  and  patients  with  high  enzyme  activity 
accumulate  lower  concentrations  of  6TG  nucleotides 
(Lennard  et  at.,  1993).  The  clinical  symptoms  and 
histologycal  experiment  about  toxicity  by  &Mercaptopurine 
have been reported (Berkovitch et at., 1996; Michael et at., 
2004; Nygaard eta/., 2004), but gene expression change 
analysis  that  use  DNA  Microarray  has  never been 
attempted. The purpose of the current study is to investigate 
the  correlation  between  biochemical  markers and  gene 
expression profile at 6-MP-treated mice, and to construct a 
toxicology database about 6MP. 

Methods 
Animals and ~MP administration 
Approximately 6-week-old SLC-ICR male mice were assigned 

Gene Expression Profiling of 6-MP (6-mercaptopurine) in Liver  17 

to  9  groups  (5  mice/group).  Mice  were  administration  a 
single dose of 6MP (Sigma) dissolved in distilled water by 
intraperitoneal  injection.  The  dosing  solutions  were 
prepared to deliver a volume of 5 ml/kg as follows; 2.24 
mg/kg high dose, 0.224 mg/kg low dose. At the indicated 
time  (6,  24  and  72h  after  the  administration),  blood 
samples were collected from the atrium, and then the mice 
were sacrificed and the livers collected. At the same time 
a  cross-section  of  the  left  lateral  lobe  of  the  liver  was 
collected in 10% neutral buffered formalin for histopathology. 
The remaining portions of liver were collected in RNase-free 
tubes and snap-frozen  in  liquid  nitrogen.  Frozen  tissues 
were stored at -70 oc to extract RNA 

Biochemical and histopathological examination 
After the blood serum was isolated by centrifusion at 3000 
rpmfor20min, itwasstoreat-70°C. Twotypical biochemical 
markers for hepatotoxicity (alanine aminotransferase, AL T; 
aspartate aminotrasnferase, AST)  were measured using 
an  autoanalyzer  (Prestige  24i,  Tokyo  Boeki  Medical 
System, Japan). 

The liver tissues to be examined histologycally were 
fixed  in  5%  neutral-buffered  formalin,  embedded  in 
paraffin and subsequently sectioned.  The tissues stained 
with hematoxylin/eosin were conducted by pathologist. 

Microarray analysis 
Total RNA from the liver tissues was extracted with Trizol® 
reagent  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  USA)  and  RNeasy  kits 
(Qiagen,  U.K) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 
Equal  amounts  of  total  RNA  from  samples  of  each 
administration were used for the microarray analysis and 
reverse transcripatase (RT)-PCR. 

Microarray  experiments  were  performed  using  an 
Applied Biosystems 1700 Full Genome Expression Mouse 
Microarray (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according 
to the  manufacturer's  protocol.  The  array  consisted  of 
33315  probes  including  ESTs.  Array  hybridization, 
chemiluminescence  detection,  image  acquisition  and 
analysis were  performed  using  an  Applied  Biosystems 
Chemiluminescence Detection Kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Foster  City,  CA)  and  Applied  Biosystems  1'700 
Chemiluminescent  Microarray  Analyzer  following  the 

manufacturer's protocol. 

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed as follows: 
2 J.tg of total RNA were transcribed into eDNA by reverse 
transcription  with  AMVReverse  Transcriptase  (lntron, 
Korea) using an oligo (dT)15 primer in a total volume of 20 
/d.  Reverse transcription was performed for 60 min at 42 
oc  in  a  thermocycler  (Biometra,  Gottingen,  Germany) 
followed by 5 min at 70°C.  1 td of the  AT-reaction were 
used  for  PCR  experiments.  Primer  sequences  were 
listed  in  Table  1.The  PCR  conditions  consisted  of  an 
initial denaturation 95 oc for 2 min, 30 cycles at 95 oc for 
30 sec, 45-60 oc for 30 sec, and 72 oc for 30 sec, and a 
final  extension at 72 oc for 10 min.  The PCR products 
were  separated  on  1.5% agarose  gels  and  visualized 
using ethidium  bromide staining  under UV light.  These 
samples  were  also  amplified  with  primers  for  .13-actin, 
housekeeping gene. 

Bioinforrntics analysis 
To  minimize  number  of  falsely  significant  genes,  we 
performed  multiple testing.  The genes  were  filtered  by 
flag  threshold  (flag  smaller  than  1 00)  and  performed 
quantile  normalization.  Two-way  ANOVA  (analysis  of 
variatio)  was  used  to  identify  differentially  expressed 
genes.  Using SOM cluster classified each  group which 
had  similar  expression  pattern.  The  significant  genes 
were classified by Gene ontologyand pathway. 

Results and Discussion 
The ultimate purpose of this study is to establish a gene 
expression  database for prediction of acute  hepatotox(cid:173)
icity  after  6MP-administered.  The  6-MP  induced  acute 
hepatotoxic response  by a variety of observed  mecha(cid:173)
nisms, including necrosis, steatosis, inflammatory response 
and  ATP  depletion.  An  earlier  time  point  would  likely 
have included immediate early response genes. Hepatic 
centrilobular necrosis was found after 6 h in mice at the 
two doses, but not in 72 h.  Gene expression profile also 
changed regardless of dose. This suggests that hepatotox(cid:173)
icity  induced  by  6MP  is  not  dose-dependant  but  time(cid:173)
dependant.

Histopathologic and biochemical analysis 
H & E evaluation of stained liver sections revealed a little 
histopathological difference in mice treated 6MP (Fig. 1 ). 
There were some changes in the livers treated with 2.24 
mglkg and 0.224 mglkg 6MP at 6 h regardless of dose. 
The  minimal  disarray  of  lobular  architecture  with  mild 
degree of hepatocellular necrosis was accompanied by 
infiltration  of lymphocytes.  The 24 h-livers were similar 
with 6 h-liver, but their cells were more swollen compared 
with 6 h. The livers of 72 h after the administration were 
recovered cell to swell. 

The serum transferase levels in the 6MP-administered 
groups were measured at 6, 24 and 72 h after administration 
(Fig.  2}  Measure of AST and AL T  enables to assess 
hepatocellular injury and death (Scheig, 1996). Both AST 
and AL T  levels were the highest in  the high  dose(cid:173)
administered groups at 6 h,  but little difference in the low 
doseadministered groups. Taking these results into considera(cid:173)
tion,  the  maximal  toxic times  of each  6MP dosage were 
estimated as 6h in high dose. 

Gene expression profile in 6MP-administered mice 
The gene expression profiles in the two dose and five time 

points  were  determined  using  the  data  from  the  DNA 
microarray.  Scatter  plot  of  geneexpression  between 
vehicle controls at each time point revealed that most of 
the genes distributed within a 1.5 fold  range of their 45o 
line, meaning that few gene were affected by the vehicle 
(data not shown). 

Gene expression profiles of interest were significantly 
up- or down- regulated  in  mice treated  with  6MP when 
compared to control. Table 2 shows the list of genes that 
showed at least a 1.5 fold difference in at least one time 
point  with  p<0.01.  Based  on  each  gene  annotation,  8 
categories were classified; lipid metabolism, lipid transport, 
cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis,  inflammatory 
response,  response to stress,  oxidation,  cell  death and 
ribosome biogenesis. Though very low dose was treated, 
hepatotoxic-associated  genes  that  were  presentedby 
acute exposure were expressed differently. Many of the 
genes are related lipid metabolism. As shown in Table 2 
the maximal up-or down-regulated time points in almost 
all  the  individual  gene expression  profiles  reflected  the 
maximal toxic time. 

We  also performed  hierarchical  clustering  based  on 
each dosage (data not shown). Because 6MP was treated 
very low dose, the gene expression changes were small

and no changes between the two dosage groups. However, 
in time-dependent manner, the distance between the early 
(6h) and the late(24h and72 h) phase was increased (Table2). 

Lipid metabolism 
Table 2 shows that treatment with 6MP resulted in regulation 
of a number of genes in the cholesterol and fatty acid path-
ways, including an up-regulation of Sth2 (sulfotransferase, 
hydroxysteroid preferring 2), ldi1  (isopentenyl-diphosphate 
delta isomerase),  Elovl3 (elongation of very long chain 
fatty acids-like 3), Aldh1 a3 (aldehyde dehydrogenase family 
1, subfamily A3),  Hsd3b4 (hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-
4),  Hmgcs1  (aldehyde  dehydrogenase  family  1 ).  They 
were usually over-expressed at 6h after administered and 
returned to the same level  or lower at 24 h:  Sth2.  ldi1. 

Elovl3, Hsd3b4, Aldh1 a?. A few of these genes involve in 
steatosis.  Steatosis  is  a  common  response  to  acute 
exposure to many but not all hepatotoxins (Farrell, 1994) 
Among  cytosolic  sulfotransferases,  hydroxysteroid 
sulfotransferase  termed  Sth2  (SUL T2A)  is  known  to 
catalyze sulfation of bile acids. The biological functions 
of  Sth2  include  hormone  regulation/metabolism  and 
xenobiotic  detoxification.  There  are  reports  showing 
high  excretion  of  sulfated  bile  acids  in  liver  disorders 
(Takikawa et at.,  1984; Makino et at.,  1974). In this data 
Sth2 gene was expressed highly at 6 h in both low and 
high dose and decreased rapidly at 24 h and 72 h. These 
results  suggest  the  possibility  that  Sth2  induction  is  a 
general  adaptive  response  to  extranormal  levels  of  bile 
acids in liver of mammals. 

Gene Expression Profiling of 6-MP (6-mercaptopurine) in  Liver  21 

Structure and cytoskeleton 

Hepatotoxicants  disrupt  the  integrity  of  hepatocyte 
cytoskeleton  by  affecting  proteins  that  are  vital  to  its 
dynamic  nature  (Phillips  eta/.,  1986;  Runnegar  eta/., 
1995). The genes related cytoskeleton organization and 
biogenesis  were  also  up-regulated:  · Krt2-7,  Tuba1, 
Myo1f.  The induction  of both the protein  synthesis  and 
the cell-structure genes suggests that enhanced protein 
synthesis  and/or  proliferation  occur,  which  aids  in 
hepatic  tissue  remodeling  and  recovery  (Heijne  eta/., 
2004) after 6MP-induced hepatocellular injury. 

AQrtephaseresponse 
The acute phase response is elicited by various types of 
stress like mechanical damage and inflammation (Rarnadori 
and Christ,  1999; Suffredini eta/., 1999). Especially in the 
liver, changes in many genes provide a protective response 
and re-establish cellular homeostasis.  We identified that 
the acute phase response was elicited upon an intraperito(cid:173)
neal  administration  of  6MP.  Oas3  (2'-5'  oligoadenylate 
synthetase 3), Reg3a (regenerating islet-derived 3 alpha), 
V1 rh12  (vomeronasal  1 receptor,  H12) and Blnk (B-cell 
linker) were expressed largely in both low dose and high 
dose group at 6 h. Rad541 (RAD541ike), Ccl17 (chemokine 
(C-C  motif)  ligand  17),  Tnfsf11 (tumor  necrosis  factor 
superfamily),  Csen (calsenilin) and Slc26a4(solute carrier 
family 26,  member 4) were up-regulated by 6MP in only 
high dose. 

Raet1 b  (retinoic  acid  early  transcript  delta),  Cxcl9 
(chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9) and Reg3a (regenerating 
islet-derived 4 alpha) associated with inflammation were 
up-regulated significantly at 6h after low and high dose. 
Theinflammation results in cirrhosis. All tissues were not 
severe, but some of them may have indicated slight cirrhosis. 

Oxidative stress 
Clinically  relevant  concentrations of  6MP  are toxic to  rat 
hepatocyte cultures by a mechanism that involves oxidative 
stress,  mitochondrial injury and ATP depletion (Tapner et 
a/.,  2004).  Our result also showed genes associated ·illlith 
oxidation, Loxl1  (lysyl oxidase-like 1) and Lrrc16 (leucine rich 
repeat containing 16), up-regulated at 6 hand 24 h. This can 
lead  to  irreversible  de-energization  and  cell  death  by 
necrosis. 

Apoptosis and necrosis 
At histopathologic analysis, livers of 6 h after dosing E>MP 
appeared  necrosis.  Many  genes  associated  with  cell 
death were expressed at the livers, too. For 6MP treating, 
oxidant stress can activate cell death signaling pathways 

such  as  Bak1  (BCL2-antagonistlkiller  1)  and  Casp6 
(caspase 6).  Although  the increase in  gene expression 
does  not  necessarily  indicate  that  the  relevant  gene 
products  are  involved  in  apoptosis,  these  results  are 
suggestive that the pathway involving Bak1, Casp6 and 
DNase  1 participates  in  6MP induced  apoptosis.  Since 
apoptosis is controlled by interactions between pro- and 
anti-apoptotic machineries, the up-regulation of negative 
effectors of apoptosis may also contribute to regulating 
6MP-induced apoptosis (Kim eta/., 2005). 

Rivosome biogenesis 
In the acute model, many genes associated with ribosome 
biogenesis have been reported to be up-regulated during 
the injury stage (Chung eta/., 2005). Rps6ka2 (ribosomal 
protein 86 kinase, polypeptide 2) was expressed highly at 
6h in  both low dose and high dose, while was down(cid:173)
regulated at 24 hand 72 h.  Rps14 (ribosomal protein 814) 
was up-regulated in all except 72 h in the low dose. 

Recovery 
Most of gene expression profiles obtained from livers isolated 
72 h after both low and high 6MP dose resembled the profiles 
of the control-livers. This suggests that the mice in the 72 h 
group did not suffer, or recovered from the toxic stimulus. 

Validation of gene expression changes 
To confirm the microarray results, we selected 5 (Hsd3b4, 
Krt2,  Tuba1,  Myo1f) known  genes that are  related  to 
hepatotoxicity for semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmation 
of differential expression. In general, the semi-quantitative 
RT-PCR  results were similar to time-dependent results 
obtained with the DNA microarrays (Fig 3).

of each gene was normalized by that of .[3-actin.  From the list in 
Table 2, four of the genes involved in hepatotoxicity were selected 
for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The primer sets used for RT-PCR 
are shown in Table 1. The RNA samples used for semi-quantitative 
RT -PCR were identical to those used for the microarray analysis.

Conclusion 

In  summary,  acute exposure of 6-MP administered  mice 
resulted  in  toxic  manifestations  and  numerous  gene 
expression changes. Mechanisms of 6MP-induced injury of 
liver cells includelipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage 
and disruption of the cytoskeleton. These effects may play 
a  role  in  6-MP-induced  hepatotoxicity  and  may  be  of 
particular  toxicologicalrelevance.  We  expect  that  drug 
action related to hepatotoxicity may be detected in detail 
using our database.
