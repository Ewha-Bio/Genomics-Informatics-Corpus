Abstract

The  differentiation  of  neural  precursor  cells  (NPCs)  into 
neurons  and  astrocytes  is  a  process  that  is  tightly  con-
trolled  by  complicated  and  ill-defined  gene  networks.  To 
extend  our  knowledge  to  gene  networks,  we  performed 
a  temporal  analysis  of  gene  expression  during  the  differ-
entiation  (2,  4,  and  8  days)  of  spinal  cord-derived  NPCs 
using  oligonucleotide  microarray  technology.  Out  of 
32,996  genes  analyzed,  1878  exhibited  significant 
changes  in  expression  level  (fold  change＞2,  p＜0.05)  at 
least  once  throughout  the  differentiation  process.  These 
1878  genes  were  classified  into  12  groups  by  k-means 
clustering,  based  on  their  expression  patterns.  K-means 
clustering  analysis  revealed  that  the  genes  involved  in 
astrogenesis  were  categorized  into  the  clusters  contain-
ing  constantly  upregulated  genes,  whereas  the  genes  in-
volved  in  neurogenesis  were  grouped  to  the  cluster 
showing  a  sudden  decrease  in  gene  expression  on  Day 
8.  Functional  analysis  of  the  differentially  expressed 
genes  indicated  the  enrichment  of  genes  for  Pax6- 

NeuroD  signaling−TGFb-SMAD  and  BMP-SMAD−which 

suggest  the  implication  of  these  genes  in  the  differ-
entiation  of  NPCs  and,  in  particular,  key  roles  for  Nova1 
and  TGFBR1  in  the  neurogenesis/astrogenesis  of  mouse 
spinal  cord.

Genetic  programming  of  multipotent  neural  precursor

drocytes,  and  astrocytes  in vivo.  The  differentiation  of 
NPCs  occurs  in  highly  specific  manners  both  in  tempo-
ral  and  spatial  aspects  (Lee et al.,  2003)  and  results  in 
production  of  neuronal-restricted  precursors  (NRPs)  and 
glial-restricted  precursors  (GRPs),  which  subsequently 
develop  into  mature  neurons  and  glial  cells,  respectively 
(Kalyani  et al.,  1998).  in vivo,  NPCs  generate  neurons 
first  and  then  produce  mainly  astrocytes  (Sun  et al., 
2003;  Cheng  et al.,  2006).  This  unvarying  sequential 
generation,  the  so-called  gliogenic  switch,  is  reported  to 
be  conserved  across  vertebrates  having  a  central  nerv-
ous  system  (CNS),  suggesting  its  fundamental  role  in 
neuronal  differentiation  mechanisms  (Deneen  et  al., 
2006).  This  sequential  generation  of  neurons  and  as-
trocytes  can  be  repeated in vitro.  It  has  been  reported 
that  when  incubated  in  growth  factor-free  culture  me-
dium,  NPCs  from  early  developmental  stages  differ-
entiate  into  neurons,  whereas  those  from  late  embryonic 
and  early  postnatal  stages  differentiate  into  astrocytes 
(Qian  et al.,  2000).
    Proliferation  of  NPCs  occurs  and  stays  in  the  ven-
tricular  zone  of  the  neural  tube  at  an  early  devel-
opmental  stage.  In  the  presence  of  intrinsic  and  environ-
mental  signals,  some  of  these  precursor  cells  exit  the 
proliferation  cycle  and  express  young  neuronal  and  glial 
characteristics.  The  postmitotic  cell  bodies  and  differ-
entiating  cells  are  confined  within  the  mantle  layer  and 
give  rise  to  a  distinct  grey  appearance.  Within  this  layer, 
some  neurons  develop  local  interconnections,  while  oth-
ers  elaborate  axons  to  distal  targets  and  form  the  mar-
ginal  layer  during  the  process.  Glial  cells  gradually  en-
capsulate  the  axons  producing  a  marginal  layer,  which 
demonstrates  a  distinctive  white  appearance  in  the  adult 
spinal  cord.  In  this  way,  neuronal  and  glial  cells  follow 
a  developmental  program  that  depends  on  temporal  and 
regional  patterning  (Poh  et al.,  2002).
    Recent  progress  in  the  field  has  improved  our  under-
standing  of  the  genetic  control  involved  in  neurogenesis 
and  gliogenesis.  For  example,  the  identification  of  the 
basic  helix-loop-helix  (bHLH)  transcription  factor  has  al-
lowed  us  to  further  understand  the  molecular  regulation 
of  vertebrate  neurogenesis  and  gliogenesis  (Bertrand et 
al.,  2002;  Kageyama et al.,  2005;  Lu et al.,  2000;  Zhou 
and  Anderson,  2002).  Despite  the  identification  of  in-
trinsic  cellular  factors  and  extracellular  cues,  the  molec-
ular  bases  of  general  programs,  including  sequential 
generation,  are  not  yet  fully  understood.  In  this  study, 
we  employed  microarray  analysis  to  monitor  the  tempo-

ral  changes  of  gene  expression  during  NPC  differ-
entiation  and  to  identify  the  genes  playing  pivotal  roles 
in  the  process. 

Methods

Cell  culture

factor 

in  DMEM/F12 

Spinal  cords  of  C57BL/6  mouse  embryos  at  embryonic 
day  11.5  (E11.5)  were  dissected  in  Hank’s  buffered 
saline  solution  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA).  Cells 
from  spinal  cords  were  mechanistically  dissociated  and 
plated  on  T-25  or  6-well  culture  dishes.  For  neurosphere 
formation,  cells  were  grown 
(1:1, 
Invitrogen)  media  with  N2  supplement  (Invitrogen)  at 
37oC  in  a  5%  CO2  humidified  atmosphere  in  the  pres-
ence  of  20  ng/ml  epidermal  growth 
(EGF; 
Invitrogen)  and  basic  fibroblast  growth  factor  (bFGF, 
Invitrogen)  for  4  days.  EGF  and  bFGF  were  added  to 
the  culture  medium  every  2  days.  Subsequently,  the  cul-
ture  medium  containing  floating  neurospheres  was  col-
lected  in  sterile  15  ml  tubes  and  centrifuged  at  110  rela-
tive  centrifugal  forces  for  5  min.  The  neurosphere  pellets 
were  dissociated  with  trypsin,  and  single  cells  were 
seeded  at  a  density  of  approximately  4×104  cells/cm2 
in  6-well  culture  dishes  or  12-mm  glass  cover  slips 
coated  with  poly-L-ornithine  (0.1  mg/ml,  Sigma-Aldrich, 
St.  Louis,  MO,  USA)  and  fibronectin  (1  ug/ml,  Sigma- 
Aldrich).  Cells  in  the  culture  dishes  were  allowed  to  at-
tach  during  growth  in  the  same  medium  for  2  days. 
Differentiation  was  induced  by  withdrawal  of  bFGF  and 
EGF.  These  spinal  cord  precursor  cells  were  incubated 
under  the  differentiation  conditions  for  8  days.

Immunocytochemistry

Spinal  cord  precursor  and  differentiated  cells  were  fixed 
in  4%  paraformaldehyde-containing  phosphate-buffered 
saline  (PBS)  at  room  temperature  for  10  min.  After  rins-
ing  several  times  with  PBS,  the  cells  were  incubated  for 
10  min  in  PBS  containing  0.4%  Triton  X-100  and  re-
rinsed  with  PBS  containing  0.1%  Tween-20  (TPBS). 
Then,  the  cells  were  incubated  for  2  h  with  10%  horse 
serum  or  10%  goat  serum  in  TPBS.  To  reduce  non-
specific  antibody  binding,  the  cells  were  incubated  over-
night  at  4oC  with  primary  antibodies  depending  on  con-
ditions;  mouse  monoclonal  anti-nestin  (1:100,  Chemicon, 
Temecula,  CA,  USA),  mouse  monoclonal  Tuj1  (1:100, 
Covance,  East  Lansing,  MI,  USA),  low-affinity  neuro-
trophin  receptor  (p75,  1:100,  Chemicon),  and  GFAP 
(1:100,  DAKO,  Glostrup,  Denmark).  After  rinsing  with 
TPBS  3  times,  the  cells  were  incubated  with  fluorescein 
isothiocyanate-  or  Texas  red-conjugated  secondary  anti-

body  (1:100,  Vector  Laboratories,  Burlingame,  CA,  USA) 
for  2  h  at  room  temperature.  Cell  nuclei  were  counter-
stained  with  4',  6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  (DAPI;  Vector 
Laboratories) 
temperature. 
Fluorescent  images  were  captured  with  a  Leica  DM  IRB 
microscope  (Leica  Microsystems,  Wetzlar,  Germany) 

for  10  min  at 

room 

RNA  isolation  and  DNA  microarray

Total  RNA  was  extracted  using  Trizol  reagent  (Invitro-
gen)  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s  manual. 
Quantification  and  determination  of  purity  (260/280  ratio) 
of  RNA  were  performed  using  an  ND-1000  UV/VIS  spec-
trophotometer  (NanoDrop  Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE, 
USA).  A  commercial  mouse  genome  survey  array  was 
used  for  differential  gene  expression  profiling  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA).  The  array  consists 
of  60-mer  oligonucleotide  probes,  representing  a  set  of 
32,996  individual  mouse  genes  and  more  than  1000 
control  probes.  Microarray  experiments  were  performed 
following  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  Briefly,  digox-
igenin  (DIG)-UTP-labeled  cRNA  was  generated  by  ampli-
fication  of  5μg  of  total  RNA  using  a  chemiluminescent 
reverse  transcription  in vitro  transcription  labeling  kit 
(Applied  Biosystems).  Each  microarray  was  prehybri-
dized  in  hybridization  buffer  with  blocking  reagent  at 
55oC  for  1  h.  Hybridization  of  arrays  was  then  carried 
out  using  DIG-labeled  cRNA  (10μg),  fragmented  into 
sizes  of  100-400  bp,  at  55oC  for  16  h.  The  arrays  were 
washed  with  hybridization  wash  buffer,  followed  by  a 
subsequent  wash  with  chemiluminescence  rinse  buffer. 
Chemiluminescent  signals  were  generated  by  incubating 
the  arrays  with  anti-DIG  alkaline  phosphatase  and 
chemiluminescence  substrate.  Images  were  collected  for 
each  microarray  using  the  Model  1700  Chemilumines-
cent  Microarray  Analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems).  Microar-
ray  images  were  autogrided,  and  the  chemiluminescent 
signals  were  quantified,  corrected  for  background,  and 
spatially  normalized.

Analysis  of  microarray  expression  data

Signal  intensities  were  imported  into  GenPlex  software 
(Istech,  Korea)  and  normalized  to  reduce  interarray  var-
iation  in  hybridization  intensity  after  filtering  out  probe 
sets  with  unreliable  intensity  values  (flag  value＜100  and 
S/N＜2).  Expression  changes  were  presented  as 
fold-changes  in  comparison  with  intensities  from  the 
control  group.  The  expression  intensities  were  then 
log2-transformed.  We  took  the  average  value  from  the 
gene  expression  ratio  obtained  in  3  biological  replicates. 
DEGs  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  ratios  (fold  change 
＞2)  and  Welch’s  t-test  (p＜0.05).  For  further  analysis,

(B)  DAPI  nuclear  staining  results.  Most  cells  at  Day  0  were  immunostained  in  green  with  the  intermediate  filament  nestin,  an

removal,  differentiated  cells  were  immunostained  with  Tuj1  (green),  the  neuron  marker  GFAP  (red),  and  the  astrocyte  and  mo-
toneuron  marker  p75  (green).  The  results  shown  in  the  graph  are  percentages  (mean±SEM;  n=3)  of  nestin-,  Tuj1-,  GFAP-,

genes  using  the  Euclidean  distance  as  a  similarity

(http://genome.tugraz.at).  Additionally,  DEGs

using  the  PANTHER  (Protein  ANalysis  THrough  Evolutio-
nary  Relationships)  protein  classification  system  (Applied

Protein  interaction  network  analysis 

To  further  define  the  molecular  mechanism  involved  in 
the  differentiation  of  spinal  cord  precursor  cells,  Cyto-
scape  ver.  2.5  software  was  used  for  protein  interaction 
analysis  to 
identify  potential  regulatory  genes  and 
pathways.  The  molecular  interaction  data  were  down-
loaded  from  the  BIND  and  BIOGRID  websites.  Each  da-
taset  was  loaded  separately  to  the  software,  and  2  dis-
tinct  protein-protein  interaction  networks  were  gene-
rated.  For  each  network,  the  DEGs  were  mapped,  and 
the  proteins  that  interacted  directly  with  the  DEGs  were 
selected  to  generate  groups  of  subnetworks.  The  sub-
networks  were  merged  into  a  single  subnetwork  using 
the  “union”  function  in  Cytoscape,  and  the  nodes  inter-
acting  with  more  than  9  proteins  were  selected.

Verification  of  microarray 

For  semiquantitative  RT-PCR,  beta-actin  was  used  as 
an  internal  control.  For  each  sample,  the  same  total 
RNA  that  was  used  for  microarray  hybridization  was  re-
verse-transcribed  using  1μM  oligo  (dT)  primer  with 

Superscript  II  reverse  transcriptase  (Invitrogen).  The  ther-
mal  profiles  consisted  of  95oC  for  5  min  for  initial  dena-
turing,  followed  by  25∼30  cycles  of  95oC  for  30  s,  55∼
60oC  for  30  s,  and  72oC  for  30  s  to  1  min.  All  RT-PCR 
reactions  were  repeated  at  least  3  times.  The  primers 
used  in  this  study  are  listed  in  Table  1. 

Results  and  Discussion

Verification  of  spinal  cord  precursor  cells  into 
neuronal  cells  by  immunocytochemistry 

Prior  to  gene  expression  study  of  spinal  cord  precursor 
cells,  their  differentiation  process  was  monitored  by  im-
munocytochemical  detection  using  the  most  representa-
tive  neural  markers,  such  as  nestin,  Tuj1,  and  GFAP. 
The  differentiation  was  initiated  by  removing  basic  fibro-
blast  growth  factor  (bFGF)  from  the  medium  on  Day  0, 
and  the  process  was  monitored  on  Days  2,  4,  and  8  af-
ter  the  initiation  (Fig.  1). 
    On  Day  0,  most  cells  in  the  culture  (92.6±1.1%)  were 
nestin-positive,  a  common  characteristic 
for  NPCs, 
whereas  only  a  small  portion  (less  than  2.5%  and  3.5%)

of  the  total  cells  were  found  to  be  tubulin  βIII  (Tuj1)- 
positive  and  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP)-positive, 
specific  characteristics 
for  neurons  and  astrocytes, 
respectively.  As  the  differentiation  progressed,  the  pro-
portion  of  nestin-positive  cells  in  the  culture  decreased 
subsequently  to  71.0±9.8%,  6.3±2.5%,  and  3.7±1.5% 
on  Days  2,  4,  and  8,  respectively.  In  the  meantime,  the 
proportion  of  Tuj1-positive  cells  reached  5.7±1.7%  of 
total  cells  on  Day  2  and  decreased  gradually  thereafter 
(3.9%±1.4%  on  Day  4  and  3.3±0.4%  on  Day  8).  It 
was  noticed  that  a  small  portion  of  the  Tuj1-positive 
cells  were  also  immunoreactive  to  anti-p75  antibody  on 
Days  2,  4,  and  8,  which  is  a  characteristic  of  motoneur-
ons  in  the  developing  neural  tube  (Camu  and  Hender-
son,  1992).  The  number  of  GFAP-positive  cells  in-
creased  along  the  differentiation  process,  representing 
8.9±0.3%  on  Day  2,  75.9±6.0%  on  Day  4,  and  86.5± 
0.8%  of  total  cells  on  Day  8.  This  observation  coincides 
well  with  a  previous  report  (Kalyani  et al.,  1997),  in 
which  GFAP-positive  cells  constituted  the  largest  portion 
(73±6.0%)  of  the  total  population  of  differentiated  neu-
roepithelial  cells  after  5  days  of  differentiation. 
    Based  on  the  immunocytochemical  observation  pre-

sented  in  this  study,  it  was  confirmed  that  spinal  cord 
precursor  cells  sequentially  generate  neurons  and  as-
trocytes  along  the  process,  the  so-called  gliogenic 
switch,  as  described  in  a  previous  report  (Qian  et al., 
2000). 

Identification  of  differentially  expressed  genes

To  examine  the  temporal  changes  in  gene  expression 
along  the  differentiation,  the  expression  level  of  the 
whole  genome  was  profiled  using  a  microarray.  Total 
RNA  from  cells  on  Day  0,  Day  2,  Day  4,  and  Day  8  of 
differentiation  was  subjected  to  microarray  analysis. 
Gene  expression  levels  in  NPCs  (Day  0)  were  compared 
with  those  in  differentiated  cells  (Days  2,  4,  and  8).  Out 
of  the  32,996  genes  represented  on  the  chip,  1878  were 
differentially  expressed  more  than  2-fold  at  least  at  one 
point  during  the  experiment  (Fig.  2A  and  Supplemental 
data).  On  Day  2,  517  genes  were  upregulated  and  379 
genes  were  downregulated.  On  Day  4,  658  genes  were 
upregulated  and  403  genes  were  downregulated.  On 
Day  8,  when  most  spinal  cord  precursor  cells  were  dif-
ferentiated  into  astrocytes,  1554  genes  showed  modu-

classified  into  12  clusters  based  on  similar  expression  over  the  3  time  points.  The  number  at  the  center  of  each  cluster  inset 
represents  the  number  of  genes  in  that  particular  cluster.  Lines  indicate  the  mean  expression  value.

lated  expression  levels  (Fig.  2B).

K-means  clustering  analysis  of  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes 

To  characterize  the  patterns  of  gene  expression  along 
the  time  course  of  differentiation,  k-means  clustering 
was  performed  on  the  1878  differentially  expressed 
genes.  The  genes  were  classified  into  12  clusters  (Fig. 
3).  Six  clusters  showed  a  gradual  increase  by  Day  8. 

The  expression  of  genes  in  clusters  A  and  B  was  upre-
gulated  more  than  2-fold  at  all  time  points.  In  particular, 
Cluster  B  comprised  highly  upregulated  genes  (＞eight 
folds)  and  included  the  astrocyte-specific  marker  GFAP. 
Clusters  C  and  D  consisted  of  genes  that  were  con-
stantly  upregulated  more  than  2-fold  at  all  time  points. 
Four  clusters  contained  genes  with  decreasing  ex-
pression  as  the  differentiation  progressed.  Clusters  G 
and  K  comprised  genes  whose  expression  decreased 
more  than  2-fold  at  all  time  points.

Representative  groups  with  p  value  lower  than  0.05  in  each  cluster  are  listed.  Expected  value  is  the  number  of  genes  that 
would  be  expected  for  a  particular  PANTHER  category,  based  on  1878  differentially  expressed  genes  (reference  list).  p  value 
was  determined  by  the  binomial  statistic.

Gene  Expression  Profiling  of  Spinal  Cord-derived  NPCs      91

Functional  enrichment  analysis  of  K-means  clus-
tered  genes 

To  identify  genes  involved  in  the  differentiation  of  spinal 
cord  precursor  cells,  it  was  of  interest  to  apply  an  onto-
logical  study  to  the  clustered  genes.  For  this  purpose, 
functional  enrichment  analyses  were  performed  on  the 
differentially  expressed  genes  grouped  in  each  cluster. 
Table  2  summarizes  the  list  of  biological  functions  that 
were  overrepresented  among  the  differentially  expressed 
genes  in  each  cluster.  Based  on  the  enrichment  analy-
sis,  only  clusters  A,  C,  D,  and  L  showed  significant  en-
richment  (p＜0.05)  of  biological  functions  related  to  neu-
ronal  development,  such  as  development/developmental 
processes,  neuronal  activities,  neurogenesis,  and  syn-
aptic  transmission.  The  list  of  genes  that  contributed  to 
enrichment  of  biological  function  in  clusters  A,  C,  D,  and 
L  is  summarized  in  Table  3. 
    In  cluster  C,  in  which  most  genes  were  constantly  up-
regulated  more  than  2-fold  at  all  time  points,  we  noticed 
the  presence  of  basic  helix-loop-helix  domain-containing 
class  B5  (Bhlhb5).  In  a  previous  report,  the  Bhlhb5  gene 
was  identified  as  a  member  of  a  new  subclass  of  the 
bHLH  family  (Bramblett  et al.,  2002;  McLellan  et al., 
2002).  The  proteins  in  this  class,  as  well  as  members  of 

the  HES  and  ID  families,  are  considered  negative  regu-
lators  of  the  function  and/or  transcription  of  other  bHLH 
proteins  (e.g.,  Mash1,  Math,  and  Neurogenin2)  that  are 
necessary  and  sufficient  to  promote  neuronal  differ-
entiation  (Kageyama  et al.,  2005).  It  has  been  also  re-
ported  that  the  inhibitory  HLH  factors  Id1  and  Hes1 
stimulate  astrogenesis  in vitro  (Sugimori  et al.,  2007) 
and  that  mouse  Bhlhb5  represses  a  human  Pax6  pro-
moter  (Xu  et al.,  2002).  Bhlhb5,  constantly  upregulated 
along  the  differentiation,  suggests  a  possible  implication 
of  this  protein  during  gliogenic  differentiation  as  a  tran-
scriptional  regulator.
    Cluster  D,  which  consisted  of  168  constantly  upregu-
lated  genes,  showed  significant  enrichment  of  genes  re-
lated  to  biological  functions,  such  as  neuronal  activities, 
synaptic  transmission,  and  developmental  processes 
(Table  2).  Among  the  genes  that  belong  to  enriched  bio-
logical  functions  in  cluster  D,  Nkx2.2  and  BMP/SMAD 
have  been  shown  to  promote  gliogenesis  (Lee  et al., 
2003;  Nakashima  et al.,  2001;  Fukuda  et al.,  2007).  In 
addition,  the  expression  of  truncated  tyrosine  kinase  B 
(trkB-t)  has  been  reported  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  the 
developmental  transition  from  neurogenesis  to  glio-
genesis  (Cheng et al.,  2006;  Climent et al.,  2000).  These 
reports  strongly  suggest  a  possible  association  of  the

upregulation  of  these  genes  (Nkx2.2,  BMP4,  Smad7, 
Ntrk-2)  with  gliogenic  differentiation  of  spinal  cord  pre-
cursor  cells. 
    Neurogenesis-related  genes  were  found  to  be  highly 
enriched  in  cluster  L,  which  showed  declining  upregula-
tion  patterns  along  the  differentiation  time.  In  particular, 
the  Neurod6  gene  was  upregulated  on  Days  2  and  4 
but  decreased  on  Day  8  in  our  experiments.  Neurod6, 
also  called  Nex,  Atoh2,  and  Math2,  is  a  member  of  the 
NeuroD  family  of  bHLH  transcription  factors  (Guo et al., 
2002)  and  is  a  critical  effector  of  the  nerve  growth  factor 
(NGF)  pathway  (Schwab et al.,  2000).  It  is  also  involved 
in  neuronal  differentiation  in  PC12  cells  and  may  be  one 
of  the  executors  of  neurogenic  function  of  Pax6  (Holm 
et al.,  2007).  It  has  been  reported  that  Pax6  may  be  in-

volved  in  the  neuronal  commitment  of  the  spinal  cord 
and  induces  the  expression  of  Ngn2,  a  proneuronal 
gene,  in  the  mouse  spinal  cord  (Scardigli  et al.,  2001). 
Robo2  and  Sema5a,  known  as  axon  guidance  mole-
cules  (Yue et al.,  2006;  Kantor et al.,  2004),  are  reported 
to  be  regulated  by  Pax6  function  (Jones  et al.,  2002; 

Jiménez  et al.,  2002).  Based  on  these  early  reports, 

Pax6-NeuroD6  and  its  downstream  signaling  seem  to 
have  important  roles  in  neurogenic  differentiation  of  the 
spinal  cord. 
    The  immunocytochemistry  study  in  the  earlier  section 
revealed  that  there  was  significant  differentiation  of  the 
astrocyte  on  Day  4.  But  the  expression  analysis  in  clus-
ter  D  showed  genes  involved  in  astrocyte  differentiation, 
such  as  Nkx2.2,  BMP,  Smad7,  and  NtrK-2,  on  Day  2  as 

well  as  on  Day  4.  This  observation  implies  the  existence 
of  a  repression  mechanism  of  astrocyte  differentiation  in 
the  early  stage  between  Day  2  and  Day  4.  It  was  also 
in  agreement  with  a  previous  report  in  which  Ngn1  was 
suggested  to  inhibit  astrocyte  differentiation  and  pro-
mote  neurogenesis  in  midgestational  NPCs  (Sun  et al., 
2001).  Any  significant  change  in  expression  of  Ngn1 
was  not  observed  in  the  experiment,  but  Neurod6,  one 
of  the  bHLH  factors,  showed  significantly  increased  ex-
pression  in  the  early  stage  of  differentiation.  To  confirm 
whether  neurod6  is  able  to  repress  astrocyte  differ-
entiation,  further  investigation  might  be  necessary.
  To  verify  the  expression  of  genes,  including  those 
mentioned  in  this  section,  5  selected  genes  (Lmo2, 
Nkx2.2,  BMP4,  Ncam2,  NeuroD6)  were  subjected  to 
semiquantitative  RT-PCR  analysis.  The  expression  pat-
tern  of  each  gene  was  consistent  with  the  results  of  the 
microarray  (Fig.  4). 

Computational  biomolecule  interaction  network 
analysis

For  a  better  understanding  of  the  underlying  mechanism 
of  spinal  cord  precursor  cell  differentiation,  a  biological 
interaction  network  was  constructed  using  the  Biomo-
lecular  Interaction  Network  Database  (BIND;  http://bond. 
unleashedinformatics.com/)  and  the  Biological  General 
Repository  for  Interaction  Datasets  (BIOGRID;  http:// 
www.thebiogrid.org/)  and  visualized  with  Cytoscape  v2.5 
open  source  software  (http://www.cytoscape.org).  The 
network  obtained  from  BIND  was  composed  of  2584 
edges  (interactions)  and  2054  nodes  (genes),  and  the 
network  from  BIOGRID  was  composed  of  658  inter-
actions  and  424  genes.  A  single  subnetwork  was  con-
structed  initially  by  mapping  both  differentially  ex-

in  red  and  green,  respectively.  Finally,  the  subnetworks 
containing  370,  435,  and  508  genes  were  identified  for 
differentiation  Day  2,  4,  and  8,  respectively  (Fig.  5).  As 
the  key  node  (gene)  among  these  genes,  we  identified 
2  genes,  neuro-oncological  ventral  antigen  1  (Nova1) 
and 
receptor  1 
(TGFBR1),  which  interact  with  more  than  9  proteins  in 
the  networks. 
    Nova1  is  reported  to  be  necessary  for  the  develop-
ment  of  the  motoneuron  and  for  control  of  the  alter-
native  splicing  of  pre-mRNA  involved  in  synapse  for-
mation  and  activity  (Ratti et al.,  2008).  Because  Nova1 
is  a  neuron-specific  splicing  factor,  the  genes  in  the  first 
neighbors  of  Nova1  were  expected  to  be  downregulated 
on  Day  8,  the  late  stage  of  neuronal  differentiation. 
However,  most  of  the  genes  in  the  first  neighbor  of 
Nova1  were  upregulated  in  a  time-dependent  manner 
along  the  differentiation  (Fig.  6A)  according  to  the  ex-
pression  analysis.  Meanwhile,  the  expression  of  6  genes 
(Sorcs3,  Purg,  Phactr1,  Fgd4,  Nrxn3,  and  Rap1gds1)  in 
clusters  10  and  12  were  found  to  be  slightly  decreased 
on  Day  8.  The  network  analysis  showed  that  Nova1  has 
direct  interactions  with  Pax6,  BTB,  and  CNC  homology 
2  (Bach2).  But  Pax6  and  Nova1  were  filtered  out  in  the 
process  of  DEG-finding  procedures,  when  we  performed 
semiquantitative  reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain 
reaction  (RT-PCR)  for  each  gene  to  check  the  ex-
pression  level  of  the  genes.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4,  the  ex-
pression  of  Pax6  significantly  decreased  on  Days  4  and 
8,  and  the  expression  of  Nova1  was  slightly  down-
regulated  on  Day  8.  The  network  analysis  indicated  that 
Nova1  may  play  a  pivotal  role  in  neuronal  development 
in  the  spinal  cord.

    The  number  of  upregulated  genes  that  connected 
with  another  node 
in  a 
time-dependent  manner,  through  the  differentiation  peri-
od  (Fig.  6B).  This  result  was  correlated  with  gene  ex-
pression  levels  monitored  by  RT-PCR  (Fig.  4).  Recent 
studies  have  shown  that  TGF-beta1/SMAD  signaling  in-
duces  astrocyte  fate  commitment  of  neuronal  precursor 
cells in vitro  (Stipursky  and  Gomes,  2007;  de  Sampaio 
e  Spohr  et al.,  2002).  These  observations  imply  that 
TGFBR1  has  important  roles  in  the  astrogenesis  of  spi-
nal  cord  precursor  cells.
    In  summary,  in  order  to  identify  genes  involved  in  reg-
ulatory  functions  of  the  differentiation  process,  we  ana-
lyzed  the  levels  of  whole  gene  expression  during  the  dif-
ferentiation  of  spinal  cord  NPCs.  We  identified  1878 
genes  whose  expression  levels  were  significantly  chang-
ed  during  differentiation  and  categorized  these  genes  in-
to  12  clusters  based  on  their  patterns  of  expression. 
Computational  analyses  on  biological  function  sug-
gested  that  the  Pax6-NeuroD6  pathways  may  be  im-
portant  in  the  generation  of  neurons  and  astrocytes.  The 
interaction  network  analysis  also  sheds  light  on  the  pos-
sible  pivotal  roles  of  Nova1  and  TGFbeta  in  neuro-
genesis  and  astrogenesis  in  the  mouse  spinal  cord, 
respectively.  In  particular,  further  molecular  studies  on 
Nova1  will  be  of  great  help  for  elucidating  the  under-
lying  regulation  mechanism  of  neurogenesis/astrogenesis 
of  NPCs.
