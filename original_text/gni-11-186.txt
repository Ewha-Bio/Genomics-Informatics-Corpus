The advances in electronic medical records (EMRs) and bioinformatics (BI) represent two significant trends in healthcare. The 
widespread adoption of EMR systems and the completion of the Human Genome Project developed the technologies for data 
acquisition, analysis, and visualization in two different domains. The massive amount of data from both clinical and biology 
domains is expected to provide personalized, preventive, and predictive healthcare services in the near future. The integrated 
use of EMR and BI data needs to consider four key informatics areas: data modeling, analytics, standardization, and privacy. 
Bioclinical  data  warehouses  integrating  heterogeneous  patient-related  clinical  or  omics  data  should  be  considered.  The 
representative  standardization  effort  by  the  Clinical  Bioinformatics  Ontology  (CBO)  aims  to  provide  uniquely  identified 
concepts to include molecular pathology terminologies. Since individual genome data are easily used to predict current and 
future health status, different safeguards to ensure confidentiality should be considered. In this paper, we focused on the 
informatics aspects of integrating the  EMR community and BI community by identifying opportunities, challenges, and 
approaches to provide the best possible care service for our patients and the population.

Introduction

The  development  of  electronic  medical  record  (EMR) 
systems began as a means to document clinical activities for 
in-patients and out-patients [1]. They have evolved as the 
primary  front-line  patient  care  clinical  tool  for  medical 
professionals. The completion of the Human Genome Pro-
ject opened the era of research in genomics and proteomics. 
Genome  research  provides  keys  to  understanding  the 
mechanisms  of  disease.  In  clinical  informatics,  the  wide-
spread  adoption  of  the  EMR  system  has  generated  large 
amounts of heterogeneous clinical data－some structured 
and  others  unstructured.  In  addition,  the  explosive 
health-related  contents  from  online  communities,  mobile 
applications,  and  electronic  personal  health  records  in-

creased the availability of non-traditional data on individual 
activities and life style [2]. In genetics, since the completion 
of  the  Human  Genome  Project  in  2003,  the  acquisition, 
analysis, and presentation of whole-genomic data has be-
come faster, cheaper, and more reliable day by day [3]. Such 
dramatic technological advances affect the development of 
new  prevention,  diagnosis,  and  treatment  patterns  for 
routine clinical care. The massive amount of heterogeneous 
data  from  two  different  domains  is  expected  to  provide 
personalized, preventive, and predictive healthcare services 
in the near future [4].

Integrated use of EMR and bioinformatics is beginning to 
influence  the  changes  in  the  research  paradigm－that  is, 
rapid introduction of new concepts into the point of care. Dr.

of  “the  clinical  application  of  bioinformatics-associated 
sciences and technologies to understand molecular mecha-
nisms and potential therapies for human disease” [5]. CBI 
aims to deal with the challenge of integrating genomic and 
clinical data to accelerate the translation of knowledge into 
effective  treatment  plan  development  and  personalized 
prescription. It is to assist clinicians in various ways, inclu-
ding  new  biomarker  discovery,  identification  of  genotype 
and phenotype correlations, and pharmacogenomics at the 
point of care. 

Biomedical informatics is a more popular term. Biome-
dical  informatics  is  defined  as  an  emerging,  multi-dis-
ciplinary field, and it is the integration of the computational 
methods  and  diverse  technologies  used  in  life  science 
research,  such  as  genomics,  proteomics,  systems  biology, 
computer  sciences,  and  healthcare  applications,  such  as 
electronic health records (EHRs) [6]. The adoption of EMRs 
enables  one  to  conduct  comprehensive  phenotypic-geno-
typic association studies using the genotypes obtained from 
whole genome sequencing  of a given cohort in combination 
with the phenome data of the same population, as available 
in the EMR database, as shown in Fig. 1.

The major challenge in enabling such convergent research 
is to provide easy storage, user-friendly visualization, speedy 
analysis, knowledge generation, and presentation of clini-
cally  relevant  information  at  the  point  of  care.  Relevant 
information  should  be  extracted  and  linked  with  medical 
records in a clinically applicable manner. The convergence of 
discovery research for clinical implementation can only be 
accomplished through stringent data management, analysis, 
interpretation, and quantification in a multidisciplinary re-
search environment. In addition, since genetic information 
can be easily identifiable, ethical issues, such as informed 
consent and stewardship over this database, also should be 
considered as the data grow. The communities of EMRs and 
bioinformatics (BI) have different histories. While the EMR 
community focused on clinical activities and clinical work-
flows,  the  BI  community  originated  from  the  biological 
research community, which included physicists, computer 
scientists, statisticians, and clinical researchers. What are 
the optimal ways to integrate the tremendous advances in BI 
into routine clinical work? In this paper, we will primarily 
focus on the informatics aspects of this large question by 
identifying  opportunities,  challenges,  and  approaches  for 
the ultimate goal of providing the best care possible for our 
patients and the population.

Recent Projects Using Bio-enabled EHR

A  number of research projects using large-scale health 
record datasets have been conducted in various communities 
around the globe. For example, the NSF BIGDATA program 
solicitation (http://www.nsf.gov), which is partially funded 
by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), includes large- 
scale  data  collection  and  analysis.  This  program  aims  to 
advance  the  core  scientific  and  technological  means  of 
managing,  analyzing,  visualizing,  and  extracting  useful 
information  from  large,  diverse,  distributed,  and  hetero-
geneous datasets. 

INBIOMEDvision  (http://www.inbiomedvision.eu)  is  a 
two-year initiative funded by the European Commission 7th 
Framework  Program  of  Information  and  Communication 
Technologies  (ICT),  with  the  aim  of  bridging  the  com-
munities of bioinformatics and medical informatics. It is a 
coordination  support  action  (FP7)  that  has  the  aim  of 
promoting biomedical informatics by means of permanent 
monitoring  of  the  scientific  state-of-the-art  and  existing 
activities in the theme, execution of prospective analyses on 
the  emerging  challenges  and  opportunities,  and  dissemi-
nation of knowledge in the field [7].

The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) 
Network  is  a  national  consortium  organized  by  National 
Human  Genome  Research  Institute  (NHGRI) to  develop,

disseminate, and apply approaches to research. It combines 
DNA  biorepositories  with  EMR  systems  for  large-scale, 
high-throughput genetic research with the ultimate goal of 
returning genomic testing results to patients in a clinical care 
setting.  The  network  is  currently  exploring  more  than  a 
dozen phenotypes (with 13 additional electronic algorithms 
having already been published). Various models of returning 
clinical results have been implemented or planned for pilot 
at  sites  across  the  network.  Themes  of  bioinformatics, 
genomic medicine, privacy, and community engagement are 
of particular relevance to eMERGE [8].

In addition to nationwide collaboration projects, there is a 
research project using large-scale EHRs. Hanauer et al. [9] 
used large-scale, longitudinal EHR data to conduct research 
on associations of medical diagnoses and to explore patterns 
of specific disease progression. Lin et al. [10] proposed a 
symptom-disease treatment (SDT) association rule, mining 
a comprehensive EHR of approximately 2.1 million records 
from  a  major  hospital.  Based  on  selected  International 
Classification of Disease (ICD-9) codes, they were able to 
identify  clinically  relevant  and  accurate  SDT  associations 
from patient records in seven distinct diseases, ranging from 
cancers to chronic and infectious diseases. 

Challenges for Genome-Enabled EMR

Research  combining  biology  and  clinical  information 
must  address  “the  storage,  retrieval,  analysis,  and  disse-
mination of molecular information in a clinical setting,” as 
suggested by the America Medical Informatics Association 
(AMIA)-initiated genomics working group [11]. The AMIA 
proposed  specific  areas  as  follows:  1)  development  of  a 
database  structure  to  unify  clinical  and  genomic  data,  2) 
connecting biology information with patient health records, 
3)  development  of  a  genome-enabled  EMR  system,  4) 
linking  clinical  trial  and  drug  discovery  information,  5) 
supporting the development benchmark clinical/molecular 
datasets, 6) developing clinical decision-support tools utili-
zing molecular information, and 7) visualizing and modeling 
the molecular basis of disease.

The  major  challenge  is  how  to  integrate  the  hetero-
geneous data into one database system. Should there be a 
single database or should one consider a federated model? 
Furthermore, one should consider various cases by various 
users,  which  would  determine  the  overall  system  archi-
tecture. It is not possible to move large amounts of genomic 
data. Then, how and where should the high-intensity com-
putation be managed? The expected raw sequencing data for 
one  person  is  approximately  4  terabytes.  The  integrated 
database  can  have  a  potential  impact  on  the  prevention, 
diagnosis,  and  treatment  of  disease.  To  make  this  desire 

come true, it is important to connect genomics data with 
clinical information. Genetic test results are already used to 
assess  the  risk  of  breast  cancer  patients,  determine  the 
potential  adverse  drug  reactions  on  individual  patient 
metabolism, and identify treatment plans for cancers. Ge-
netic test results have suggested a diagnosis for patients with 
neuropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, and Proteus syn-
drome and have guided therapeutic care for patients with 
arterial  calcifications,  movement  disorders,  and  Miller 
syndrome [12-17]. The number of applications of genomics 
in diagnosing diseases and guiding treatment procedures in 
the clinic will continue to increase. 

Key Informatics Issues to Consider

The integrated use of EMR and BI data needs to consider 
four key informatics areas: data modeling, analytics, stan-
dardization, and privacy.

Data modeling and data warehouse

Data  modeling  and  warehouse  are  two  key  concepts 
within proper systems architecture for medicine and bioin-
formatics. The first generation of clinical data warehouses 
(CDWs) is mostly stored in commercial relational database 
management systems and collects structured contents, and 
the  healthcare  community  has  developed  a  large  clinical 
database,  which  is  called  the  CDW  [18].  The  extraction, 
transformation,  and  load  is  essential  for  converting  and 
integrating  distributed  healthcare  data.  Ad  hoc  reporting 
tools using online analytical processing technology are used 
to  gain  intuitive  and  simple  analysis  results  in  clinical 
informatics. 

Bioclinical data warehouses that integrate heterogeneous 
patient-related clinical or omics data should be considered. 
Applications  analyzing  bioclinical  data  warehouses  will 
include  genetic  epidemiology  and  evaluation  of  decision- 
support systems before production systems.

In less than a decade, the Human Genome Project has 
been established to generate a large amount of biological 
data to practice diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics 
[19]. The central products using standardized data model 
are  GenBank  [20],  SWISS-PROT  [21],  Exon-Intron  [22], 
and IMGT [23].

However,  standardized  data  models  for  integrated 
bioclinical data warehouses have not been developed yet. 
This area will be important to allow researchers to rapidly 
spread  information  throughout  the  world  and  inspire 
thousands of research projects. 

The  experience  in  designing  storages  for  digital  radio-
logical imaging, also known as picture archiving and com-
munication system (PACS), may provide some guidance in 

188

bioinformatics data warehouses. In PACS, one has multiple 
image  storages  that  are  not  necessarily  part  of  EMR; 
however, the diagnostic reports are part of the EMR. The 
PACS  images  are  then  made  available  to  physicians  as 
needed.

Analytics 

The analytics technology that is commonly used for these 
systems  is  mainly  traditional  data  mining  techniques 
developed  in  the  1980s.  The  popular  term  of  analysis 
technology  in  the  business  and  computer  science  com-
munities in the 1990s was business intelligence. Recently, 
technologies that require advanced and unique data storage, 
management, analysis, and visualization became important 
in applications that are very large and complex databases. 

Standardization

The lack of standardized vocabularies for clinical infor-
matics has hampered the development of automated clinical 
decision  support  systems.  Finding  the  laboratory  term 
representing the same meaning of serum sodium for dif-
ferent database systems is troublesome in multi-center data 
integration. The National Library of Medicine has developed 
the  Unified  Medical  Language  System  (UMLS)  to  enable 
these  different  vocabularies  to  be  interoperable  by  deve-
loping a vocabulary at least at a basic level [24]. The same 
problems are known in bioinformatics. DNA sequences have 
different names and are joined in some databases only with 
varying levels of confidence. Codification of molecular diag-
nostic or cytogenetic results using existing medical voca-
bularies will have difficulties due to a lack of sufficient terms 
for molecular findings. For example, the Systematic Nomen-
clature of Medicine (SNOMED) has minimal codes related 
to  the  description  of  molecular  diagnostic  findings.  The 
Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) 
vocabulary  has  recently  added  a  significant  number  of 
molecular  pathology  terms;  however,  it  lacks  the  rich 
context-defining  relationships  provided  by  ontology  [24]. 
The Clinical Bioinformatics Ontology (CBO) addresses this 
gap  by  providing  uniquely  identified  concepts  related  to 
clinically significant molecular findings. The CBO consists of 
nearly 7,000 concepts, each of which is associated with a 
global unique identifier, and is associated with more than 
15,500 relationships [25-27]. As the efforts to integrate two 
different domains are increased, vocabulary issues will be 
essential. 

Privacy

Individual genomic data are easily identifiable and can be 
used  to  predict  current  and  future  health  status.  Thus, 
extracting  knowledge  from  large  health  data  employs  a 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

significant risk of privacy information breach; thus, resear-
chers  need  to  consider  Health  Insurance  Portability  and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)  requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and 
trustworthy  database  infrastructure  and  conducting  re-
search  [28].  When  personal  genetics  data  can  be  incor-
porated into EMR systems, different safeguards to ensure 
confidentiality  will  be  required.  A  de-identified  bio-data 
warehouse combining traditional clinical and genomic infor-
mation will be essential to conduct translational research. 

Era of Open Global Collaboration

One major difference between the EMR community and 
BI  community  is  the  degree  of  multidisciplinary  open 
collaboration. In EMRs, multidisciplinary collaborative ef-
forts have been limited. Most of the EMR systems in use 
today are based on proprietary software that hampers data 
exchange with other systems. In the BI community, global 
collaboration, aided by wide use of open source software and 
development methodologies, has been a key success factor. 
The  BI  community  has  been  global  in  scope  from  the 
beginning,  and  information  sharing  and  free  exchange  of 
software  tools  have  ushered  in  the  era  of  open  source 
software in health informatics. There is a great need for the 
EMR  community  to  adopt  more  open  source  software 
methodologies that would allow rapid global collaboration 
(http://www.osehra.org).

Conclusion

Genomic technologies hold the potential to improve the 
diagnosis and treatment of inherited and complex diseases
－including  cancer－and  facilitate  the  move  towards  per-
sonalized predictive medicine. The higher throughput and 
rapidly  falling  costs  of  next-generation  sequencing  have 
resulted  in  voluminous  genomic  data  and  downstream 
computational challenges. Thus, the shift from this powerful 
discovery research to clinical implementation can only be 
accomplished  with  careful  integration  with  EMRs,  a 
frontline patient care tool. The most prominent reason to 
integrate clinical information and biology information under 
the  same  system  is  to  provide  opportunities  for  bi-direc-
tional exchange of data, technology, and knowledge between 
two  disciplines  with  different  histories  and  cultures. 
Additionally,  open  global  cooperation will provide oppor-
tunities to make rapid progress in understanding, treating, 
and preventing human diseases.
