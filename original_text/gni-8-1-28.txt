Abstract

Increased  exposure  of  human  to  RF  fields  has  raised 
concerns  for  its  potential  adverse  effects  on  our  health. 
To  address  the  biological  effects  of  RF  radiation,  we 
used  genome  wide  gene  expression  as  the  indicator. 
We  exposed  normal  WI-38  human  fibroblast  cells  to 
1763  MHz  mobile  phone  RF  radiation  at  a  specific  ab-
sorption  rate  (SAR)  of  60  W/kg  with  an  operating  cool-
ing  system  for  24  h.  There  were  no  alterations  in  cell 
numbers  or  morphology  after  RF  exposure.  Through  mi-
croarray  analysis,  we  identified  no  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes  (DEGs)  at  the  0.05  significance  level  after 
controlling  for  multiple  testing  errors  with  the  Benjamini- 
ochberg 
(BH  FDR)  method. 
Meanwhile,  82  genes  were  differentially  expressed  be-
tween  RF-exposed  cells  and  controls  when  the  sig-
nificance  level  was  set  at  0.01  without  correction  for 
multiple  comparisons.  We  found  that  24  genes  (0.08% 
of  the  total  genes  examined)  were  changed  by  more 
than  1.5-fold  on  RF  exposure.  However,  significant  en-
richment  of  any  gene  set  or  pathway  was  not  observed 
from  the  functional  annotation  analysis.  From  these  re-
sults,  we  did  not  find  any  evidence  that  non-thermal  RF 
radiation  at  a  60-W/kg  SAR  significantly  affects  cell  pro-
liferation  or  gene  expression  in  WI-38  cells.

Introduction

Recent  advances  in  mobile  phone  technology  have  led 
to  exponential  use  of  mobile  phone  communication 
around  the  world.  This  increasing  exposure  of  human  to 
RF  fields  has  raised  concerns  for  its  potential  adverse 
effects  on  our  health.  It  is  clear  that  ionizing  radiation, 
such  as  X-ray,  affects  biological  systems,  while  it  is  still

unclear  and  inconclusive  whether  non  ionizing  low-en-
ergy  RF  radiation  could  have  effects  on  them.  Although 
there  have  been  a  lot  of  studies  of  RF  effects  on  bio-
logical  systems  for  various  aspects,  most  of  them  have 
focused  on  stress  proteins,  such  as  HSP,  and  MAPK 
(Belyaev  et  al.,  2006; 
signaling  or  DNA  damages 
Chauhan  et al.,  2006;  Friedman  et al.,  2007;  Huang  et 
al.,  2008;  Lee  et  al.,  2006;  Sanchez  et  al.,  2007; 
Sanchez  et al.,  2008,  Verschaeve  et al.,  2009).  For  in-
stance,  Friedman  et al.  (2007)  found  that  exposure  of 
HeLa  and  Rat1  cells  to  875  MHz  RF  radiation  induces 
the  activation  of  the  ERK  cascade  through  ROS  gen-
eration  via  NADH  oxidase  but  not  that  of  JNKs  or  p38 
MAPKs.  However,  we  previously  reported  that  the  phos-
phorylation  of  MAPKs  (ERK,  JNK,  and  p38)  did  not 
change  after  exposure  of  auditory  hair  cells  to  1763 
MHz  at  a  20-W/kg  SAR  for  up  to  2  h  (Huang  et al., 
2008).
    However,  RF  radiation  can  affect  not  only  specific 
genes  but  also  whole  genome.  If  RF  radiation  exposure 
induces  any  biological  effects  in  human,  it  must  change 
cell  behavior  and  gene  expression  (McNamee  et al., 
2009;  Vanderstraeten et al.,  2008).  To  date,  some  micro-
array  analyses  have  been  performed  to  elucidate  the  ef-
fects  of  RF  radiation  on  biological  systems  (Chauhan et 
al.,  2007;  Huang  et al.,  2008;  Lee  et al.,  2006;  Lee  et 
al.,  2007;  Paparini  et al.,  2009;  Qutob  et al.,  2006; 
Sanchez  et al.,  2007;  Whitehead  et al.,  2006;  Zeng  et 
al.,  2006;  Zhao et al.,  2007).  For  example,  non-thermal 
RF  radiation  did  not  affect  gene  expression  in  U87MG 
glioblastoma  cells  exposed  to  1.9  GHz  RF  at  SARs  from 
0.1  to  10  W/kg  for  4  h  and  24  h,  respectively  (Qutob 
et al.,  2006;  Chauhan et al.,  2007).  It  has  been  reported 
that  analysis  of  gene  expression  identified  a  handful  of 
consistently  changed  genes  in  MCF-7  cells  after  ex-
posure  to  RF  radiation  at  a  low  SAR  (up  to  3.5  W/kg) 
for  24  h.  However,  these  differentially  expressed  genes 
were  not  confirmed  by  quantitative  RT-PCR,  implying 
that  the  observed  effects  might  have  occurred  by 
chance  (Zeng  et al.,  2006).  Similarly,  RF  exposure  to 
C3H  10T  1/2  cells  at  a  5-W/kg  SAR  induced  no  greater 
changes  in  gene  expression  compared  to  the  sham 
group  (Whitehead  et al.,  2006).  In  addition,  we  pre-
viously  reported  unchangeability  in  the  phosphorylation 
of  MAPKs,  such  as  ERK,  JNK,  and  p38,  after  exposure 
of  auditory  hair  cells  to  1,763  MHz  at  a  20-W/kg  SAR 
for  up  to  2  h.  Moreover,  neither  any  cell  cycle  change 
nor  DNA  damage  was  detected  under  these  conditions. 

Meanwhile,  a  genome  wide  analysis  of  gene  expression 
indicated  that  some  genes,  including  cytokine  receptor 
genes,  were  downregulated  upon  RF  radiation,  but  they 
were  not  directly  related  to  cell  proliferation  or  DNA 
damage  responses  (Huang  et al.,  2008). 
    Although  most  studies  on  the  biological  effects  of  RF 
exposure  could  not  detect  any  molecular  changes, 
some  reports  demonstrated  RF-specific  gene  expression 
(Belyaev  et al.,  2006;  Lee  et al.,  2005;  Nylund  et al., 
2006).  For  example,  Lee  et al.  (2005)  used  the  serial 
analysis  of  gene  expression  (SAGE)  technique  and  found 
that  2.45  GHz  RF  radiation  at  a  10-W/kg  SAR  for  2∼6 
h  affected  the  expression  of  221  genes,  including  apop-
tosis-related  genes  and  cell  cycle  genes,  in  human 
HL-60  cells  without  a  significant  increase  of  HSP 
expression.  Nylund  et al.  (2006)  reported  that  two  var-
iants  of  a  human  endothelial  cell  line  responded  differ-
ently  to  900  MHz  GSM  signal  mobile  phone  radiation 
(Nylund et al.,  2006).  With  regard  to  the  effect  of  RF  ex-
posure  to  rat  brain,  Belyaev  et al.  (2006)  reported  that 
GSM  at  915  MHz  induced  no  detectable  DNA  dou-
ble-stranded  breaks  or  changes  in  chromatin  con-
formation  but  affected  the  expression  of  genes  related 
to  neurotransmitter  regulation,  blood  brain  barrier,  and 
melatonin  production  in  rat  brain  cells.  Taken  together, 
this  evidence  is  controversial  and  not  reproducible,  al-
though  we  could  consider  that  different  biological  sam-
ples  and  different  species  might  respond  differently  to 
RF  radiation.  To  assess  the  biological  effect  of  RF  radia-
tion,  most  studies  using  microarray  have  applied  rela-
tively  low  SARs  (0.1∼20  W/kg)  to  cancer  cells  or 
tissues. 
    In  this  study,  we  tried  to  use  genome  wide  gene  ex-
pression  as  the  indicator  to  assess  the  biological  effect 
of  RF  radiation  at  high  SARs.  We  exposed  normal  WI-38 
human  fibroblast  cells  to  1,763  MHz  RF  radiation  at  a 
60-W/kg  SAR  for  24  h  and  performed  microarray  to  an-
alyze  the  genome  wide  response  to  RF  radiation. 

Methods

Cell  culture 

Normal  WI-38  human  lung  fibroblast  cells  were  pur-
chased  from  ATCC  and  grown  in  DMEM  (Wellgene, 
Korea),  supplemented  with  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal 
bovine  serum  (FBS),  100  mg/ml  streptomycin,  and  100 
U/ml  penicillin  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA),  at  37oC 
in  a  5%  CO2  incubator.  The  cells  from  passage  18  to 
21  were  used  for  this  study.  Morphological  changes  in 
the  cells  were  observed  under  a  phase  contrast  micro-
scope  (magnification  100X),  and  cell  numbers  were 
checked  using  a  hemocytometer.

Genome-wide  Response  to  Radiofrequency  Radiation    29

Radiofrequency  (RF)  radiation  exposure  system

The  conditions  for  RF  exposure  were  described  in  a 
previous  study  (Lee  et al.,  2006).  Briefly,  a  real  Code 
Domain  Multiple  Access  (CDMA)  signal  at  1,762.5  MHz 
was  applied  for  RF  exposure.  The  exposure  system  was 
first  equilibrated  for  2  h,  and  WI-38  cells  in  a  100-mm 
culture  dish  containing  18  ml  of  growth  medium  were 
exposed  at  SAR  values  of  60  W  per  kg  for  24  h  with 
the  operating  cooling  system.  Before  and  after  radiation 
exposure,  the  temperature  of  each  sample  was  mea-
sured.  All  exposures  were  performed  in  triplicate  in-
dependently.  Cells  were  immediately  harvested  and 
processed  for  further  analysis.  Unexposed  cells  were  al-
so  divided  separately  and  cultured  at  37oC  in  a  5%  CO2 
incubator  as  a  control  (n=3).

RNA  extraction  and  Affymetrix  gene  chip  proc-
essing

Total  RNA  was  extracted  by  using  the  Qiagen  RNeasy 
Mini  kit.  (Qiagen  GmbH,  Hilden,  Germany).  The  purity 
and  concentration  of  RNA  were  determined  by  a 
NanoDrop  spectrophotometer  (NanoDrop  Technologies, 
Wilmington,  DE,  USA)  and  Agilent  Bioanalyzer  (Agilent 
Technologies,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA).  The  RNA  was  am-
plified  and  labeled  according  to  the  Affymetrix  GeneChip 
Whole  Transcript  (WT)  Sense  Target  Labeling  protocol. 
The  resulting  labeled  cDNA  was  hybridized  to  Affymetrix 
Human  Gene  1.0  ST  arrays  and  scanned.  The  scanned 
raw  expression  values  were  background-corrected,  nor-
malized,  and  summarized  using  the  RMA  approach  in 
the  Bioconductor  “affy”  package.  The  resulting  log2- 
transformed  data  were  used  for  further  analyses.

Identification  of  differentially  expressed  genes 
(DEGs)

A  nonspecific  filtering  was  performed  to  remove  the 
noninformative  probe  sets  with  low  variability,  because 
these  probe  sets  may  lack  the  sensitivity  for  us  to  infer 
differential  expression.  Only  the  probe  sets  that  had  a 
standard  deviation  above  the  value  of  shorth  (the  mean 
of  the  shortest  interval  containing  half  of  the  data)  were 
included.  Differentially  expressed  probe  sets  were  identi-
fied  using  linear  models  of  the  “limma”  package  from 
Bioconductor,  applying  the  moderated  t-statistics  based 
on  an  empirical  Bayes  approach.  Comparisons  were 
made  between  two  groups:  three  replicates  that  were 
exposed  to  1,763  MHz  RF  at  an  SAR  of  60  W/kg  for  24 
hours  and  three  controls  without  RF  exposure.  The 
Benjamini-Hochberg  false  discovery  rate-adjusted  p  val-
ue  (BH  FDR  p  value)  was  used  for  correction  of  multiple

(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov)  were  used  to  detect  over-

Results  and  Discussion

To  understand  the  biological  effect  of  RF  radiation,  we 
exposed  WI-38  cells  to  1,763  MHz  RF  at  a  high  SAR  of 
60  W/kg  for  24  hours  with  an  operating  cooling  system. 
We  recorded  the  output  of  the  RF  exposure  system  and 
also  measured  the  temperature  of  the  medium  for  each 
sample  right  after  RF  exposure.  Even  though  there  were 
some  variations  in  SAR,  RF  radiation  was  almost  con-
stantly  maintained  for  24  hours  (Fig.  1A).  No  significant 
changes  were  examined  between  RF-exposed  cells  and 
unexposed  cells  in  cell  number  or  morphology  (Fig.  1B 
and  C).
    In  the  next  step,  we  performed  microarray,  covering 
28,869  genes,  with  the  samples  above  to  check  the  ge-
nome-wide  gene  expression.  No  significant  DEGs  were 
identified  at  the  0.05  significance  level  after  controlling 
for  multiple  testing  errors  with  the  BH  FDR  method,  im-
plying  that  no  statistically  significant  change  was  in-
duced  by  RF  exposure  when  the  increase  in  temper-
ature  by  RF  was  effectively  regulated  at  37oC.  When  the 
significance  level  was  set  at  0.01  without  correction  for 
multiple  comparisons,  82  genes  appeared  to  be  differ-
entially  expressed  between  RF-exposed  cells  and  con-
trols;  however,  the  smallest  FDR-corrected  p-value  was 

0.64  (data  not  shown).  Table  1  presents  a  list  of  24 
genes,  including  developmental  pluripotency-associated 
3  (DPPA3)  and  complement  component  5  (C5),  with 
p-value  ＜0.01  and  fold-change  ≥1.5,  showing  that  the 
differential  expression  was  not  statistically  significant 
because  the  FDR-corrected  p-values  for  most  genes 
were  1.00.  Furthermore,  we  did  not  recognize  any  stat-
istically  significantly  enriched  gene  sets  or  pathways 
from  the  functional  annotation  analysis  with  82  tran-
scripts. 
    In  the  present  study,  we  applied  RF  radiation  at  a 
high  SAR  value  to  cells,  but  we  did  not  observe  sig-
nificant  changes  in  cell  numbers  or  morphology.  Also, 
we  found  that  24  genes  (0.08%  of  total  genes  exam-
ined)  were  changed  by  more  than  1.5-fold  on  RF 
exposure.  These  results  were  similar  with  those  of  our 
previous  studies,  because  there  were  no  significant 
changes  in  cell  cycle  in  auditory  hair  cells  or  Jurkat  T 
cells  after  exposure  to  1,763  MHz  at  a  10-  or  20-W/kg 
SAR,  respectively,  for  up  to  48  h.  In  addition,  even 
though  some  genes,  including  cytokine  receptor  genes, 
were  down-regulated  upon  RF  radiation,  they  were  not 
directly  related  to  cell  proliferation,  and  also,  29  genes 
that  were  changed  on  RF  exposure  represented  just 
0.09%  of  the  total  genes  examined  in  the  microarray 
(Huang et al.,  2008).  In  this  study,  we  used  a  different 
cell  line  and  RF  radiation  dosage,  as  well  as  RF  ex-
posure  duration,  from  a  previous  study,  but  there  were 
no  significant  alterations  in  gene  expression  or  cell  pro-

liferation  between  RF-exposed  cells  and  control  cells. 
Moreover,  the  functional  annotation  analysis  with  82 
genes  showed  no  gene  sets  or  pathways  that  were  sig-
nificantly  enriched,  suggesting  that  these  genes  might 
not  specifically  but  randomly  respond  to  RF  radiation  by 
chance.  Our  finding  is  also  consistent  with  the  other  re-
ports  that  non-thermal  RF  fields  did  not  affect  gene  ex-
pression  in  a  human  glioblastoma  cell  line,  U87MG,  or 
mouse  whole  brain  (Paparini et al.,  2009;  Qutob et al., 
2006).  Takashima et al.  (2006)  also  found  no  changes  in 
cell  proliferation  with  continuous  exposure  at  up  to  100 
W/kg  at  physiological  temperature.  Recently  Paparini et 
al.  (2009)  showed  that  when  less  stringent  constraints 
were  adopted  to  analyze  the  microarray  data,  75  genes 
were  changed  following  GSM  1,800  MHz  exposure. 
However,  these  genes  were  not  confirmed  by  q  RT- 
PCR,  implicating  that  there  was  no  consistent  change  in 
gene  expression  of  whole  mouse  brain  upon  RF 
exposure.  Among  the  75  genes,  there  were  no  shared 
genes  with  our  24  genes,  although  there  were  differ-
ences  in  biological  samples,  applied  RF  radiation,  and 
exposure  duration.
    Since  we  maintained  the  temperature  of  the  media  at 

the  physiological  range  and  heat  shock  proteins  did  not 
change  upon  RF  exposure,  our  results  suggest  that 
non-thermal  RF  radiation  may  not  affect  cell  proliferation 
or  gene  expression,  unlike  thermal  RF  radiation.  With  re-
gard  to  the  thermal  effect  of  RF  radiation,  a  comparison 
of  cellular  responses  to  thermal  RF  radiation  and  heat 
shock  may  be  useful  to  understand  the  characteristics 
of  each  stressor  at  the  genomic  level.  Moreover,  it  may 
be  interesting  to  assess  whether  the  cellular  response  to 
thermal  RF  radiation  may  be  different  from  other  stres-
sors,  such  as  UV  and  ionizing  radiation.
    There  are  several  limitations  of  our  study.  First,  we 
did  not  examine  some  possible  effects  that  might  ap-
pear  in  prolonged  periods  of  recovery  time  (i.e.,  48  or 
72  hrs  after  exposure),  which  can  be  performed  in  a  fu-
ture  study  to  ensure  that  non-thermal  RF  radiation  does 
not  affect  cell  proliferation.  Second,  we  did  not  inves-
tigate  the  effects  of  RF  in  a  dose-dependent  manner, 
varying  the  exposure  time  and  SAR  value.  However,  the 
experimental  condition  used  here  was  one  of  the  ex-
treme  conditions  that  were  employed  in  many  previous 
studies  (McNamee et al.,  2009).  Another  limitation  of  our 
study  is  that  we  examined  the  effect  of  RF  radiation  in 

32    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(1)  28-33,  March  2010

only  one  normal  cell  line,  which  does  not  necessarily 
imply  that  the  same  result  will  be  obtained  in  other  nor-
mal  cells.  Thus,  further  investigation  in  various  normal 
cell  lines  will  provide  a  fuller  understanding  of  the  effect 
of  RF  in  humans.
