Abstract

Closely  related  species  share  large  genomic  segments 
called  syntenic  regions,  where  the  genomic  elements 
such  as  genes  are  arranged  co-linearly  among  the 
species.  While  synteny  is  an  important  criteria  in  estab-
lishing  orthologous  regions  between  species,  non-syn-
tenic  regions  may  display  species-specific  features.  As 
the  first  step  in  cataloging  human-  or  primate-  specific 
genomic  elements,  we  surveyed  human  genomic  regions 
that  are  not  syntenic  with  any  other  non-primate  mam-
malian  genomes  sequenced  so  far.  Based  on  the  data 
compiled  in  Ensembl  databases,  we  were  able  to  identi-
fy  10  such  regions  located  in  eight  different  human 
chromosomes.  Interestingly,  most  of  these  highly  hu-
man-  or  primate-  specific  loci  are  concentrated  in  sub-
telomeric  or  pericentromeric  regions.  It  has  been  re-
ported  that  subtelomeric  regions  in  human  chromo-
somes  are  highly  plastic  and  filled  with  recently  shuffled 
genomic  elements.  Pericentromeric  regions  also  show  a 
great  deal  of  segmental  duplications.  Such  genomic  re-
arrangements  may  have  caused  these  large  human-  or 
primate-  specific  genome  segments.

Introduction

Closely  related  species  that  have  diverged  relatively  re-
cently,  share  large  genome  segments  that  show  co-line-
arly  arranged  genomic  features  such  as  genes.  These 
regions  are  said  in  synteny.  For  example,  mammals 
share  a  great  deal  of  syntenic  regions,  implying  di-
vergence  from  a  common  ancestral  genome  (Bourque, 
2004).  Often  a  genomic  segment  in  a  chromosome  of  a 
species  is  split  into  two  different  chromosomes  in  an-
other  species  (Peng,  2006).  It  was  also  observed  that 
the  synteny  break  points  were  conserved  among  the 
species,  allowing  reconstruction  of  the  ancestral  chro-

mosomes  (Murphy,  2005).  Since  synteny  blocks  have  in-
herited  from  a  common  ancestor  through  genome  re-
arrangement  and  the  genes  in  a  syntenic  block  are  in 
the  same  order,  synteny  plays  a  critical  role  in  identify-
ing  orthologs  between  closely  related  species.  On  the 
other  hand,  non-syntenic  regions  would  show  species- 
specific  features  that  are  due  to  genome  rearrangement. 
Since  several  mammalian  genome  sequences  are  avail-
able  now  (Rhead,  2010),  we  may  identify  regions  of  a 
species  that  are  not  syntenic  with  any  other  species. 
These  regions  would  be  highly  specific  to  the  species  of 
interest.  Ensembl  Genome  Browser  hosts  a  number  of 
sequenced  whole  genomes  and  provides  information  on 
syntenic  regions  (Flicek,  2010).  Since  the  comparison  of 
human  and  chimpanzee  genome  sequences  showed  no 
noticeable  non-syntenic  regions  caused  by  genome  re-
arrangements  (CSAC,  2005),  we  focused  on  the  com-
parison  of  the  human  genome  versus  all  the  other 
non-primate  mammalian  genomes.  Using 
the  data 
downloaded  from  Ensembl  database,  we  cataloged  the 
genomic  regions  that  were  not  syntenic  with  any  other 
non-primate  mammalian  genomes.  Here  we  report  how 
many  such  regions  exist  in  human  genome,  and  how 
they  are  distributed  among  the  chromosomes  and  re-
gionally  within  a  given  chromosome.

Methods

Cataloging  syntenic  regions

Our  definition  of  synteny between  a  pair  of genomes  was 
based  on  the  working  principle  used  by  Ensembl  Genome 
Browser (http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/compara/analyses. 
html).  Ensembl  filters  the  result  of  blastZ  (Schwartz, 
2003)  runs  between  a  pair  of  genomes  by  chaining  the 
aligned  blocks  into  bigger  nets  using  blastZ-net,  fol-
lowed  by  grouping  neighboring  regions  closer  than 
200kb.  The  final  syntenic  regions  are  defined  by  merg-
ing  those  grouped  regions  if  they  are  not  interrupted  by 
non-syntenic  blocks.  The  resulting  synteny  data  files 
(dnafrag.txt,  dnafrag_region.txt,  genome_db.txt,  meth-
od_line.txt,  method_link_species_set.txt,  and  synteny_re-
gion.txt)  are  downloadable  from  Ensembl  ftp  site  (ftp:// 
ftp.ensembl.org/pub/).  We  made  a  synteny  database 
from  these  six  files  using  MySQL  database  management 
system.  This  database  includes  10  mammalian  species 
(Rattus norvegicus, Macaca mulatta, Pan troglodytes, 
Canis familiaris, Monodelphis domestica, Mus musculus, 
Pongo pygmaeus, Equus caballus, Bos Taurus, and 

Homo sapiens).  Since  we  concerned  human-specific 
features  not  shared  with  other  non-primate  mammals, 
we  excluded  non-human  primates  and  used  the  remain-
ing  six  genomes.  The  pair-wise  synteny  information  be-
tween  human  and  each  of  the  other  species  was  saved 
in  BED  format  (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat. 
html#format1).

Inferring  non-syntenic  regions

In  order  to  identify  human  genome  regions  that  are  not 
synteny  with  any  other  non-primate  mammalian  species, 
the  synteny  regions  saved  in  the  previous  step  were 
masked  from  the  human  genome  contig  intervals.  This 
procedure  was  operated  with  the  Galaxy  tool  (http:// 
main.g2.bx.psu.edu/)  (Taylor,  2007)  using  the  genome 

Non-synteny  Regions    87

data  downloaded  from  UCSC  Genome  Browser  (http:// 
genome.ucsc.edu/)  (Rhead,  2010).

Results

A  total  of  2,106  synteny  blocks  between  human  genome 
and  each  of  six  non-primate  mammalian  (mouse,  rat, 
dog,  cow,  pig,  and  opossum)  genomes  were  retrieved 
from  the  database  that  mirrored  some  relevant  tables  of 
Ensembl  database 
(Flicek, 
2010).  The  genomic  intervals  of  the  syntenic  regions 
were  uploaded  into  Galaxy  web  server  (http://main. 
g2.bx.psu.edu/)  (Taylor,  2007).  The  overlapping  intervals 
were  merged  into  117  intervals,  which  were  then 
masked  from  the  human  genome  contig  intervals  (249  in 
total) 
from  UCSC  Genome

Browser  using  Galaxy  tools.  This  procedure  resulted  in 
a  total  of  28  genomic  intervals  that  are  not  syntenic  with 
any  of  the  six  genomes  (data  not  shown).  In  collecting 
syntenic  blocks,  Ensembl  merged  genomic  alignment 
blocks  that  were  co-linear  and  less  than  200kb  apart.  If 
a  genome  assembly  gap  exists  flanking  a  syntenic 
block,  the  block  would  not  be  stitched  with  other  syn-
tenic  blocks,  we  filtered  out  the  blocks  shorter  than 
200kb  or  located  within  200kb  from  an  assembly  gap. 
We  also  excluded  non-syntenic  blocks  in  chromosome 
Y,  a 
large  portion  of  which  are  of  segmental 
duplications.  Finally  we  ended  up  with  10  such  blocks 
as  shown  in  Table  1.  One  locus  was  located  on  each 
of  chromosomes  1,  2,  9,  12,  17,  and  22,  while  two  loci 
per  each  of  chromosomes  13  and  21  were  found.  As 
shown  in  Fig.  1,  the  genomic  loci  were  found  in  five 
subtelomeric  and  five  pericentromeric  regions.  Subtelo-
meric  regions  were  known  to  be  highly  plastic  and  filled 
with  recently  shuffled  genomic  elements  (Ambrosini 
2007;  Riethman,  2005).  Pericentromeric  regions  were  al-
so  known  to  have  undergone  frequent  segmental  dupli-
cations  either  inter-chromosomal  or  intra-chromosomal 
(IHGSC  2001;  2004).  Such  genomic  rearrangement  in  re-
cent  evolutionary  history  would  have  created  human-  or 
primate-specific  genomic  regions  that  are  not  syntenic 
with  any  of  the  non-primate  mammalian  genomes.

Discussion

We  surveyed  along  human  genome  the  regions  non-syn-
tenic  with  any  of  the  known  non-primate  mammalian 
genomes.  Gaps  in  genome  sequence  assembly  may  in-
troduce  artifacts  in  identifying  such  regions.  In  order  to 
avoid  such  artifacts,  we  applied  a  strict  filtering  step 
where  putative  non-syntenic  blocks  near  gaps  were 
excluded.  The  source  data  used  in  this  analysis  were 
based  on  the  synteny  blocks  defined  by  Ensembl 
Genome  Browser  (Flicek,  2010),  which  ignored  short  in-
dels  and  tried  to  identify  a  small  number  of  large 
chunks  co-linear  between  a  pair  of  genomes.  Conse-
quently  we  ended  up  with  10  extremely  non-syntenic 
regions.  If  one  included  shorter  synteny  blocks  in  the 
calculation,  more  non-syntenic  regions  would  have  been 
identified.  With  the  current  definition  of  synteny  blocks, 
we  would  identify  only  the  most  extremely  non-syntenic 
regions.
    Interestingly  the  non-syntenic  regions  reported  here 
were  confined  to  subtelomeric  or  pericentromeric  re-
gions,  where  recent  segmental  duplications  prevailed 
(IHGSC,  2001;  2004).  Although  it  is  likely  that  invasions 
by  transposable  elements  may  also  create  species-  or 
lineage-specific  genomic  elements,  they  tend  to  be  dis-
persed  around  the  genome  and  would  not  form  a  chunk 

large  enough  to  be  identified  as  synteny  blocks.  Instead 
the  results  of  segmental  duplications  would  create  large 
chunks  that  are  non-syntenic.
