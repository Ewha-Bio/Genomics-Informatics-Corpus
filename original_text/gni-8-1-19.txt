Abstract

To  discover  genetic  markers  for  autism  spectrum  dis-
order  (ASD),  we  previously  applied  genome-wide  BAC 
array  comparative  genomic  hybridization  (array-CGH)  to 
28  autistic  patients  and  62  normal  controls  in  Korean 
population,  and  identified  that  chromosomal  losses  on 
8p23.1  and  on  17p11.2  are  significantly  associated  with 
autism.  In  this  study,  we  developed  an  8.5K  ASD-specif-
ic  BAC  array  covering  27  previously  reported  ASD-asso-
ciated  CNV  loci  including  ours  and  examined  whether 
the  associations  would  be  replicated  in  8  ASD  patient 
cell  lines  of  four  different  ethnic  groups  and  10  Korean 
normal  controls.  As  a  result,  a  CNV-loss  on  8p23.1  was 
found  to  be  significantly  more  frequent  in  patients  re-
gardless  of  ethnicity  (p＜0.0001).  This  CNV  region  con-
tains  two  coding  genes, DEFA1 and  DEFA3,  which  are 
members  of DEFENSIN  gene  family.  Two  other  CNVs  on 
17p11.2  and  Xp22.31  were  also  distributed  differently 
between  ASDs  and  controls,  but  not  significant  (p=0.069 
and  0.092,  respectively).  All  the  other  loci  did  not  show 
significant  association.  When  these  evidences  are  con-
sidered,  the  association  between  ASD  and  CNV  of 
DEFENSIN  gene  seems  worthy  of  further  exploration  to 
elucidate  the  pathogenesis  of  ASD.  Validation  studies 
with  a  larger  sample  size  will  be  required  to  verify  its  bi-
ological  implication.

Introduction

Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  neurodevelopmental 
syndrome  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  phenotypes  includ-
ing  profound  deficits  in  social  relatedness  and  commu-
nication,  repetitive  behaviors,  and  restricted  interests 
(Rutter,  2005).  There  is  accumulating  evidence  which 
suggests  substantial  genetic  contribution  to  ASD  devel-
opment  (Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley,  2001;  Veenstra- 
VanderWeele  and  Cook,  2004).  For  example,  the  con-
cordance  rate  of  autism  was  significantly  higher  in  mon-
ozygotic  twins  than  in  dizygotic  twins  (Folstein  and 
Rosen-Sheidley,  2001;  Veenstra-VanderWeele  and  Cook, 
2004).  Although  previous  studies  including  linkage  analy-
ses  have  revealed  a  number  of  potential  ASD-asso-
ciated  loci,  genetic  and  phenotypic  heterogeneity  of  the 
disease  has  made  it  difficult  to  replicate  the  results  as 
well  as  to  identify  ASD-associated  genetic  mechanisms 
(Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley,  2001;  Klauck,  2006;  Veen-
stra-VanderWeele  and  Cook,  2004).
    Recently  a  new  type  of  human  genetic  variation 
named  copy  number  variant  (CNV)  has  been  suggested 
as  one  of  the  major  sources  of  genomic  diversity  rang-
ing  from  normal  phenotypic  heterogeneity  to  disease 
susceptibility  (Freeman et al.,  2006;  Iafrate et al.,  2004; 
Sebat et al.,  2004).  Indeed,  lines  of  evidence  have  been 
reported  which  demonstrated  the  association  between 
CNV  and  ASD  (Cho  et al.,  2009;  Cook  and  Scherer, 
2008;  Glessner et al.,  2009;  Marshall et al.,  2008;  Sebat 
et al.,  2007).  In  our  previous  study,  we  identified  38 
copy  number  variable  regions  in  ASD  patients,  two  of 
which  (CNVs  on  8p23.1  and  17p11.2)  were  found  to  be 
significantly  associated  with  ASD  (Cho  et al.,  2009).
    Using  27  CNV  loci  previously  reported  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  ASD  including  ours,  we  developed  an  8.5K 
ASD-specific  BAC  array  and  screened  whether  the  as-
sociation  between  those  CNVs  would  be  replicated  in 
patient  cell  lines  of  four  different  ethnic  groups.

Methods

Study  samples

We  used  DNA  extracted  from  B-lymphocyte  cell  lines  of 
8  ASD  patients  of  four  different  ethnicities;  Caucasian, 
Chinese,  Asiatic  Indian,  and  Hispanic  (Coriell  Institute  for 
Medical  Research,  Camden,  NJ,  USA).  General  charac-
teristics  of  the  8  ASD  patients  are  shown  in  Table  1.  As 

20    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(1)  19-27,  March  2010

normal  control  subjects,  we  used  10  normal  Korean 
adults  without  any  sign  of  ASD  and  other  genetic 
disorders.  Using  the  D5500A  PUREGENE  DNA  Isolation 
kit  (QIAGEN,  Valencia,  CA,  USA),  we  extracted  genomic 
DNA  from  the  blood  of  controls  according  to  manu-
facturer’s  instructions.  DNA  quantity  and  quality  were 
checked  by  a  NanoDrop  assay  and  1%  agarose  gel 
electrophoresis.  This  study  was  performed  under  the  ap-
proval  of  the  Institutional  Review  Boards  of  The  Catholic 
University  of  Korea  (CUMC07U025).

Preparation  of  autism-specific  BAC  array  proto-
type

In  total,  846  BAC  clones  representing  the  27  candidate 
CNV  regions  were  selected  from  the  DNA  BAC  library 
(Macrogen,  Seoul,  Korea)  and  the  BAC  clone  DNA  was 
extracted  as  described  elsewhere  (Cho  et al.,  2009; 
Chung et al.,  2004).  In  brief,  each  BAC  clone  was  iso-
lated,  grown  in  500ml  of  culture  media,  pelleted,  from 
which  DNA  was  extracted  using  an  alkaline 
lysis 
method.  All  selected  clones  were  bi-directionally  se-
quenced  using  the  ABI  PRISM  3700  DNA  Analyzer 
(Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA),  and  their 
sequences  were  blasted  and  mapped  according  to  their 
linear  positions.  Extracted  BAC  DNA  was  dissolved  in 
50%  DMSO  with  a  concentration  of  400~500ng/ul  and 
spotted  in  triplicate  onto  the  glass  by  the  Genemachines 
OmniGrid  100  arrayer 
(Digilab  Genomic  Solutions, 
Holliston,  MA,  USA).  We  used  Corning  UltraGAPS  amine 
coating  slides  (Corning,  Acton,  MA,  USA)  and  Telecam 
SMP4  pins  (Arrayit  Corporation,  Sunnyvale,  CA,  USA)  for 
DNA  spotting.  We  followed  processes  for  a  general  con-
tact  type  spotter. 

Array-CGH  experiment

Array-CGH  was  performed  as  described  elsewhere  us-
ing  the  MAUI  hybridization  station  (BioMicro  Systems, 
Salt  Lake  City,  Utah,  USA)  (Joo  et al.,  2008).  In  one 

Table  1.  General  characteristics  of  8  ASD  patients

tube,  Cy3-labeled  sample  and  Cy5-labeled  reference 
DNAs  were  mixed  together  and  50μg  human  Cot  I 
DNA  (HybMasker,  ConnectaGen,  Seoul,  Korea),  20μl  of 
3  M  sodium  acetate  and  600μl  of  cold  100%  ethanol 
were  added  to  precipitate  DNA.  The  obtained  pellet  was 
re-suspended  in  40μl  of  hybridization  solution  contain-
ing  50%  formamide,  10%  dextran  sulfate,  2  SSC,  4% 
SDS  and  200  ug  of  yeast  tRNA.  Hybridization  was  per-
formed  in  slide  chambers  for  48  hr  at  37C.  After  the  hy-
bridization,  slides  were  washed  serially  at  room  temper-
ature  in  solution  1  (2X  saline-sodium  citrate  (SSC),  0.1% 
SDS)  for  10  min  (1X),  in  solution  2  (0.1X  SSC,  0.1% 
SDS)  for  10  min  (2X)  and  in  solution  3  (0.1X  SSC)  for 
1  min  (3X)  followed  by  rinsing  in  distilled  water  for  10 
sec.  Finally,  the  slides  were  spin-dried  for  2  min  at  1000 
rpm.  All  the  experiments  were  duplicated  and  dye- 
swapping  was  done  for  more  reliable  interpretation. 

Copy  number  analysis

Arrays  were  scanned  and  analyzed  using  the  GenePix 
4200A  two-color  fluorescent  scanner  (MDS  Analytical 
Technologies,  Sunnyvale,  CA,  USA)  and  the  images 
were  processed  using  the  MacViewer  1.6  imaging  soft-
ware  (Macrogen,  Seoul,  Korea).  Signal  intensity  ratios 
(test/reference)  were  measured  and  converted  to  log2 
scale.  Background  corrected  signal  intensity  ratios  were 
normalized  using  Lowess  normalization.  For  defining 
CNVs,  we  set  the  cut-off  values  of  signal  intensity  ratios 
at  above  0.25  (log2  scale)  for  copy  number  gain  and  at 

below  −0.25  for  copy  number  loss  according  to  our 

previous  study  (Cho et al.,  2009;  Jeong et al.,  2008).  We 
also  analyzed  dye-swap  experiment  results  to  get  more 
reliable  CNV  call.  If  a  CNV  call  is  true,  its  test/reference 
intensity  ratio  value  must  be  inverted  by  switching  the 
dyes.  Only  the  original  ratios  and  inverted  dye  swap  sig-
nals  were  observed,  the  according  CNV  was  called  as 
a  true  one.

Statistical  Analysis

We  used  Stata  version  10.0  (Stata  Corporation,  College 
Station,  Tx)  and  performed  the  chi-square  or  Fisher’s 
exact  test  to  compare  the  distribution  of  CNV  regions 
between  cases  and  controls.  False  discovery  rate  (FDR) 
was  used  for  multiple  comparisons  correction.  p  values 
less  than  0.05  was  considered  statistically  significant. 

Results

Design  of  ASD-specific  BAC  array

We  developed  a  ASD-specific  BAC  array  named  ‘Mac-
Array  Karyo  Autism  Prototype’  which  covers  a  total  of 
27  CNV  regions  that  have  been  reported  to  be  asso-

Fig.  1.  MacArray  Karyo  Autism  Prototype.  We  developed 
an  ASD-specific  BAC  array  named  ‘MacArray  Karyo  Autism
Prototype’  which  would  cover  a  total  of  27  CNV  regions 
that  have  been  reported  to  be  associated  with  autism  in 
previous  studies.  The  array  is  75  by  25  mm  which  contains 
846  spots  with  diameter  of  0.17  mm  and  applied  in 
triplicate.

Association  of  8p23.1  CNV  with  Autism    21

ciated  with  autism  in  previous  studies  including  ours 
(Cho  et al.,  2009;  Klauck,  2006;  Schellenberg  et al., 
2006;  Sultana et al.,  2002;  Vorstman et al.,  2006).  A  to-
tal  of  846  BAC  clones  representing  the  candidate  27 
CNV  regions  were  selected  for  designing  ASD-specific 
BAC  array  (Fig.  1).  Locus  specificities  of  selected  clones 
were  improved  by  removing  multiple  loci-binding  clones 
under  standard  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization  (FISH). 
The  information  about  those  targeted  27  genomic  re-
gions  and  846  BAC  clones  is  available  in  Supplementary 
data  1. 

CNVs  distributed  differently  between  ASDs  and 
normal  controls

Among  the  846  BAC  clones,  77  spots  (15  loci)  showed 
CNVs  in  at  least  2  study  participants.  Details  of  the 
CNV  profiles  of  the  8  ASDs  and  10  normal  controls  for 
the  77  spots  are  available  in  supplementary  data  2.  Of 
the  77  spots,  a  CNV-loss  on  8p23.1  (BAC168_A06)  was 
found  to  be  significantly  more  frequent  in  ASD  patients 
(7  out  of  8  ASD  patients  versus  none  in  controls,  p＜ 
0.0001)  (Table  2).  Two  other  CNVs  were  distributed  dif-
ferently  between  patients  and  controls,  but  not 
significant.  A  CNV-loss  on  17p11.2  (BAC130_G23)  was 
found  in  3  out  of  8  ASD  patients,  but  not  in  controls 
(p=0.069).  A  CNV-gain  on  Xp22.31  (BAC231_F19)  was 
found  in  4  out  of  10  controls,  but  not  in  ASDs  (p=0.092) 
(Table  2). 

Validation  of  CNVs  on  8p23.1  and  17p11.2  in 
ASD  patients

The  most  significant  CNV  region  (BAC168_A06,  8p23.1) 
contains  two  coding  genes,  DEFA1  and  DEFA3,  which 
are  members  of  DEFENSIN  gene  family.  Interestingly, 
the  copy  number  loss  CNV  on  8p23.1  was  identified  in 
all  four  different  ethnic  groups  and  also  consistent  in 
duplicated  experiments.  Fig.  2  shows  the  examples  of 
CNVs  on  8p23.1  and  17p11.2  in  ASD  patients,  which 
are  duplicated  and  dye  swapped  and  no  CNVs  in  nor-
mal  control  individuals.

Discussion

It  has  been  widely  accepted  that  ASD  has  a  strong  ge-
netic  background  (Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley,  2001; 
Rutter,  2005;  Veenstra-VanderWeele  and  Cook,  2004). 
Although  genomic  loci  or  genes  reported  to  be  asso-
ciated  with  ASD  were  not  easily  replicated  in  sub-
sequent  studies  for  many  reasons  such  as  disease  het-
erogeneity  per  se  and  relatively  high  noise  levels  of  ge-
nomics  technology  used,  some  of  the  ASD-associated 
CNVs  have  been  successfully  replicated.  For  example, 
CNVs  in  NRXN1,  NLGN4  and  SHANK3  genes,  which 

had  been  identified  in  target  gene  studies,  were  re-
plicated  in  genome-wide  CNV  studies  for  ASD  (Glessner 
et al.,  2009;  Marshall et al.,  2008).  Given  that  SNPs  or 
other  genetic  markers  were  not  very  consistent  in  ASD, 
this  suggests  that  structural  variation  could  be  a  more 
consistent  and  important  marker  in  ASD  and  facilitate 
the  elucidation  of  genetic  mechanisms  behind  the 
disease.
    In  our  previous  study,  we  identified  38  CNV  regions 
in  28  Korean  ASD  patients  and  two  of  them  (CNVs  on 
8p23.1  and  17p11.2)  were  significantly  associated  with 
ASD.  In  this  study,  we  designed  and  prepared  an 
ASD-specific  BAC  array  for  CNV  analysis  and  examined 

whether  the  significant  CNV  markers  would  be  re-
plicated  in  independent  ASD  patients  of  diverse  ethnic 
origins.
    The  ASD-specific  BAC  array  contains  the  two  sig-
nificant  CNV  regions  identified  in  our  previous  study  and 
also  25  putative  ASD-associated  regions  reported  by 
previous  linkage  studies  (Cho et al.,  2009;  Klauck,  2006; 
Rutter,  2005;  Schellenberg  et al.,  2006;  Sultana  et al., 
2002;  Vorstman et al.,  2006).  However,  all  25  candidate 
regions  suggested  by  linkage  analyses  were  not  re-
plicated  in  our  study  population.  This  data  seems  coher-
ent  with  previous  observations  that  positive  findings 
from  one  linkage  study  often  fail  to  replicate  in  the  other 
observation  (Glessner et al.,  2009),  but  it  could  be  due 
to  small  sample  size  of  the  study.
    In  this  study,  the  association  of  copy  number  loss 
CNV  on  8p23.1  with  ASD  was  consistently  replicated  in 
diverse  ethnic  groups.  8p23.1  locus  is  known  to  be  a 
frequent  region  of  DNA  structural  variation  in  human 
(Hollox  et al.,  2008a).  DEFENSIN  gene  family,  which  is 
a  well-known  component  of  innate  immunity,  is  clus-
tered  in  this  region  (Ganz,  1999;  Hollox  et al.,  2008a). 
CNV  of DEFENSIN  family,  especially  beta-defensin,  has 
been  reported  as  a  risk  factor  for  different  diseases 
such  as  psoriasis,  Crohn’s  disease  and  cystic  fibrosis 
(Hollox,  2008b;  Hollox  et al.,  2008c),  which  suggests 
that  CNV  of DEFENSIN  family  is  likely  to  be  associated 
with  autoimmune  diseases.  Immunological  dysfunction 
has  been  suggested  to  be  associated  with  autism 
(Folstein  and  Rosen-Sheidley,  2001;  Rutter,  2005)  and 
the  copy  number  loss  on  8p23.1  was  reported  to  be  as-
sociated  with  behavioral  problems  or  mental  slowness 
(Pettenati  et al.,  1992).  When  this  evidence  is  consid-
ered, 
the  association  between  ASD  and  CNV  of 
DEFENSIN  gene  seems  worthy  of  further  exploration  to 
elucidate  the  pathogenesis  of  ASD.  Validation  studies 
with  a  larger  sample  size  will  be  required  to  verify  its  bi-
ological  implication.
