Editor’s Introduction to This Issue

As promised in last issue’s editorial, we continue with the 
theme of epigenomics. Last issue featured Dr. Jung Kyoon 
Choi’s  review  on  the  Encyclopedia  of  DNA  Elements 
(ENCODE) project, with a special emphasis on the chro-
matin environment in regulatory elements. In this issue, Dr. 
Li Shen, Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, USA, and colleagues 
complement it by reviewing the relationship between the 
transcriptome and chromatin modifications from the per-
spective of ENCODE. We also feature a review on bacterial 
transcriptomics by Prof. Byung-Kwan Cho’s group, KAIST, 
Korea. They indicate that a large portion of a given bacterial 
genome is under transcriptional control. One of the original 
articles by Drs. Jong-Il Kim and Jeong-Sun Seo’s group, Seoul 
National  University,  Korea,  reports  heritability  indices  of 
various facial features in Korean families, discovering strong 
genetic influences on facial anthropometric traits.

As the international visibility of Genomics & Informatics has 

increased  through  its  participation  with  PubMed  Central 
(PMC) and PubMed, a broader readership naturally accom-
panies  more  critical  post-publication  reviews.  A  North 
American reader spotted an uneven writing style in one of 
the articles published in the December 2012 issue. Upon 
notification, we confirmed that its introduction section was 
indeed literally copied and pasted from earlier publications 
without quotations. We asked the corresponding authors to 
clarify this issue, and they admitted to plagiarism in their 
article. Since then, we immediately posted a retraction on 
our journal’s website. This issue, the first issue after this 
incident,  publishes  the  retraction.  Genomics  &  Informatics 
adheres to the guidelines per the Committee on Publication 
Ethics (http://publicationethics.org/). We regret this mis-
conduct.  Nevertheless,  we  appreciate  your  continued 
support.
