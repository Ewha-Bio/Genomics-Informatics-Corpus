in Tumor Sensing and Suppression

nc886 (=vtRNA2-1, pre-miR-886, or CBL3) is a newly identified non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that represses the activity of protein 
kinase R (PKR). nc886 is transcribed by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and is intriguingly the first case of a Pol III gene whose 
expression is silenced by CpG DNA hypermethylation in several types of cancer. PKR is a sensor protein that recognizes 
evading viruses and induces apoptosis to eliminate infected cells. Like viral infection, nc886 silencing activates PKR and 
induces apoptosis. Thus, the significance of the nc886:PKR pathway in cancer is to sense and eliminate pre-malignant cells, 
which is analogous to PKR’s role in cellular innate immunity. Beyond this tumor sensing role, nc886 plays a putative tumor 
suppressor  role  as  supported  by  experimental  evidence.  Collectively,  nc886  provides  a  novel  example  how  epigenetic 
silencing of a ncRNA contributes to tumorigenesis by controlling the activity of its protein ligand.

Keywords: nc886, non-coding RNA, PKR, tumor suppressor, tumor surveillance

Introduction

Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are defined as RNA trans-
cripts that are not translated into proteins. Classically, only 
a  limited  number  of  RNAs,  including  ribosomal  RNAs, 
transfer  RNAs,  small  nuclear  RNAs,  and  small  nucleolar 
RNAs,  were  perceived  as  ncRNAs.  However,  this  view 
changed completely after in-depth analysis of mammalian 
transcriptomes (reviewed in Mattick and Makunin [1]). A 
decade ago, the advent of next generation sequencing and 
high-resolution genome tiling arrays revealed that up to 70% 
of the human genome is transcribed but only about 2% is 
occupied by protein-coding regions. Moreover, some ncRNAs 
were found to play regulatory roles for gene expression, as 
compared to classical ncRNAs that play housekeeping roles. 
So, ncRNAs are much more dominant in quantity and more 
diverse in function, than they were thought before.

These regulatory ncRNAs have been a topic of intense 
study during the last decade. So far, most regulatory ncRNAs 
bind to target genes via nucleic acid interaction to serve as a 
specificity  factor  to  recruit  effector  proteins  (Fig.  1).  For 
example,  nuclear  ncRNAs  recruit  chromatin  remodeling 
factors and microRNAs (miRNAs) recruit the mRNA-slicing 

complex (reviewed in Fatica and Bozzoni [2] and Filipowicz 
et al. [3]). Our laboratory has recently discovered a ncRNA 
that functions in a completely different way and we named it 
nc886 [4, 5]. nc886’s function is to bind to a protein and 
control its activity, rather than to recognize target DNA or 
RNA. Here, a summary of its characteristics and roles in 
cancer will be reviewed.

nc886: Identity

nc886 has been given several names, including vtRNA2-1, 
CBL3, and pre-miR-886. vtRNA2-1 is currently its official 
name and stands for vault RNA 2-1 [6]. The vault RNAs 
(vtRNAs) are the RNA components in the vault complex, a 
large ribonucleoprotein particle whose precise function has 
not been elucidated yet (reviewed in Berger et al. [7]). In the 
human  genome,  there  are  three  canonical  vtRNA  genes, 
vtRNA1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. nc886 was thought to be a vtRNA 
paralog because of sequence homology and therefore was 
named  vtRNA2-1  [6].  However,  nc886  is  less  similar  in 
sequence to canonical vtRNAs than they are similar to each 
other  [5].  Furthermore,  nc886  is  neither  in  physical 
association  with  the  vault  complex  nor  necessary  for  the 
integrity of the complex [5]. nc886 is functionally distinct 
from vtRNA1-1 [4, 5, 8-10].

Another  alias  for  nc886,  CBL3,  stands  for  cord  blood 
lymphocyte (CBL)-derived ncRNA 3. This name originated 
from  the  fact  that  nc886  was  one  of  the  most  induced 
ncRNAs when CBL was infected with the Epstein-Barr virus 
(EBV) [11]. Interestingly, canonical vtRNAs were also induced 
by EBV, which also contributed to the early misconception of 
nc886 as a vtRNA [12]. 

In addition, nc886 was once classified as a miRNA pre-
cursor  and  so  was  registered  in  the  miRNA  database 
(miRBase: http://www.mirbase.org/) [13]. This was due to 
the  high  sensitivity  of  the  next-generation  sequencing 
technologies, together with the high intracellular expression 
level of nc886 but its short half-life [5]. Thus, its degradation 
products  are  continuously  produced  at  a  quantity  high 
enough to be captured by small RNA sequencing. According 
to the deepBase (http://deepbase.sysu.edu.cn/) where small 
RNA sequencing data were collected and displayed [14], the 
nc886  sequence  was  captured  at  significantly  higher  fre-
quency than most other genomic regions. In addition, 20–30 
nucleotides  at  the  5'-  and  3'-end  of  nc886  were  captured 
more prominently than its middle portion. This sequencing 
pattern misinterpreted as each end corresponding to mature 
miR-886-5p  and  -3p  respectively.  However,  our  extensive 
analysis proved that it is not a miRNA precursor. First and 
foremost, nc886 appears as a single band at 101 nucleotides 
(nts)  in  Northern  hybridization  [4,  5,  8-10].  Second,  the 
biogenesis of nc886 is dissimilar to that of miRNAs; nc886 is 
neither  processed  from  Drosha  cleavage  nor  diced  into 
mature  miRNAs  by  Dicer  [5].  Third,  there  is  no  inverse 
correlation in expression between nc886 and the predicted 
target  genes  of  miR-886-5p  or  -3p,  which  is  against  our 
expectation if nc886 would to produce functional mature 
miRNAs [5].

Since nc886 does not produce a miRNA precursor nor is in 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  2,  2015

the vault complex, its aliases pre-miR-886 and vtRNA2-1 are 
misleading.  Therefore,  our  research  group  renamed  it 
non-coding  886  (nc886)  [4]  and  this  name  will  be  used 
throughout the review. 

nc886:  Transcription,  Expression,  and  Ge-
nomic Locus

Whereas many other regulatory ncRNAs are transcribed 
by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (Fig. 1), nc886 is transcribed 
by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) as evidenced by its sequence 
and experimental data. nc886 contains the well-conserved 
Pol  III  promoter  elements  Box  A  and  B  followed  by  an 
oligo-dT sequence, which is a Pol III termination signal (red 
colors in Fig. 2). The actual occupation of Pol III on the nc886 
genomic  region  was  consistently  shown  by  chromatin 
immunoprecipitation  followed  by  ultra-high-throughput 
sequencing  (ChIP-seq  data)  from  several  research  groups 
[15-17]. It is generally thought that Pol III activity is elevated 
in  cancer  [18].  In  agreement  with  this  idea,  the  nc886 
expression  level  is  high  in  many  cancer  cells  relative  to 
normal tissues (YSL, unpublished data) [5].

On  the  contrary,  nc886  expression  is  silenced  by  CpG 
DNA hypermethylation in many malignancies [8, 9, 19, 20]. 
Methylation at CpG dinucleotides is the most common type 
of epigenetic modification of the mammalian genomic DNA 
(reviewed in Klose and Bird [21]). Some genes have CpG 
islands,  which  are  blocks  of  sequence  where  CpG  dinu-
cleotides are enriched and located mostly in the promoter 
region.  Hypermethylation  in  CpG  islands  represses  gene 
transcription and this is one of the most frequent ways that 
tumor suppressor genes are silenced in cancer. Noticeably, 
the genomic region of nc886 has a CpG island (blue bar in 
Fig. 2). Many studies, done mostly on protein-coding genes 
transcribed by Pol II, indicate that chromatin remodeling is 
the  prevalent  mechanism  by  which  CpG  methylation 
silences  gene  expression.  However,  CpG  methylation  has 
barely been examined in ncRNA genes transcribed by Pol III. 
To the best of our knowledge, nc886 is the first and so far 
only  case  of  a  Pol  III  transcript  that  is  silenced  by  CpG 
hypermethylation in cancer. So, nc886 should serve as an 
ideal model gene for studying a mechanism for epigenetic 
regulation of Pol III transcription.

nc886 is encoded on human chromosome 5q31 and its 
locus is flanked by transforming growth factor β-induced 
(TGFBI) and SMAD5, both of which are implicated in the 
transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway 
(Fig. 2). Although this suggests a possible co-regulation of 
nc886 with these two genes, it is interesting to consider the 
CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a barrier protein blocking 
the spread of heterochromatin (reviewed in Ong and Corces

sites.  The  diagram  is  not  drawn  to  actual  scale.  The  nc886  region  containing  a  CpG  island  is  magnified  in  the  middle  diagram,  and

signatures  are  in  red.  This  cartoon  has  been  modified  from  [8,  9].  TGFBI,  transforming  growth  factor  β-induced;  CTCF,  CCCTC-binding

[22]). ChIP-seq data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements 
(ENCODE) indicate that there are two CTCF binding sites at 
each side of the nc886 region (brown bars in Fig. 2), suggesting 
that  the  chromatin  status  of  nc886  is  being  insulated  by 
CTCF. According to our unpublished data, nc886 seemed to 
be co-regulated with its flanking genes in some cancer cells 
but not in others. Given the established role of the TGF-β 
signaling in cancer, it will be interesting to investigate the 
involvement of TGF-β in the regulation of nc886/TGFBI/ 
SMAD5 expression.

nc886: A Protein Kinase R Inhibitor ncRNA

As  aforementioned,  nc886  is  a  molecular  switch  for  a 
protein to modulate its activity. That protein is protein kinase 
R  (PKR).  PKR  is  an  interferon-inducible,  double-stranded 
RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase that senses viral 
infection in the cellular cytoplasm (reviewed in Garcia et al. 
[23]). The PKR signaling pathway is very complicated: it is 
activated by several other stresses besides viral infection and 
its  activation  affects  many  downstream  pathways.  Ela-
boration on the whole PKR pathway is beyond the scope of 
this review, but here a very brief introduction only about 
relevant parts will be provided.

Upon viral infection, the classical PKR pathway begins 
with its binding to virus-derived dsRNA that activates PKR 
and  subsequently  its  downstream  events,  including  (1) 
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α subunit 
(eIF2α) to block global protein synthesis and (2) activation 
of nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells 

(nuclear factor κB [NF-κB]). The PKR:eIF2α  branch leads 
to apoptosis and this explains how mammalian organisms 
eliminate virally-infected cells. In contrast, the PKR:NF-κB 
branch is usually considered to be pro-survival. Besides the 
innate  immune  response,  numerous  papers  have  also 
documented  PKR’s  role  in  cancer  in  the  absence  of  viral 
infection.  Along  with  its  two  opposite  functions  through 
eIF2α and NF-κB, both tumor suppressive and oncogenic 
roles  for  PKR  have  been  reported  in  cancer  (reviewed  in 
Marchal et al. [24]).

nc886 binds to PKR with an affinity comparable to dsRNA 
and prevents PKR from being activated, in contrast to the 
PKR-activating ligand dsRNA [4, 5, 8-10]. One reason for 
these contradictory outcomes between nc886 and dsRNA is 
their difference in length. dsRNA is long enough to acco-
mmodate PKR dimerization which is a necessary step for its 
autophosphorylation  and  subsequent  activation  (Fig.  3). 
nc886 at 101 nts long is probably too short for two PKR 
molecules to bind. When nc886 is ectopically expressed, it 
attenuates dsRNA-mediated PKR activation [10]. Notably, 
knockdown of nc886 is sufficient for PKR activation in the 
absence of dsRNA [4, 5, 8, 9], indicating that human PKR 
has  an  intrinsic  tendency  to  self-activate  and  so  needs  a 
repressor to avoid its aberrant activation. In summary, nc886 
is a PKR inhibitor.

nc886: Its Tumor Sensing Role

Both  knockdown  of  nc886  and  introduction  of  dsRNA 
activate  PKR  (Fig.  3).  nc886  silencing  does  occur  during

several other research groups have reported that the sup-
pressed expression of nc886 in many different cancer types 
including lung cancer [19, 26, 27], thyroid cancer [28], and 
breast cancer [29]. Although these papers claimed that they 
detected  mature  miRNAs,  miR-886-5p  and  -3p,  nc886  is 
most probably what they detected, because their detection 
methods  could  not  efficiently  distinguish  the  mature 
miRNAs from nc886.

Second, the silencing of nc886 RNA expression is caused 
by CpG hypermethylation, which is one of the most common 
mechanisms to inactivate tumor suppressor genes in cancer. 
The significance of nc886 CpG methylation in the prognosis 
of cancer patients has been proven by our ESCC and GC data 
[8, 9] as well as other groups’ data in lung cancer [19] and 
acute myeloid leukemia [20].

Third,  acute  depletion  of  nc886  activates  oncogenes. 
These  oncogenes  include  renowned  ones,  such  as  FOS, 
MYC, MAFB, and ID2, all of which are known to drive cells 
to malignancy when aberrantly overexpressed [30-33]. Also, 
nc886 depletion activates oncogenic NF-κB in a PKR-de-
pendent manner [4, 8, 9] and in this case PKR acts as an 
oncogene  in  the  few  cells  that  have  survived  the  nc886: 
PKR:eIF2α-mediated  apoptotic  branch.  In  this  context, 
nc886 is an inhibitor of the PKR oncogene and therefore is a 
tumor suppressor. 

Fourth, nc886 is antiproliferative. Ectopic expression of 
nc886 inhibits growth of several cancer cells [8, 9]. This 
effect is specific, because such toxic effects are seen only in 
cancer cells that do not express endogenous nc886 but not in 
non-malignant cells that express endogenous nc886. nc886’s 
antiproliferative  role  is  thought  to  be,  at  least  partially, 
through  suppressing  NF-κB,  as  supported  by  our  expe-
rimental data from cholangiocarcinoma [4].

(nc886) silencing. PKR, protein kinase R; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation
factor  2α  subunit.

tumorigenesis  and  dsRNA  is  generated  during  viral  in-
fection. The significance of PKR in viral infection is to sense 
viruses  and  remove  them  by  inducing  apoptosis  through 
eIF2α phosphorylation. We implanted this scenario in cancer 
and proposed a tumor surveillance model. In this model, 
nc886  silencing  in  pre-malignant  cells  is  sensed  by  PKR, 
which  eliminates  them  through  eIF2α  phosphorylation. 
Another  important  point  in  this  model  is  the  escape  of 
viruses  or  cancer  cells  from  the  PKR:eIF2α  cell  death 
pathway. Viruses have various strategies to bypass or disarm 
PKR. Likewise, some potential cancer cells can survive the 
PKR surveillance through genetic or epigenetic alterations. 
For  an  elaborate  description  on  the  tumor  surveillance 
model, please read this review [25].

nc886: Its Tumor Suppressor Role

Conclusion and Future Direction

In  addition  to  the  nc886:PKR  pathway  in  the  tumor 
surveillance,  does  nc886  silencing  play  an  active  role  in 
tumor  etiology  or  progression?  Two  recent  papers  have 
provided  several  pieces  of  evidence  for  nc886  being  a 
putative tumor suppressor [8, 9]. 

First, nc886 expression is suppressed in clinical tumor 
samples compared to normal tissues, and more importantly, 
the low expression of nc886 correlates with poor survival of 
patients. This was seen in paired normal/tumor specimens 
from 88 gastric cancer (GC) and 84 esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients [8, 9]. nc886 expression is 
also silenced in a number of cancer cell lines of diverse tissue 
origins, such as esophagus [8], stomach [9], breast (YSL, 
unpublished data), ovary (YSL, unpublished data), bile duct 
[4], head and neck, lung, cervix [5], etc. Besides our data, 

nc886 is a newly discovered ncRNA that controls PKR 
activity  and  plays  tumor  sensing  and  suppressing  roles. 
nc886’s expression pattern and function in tumors opens a 
possibility  that  its  measurement  can  be  a  diagnostic  or 
prognostic marker and its administration into cancer cells 
can be a therapeutic strategy. Nonetheless, we expect that 
nc886’s  role  is  multifaceted  in  cancer  and  may  even  be 
oncogenic in certain contexts, because nc886 expression as 
well as PKR’s role can be in two opposite directions in cancer. 
Also, nc886 is a unique case of a Pol III gene that is epi-
genetically silenced in cancer and so provides an intriguing 
model for studying epigenetic regulation of Pol III.
