Since the advent of whole-genome sequencing, transposable elements (TEs), just thought to be ‘junk’ DNA, have been 
noticed because of their numerous copies in various eukaryotic genomes. Many studies about TEs have been conducted to 
discover their functions in their host genomes. Based on the results of those studies, it has been generally accepted that they 
have a function to cause genomic and genetic variations. However, their infinite functions are not fully elucidated. Through 
various  mechanisms,  including  de  novo  TE  insertions,  TE  insertion-mediated  deletions,  and  recombination  events,  they 
manipulate their host genomes. In this review, we focus on Alu, L1, human endogenous retrovirus, and short interspersed 
element/variable number of  tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) elements  and discuss how they have affected primate genomes, 
especially the human and chimpanzee genomes, since their divergence.

Keywords: Alu elements, DNA transposable elements, endogenous retroviruses, long interspersed nucleotide elements, SVA

Introduction

Transposable elements (TEs), mobile segments of genetic 
material,  were  first  discovered  by  McClintock  [1].  Since 
then, they have been identified in a variety of eukaryotes [2]. 
Recent genome sequencing projects have consistently shown 
that TEs make up ∼50% of primate genomes, while coding 
DNA  occupies  only  ∼2%  of  the  genomes  [3-5].  TEs  are 
generally divided into two categories, DNA transposons and 
retrotransposons (Fig. 1), based on their manner of mobili-
zation. DNA transposons move using a cut-and-paste me-
chanism [6]. In contrast, retrotransposons move in a copy- 
and-paste  fashion  by  duplicating  the  element  into  a  new 
genomic location via an RNA intermediate [7]. Thus, retro-
transposons increase their copy number more rapidly than 
DNA transposons.

Retrotranspons include short interspersed element (SINE), 
long interspersed element (LINE), and human endogenous 
retrovirus  (HERV).  Alu  and  short  interspersed  element/ 
variable number of tandem repeats/Alu (SVA) elements are 
primate-specific  retrotransposons,  and  their  full-length  is 
300 bp and 2 kb, respectively. The Alu element is the most 
successful SINE in terms of its copy number; ∼1.2 million 
Alu copies exist in the human genome. LINE is ∼6 kb in 
length, and thus, it is much longer than the SINEs. This 

element has two open reading frames encoding enzymatic 
machineries  essential  for  the  propagation  of  the  three 
elements; the Alu element depends on reverse transcriptase 
of  LINE  for  making  their  dispersed  copies  in  the  host 
genome [8]. In contrast to SINE and LINE, which do not 
have long terminal repeats (LTRs), the full-length HERV (∼
10 kb) has two LTRs, and three genes-gag, pol, and env-are 
located between them [8, 9].

Studies on active TEs have suggested that the elements 
could  alter  gene  expression  by  providing  cis-regulatory 
elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and transcription 
factor binding sites [10]. Through these mechanisms, altered 
transcriptional  activity  could  lead  to  dysfunctional  and 
abnormal proteins. Through de novo TE insertion within a 
gene, TEs could alter a gene product, which could be either 
harmful or beneficial to its host genome [11, 12]. In cases 
where an inserted TE causes a harmful effect on its host 
genome, the TE is likely to go to inactivation and fossiliza-
tion by evolutionary accumulation of mutations and silen-
cing effects [13]. 

Since the divergence of the human and chimpanzee, ∼6 
million  years  ago,  many  TEs  have  propagated  in  each 
genome. Among them are the Alu, L1, SVA, and HERV-K 
(HML-2) elements. During the past 6 million years, 5,530 
Alu, 1,835 L1, 864 SVA, and 113 HERV-K (HML-2) elements

Fig.  1.  Structures  of  transposable  elements.  These  elements  could  be  categorized  into  retrotransposons  (Alu,  long  interspersed  element
[LINE], and human endogenous retrovirus [HERV]) (A) and DNA transposons (e.g., MARINER) (B) based on their manner of mobilization.
In  addition,  autonomous  elements  (e.g.,  HERV  and  LINE)  have  coding  genes  responsible  for  their  own  mobilization  but  also  other 
nonautonomous  elements  (e.g.,  Alu  and  short  interspersed  element/variable  number  of  tandem  repeats/Alu  [SVA]).  Alu  consists  of  two 
monomers  separated  by  an  A-rich  connector,  one  of  which,  the  left  monomer,  includes  internal  RNA  polymerase  III  promoter  (A  and
B  boxes).  Full-length  of  LINE  is  ∼6  kb  and  has  open  reading  frames  (ORFs)  encoding  RNA-binding  protein,  endonuclease,  and 
reverse-transcriptase, which are flanked by untraslated regions (UTRs). ORF1 and ORF2 are separated by an  ∼60-bp-long intergenic spacer
(IS). SVA contains a (CCCTCT)n hexamer, Alu-like sequences, variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR), and short interspersed element-R
(SINE-R). An arrow on Alu-like sequences indicates the direction of Alu. HERV has gag, prt, pol, and env genes flanked by a long terminal
repeat (LTR), which encodes capsid protein, protease, polymerase, and envelop protein, respectively, used in viral infection. As an example
of  DNA  transposon, mariner has  a gene encoding  transposase with a  DNA-binding  domain  and  catalytic domain  flanked  by an inverted
repeat (IR). All elements are flanked by target site duplication (TSD) through integration. DDE, the conserved DDE sequence of  the mariner
transposase;  NLS,  nuclear  localization  signal.

are  estimated to  have  been  newly inserted in the  human 
genome (Table 1) [8, 14, 15]. These elements could act as an 
agent causing human-specific genomic rearrangements via 
de novo TE insertions, TE insertion-mediated deletions, and 
homologous recombination events [12, 16-19]. Furthermore, 
some of the recent integrated TEs are capable of producing 
new copies in the human genome. These de novo TE inser-
tions have the potential to cause a genomic difference among 
human  populations  and  even  human  individuals,  which 
could be related to human phenotypes and diseases [20]. 

In this review, we describe species-specific TEs and discuss 

how they affect their host genomes, focusing on illustrating 
the  mechanisms  that  they  utilize  with  examples.  Taken 
together, we suggest that TEs, often called ‘junk’ DNA, in 
fact have many functions and play a significant and dynamic 
role in primate genomic evolution.

specific  TEs  have  been  well  studied  in  various  primate 
genomes, including human, chimpanzee, and rhesus maca-
que.  During  the  past  6  million  years,  more  than  10,000 
human-specific TEs were newly inserted in the human [21]. 
The majority of the identified elements belong to Alu, L1, 
and SVA retrotransposons. These elements have contributed 
to the genomic difference between human and non-human 
primates through insertion and post-insertion recombina-
tion between the elements [8, 22].

Alu elements are most ubiquitous in the human genome. 
A master gene model has been generally accepted to explain 
the amplification of Alu elements. In the model, only limited 
numbers of hyperactive “source” or “master” genes are able 
to produce a high number of Alu copies over evolutionary 
time. One of the previous studies about the AluYb subfamily, 
one of the most active Alu subfamilies in the human genome, 
found  that  the  copy  number  of  AluYb  elements  is  very 
different between human and non-human primates; a high 
copy number of AluYb elements exists in the human, but a 
very  small  number  of  the  elements  exists  in  non-human 
primates [23]. The oldest AluYb element resides at its ortho-
logous position in all hominid primate genomes, demonstra-
ting that the AluYb subfamily emerged 18 to 25 million years 
ago. Then, after approximately 20 million years of retrotrans-
positional quiescence, a major expansion of the subfamily 
occurred only in the human genome within the past several 
million years. To explain their successful proliferation in the 
human genome, a new model, “stealth driver,” was intro-
duced. In this model, a high copy of the Alu elements could 
be driven at least in part by “stealth driver” elements, which 
maintain low retrotransposition activity over extended peri-
ods of time. Although this element has low retrotranspo-
sition activity, they have the potential to produce short-lived 
hyperactive copies responsible for the remarkable expansion 
of AluYb elements within the human genome [24].

L1 is another successful element, occupying ∼17% of the 

human genome. The copy number of Alu elements is much 
higher than that of L1 (Alu, ∼1.2 million copies; L1, ∼520,000 
copies). Nonetheless, Alu elements are responsible for ∼ 11% 
of  the  human genome, because  the  Alu  element is much 
shorter than L1 (Alu average length, 300 bp; full-length of 
LINE,  6  kb)  [25].  Through  characterization  of  sequence 
diversity of chimpanzee-specific L1 subfamilies as compared 
to their human-specific counterparts, it was concluded that 
L1s  experienced  different  evolutionary  fates  between 
humans and chimpanzees within the past ∼6 million years. 
Although the species-specific L1 copy numbers were on the 
same order in the two species (1,800 human-specific L1s vs. 
1,200 
the  number  of 
retrotransposition- competent elements was much higher in 
the human genome than in the chimpanzee genome. The 
species-specific  L1s  were  grouped 
into  several  L1 
subfamilies. All human L1 subfamilies belonged to a single 
lineage, but two distinct L1 lineages were identified in the 
chimpanzee genome [15].

chimpanzee-specific  L1s), 

SVA is shared only in human and apes. Fewer than 1,000 
copy  numbers  were  detected  in  orangutan  (∼15  million 
years  ago),  and  no  SVA  detected  in  Old  World  monkeys 
indicating SVA is a hominid-specific element. Like Alu ele-
ments, SVA elements retrotranspose to another locus in trans 
by using reverse-transcriptase encoded by L1s [8]. Due to 
the limited mobilization and short evolutionary time, the 
copy number of SVA is very small compared to Alu and L1 
elements [15, 26, 27]. There are six SVA subfamilies (SVA_A 
to SVA_F) in the human genome. The older, SVA_A to SVA_ 
D,  evolved  in  a  single  lineage,  whereas  human-specific 
SVA_E and SVA_F were derived independently from their 
ancestral sequences. The copy number of SVA was estimated 
throughout  the primate  genomes of human,  chimpanzee, 
and gorilla, and there was no significant difference among 
them.  The  two  elements,  Alu  and  L1,  showed  a  huge 
expansion at a specific evolutionary time along the primate 
lineage, but SVA still did not show any burst in its copy 
number [26, 27].

Genomic Rearrangements by TEs

The  comparison  of  human  and  chimpanzee  genomic 
sequences showed that the two genomes have a much higher 
sequence identity than we expected [3, 4]. In spite of the 
sequence similarity, TEs have remarkably generated geno-
mic differences between the two species since their diver-
gence [22]. Many studies have suggested that a number of 
TEs are still active to retrotranspose and have the potential 
to cause genomic variations as a major driver [12, 16-19, 28]. 
In  reality,  TEs  have  rearranged  human  and  non-human 
primate genomes through various mechanisms, such as de

These genomic changes caused by TEs have increased the 
genomic  difference  between  human  and  non-human  pri-
mates, and some of the human-specific genomic rearrange-
ments caused human diseases [28, 34]. 

Advanced sequencing technology, including next-genera-
tion sequencing, and combined computational analyses have 

accelerated the studies on the dynamics of TE mobilization 
[35]. In reality, human-specific TEs have been continuously 
investigated, and the majority of them are Alu, L1, and SVA 
elements  [8,  14].  The  relationship  between  human  brain 
evolution and Alu elements was studied. Since the diver-
gence of the human and chimpanzee lineages, the human 
brain has rapidly changed in terms of mass [36]. It is not an 
exaggeration to say that Alu elements are in part responsible

for the human brain mass. Interestingly, de novo Alu inser-
tions have been identified in many human brain genes that 
are related to neuronal functions and neurological disorders 
[37]. The inserted Alu elements belong to AluYa5, AluYb8, 
and AluYc1, which are human-specific Alu subfamilies [37]. 
Approximately 1,800 human-specific L1s were identified 
in the human genome [15]. They belonged to two different 
subfamilies, pre-Ta and Ta; Ta is subdivided into Ta-0 and 
Ta-1 by diagnostic nucleotides [38]. Among hominid-specific 
SVA subfamilies, SVA_E and SVA_F are only detected in the 
human  genome,  but  the  other  four  subfamilies,  SVA_A, 
SVA_B, SVA_C, and SVA_D, are shared in human and other 
apes, including chimpanzee and gorilla [26]. HERV appeared 
in  the  primate  genome  through  germ-line  infection  [30]. 
There  are  approximately  98,000  HERVs  in  the  human 
genome. Full-length HERVs are ∼10 kb in length, but most 
of the HERVS existing in the human are defective due to 
truncation and accumulation of mutations during primate 
evolution [39]. Among various HERV subfamilies, HERV-K 
(HML2) is the youngest element in the human genome [8, 
40];  113  human-specific  HERV-Ks  were  identified  in  the 
human  genome,  and  among  them, there  were  15  and  98 
full-length HERV-Ks and solitary LTRs, respectively [39]. 
These de novo TE insertions showed polymorphisms among 
human populations and even human individuals [31, 39, 41, 
42]. Therefore, they have the potential to be used as a genetic 
marker for racial identification [31, 41, 42].

De novo TE insertions contribute to the genome expan-
sion. Actually, some of them somewhat decreased their host 
genomes involving the insertion-mediated deletion of host 
genome sequences [32, 33]. Through comparative genomic 
analyses,  50  L1  insertion-mediated  deletion  events  were 
found in the human and chimpanzee genomes [18]. The sizes 
of the deleted sequences were variable, and in sum, ∼18 kb 
and ∼15 kb of sequences were removed from the human and 
chimpanzee genomes, respectively. Based on the result, it 
was estimated that L1 insertions may have deleted up to 7.5 
Mb of target genomic sequences during the primate radia-
tion. Alu insertions were also involved in the genomic dele-
tions at its insertion target regions through Alu retrotrans-
position-mediated  deletion.  A  total  of  33  deletion  events 
responsible for a ∼9,000-bp deletion in human and chim-
panzee genomes were identified. It was suggested that Alu 
retrotransposition may have contributed to over 3,000 dele-
tion events, leading to a ∼900-kb deletion during primate 
evolution  [17].  Additionally,  13  SVA  insertion-mediated 
deletions  (SIMDs)  were  also  identified  in  the  human 
genome, and they deleted 30,785 bp of the human genome 
compared with the chimpanzee genome (Table 1). Among 
the 13 SIMDs, 9 were associated with the SVA_D subfamily, 
occupying the largest portion of SVAs, which suggests that 

SIMD frequency is directly correlated to the copy number of 
SVA  elements.  Furthermore,  one  of  the  deletion  events 
occurred  in  the  tMDC  II  gene  associated  with  sperm-egg 
binding prior to fertilization [43, 44].

After  TE  insertions  into  the  host  genome,  they  could 
generate genomic variations through unequal homologous 
recombination events between them [17, 19, 43]. The copy 
number  of  TEs  is  closely  related  to  the  frequency  of  the 
recombination between them. Thus, compared to other TEs, 
Alu and L1 elements have a high probability of generating 
genomic structural variations due to their ubiquity. In reality, 
492 Alu recombination-mediated deletions (ARMDs) were 
identified in the human genome, and they deleted ∼400 kb 
of human genomic sequences (Table 1). About 60% of the 
deletion events were related to known or predicted genes, 
including  three  that  deleted  functional  exons.  Thus,  the 
ARMD process has produced a considerable portion of the 
genomic  and  phenotypic  variations  between  humans  and 
chimpanzees since the divergence of the two species [16]. 
The recombination between L1 elements has also deleted 
human genome sequences. Seventy-three L1 recombination- 
associated deletions (L1RADs) were identified in the human 
genome [45]. The sizes of the deletion events range from 56 
to 64,113 bp, and ∼450 kb of human genomic sequence was 
deleted through this L1RAD process (Table 1). Thus, the 
L1RAD event has deleted 25 times as much human genomic 
sequence as the L1 insertion-mediated deletion event [18, 
45].

Genomic Instability Generated by TEs

The TEs inserted in intra- and inter-genic regions could 
alter cellular gene expression, increasing genomic instability 
[9]. About a decade ago, gene regulation by TEs was studied 
only in specific genes through experimental validation. How-
ever, genome-wide analyses of gene regulation by TEs were 
recently conducted due to the developed high-throughput 
technologies.  The  findings  showed  that  TEs  have  many 
regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, poly-
adenylation  signals,  and  cryptic  splicing  donor  (5')  and 
acceptor (3') sites, by which the transcript architecture of 
nearby genes can be altered [10, 46, 47].

When TEs insert into the intronic region of genes, they 
could create a new exon by offering splicing sites, and this 
process  is  called  “exonization”  [48].  This  mechanism  is 
related to exon variations, such as cassette exons and intron 
retention in exons, increasing mRNA instability [49]. The 
TEs residing upstream of any gene could act as an alternative 
promoter, leading to new alternative transcripts with a new 
transcriptional start site [10]. Some TEs carry bidirectional 
promoters  with  transcription  factor  binding  sites.  For 

230

example, LTR and L1 have sense promoters initiating their 
transcription and antisense promoters having the potential 
to initiate the transcription of other genes in the opposite 
direction  [50,  51].  There  is  a  microRNA  gene  cluster  in 
human chromosome 19 (C19MC), over 100 kb in length. 
This cluster consists of the duplication of a core cassette, 
including  a  minus-strand  Alu  element.  The  cluster  grew 
successfully during primate evolution, and the Alu element 
promotes  microRNA  expression  by  RNA  polymerase  III 
[52]. TEs not only initiate transcription but also terminate it 
by offering a polyadenylation signal. A full-length L1 con-
tains 19 polyadenylation signals that could cause premature 
mRNA truncation [53]. The genes that contain TEs in their 
genic region have a tendency to produce various transcript 
forms, causing transcriptome diversity [10]. 

The orientation of TEs could be a factor affecting gene 
expression, which is well described by a “head-on collision” 
hypothesis. During DNA replication, DNA polymerase colli-
des with RNA polymerase transcription complexes moving 
in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  movement  of  the  DNA 
polymerase. It was observed that the collision slows down 
the DNA replication [54]. In cases where active TE exists in 
the opposite direction to its nearby genes, an RNA poly-
merase  transcription  complex  transcribing  the  TE  could 
encounter any of the RNA polymerase transcription com-
plexes transcribing nearby genes, which could reduce the 
expression of the gene [54, 55]. In reality, transcription of 
the E-globin gene is repressed by an Alu element that has 
been inserted in the opposite direction to the gene [56]. On 
the other hand, TEs inserting in the same direction to its 
nearby genes show no effect on the expression of the genes 
[55]. 

Histone  modification  plays  an  important  role  in  gene 
transcriptional  regulation,  and  through  this  process,  the 
host genome could regulate the activation of TEs [57, 58]. In 
reality,  most  TEs  are  accompanied  by  repressive  histone 
modifications (e.g., H3K9me2 and H3K27me3), which cause 
the  formation  of  heterochromatin.  Conversely,  TEs  could 
affect the expression of host genes through histone modifi-
cations  [59,  60].  The  level  of  histone  modifications  was 
calculated in all families of human TEs, and older TE families 
carried more histone modifications than younger families. 
Interestingly,  TEs  proximal  to  genes  carry  more  histone 
modifications than the ones that are distal to genes, which 
suggests  that  some  epigenetic  modifications  of  TEs  may 
serve to regulate the expression of host genes [61]. 

DNA methylation is a strict silencing mechanism, and the 
host genome could use this process to repress the activation 
of TEs [61]. In general, DNA methylation occurs in a CpG 
dinucleotide.  Because  Alu  and  SVA  elements have  a  high 
degree of CpG dinucleotides, they are vulnerable to methy-

lation [26, 62]. It was observed that TEs regain their activity 
to mobilize and regulate the expression of host genes when 
the  silencing  effect  becomes  slackened  with  increasing 
genomic instability. In addition, the demethylation of TEs is 
associated  with  human  diseases,  commonly  in  cancer 
[63-65].

miRNAs, one of the most active factors regulating gene 
expression,  could  be  derived  from  TEs.  Fifty-five  genes 
derived from TEs were identified in the human genome, and 
their  characterization  showed  that  TE-derived  miRNAs 
could  potentially  regulate  the  complex  and  dynamics  of 
human genes [66].

Conclusions

TEs  have  shown  a  variety  of  impacts  on  their  host 
genomes. In this review, we describe HERV, Alu, L1, and SVA 
elements, which are thought to still be active in the human 
genome. A number of research studies related to TEs have 
shed new light on their amplification mechanisms and their 
function in primate genomes. Furthermore, recent research 
of TEs in the rhesus macaque genome provides a glimpse 
into  their  diversity  and  strong  influence  on  the  overall 
differences in genomic architecture between the Old World 
monkey (e.g., rhesus macaque) and hominid (e.g., human 
and ape) lineages [67]. The occurrence of de novo TE inser-
tions, TE insertion-mediated deletions, and post-insertion 
recombination between TEs within the human and chim-
panzee lineages has caused genetic alteration, lineage-specific 
genomic rearrangements, and phenotypic variations, further 
contributing to the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. 
As  a  whole,  this  review  calls  into  question  whether  TEs 
should be considered “junk” DNA at all. Rather, TEs repre-
sent a potent evolutionary force associated with genomic 
fluidity in their host genomes.
