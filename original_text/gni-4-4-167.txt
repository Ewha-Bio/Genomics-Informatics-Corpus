Abstract 
PABAP (Palindrome Analysis by BLAST Program) is an 
analysis  system  that  identifies  palindromic  sequences 
from a large genome sequence up to several megabases 
long. It uses NCBI BLAST as a searching engine, and data 
processing such as alignment filtration and detection of 
inverted repeats which satisfy user- defined parameters 
is performed by manipulating data after populating into a 
MySQL database. PABAP outperforms publicly available 
palindrome  search  program  in  that  it  can  detect  large 
palindrome with  internal  spacer at a faster speed from 
bacterial  genomes.  It  is a  standalone application and  is 
freely available for noncommercial users. 
Availability:  This application was implemented with free 
software (Peri, Apache, MySQL, and NCBI BLAST) and is 
freely  available  to  noncommercial  users  upon  request. 
Analysis  of  user  data  can  be  carried  out  directly  at 
http://chimp.kribb.re.kr/-javamint/palindrome. 

Keywords:  palindrome, inverted repeat,  BLAST 

Palimdromic sequence is a region in DNA containing a pair 
of inverted repeats, i.e.,  a region whose 5' -to-3' sequence 
is identical on each DNA strand. Palindromic sequences 
include inverted repeats having central gap (spacer) and 
quasi palindromes with nonidentical pair of repeats. These 
structures are widespreadin the natural plasmids, viral and 
bacterial  genomes,  eukaryotic  chromosomes  and  cell 
organelles.  In  case  of prokaryotes,  they may serve as 
binding sites for regulatory proteins,  while short perfect 
palindromes  are  known  as  recognition  sites for type  II 
restriction-modification systems (Gelfand and Koonin, 1997; 
Rocha eta/., 2001 ). Apparently, they often serve as site

for protein-DNA interaction and mediate important cellular 
functions. Another important property of such motifs is their 
potential to form intra-strand hydrogen bonds within DNA 
molecules or in corresponding RNA transcripts. Therefore, 
they  are  contained  in  genes  encoding  functional  RNA 
molecules,  the  structure  of  which  depends  on  the 
formation of proper intra-strand bonding, and in different 
cis-acting genetic elements, like terminators, attenuators, 
plasmid and viral origins of replication. Protein binding and 
secondary structure formation are also modes of action for 
inverted repeats and related motifs in eukaryotic cells. For 
example,  palindromes with  a  spacer of one nucleotide 
were  identified  in  yeast  sequences  regulating  cellular 
response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the 
endoplasmic  reticulum  (Mori  et  a/.,  1998)  and  a 
heterodimeric  complex  was  isolated  that  binds  two 
palindromic  sequences  in  the  promoter  region  of the 
human erbB-2 gene (Chen and Gill,  1996). In  mouse B 
lymphoma  cells,  palindromic  and  potential  stem-loop 
motifs were identified as break-points during class switch 
recombination (Tashiro eta/., 2001 ); and the formation of 
intra-strand  secondary  structures  is  essential  in  the

process of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement known as 
V(D)J joining (Cuomo eta/.,  1996). 

We  developed  a  web  application  PABAP  that  can 
identify  palindrome  sequence  using  genome-scale 
sequence as an input. In this application, self-against-self 
BLASTN (Altschul eta/., 1990)search is employed to find 
out symmetric hits that can  be used for identifying true 
palindromic sequences or inverted repeats after filtering 
process with customizable parameters. Fig. 1 shows the 
processing flow for this application. First, users provide a 
FAST A-formatted sequence as an input. Threshold values 
that are used for running  BLAST and filtering  hits after 
homology search  are given simultaneously at the data 
input page. P.fter formatting input sequence to generate 
BLAST -compatible database, BLASTN search is executed 
using  the  input  sequence  also  as  a  query without  low 
complexity filter. Output is set to tabular format to facilitate 
loading results directly into a MySQL database. Filtering 
is then carried out onto the data records to eliminate 1) 
self-matches that exactly overlap the same position within 

the sequence and  2)  matches below threshold  values, 
such as alignment length, sequence identity and gap size. 
Only  matches  in  the  opposite  direction  to  the  query 
sequences with spacer length below a threshold are then 
reported. Results are represented by a table and an image 
(PDF file) that shows the position of palindromic regions 
on the input sequence scale (Fig. 2). 

We  compared  the  performance  of  PABAP  with 
PALINDROME, a program in publicly available EMBOSS 
package (http://emboss.sourceforge.neU). Time required 
for finding pure palindromic sequences or inverted repeats 
heavily depends on the input sequence length and BLAST 
search parameters (Table 1 ). The most crucial parameter 
determining  sensitivity was  E  value  cutoff;  larger than 
50,000 is recommended for detection of palindromes with 
short  repeat  units.  In  most  cases,  PABAP  surpassed 
PALINDROME in terms of execution speed. PALINDROME 
was best suitable only for identification of true palindromes 
from sequences several kilobases long. Our application 
is  superior  to  PALINDROME  in  finding  symmetrical

duplication at a gene level or inverted repeats flanking a 
genomic sequence that are target sites for site-specific 
recombination. 

We have successfully applied this strategy for finding 
inverted repeats at the end of putative IS elements from 
the  genome  sequence  of a  Corynebacterium  species 
(unpublished  data).  The  strong  point of PABAP lies  in 
faster speed, flexible parameter setting, ability to identify 
inverted repeats with atypical geometry (long repeat units 
or spacers) or low identities,  and  graphical  output that 
enable us to envisage palindromic sequence context at a 
genome level.
