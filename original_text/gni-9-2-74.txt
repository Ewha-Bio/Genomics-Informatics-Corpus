Abstract

Numerous  restraints  and  simplifications  have  been  de-
veloped  for  methods  that  anticipate  protein  structure  to 
reduce  the  colossal  magnitude  of  possible  conforma-
tional  states.  In  this  study,  we  investigated  if  globularity 
is  a  general  characteristic  of  proteins  and  whether  they 
can  be  applied  as  a  valid  constraint  in  protein  structure 
simulations  with  approximated  measurements  (Gb-in-
dex).  Unexpectedly,  most  of  the  proteins  showed  strong 
structural  globularity  (i.e.,  mode  of  approximately  76% 
similarity  to  the  perfect  globe)  with  only  a  few  percent 
of  proteins  being  outliers.  Small  proteins  tended  to  be 
significantly  non-globular  (R2=0.79)  and  the  minimum 
Gb-index  showed  a  logarithmic  increase  with  the  in-
crease  in  protein  size  (R2=0.62),  strongly  implying  that 
the  non-globular  characteristics  might  be  more  accept-
able  for  smaller  proteins  than  larger  ones.  The  strong 
perfect  globe-like  character  and  the  relationship  be-
tween  small  size  and  the  loss  of  globular  structure  of  a 
protein  may  imply  that  living  organisms  have  mecha-
nisms  to  aid  folding  into  the  globular  structure  to  reduce 
irreversible  aggregation.  This  also  implies  the  possible 
mechanisms  of  diseases  caused  by  protein  aggregation, 
including  some  forms  of  trinucleotide  repeat  expan-
sion-mediated  diseases.

Introduction

Protein  structure  is  considered  to  be  the  most  important

pharmaceutical  studies.  The  difficulty,  however,  of  deriv-
ing  structural  information  from  proteins  using  protein 
crystals  or  protein  solutions  leads  to  the  development  of 
protein  structure  prediction  methods  based  on  amino 
acid  sequences  and  other  already  revealed  structures. 
The  most  critical  problem  of  the  protein  structure  antici-
pation  method  is  the  colossal  magnitude  of  possible 
conformational  states.  Numerous  restraints  and  sim-
plifications  have  been  developed  to  be  appropriately  ap-
plied  to  reduce  the  search  space  while  minimizing  false 
structures.

    Recently,  Palù et al.  (2004)  incorporated  globularity  as 

their  protein  folding  simulation  criterion  using  Constraint 
Logic  Programming.  Globularity,  expressed  by  the  radius 
of  gyration,  was  used  to  improve  the  packing  and  accu-
racy of NMR structures in previous research (Kuszewski et 
al.,  1999),  and  the  validity  of  the  globular  restraint  for 
NMR  protein  structure  determination  was  examined  by 
Huang  and  Powers  (2001).  Globularity  was  also  success-
fully  used  to  assess  the  quality  of  models  submitted  to 
the  Critical  Assessment  of  Techniques 
for  Protein 
Structure  Prediction  center  (CASP;  Constantini  et al., 
2007).  Although  protein  globularity  is  assumed  to  be  a 
valid criterion in many studies, to our knowledge, an anal-
ysis  of  the  globularity  of  proteins  investigating  a  whole 
database  of  protein  structures  had  not  been  performed.
    Here,  we  investigated  if  globularity  is  a  general  char-
acter  of  most  proteins  and  whether  it  can  be  applied  as 
a  valid  constraint  in  protein  structure  simulations.  We 
used  virtually  all  the  protein  structures  in  the  Research 
Collaboratory  for  Structural  Bioinformatics’  Protein  Data 
Bank  (RCSB’s  PDB)  database.  We  removed  redundant 
entries  and  divided  the  proteins  into  subcategories  to 
enable  a  more  detailed  analysis. 
    Chaperones  are  known  to  protect  the  aggregation  of 
misfolded  proteins  by  binding  and  aiding  the  recycling 
of  the  folding  process,  especially  in  the  endoplasmic  re-
ticulum  (ER)  during  protein  synthesis.  The  delineation  of 
correct-  and  misfolded  states  by  chaperones  suggests  a 
conundrum  because  many  more  proteins  exist  than 
chaperones  and  related  molecules.  Complete  recog-
nition  of  a  correctly  folded  structure  by  a  structural  pro-
tein-protein  binding  site  interaction  is  almost  impossible 
because  one  protein  might  possess  numerous  structural 
characters.  Accordingly,  a  possibility  exists  that  the 
globular  character  might  be  the  checkpoint  of  the  cor-
rect  folding  in  biological  organisms.  This  assumption  is 
supported  by  the  aggregation  of  misfolded  proteins  be-
cause  non-globular  proteins  tend  to  bind  more  tightly

with  one  another  due  to  the  larger  surface  area  pro-
vided  by  the  loss  of  globularity.
    Unexpectedly,  most  of  the  proteins  showed  strong 
structural  globularity  (i.e.,  mode  of  approximately  76% 
similarity  to  the  perfect  globe)  with  only  a  small  pro-
portion  of  the  proteins  being  outliers.  This  strong  perfect 
globe-like  character  implies  partial  validity  to  the  postu-
lation  that  living  organisms  have  mechanisms  to  aid 
folding  into  globular  structures  to  reduce  irreversible 
aggregation.  It  also  implies  the  possible  mechanisms  of 
protein  aggregation  diseases  including  some  forms  of 
trinucleotide  repeat  expansion-mediated  diseases. 

Methods

Data  sets

PDB  files  were  collected  based  on  the  Structural 
Classification  of  Proteins  (SCOP).  We  used  all-alpha, 
all-beta,  alpha/beta,  alpha＋beta,  multidomain  proteins, 
and  other  minor  proteins  including  peptides,  small  pro-
teins,  and  coiled-coil  proteins.  We  excluded  membrane 
proteins  and  peptides  because  of  their  topological  dif-
ference  and  lipid  membrane  surrounding  environment, 
which  has  different  characteristics  from  that  of  soluble 
proteins.  We  also  excluded  fragmented  and  nucleic 
acid-containing  structures,  but  included  ligand-bound 
proteins.  We  removed  structures  that  have  90%  or  more 
sequence  identity  to  others  to  reduce  redundancy. 
Redundancy  also  arose  from  proteins  with  multiple  folds 
belonging  to  different  sources  of  organisms  or  different 
SCOP  classes.  PDB  entries  with  redundant  source  or-
ganisms  were  removed  but  structures  with  two  or  more 
different  SCOP  classes  were  not  excluded  to  allow  the 

investigation  of  as  many  protein  structures  as  possible.
    In  total,  7,131  PDB  structures  were  analyzed  with 
1,365  all-alpha  chain,  1,503  all-beta  chain,  2,690  al-
pha/beta  chain,  2,067  alpha＋beta  chain,  and  182  multi-
domain  chain  containing  proteins  and  547  other  pro-
teins.  Programs  to  sort  proteins  according  to  their  struc-
tural  classification,  source  of  organism,  oligomeric  sta-
tes,  and  to  filter  out  redundant  and  fragmented  struc-
tures  were  all  written  in  JAVA  language.

Globularity  measurement

We  defined  new  simple  geometric  quantities  to  represent 
globularity  other  than  the  radius  of  gyration  because  the 
radius  of  gyration  might  misinterpret  internal  cavities.  Our 
globularity  index  (Gb-index)  was  defined  as  the  ratio  of 
the  length  of  the  longest  displacement  of  any  two  atoms 
of  the  protein  to  the  average  of  the  longest  lengths  of 
two  displacements  that  are  orthogonal  to  each  other  and 
to  the  longest  displacement.  This  approximated  measure 
was  chosen  because  cubic  proteins  are  assumed  to  be 
extremely  rare  in  real  cases.  The  orthogonal  criterion 
was  surveyed  within  a  2o  span  from  a  perfect  orthogonal 
angle.  A  range  of  2o  was  successful  for  all  the  cases 
tested.  We  calculated  the  mean,  standard  deviation 
(S.D.),  median,  and  the  minimum  and  the  maximum  val-
ues  of  these  indices  of  globularity.  All  the  necessary  pro-
grams  were  written  in  JAVA.

Results  and  Discussion

The  distribution  of  the  degree  of  globularity  was  ana-
lyzed  according  to  the  source  of  organisms  (Fig.  1A) 
and  SCOP  classification  (Fig.  1B).  Except  coiled-coil

proteins  and  peptides,  all  kinds  of  proteins  of  SCOP 
classifications  including  all-alpha,  all-beta,  alpha/beta, 
alpha＋beta,  multidomain,  and  small  proteins  showed 
mean  Gb-indices  from  0.69  to  0.73  and  modes  from 
0.76  to  0.84.  Their  median  values  ranged  from  0.71  to 
0.74.  The  mean  and  mode  of  all  proteins  was  0.71  (S.D. 
0.14)  and  0.76,  respectively,  with  a  median  of  0.72.  The 
mean  Gb-index  of  peptides  was  0.59  (S.D.  0.16)  and  the 
median  was  0.58.  Coiled-coil  proteins  showed  the  low-
est  Gb-index  with  a  mean  of  0.42  (S.D.  0.22)  and  a  me-
dian  of  0.40.  Modes  of  the  Gb-indices  of  peptides  and 
coiled-coil  proteins  were  0.6  and  0.2,  respectively. 
Details  of  the  values  of  each  type  of  protein  are  shown 
in  Table  1.
    No  significant  difference  of  globularity  was  observed 
between  proteins  from  different  organisms.  Gb-indices 
showed  similar  average 
(0.70-0.71)  and  median 
(0.72-0.73)  values  among  proteins  from  different  organ-
isms,  except  viral  proteins,  which  showed  a  slightly  low-
er  average  Gb-index  of  0.67  (S.D.  0.18)  and  median  of 
0.70.  The  modes  of  the  Gb-indices  of  the  proteins  from 
different  organisms  ranged  from  0.72  to  0.76  with  the 
mode  of  0.76  for  the  whole  protein,  0.72  for  archaeal 
and  eukaryotic  proteins,  and  0.76  for  bacterial  and  viral 
proteins.
    Viral  coiled-coil  proteins  gave  a  minimum  Gb-index  of 
0.08  (PDB  ID:  1pjf).  The  mean  Gb-index  of  viral  proteins 
was  slightly  lower  (mean  of  0.67)  compared  to  proteins 
from  other  sources  (mean  of  0.71).  Though  this  devia-
tion  may  have  been  due  to  the  small  sample  size  (234 
entries)  compared  to  other  proteins  (total  of  7,131),  the 
lower  globular  character  might  have  originated  from  the 
abundance  of  structural  capsid  proteins.
    Ninety-five  percent  of  the  proteins  from  any  biological 
source  had  Gb-indices  higher  than  0.453,  and  97%  of 

the  proteins  had  Gb-indices  higher  than  0.413.  This  re-
sult  strongly  indicated  that  almost  every  protein  is  glob-
ular,  partly  validating  previous  attempts  that  used  the 
globularity  criterion  in  anticipating  protein  structures 

(Palù  et al.,  2004).  However,  non-globular,  linear  pro-

teins  were  observed,  as  represented  by  low  Gb-indices, 
which  implies  that  the  folding  criterion  based  on  glob-
ularity  might  not  be  suitable  for  all  cases.  Rather  than 
the  uniform  mathematical  formula  for  the  radius  of  gyra-
tion  according  to  the  length  of  the  polypeptide  chain 
(Skolnick  et al.,  1997),  sequence-  and  other  charac-
ter-based  homology  search  for  expected  globularity 
might  be  more  suitable  for  proteins  with  varying  degrees 
of  globularity.
    A  few  percent  of  non-globular  proteins  existed  al-
though  most  of  the  proteins  were  globular.  We  inves-
tigated  the  possible  relationship  with  the  size  of  the 
protein  and  the  tendency  to  lose  the  globular  structure. 
We  drew  a  graph  of  the  mean,  minimum,  and  max-
imum  Gb-indices  of  proteins  along  with  the  number  of 
atoms  in  the  proteins  (Fig.  2).  In  all  cases,  the  means 
were  always  approximately  0.7  and  the  maximum 
Gb-indices  were  always  just  below  1.0.  However,  the 
minimum  globularity  of  proteins  showed  logarithmic 
growth  with  the  square  correlation  coefficient  (R2)  of 
0.62  to  the  regression  line,  indicating  that  smaller-sized 
proteins  were  more  likely  to  deviate  from  globular 
structures.
    We  also  analyzed  the  relationship  of  the  numbers  of 
proteins  with  globularity  lower  than  0.453,  i.e.,  the  low-
est  5%  of  non-globular  proteins  with  the  size  of  the  pro-
teins  (Fig.  2).  The  findings  showed  that  the  smaller  the 
protein,  the  more  non-globular  in  structure,  with  the 
square  correlation  coefficient  (R2)  of  0.79  for  the  ob-
served  data  and  the  power  regression  line.  This  and  the

Fig.  2.  Change  in  protein  globularity  with  protein  size.  The
mean,  maximum,  and  minimum  Gb-indices  were  plotted 
against  the  atom  numbers  of  proteins.  As  the  atom  number
increased,  the  minimum  globularity  measure  showed  a  log-
arithmic  increase,  indicating  the  square  correlation  co-
efficient  of  0.79  with  the  regression  lines.  The  maximum 
and  mean  values,  however,  stayed  rather  constant  along 
the  whole  range  of  protein  size.  The  relationship  between 
protein  size  and  the  minimal  globularity  index  indicates  that 
non-globular  structure  might  be  more  permissible  in  smaller
proteins.  The  number  of  proteins  with  a  globularity  index 
lower  than  0.453  (the  lowest  5%  of  non-globular  proteins) 
was  also  plotted  against  protein  size.  The  square  correla-
tion  coefficient  of  0.62  was  shown  with  the  decreasing 
power  regression  line,  possibly  indicating  again  that  the 
small  size  permits  less  globular  structures  of  proteins.

logarithmic  increase  in  the  minimum  Gb-index  with  in-
creasing  protein  size  strongly  implied  that  non-globular 
characteristics  might  be  more  acceptable  for  smaller 
proteins  than  larger  ones.
    Calnexin  (Bergeron  et  al.,  1994)  and  calreticulin 
(Michalak  et al.,  1999)  are  chaperones  that  are  known 
to  retain  inappropriately  folded  proteins  in  the  ER.  The 
delineation  of  correct  and  incorrect  folded  proteins  is 
known  to  be  the  function  of  another  ER  enzyme,  gluco-
syl  transferase  (Ellgaard  et al.,  2001).  The  interplay  of 
these  three  key  enzymes  retains  incompletely  folded 
proteins  in  the  ER.  A  significant  portion  of  proteins  in 
the  ER  are  misfolded  and  translocated  back  into  the  cy-
tosol  and  degraded.  (Plemper  and  Wolf,  1999).  How  the 
myriad  of  numbers  of  misfolded  proteins  is  recognized 
individually,  and  why  misfolded  proteins  are  likely  to  ag-
gregate  with  each  other  to  make  plaques  or  crystals  in
side  the  ER,  remains  unclear.
    565  eucaryotic  secretory  proteins,  which  originates 
from  the  rough  ER  and  proceeds  to  Golgi  apparatus, 
showed  mean  Gb-index  of  0.70  (s.d.  0.14)  and  minimum 
and  maximum  Gb-indices  of  0.12  and  0.96  each,  partly 
indicating  that  globularity  might  be  useful  in  preventing 
the  irreversible  aggregation.  31  proteins  (i.e.,  5.49%  of

dex  was  0.2094,  which  belongs  to  the  lowest  0.24%  of 
non-globular  proteins.  This  non-globular  structure  of  the

the  565  proteins)  showed  Gb-index  lower  than  0.453, 
which  is  the  threshold  value  of  the  least  5%  of 
non-globular  proteins.  The  degree  of  globularity  of  these 
proteins  was  as  strong  as,  or  might  have  been  even 
stronger  than  non-secretory  proteins  considering  the 
smaller  sizes  with  mean  atom  number  of  2686  (s.d. 
3285)  than  the  size  of  the  total  proteins  investigated 
with  mean  atom  number  of  4808  (s.d.  5834)  and  the 
correlation  of  the  loss  of  the  globularity  with  protein’s 
small  size.
    The  globular  structure  of  proteins  might  help  prevent 
irreversible  and  pathological  aggregation  because  it  has 
the  minimum  surface  area  of  a  specified  volume.  The 
size  of  the  interacting  surface  area  is  widely  known  to 
strongly  correlate  with  the  binding  strength.  Two  perfect 
globes  will  have  virtually  no  contacting  area  because  of 
the  convex  shapes  of  both.  However,  two  rodlike  pro-
teins  would  line  up  side  by  side  with  the  strong  inter-
action  through  the  long  contactable  area.  The  relation-
ship  between  low  protein  size  and  the  propensity  to 
lose  globular  structures  might  be  explained  by  the 
smaller  contactable  surface  area  of  smaller  proteins 
than  larger  proteins  with  the  same  globularity.
    In  conclusion,  We  investigated  the  degree  of  struc-
tural  globularity  of  proteins  with  an  approximate  meas-
urement.  The  results  strongly  indicated  that  virtually  ev-
ery  protein  (95%)  was  significantly  globe-shaped  with 
Gb-indices  larger  than  0.453.  Some  oddities  were  found 
mainly  among  small  proteins.  The  small  size  of  the  pro-
tein  and  the  tendency  to  have  significantly  non-globular 
structure  showed  a  rather  high  correlation  (R2  =  0.79).

The  minimum  Gb-index  showed  a  logarithmic  increase 
along  the  increase  of  protein  size  (R2  =  0.62).
    The  suggestion  that  globularity  might  function  to  pre-
vent  aggregation  is  somewhat  intriguing  considering  the 
interest  in  protein  aggregation  associated  with  neuro-
degenerative  diseases.  Pathogenic  aggregations  of  pro-
teins  may  have  been  caused  by  the  loss  of  globularity 
of  normal  proteins  or  by  the  overproduction  of  the  pro-
teins  with  low  globularity.  Fig.  3  displays  the  least  glob-
ular  structure  (model  7)  of  the  amyloid-beta  peptide 
(PDB  ID:  1BA4),  which  is  known  to  aggregate  and  make 
plaques  in  neurons  in  Alzheimer’s  disease.  The  Gb-in-
dex  of  this  structure  was  0.2094,  which  is  in  the  small-
est  0.24%  of  the  7,131  proteins  examined.  Although 
confirming  that  the  less  globular  structure  has  a  primary 
effect  on  pathological  aggregation  is  not  sufficient,  one 
can  still  aid  in  the  irreversible  aggregation.  This  supposi-
tion  might  also  be  applied  to  some  form  of  trinucleotide 
repeat  expansion  diseases,  which  also  show  patho-
logical  plaques;  i.e.,  inserted  polyamino  acids  might  in-
duce  the  loss  of  globularity  in  normal  proteins.
    Our  Gb-index  has  shortcomings  in  the  delineation  of 
some  polygonal  structures 
from  globular  proteins. 
Although  most  of  the  polygons  would  be  implausible  for 
real  protein  structures,  cubic  structures  and  other  struc-
tures  with  strongly  planar  or  concave  surfaces  are  still 
possible.  The  analysis  of  the  curvature  of  the  surface  of 
a  protein  would  result  in  a  more  accurate  inference  of 
the  degree  of  globularity  for  these  exceptional  cases. 
Also,  the  search  span  of  2o  for  searching  the  orthogonal 
displacement  to  the  longest  displacement  among  all 
possible  atom  pairs  may  be  too  small  and  might  cause 
the  Gb-index  to  decrease.  Our  finding  regarding  the  dis-
tribution  of  globularity  of  known  protein  structures  can 
be  used  to  suggest  proper  constraints  for  protein  folding 
algorithms.  This  analysis  of  the  simple  physical  charac-
ter  of  protein  structures  might  be  helpful  in  anticipating 

protein  structures.
