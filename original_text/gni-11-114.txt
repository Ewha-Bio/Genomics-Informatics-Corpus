The microbial diversity in soil ecosystems is higher than in any other microbial ecosystem. The majority of soil microorganisms 
has not been characterized, because the dominant members have not been readily culturable on standard cultivation media; 
therefore, the soil ecosystem is a great reservoir for the discovery of novel microbial enzymes and bioactivities. The soil 
metagenome,  the  collective  microbial  genome,  could  be  cloned  and  sequenced  directly  from  soils  to  search  for  novel 
microbial resources. This review summarizes the microbial diversity in soils and the efforts to search for microbial resources 
from the soil metagenome, with more emphasis on the potential of bioprospecting metagenomics and recent discoveries.

Soil Microbial Diversity

In  1898,  a  microbiologist,  Heinrich  Winterberg,  first 
described  that  there  was  a  discrepancy  in  the  number  of 
microorganisms  between  culturable  bacteria  on  nutrient 
media and the total bacteria in nature counted by micro-
scopy.  Since  then,  microbial  unculturability,  the  so-called 
‘great  plate  count  anomaly,’  has  long  been  recognized  in 
microbiology  [1].  While  microbial  unculturability  is  not 
fully understood so far, microbial diversity has been analyzed 
extensively in various environments. This was mostly due to 
the advance of a molecular microbial ecology. The develop-
ment of culture-independent analysis adopted amplification 
and DNA sequencing of microbial signature rRNA sequen-
ces  from  nature  without  cultivation  of  entire  microbial 
species [2]. Therefore, analysis of the microbial phylogenetic 
marker  genes, such  as the  16S rRNA gene, revealed  that 
microorganisms are the true dominant organism in nature 
[3]. The number of prokaryotic cells was estimated to be 4‒6 
×  1030  cells  on  Earth,  and  the  prokaryotes  represent  the 
largest  pool  of  carbon,  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  among 
living  organisms  [4].  Microbial  diversity  has  also  been 
recognized from various soils, and only a small fraction of 
total microbial species in soil (i.e., less than 1%) has been 
characterized by cultivation-based methods [5, 6]. Since the 

majority  of  unculturable  bacteria  in  soil  has  not  been 
cultured [7], it has not been functionally characterized. 

The microbial diversity in soil is probably highest com-
pared to other microbial communities. Culture-independent 
analysis  of  microbial  diversity  in  soil  revealed  that  most 
bacterial  members  abundant  in  soils  are  members  of  the 
phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacterium, Firmicutes, 
and some Verrucomicrobia [8, 9], showing that a large number 
of the 16S rRNA gene clones originated from uncultured 
bacterial  species.  The  abundance  of  the  members  was 
somewhat variable in different types of soil. For example, the 
forest  soils  retained  higher  members  of  the  phylum  Aci 
dobacteria but fewer  β-proteobacterial members [10]. On 
the other hand, agricultural soils harbor higher numbers of 
members  in  β-proteobacteria  but  less  Acidobacteria.  The 
interesting  result  recently  reported  by  Mendes et  al. [11] 
indicated that the relative abundance of bacterial phyla, not 
their profiles, could be important for microbial community 
function in a specific soil, such as disease- suppressive soil. 

Metagenome

The metagenome is the total microbial genome isolated 
directly from microorganisms in nature. The first proposal of 
the term ‘metagenome’ was by Handelsman et al. [12], while

the first approach using environmental DNA was reported in 
1995 to search for genes encoding cellulases [13]. The soil 
metagenome can be isolated directly from various types of 
soil either directly or indirectly without bacterial cultivation 
[14-16]. While the microbial diversities of various microbial 
habitats are being actively investigated by taking advantage 
of next-generation sequencing technology to analyze a large 
number of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences derived from 
a  variety  of  soils  [8],  the  advances  in  bioprospecting 
metagenomics are relatively slow.   

As  a  bioprospecting  purpose,  the  purified  soil  meta-
genomic DNA would be cloned into several different pla-
smid  vectors.  In  general,  high-molecular-weight  DNAs 
cloned  into  fosmid,  cosmid,  or  bacterial  artificial  chro-
mosome (BAC) vectors are introduced into a surrogate host 
bacterium,  such  as  Escherichia  coli  [17].  Especially,  the 
fosmid-based preparation of a metagenomic library is the 
most  frequently  used  strategy,  due  to  their  high  cloning 
efficiency, the improved stability in E. coli, and the feasibility 
to  construct  a  medium-sized  (40  kb)-insert  DNA  library 
[18].  Considering  the  low  frequency  of  finding  genes  for 
novel bioactivities from a soil metagenomic library [19], the 
cloning efficiency is a crucial factor to construct a large clone 
member library. One of the most critical steps for successful 
library  construction  is  the  isolation  of  pure  high-mole-
cular-weight  DNA,  which  is  suitable  for  cloning  into  the 
vectors  [8,  20].  However,  high  contents  of  soil-derived 
humic  acids  are  co-purified  during  the  high-molecular- 
weight  DNA  isolation  process,  and  humic  acids  interfere 
with the cloning process of high-molecular-weight DNA into 
a vector. Various methods to remove humic acids during soil 
metagenomic  DNA  purification  usually  end  up  with  the 
recovery of relatively low-molecular-weight DNA, which is 
not suitable to clone into a fosmid or BAC. Several com-
mercial kits would be plausible to purify soil metagenomic 
DNA  for  the  amplification  purpose  of  16S  rRNA  genes, 
which  will  be  subsequently  used  for  microbial  diversity 
analysis. However, the sizes of DNA fragments isolated by 
most of the commercial kits are rather small to clone into 
vectors,  such  as  fosmids  and  BACs.  Therefore,  optimal 
methods for the direct isolation of high-molecular-weight 
DNA  from  soil  have  been  developed  and  used  for  bio-
prospecting metagenomics [14, 16, 20]. Although obtaining 
a  large  number  of  metagenomic  clones  from  soil  is  a 
prerequisite to search for novel microbial genes from soil, 
the technologies for metagenomic library construction were 
generalized  using  fosmids  and  cosmids.  Various  novel 
microbial  resources  could  be  expected  from  soil  meta-
genomic libraries, because soils bear the highest microbial 
diversity compared to any other microbial community.

Tapping soil metagenome

Since functional metagenomics (or bioprospecting meta-
genomics)  was  attempted  from  a  soil  ecosystem  [17],  a 
number  of  microbial  genes  encoding  novel  enzymes  or 
bioactive compounds have been identified and characterized 
[21, 22]. Here, we summarize several technical points to be 
considered for bioprospecting metagenomics and the major 
results of novel enzymes and bioactivities from the soil me-
tagenome.

Screening strategies and high-throughput screening 
(HTS)

Metagenomic  libraries  with  either  large-insert  DNA  or 
small-insert DNA were used to search for novel microbial 
genes. The library with the small-insert DNA could be fea-
sible to identify novel enzymes, while that with the large- 
insert DNA is also frequently used [23]. Screening of both 
types  of  metagenomic  libraries  has  been  conducted  and 
successfully identified many novel enzymes and bioactivities 
[21].  Two  different  approaches  for  screening  the  meta-
genomic  libraries  are  frequently  used,  such  as  function- 
based  (expression-dependent)  screening  and  sequence- 
based (homology-dependent) screening. 

Function-based screening is dependent on the expression 
of metagenomic genes in a surrogate host, such as E. coli, and 
subsequently  detects  metabolic  activities  in  the  hete-
rologous  host.  Therefore,  the  proper  expression  of  meta-
genomic genes is essential to detect the phenotypic charac-
teristics of the desired activity by the function-based screen-
ing approach. It is arguable that the majority of genes from 
uncultured  soil  microorganisms  would  not  be  expressed 
properly in a host bacterium. There has been no extensive 
analysis to assess the expression ratio of metagenomic genes 
in  defined  culturable  bacteria.  In  spite  of  the  expression 
barrier  of  cloned  metagenomic  genes  in  E.  coli,  the  func-
tion-driven approach has proven to be feasible to search for 
novel  genes  and  gene  products  [22].  Recently,  function- 
based  screening  approaches  have  been  advanced  and 
modified to search for novel microbial genes compared with 
the original approach－i.e., the direct detection of metabolic 
function [17]. Host strains or mutants were used to identify 
genes for functional complementation in trans by metage-
nomic clones [24], and another advance in function-based 
screening  was combined  with HTS  to  detect  the  induced 
gene  expression  in  a  host  bacterium  with  substrates, 
autoinducers, and metabolic products provided exogenously 
[25-27]. One of the approaches to overcome the host ex-
pression barrier is to develop a broad-host range vector to 
express a metagenomic library in a variety of host bacteria. 
This  approach,  in  fact,  is  promising  and  nourishing  the

function-based screening of metagenomics to obtain diverse 
microbial resources for enzymes and biomolecules [28].  

The  sequence-based  approach  is  to  screen  for  marker 
genes using DNA probe or PCR primers designed from DNA 
sequences  of  already  known  genes.  Since  this  approach 
would detect gene variants with the conserved motif from 
the metagenome, it is arguable if this approach would really 
screen  true  novel  genes  from  microbial  diversity.  Never-
theless,  there  are  a  number  of  examples  with  some  suc-
cessful identification of novel microbial enzymes [22, 29]. A 
recent  approach  with  sequence-based  screening  is  taking 
advantage of the advances in next-generation sequencing. 
Direct sequencing of metagenomic DNA by next-generation 
sequencing is now used increasingly to study gene inven-
tories  in  the  metagenomes  of  specific  microbial  com-
munities  [30].  Direct  sequencing  of  a  metagenome  ge-
nerates a large dataset, which should be analyzed by support 
of the appropriate informatics. Analysis of the soil meta-
genome by the sequencing-based approach is still a huge 
challenge, since the soil microbial community is the most 
complicated one with the highest microbial diversity com-
pared with any other microbial community. A combination 
of appropriate bioinformatics, such as comparative sequence 
analysis, with the large set of soil metagenome sequences 
will be a new opportunity to search for microbial enzymes 
and novel bioactivities in the future [31]. HTS is another 
issue  for  bioprospecting  metagenomics  with  the  direct 
sequencing of the metagenome. If both function-based and 
sequence-based  screening  is  combined  with  HTS,  novel 
microbial enzymes and bioactivities would be detected at 
higher  frequency  compared  with  conventional  screening. 
This is mainly because the large numbers of metagenomic 
clones in libraries should be searched for novel enzymes and 
biomolecules to tap the great soil microbial diversity. Some 
of the recently adopted HTS methods for drug discovery may 
enable  the  discovery  of  novel  enzymes  and  biomolecules 
from the soil metagenome. Multidisciplinary efforts, com-
bined with bioinformatics, analytical chemistry, and high- 
throughput  technology,  is  required  to  search  for  novel 
enzymes and bioactivities from soil metagenomes.

Novel enzymes from soil metagenome

Many novel enzymes were identified from various meta-
genomic studies, and we summarized the examples of enzy-
me recovery from soil metagenome studies in Table 1 [10, 
32-58]. One of the most prevailing novel enzymes found 
from  the  soil  metagenome  is  esterase/lipase.  Lipolytic 
enzymes, such as esterases and lipases, are important bio-
catalysts for biotechnological applications. The interesting 
features  of  lipolytic  enzymes  include  no  requirement  for 
cofactors,  remarkable  stability  in  organic  solvents,  broad 

substrate specificity, stereoselectivity, and positional selec-
tivity [23]. The features of lipolytic enzymes are especially 
attractive for organic synthesis if the enzymes with specific 
chiral  resolution  could  be  retrieved  from  the  soil  meta-
genome. Therefore, the discovery of novel lipolytic enzymes 
from  the  soil  metagenome  has  received  much  attention 
compared  to  other  enzymes.  Considering  that  lipolytic 
enzymes are the most well characterized and highly studied 
enzymes  among  biocatalysts,  the  finding  of  several  novel 
families of esterase/lipase enzymes is quite surprising. One 
of our previous results with EstD2 revealed that EstD2 was 
not similar to any previously described enzymes, while the 
enzyme  clearly  displayed  esterase  activity  [39].  A  similar 
protein found in the GenBank database also exhibited the 
same  activity,  while  it  was  initially  annotated  as  a  hy-
pothetical protein. Therefore, function-driven selection of 
EstD2  constituted  a  novel  family  of  esterases  and  re-an-
notated  many  proteins  as  esterase/lipases  that  were  pre-
viously known as hypothetical proteins. Similar studies with 
enzymes found in the soil metagenome suggested that soil 
microbial  diversity  truly  bears  the  great  extent  of  novel 
microbial enzymes. 

Cellulolytic  enzymes  and  cell  wall-degrading  enzymes 
(CWDEs)  of  plant  cells  are  also  enzymes  with  biotech-
nological interest, mostly due to biomass degradation, with 
the  purpose  of  bioenergy  production.  In  contrast  to  the 
enzymatic  interest,  the  identification  of  novel  cellulolytic 
enzymes  or  other  CWDEs  is  not  well  documented.  The 
reason for the rare recovery of cellulases and CWDEs is poor 
secretion of these enzymes in E. coli, the major host bacteria, 
and incompatible detection methods of enzymatic activity 
for a large member of metagenomic libraries from the soil 
metagenome. For the successful detection of cellulases and 
CWDEs, technical elaboration with HTS would be necessary 
to  enhance  the  detection  of  proper  enzyme  activity.  Bio-
informatics, such as comparative sequence analysis of the 
metagenome, could be another choice to identify cellulolytic 
enzymes and CWDEs from massive datasets derived from 
direct  sequencing  of  the  soil  metagenome.  A  number  of 
enzymes  for  other  carbohydrate  metabolism  and  a  few 
lactonases were also detected from the soil metagenome, 
and they are listed in Table 1. However, many enzymes are 
not feasible to detection by simply screening for the bacterial 
phenotypic  changes,  while  the  lipolytic  enzymes  were 
simply  identified  by  tributyrin  hydrolysis  on  culture  me-
dium.  

Bioactivities from soil metagenome

In addition to the novel enzymes, soil metagenomes are 
rich sources of a variety of small molecules with bioactivities, 
such  as  antibiotics  and  other  pharmaceutically  applicable

activities.  The  search  for  novel  bioactivities  is  primarily 
based on the phenotypic detection of bacterial traits of the 
host bacteria bearing metagenomic libraries. Antagonistic 
activity and colony color changes of the host bacterium are 
typical examples to detect metagenomic clones, potentially 
associated  with  novel  secondary  metabolite  production. 
However, the conventional approach exhibits a rarer chance 
to  identify  novel  gene  clusters  and  bioactivities  [19]. 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop new detection strategies 
for  novel  bioactivities  from  the  soil  metagenome.  None-
theless, the simple detection of antibiosis or color changes of 
the  host  bacterial  colonies  with  metagenomic  clones 
brought  some  interesting  results,  suggesting  the  great 
potential of novel bioactivities from the soil metagenome. 

We  summarize  the  identified  bioactivities  and  their  gene 
clusters  from  the  soil  metagenome  in  Table  2.  These 
bioactivities  include  antibacterial  turbomycins,  glycopep-
tides,  cyanobactins,  type  II  polyketides,  trans-acyltrans-
ferase polyketides, and the anticancer agent ET-743 [21]. 
Some of the bioactivities from the soil metagenome may also 
be discovered by homology-based screening. Whole meta-
genome sequences from soil, which will be accomplished in 
the future, would be a rich source to be probed to identify 
gene clusters for bioactive compound production.

in  sequencing  technology,  and  the  proper  bioinformatics
