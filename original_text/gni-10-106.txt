Pulse rate is known to be related to diverse phenotypes, such as cardiovascular diseases, lifespan, arrhythmia, hypertension, 
lipids, diabetes, and menopause. We have reported two genomewide significant genetic loci responsible for the variation in 
pulse rate as a part of the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, the genomewide association study (GWAS) that was 
conducted with 352,228 single nucleoride polymorphisms typed in 8,842 subjects in the Korean population. GJA1 was 
implied as a functionally causal gene for pulse rate from the KARE study, but lacked evidence of replication. To re-evaluate the 
association  of  a  locus  near  GJA1  with  pulse  rate,  we  looked  up  this  signal  in  another  GWAS  conducted  in  a  Health 
Examinee-shared cohort of 3,703 samples. Not only we were able to confirm two pulse rate loci (1q32.2a near CD46 and 
6q22.13c near LOCL644502) identified in the KARE GWAS, we also replicated a locus (6q22.31c) near GJA1 by the lookup in 
the Health Examinee GWAS. Considering that the GJA1-encoded protein is a major component of cardiac gap junctions, a 
functional study might be necessary to validate its genuine molecular biological role in the synchronized contraction of the 
heart.

Introduction

Pulse  rate,  also  called  heart  rate,  is  the  number  of 
heartbeats per unit of time, commonly used as beats per 
minute (BPM). Pulse rate is varied in accordance with the 
body’s need for oxygen changes, such as during exercise or 
sleep. Since various health-related phenotypes are closely 
correlated  with  pulse  rate  [1-3],  measuring  pulse  rate  is 
commonly  used  for  diagnosing  and  accessing  medical 
conditions. 

Pulse  rate  is  known  to  be  positively  correlated  with 
triglycerides  and  negatively  correlated  with  high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol [3]. Numerous studies have reported 
an  association  between  heart  rate  and  total  and/or 
cardiovascular mortality [1]. Metabolic syndrome is asso-
ciated  with  poor  exercise  capacity  and  poor  heart  rate 
recovery  in  patients  who  have  coronary  disease  [4]. 
Moreover,  high  pulse  rate  is  negatively  correlated  with 
lifespan in mammals, including humans [2]. 

Despite the importance of pulse rate as a risk factor for 
various  diseases,  however,  few  genes  are  known  to  be 
associated with pulse rate, and the underlying mechanism 
for pulse rate remains unraveled. We previously reported 
pulse  rate-associated  loci  from  the  Korea  Association 
Resource (KARE) genomewide association study (GWAS), 
comprising 8,842 samples in the Korean population [5]. In 
this study, we extended the previous study and reexamined 
the  relevance  of  pulse  rate-associated  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) from an additional GWAS of 3,703 
Korean samples.

Methods
Subjects

In the discovery stage, the association results for pulse 
rate were obtained from the KARE study. The information 
for subjects of the KARE GWAS is described elsewhere [5]. 
Subjects for the replication stage were recruited from the

Health Examinee cohorts, called HEXA-shared cohorts. The 
standardized examinations that were applied in this survey 
included  4,302  participants  aged  40  to  70  years.  The 
characteristics of the cohorts are described in Table 1.

The measurement of pulse rate

Pulse rate is the frequency of the heart beat (BPM). Pulse 
rate of KARE was measured 3 times while the participant 
was  lying  down,  and  the  average  value  was  used  for  the 
analysis (before the first measurement, participants rested 
for  5  min,  and  3  measurements  were  taken  at  least  30  s 
apart). In HEXA-shared cohorts, the first measurement of 
the participants, who rested for 5 min, was used. 

Genotyping and quality control

The methods for genotyping and quality control for the 
KARE GWAS have been described elsewhere [5]. For the 
HEXA  GWAS,  genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  4,302 
participants  from  an  urban  cohort  and  genotyped  with 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  6.0  (Affy-
metrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). From 4,302 genotyped 
samples, we excluded samples with a low call rate (≥ 95%, 
n = 443), high heterozygosity (n = 25), outliers (n = 26), 
and gender inconsistencies (n = 8), and those obtained from 
individuals who had developed any kind of cancer (n = 61) 
were excluded from subsequent analyses, along with related 
or identical individuals whose computed average pairwise 
identity-by-state value was higher than that estimated from 
cryptic  first-degree  relatives  of  samples  (n  =  33).  SNP 
markers with a high missing genotype rate (＞ 5%), minor 
allele frequency (MAF) (＜ 0.01), and significant deviation 
from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p  ＜ 1  ×  10－6)  were 
excluded, leaving a total of 627,659 markers to be examined 
in 3,703 individuals.

Statistical analysis 

Association  analyses  were  performed  using  PLINK 
(http://pngu.mgh.harvared.edu/~purcell/plink/) [6], SAS 
version  9.2  (SAS  institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA),  and  R 
statistics  package  (version  2.7.1)  (http://r-project.org/). 
The  SNP  association  for  pulse  rate  was  tested  by  linear 
regression analysis with an additive model, adjusting for age, 
sex, and recruitment area. The KARE GWAS and replication 
GWAS were combined by an inverse-variance meta-analysis 
method, assuming fixed effects, with Cochran’s Q test used 
to  assess  between-study  heterogeneity  [7].  Meta-analysis 
calculations  were  performed  using  METAL  (http://www. 
sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal)  in  the  R  program 
(version 2.7.1).

Results

The  discovery  GWAS  for  pulse  rate  included  352,225 
SNPs profiled with Affymetrix Genome-Wide human SNP 
array 5.0 in 8,842 individuals from the Ansung and Ansan 
cohorts as described previously [5]. Characteristics of the 
study, including age, sex, and trait summaries, are presented 
in  Table  1.  The  association  analysis  identified  several 
genomic locations as potentially associated with pulse rate. 
Unlike the previous GWAS [5], we did not apply a threshold 
with a p ＜ 0.01 in both Ansung and Ansan cohort in addition 
to a combined p ＜ 1 × 10－5 for the SNP selection for the 
replication study so that we could include more promising 
SNPs for their association with pulse rate. We observed 61 
significant  SNPs  by  applying  only  a  threshold  with  a 
combined p ＜ 1 × 10－5. After excluding SNPs by cluster plot 
inspection  and  removing  singletons,  3  independent  SNPs 
(that is, with pairwise linkage disequilibrium statistics r2 ＜ 
0.2 and MAF ≥ 0.05 within a 500-kb window of the genomic 
region) were finally chosen to validate in the independent 
population  -  i.e.,  the  HEXA  cohort,  comprising  3,703 
individuals.  In  the  replication  study,  all  3  SNPs  were 
confirmed for their association with pulse rate at a p ＜ 0.05 
(Table 2). 

The first pulse rate signal located to 1q32.2a (rs12731740, 
MAF = 0.103, poverall = 2.20 × 10－8). Three genes, such as 
CD46, Clorf132, and CD34, appear near this locus [5]. The 
physiological relevance of the 3 genes in relation to pulse rate 
is not clear [8, 9]. Thus, fine mapping surrounding this locus 
by targeted resequencing is highly recommended to discover 
the causal variants for pulse rate. The second pulse rate SNP 
is rs12110693 (MAF = 0.494, poverall = 1.10 × 10－8) on 
6q22.31c. The only gene located near this SNP is 
LOC644502, which has no known function. The third locus 
associated with pulse rate is at 6q22.31c (rs2892767, MAF = 
0.261, poverall = 2.50 × 10－7). This locus is near GJA1 (Gap 
junction protein, alpha 1, 43 kDa), which is a member of the 
connexin gene family. The protein encoded by GJA1 is a 
component of gap junctions, which are intercellular 
channels that provide a route for the diffusion of low-

Discussion

In this study, we performed a genomewide scan for pulse 
rate and identified 3 loci accounting for the variation in pulse 
rate. Two of 3 loci were previously reported and replicated 
once  again  in  an  independent  HEXA-shared  cohort.  The 
other one (rs2892767) near GJA1 was previously implicated 
for its association with pulse rate but was not chosen for the 
replication study, since the SNP did not meet the selection 
criteria in the discovery stage [5]. In the present study, SNP 
rs2892767 near GJA1 was taken forward to the replication 
study using the independent dataset from the HEXA-shared 
cohort  and  was  nicely  confirmed  for  its  association  with 
pulse rate. 

Two  SNPs, rs2892767  near  GJA1  and  rs12110693  near 
LOC644502, are 408 kb apart from each other and are located 
in a separate LD, indicating that both are independent SNPs. 
The independence between both SNPs was further tested by 
conditional analyses. We performed multiple linear regres-
sion analyses, conditioning the SNPs to each other to find a 
significantly  stronger  proxy  for  pulse  rate.  However,  no 
dramatic decrease in statistical significance was observed, 
and  no  interaction  was  found  between  rs2892767  and 
rs12110693 (Table 3). These results further validate that the 
2 SNPs are independent of each other. 

Gap junctions are thought to have a crucial role in the 
synchronized  contraction  of  the  heart  and  in  embryonic 
development. It is also known that gap junctions, clusters of 
cell-to-cell  channels  composed  of  connexins, mediate the 
orderly spread of electrical excitation throughout the heart 
[10]. The GJA1-encoding protein has been reported to be 
involved in the development and function of the heart by 
allowing  direct  cell-to-cell  exchange  of  molecules,  which 
mediate multiple signaling events [11]. Mutations in GJA1 
cause Mendelian inherited hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
[12]. Cho et al. [5] previously reported the same locus near 
GJA1 to be responsible for pulse rate without evidence of 
replication. In the present study, we successfully replicated

the locus in an independent replication study.

As indicated from the functional role of GJA1, it is a strong 
candidate gene for pulse rate. Thus, further efforts, such as 
fine mapping or imputation based on large-scale sequencing 
data near rs2892767 on 6q22.31, would reveal the causal 
variant of this locus. In addition, functional studies for GJA1 
would be worthwhile to facilitate a full understanding of its 
biological role in pulse rate. 

Our  study  was  relatively  underpowered  to  discover 
additional  novel  loci  and  demonstrated  that  large-scale 
genomewide meta-analysis comprising hundreds of thou-
sands  samples  is  required  for  understanding  the  missing 
heritability of pulse rate.
