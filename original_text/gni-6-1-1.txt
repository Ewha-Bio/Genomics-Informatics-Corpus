Abstract

The  widespread  presence  of  large-scale  genomic  varia-
tions,  termed  copy  number  variation  (CNVs),  has  been 
recently  recognized  in  phenotypically  normal  individuals. 
Judging  by  the  growing  number  of  reports  on  CNVs,  it 
is  now  evident  that  these  variants  contribute  significantly 
to  genetic  diversity  in  the  human  genome.  Like  single 
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs),  CNVs  are  expected 
to  serve  as  potential  biomarkers  for  disease  suscepti-
bility  or  drug  responses.  However,  the  technical  and 
practical  concerns  still  remain  to  be  tackled.  In  this  re-
view,  we  examine  the  current  status  of  CNV  DBs  and 
research,  including  the  ongoing  efforts  of  CNV  screening 
in  the  human  genome.  We  also  discuss  the  character-
istics  of  platforms  that  are  available  at  the  moment  and 
suggest  the  potential  of  CNVs  in  clinical  research  and 
application.

Introduction

Traditionally,  large-scale  genomic  variants  that  are  visi-
ble  in  conventional  karyotyping  have  been  thought  to  be 
associated  with  early-onset,  highly  penetrant  genetic 
disorders,  while  they  are  incompatible  in  normal,  dis-
ease-free  individuals  (Lupski,  1998;  Stankiewicz  and 
Lupski,  2002).  The  construction  of  the  'reference  ge-
nome'  by  the  human  genome  sequencing  project  is 
based  on  the  belief  that  human  genome  sequences  are 
virtually  identical,  even  in  different  individuals,  except  for 
well-known  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNP)  or 
size-variants  of  tandem  repeats  such  as  mini-  or  micro-

satellites  (variable  number  of  tandem  repeats  or  VNTR) 
(Przeworski  et al.,  2000).  This  traditional  concept  has 
been  recently  challenged  by  the  discovery  that  large 
structural  variations  are  more  prevalent  than  previously 
presumed  (Check,  2005).  Using  high-resolution  whole- 
genome  scanning  technologies  such  as  array-based 
comparative  genomic  hybridization  (array-CGH),  two 
groups  of  pioneering  scientists  have  identified  wide-
spread  copy  number  variations  (CNVs)  in  apparently 
healthy,  normal  individuals  (Iafrate et al.,  2004;  Sebat et 
al.,  2004).  It  proposes  that  our  genome  is  more  diverse 
than  has  ever  been  recognized,  and  subsequent  studies 
have  identified  up  to  11,000  CNVs  across  the  whole  ge-
nome  (Tuzun et al.,  2005;  Hinds et al.,  2006;  Mills et al., 
2006;  McCarroll et al.,  2006;  Conrad et al.,  2006;  Sharp 
et al.,  2005;  Wong et al.,  2007;  de  Smith et al.,  2007). 
    Although  the  current  understanding  of  CNVs  is  still 
limited  for  practical  use  and  technical  challenges  still  re-
main  to  be  tackled,  recent  studies  already  have  demon-
strated  the  potential  association  of  CNVs  with  various 
diseases,  suggesting  plausible  functional  significances 
and  highlighting  the  promising  utility  of  CNVs.
    The  current  coverage  of  CNVs  in  the  human  genome 
already  has  exceeded  that  of  SNPs  (approximately  600 
Mb  comprising  ∼12%  of  human  genome)  and  is  still  in-
creasing  (Cooper et al.,  2007).  These  large-scale  struc-
tural  variants,  in  addition  to  SNPs,  will  serve  as  powerful 
sources  to  help  our  understanding  of  human  genetic 
variation  and  of  differences  in  disease  susceptibility  for 
various  diseases.  This  paper  reviews  the  current  knowl-
edge  and  future  perspectives  of  CNVs. 

The  definition  of  CNV

Structural  variations  that  involve  large  DNA  segments 
can  take  various  forms,  such  as  duplication,  deletion,  in-
sertion,  inversion,  and  translocation.  Among  them,  DNA 
copy  number  variations  larger  than  1  kb  are  collectively 
termed  CNVs.  Fig.  1  illustrates  the  concept  of  CNV. 
Although  the  CNV  can  include  large,  microscopically 
visible  genomic  variations,  it  generally  indicates  a  sub-
microscopic  structural  variation  that  is  hardly  detectable 
by  conventional  karyotyping  (3∼5  Mb)  (Freeman et al., 
2006).  Smaller  variations  such  as  small  insertional-  dele-
tion  (indel)  polymorphisms  are  not  included  in  CNVs, 
while  they  comprise  another  large  collection  of  over

Fig.  1.  Concept  of  inter-individual  copy  number  variations.  Most  humans  have  two  copies  of  DNA/gene  (diploid,  2n),  each
originating  from  the  maternal  (n)  and  paternal  (n)  genome.  However,  some  of  the  DNA  regions/genes  are  not  diploid,  showing
variable  numbers  of  copies.  These  variable  copies  are  mainly  inherited  but  partly  can  be  gained de novo.  This  phenomenon 
is  termed  copy  number  variation  (CNV).  Such  CNVs  may  affect  gene  expressions  through  dosage  imbalance  of  genes.

400,000  variants  in  the  human  genome  (Mills  et al., 
2006),  and    neither  is  the  insertional  polymorphism  of 
mobile  elements  such  as  Alus  or  L1  elements  consid-
ered  a  CNV. 
    At  the  beginning  stages  of  CNV  discovery,  a  number 
of  terms  were  proposed  to  define  them e.g.,  large-scale 
copy  number  variants  (LCV)  (Iafrate  et al.,  2004),  copy 
number  polymorphism  (CNP)  (Sebat  et al.,  2004),  and 
intermediate-sized  variants  (ISV)  (Tuzun  et al.,  2005). 
The  current  definition  of  CNV  is  also  operational  and 
can  be  modified  with  the  advance  of  scanning  resolution 
and  coverage,  and  availability  of  allele  frequency  in  a 
determined  population.

The  identification  of  CNVs  using  differ-
ent  platforms

Various  scanning  platforms  and  quality  control  methods 
have  been  used  to  identify  CNV  calls.  Because  the 
choice  of  platforms  has  a  great  effect  on  the  results,  it 
is  worth  reviewing  the  characteristics  of  platforms  to  im-
prove  the  understanding  of  CNVs.
    The  presence  of  CNVs  in  normal  individuals  was  re-
ported  for  the  first  time  in  2004  independently  by  two 

groups  led  by  Lee  C.  and  Wigler  M.  (Iafrate et al.,  2004; 
Sebat  et al.,  2004).  Both  studies  used  two-dye  ar-
ray-CGH  techniques  that  used  clones  of  bacterial  artifi-
cial  chromosomes  (BAC)  or  oligonucleotides  (representa-
tional  oligonucleotide  microarray  analysis,  or  ROMA). 
They  independently  reported  about  250  and  80  loci  as 
changes  in  copy  number  from  39  and  20  normal  in-
dividuals,  respectively.  Fig.  2  illustrates  the  general  con-
cept  of  CNV  detection  based  on  two-dye  array-CGH. 
Although  the  average  numbers  of  CNVs  per  individual 
genome  were  similar  in  two  studies  (about  12  CNVs  per 
genome),  it  should  be  noted  that  there  was  little  overlap 
between  the  results.  This  discrepancy  between  studies 
was  possibly  due  to  the  use  of  different  platforms  and 
experimental 
in  different  populations. 
However,  it  is  also  probable  that  there  are  still  large 
numbers  of  structural  variants  that  have  yet  to  be  dis-
covered  (Buckley  et al.,  2005;  Eichler,  2006).
    One  following  study  that  provided  evidence  on  the 
widespread  presence  of  large-scale  structural  variations 
in  the  human  genome  was  based  solely  on  in  silico 
analysis  (Tuzun  et al.,  2005).  The  sequence-level  com-
parison  of  two  independent  genome  sequences,  i.e., 
one  derived  from  a  human  genome  reference  assembly

ful  to  get  reliable  interpretation  of  CNVs.  Both  individual  DNAs  are  labeled  with  Cy3  and  Cy5,  respectively,  and  co-hybridized.
Then,  the  same  experiment  is  repeated  by  switching  the  dyes  ('dye-swap').  When  both  dye-swap  profiles  show  peaks  beyond 
the  cutoff  and  inverted  peaks  of  similar  intensity  at  the  same  location  simultaneously,  we  interpret  them  as  true  CNVs.

and  the  other  from  fosmid  clones  of  a  genomic  library, 
revealed  about  300  structural  variations, 
including 
inversions.  This  method  can  detect  various  types  of 
structural  variants,  including  inversion,  which  is  not  de-
tectable  by  conventional  array-CGH  platforms.  Indeed, 
the  results  by  Tuzun et al.  (2005)  can  be  used  as  vali-
dated  control  for  primary  verification  or  for  parameter 
tuning  for  the  development  of  CNV-detection  platforms 
or  algorithms.  Although  the  use  of  this  method  is  cur-
rently  limited  by  the  unavailability  of  sequence  data,  on-
going  efforts  to  sequence  the  individual  human  genome 
and  to  develop  cost-effective  sequencing  platforms 
(Bennett  et al.,  2005)  will  be  able  to  facilitate  se-
quence-level  genome  comparisons  and  the  identification 
of  highly  qualified  structural  variants  in  the  near  future.
    Two  studies  by  McCarroll  et al.  and  Conrad  et al., 
which  focused  on  the  identification  of  deletion  variants 
(McCarroll  et al.,  2006;  Conrad  et al.,  2006),  used  1.2 

million  SNP  genotyping  data  from  The  International 
HapMap  Consortium  (International  HapMap  Consortium. 
2005).  They  assumed  that  allelic  deletion  causes  the 
discard  of  probes  in  SNP  genotyping.  For  example,  the 
runs  of  consecutive  probes  with  null  genotype  calls  or 
runs  of  SNP  genotypes  whose  allelic  frequencies  deviate 
from  expected  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  ratios  or  ex-
pected  Mendelian  inheritance  patterns  might  represent 
the  presence  of  deleted  loci.  They  independently  re-
ported  about  600  potential  deletions  as  small  as  less 
than  100  bp.  The  relatively  small  size  of  the  identified 
variants,  compared  with  the  array-CGH  method,  is  due 
to  the  high  resolution  of  the  platforms.  The  use  of  an 
SNP-centric  array  platform  can  be  used  to  identify  link-
age  disequilibrium  (LD)  of  structural  variants  with  nearby 
SNPs  in  a  given  population.  But,  the  discrepancy  in  de-
letions  that  were  identified  in  the  two  studies  was  also 
noted  in  spite  of  using  similar  HapMap  populations  and 

4    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  6(1)  1-7,  March  2008

identification  methods  (Eichler  2006). 
    Recently,  a  comprehensive  CNV  analysis  was  re-
ported  based  on  high-resolution  array  platforms,  Whole 
Genome  TilePath  (WGTP),  which  used  26,000  large  in-
sert  clones,  and  Affymetric  GeneChip  Human  Mapping 
500K  early  access,  which  used  500,000  SNP  oligonu-
cleotides.  They  identified  about  1500  genomic  segments 
as  copy  number  variations  or  CNVRs  (copy  number  vari-
able  regions)  consisting  of  overlapping  CNVs  from  269 
HapMap  individuals  (Redon  et al.,  2006).  The  results 
from  the  two  platforms  are  worth  comparing  becasuse 
they  provide  the  highest  currently  achievable  resolution 
and  are  often  selected  as  primary  platforms  in  many 
other  studies.  Firstly,  the  CNVs  that  are  identified  from 
BAC-based  array-CGH  are  generally  larger  than  those 
from  oligonucleotide-based  arrays  (230  kb  and  80  kb  of 
median  size,  respectively).  This  overestimation  of  CNVs 
by  BAC-based  array-CGH  is  due  to  the  large  insert 
clones  that  are  used,  which  has  been  frequently  re-
ported  (Iafrate et al.,  2006).  Secondly,  the  actual  boun-
daries  of  structural  variants  can  not  be  determined 
through  BAC-based  array-CGH.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
more  accurate  determination  of  variant  boundaries  can 
be  achieved  through  SNP-centric  oligonucleotide-based 
arrays  that  have  an  extensive  number  of  oligonucleo-
tides.  The  SNP-centric  platform  has  additional  advan-
tages  of  accompanying  SNP  genotype  information  as  a 
potential  variant  source,  combined  with  large  structural 
variants  and  its  ability  to  detect  the  presence  of  loss  of 
heterozygosity  (LOH)  or  segmental  uniparental  disomy 
(Bruce et al.,  2005;  Mei et al.,  2000).  But,  the  SNP-cen-

tric  platform  also  has  its  disadvantages.  In  spite  of  the 
advanced  resolution,  the  relatively  low  signal-to-noise 
ratio  of  oligonucleotide-based  hybridization  intensity, 
compared  with  large  insert  clone  array,  might  result  in 
higher  false-positive  rates.  Because  most  CNVs  are  sub-
tle  changes,  this  makes  the  results  prone  to  mis-
classification  of  signal  intensities  and,  consequently,  to 
statistical  errors. 
    Sometimes,  it  is  pointed  out  that  the  SNP-centric  ar-
ray  was  originally  designed  for  allelic  discrimination  and 
is  not  appropriate  for  CNV  detection  because  of  biased 
genomic  distribution  and  sequence  composition  of  spot-
ted  probes  (McCarroll  and  Altshuler  2007d).  Recently 
proposed  oligonucleotide-based  array  platforms  have 
been  designed  for  CNV  detection  specifically  without 
sacrificing  the  advantage  of  high  resolution,  which  can 
be  a  promising  solution  for  CNV  detection  in  the  near 
future  (Barrett  et al.,  2004). 
    In  identifying  CNVs  in  normal  populations,  one  of  the 
fundamental  problems  is  the  lack  of  a  reference  genome 
from  which  diploid  states  of  sample  DNA  can  be 
inferred.  Unlike  the  array-CGH-based  tumor  study  in 
which  the  normal  DNA  of  the  same  individual  can  be 
used  as  a  reference  genome,  no  single  DNA  source  can 
present  the  standardized  and  universal  genome  in  var-
iant  analysis.  Often,  the  pooled  genome  of  several  in-
dividuals  has  been  used  to  represent  the  average  ge-
nome,  while  the  heterogeneity  of  the  used  population 
might  affect  the  copy  number  inference  step,  as  shown 
for  examples  of  X  chromosomes.  Redon  et al.  and 
Komura et al.  adopted  the  pairwise  comparison  for  ac-

Clinical  implications  of  CNVs  and  dis-
ease  association  study

In  spite  of  recent  technological  developments  of  genetic 
polymorphism-oriented  disease  association  studies,  still 
little  is  known  about  the  effects  of  genetic  poly-
morphisms  on  common  complex  diseases.  One  of  the 
ultimate  goals  in  exploring  CNVs  is  to  systematically  as-
sess  the  association  between  such  variants  and  the 
disease.  Although  it  is  unlikely  that  all  CNVs  in  the  hu-
man  genome  are  associated  with  diseases,  evidence  of 
the  association  of  CNVs  and  a  wide  spectrum  of  human 
diseases  has  rapidly  accumulated.  Table  1  summarizes 
the  CNVs  that  have  been  reported  to  be  associated  with 
diseases.  CNVs  can  affect  disease  susceptibility  or  in-
dividual  differences  in  responses  to  drugs  through  alter-
ation  of  gene  expression.  Stranger et al.'s  and  Heiden-
blad et al's  reports  coherently  showed  positive  correla-
tions  between  DNA  copy  number  dosage  and  gene  ex-
pression  level  (Stranger  et al.,  2007;  Heidenblad  et al., 
2005).  If  a  CNV  region  contains  transcriptional  regulatory 
elements  rather  than  protein  coding  genes,  it  still  can 
affect  gene  expression  levels  by  changing  transcriptional 
regulation  or  heterochromatin  spread  (Reymond  et al., 
2007).

Conclusion

The  genomic  fraction  that  is  occupied  by  CNVs  is  now 
estimated  to  be  about  600  Mb,  already  exceeding  that 
of  single  base-level  variants.  It  is  likely  that  the  number 
of  CNVs  and  the  genomic  fraction  that  is  affected  by 
structural  variants  will  continue  to  expand,  and  many  of 
them  will  be  used  for  more  practical  purposes,  including 
disease  association  or  population  studies.  However,  it 
should  be  remembered  that  the  current  CNV  entries  are 
plagued  by  substantial  amounts  of  false-positive  and 
false-negative  results.  Only  a  small  portion  of  them  have 
been  validated  by  independent  methods.  To  overcome 
this,  it  is  necessary  to  improve  scanning  platforms,  in-
cluding  optimizing  experimental  conditions  and  develop-
ing  more  reliable  CNV  calling  algorithms.  In  the  mean-
time,  it  is  required  for  individual  researchers  to  know  the 
characteristics  of  the  available  platforms  and  analytical 
techniques  to  use  them  or  to  interpret  the  published  re-
