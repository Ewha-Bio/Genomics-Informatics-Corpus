Abstract 
Visualization  of 
is  an 
important  method  to  analyze  the  evolutionary  and 
functional  meanings  of  genes.  With  a  database 
containing  model  genomes  of  Homo  sapiens,  Mus 
muculus, and Rattus norvegicus, we constructed a web(cid:173)
based comparative analysis tool, BioCovi, to visualize the 
homology information of mammalian sequences on a very 
large scale. The user interface has several features: 
it 
marks  regions  whose  identity  is  greater  than  that 
specified, it shows or hides gaps from the result of global 
sequence alignment, and it inverts the graph when total 
identity is higher than the threshold specified.

Summary 
Since  1995,  over 250 genomes  have been  completely 
sequenced (Bernal  eta/., 2001; Shendure eta/., 2004). 
Although  the  number  of  known  genome  sequences 
increased  rapidly,  we  still  need  to  mine  information 
about gene function,  gene regulation,  and the origin of 
genes.  To extract  information  in  genomes,  we  need  a 
comparative  analysis  for  large  scale  genomes.  In  the 
past,  the comparative analysis of eukaryotic genomes, 
such  as  mouse  and  human,  resulted  in  discovering 
novel  conserved  gene  regions,  novel  non-coding 
regions,  and  gene  regulatory  sequences  (Pennacchio 
and Rubin, 2001; Rubin eta/., 2000). In the comparative 
analysis 
genomes, 
visualization  is helpful  as the sequences are very long 
and complicated in terms of their organization.

Currently,  there  are  several  popular  visualization 
tools  for  sequence  alignments.  Dotplot  (Sonnhammer 
and  Durbin,  1995) can  display sequence  homology  in 
two  genomes,  repeat  sequences,  and  palindromes  in 
the genomes in  UNIX X server environment. There are 
also several visualization tools using ASCII  characters. 
APOLLO (Lewis eta/., 2002) visualizes gene annotation 
using  GFF  (General  Feature  Format)  file.  PipMaker 
(Schwartz et at.,  2000) visualizes conserved regions in 
two genomes.  However,  it  is  difficult for these tools to 
represent  information  of  conserved  coding-region  and 
non-coding  region  such  as  promoters  in  genomes. 
Consequently tools such as Mulan (Ovcharenko  eta/., 
2005) and VISTA (Frazer et at.,  2004) were developed. 
These tools implemented the visualization of annotated 
information such as gene position,  gene structure,  and 
repeat region on a whole genomic comparative analysis 
perspective.

It  efficiently  visualizes 

Our program visualizes the annotation of a genome 
and sequence homology among genomes using BLAT 
(Kent, 2002), AVID (Bray eta/., 2003), and VISTA, with 
the 
some  added 
information  obtained 
from  comparative  genomic 
analyses. The main features added are:  1) gap option: 
gaps  can  be  shown  or  hidden.  In  global  sequence 
alignments, gaps mean either an insertion or a deletion. 
This option makes the visualization clearer by identifying 
conserved 
the  query 
sequences;  and  2)  inverting  graphs:  when  the  mutual 
alignment  identity  of  sequences  is  high,  it  is  more 
effective to see where the sequences are different as in 
the case where SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) 
locations are important. Thus we invert a graph when the 
total identity is higher than a certain threshold specified, 
as  people  usually  use  the  upper  part  in  a  sequence 
graph. By integrating AVID, BLAT, and VISTA programs 
and  making  a  graphical  visualization,  we  can  obtain 
information  from  coding  regions  very  easily  and  can 
achieve  a  more  elaborate  comparative  genomics 
analysis.

Comparing genomes using BioCovi: For the comparison 
of up to  10 genomes,  one can  load  FASTA sequence 
format  files.  The  BioCovi  runs  the  above  mentioned 
algorithms internally and shows the text based results in 
sequence pictures on the web server. The web server is

a part  of  Biolnfra (http://bioinfra.  org or http://bioinfra.ngic.re. 
kr),  a very large bioinformatics  infrastructure containing 
various steps of genome analysis. The major advantage 
of BioCovi is that it can reveal exon and intron information 
using known reference sequence. 

Results 
We  carried  out  a  comparative  analysis  on  the  NFkB 
gene in human and mouse genomes. The gene resides 
in  the chromosome four at the  103,779,572 location  in 
human and in the chromosome three at the 136,131 ,339 
location in mouse. The following graphs Fig.  1 are taken 
from the BioCovi. The length of the human NFkB gene is 
116,000 base pairs and that of the mouse NFkB gene is 

107,000 base pairs. 

The top-most line, the annotation field,  in the graphs 
a,  b,  and  c  shows  exons,  introns,  and  UTRs.  Exons, 
introns and UTRs are blue, cyan, and yellow. Red bars of 
the  second  line,  are  conserved  region.  The  third  and 
fourth  lines,  alignment  fields,  represent  the  result  of 
global alignment. Bar graphs in the lower part of graphs 
a,  b and c are identity fields.  The identity is the  ratio of 
matched nucleotides in a window, which has the point at 
the center. 

Users can see the global alignment results intuitively 
with BioCovi.  It can  be recognized easily that UTR and 
exons are conserved in the two. On the other hand, there 
are  many  gaps  in  the  intron  regions.  The  result  of 
comparative analysis with  BioCovi  is very intuitive and
