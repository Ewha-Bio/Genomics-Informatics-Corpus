More effective production of human insulin is important, because insulin is the main medication that is used to treat multiple 
types of diabetes and because many people are suffering from diabetes. The current system of insulin production is based on 
recombinant DNA technology, and the expression vector is composed of a preproinsulin sequence that is a fused form of an 
artificial leader peptide and the native proinsulin. It has been reported that the sequence of the leader peptide affects the 
production of insulin. To analyze how the leader peptide affects the maturation of insulin structurally, we adapted several in 
silico  simulations  using  13  artificial  proinsulin  sequences.  Three-dimensional  structures  of  models  were  predicted  and 
compared. Although their sequences had few differences, the predicted structures were somewhat different. The structures 
were refined by molecular dynamics simulation, and the energy of each model was estimated. Then, protein-protein docking 
between the models and trypsin was carried out to compare how efficiently the protease could access the cleavage sites of 
the proinsulin models. The results showed some concordance with experimental results that have been reported; so, we 
expect our analysis will be used to predict the optimized sequence of artificial proinsulin for more effective production.

Introduction

Human insulin, produced by beta-cells of the pancreatic 
islets, plays a critical role in the regulation of the metabolism 
of glucose [1]. Dysfunction of the synthesis or release of 
insulin may lead to diabetes mellitus [2]. Millions of people 
suffer from diabetes mellitus worldwide [3], and the most 
common medication to treat diabetes is insulin; so, a large 
number of studies on insulin have been done [4]. Insulin is 
first produced as an inactive protein, called preproinsulin. 
Preproinsulin, including a signal peptide, is a single, long 
protein. The chain evolves into proinsulin by cutting out the 
signal  peptide. Then, proinsulin needs to be  cleaved into 
insulin (an A chain and B chain) by removing the C-peptide 
linking the two chains [5]. 

Nowadays,  recombinant  DNA  techniques  enable  us  to 

produce  insulin  through  biochemical  processes  using 
Escherichia coli [6]. However, the production of proinsulin by 
E. coli strains has to several drawbacks, such as low exp-
ression, difficulty in solubilizing the inclusion body, short 
half-life  in  the  host  cell,  high  proteolysis,  and  inefficient 
translation of the underlying coding sequences [7]. A new 
fusion  protein  system,  which  fuses  an  artificial  leader 
peptide to the N-terminus of proinsulin, has been invented 
as  a  solution  to  these  problems  [8].  The  specificity  of 
cleavage and refolding rates are known to be dependent on 
the  sequences  of  leader  peptides,  and  different  kinds  of 
sequences have been proposed [6, 7, 9-11]. Thus, how the 
sequence of the artificial leader peptide affects the produc-
tion of proinsulin and its modification into mature insulin 
needs to be investigated. 

In  this  work,  we  used  several  kinds  of  computational 
approaches  to  find  a  better  leader  peptide.  First,  we

predicted the three-dimensional structures of fused proin-
sulins while changing the leader peptides. Although the 3D 
structure of proinsulin was determined recently [12] and 
although that of active insulin was determined long ago [13], 
the  structure  of  fused  proinsulin  should  be  analyzed  by 
prediction.  Afterwards,  the  stabilities  of  the  predicted 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

structures  were  calculated  by  molecular  dynamics  (MD) 
simulation. MD is a method that simulates the movements 
of atoms and calculates their potential energies. Finally, the 
interaction of proinsulins with protease was evaluated by 
protein-protein  docking.  By  comparing  these  structural 
analyses  and  experiments,  we  demonstrate  that  these 
structural analyses may contribute to determining whether a 
leader peptide results in efficient production of insulin.

In previous work (patent WO 2004/044206 A1), a for-
mula  for  constructing  a  leader  peptide  was  proposed  as 
follows:  Met-Thr-Met-Ile-Thr⋯Lys(Arg).  We  selected  13 
models, as shown in Table 1. Out of these 13 models, 5 have 
been  used to  generate  experimental results  in  a previous 
work [7], and 7 are being introduced in this work.

Protein structure prediction 

The full sequence (leader peptide of the model plus the 
native  sequence  of  proinsulin)  of  each  fused  protein  was 
used as an input for the structure prediction. Among various 
methods  of  3D  protein  structure  prediction,  we  used 
I-TASSER (Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement) [14], 
which  ranked  as  first  in  performance  in  recent  commu-
nity-based competitions [15, 16].

MD simulation

The predicted structures were located in a cubic box of 
water; then, 3-ns MD simulations were carried out using 
GROMACS, ver. 5.1.2 [17]. Amber99sb was chosen as the 
force  field  [18].  Energies  of  the  models  were  minimized 
using the steepest descent algorithm for 3 ns. The step size 
was 0.002 ps. The properties and stabilities of the models 
were evaluated based on the potential energy, total energy, 
and root-mean-square deviation of the atomic positions. 

Protein-protein docking

Protein-protein docking between trypsin (PDB ID: 2PTN) 

and  recombinant  proinsulins  was  performed  using  the 
InterEvDock server [19]. The InterEvDock server provides 
three kinds of scores: InterEvDock, FRODOCK [20], and 
SOAP_PP [21]. We chose the SOAP_PP score to evaluate the 
binding  affinities,  and  docked  poses  were  used  to  check 
whether two proteins were bound at the right position. 

Results and Discussion

We predicted the 3D structures of 13 artificial models of 
proinsulin  using  I-TASSER  (Fig.  1).  As  shown  in  Fig.  1, 
different  leader  peptides  affected  the  overall  structure  of 
proinsulin. Especially, although the sequences of models 1

and 2 had only a 1-residue difference, the predicted positions 
of the leader peptides were quite different. 

To  refine  the  predicted  structures,  we  observed  the 
changes in structures by MD simulation at 3 ns to minimize 
energy. The structures after the MD simulation were supe-
rimposed onto the original structures by I-TASSER (Fig. 2). 
All potential energies of models were kept relatively stable 
(Fig. 3). The predicted structures were little refined; thus, 
they were naturally favorable. The total energy and potential 
energy of models 3 and 8 were the lowest. Among the models 
tested  before  (Table  1),  no  correlation  between  refolding 
yields and energies was observed. 

Preproinsulin should be refolded and cleaved to become 
mature insulin. A previous work showed that trypsin could 
be used as an efficient protease in the maturation of insulin 
[7]. To investigate how the leader peptide affects the binding 
mode between proinsulin and trypsin, in silico docking was 

carried out by InterEVDock [19]. 

Interestingly, in the docked structure (Fig. 4), the active 
sites (histidine 57, aspartate 102, and serine 195) of trypsin 
were located near lysine 64 and arginine 65 of proinsulin, 
which  is  the  exact  position  where  the  first  cleavage  of 
proinsulin occurs to release chain A. Binding affinities were 
also predicted by InterEVDock (Table 2). Among all docked 
structures,  models  1  and  2  were  predicted  to  have  the 
strongest binding affinities. 

Because  multiple  steps  of  cleavage  are  needed  for 
maturation,  we  performed  additional  protein  docking  of 
trypsin to model structures whose C-terminal chain after 
residue 64 (A chain) was cleaved out. As a result of this step, 
the preferable position for the active sites of trypsin were 
located near arginine 31 and arginine 32, which are known to 
form a cleavage site between the B and C chains. The binding 
affinities  of  the  models  were  predicted  to  be  strong  (in 
descending order): model 2, 3, and 1. The two docking steps 
for artificial proinsulin models into trypsin revealed leader 
peptides that did not affect the order of cleavage sites, and 
models 1 and 2 are likely to be best accessed by trypsin in 
producing  mature  insulin.  This  coincides  with  previously 
tested refolding yields [7]. 

In summary, using 13 artificial models of leader peptides 
of  proinsulin,  we  predicted  the  structures  of  fused  pro-
insulins, the structures were refined by MD simulation, and 
protein-protein  docking  revealed  binding  modes  between 
the  artificial  models  and  trypsin.  The  energies  of  the 
predicted  structures  of  the  models  were  not  related  to 
refolding  yields,  but  the  docking  energies  between  the 
protease and the models showed some relation. We expect 
these analyses to provide basic information in a structural 
context for more effective production of insulin.
