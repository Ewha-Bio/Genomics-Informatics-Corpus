Abstract

Methylation  of  cytosine  is  a  post-synthesis  modification 
that  does  not  affect  the  primary  DNA  sequence  but 
greatly  influences  gene  expression  level  and  phenotypes 
of  an  organism.  As  high-throughput  sequencing  of  bi-
sulfite-treated  DNA  is  the  most  efficient  method  to  iden-
tify  methylated  sites,  several  tools  to  map  sequencing 
reads  on  a  reference  are  available.  But  tools  to  visualize 
and  to  interpret  the  methylation  level  of  methylation 
sites  are  currently  insufficient.  Herein,  we  present  a  nov-
el  tool  to  visualize  the  methylation  level  of  CpG  sites. 

Availability:  MethylDraw  is  available  at  http://sourceforge. 
net/p/methyldraw.

Introduction

Epigenetics  is  a  growing  research  field  which  aims  to  in-
vestigate  non-genetic  factors  that  alter  the  expression 
level  of  an  organism's  genes  and  characterize  pheno-
types  without  changing  DNA  sequence  (Bird,  2007). 
DNA  methylation  is  one  of  the  most  studied  epigenetic 
modifications  and  usually  occurs  in  the  CG-rich  regions. 
Hypermethylation  of  cytosine  residues  at  CpG  dinucleo-
tides  in  the  promoter  regions  is  often  observed  at  DNA 
repair  genes,  metastasis  inhibitor  genes  and  tumor  sup-
pressor  genes  in  cancer  (Esteller et al.,  2001).  By  identi-
fying  aberrant  methylation  hot-spots  in  cancer  cells,  we 
can  target  these  genes  for  therapeutic  intervention  and 
develop  DNA  methylation  biomarkers  for  early  detection, 
diagnosis,  prognosis,  and  monitoring  response  to  the-
rapy. 
    High-throughput  bisulfite  sequencing  is  the  current

gold  standard  in  analysis  of  DNA  methylation  patterns  in 
a  genome  (Cokus et al.,  2008).  Bisulfite  treatment  con-
verts  unmethylated  forms  of  cytosine  to  uracil  and  re-
sequencing  identifies  the  methylated  sites  by  comparing 
the  bases  of  sequencing  reads  to  those  of  a  reference 
sequence  after  sequencing  reads  are  mapped  to  the  ref-
erence  sequence  by  mapping  programs 
including 
BSMAP  (Xi  and  Li,  2009)  and  RMAP  (Smith et al.,  2009). 
Several  visualization  programs  including  Methtool  (Gru-
nau et al.,  2000)  and  BiQAnalyzer  (Bock et al.,  2005)  are 
available  to  show  the  methylation  level  of  CpG  sites,  but 
they  do  not  provide  a  visualization  interface  to  compare 
the  methylation  level  of  multiple  genes  and  multiple  con-
ditions  at 
time.  Herein,  we  present 
MethylDraw  which  is  a  tool  to  draw  images  visualizing 
the  methylation  level  of  CpG  sites  for  several  samples 
treated  in  different  conditions.

Features  and  Results

MethylDraw  is  composed  of  a  set  of  PERL  script  pro-
grams  and  runs  in  a  command  line  environment.  It  re-
quires  two  different  types  of  input  files.  The  first  type 
contains  only  CpG  positions  of  genes  in  a  reference  ge-
nome.  The  second  type  contains  the  total  number  of  se-
quencing  reads  and  the  number  of  methylated  reads  at 
each  position  for  each  condition,  which  is  a  generalized 
format  to  accommodate  diverse  outputs  of  mapping 
programs.  It  reads  multiple  input  files  for  different  con-
ditions  to  support  a  genome  association  study  which  is 
widely  used  in  polymorphism  studies  (Hong et al.,  2010), 
then  creates  HTML  outputs  which  are  easily  accessible 
using  a  web  browser.
    The  HTML  files  generated  by  MethylDraw  consist  of 
four  different  categories:  average  view,  gene  view,  con-
dition  view  and  full  view  (Fig.  1).  The  average  view 
shows  an  average  methylation  level  per  gene  per  con-
dition  in  a  single  page.  The  gene  view  and  the  condition 
view  show  the  methylation  level  of  CpG  sites  for  only  a 
selected  gene  and  a  selected  condition,  respectively. 
And  the  full  view  shows  the  methylation  level  of  CpG 
sites  for  all  genes  and  conditions  in  a  single  page.  Colo-
ring  of  each  cell  on  an  image,  which  corresponds  to  a 
CpG  site,  is  determined  by  the  degree  of  two  proper-
ties,  coverage  and  methylation  level,  which  are  descri-
bed  by  two  bars  on  the  left  top  parts  of  images  in  the 
HTML  files.  The  color  intensity  represents  the  level  of 
coverage  and  the  height  of  the  dark  represents  the  de-

Discussion

We  have  developed  a  tool  to  visualize  the  methylation 
level  estimated  from  high-throughput  bisulfite  sequenc-
ing  results.  MethylDraw  supports  a  sequencing  analysis 
pipeline  using  diverse  tools  by  taking  generalized  input 
files,  running  on  a  command  line  environment  and  pro-
ducing  HTML  files  and  image  files.  In  the  future,  it  will 
have  a  web  interface  to  accept  user  inputs  through  a 
web  browser.
