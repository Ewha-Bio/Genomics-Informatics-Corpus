Comparison of Erythrocyte Traits Among European, Japanese 
and  Korean

quantitative  traits.  We  analyzed  GWA  scanning  data  of 
erythrocyte  traits  for  8,842  Korean  individuals  (Fig.  1). 
To  date,  samples  of  several  studies  associated  with  er-
ythrocyte  traits  are  European  origin,  Japanese,  and 
Chinese,  and  it  remains  unclear  whether  the  same  loci 
affect  erythrocyte  traits  in  Korean.  Hence  we  compared 
genetic  variations  that  affected  erythrocyte  traits  among 
European,  Japanese  and  Korean  (Fig.  2).

Abstract

Erythrocyte  traits  are  heritable  and  indirect  indicators  of 
blood  diseases  caused  by  erythrocyte,  but  their  genetic 
factors  are  largely  unknown.  So  we  performed  ge-
nome-wide  association  study  in  8,842  Korean  individuals 
to  identify  genetic  factors  influencing  erythrocyte  traits. 
We  identified  40  associations  for  three  erythrocyte  traits 
at  genome-wide  significance  levels  (p＜1×10
compared  these  associated  loci  with  those  reported  in 
genome-wide  association  studies  of  European  and 
Japanese.  Our  findings  include  previously  identified  loci 
(HBS1L-MYB,  TMPRSS6,  USP49  and  CCND3)  in  other 
studies  and  novel  associations  (MRDS1/OFCC1,  CSDE1, 
NRAS  and  8  other  loci).  For  example,  SNP  rs4895440  of 
HBS1L-MYB  intergenic  region  on  chromosome  6q23.3  is 
one  of  the  most  associations  influencing  erythrocyte 
traits  (p=8.33×10

Introduction

Erythrocytes  (Red  blood  cells)  such  important  cells  as  a 
function  of  delivering  Oxygen  (O2)  to  the  body  tissues 
are  the  most  common  type  of  blood  cell.  The  count  and 
volume  of  the  erythrocytes  in  blood  are  high  heritable 
and  it  is  different  between  individuals.  Erythrocyte  traits 
include  the  hemoglobin  (Hb),  hematocrit  (Hct),  red  blood 
cell  (RBC)  which  are  commonly  used  indicators  in  the 
clinic.  Blood  diseases  caused  by  erythrocyte  are  ane-
mias,  hemolysis,  polycythemias.  These  are  widely  asso-
ciated  with  other  diseases  such  as  cardiovascular  dis-
eases,  hypertension,  but  genetic  factors  of  erythrocyte 
traits  are  poorly  proved.
    Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWAS)  identify  a 
number  of  loci  associated  with  common  diseases  with

In  the  current  study,  we  performed  GWAS  for  the  three 
erythrocyte  traits  of  8,842  samples  that  are  divided  as 
4,183  men  and  4,659  women.  Hb,  Hct  and  RBC  of  er-
ythrocyte  traits  are  commonly  used  in  the  diagnosis  of 
anemia.  Single  marker  association  p-values  were  esti-
mated  from  linear  regression  after  adjusting  age,  sex 
and  bmi,  and  then  40  loci  were  identified  as  strongly 
associated  with  erythrocyte  traits  having  p  values  lower 
than  1.00×10
ped  to  6  Hb,  4  Hct  and  6  RBC  genes.  We  confirmed 
the  previously  reported  associations  of  erythrocyte  traits 
with  the  following  four  loci-:  HBS1L-MYB,  TMPRSS6, 
USP49  and  CCND3  (Table  2,  Fig.  3).
    In  the  HBS1L-MYB  intergenic  region  on  chromosome 
6q23,  several  SNPs  showed  genome-wide  significant 
associations  with  Hct  and  RBC.  While  the  role  of 
HBS1L  is  unknown,  MYB  has  been  associated  with  pro-
liferation,  survival,  and  differentiation  of  hematopoietic 
progenitor  cells.  In  addition  the  intergenic  region  of  the 
HBS1L  gene  and  the  MYB  gene  has  been  identified  to 
be  a  quantitative  trait  locus  controlling  fetal  hemoglobin 
level,  and  this  region  influences  erythrocyte,  platelet, 
and  monocyte  counts  as  well  as  erythrocyte  volume  and 
hemoglobin  content.  Like  our  findings,  SNP  rs4895441 
is  strongly  associated  with  Hct  and  RBC  (p=9.7×10
p=2.2×10
SNPs  of  HBS1L-MYB  intergenic  region  were  located  in 
complete  LD  block  with  rs4895441  (D’=1.000,  R2=0.999). 
In  the  RBC,  six  SNPs  of  HBS1L-MYB  intergenic  region 
−27),  rs4895440 
are  as  follows:rs11759553  (p=8.33×10
−27),  rs9402686 
(p=8.33×10
−26)  and  rs-
(p=8.44×10
−26).  Rs9402686,  rs4895441  and 
9376092  (p=1.46×10
rs9376092  were  identified  to  associate  with  erythrocytes 
in  previous  studies  of  Europe,  Japan  and  China.
    TMPRSS6  encodes  a  type  II  transmembrane  serine 
protease  produced  by  the  liver  that  regulates  the  ex-
pression  of  hepcidin  (Finberg et al.,  2008),  which  blocks 
iron  absorption.  And  it  is  known  that  mutation  in 
TMPRSS6  gene  causes  iron-refractory  iron  deficiency 
anemia  (IRIDA)  from  other  study.  SNP  rs5756505  in 
TMPRSS6  gene  was  associated  with  Hb  (p=4.57×10
and  in  complete  LD  with  rs5756504  that  was  associated 
with  Hb  in  GWAS  of  Japanese  population  (R2=0.988) 
(Table  1).
    CCND3  gene  has  roles  in  hematopoiesis.  For  ex-
  mice  showed  lethality  due  to  heart

abnormalities  combined  with  severe  anemia  in  other

Methods

Study  samples  and  genotype  data

The  samples  and  genotype  data  used  in  this  study  have 
been  described  by  Cho et al.  (2009).  Briefly,  through  the 
Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project  that  was  ini-
tiated  in  2007  10,038  participants  were  recruited  from 
Ansan  (n=5,020)  and  Ansung  (n=5,018)  population-based 
cohorts  aged  40  to  69.  Among  them  10,004  were  geno-
typed  using  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP 
array  5.0.  After  removing  samples  and  markers  that 
failed  quality  control  test,  a  total  of  352,228  markers  in 
8,842  individuals  were  used  (Cho  et al.,  2009).

SNP  imputation

SNP  imputation  has  been  described  by  Lee  and  Kim 
(2009).  Briefly,  using  PLINK  (Purcell  et al.,  2007)  the 
KARE  genotypes  were  supplemented  by  imputing  SNP 
genotypes  based  on  those  of  the  unrelated  Chinese  in 
Beijing  (CHB)  and  Japanese  in  Tokyo  (JPT)  panel  of 
HapMap  Phase  II.

Association  analyses

Erythrocyte  traits  were  tested  for  association  by  linear 
regression  analysis  with  an  additive  model  after  adjust-
ment  for  age,  sex  and  bmi  as  covariates  using  PLINK. 
The  genome-wide  level  of  significance  threshold  was  set

ciated  with  mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV)  of  eryth-
rocyte  traits  in  previous  study.
    USP49  gene  is  located  so  close  to  the  CCND3  gene. 
Two  SNPs  of  USP49  found  associated  with  RBC  in  our 
study  were  in  high  LD  with  SNP  rs3218097  of  CCND3 
reported  in  Japanese  GWAS  (rs9381097  D’=0.952  R2= 
0.893,  rs6899876  D’=0.952  R2=0.893).  SNP  rs3806113 
of  MED20  gene  was  also  in  high  LD  with  SNP  3218097 
(D’=0.972,  R2=0.851)  (Table  1,  2).
    We  found  several  loci  associated  with  erythrocyte 
traits  that  have  not  been  reported  previously  as  follows: 
MRDS1/OFCC1,  NRAS,  CSDE1,  GJA5/NBPF1,  MED20, 
PRICKLE4,  DQ592954,  and  AK056031  (Table  1).  Most  of 
these  loci  were  located  on  chromosome  6.  For  example, 
newly  found  genes  such  as  MED  20,  PRICKLE4  and 
DQ592954  as  well  as  previously  reported  USP49  and 
CCND3  are  located  on  chromosome  6p21.1.  While  their 
roles  in  erythrocyte  traits  are  largely  unknown,  we  pre-
sume  that  these  loci  affect  RBC.

In  the  current  study,  we  identified  40  associations  for

and  their  neighboring  genes  were  known  to  be  involved 
with  iron  homeostasis,  erythropoiesis,  and  globin  syn-
thesis.  Measurement  of  RBC,  Hb  and  Hct,  which  are 
mainly  quantitative  measures  of  hemoglobin  per  eryth-
rocytes,  are  parameters  for  the  detection  of  blood  dis-

found  in  the  HBS1L-MYB  locus  on  chromosome  6q23 
(Table  1).  Although  its  association  with  Hct  and  RBC 
only  is  listed  in  Table  1,  its  SNPs  also  have  associations 
with  Hb  (rs11759553  p=8.07×10

CCND3  encodes  cyclin  D3,  which  has  been  known  to 
be  critical  for  the  expansion  of  hematopoietic  stem  cells, 
as  mice  lacking  D-cyclins  develop  severe  anemia  in  ex-
periment7.  Hence  it  is  likely  that  genetic  factors  in  cy-
clin-related  genes  influence  erythrocyte  traits.  Compar-
isons  of  erythrocyte  traits  among  European,  Japanese 
and  Korean,  confirm  that  HBS1L-MYB  and  TMPRSS6 
loci  are  strongly  associated  with  erythrocyte  traits  both 
in  European  and  Asian.  On  the  other  hand,  CCND3  and 
USP49  genes  influencing  RBC  are  identified  in  only 
Asian.  Besides,  many  other  genes  belonged  exclusively 
to  each  population  (Fig.  2).
    The  novel  loci  reported  in  the  current  study  need  fur-
ther  study  to  confirm  whether  they  have  roles  in  bio-
logical  processes  associated  erythrocytes.
