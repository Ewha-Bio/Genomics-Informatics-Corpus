ogy  Information  has  been  providing  an  FTP  server  and 
analysis  services  for  major  bio-databases.  We  have  de-
veloped  BioStore  as  a  repository  system  by  implement-
ing  a  few  programs  to  register  user  data,  including  pub-
lic  bio-data  at  CCBB.  Researchers  can  easily  register 
their  own  data  with  BioStore  through  the  system  to 
share  them  with  others.

Abstract

Features  and  Results

Although  abundant  biology  data  have  been  accumulated 
in  public  biology  databases,  such  as  GenBank  and  PIR, 
few  easy-interface  services  are  provided  for  users  to  ac-
cess  or  update  them.  We  have  developed  a  system, 
named  BioStore,  that  is  composed  of  several  programs 
to  aid  users  to  not  only  access  public  data  but  also 
share  their  own  data  easily.  The  service  can  be  used  for 
maintaining  a  local  database  as  a  repository  of  raw  data 
files  of  several  public  databases  and  distributing  the  da-
ta  files  to  other  users.  Currently,  BioStore  manipulates 
major  bio-databases  and  will  expand  to  include  more 
databases  and  more  useful  interfaces.

Availability:  This  system  is  available  from  http://www. 
ccbb.re.kr/biostore

BioStore  has  the  following  features:
　
    -  bio-database  mirroring
    -  directory  browsing
    -  data  download 
    -  quick  search
    -  xml  viewer
    -  user  data  registering
　
    BioStore  is  composed  of  2  parts  (Fig.  1),  a  data  list-
ing  part  and  a  data  registering  part.  The  data  listing  part 
lists  entry  names  that  are  registered  with  BioStore  of  the 
CCBB  server.  The  main  web  page  of  BioStore  has  a 
user-friendly  web  interface  and  similar  features  to  FTP 
programs  (Fig.  2A).  The  left  frame  shows  data  directo-

Introduction

Biology  data,  especially  DNA  and  protein  sequence  da-
ta,  are  very  rapidly  increasing.  Most  data  have  been 
submitted  to  major  bioinformatics  databases,  such  as 
GenBank  (Benson  et al.,  1994),  PIR  (McGarvey  et al., 
2000),  and  PDB  (Berman,  2000),  which  are  distributed 
via  FTP  services  to  a  lot  of  bioinformatics  sites  and 
users.  As  more  and  more  bio-databases  (Jeon  et al., 
2005;  Kim  et al.,  2008)  are  constructed  and  a  large 
amount  of  data  files  is  kept  in  each  database,  most  bi-
ology  researchers  have  difficulty  in  searching  for  in-
formation  and  in  sharing  their  own  data  with  others.

ries  on  a  tree  structure,  and  the  right  frame  shows  the 
description  and  contents  of  a  selected  directory.  When 
a  user  logs  into  the  CCBB  system  and  a  directory  has 
been  registered  by  the  user,  it  is  colored  deep  blue. 
Because  researchers  have  difficulty  in  finding  data  files 
from  the  FTP  sites  of  major  bio-databases  due  to  their 
complex  structures,  BioStore  provides  a  quick  search 
tool  with  a  file  name  search  from  BioStore  (Fig.  2B). 
    The  data  registering  part  (Fig.  2C)  stores  the  user  data 
files  to  the  FTP  server  in  CCBB  and  registers  the  file 
names  to  the  MySQL  database.  When  a  login  user  re-
quests  data  registration,  BioStore  transmits  a  registra-
tion  client  program  to  the  user  PC,  which  launches 
automatically.  The  process  is  carried  out  by  java  web 
start  technology.  After  the  program  verifies  the  user  in-
formation,  it  connects  to  the  data  registration  server  of 
BioStore  and  provides  upload  and  download  interfaces. 
When  the  user  uploads  data  files  to  the  server,  the  data 
registration  server  keeps  the  files  in  the  CCBB  FTP 
server  and  registers  data  file  names  to  the  MySQL 
database.  Then  the  files  can  be  distributed  by  the  data 
listing  server.

Discussion

Although  most  bio-databases  have  their  own  FTP  serv-
ices  to  distribute  data  files,  researchers  face  difficulties 
in  finding  appropriate  data  files  due  to  huge  amounts  of 
data  in  each  bio-database.  BioStore  has  been  devel-
oped  to  aid  researchers  to  not  only  access  the  data 
files  of  public  bio-databases  but  also  share  their  own 
databases  easily.  With  user-friendly  interfaces,  the  sys-
tem  provides  useful  tools,  including  a  search  tool,  an 
XML  viewer,  and  a  data  registration  feature.
    The  system  currently  provides  major  public  bio-data-
bases,  including  GenBank  and  PDB,  and  will  integrate 
more  bio-databases,  including  user  databases,  which 
are  produced  by  many  researchers. 
    With  the  increase  of  data  files,  the  structure  of  direc-
tories  will  be  more  complicated,  and  better  interfaces 
and  features  will  be  developed  through  further  develop-
ment.
