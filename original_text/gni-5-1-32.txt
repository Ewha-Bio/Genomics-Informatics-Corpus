Abstract 
Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is an enzymatic 
ribonucleoprotein that prolongs the replicative life span of 
cells by maintaining protective structures at the ends of 
eukaryotic  chromosomes. Telomerase  activity is highly 
up-regulated  in  85-90%  of  human  cancers,  and  is 
predominately regulated by hTERT expression. In contrast, 
most nonnal  somatic tissues  in  humans express low or 
undetectable levels oftelomerase activity. This expression 
profile identifies TERT as a potential anticancer target.  By 
using an  RNA mapping strategy based on a trans-splicing 
ribozyme library, we identified the regions of mouse TERT 
(mTERT)  RNA that were  accessible to  ribozymes.  We 
found  that  particularly  accessible  sites  were  present 
dovvnstream  of the  AUG  start  codon.  This  mTERT(cid:173)
specific ribozyme will be useful for validation of the RNA 
replacement as cancer gene therapy approach in mouse 
model vvith  syngeneic tumors.

A comparison with nonnal somatic tissues has shOWl that 
telomerase activity is up-regulated in the vast majority of 
human  tumors.  Particularly,  expression  of the  catalytic 
subunit oftelomerase, TERT, in  cultured human primary 
cells  reconstitutes  telomerase  activity  and  facilitates 
immortal cell growth  (Bodnar eta/., 1998). Furthennore, 
TERT-driven  cell proliferation  results in  the activation of 
the  c-myc  oncogene  (Wang  et  a/.,  2000),  and  TERT(cid:173)
activated telomerase can  cooperate vvith other oncogenes 
totransfonn primary human cultured cells into neoplastic 
cells (Hahn eta/., 1999). The effects observed in  cultured 
cells  suggested  that  telomerase  upregulation,  vvhich 
occurs in >90% of all human tumors (reviewed in Shay and 
Sacchetti, 1997), may actively contribute to tumor growth

(reviewed  in  Weitzman  and  Yaniv,  1999).  Therefore, 
telomerase  activity  inhibition  in  tumor  cells  has  been 
proposed as a potential  approach for cancer therapy. 

Recently,  we  described  a new approach  to  human 
cancer  gene  therapy  that  relies  on  the  Tetrahyrrena 
group  1-based  trans-splicing  ribozyme.  This  ribozyme 
can  specifically  mediate  RNA  replacement  of  human 
TERT  (hTERT)  RNAs  with  new transcripts  that  exert 
cytotoxic effects, or cause up-regulation of suicide gene 
activity  in  the  hTERT  RNA-expressing  cancer  cells. 
These  attributes  enable  the  ribozyme  to  selectively 
impede the growth  oftelomerase-positive human  cancer 
cells in cell cultures, and in xenotransplants in mice (Kwon 
el a/.,  2005). 

A preclinical index vvhich includes therapeutic effects, 
toxicities,  and pharmacokinetics must be detennined to 
evaluate the therapeutic potential of the hTERT-specific 
ribozyme in a clinical setting. An  established animal model 
with  syngeneic tumors would be useful in  evaluating the 
ribozyme  using  standard  immunological  surveillance 
methods (Shi eta/., 2001). To this end, we have developed 
mouse TERT (mTERT)-specific trans-splicing ribozymes 
by utilizing an  RNA mapping  method that  identifies the 
most accessible ribozyme sites. 

Mapping of the  trnns-splicing ribozyme 
There is considerable flexibility in the selection of specific 
sites in target RNA for the trans-splicing ribozyme. This is 
because virtually any uridine (U) residue in  a 5'exon can 
be  targeted  for  splicing  by  altering  the  nucleotide 
composition of the 5' exon binding site on  the ribozyme. 
This region  is called the internal  guide sequence (IGS), 
and it can  be altered to make it complementary to a target 
sequence that is present on the substrate RNA(Sullenger, 
1995; Long eta/., 2003). However, only a limited number 
ofuridines on the target RNA may actually be accessible 
to the  ribozyme  due to the  complex,  but  stable tertiary 
configuration  of the  substrate  RNA  (Lan  eta/.,  2000). 
Therefore,  an  RNA  mapping  strategy was  perfonned  to 
identify regions of the mTERTtransaiptthat were accessible 
to ribozymes. The applied mapping methodology relied on 
RNA  tagging  (Jones  et  a/.,1996)  and  a  trans-splicing 
ribozyme  library  vvhich  has  been  described  in  detail 
elsevvhere(Fig.1)(Lan  eta/., 1998; Laneta/.,2000; Ryu 
el a/.,  2003).

AmpUfication,  cloning and sequencing 

Fig. 1. A schematic representation demonstrating the methodology 
used for the mapping of accessible sites in mTERT RNA in vitro 
using a trans-splicing ribozyme library. 

The construction of theGNS ribozyme library used in 
this study was based on the Tetrahymena group I intron 
and contains a randomized IGS. Ribozymes in the GNS 
library can  bind to the substrate RNA and cleave at any 
accessible U residue, followed by the transference of a 3' 
exon to the end of the 5' target cleavage product. Part of 
the /acZ gene was used as a 3' exon molecular tag in the 
GNS library that could be spliced onto the accessible target 
RNA's. In order to map the mTERT RNA, 10 nM of the GNS 
library  was  incubated  at  3rc for  3  h  under  splicing 
conditions (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM 
MgCb) in the presence of guanosine (200 ~ and 1 00 nM 
of in  vitro  generated  mTERT  RNA  The  trans-splicing 
reaction products were reverse-transcribed at 3rc for 30 
min  in  the  presence  of argininamide  (1 0  mM)  with  a 3' 
tagged primer that was specific for the ribozyme's 3' exon 
/acZ sequence (5'-ATGTGCTGCAAGGCGA TT-3') (Jones 
eta/. 1996). Following reverse transcription, the cDNAs 
were amplified  by PCR for 30 cycles using the same 3' 
primer and a 5' primer that was specific for the 5' end of 
the target  mTERT RNA  (5'-GGGGAATTCGTCTAGAG 
CCACCGTCCA-3'). The amplified trans-splicing products 
were then cloned into the pUC19 vector and several clones 

Sequence analysis of the splicing junction sites revealed 
that several uridines that were present downstream ofthe 
AUG  start  codon  (position  30  nt)  appeared  to  be 
particularly accessible (Fig. 2). The most accessible site 
was located in the uridines at position 67 on the mTERT 
RNA  With  the  exception  of  position  67,  most  of the 
accessible  sites  identified  using  this  mapping  strategy 
were generally present in the stem region  of the RNA's 
secondary structure, as predicted by computer modeling 
(Fig.  2).  The  relative trans-splicing  efficiency at several 
sites on the target RNA in cells and in vitro has previously 
been  shown to  be  closely correlated with the  predicted 
accessibility determined by mapping studies (Ryu eta/., 
2003; Kwon eta/., 2005). Therefore, we cannot anticipate 
ribozyme-accessible  sites  on  the  substrate  solely  by 
using the computer-predicted  RNA structure. 

A specific ribozyme targeting position 67 on the mTERT 
RNA (Rib67) was constructed by in vitro transcription of 
eDNA template. The pT7L-21  plasmid, which encodes a 
slightly shortened version ofthe natural group I intron from 
Tetrahymena, was used to create the template by PCR. 
The  5'  primer  contained  the  T7  promoter  and  the 
ribozyme's IGS, while the 3' primer was specific for the 3' 
exon sequence (Sullenger and Cech, 1994; Jones eta/.,

1996).  The  IGS  on  the  L-21  trans-splicing  ribozyme 
(5'-GGAGGG-3') was exchanged with 5'-GGAGAG-3' in 
Rib67  and  the  specific  ribozyme  (100  nM)  was  then 
incubated with the substrate mTERT RNA (10 nM) under 
splicing  conditions.  RT-PCR  analyses were performed 
using a 3' primer specific for the 3' exoo tag sequence and 
a  5'  primer  specific  for  mTERT  RNA.  The  amplified 
fragment  corresponded  to the expected  size of 165 bp 
using  the  mTERT  RNA  and  Rib67  (data  not  shown). 
Sequence  analyses  of the  amplified  spliced  products 
demoostrated that Rib67 correctly trans-spliced its 3' exon 
tag onto the mTERT target RNA at the predicted reaction 
site (Fig. 3).  From these results we conclude that specific 
ribozyme  targeting  of  predicted  accessible  sites  can 
replace mTERT RNA with a 3' exon tagged at the 3' end 
of the  ribozyme  with  high  reliability  by  using  targeted 
trans-splicing.  This  mTERT-specific  ribozyme  will  be 
useful fcrvalidatioo of RNA replacement as an approach 
to cancer gene therapy in syngeneic mouse models. 

There  are  major  differences  in  the  dynamics  and 
regulation oftelomerase in mouse and human cells. For 
example, the telaneres oflabcratory mice are significantly 
longer  (40-60  kb)  than  those  in  human  (10  kb),  and 
telomerase is widely expressed in  adult mouse tissues 
(Newbold,  1997;  Greeberg  et  a/.,  1998).  The  use  of 
inhibitors such  as trans-cleavage ribozymes,  antisense 
oligonucleotides and siRNA to repress mousetelanerase 
expression may be limited in their use with mouse tumcrs. 
This is due to the lag phase that occurs between the time 
oftelomerase inhibitioo and the time at which the telomeres 
actually become short enough to cause harmful effects 
associated  with  cancer  growth.  However,  the  trans(cid:173)
splicing approach will  overcome the lag phase because 
it  can  reduce  the TERT  level  and  can  simultaneously 
induce cytotoxicity in the TERT-expressing cancer cells. 
Moreover, cancer- or coodition-specific expression of the 
mTERT-targeting ribozyme could improve the specificity 
of tumor cytotoxicity (Song and  Lee,  2006).

Recently,  many  gene  therapy  protocols  based  on 
inhibitory  RNA  or  short  oligonudeotides  have  been 
described. A  key factor that influences the efficiency of 
RNA-mediated cancer suppression is the accessibility of 
the  substrate  RNA  for  binding  of inhibitory  elements. 
Mapping studies, such as those described here, could be 
used  generally  in  a  wide  range  of  applications  for 
optimizing  intracellular  anti-TERT  activity  with  various 
inhibitory RNAs.  Furthermore, the mapping methodology 
that was developed in this study could pctentially be used 
to  identify  the  most  accessible  sites  in  other  unique 
tumor-associated RNAs cr viral RNAs for the development 
of  therapeutic  strategies  for  treating  malignant  or 
infectious diseases.
