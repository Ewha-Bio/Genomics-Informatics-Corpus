In November 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent a warning letter to 23andMe, Inc. and ordered the 
company  to  discontinue  marketing  of  the  23andMe  Personal  Genome  Service  (PGS)  until  it  receives  FDA  marketing 
authorization for the device. The FDA considers the PGS as an unclassified medical device, which requires premarket approval 
or de novo classification. Opponents of the FDA’s action expressed their concerns, saying that the FDA is overcautious and 
paternalistic, which violates consumers’ rights and might stifle the consumer genomics field itself, and insisted that the 
agency  should  not  restrict  direct-to-consumer  (DTC)  genomic  testing  without  empirical  evidence  of  harm.  Proponents 
support the agency’s action as protection of consumers from potentially invalid and almost useless information. This action 
was  also  significant,  since  it  reflected  the  FDA’s  attitude  towards  medical  application  of  next-generation  sequencing 
techniques. In this review, we followed up on the FDA-23andMe incident and evaluated the problems and prospects for DTC 
genetic testing.

Introduction

On November 22, 2013, the US Food and Drug Admini-
stration  (FDA)  sent  a  warning  letter  to  Ann  Wojcicki, 
co-founder  and  CEO  of  23andMe,  Inc.  and  ordered  the 
company  to  “immediately  discontinue  marketing  of  the 
23andMe Saliva Collection Kit and Personal Genome Service 
(PGS)  until  such  time  as  it  receives  FDA  marketing 
authorization for the device” [1]. Since 23andMe is one of 
the largest direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing com-
panies  leading  the  field,  the  FDA’s  action  could  have  big 
implications for the present and future. This FDA letter was 
even called a “bombshell” in one Nature Editorial [2]. Various 
responses  and  speculation  have  followed.  Some  people 
support the FDA’s action as protection of consumers from 
potentially invalid information, while others insist that the 
FDA’s  action  violates  the  rights  of  individuals  to  receive 

information  and  of  ‘commercial  speech’  and  undermines 
democratization of health care and patient empowerment 
[3]. One of those responses is noteworthy: 7 months after 
the FDA’s action, in June 2014, Lee and Lee [4] of the Korea 
Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) submitted 
a report to the Public-Private Joint Regulatory Advancement 
Initiative (PPJRAI), titled “Market Analysis and Strategies 
for  Regulatory  Reform  in  Medical  Industry,”  which 
expressed a stance somehow different from that of the US 
FDA. To facilitate the discussion in our scientific community, 
we examined the development of the 23andMe event and 
reflected on the future of genetic-genome testing, including 
whole-genome sequencing as a medical device.

SH  Yim  and  YJ  Chung.  US  FDA’s  Warning  on  Direct-to-Consumer  Genetic  Testing

testing,  refers  to  genetic  tests  that  are  sold  directly  to 
consumers via the internet, television, or print advertise-
ment without necessarily involving health care providers. Su 
[5] grouped the reasons for using DTC genetic tests into 
three  categories;  identity  (such  as  ancestry,  paternity,  or 
ethnicity)-seeking;  disease  risk-testing  to  complement 
health  care;  and  curiosity-driven  testing.  DTC  genetic 
testing  has  its  pros  and  cons.  It  is  more  accessible  and 
affordable than traditional genetic tests, which usually target 
one specific gene at a time. DTC testing companies and many 
personalized  medicine  advocates  argue  that  knowing  the 
genetic  risks  for  potential  diseases  will  help  people  to 
improve their health and wellness by changing what they can 
and managing what they can not, as claimed in 23andMe’s 
TV commercial [6]. 23andMe, one of the largest DTC genetic 
testing  companies,  also  made  the  same  claims  and  has 
offered  the  PGS  to  ＞475,000  customers  since  2007  [7]. 
23andMe’s PGS genotypes the DNA sample on their custom 
single-nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) chip  and provides 
health reports on 254 diseases and traits, including carrier 
status  and  drug  response,  which,  the  company  claims, 
enables customers to personalize their health care. Addition-
ally, some proponents suggest, as another argument, that 
DTC genetic testing can contribute to the empowerment of 
consumers  by  increasing  knowledge  and  to  subsequent 
democratization of health care [5].

However, many geneticists and physicians have rejected 
the claims. They believe that since DTC genetic testing is not 
reliable  enough  to  be  used  clinically,  it  will  just  end  up 
increasing health care costs unnecessarily [8]. Apart from its 
scientific weaknesses and insufficient clinical utility, there 
are other concerns raised by critics, including psychological 
and financial damage to consumers, especially by unreliable 
test results, health care inequity, and genetic privacy. 

Since we believe that scientific validity is the foremost 
foundation of DTC genetic testing and should presuppose its 
clinical usage, we will focus on it in this review. There are 
quite a few scientific limitations to genome-based health risk 
estimation services in general, not just 23andMe’s PGS, but 
they may not be apparent, even to medical professionals, 
who do not have enough knowledge in genetics and geno-
mics, as well as lay customers. First of all, for monogenic 
disorders,  DTC  genetic  testing  panels  include  a  small 
fraction of known disease-causing mutations or sometimes 
just include mutations present only in specific populations. 
This incompleteness of testing results in misinterpretations, 
which makes its clinical value doubtful. Also, for polygenic- 
multifactorial disorders and conditions, DTC testing panels 
include only a small percentage of the markers among many 
known associated markers, not to mention unknown ones, 
which also makes the risk prediction incomplete and, as a 

result, inaccurate. We also should not forget that gene-gene 
and  gene-environment  interactions  are  not  taken  into 
consideration for risk estimation at all. In addition, it is hard 
to say that their algorithms for estimating total combined 
risks  are  very  well  validated.  In  summary,  genome-based 
DTC tests are incomplete, and the interpretation of their 
results  is  hardly  valid.  The  biology  is  much  more  com-
plicated than some health care entrepreneurs believe, and 
genotypes and sequences are not information but are just 
basic tools to use for understanding biology. Even in the case 
of  valid  associations  that  have  been  replicated  by  many 
studies, the effect sizes of most SNPs on specific diseases 
seem to be small to modest [9]. Secondly, even though their 
customers are provided detailed background information on 
the  method  used  for  genotyping  and  the  statistical 
interpretation, which supposedly helps their understanding, 
there is still ample possibility for misconceptions. 

Some  professional  societies  have  issued  statements  on 
DTC  genetic  testing.  The  American  College  of  Medicine 
Genetics  said,  in  their  2003  statement,  that  due  to  the 
complexities of testing and counseling, patients’ use of DTC 
genetic  testing  kits  may  pose  harms,  which  include  the 
following:  test  utilization  for  inappropriate  purposes, 
misinterpretation  of  test  results,  and  lack  of  necessary 
follow-up [10]. In 2007, the American Society of Human 
Genetics also expressed their concerns in a statement on 
DTC genetic testing, saying that consumers are at risk of 
harm  if  the  quality  of  tests  is  not  high  enough−i.e.,  the 
analytical or clinical validity and clinical utility of tests are 
not  appropriate  [11].  Analytical  validity  shows  how 
accurately  and  reliably  the  test  detects  a  specific  genetic 
variant. Clinical validity shows how well the genetic variant 
is related to the existence or risk of a specific disease or 
condition.  Clinical  utility  shows  how  likely  the  test  can 
improve patient outcomes [12]. Consumers are also at risk 
of harm if claims made about tests are misleading or simply 
false  and  if  information  and  counseling  are  not  properly 
provided  to  enable  the  consumer  to  make  an  informed 
decision about whether to take the test or not and about 
what actions to take after the genetic test [11]. Due to these 
criticisms  and  repeated  interventions  from  regulators, 
including the US FDA, especially in the United States, the 
DTC market does not look very promising at this moment. 
Even one Nature Editorial said that DTC genetic testing is not 
yet a viable business model, and most firms in the market 
have  stopped  providing  services  involved  with  personal 
disease risk estimation or have even totally shut down [2].

FDA’s Action

On November 22, 2013, the US FDA sent a warning letter 

152

www.genominfo.org

to 23andMe, Inc. and ordered the company to immediately 
cease marketing of their Saliva Collection Kit and PGS until 
it received proper marketing authorization for the device [1]. 
This letter was sent after the firm failed to provide additional 
information on the analytical and clinical validity of the PGS 
the FDA requested. It said that although the FDA has been 
diligently working to help the company comply with regul-
atory requirements since July 2009, it stopped communi-
cating with the FDA since May. Apparently making matters 
worse,  the  company  initiated  new  marketing  campaigns, 
including  TV  commercials.  This  made  the  FDA  conclude 
that  the  company  intends  to  expand  the  PGS’s  uses  and 
consumer base without obtaining marketing authorization 
from the agency [2]. The FDA clearly stated that their PGS 
requires marketing approval, because it is intended for use 
“in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, 
mitigation,  treatment,  or  prevention  of  disease,  or  is 
intended to affect the structure or function of the body.” In 
other  words,  the  FDA  considers  the  PGS  an  unclassified 
medical  device,  which  requires  premarket  approval  or  de 
novo classification [1]. 

After receiving the letter, on November 26, 2014, Wojcicki 
acknowledged in a blog post that they were behind schedule 
with their responses to the FDA and that the agency needs to 
be convinced of the quality of their PGS data. On December 
5, 2013, the company announced that it would suspend its 
health-related genetic tests to comply with the US FDA’s 
directive during the regulatory review process [13]. Based on 
the letter, the FDA does not seem to think that the analytical 
validity of 23andMe’s SNP genotyping is a problem per se as 
far as its results are correct but feels that the clinical validity 
of  risk  estimation  has  yet  to  be  validated,  which  may  be 
practically impossible. After that, 23andMe announced that 
it has been working with the FDA, and the agency seemed to 
consider the firm’s response to be adequate [14]. However, 
the firm is not able to provide any timeline for resuming their 
PGS.

Various Reactions

The  US  FDA’s  action  evoked  mixed  reactions.  Some 
expressed  their  concerns,  saying  that  the  FDA  is  over-
cautious  and  paternalistic  and  hinders  medical  advances. 
According  to  Green  and  Farahany  [3],  the  FDA’s  action 
violates the rights of individuals to receive information and 
of ‘commercial speech’ and undermines the democratization 
of health care and patient empowerment. Also, they were 
concerned that this kind of overcautious regulation might 
stifle the consumer genomics field itself and insisted that the 
agency  should  not  restrict  DTC  genomic  testing  without 
empirical evidence of harm. However, rather ironically, they 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

ended  up  emphasizing  the  PGS’s  poor  clinical  utility  by 
saying  that  health-related  interpretations  of  the  PGS, 
particularly  about  common  genetic  variants,  relate  only 
indirectly to preventing or diagnosing disease [4]. If their 
comment is true, what is the point of taking the test? It is 
simply  not  ethical  to  entice  people  to  pay  for  useless 
products.  One  non-profit  technology  policy  think  tank, 
called TechFreedom, launched an online petition asking the 
FDA  to  reverse  the  ban  and  collected  a  total  of  10,073 
signatures on January 18, 2014 [15]. Many petitioners said 
that their genetic codes belong to them, so they have the 
“right  to  know”  what  is  written  there,  and  that  the 
assumption that they should be “protected from knowing” 
because they are not smart enough to understand is simply 
insulting. All of these concerns are understandable, but we 
insist that genetic testing with scientific flaws itself is a great 
harm  to  consumers  and  that  those  flaws  need  to  be 
addressed before discussing the protection of anyone’s right 
to know or not to know.

Of course, there are many people who support the FDA’s 
action as protection of consumers from potentially invalid 
and  almost  useless  information.  Among  the  professional 
proponents,  Baudhuin  emphatically  wrote  in  her  opinion 
paper that if it is too burdensome to prove the validity of the 
information  that  the  DTC  testing  companies  offer,  they 
should not sell the information in the first place [2]. Some 
consumers are already initiating procedures for class-action 
lawsuits  against  23andMe,  claiming  that  it  is  selling 
misleading information [2]. On November 27, 2013, just 5 
days after the FDA’s warning letter was sent to 23andMe, the 
first class-action lawsuit was already filed in the Southern 
District Court of California [16]. However, even among the 
supporters,  some  people  saw  the  FDA’s  action  as  rather 
unusual,  because  the  decision  was  largely  based  on  its 
theoretical harm rather than actual harm, which the FDA has 
usually been waiting for before acting.

In Korea, Lee and Lee [4] of the KHIDI submitted a report 
in  June  2014  to  the  PPJRAI,  titled  “Market  Analysis  and 
Strategies  for  Regulatory  Reform  in  Medical  Industry,” 
which expressed a stance somehow different from that of the 
US FDA [4]. In this report, they suggested that it will help to 
expand  the  PGS  market  if  genetic  testing  agencies  are 
exempted from providing at least two scientific reports to 
support or prove the clinical validity of their tests when they 
make  a  notification  of  their  testing  items  for  disease 
prevention  to  the  Korea  Center  for  Disease  Control  and 
Prevention  [4].  This  recommendation  seems  to  be  in 
opposition to the US FDA’s. Also, they recommended an 
amendment to the Bioethics and Safety Act, which will allow 
non-medical institutions, such as biotechnology companies, 
to perform health-related PGSs, at least for disease predic-

tion  and  prevention  (not  diagnosis)  [4].  However,  they 
added that this predictive, preventive genetic testing should 
be performed under the supervision of physicians, like the 
US FDA insists. Since these recommendations are supposed 
be delivered to the ministries involved in regulating genetic 
testing,  we  may  guess  which  direction  our  governmental 
regulation system will take in the near future.

23andMe  is  now  working  to  get  FDA  approval  for  its 
health tests; the company submitted seven health-related 
tests to the FDA for review in July 2014; it plans to submit 
100 additional tests before the end of the year [17]. However, 
it is very likely that this process will take years. However, 
they have been trying different strategies, including finding 
new  markets.  From  October  2014,  23andMe  has  begun 
selling its health-related genetic tests in Canada, despite still 
being  blocked  by  the  US  FDA  from  offering  its  health 
risk-related service [18].

Future Implications of the US FDA’s Action

Downing and Ross wrote that sales of DTC genetic tests, 
including 23andMe’s PGS, could be resumed only if reliable 
data have been accumulated that can demonstrate that the 
tests have positive clinical validity and can be used safely 
without  professional  supervision  [19].  As  we  mentioned 
above, this task is easier said than done−it can be practically 
impossible. Even the same authors actually emphasized the 
importance of the physician’s role in the same article, which 
can  “contextualize”  test  results  for  maximizing  clinical 
benefit, preventing adverse effects, and genuinely empower-
ing patients [19]. Zettler et al. [20] wrote that the FDA’s 
warning to 23andMe may effectively mark the end of the 
DTC genetic testing field, at least in the United States, if 
23andMe’s PGS cannot meet the FDA’s standards for clinical 
validity. DTC genetic testing companies, such as Navigenics 
and  deCODEme,  were  already  sold  to  other  firms  and 
stopped  their  health-related  services  in  2012  [20].  The 
problem is that no one knows, at the moment, how strict the 
FDA’s standards for clinical validity will be.

Another question will definitely be this: what will happen 
to whole-genome and exome sequencing, which is already 
replacing single-gene tests or SNP chips, in terms of clinical 
application?  Interestingly,  just  3  days  before  warning 
23andMe,  the  FDA  authorized  Illumina  to  market  four 
“next-generation”  gene  sequencing  devices:  a  sequencing 
platform,  two  assays−the  MiSeqDx  Cystic  Fibrosis  139- 
Variant  Assay  and  MiSeqDx  Cystic  Fibrosis  Clinical  Se-
quencing Assay−and a “universal kit” that allows labora-
tories that purchase the platform to develop and validate 
sequencing of any part of a patient’s genome and to find any 
differences between the patient and the reference [21]. What 

made the difference in the fate of these two companies? We 
have not made an inquiry about this directly to the US FDA 
but can get some clues from the FDA’s press release about 
this authorization. First of all, it said that these assays will 
check “specific points in the patient’s CFTR gene sequence” 
to detect known and unknown variants. Their reports will 
include  the  existence  of  genetic  variants  in  the  gene 
sequence that are known to be associated with one specific 
disease but will not provide medical interpretations of the 
findings. Second, it did not mention non-patient customers 
at  all.  Finally,  the  press  release  also  emphasized  the 
clinician’s involvement. It said that “this information-rich 
technology  is  becoming  more  accessible  for  use  by 
physicians in the care of their patients” and that “the new 
technology also gives physicians the ability to take a broader 
look  at  their  patients’  genetic  makeup  and  can  help  in 
diagnosing disease or identifying the cause of symptoms” 
[21].  We  believe  that  the  US  FDA’s  authorization  of  the 
MiSeqDX  for  cystic  fibrosis  reflects  the  agency’s  attitude 
towards any tests involving the human genome. Therefore, 
from this, we can guess the answer to the question we posed 
above: any genetic/genome/exome tests will be required to 
prove their analytical and clinical validity and clinical utility 
for specific diseases and conditions if they are intended for 
medical  applications.  Until  then,  we  suggest  that  their 
application should be restricted to research applications and 
family studies for diagnosing genetic disorders of unknown 
etiology. When a human being is involved, we believe that 
the most important ethics principle is “Do no harm.”
