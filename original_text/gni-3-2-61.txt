Introduction 
Recently,  as  an  international  collaborative  project,  we 
reported  the  entire  DNA sequence  of  the  euchromatic 
region  of  chimpanzee  chromosome  22  (PTR22)  and 
compared 
the  whole  chromosome  with  human 
chromosome  21  (HSA21)  (Watanabe  eta/.,  2004).  We 
found  that  PTR22  and  HSA21  differ  at  approximately 
1.44% of their 33 million aligned nucleotides. In addition 
we reported nearly 68,000 insertion or deletions (indels). 
The number of indels is approximately one seventh the 
numbers of  point mutations accumulated over the time 
since  human  and  chimpanzees  diverged.  Since  each 
indel  involves  the  change  of  several  nucleotides,  this 
result  confirms  Britten's  estimates  (Britten,  2002)  that 
indels  are  a  major  soruce  of  sequence  divergence 
between  human  and  chimpanzees.  Indeed  comparing 
231  orthologous genes on  the chromosome,  we  found 
that  15  orthologs  have  indels  within  their  coding 
sequences and  32  have changes  in  the  start codon  or 
stop  codon,  which  would  potentially  lead  to  gross 
structural differences between human and chimpanzee 
protein products. These results led us hyperthesize that 
indels and structural changes may represent one of the 
major  mechanisms  of  proteom  evolution  in  the  higher 
primates. 

Among  15  kinds  of  indels  between  human  and 
chimpanzee  orthologous  genes,  TCP10L 
is  a 
representative  having  indel  within  its coding  sequence 
(Watanabe eta/., 2004). The  TCP10L showed 16 base 
pair  differences  in  genomic  DNA  sequence  between 
human  and  chimpzanzee.  The  primary  structure  of 
human TCP1 OL contains the representative character of 
the leucine zipper motif, with a leucine residue in every 
seventh  position.  The  leucine  zipper  motif  has  been 
observed in a number of proteins thought to function as 
eukaryotic  transcription  factors  (Amati  et  a/.,  1993; 
Perez  eta/., 2001;  Sellers  eta/.,  1989).  Especially, the 
gene in human is known to be specifically expressed in 
the liver and testis (Chen eta/., 2003) but not in 28 other 
tissues, and the protein is accumulated in nucli (Chen et 
a/.,  2003).  The  subcellular  localization  and  the  leucine 
zipper structure of the protein suggested that it functions 
as a transcription factor. Indeed, human TCP10L has an 
activity of transcription repressor and the leucine zipper 
is  indispensable  to  the  biological  functions  of  the 
transcription factors (Chen eta/., 2003). It has long been

argued  that  changes  in  gene  regulation  may be  more 
important to morphological and functional evolution than 
overall  genomic  divergence  (Cherty  eta/.,  1978).  To 
study this old issue, transcription factors can be a good 
candidate  because the change  of transcription  factors 
could result in a global change in gene regulation. In this 
study,  we  analyze  and  compare  genomic  structure  of 
TCP1 OL  gene  between  human  and  chimpanzee  and 
consequently discuss its implication in  liver physiology 
and primate evolution. 

Results and Discussion 
Genorric structure of TCPta. gene in ChirT(lal1Zee 
and Human 
Genomic  organization  of  human  TCP10L  gene  was 
reported  by Chen et al.  previously (Chen  eta/., 2003). 
The TCP10L is localized at chromosome 21 p22.11, and 
its  genomic size  is  8955 bp.  As  shown  Fig.  1 ,  human 
TCP10L was composed of five exons and four introns. To 
understand  the  genomic  characters  of  chimpanzee 

TCP10L, we predicted genomic structure of chimpanzee 
TCP10L  using SIM4 program  (Florea  eta/.,  1998) that 
run by matching human Ref.Seq as a query sequence to 
chimpanzee genomic DNA sequence. The chimpanzee 
TCP10L  showed  genomic size of 8615 bp and  similar 
exon  and  intron  structure  with  human  TCP10L.  DNA 
sequence similarity of the TCP1 OL gene between human 
and chimpanzee was 97.8% in total and similarities for 
each  exons  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Next,  we  tried  to 
speculate the changes in CDS of human TCP1 OL caused 
by  the  genomic  change.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  human 
TCP10L has 9 base substitution and 16 bp indel in exon 
4.  The  16 bp  indel  in  exon  4  resulted  in  frame  shift of 
protein  coding  structure  and  also  inactivation  of  stop 
codon.  As a result,  the human  TCP10L showed  longer 
CDS of 63 base pair than that of chimpanzees.

Implication of  TCP10L changes in physiological 
function of testis and liver 
In this study, we show that human TCP1 OL has 16 base 
pair difference in genomic DNA compare to chimpanzee 
ortholog. As a consequence, frame shift mutation occurs 
in CDS of human TCP10L and affects to human express 
as longer protein of 21  amino acid residues than that of 
chimpanzee.  Our  further  analysis 
the 
changes of primary structure of human TCP10L resulted 
in  dramatic changes  in  secondary structure  prediction. 
Functional  study  showed  that  human  TCP10L 
is 
deduced to be 215 amino acids polypeptide and a typical 
leucine zipper motif exists  in  the  middle of the peptide 
(Chen  et at.,  2003). The leucine zipper is DNA binding 
motif  and  indispensable  to  the  biological  functions  of 
these transcription factors through dimerization.  Based 
on these facts,  the structural changes in the C-terminal 
region  of  TCP10L  protein  may  not  affect  the  DNA 
binding  function  of  this  transcription  repressor.  More 
likely the C-terminal  changes  would  affect some  other 
function of human  TCPt OL such as interacting potential 

to other transcription factors or stability of the protein.  It 
has been known that the TCP10L interact with MAD as a 
transcription  factor  (Jiang  eta/., 2004).  More  recently, 
Yu et al.  reported that  TCP10L  is expressed in nucleus 
of  spermatogenic  cell  and  bind  to  death  associated 
protein  kinase-3  (DAPK-3)  (Yu  et a/.,  2005).  Base  on 
this,  they  suggested  that  TCP10L  might  play  crucially 
important 
its 
interaction  with  DAPK-3.  However,  it  is  not  clear that 
for 
C-terminal 
interaction with DAP-3.  In this point, our finding through 
comparative study of chimpanzee and  human  TCP10L 
can  supply  new  approach  method  to  understand  the 
roles of TCP10L in spermatogenesis.

showed that gene expression patterns in human liver are 
more similar to those of the chimpanzee than to those of 
macaques  (Enard  et at.  2002).  These  results  coincide 
with 
the  species 
suggesting that gene expression patterns in liver reflect 
the evolutionary relationship in the primates. The liver is 
an essential organ playing a central  role in  metabolism 
and detoxification of poisonous substances. Therefore, 
these changes  in  liver physiology might be  required to 
adapt  new environment such  as  changes  of food  and 
xenobiotics.  The  various  genes  participating  in  these 
metabolic reactions are regulated on transcription revel
