Abstract 
We identified differentially expressed genes in RAW 264.7 
cells in response to single and double ligand treatments 
(LPS, IFNy, 2MA, LPS plus IFNy, and LPS plus2MA). The 
majority of the regulated transcripts responded additively 
to dual ligand treatment.  However,  a significant fraction 
responded  in  a non-additive fashion.  Several  cytokines 
showing  non-additive transcriptional  responses  to  dual 
ligand  treatment  also  showed  non-additive  protein 
production/secretion responses in separately performed 
experiments.  Many  of  the  genes  with  non-additive 
responses to LPS plus 2MA showed enhanced responses 
and encoded  pro-inflammatory proteins.  LPS plus  IFNy 
appeared to induce both non-additive enhancement and 
non-additive attenuation of gene expression.  The affected 
genes  were  associated  with  a  variety  of  biological 
functions. These experiments reveal both dependent and 
independent  regulatory  pathways  and  point  out  the 
specific nature of the regulatory interactions.

Introduction 
Toll-like  receptors  {TLRs)  recognize  distinct  pathogen(cid:173)
associated  molecular  patterns  (PAMPs),  such  as 
lipopolysaccharides  (LPS)  of  Gram-negative  bacteria 
(Akira eta/., 2006). Binding of PAMPs to TLRs triggers a 
complicated  series  of  events  leading  to  increased 
expression of proinflammatory genes. To date, 10 human 
and 13 murine proteins related to the Drosophila Toll have 
been  characterized  (Kawai  and  Akira,  2006).  For 
example, TLR2 is essential for the signaling of a variety of

ligands, such as peptidoglycan, a main wall component of 
Gram-positive  bacteria,  lipopeptides  and  lipoproteins 
(Takeuchi eta/., 2000). TLR2 cooperates with other TLR 
family members, TLR1  and TLR6, to discriminate among 
different  microbial  components.  TLR3  mediates  the 
response to double-stranded viral  RNA (Aiexopoulou et 
a/., 2001 ).  TLR4 is considered to be the critical component 
of  the  LPS  receptor  complex  (Hayashi  et  a/.,  2001; 
Hoshino eta/., 1999; Poltorak eta/., 1998).  TLRS binds 
bacterial  flagellin  from  both  Gram-positive  and  Gram(cid:173)
negative  bacteria  (Hayashi  et  a/.,  2001).  TLR9  binds 
unmethylated cytosine-guanosine (CpG) dinucleotide, a 
sequence typifying bacterial and viral DNA (Hemmi eta/., 
2000).  Depending on the type of cell, TLR activation could 
lead to a variety of activities, such as antigen-presenting 
cell  activation,  dendritic  cell  maturation  and  B  cell 
activation. 

LPS is the major constitute of the outer membrane of 
Gram-negative bacteria.  In blood, LPS forms a complex 
with serum protein LBP  (LPS-binding protein).  LPS binds 
cell surface receptor CD14 to enhance TLR4-dependent 
LPS recognition. After TLR4 forms a complex with protein 
MD-2, the complex is transported to the cell surface  (Akira 
eta/., 2001; Takeda eta/., 2003; Yamamoto eta/., 2003). 
TLR4  is  a  membrane  protein  with  an  extracellular 
leucine-rich repeat domain and a cytoplasmic Tl R (Toll-like/ 
interleukin-1  receptor) domain.  In addition to LPS, TLR4 
recognizes  several  other  ligands  including  Taxol  and 
HSPs (heat shock proteins). 

TLR4 activates two  downstream pathways,  MyD88-
dependent pathway and  MyD88-independent pathway, 
each of which  is thought to directly activate  NFKB.  The 
MyD88-dependent  pathway  recruits  the  kinases, 
interleukin-1  receptor-associated  kinase  1 (IRAK1) and 
IRAK4,  which  phosphorylate  TNF  receptor-associated 
factor  6  (TRAF6),  leading  to  the  activation  of the  IKK 
complex. The MyD88-independent pathway is dependent 
on the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon(cid:173)
~ {Trif) adaptor molecule and Trif-related adaptor molecule 
(Tram). However, the genes regulated by TLR4 activation 
are not fully understood. 

In  an  attempt  to  characterize  how  TLR4-mediated 
signal transduction can be activated by LPS, we applied 
LPS in the murine macrophage-like cell line RAW 264.7 
for  a  series  of  time  points.  In  addition,  to  determine 
whether simultaneous stimulation with  two  ligands  had 
non-additive effects on  gene expression  in  RAW cells,

three ligands [LPS,  IFNy and  2MA (2-methyl-thio-ATP)] 
which activate distinct proximal signaling pathways were 
used alone or in combination as dual  ligands (LPS plus 
2MA and  LPS plus  IFNy).  Gene expression  changes at 
multiple time points relative to the time-matched  media 
control  were  determined  using  homemade  16K 
oligonucleotide microarrays. 

Methods 
Experimental design 
RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LPS (Sigma- Aldrich), 
IFNy (R & D Systems), 2MA (Sigma-Aldrich), LPS plus IFN 
y,  and LPS plus 2MA for up to 4 h. Cells were collected at 
multiple time points and RNAs were extracted. The same 
experiment  was  repeated  three  times.  RNA  samples 
collected at each replicate experiment were processed for 
microarray hybridization as described in Zhu eta/. {Zhu et 
a/., 2004). The expression changes in each treated RNA 
sample were  measured  with  two  oligonucleotide  chips 
using the dye-swap design. Fig. 1 contains further details 
of the experimental design. 

Data processing 
The arrays were scanned using Agilent Scanner G2505A 
(Agilent Technologies).  The image files were extracted 
with  background-subtraction  {the  Local  background 
subtraction  method)  and  dye-normalization  {the  Rank 

consistent filter  and  the  LOWESS  algorithm)  using  the 
Agilent  G2566AA Extraction  Software Version  A.6.1.1. 
Log2(Cy5/Cy3) readouts from each array were first filtered 
by several criteria to mainly remove unreliable array spots. 
For  features  that  were  control,  saturated  (with 
"glsSaturated"  and  "rlsSaturated"  flags),  non-uniform 
(with "glsFeatNonUnifOL" and "rlsFeatNonUnifOL" flags), 
or  below  background  (with  "glsWeiiAboveBG"  and 
"rlsWeiiAboveBG" flags),  their log2(Cy5/Cy3) value was 
set to blank.  Additional filters were applied to eliminate 
inconsistent  measurements.  The  average  log2(treated/ 
media) of the pair of dye-swap measurements of a feature 
was set to blank if one of the measurements was blank. 
Further, the average log2(treated/media) of the triplicate 
measurements of a feature was set to blank if more than 
one of the measurements were blank. 

Identify differentially expressed genes in response 
to ligand treatment 
We  limited  our  analysis  to  genes  whose  expression 
significantly  changed  in  response  to  at  least  one  of the 
treatments.  We  have  identified  differentially  expressed 
genes using B statistics generated by the Limma package 
(http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/limma/) (Smyth, 2004 and 2005). 
Briefly, the B statistics is the log odds of differential expression 
[IOQ1o  (p1/p2),  where  p1 
is  the  probability  that  the  two 
populations are different and p2 is the probability that the two 
populations are the same]. The B statistics has been adjusted 
for multiple tests in Limma package. The greater B statistics

expression. In general, B increases with log2(treated/ control). 
In the current analysis, features with B:::: 2 and with an average

considered differentially expressed. 

Results and Discussion 
The number of differentially expressed features 

As shown in Fig.  2,  single ligand treatment with LPS and 

IFNy for up to 4 h induced increasing numbers of gene 
expression changes, with approximately twice as many 
significant changes  in  LPS  responses.  2MA induced  a 
similar  number  of  changes  as  IFNy  at  1  h  and  the 
number  of differentially  expressed  features  appeared 
to decrease with time.  Greater numbers of differentially 
expressed genes were found  in  response to  LPS  plus 
IFNy or LPS plus 2MA than those found in single ligand 
responses, and this may be attributable to both additive 
and non-additive effects of the two single ligands.

Characterization of gene expression changes in 
response to single ligand treatment with LPS, IFN 
y,  or2MA 

Before we proceeded to determine the non-additive effect 

on  gene  expression  of  dual  ligand  treatment,  we 
characterized gene expression changes in single ligand 
responses.  This will  allow us  (a)  to  validate  previously 
reported  expression  changes  induced  by  the  single 
ligands, and (b) to identify potential novel target genes of 

Single and Dual Ligand  Effects on Gene Expression Changes in Mouse Macrophage Cells  61 

specific signaling  pathways if the genes co-cluster with 
well-characterized known targets. Information of the latter 
kind  can  be  useful  in  identifying  pathway  interaction 
mechanisms  if some  of the  novel  targets  are  affected 
non-additively by dual ligand treatments. 

We  used  hierarchical  clustering 

to  characterize 
patterns  of  gene  expression  changes.  Clustering  was 
done  across  the  features  with  experimental  conditions 
aligned according to the order of time points.  Euclidean 
correlation coefficient and complete linkage were used as 
similarity  metrics.  The  hierarchical  clustering  program 
used  is  implemented  in  the  Multiple  Experiment Viewer 
{http://www.tigr.org/software/tm4/mev.html). Single ligand 
treatment  with  LPS,  IFNy,  and  2MA all  induced  strong 
expression changes as early as 1 h (Fig. 3). As shown in 
Fig. 3,  additional expression changes were induced at 2 
hand 4 h in  LPS and  IFNy responses,  and  many 2MA(cid:173)
induced changes were transient and subsided with time. 
A number of the known LPS- or I FNy- regulated genes 
showed expected expression changes in our experiment. 
As shown  in  Fig.  4A,  known  direct target genes of the 
MyD88-NFKB  pathway  activated  by  LPS  through  the 
TLR4,  such  as  TNFa,  IL 1 ~  and  Mail,  were  strongly 
induced at 0.5 h,  while Csf2,  Csf3,  IL6 and  Cebpb,  the 
known transcription targets of Mail, were induced later at 
1 h or 2 h (Kawai, 2001; Yamamoto eta/., 2004 ). Similarly, 
known primary target genes of another pathway activated 
by LPS, the Myd88-independent IRF3 pathway, such as 
lrg1, IP-10, Rantes, lfit1, lfnb and lsg15, were induced at 
0.5  h  or  1  h,  while  Mx1  and  lrf?,  genes  induced  by 
secreted lfnb, were up regulated later by LPS at 2 h and 
4 h,  respectively (Fig. 48) (Doyle eta/., 2002; Hoshino et 

a/.,  2002).  As shown  in  Fig.  4C,  several  reported  IFNy 
-induced immediate early genes regulated by the STAT1 
pathway, such as lrf1, lcsbp1, Stat2, IP-1 0 and lfit1, also 
increased their expression significantly at 1 h [reviewed in 
(Boehm  et a/.,  1997)].  We  also  found  several  known 
MAPK-induced genes, such as Egr1, Egr2, and Dusp2, in 
clusters of early induced genes by 2MA (Fig. 40). 

Identify  features  whose  expression  was  non(cid:173)
additively affected by dua! ligand treatments 
We  computed  the  net  expression  fold-change  in 
response  to  each  single  ligand  and  to  dual  ligand 
treatment  at  each  time  point  for  each  gene  using  the 
average  of the  triplicate  log2-ratio  measurements  after 
filtering as follows:  ( 1) Sets that do not have at least two 
data points are not used (e.g., blank, blank, 2). (2) If two 
of the triplicates show different signs and have a standard 
deviation above 0.5, the data is not used (e.g., -2, 2, 0.5). 
(3)  If one data set shows more than  a 2 fold  difference 
(log2 ratio of 1) and the other points do not, that data is not 
used, unless the standard deviation is less than 0.5. (e.g., 
3,  0.2,  0.2) (4) The remaining  data points are averaged 
and  used  in  the  analysis.  The  difference  between  the 
fold-change  induced  by  dual  ligand  and  the  sum  of 
fold-changes  induced  by single  ligands was used  as a 
measure of the non-additive effect (Fig.  5). 

We then added the fold-change differences at 1 h, 2 h, 
and  4  h together,  and  used  the  resulting  sum  to  rank 
genes  in  descending  order.  In  the current analysis,  we 
generally considered  genes that ranked  at the top (the 
sum  being  positive)  as  candidates  whose  expression 
was  enhanced  non-additively  by the  dual  ligands,  and

genes  that  ranked  at  the  bottom  (the  sum  being 
negative)  as  candidates whose  expression  was  attenu(cid:173)
ated non-additively by the dual ligand treatments. Tables 
1-4  showed  gene  expression  changes  (as  average 
logz-ratios)  of  the  single  time  point  and  the  sum 
fold-change  differences  of  these  top/bottom  ranked 
genes in responses to LPS + IFNy or LPS + 2MA. Table 
1 listed  genes  whose  expression  was  enhanced  non(cid:173)
additively  by  LPS  +  IFNy.  Non-additively  enhanced 
genes  including  IL6  and  IL 10  were  also  measured  in 
cytokine  secretion  assays.  Secreted  IL6  in  response to 

LPS  + IFNy was  clearly non-additively enhanced at 4 h 
and  a  slight  non-additive  effect  was  seen  in 
IL 10 
production  at  4  h (data  not  shown).  Other  interesting 
genes  including  Sgk,  Nola1,  Crabp2,  and  Fst  did  not 
show significant changes at most time points in response 
to either LPS or IFNy, but showed strong changes when 
LPS  and  IFNy  were  applied  together.  Whether  these 
changes are reflected at the protein level, what mechanisms 
underlie  the  changes,  and  the  nature  of  the  biological 
significance of these changes remain to be seen. Similar 
results are found  in  Tables 2-4.

Fig. 6. Identification of the expression changes indicative of the activation of specific signaling pathways. 

Socs1- and  Cish-mediated  feedback  inhibition  and 
PGE2  (prostaglandin  E2)  negative  feedback  seem  to 
attenuate the transcriptional responses to LPS plus IFNI' 
(Table  1 ).  The  increased  number of less-than-additive 
transcriptional changes induced by LPS plus IFNI' at 4 h 
(Table  2)  was  preceded  by  a  significant  induction  of 
Socs1  and  Cish  (Table  1),  genes  encoding  putative 
inhibitors of LPS, and Ptgs2 and Ptger4, genes encoding 
COX-2  and  EP4,  an  enzyme  and  a  receptor  for  the 
synthesis and binding of PGE2, respectively. 

In  response  to  LPS  plus  2MA,  the  enhancement  of 
LPS-induced expression of IFN~ at 1 hand 2 h (Table 3) 
was  followed  by  the  increased  expression  of  multiple 
interferon induced genes,  such as Gbp2,  lrf1,  Mx1,  and 
Mx2,  and the attenuation of LPS-induced expression of 
I L 1 0 at 1 h and 2 h (Table 4) correlated with the increased 
expression of IL 10 repressed genes later at 4 h including 
IL1u,  IL1~,  IL6,  IL18,  Pim1,  and  Socs1.  It  can  be 
hypothesized  that  2MA-induced  Ca2
+  mobilization 
IRF3 
activates  NFAT,  and  NFAT  synergizes  with 
activated by LPS in the transcriptional induction of IFN~. 
Consistent with this possibility, the 5' upstream region of 
the mouse and human IFN~ genes have a NFAT site, an 

IRF site overlapped with the NFAT site, and a NFKB site. 
The  IRF  site  and  the  NFKB  site  mediate  IFN~ 
transcriptional activation by IRF3 and NFKB in response 
to LPS (Doyle eta/., 2002). 

In summary, analysis of gene expression response to 
single ligands allowed us to identify expression changes 
indicative of the activation of specific signaling pathways 
(Fig.  6).  While  genes  showing  such  changes  include 
known target genes of the pathway,  novel target genes 
were also found. Computational analysis of transcriptional 
regulatory pathways activated by various ligands, such as 
TLR ligands, with palpable waves of transcription will not 
only reveal  the independent pathway of each ligand but 
also give further ideas of cross signaling networks within 
or  with  other  signal  transduction  pathways  by  further 
exploring the data.
