Abstract 
TRPV2  is  a  non-specific  cation  channel  expressed  in 
sensory  neurons,  and  activated  by  noxious  heat. 
Particularly,  TRPV2  has  six  transmembrane  domains 
and three ankyrin repeats. TRPV2 has been cloned from 
various  species  such  as  human,  rat,  and  mouse. 
Oocytes  of  Xenopus  laevis  - an  African  clawed  frog  -
have been widely used for decades in characterization of 
various  receptors  and  ion  channels.  The  functional 
property of rat TRPV2 was also identified by this oocyte 
expression system.  However,  no TRPV2 orthologue of 
Xenopus  laevis  has  been  reported  so  far.  Hence,  we 
have focused to clone a TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus 
laevis with  the  aid  of  bioinformatic tools.  Because the 
genome  sequence  of  Xenopus  laevis  is  not  available 
until now, a genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis- a 
close  relative  species  of  Xenopus  /aevis  - was  used. 
After  a  number  of  bioinformatic  searches  in  silica,  a 
predicted full-length  sequence of TRPV2 orthologue of 
Xenopus tropica/is was found.  Based on this predicted 
sequence,  various  approaches  such  as  RT-PCR  and 
5' -RACE technique were applied to clone a full length of 
Xenopus  laevis  TRV2.  Consequently,  a  full-length 
Xenopus laevis TRPV2 was cloned from heart eDNA.

Introduction 
Among the  plethora of ion  channels,  transient  receptor 
potential (TRP) channel family has gained its popularity, 
as  a  large  amount  of  TRP  channels  are  involved  in 
physiological  sensory  responses  such  as  thermal, 
mechanical  and chemical  sensations (Harteneck eta/., 
2000;  Koltzenburg,  2004;  Mantell  eta/., 2002a;  Montell

et  a/.,  2002b).  TRP  channel  was  first  discovered  in 
Drosophila  melanogaster  (Mantell,  1989;  Mantell  and 
Rubin,  1989).  Since  its  first  identification,  at  least  22 
genes were discovered as a member of TRP ion channel 
family (Clapham eta/., 2003). 

TRP  family  can  be  divided 

into  a  number  of 
sub-families, such as TRPC, TRPM and TRPV. Among 
them,  TRPM  sub-family  plays  various  roles  in  cell 
division,  cell  migration,  calcium  signaling  and  even 
thermal  sensing  (TRPM8)  (Fleig  and  Penner,  2004; 
Peier  et  a/.,  2002).  TRPV  families  are  relatively 
well-characterized ion channels in terms of thermosensation. 
TRPV1  through TRPV4 channels are known to respond 
to change in temperature, serving as molecular sensors 
of heat sensations (Gunthorpe eta/., 2002). 

TRPV2  (formerly known  as VRL 1) was cloned  from 
rat dorsal root ganglia (Caterina eta/., 1999). TRPV2 is a 
non-selective cation channel  activated  by noxious heat 
(> 52°C). Like other TRPV channels, TRPV2 contains six 
transmembrane  domains  with  a  putative  pore-loop 
region  between fifth and sixth transmembrane domains 
and  holds  three  ankyrin  repeats  at  the  cytoplasmic 
amino terminus,  where  protein-protein  interactions  are 
supposed to occur (Ferrer-Montiel eta/., 2004).  Up until 
now, a number of TRPV2 orthologues have been cloned 
from  various  species  such  as  human,  rat,  mouse  and 
cow. 

An African clawed frog, Xenopus /aevis, has been the 
choice of the heterologous expression system for testing 
cloned  ion  channels  because  of  the  ease  of  mRNA 
injection into oocytes. Still, genetic approach to this frog 
is not possible to date.  However, the genome project of 
Xenopus  tropicalis,  a  close  relative  frog  of  Xenopus 
/aevis,  is under way. One main reason for the lack of the 
genome seqeunce of Xenopus laevis is because Xenopus 
/aevis  has  some  drawbacks  compared  to  Xenopus 
tropicalis:  Xenopus  /aevis  takes  1-2  years  to  reach 
sexually maturity, whereas Xenopus tropicalis takes 3 or 
4  months  (Ishii  et  a/.,  2004).  Moreover,  Xenopus 
tropicalis has a smaller diploid genome (20 chromosomes) 
than that of Xenopus laevis (36 chromosomes). 

BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of 
the  most  widely  used  similarity  search  tools  in  data 
analysis, which is based on a heuristic method to find the 
optimal  alignments  between  genes  from  the  highest 
scoring  (Korf,  2003).  BLAST algorithm depends on the 

statistics  of  ungapped  sequence  alignment  called 
maximal segment pair (MSP). The mathematical results 
of  MSP  scores  generate  the  statistical  significance  of 
alignment between selected sequences. 

Here  in  this  study,  we  focused  to  clone  a  TRPV2 
orthologue of Xenopus laevis with the aid of bioinformatics 
tools such as BLAST based on the genome sequence of 
Xenopus tropica/is. 

Methods 
BLAST Search from  Xenopus tropicalis  Protein 
Sequences 
A  Xenopus  tropicalis  protein  sequence  file  (Xenopus 
tropicafisgarrrre asseni:lly 2.0, ''xenopus.om430.proteins.gz'') 
was  downloaded  from  Xenbase  web  site  (http://www. 
xenbase.org/). The sequence file was composed of total 
116058 computer-predicted protein sequences.  BLAST 
program  was  downloaded  from  National  Center  for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast) 
and  installed  on  Linux-based  computer.  All  sequence 
data were converted  to  support  BLAST format.  During 
the  BLAST  search,  default  parameters  were  used.  A 
human TRPV2 protein sequence is obtained from NCBI 
Genbank (gi:  8394534). 

Primer design and RT-PCR 
First-strand eDNA was synthesized from Xenopus /aevis 
heart, brain and oocytes and reverse-transcribed with 
SuperScriptTM  (Life  Technology,  Inc.)  following  the 
manufacturer's protocol. Based on the predicted Xenopus 
tropical is TRPV2 sequence (xtTRPV) , primer was designed 
manually  for  reverse  transcription-polymerase  chain 
reaction (RT -PCR). The forward primer was 5'-ATGTCG 
GGTACAGACTCAGA  TG-3'  (Primer  1)  and  reverse 
primer was  5'-CTACACCGCTGGGCTGCTI-3'  (Primer 
2).  Using these primers,  RT-PCR was carried out under 
following conditions : 94°C X 5 min, 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C 
X 30 sec, 72°C X 2 min at 30 cycles/ 72°C X 1 0 min using 
PCR thermal cycler (TAKARA). 

RT-PCR primers of highly-conserved region between 
TRPV2  orthologues  were  designed  as  following:  The 
forward  primer  was  5'-CTACTACCGAGGCCAGAC-3' 
(Primer 3) and reverse primer was 5'-CAGCAGGAGGA 
TGTAGGTC-3'  (Primer 4).  RT-PCR was carried out as 
following conditions: 94°C X 5 min, 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C 
X 30 sec,  72°C X 1 min 30 sec at 30 cycles/ 72°C X 1 0 
min using PCR thermal cycler (TAKARA). 

Based on the conserved 3' -region of Xenopus laevis 
EST  (expressed  sequence  tag)  fragments,  a  new 
reverse  primer  (Primer  5)  was  designed  as  5'-CTACA 

Cloning of Xenopus Jaevis TRPV2 by Gene Prediction  25 

CGTCCGGAGTGCT-3'.  These  three  EST  fragments 
were acquired from NCBI (gi : 14185141, 33627140 and 
34884469).  RT-PCR  was  performed  under  the  same 
previous conditions. 

5'-RACE 
First-strand  eDNA for  5' -RACE  (Rapid-Amplification  of 
eDNA Ends) of xiTRPV2 was synthesized from Xenopus 
laevis  heart  with  TAKARA  5'-Full  RACE  Core  set 
following manufacturer's protocol (Takara, Osaka, Japan). 
In  briefly,  first-strand  eDNA  was  amplified  by  PCR 
(polymerase chain reaction)  in  a volume of 15 fJ}l  using 
total  RNA 5 flg,  10x RT Buffer,  RNase Inhibitor (40units/ 
!J}l), AMV Reverse Transcriptase and 5' end-phosphorylated 
RT -Primer  5' -ATGCTGCATCCA-3'.  The  amplification 
program was 30°C X 10 min I 50°C X 60 min I 80°C X 2 
min using a thermal cycler (TAKARA). PCR product was 
stored at 4°C. 

Hybrid  RNA from  the  synthesized first-strand  eDNA 
was selectively degraded by RNase H.  5X Hybrid RNA 
Degradation  Buffer  and  RNase  H  was  added 
in 
first-strand eDNA, and then incubated at 30 oc for 1 hour. 
Following step for ligation reaction  (circularization of 
single-stranded  eDNA,  or  formation  of  concatemers) 
was performed by adding the reagents in volume of 40fl,Q 
using 5x RNA (ssDNA) Ligation Buffer, 40% PEG #6000, 
1 fJ}l  single-stranded  eDNA  collected  by  ethanol 
precipitation, and 1 fJ}l  of T4 RNA Ligase and incubating 
at 15°C for overnight. Then, this product was used as a 
template for 5'RACE PCR and stored at -20°C. 

5'RACE  PCR  was  done  by  2  step  PCR  reactions. 
Primers were prepared for 1st PCR reaction.  1st PCR S1 
Primer  was  5' -GACATGTCTGCTGAAGGC-3'  and  1st 
PCR A 1 Primer was 5' -CTGGTIGCTTICCA TIGCC-3'. 
5'RACE template was amplified by PCR using TAKARA 
LA Taq™. The 5'RACE 1st PCR condition was 94"C X 3 m'1n 
1 94°C X 30 sec, 55°C X 30 sec , 72°C X 2 min at 25 cycles. 
The 2nd  PCR template was obtained from  product of 
1st  PCR.  To  assure  a  clear  PCR  product,  2nd  PCR 
templates were  prepared  by 3 dilutions (no dilution,  10 
fold,  and 100 fold) of the 1st PCR product.  The 2nd  PCR 
primers  were  also  ready  for  experiment.  2nd  PCR  S2 
Primer  was  5'-CCGATACTGCTGGAAGCT-3'  and  2nd 
PCR A2 Primer was 5' -CAGGTGAGTAGTCGTCACT -3'. 
The  2nd  5'RACE  PCR  was  also  amplified  by  using 
TAKARA  LA  Taq™.  The 5'RACE 2nd  PCR amplification 
program was 94°C  X 30 sec,  55°C X 30 sec,  72°C X 2 
min at 25 cycles.

Results 
BLASTP search was done to identify a TRPV2 orthologue 
of  Xenopus  tropicalis  among  its  computer-predicted 

116,058  protein  sequences.  As  a  result,  the  most 
probable  TRPV2  orthologue  sequence  was  found  and 
named  as  xtTRPV2.  In  order  to  make  clear  that  this 
xtTRPV2  sequence  was  a  real  orthologue  of  TRPV2, 
additional BLASTP search was done with xtTRPV2 as a 
query  sequence  against  NCBI  non-redundant  (nr) 
database.  Indeed,  the  search  result  clarified  that  the 
xtTRPV2  was  a  true  TRPV2  orthologue  of  Xenopus 
tropicalis.  With 
full-length  xtTRPV2 
sequence, custom primers were designed. RT-PCR was 
carried out over Xenopus laevis heart,  brain and oocyte 
eDNA.  As shown in  Fig.  1,  size of the RT-PCR product 
with Primer 1 and Primer 2 should be around 2,1 00 base 
pair long.  However, no PCR product was obtained (Fig. 
1A).  Although  various  temperature  conditions  of  PCR 
program  were  attempted  (45,  50,  55  and  60•  C  as 
annealing  temperatures),  no  apparent  bands  were 
detected. These results indicate that TRPV2 orthologue 
of Xenopus laevis is not identical to that of xtTRPV2. 

this  predicted 

that  match 

(Primer  3  and  Primer  4) 

We  thus  searched  a  highly-conserved  region  in 
Xenopus  laevis  TRPV2.  To  confirm  this,  new  primer 
to 
pairs 
highly-conserved region were constructed using multiple 
alignments with  xtTRPV2  and  other TRPV2  orthologs. 
RT-PCR with Primer 3 and Primer 4 pairs should amplify 
the product within a range of 1,1 OObp through  1 ,400bp. 
Indeed, as depicted in  Fig.  1 B,  a strong PCR band was 
found in Xenopus laevis heart eDNA. However, any PCR 
product  was  found  in  the  brain  and  oocytes.  These 
results show that TRPV2 orthologue of Xenopus laevis is 
present in the heart, but rarely in the brain and oocytes. 
We then swapped primers alternatively as shown in Fig. 
1.  RT-PCR with Primer 1 and Primer 4 detected a PCR 
product  within  a  range  of  1, 700  - 2,000  bp  (Fig.  1 C). 
However, RT-PCR with Primer 3 and Primer 2 detected a 
dim and weak band  (Fig.  1 D).  These data indicate that 
Primer 1, not Primer 2, matches to TRPV2 orthologue of 
Xenopus  laevis.  Thus,  it was  concluded  that  a  new  3' 
reverse primer is required to clone a full-length TRPV2 
orthologue from Xenopus /aevis. 

Fortunately,  3'-EST  fragments  of  Xenopus  /aevis 
(Genbank  Index  number  14185141,  33627140  and 
34884469)  were  found  in  BLAST,  which  facilitated  the 
designing  of  a  new  3'  reverse  primer  (Primer  5). 
However, this new reverse primer (Primer 5)  has a few 
different  bases  compared  to  Primer  2.  RT-PCR  with 
Primer 1 and Primer 5 was done against Xenopus laevis 
heart, brain, and oocytes. We then found a PCR product 
with expected size of 2.1  Kb  in the heart,  but not in the 
brain  and  oocytes  (Fig.  1 E).  After  confirmation  by 
sequencing  analysis,  it  was  found  that  this  product  is 
conisted of total 2319 nucleotides.

Fig.  3.  Alignment of xtTRPV2 and xiTRPV2 sequence. 
Black box indicates that both sequences are identical; dark gray box 
indicates  that  both  sequences  are  80  percent  homology.  Ught  gray 
means  60  percent  homology and  white  for  non-match.  Note that  "-" 
refers to gap alignment. 

In  order  to  confirm  the  sequence  in  the  5'  region, 
5'-RACE was carried out as shown in Fig. 2A. As a result, 
we confirmed the full  length of TRPV2  orthologue from 
Xenopus  laevis.  As  shown  in  Fig.  28,  there  were  3 
mismatches  in  the  5'  start  region.  We  named  it  as 
'xiTRPV2' hereafter. 

As  represented  in  Fig.  3,  xiTRPV2  sequence  was 
aligned  with  xtTRPV2.  xtTRPV2  was  2142  base  pair 
long,  whereas  xiTRPV2  was  2319  base  pair  long. 
Similarity between xiTRPV2 and xtTRPV2 was very high 
(about  90%),  although 
two  regions  were  notably 
different. 

Based  on  the  xiTRPV2  DNA  sequence,  xiTRPV2 
protein  sequence  was  obtained  by  translation  in  silica 
(Fig. 4).  It is composed of 773 amino acids and holds six 
transmembrane  domains  and  three  ankyrin  repeats  at 
N-terminal.  This  indicates  that  xiTRPV2  shares  a 
common  characteristic  of  other  TRPV2  in  terms  of 
predicted protein topologies. 

To  compare  the  similarity  between  xiTRPV2  and 
other TRPV2 orthologues,  multiple alignment was done 
by  ClustaiW  (Fig.  5A)  (Li,  2003).  xiTRPV2  has  50%

Discussion 
TRPV2  is  heat-sensitive,  non-selective cation  channel 
found  in  various  species  including  mammals.  Even 
though mammalian TRPV2 is known,  the presence of a 
TRPV2 orthologue in Xenopus /aevis is not known even 
though  frequent  use  of  the  amphibian  oocytes  as 
heterologous  expression  system.  We  thus  cloned  and 
identified a full length of TRPV2 orthologue in  Xenopus 
/aevis. 
We

sequence  of  xtTRPV2.  But,  RT-PCR  with  Primer  1-2 
pairs  that  were  based  on  the  orthologue  of  Xenopus 
tropicaliswas unable to detect any product from selected 
tissues  under various  PCR conditions.  This  result was 
rather  anticipated  because 
there  was  a  species 
difference between the  predicted  sequence which  was 
xtTRPV2  and  the  source  of  PCR  template  DNA 
(Xenopus laevis). In addition, the reason for the RT-PCR 
failure would stem from an imperfect prediction of the full 
genome sequence of Xenopus tropicalis,  which is often 
the case in prediction of exons in silico.
