Oxidative  stress,  which  results  in  an  excessive  product  of  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS),  is  one  of  the  fundamental 
mechanisms of the development of hypertension. In the vascular system, ROS have physical and pathophysiological roles in 
vascular  remodeling  and  endothelial  dysfunction.  In  this  study,  ROS-hypertension-related  genes  were  collected  by  the 
biological literature-mining tools, such as SciMiner and gene2pubmed, in order to identify the genes that would cause 
hypertension  through  ROS.  Further,  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  located  within  these  gene  regions  were 
examined statistically for their association with hypertension in 6,419 Korean individuals, and pathway enrichment analysis 
using the associated genes was performed. The 2,945 SNPs of 237 ROS-hypertension genes were analyzed, and 68 genes 
were significantly associated with hypertension (p ＜ 0.05). The most significant SNP was rs2889611 within MAPK8 (p = 2.70 
－5; odds ratio, 0.82; confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.90). This study demonstrates that a text mining approach combined 
× 10
with association analysis may be useful to identify the candidate genes that cause hypertension through ROS or oxidative 
stress.

Introduction

Hypertension is defined as blood pressure measurement 
consistently higher than 140 mm Hg systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) and/or 90 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure (DBP) [1]. 
It  is  a  complex  syndrome  determined  by  genetic  and  en-
vironmental factors and affected by multiple genetic factors 
to  30%  to  50%  of  blood  pressure  variability  in  human 
hypertension [2]. Although hypertension is a leading cause 
of cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke, 
the exact cause of hypertension is unclear [3].

Oxidative stress, which results in an excessive product of 
reactive oxygen species (ROS), is one of the fundamental 
mechanisms  of  the  development  of  hypertension.  In  the 
vascular system, ROS has physical and pathophysiological 
roles  that  are  important  in  vascular  remodeling  and 

endothelial dysfunction associated with hypertension [4]. 
Since 1960, when the association between free radicals and 
hypertension was reported [5], plenty of data supporting a 
role of oxidative stress in hypertension have been published. 
However, the evidence of whether oxidative stress causes 
hypertension is weak, and a few clinical studies have shown 
the relationship between blood pressure and ROS. None-
theless, oxidative stress has an important role in vascular 
biology and a potential role in hypertension.

In  this  study,  ROS-hypertension-related  genes  were 
collected by the biological literature-mining tools, such as 
SciMiner and gene2pubmed, in order to identify the genes 
that would cause hypertension through ROS. Further, single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within these gene 
regions were examined statistically for their association with 
hypertension in 6,419 Korean individuals, and pathway enri-

Methods
Study participants and genotyping

The Korea Association Resource (KARE) study recruited 
10,038 participants aged 40 years to 69 years from the rural 
Ansung and urban Ansan cohorts and has been previously 
described in detail [6]; 1,196 subjects were excluded due to 
poor genotyping data, and we also excluded subjects with 
prehypertensive status (120 mm Hg ＜ SBP ＜ 140 mm Hg 
and/or 80 mm Hg ＜ DBP ＜ 90 mm Hg). In total, 6,420 
participants－1,968  hypertensive  cases  with  hypertensive 
therapy or SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and 
4,452 controls with SBP ≤ 120 mm Hg and DBP ≤ 80 mm 
Hg－were examined for a hypertension case control study.

The  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0 
(Affymetrix,  Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA)  was  used  to 
genotype  KARE  study  individuals.  The  accuracy  of  the 
genotyping  was  examined  by  Bayesian  Robust  Linear 
Modeling using the Mahalanobis distance (BRLMM) geno-
typing algorithm [7]. The sample and SNP quality control 
criteria  have  been  described  [6].  In  brief,  samples  with 
accuracies that were lower than 98%, high missing genotype 
call rates (≥4%), high heterozygosity (＞30%), or gender 
biases were excluded. SNPs were excluded according to filter 
criteria  as  follows:  SNP  call  rate  ＞ 5%,  minor  allele 
frequency ＜ 0.01, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p ＜ 1 × 
10－6. After quality control, 8,842 individuals and 352,228 
markers remained.

Ascertaining ROS- and hypertension-related genes

The SciMiner [8] web-based literature mining tool was 
used to obtain gene sets associated with ROS and hyper-
tension. SciMiner was run on a query of “Reactive Oxygen 
Species” [MeSH] AND “Hypertension” [MeSH], identifying 
ROS-hypertension articles and genes as of April 24, 2012. 
We also retrieved genes for these ROS-hypertension articles 
from NCBI gene2pubmed (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/ 
DATA)  data.  The  newly  found  genes  from  gene2pubmed 
were added to the ROS-hypertension gene set. The positions 
of genes in the human genome were downloaded from the

Ensembl  Biomart  database  (NCBI  build  36).  Some  gene 
symbols  were  different  from  the  results  of  SciMiner  and 
Biomart, such as NOS2A → NOS2 and STN → EEF1A2. The 
functional analysis tools, such as SciMiner, WebGestalt [9, 
10], and DAVID [11, 12], were used for enrichment analysis 
to  find  the  pathway  with  ROS-hypertension-associated 
genes, and the statistical significance of biological functions 
was calculated with Benjamini and Hochberg-adjusted p ＜ 
0.05 as the cutoff.

Statistical analyses

PLINK  version  v1.07  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼
purcell/plink) was used to perform the association analysis, 
and  the  hypertension  case  control  study  was  tested  by 
logistic regression analysis. The association tests were based 
on an additive genetic model and adjusted for recruitment 
area, age, sex, and body mass index.

Results 
Ascertaining ROS and hypertension candidate genes

With  the  results  of  SciMiner,  queried  with  “‘Reactive 
Oxygen  Species’  [MeSH]  AND  ‘Hypertension’  [MeSH]”, 
574  genes  were  obtained  from  903  ROS-hypertension- 
related  articles;  49  genes  were  found  through  the  NCBI 
gene2pubmed data with these 903 papers, and only 2 genes 
out of 49 genes were new to the 574 SciMiner genes. Three 
hundred seventeen genes (55%) among the 576 ROS-hyper-
tension genes were referenced in only 1 article (Table 1) and 
were excluded for further analysis, with 259 genes remai-

ning.

Using Ensembl Biomart (NCBI Build 36), we then ex-
tracted the position information of 259 genes, and the genes 
located on chromosomes X, Y, and MT were also excluded. 
Finally, 237 genes that included SNPs genotype information 
from  KARE  data  within  the  gene  boundary  (±20  kb 
upstream and downstream of the gene) were selected, and 
2,945  SNPs  were  tested  for  hypertension  association 
analysis. The frequently mentioned genes (number of papers 
＞ 40) in the ROS-hypertension papers are shown in Table 2.

Association analysis of hypertension

We examined 2,945 SNPs of 237 genes for a hypertension 
case control study by logistic regression analysis; 68 genes 
were significantly associated with hypertension (p ＜ 0.05) 
(Table 3). The most significant SNP was rs2889611 within 
mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8; p = 2.70 × 10－5; 

odds  ratio  [OR],  0.82;  confidence  interval  [CI],  0.75  to 
0.90),  and  rs1356415  from  PROM1  and  rs4536994  from 
KDR were strongly associated with hypertension (p = 3.45 × 
10－4; OR, 1.18; CI, 1.08 to 1.29 and p = 3.73 × 10－4; OR, 
1.19; CI, 1.08 to 1.31, respectively).

Functional analysis of ROS-hypertension gene set

The 68 targets that were significantly associated with ROS 
and  hypertension  were  tested  for  functional  enrichment 
analysis.  Three  functional  analysis  tools,  SciMiner,  Web-
Gestalt, and DAVID, identified 34 significantly over-repre-
sented  biological  functions  in  the  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of 
Genes and Genomes pathway [13, 14]. The most significant 
biological pathway from the 3 functional analysis tools was 
focal adhesion, involved in the cell communication pathway 
group  (Table  4).  The  most  frequent  pathway  group  was 
cancer  pathways  (n  =  9),  such  as  glioma  and  pancreatic

Discussion 

Oxidative stress due to excess production of ROS is one of 
the  reasons  for  the  development  of  hypertension  [4].  To 
identify  genetic  risk  factors  that  induce  hypertension 
through  ROS,  this  study  extracted  ROS-hypertension-re-
lated  genes  using  text-mining  tools  and  investigated  the 
association of genes with hypertension in 6,419 unrelated 
Koreans. MAPK8, PROM1, and KDR had strong association 
signals with hypertension (p ＜ 4 × 10－4). Especially, MAPK8 
was published 13 times in ROS-hypertension articles, while 
most  genes  strongly  associated  with  hypertension  (p  ＜ 
0.01) were published an average of 6.29 times.

MAPK8, known as JNK1, included 19 SNPs in the KARE 
genotype  data,  and  14  SNPs  among  the  19  SNPs  were 
significantly  associated  with  hypertension,  ranging  in 
p-value  from  2.7  ×  10－5  to  1.3  ×  10－3－moderate  in 
comparison  with  a  genome-wide  association  study 
(GWAS)-significant p-value (5.0 × 10－8); thus MAPK8 was 
not  considered  as  the  candidate  gene  of  hypertension  in 
previous GWAS studies [15, 16]. MAPK8 plays a key role in 
T cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation through 
the  studies  of  Jnk1-deficient  mice  [17,  18].  MAPK8  was 
included  on  HumanCVD  Beadchip,  a  customized  car-
diovascular disease (CVD) SNP chip containing more than 
2,100 CVD candidate genes [19]. However, previous cardio-
vascular disease GWASs regarding high-density lipoprotein 
particle features, lipids, and apolipoproteins did not report 
the association of the MAPK8 gene [20, 21]. Therefore, it 
needs replication to make it sure whether MAPK8 is indeed 
involved in the development of hypertension through ROS.
Using  the  text-mining  tool,  we  found  237  ROS-hyper-
tension-related  genes.  The  most  frequent  gene  was  AGT 
(angiotensinogen  [serpin  peptidase  inhibitor,  clade  A, 
member 8]), which was reported on 320 ROS-hypertension 
articles, but it was not associated with hypertension in this 
study or our previous report [22]. Most of the genes that 
were published in more than 40 articles were not associated 
with  hypertension  or  showed  weak  associations;  6  of  17 
genes were significant, and the lowest p-value was 0.014 
(nitric  oxide  synthase  1  [neuronal],  NOS1).  The  average 
number of articles for genes with strong signals (p ＜ 0.01) 
was 6.29 articles, and that for those with moderate signals 
(0.01 ≤ p ＜ 0.05) was 18.90 articles.

Two large GWASs, the International Consortium for Blood 
Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies (IC-BPGWAS) 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  4,  2012

[23]  and  Asian  Genetic  Epidemiology  Network  Blood 
Pressure  (AGEN-BP)  [16],  reported  33  blood  pressure 
candidate loci in 2011. Among 66 genes within the 33 blood 
pressure candidate loci, 6 genes were included in the ROS- 
hypertension  gene  set  as  follows:  NPPA,  NPPB,  PTPN11, 
CYP1A1, GNAS, and EDN3. We examined their association 
with hypertension by case control study, and NPPA, NPPB, and 
CYP1A1 were associated with hypertension with p ＜ 0.05. The 
weakly  associated  SNP  rs1023252  (p  =  0.047)  overlapped 
with NPPA and NPPB, and rs2472299 within the CYP1A1 locus 
was previously mentioned for the oxidative stress pathway 
from WikiPathway (http://www.wikipathways.org).

In  conclusion,  we  listed  ROS-hypertension  genes  that 
were extracted by a text-mining approach and tested their 
association with hypertension in Korean population. Several 
genes, including the  MAPK8 gene, were identified  as  po-
tential genes causing hypertension through ROS. This study 
demonstrates that a text-mining approach combined with 
association  analysis  may  be  useful  to  identify  candidate 
genes  that  cause  hypertension  through  ROS  or  oxidative 
stress.
