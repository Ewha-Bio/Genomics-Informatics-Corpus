Abstract 
Background 
MicroRNAs  (miRNAs)  are  a class  of  noncoding  RNAs 
found in various organisms such as plants and mammals. 
However,  most of the mRNAs regulated by miRNAs are 
unknown.  Furthermore,  miRNA  targets  in  genomes 
cannot be identified  by standard sequence comparison 
since  their  complementarity  to  the  target  sequence  is 
irrperfect in general. In this paper, we propose a kernel-based 
method for the efficient prediction of miRNA targets. To 
help in distinguishing the false positives from  potentially 
valid  targets,  we  elucidate  the  features  common  in 
experimentally confirmed targets. 

Results 
The  performance  of  our  prediction  method  was 
evaluated  by  five-fold  cross-validation.  Our  method 
showed  0.64  and  0.98  in  sensitivity  and  in  specificity, 
respectively.  Also,  the  proposed  method  reduced  the 
number  of  false  positives  by  half  compared  with 
TargetScan. We investigated the effect of feature sets on 
the classification of miRNA targets. Finally, we predicted 
miRNA targets for several miRNAs in the Caenorhabditis 
etegans  (C.  etegans)  3'  untranslated  region  (3'  UTR) 
database. 

Condusions 
The targets predicted by the suggested method will help 
in  validating  more  miRNA  targets  and  ultimately  in 
revealing  the  role  of  small  RNAs  in  the  regulation  of 
genomes. Our algorithm for miRNA target site detection 
will  be  able to be  improved by additional  experimental(cid:173)
knowledge. Also, the increase of the number of confirmed

I ntrocluction 
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous -22 nt RNAs that 
act  as  post-transcriptional  regulators  in  animals  and 
plants  by  binding  to  the  mRNAs.  They  induce  their 
cleavages or block their translation into proteins (Bartel, 
2004). The first members of the miRNAs, lin-4 and let-7, 
were discovered in C.  etegans, and they are components 
of the gene regulatory network that controls the timing of 
C. elegans larval development (Lee eta/., 1993; Wightman 
et at., 1993; Ha et at.,  1996; Moss eta/., 1997; Seggerson 
et a/.,  2002;  Abrahante  et a/.,  2003;  Lin  et at.,  2003; 
Reinhart  et  at.,  2000).  Recently,  it  was  reported  that 
miRNAs  are  implicated  in  control  of  cell  proliferation 
(Brennecke et at., 2003), cell death for fat metabolism in 
flies  (Xu  et  at.,  2003),  control  of  leaf  and  flower 
development  in  plants  (Aukeman  et  at.,  2003;  Chen, 
2004;  Emery  et at.,  2003;  Palatnik  et  at.,  2003),  and 
hematopoietic lineage differentiation (Chen et at., 2004), 
though  no  targets  were  confirmed  in  these  studies. 
These suggest the  a broad  range of possible functions 
for  miRNAs.  The  overall  importance  of  miRNAs  has 
been  further  established  by  the  notion  that  many 
miRNAs appear to have tissue-specific or developmental 
stage-specific  expression  patterns  as  well  as  their 
evolutionary  conservation,  which  is  very  strong  within 
mammals  and  often  extends  to  invertebrate  homologs 
(Lagos-Quintana eta/., 2001; Lau eta/., 2001; Lee eta/., 
2001;  Lai,  2003;  Lim  et at.,  2003a;  Lim  et at.,  2003b; 
Pasquinelli  et  at,  2000;  Aravin  et  a/.,  2001; 
Lagos-Quintana et at.,  2002; Lagos-Quintana eta/, 2003; 
Ambros eta/., 2003;  Dostie eta/., 2003;  Houbaviy et at., 
2003;  Krichevsky eta/., 2003). 

However,  although  several  functions  of  miRNA are 
uncovered,  the  factors  and  the  mechanisms  related  to 
function  of  miRNAs  are  still  unknown.  The  functional 
annotation  of  miRNAs  is  difficult  because  the  size  of 
miRNAs  is  small  and 
the  experiments  for  target 
prediction  are  not  efficient.  Therefore,  a computational 
method to identify the target genes that are regulated by 
miRNAs would greatly help the study of miRNA function 
in animals (Ambros, 2001 ). 

Targets for plant miRNAs  have been  identified  on  a

genome-wide  scale  by  searches  which  require  a  high 
degree  of  sequence  complementarity  (Rhoades  et  a/., 
2003; Tang  eta/., 2003).  However, most animal  miRNAs 
are thought  to  recognize  their  mRNA  3'  UTR  via  partial 
complementarity (Lee eta/., 1993; Wightman eta/., 1993; 
Moss eta/., 1997; Reinhart eta/., 2000; Zeng eta/., 2002; 
Doench eta/., 2003). Because of this partial complementarity, 
simple  homology-based  searches  have failed  to  uncover 
targets for miRNAs (Ambros eta/., 2003; Bartel and Bartel, 
2003). Recently, carefully desigled computational approaches 
have been used to predict mRNA targets for Drosophila 
(Stark eta/., 2003;  Enright eta/., 2003) and mammalian 
miRNAs (Lewis eta/., 2003). 

The methods used by Lewis eta/. (2003) and Stark et 
a/.  (2003) incorporated conservation of the mRNA target 
site  in  the  related  organisms  to  separate  signal  from 
noise.  However,  the  methods  the  have  high  false 
positive rate because they rely on inferences from a free 
energy of the miRNA/target duplex folding. 

We  used  the  kernel  method  to  classify  the  mi RNA 
targets,  which  is  popular  in  modern  statistical  branch, 
particularly in probability density estimation and regression 
function  approximation.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  an 
efficient  kernel-based  method that  predicts  C.  elegans 
miRNA  targets  and  present  computational  evidences 
that the most important factor to determine miRNA targets 
is the 5'  region of miRNA. 

Methods 
Feature selection 
Experimentally validated miRNA/target duplexes contain 
mismatches, gaps, and loops at different positions. Such 
structures  of  the  duplexes  make  it  difficult  to  identify 
targets within whole-genome or transcriptome databases, 
since standard alignment methods produce many false 
positives with such short variable sequences. Furthermore, 
the small number of validated examples makes it difficult 

the correct identification of miRNA targets by traditional 
classifiers. 

In this paper, we analyzed the various characteristics 
of  miRNA/target  duplexes  to  reduce  the  false  positive 
rate and classified the features into four major categories. 
Fig.  1  presents  the  four  main  characteristics  of  the 
miRNA/target  duplexes.  First,  we  used  the  structure 
information of miRNA/target duplexes.  Even though the 
miRNA sequence has diverged, the secondary structure 
in  confirmed  miRNA/target  pairs  might  be  conserved. 
Therefore, we extracted the structural features based on 
the  characteristic  patterns  of  the  secondary  structure. 
Then,  we  calculated  the  distances  of  RNA  secondary 
structures using the RNAdistance software (Hofacker et 
a/.,  1994)  and  compared  the  similarity  of  secondary 
structure of miRNA/target duplex using a Markov Chain 
model.  Also,  we  counted  the  number  of  match  and 
mismatch sites in the miRNMarget duplexes. 

Second, we used the features of the miRNA 5' region. 
The ability of a miRNA to translationally repress a target 
mRNA is largely dictated by the free energy of binding of 
the first eight nucleotides in the 5'  region  of the miRNA 
(Doench  eta/.,  2004).  Moreover, the 5'  ends of  related 
miRNAs  tend  to  be  better conserved  than  the  3'  ends 
(Lim eta/., 2003; Mallory eta/., 2004), further supporting 
the hypothesis that these segments are most crucial for 
miRNA  target  recognition.  Therefore,  we  used  the 
structure  and  the  free  energy  data  extracted  from  the 
miRNA 5'  region/target duplexes. 

Third,  we  used  the  free  energy  of  miRNA/target 
duplexes formation. The pairing of the miRNA 5'  region 
to the  mRNA is  sufficient to cause  repression,  and the 
free  energy  value  of  this  interaction  is  an  important 
determinant of activity. The 3' region of the miRNA is less 
critical, but can modulate activity in certain circumstances 
(Doench eta/., 2004). Therefore, we calculated the free 
energy of three different parts, the free energy of miRNA/ 
mRNA duplex, miRNA 5' region/mANA duplex and miRNA 
3' region/mANA duplex.

Lastly,  we  used  the  G:U  wobble  pamng  feature 
because  G:U  wobble  pairing  is  highly  detrimental  to 
miRNA  function  despite  its  favorable  contribution  to 
RNA:RNA  duplexes  (Doench  et  at.,  2004).  Table  1 
presents all features described above. 

Secondary structure prediction of RNAIRNA 
duplexes 
Mfold  (Zuker,  2003)  is a program  package for the  RNA 
secondary  structure  prediction  using  nearest  neighbor 
thermodynamic rules.  We searched for the most stable 
binding site with RNA sequences from 3'UTR database 
using MFold. We calculated the free energy, the number 
of  G:U  wobble  pairs  and  the  number of  mismatch  and 
match through this program. 

Distance of RNA secondary structure 
We used the RNAdistance software of the Vienna RNA 
package  (Hofacker  et al., 1994)  to  calculate  distances 
between 
the  analysed  RNA  secondary  structures. 
RNAdistance  accepts  structures  in  bracket  format, 
where  matching  brackets  symbolize  base  pairs  and 
unpaired  bases  are  represented  by  a  dot  '.',  or coarse 
grained  representations  where  hairpins,  interior  loops, 
bulges,  multi  loops,  stacks  and  external  bases.  We 
calculated the distance by 

z = nl' I: RNAdistance ( str;, strquery) 

s co r e= - - - - - - - - - -

(1) 

where nP  is the number of positive training data, strquery  is 
a  query  structure,  and  stT; 
is  a  structure  of  positive 
training data.  (see the eighth feature in Table 1)

biological  structure  analysis  because  of  their  ability  to

calculated the Markov Chain probability according to the

We used the Markov Chain probability to compare a

the ninth and tenth features in Table 1) 

Kernel method for target identification 
We  used  a  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  to  classify 
miRNA  targets  from  mRNA  3'  UTR  database.  This 
method has attracted a lot of attention by its successful 
application  in  pattern  recognition  (Scholkopf  et  at., 
1999).  The  kernel  trick  used  in  SVM  is  applicable  not 
only for classification but also for other linear techniques 
(Vapnik, 1998). SVM is a method of obtaining the optimal 
boundary of two sets in a vector space independently on 
probabilistic distributions of training vectors  in the sets.

Its fundamental idea is locating the boundary that is most 
distant from the vectors nearest to the boundary in both 
of  the  sets.  Let  x  be  a  vector  in  a  vector  space.  A 
boundary  hyperplane  is  expressed  in  the  form  of 
f(x) =wtx+b  where  w  is  a weight  coefficient  vector 
and  b  is  a bias  term.  The  distance  between  a training 
vector xi  and the boundary, called margin,  is expressed 
and  reduced  as  maximization of  1/  w  2

the optimization is formalized as

The learning methods used in this study were obtained 
from the WEKA machine learning package. We used the 
SMO algorithm with the complexity parameter C = 4 and 
the polynomial kernel exponent = 5. All other parameters 
were default values. 

Results 
The framework and implementation of our method 
The overall process of our method is described in Fig.3. 
We  extracted  structural  information,  free  energy  of 
miRNA/target  site  interaction  and  8  nucleotides  (nt) 
information of miRNA 5' end as input data from negative 
and positive datasets. Then, input data was classified by 
the kernel method implemented by SVM. The computational 
experiments in this study were performed by the WEKA 
machine  learning  package  (Witten  and  Frank,  1999) 
(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/-ml/wekal). 

Datasets 
The training data for the SVM classifier is a set of RNA/RNA 
pairs  divided  into  positive  and  negative  samples.  The 
positive training set consists of 39 experimentally defined 
miRNA/target pairs (Slack eta/., 2000;  Lin  eta/., 2003; 
Banerjee eta/., 2002; Poy eta/., 2004; Stark eta/, 2003). 
The positive samples include seven pairs of /in-141 ce/-/et-7, 
three pairs of lin-14/ cel-/in-4, one pair of /in-28/ce/-/in-4, 
one  pair  of  /in-28/cel-let-7,  one  pair  of  /in-41/cel-/in-4, 
one pair of lin-41/ce/-let-7,  five  pairs of  daf-12/ce/-/et-7, 
one  pair  of  hbl/cel-/in-4,  ten  pairs  of  hb//cel-let-7,  four 
pairs of hidldme-bantam, one pair of HLHm3/dme-miR-7, 
one of hiary/dme-miR-7, one pair of rpr/dme-miR-2,  one 
pair of grirn/dme-miR-2 and one pair of Mtpn/mir-375. 

The  negative  training  set  consists  of  1022  random 
sequence/target pairs. We searched for the high-affinity

Performance of the kernel method 
The objective of this study is to construct classifiers that 
can  correctly classify the miRNA target genes from  the 
3'UTR database.  The  performance of  our classification 
method was evaluated by five-fold cross-validation. That 
is,  the whole data set was partitioned into five subsets. 
The four of the subsets were used as a training test, and 
the  rest  were  used as a test set,  and this  process was 
repeated five times. Table 2 shows the sensitivity and the 
specificity of the five-fold  cross-validation  in  classifying 
the miRNA target genes using the kernel  machine. The 
sensitivity was 0.64 and the specificity was 0.98. 

Also,  we  compared  the  performance to  TargetScan 
(Lewis eta/., 2003) with 32 of 39 training data and 1751 
random negative data. TargetScan corrbines thermodynarrics(cid:173)
based  modelling  of  RNA/RNA duplex  interactions  with 
comparative sequence analysis to predict miRNA targets

the  sensitivity  and  the  specificity  of  our  method  using 
SVM are similar to or better than TargetScan program. 
However, the more important thing is that the number of 
false positives is much lower than TargetScan, that is, 35 
false  positives  by  our  method  compared  with  77  in 
TargetScan. This shows that our method is more efficient 
and correct than TargetScan. 

MiaoRNA target prediction in C. elegans 
We applied our method to let-land lin-4 miRNA genes, 

whose targets are known  (Wightman eta/.,  1993; Ha et 
a/., 1996; Moss eta/., 1997; Olsen eta/., 1999; Seggerson 
eta/., 2002; Slack eta/., 2000; Abrahante eta/., 2003; Lin 
eta/.,  2003;  Banerjee  eta/.,  2002)  (Tables  3  and  4). 
These  predicted  miRNA targets  contain  all  the  known 
let-7targets:  /in-41,  daf-21,  /in-14,  hbl and  lin-28.  This 
shows  that  most  miRNAitarget  pairs  can  possibly  be 
detected  by  an  SVM  classifier  with  low  specificity  in 
genome-wide  searches.  Table  5  presents  the  miRNA 
targets of miR-228, miR-229, miR-230 and miR-231. 

Analysis of Feature Set 
In this section, we investigate the effect of feature set on 
the performance of miRNA target classifier. We excluded 
a  feature  from  the  entire  feature  set  one  by  one  and 
examined  how  much  each  feature  contributes  to  the 
performance  of  the  classifier.  Fig.  6  presents  each 
feature's  influence  on  the  performance.  The  feature 
having lower sensitivity will be a more important factor to 
decide miRNA targets. The top-three features having the 
lowest sensitivity were the number of G/U wobble pairs 
at the 8 nt of miRNA 5' region (feature (4)), the number of 
matches at the 8 nt of miRNA 5' region (feature (1)), and 
the similarity of secondary structure of miRNA 5'  region 
/mRNA  duplex  using  a  Markov  chain  model  (feature 
(10)).  All  of them  are  related  to the  miRNA 5'  region. 
Every experiment  has  a similar specificity (97%  - 98%). 
Moreover, Fig. 7 shows that features the miRNA 5' region 
are  the  most  important  information  to  decide  whether 
miRNA target or not,  further supporting the  hypothesis

Fig. 6. Feature's influence on performance. 
The x-axis means the feature number of Table 1. Each SVM classifier 
is trained without the feature ofthe corresponding number. The feature 
with lower sensitivity is assumed to be a more important factor in the 
identification of miRNA target. 

Fig. 7. Feature's influence on performance. (1) SVM classifier 
trained  without  information  about  free  energy.  (2)  SVM 
classifier trained without RNA structure information.  (3)  SVM 
classifier trained without information of miRNA 5' region. This 
shows  that  features  about  miRNA  5'  region  are  the  most 
important information to decide whether miRNA target or not. 

Identification of Caenorhabditis elegans MicroRNA Targets Using a Kernel  Method  21 

that the miRNA 5' region is most critical for miRNA target 
recognition (Doench eta/., 2004). 

Discussion 
The  application  of  a  computational  approach  to  the 
prediction  of  miRNA  targets  is  often  hindered  by  the 
small  size  of  miRNA  sequences.  The  prediction  of 
mi~NA targets is more complicated due to the tendency 
of  Imperfectness  in  miRNA/mRNA pairings  in  animals. 
We  presented  a  kernel-based  classification  method  to 
o~ercome these problems and tried to identify potential 
miRNA  targets  with  an  RNA-folding  program  that 
evaluates ~he structural  and thermodynamic plausibility 
of the predicted pairs and distinguishes the real from the 
random  matches.  Kernel-based  statistical 
learning 
methods have a number of advantages for the analysis 
of not only vectorial  and matrix data which are common 
in  classic statistical  analysis  but also  more  exotic data 
types  such  as  string,  trees  and  graphs.  The  ability  to 
handl~ such  data  is  clearly  essential  in  the  biological 
doma1n.  The  kernel-based  method  provides  significant 
opportunities  for  the  incorporation  of  more  specific 
biological knowledge and unlabelled data. 

We  demonstrated  that  the  SVM  classifier  for  the 
computational  identification  of  miRNA  target  sites  can 
dete~t miRNA target sites with high specificity. The result 
of th1s method will be able to provide better understanding 
of how miRNAs bind their targets. To help distinguish the 
false positives from potentially valid targets, we identify 
the  features  shared  by valid  targets.  Also,  the  method 
can be ~pplied to other species as well, because many of 
these m~RNA~ are phylogenetically conserved, suggesting 
strong evolutionary pressure. The functional target sites 
are conserved in homologous genes from related species 
(IVIoss and Tang, 2003), so we can improve the performance 
through the analysis of the orthologous 3'UTRs. Efforts to 
find  more  animal  miRNA targets  will  be  greatly  helpful 
because of the deeper understanding  of  structural  and 
bioc~emical nature of miRNA/mRNA pairing. The targets 
pred1ct~d by the proposed method will help in validating 
more miRNA targets and ultimately in revealing the role 
of these small RNAs in the regulation of the genome.
