During recent years, there has been exponential growth in biological information. With the emergence of large datasets in 
biology,  life  scientists  are  encountering  bottlenecks  in  handling  the  biological  data.  This  study  presents  an  integrated 
geographic information system (GIS)-ontology application for handling microbial genome data. The application uses a linear 
referencing technique as one of the GIS functionalities to represent genes as linear events on the genome layer, where users 
can define/change the attributes of genes in an event table and interactively see the gene events on a genome layer. Our 
application adopted ontology to portray and store genomic data in a semantic framework, which facilitates data-sharing 
among biology domains, applications, and experts. The application was developed in two steps. In the first step, the genome 
annotated data were prepared and stored in a MySQL database. The second step involved the connection of the database to 
both ArcGIS and Protégé as the GIS engine and ontology platform, respectively. We have designed this application specifically 
to manage the genome-annotated data of rumen microbial populations. Such a GIS-ontology application offers powerful 
capabilities for visualizing, managing, reusing, sharing, and querying genome-related data.

Introduction

The  advances  in  genomics  technologies  and  other 
molecular research, together with recent developments in 
information technologies, have generated a great quantity of 
data  in  the  molecular  biology  domain  [1].  For  example, 
GenBank, as a comprehensive and well-known database of 
National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI, 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)  online  resources,  holds 
nucleotide sequences for more than 280,000 species that are 
available to the public [2]. Another example of large biological 
datasets  is  the  2013  edition  of  the  annual  Nucleic  Acids 
Research database issue, which currently lists 1,512 databases, 
organized into 14 categories and 41 subcategories, available at 
http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/ [3]. 

Among  organisms,  rumen  microbes  have  not  been  an 
exception  to  these  debates.  But,  much  less  attention  has 
been paid to integrate and manage the genomic data related 

to  these  microorganisms.  Molecular  research  on  ruminal 
microbes has gained attention as more genomic sequences 
and related genomic data are becoming available to scientific 
communities. The primary focus of this study was to develop 
an application that allows users to interactively manage the 
genome-annotated data of rumen microbial consortia. The 
rumen environment is the main part of the digestive system 
and consists of a complex microbial community that makes 
the  rumen  microbial  ecosystem  [4].  This  ecosystem  is  a 
natural  habitat  that  houses  a  wide  spectrum  of  bacteria, 
protozoa, anaerobic fungi, and bacteriophages [5]. By having 
a  symbiotic  mutualistic  relationship  with  ruminants,  the 
microbes are capable of converting feed components into a 
source of energy for the animals (i.e., volatile fatty acids). 
Ruminants are able to utilize a variety of feeds owing to an 
extremely  diversified  rumen  microbial  ecosystem  [4]. 
According  to  previous  molecular  studies,  it  has  been 
reported that the population of rumen bacteria accounts for 
at least 300 to 400 phylotypes [6-8].

There  is  no  doubt  that  progress  in  biological  research 
could not be achieved without equivalent efforts in informatics 
research. Since data management and analysis are facing new 
challenges in parallel with the age of big data, many research 
activities have been conducted for handling the biological 
data. There are several special issues that reflect the ever 
increasing importance of data management approaches in 
biology [9-13]. 

Geographic information system (GIS) is a computer-based 
system designed for displaying, storing, manipulating, and 
analyzing geographical data [14]. As an analytical system, 
GIS can serve biological systems by establishing biological 
databases,  with  the  use  of  powerful  representation  and 
display tools, as well as providing query and analysis tools. 
An example of a GIS query is finding all hospitals that are 
equipped with an advanced technology, located in the city 
center, and with more than 500 beds. A number of GIS-based 
approaches have been used to handle biological information. 
A  typical  example  in  the  biology  domain  is  discussed  by 
Kozak et al. [15], in which they applied GIS technologies and 
concepts for evolutionary biology. Their study uses the GIS 
to track macroevolutionary changes among species and the 
evolutionary process of geographic variation within species. 
In previous studies of GIS applications in genomics, a major 
effort was made by Dolan et al. [16]. They presented a GIS 
application,  called  Genome  Spatial  Information  System 
(GenoSIS), to manage and represent genomic information. 
Ontology is about terminology (domain vocabulary), all 
essential concepts in a domain, their classification, taxonomy, 
relations (including all important hierarchies and constraints), 
and domain axioms [17]. It represents the particular meanings 
of concepts by specifying the concepts and their relationships. 
The use of ontology enables one to structure biological data 
(genome/gene  data)  in  a  machine-understandable  form  by 
defining biological concepts, relationships, and instances in a 
semantic structure.

This paper presents an integrated GIS-ontology application 
for the management of microbial genome data. The main 
rationale behind integrating GIS and ontology is that these 
two distinct areas of research can complement each other for 
biological applications. While the GIS is commonly recognized 
as a powerful and integrated tool with unique capabilities for 
storing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geographical 
information, ontology provides a rich collection of procedures 
and algorithms to meaningfully share and exchange data. 
Our application is implemented by using ArcGIS and Protégé 
to couple GIS-based biological applications with ontology. The 
genome-annotated  data  of  rumen  microbial  flora  were 
adopted to evaluate the performance of the application. The 
system can be extended and employed for handling other 
types of genomic data. 

Methods

More specifically, this study adopts the functionality of 
linear referencing (LR) for representing genome-annotated 
data in a GIS environment. Our application uses ontology to 
semantically organize and reason the data in a semantic and 
machine-understandable framework. In this application, we 
defined a measurement unit for genomes, so that one meter 
was assigned per nucleotide. The users have the flexibility to 
interact with the genome as a layer or with different genomes 
as  a  collection  of  layers.  The  ArcGIS  platform  of  the 
application supports users with interactive genomic maps 
and implementation of special queries. 

Linear referencing

LR  is  one  of  the  GIS  tools  representing  geographic 
locations  of  linear  events  based  on  relative  positions  on 
linear  features [18],  where the  beginning  and  end of  the 
events are recorded as measurement values in event tables. 
Using  LR,  attributes  are  linearly  referenced  and  linked 
dynamically to layers (e.g., the genome). This technique can 
be effectively used to represent genomes and genes as layers 
and linear events, respectively. By applying this technique, 
the  genomic  data  initially  stored  in  event  tables  can  be 
visualized, displayed, queried, and analyzed on the genome 
network. The LR method provides flexibility to split a linear 
genome into new sets of gene segments (i.e., line events), 
without having to draw a new line layer for gene events. As 
presented in Fig. 1, the LR process includes the fields of 
location  and  attribute(s)  associated  with  gene  events.  As 
shown, the line gene events are related to the genome layers 
through the values of the field “Genome-ID.” The location of 
line events (genes) on a given genome layer is indicated in 
the fields “Start” and “End.” In other words, a line event uses 
both “Start” and “End” measure values to describe a portion 
(i.e., a gene) of a genome.

Ontology 

From a computer science perspective, ontology is defined 
as the structure representing a shared, formal, and explicit 
specification  of  knowledge  in  a  particular  domain  (e.g., 
biology).  Hendler  [19]  describes  ontology  as  a  set  of 
knowledge  terms,  containing  the  terminology  (domain 
vocabulary),  all  essential  concepts  in  the  domain,  the 
semantic  interconnections,  and  simple  rules  of  logic  and 
inference for some particular topics. A typical example of an 
ontology approach in biology is using standard concepts to 
classify  microorganisms.  There  are  a  large  number  of 
identified microbes in nature, so that this amount has long 
stimulated interest to establish an anthological classification 
for them. Gene Ontology (GO) is another example of an

ontology application in biology. GO is intended to formulize 
biological  knowledge  in  orthogonal  hierarchies  [20].  It 
includes controlled vocabularies that are described for gene 
products with respect to their biological processes, cellular 
components, and molecular functions [21]. Ontology speci-
fication languages are knowledge representation languages 
used to encode ontologies in a formal (machine-readable and 
-processable) and standard format. The most common and 
popular ontology language is OWL from the World Wide 
Web  Consortium  (W3C).  OWL  concepts/classes  (e.g., 
genome, gene, etc.) are created using formal specifications 
that an individual object/instance (e.g., genome and gene 
instances) needs to satisfy to belong to a particular class. The 
individuals  that  share  similar  characteristics  would  be 
members of the same concept. 

Implementation

As depicted in Fig. 2, the ontology-based GIS application 
was implemented using a combination of the two platforms 
of ArcGIS [22] and Protégé [23] and MySQL as a database 
management  system.  ArcGIS  is  a  commercial  software 
package containing a set of integrated applications, such as 
ArcMap  and  ArcCatalog.  ArcMap  is  the  main  mapping 
application allowing users to generate maps, query attributes, 
analyze spatial relationships, and lay out final projects. The 
ArcCatalog application allows users to manage geographic 
data [24]. 

Several programs have been developed to edit and view 
ontologies, such as Ontolingua and Protégé. Both Ontolingua 
and Protégé are capable of generating a separate frame for 
every knowledge item that covers the information, such as 
definitions, links, and relationships [20]. In the proposed 
application, we applied the Protégé software as an ontolo-

data.

gy-developing environment. Protégé is a free and open-source 
platform that provides a set of tools for constructing domain 
ontologies and knowledge-based applications. We constructed 
the  rumen  microbial  genome  ontology  to  organize  geno-
me-related data, including classes (e.g., microbial genomes 
found  in  rumen  and  their  associated  genes)  and  their 
relationships/properties (e.g., gene name, product, catalyzed 
reaction,  and  accession  number  of  a  gene).  In  order  to 
implement the system, we applied the genome-annotated 
data of several ruminal microbes deposited in NCBI.

In the first phase of implementation, the genome-annotated 
data were stored in a MySQL database using Navicat software 
(Fig.  3).  Navicat,  as  a  powerful  solution  for  MySQL 
administration,  offers  a  graphical  interface  for  managing 
databases (http://navicat.com/). The second phase involved 
the connection of the database to both ArcGIS and Protégé as

the  GIS  engine  and  ontology  platform,  respectively.  The 
database  was  connected  to  the  ArcCatalog  application  of 
ArcGIS. The genome layers were created as shapefiles via 
ArcCatalog and displayed in an ArcMap environment (Fig. 4). 
As shown in Fig. 5, the DataMaster plugin of Protégé was 
integrated with a MySQL database through a JDBC driver. 
DataMaster is a plugin for Protégé editor that allows the 
conversion  of  a  relational  database  into  an  RDF  model 
(resource descriptive framework) that can be processed and 
understood by machines [25]. After integrating DataMaster 
with  the  MySQL  database,  each  of  the  tables  from  the 
database was imported into Protégé as an OWL class, along 
with its instances and properties.

Results 

One of the advantages of a GIS application in the genomic 
area is that users can easily query and analyze genome-related 
data. In addition, the users are able to select locations on a 
genome map and display their records in the attribute table. 
GIS has a special functionality to support users with simple 
and complex queries for the data represented in each layer. 
As shown in Fig. 6, complicated queries were made based on 
the attributes of genomic data and a given gene location. Fig. 
6 presents two query examples: one is for a special gene 
product  (phosphoglucosamine  mutase)  in  the  annotated 
genome of Streptococcus bovis, and another is a query based on 
a specific accession number belonging to the gene (genes). 
The results of both query examples are presented on the 
genome, such that they are highlighted with a red rectangle 
on  the  genome  layer.  ArcGIS  allows  one  to  use  “Identify 
tool.”  Applying  this  tool  allows  users  to  be  able  to  have 
information about a gene displayed in ArcMap. It has been 
used as the fastest way to find out the characteristics of a 
location on a map. On the gene event layer, users are able to 
identify genes by clicking on a particular location (Fig. 7). 
This will present the attribute data of the selected location. 

The genome ontology of ruminal microbes was developed 
using OWL/RDF language in the Protégé environment. Fig. 8 
shows a screenshot of Protégé’s class tab, indicated by a red 
rectangle. Via this tab, classes, along with their subclasses 
for the ontology, are displayed in the blue rectangle, and all 
instances and their attributes are shown in yellow and green 
rectangles, respectively. Additional tabs for object properties 
and data type properties are available in the editor, which has 
the same view as the class tab.

In  conclusion,  the  proposed  application  provides  users 
with  the  ability  to  manage  genomic  data  related  to  the 
microbial community of the rumen. This application will be 
particularly  helpful  to  researchers  and  experts  who  are 
working  in  fields,  such  as  biology,  animal  sciences,  and 
genomics. Two central aspects of designing and using such 
an interactive application are data querying and data sharing. 
The application allows users (1) to access, visualize, store, 
query, and analyze the genomic data and (2) to share such 
data among biology users and applications by providing a 
semantic structure of data. The data stored in the ontology is 
machine-processable  and  can  be  shared  and  reused  by 
biology applications. 

Discussion

With  the  emergence  of  large  datasets  in  biology,  life 
scientists are encountering bottlenecks in handling biological 
data. The increase of genomic data caused by next-generation 
sequencing technologies is leading to a continuous decrease 
in the effectiveness of conventional genomic browsers [26]. 
Most genomic browsers are principally used for visualizing 
the  genomic  features  and  a  user’s  genomic  data  [26].  In 
order  to  visualize  genomic  features,  different  genomic 
browsers are available on the web, such as Ensembl [27] and 
University  of  California,  Santa  Cruz  (UCSC)  [28].  Some 
genomic browsers represent gene annotations as horizontal 
data  tracks.  For  example,  the  UCSC  genomic  browser

represents annotations as a series of horizontal tracks over 
the genomic sequence. In this browser, each track presents a 
specific  type  of  annotation  [28].    In  comparison  to  the 
paradigm  of  horizontal  data  tracks  applied  by  genomic 
browsers,  the  GIS  application  uses  the  concepts  of  a  LR 
technique to present genomes in a dynamic manner, where 
users can define/change attributes of genes in a table and 
interactively  see  the  gene  events  on  genome  layers.  A 
previous  study  of  a  GIS  application  in  genomic  data 

management  employed  the  concepts  and  tools  that  were 
defined  for  displaying  the  geographic  data  to  develop 
GenoSIS.  GenoSIS  was  proposed  to  spatially  represent 
genomes  and  interact  with  genome-related  attribute  data 
[16]. However, this system is based on a fixed linear data 
model, which presents the genome as a linear feature with 
associated attributes. The system is fixed in the sense that 
defining new or changing gene attributes requires users to 
graphically  draw  new  lines  and  change  the  GIS  file  (i.e.,

genome  shapefile  and  geodatabase  file).  Moreover,  this 
system lacks the ability to semantically represent genome- 
related information, where information can meaningfully be 
interpreted by software agents and can be shared between 
different biological applications. One of the most interesting 

capabilities of GIS compared to existing genomic browsers is 
its ability to make complex attribute and spatial queries. A 
GIS query is a user-defined request that examines genome/gene 
layer or tabular attributes based on user-selected criteria and 
displays  only  those  features  or  records  that  satisfy  the

criteria. The proposed application has the potential to store, 
represent, visualize, and analyze genome-annotated data in a 
dynamic  manner.  In  addition,  our  application  adopted 
ontology to organize genomic data in a semantic framework, 
which  facilitates  data  sharing  among  biology  domains, 
applications, and experts. During recent years, there have 
been many web-based developments that use ontology as 
their knowledge base, such as GO [21], Plant Ontology [29], 
and Microbial Ontology [30], etc. Ontologies define domain 
concepts and the relationships between them and therefore 

provide  a  domain  language  that  is  meaningful  to  both 
machines and humans [30]. In the present study, we used 
Protégé,  which  contains  a  query  interface  known  as  the 
SPARQL query panel, through which users are able to query 
particular information from the ontology [30]. 

However, the proposed application in this study is subject 
to  some  limitations.  One  of  the  limitations  is  that  the 
application is not able to represent all genomic data (e.g., 
sequences) and can not make a query on several genome 
event layers simultaneously. Another limitation is related to 

www.genominfo.org

13

S Jelokhani-Niaraki,  et  al.  Ontology-Based GIS for Genomic Data Management

the lack of powerful inference engines to reason genomic 
data  for  the  purpose  of  data  sharing.  Effective  inference 
engines  are  required  to  semantically  interpret  data  and 
exchange them with their intended meanings. One source of 
limitation is also related to the fact that the application is 
available on desktop; future research is required to develop 
an  online  version  of  the  application  and  a  data  server 
consisting  of  microbial  genome  databases  for  browsing 
genome-annotated data.

Our work continues toward future plans, including the 
extension of this application to develop an ontology-based 
GIS interactive database for rumen microbial communities. 
Effort is already under way for developing such a comprehensive 
database  to  contain  a  wide  spectrum  of  rumen  microbial 
genomes.
