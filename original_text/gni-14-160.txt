Over  the  past  decade,  the  detection  of  gene-gene  interactions  has  become  more  and  more  popular  in  the  field  of 
genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The goal of the GWAS is to identify genetic susceptibility to complex diseases by 
assaying and analyzing hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. However, such tests are computationally 
demanding and methodologically challenging. Recently, a simple but powerful method, named “BOolean Operation-based 
Screening and Testing” (BOOST), was proposed for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analyses. BOOST was designed with 
a Boolean representation of genotype data and is approximately equivalent to the log-linear model. It is extremely fast, and 
genome-wide gene-gene interaction analyses can be completed within a few hours. However, BOOST can not adjust for 
covariate  effects,  and  its  type-1  error  control  is  not  correct.  Thus,  we  considered  two-step  approaches  for  gene-gene 
interaction analyses. First, we selected gene-gene interactions with BOOST and applied logistic regression with covariate 
adjustments to select gene-gene interactions. We applied the two-step approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Korea 
Association Resource (KARE) cohort and identified some promising pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with 
T2D.

Introduction

The concept of epistasis, generally defined as interactions 
among  different  genes,  was  first  introduced  in  1909  by 
William Bateson to describe the latent effect of one locus 
over  another  locus.  A  quantitative  definition  to  the  inte-
raction was proposed in 1918 by R.A. Fisher as a statistical 
deviation  from  the  additive  effects  of  two  loci  on  a  phe-
notype.  This  definition  enabled  interaction  analyses  by 
testing whether products of multiple genotypes are stati-
stically associated with phenotypes. More definitions about 
the gene-gene interaction have been proposed, but some are 
still not clearly understood. The statistical gene-gene intera-
ction has often been confused with a biological gene-gene 
interaction. Particularly, the inference on a biological mech-
anism  is  complicated  because  of  the  lack  of  direct  corre-
spondence  between  statistical  and  biological  interactions 
[1]. In general, statisticians define a statistical interaction as 

a departure from additivity in a linear model using a selected 
measurement scale [2]. However, as was pointed by Wang et 
al. [3], if one aims to infer biological interactions, statisti-
cally modeled interactions and main effect terms should not 
be  interpreted  separately  [2].  In  this  paper,  we  detected 
gene-gene interactions with a likelihood ratio test. Genotype 
scores for single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pairs were 
considered nominal variables, and nine different levels were 
assumed  for  a  full  model.  For  a  reduced  model,  we  con-
sidered three levels for each SNP, and thus, our likelihood 
ratio tests followed a chi-square distribution with 4 degrees 
of  freedom.  Therefore,  the  proposed  method  can  detect 
biological  interactions.  It  should  be  noted  that  biological 
interactions include statistical interactions. 

The  method  of  detecting  gene-gene  interactions  has 
attracted  much  attention  in  genome-wide  association 
studies (GWASs). Including logistic regression analysis for 
detecting gene-gene interactions, new methods, like com-
paring  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  in  case  and  control

groups, have been recently proposed [4]. However, analyzing 
a large number of SNPs in a GWAS is computationally very 
intensive,  and  various  approaches,  such  as  MDR  [5], 
BEAM [6], Random Jungle [7], PLINK [8], and BOolean 
Operation-based Screening and Testing (BOOST), have been 
proposed to enable gene-gene interactions on a genome-wide 
scale.

In this paper, we considered BOOST method, proposed by 
Wan  et  al.  [9].  BOOST  uses  a  non-iteratively  estimated 
measure  that  is  approximately  equal  to  the  maximum 
likelihood estimators for a log-linear model, and it is used to 
select pairs of SNPs with a specified threshold. There is an 
updated  method,  graphical  processing  units  BOOST 
(GBOOST), which is a BOOST method implemented for a 
graphical processing units framework for enabling parallel 
computing to achieve massive assignment in a fast manner 
[10]. GBOOST achieves a 40-fold speedup compared with 
BOOST.  However,  in  the  algorithm  of  BOOST,  covariates 
other than SNPs can not be considered. We need a more 
flexible approach to improve the power of the model. 

Here, we propose an efficient strategy that combines the 
BOOST  screening  stage  and  logistic  regression  method. 
Logistic regression generally shows good statistical power 
for a wide spectrum of epistasis. Screening with BOOST is a 
computationally efficient screening method, and a genome- 
wide  search  can  be  completed  within  a  few  hours.  A 
follow-up stage of logistic regression with covariates would 
improve the statistical power of the model. In this paper, we 
first  review  the  BOOST  method  and  apply  the  proposed 
two-stage approach to type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Korean 
population.  This  analysis  of  gene-gene  interactions  on  a 
genome-wide scale with BOOST was completed within 42 
hours, and we also identified several pairs of SNPs associated 
with T2D.

T2D is the most common form of diabetes, and unlike 
people  with  type  1  diabetes,  T2D  patients  make  insulin. 
However,  either  their  pancreas  does  not  make  enough 
insulin or the body cannot use the insulin well enough. The 
prevalence of T2D has increased rapidly in recent years. The 
prevalence of T2D in Korea was estimated to be 7.3% (in 
people over 20 years of age) in 2005, and the rate of patients 
with T2D is expected to increase dramatically from 7.08% in 
2010 to about 10.85% by 2030 [11]. Even more and more 
children  are  being  diagnosed  with  T2D.  Environmental 
effects, like obesity and lack of physical activity, are two of 
the most common causes of T2D, and the increasing pre-
valence may be related with them. It is also known that T2D 
has  considerable  heritability,  which  indicates  a  genetic 
effect. Until now, genetic variants in nearly 70 loci have been 
identified  for  T2D.  Some  variants  from  genes,  such  as 
KCNQ1  [12],  KCNJ11,  PPARG,  NRF1,  IDE,  TCF7L2,

CDKAL1,  HHEX,  IGF2BP2,  CDKN2A/B,  and  SLC30A8 
[13], were reported as significant susceptible genes to T2D 
in the East Asian population. To detect the relation between 
gene-gene interactions and T2D phenotype, we performed a 
gene-gene interaction analysis with the proposed two-stage 
analysis. We analyzed 8,842 participants (4,183 males and 
4,659 females) with 352,228 autosomal SNPs collected from 
the Korea Association Resource project (KARE). We found 
some promising gene-gene interactions with the proposed 
method, and they will be investigated further in our future 
follow-up studies.

Methods
The KARE cohort

The KARE project started in 2007 and recruited 10,000 
participants aged between 49 to 60 years from Ansung and 
Ansan, in the Gyeonggi Province of South Korea. About 50 
million  autosomal  SNPs  were  genotyped  with  the  Affy-
metrix Genome-Wide Human SNP arrary 5.0 [14]. In total, 
8,842 individuals with 352,228 SNPs are available. In our 
GWASs, we discarded SNPs for which the Hardy-Weinberg 
–5,  the  genotype 
equilibrium  p-values  were  less  than  10
calling  rates  were  less  than  95%,  and  the  minor  allele 
frequencies were less than 0.05. We also eliminated subjects 
with gender inconsistencies, those whose identity by state 
was more than 0.8, and those whose calling rates were less 
than 95%. As a result, we analyzed 8,773 participants (4,117 
males and 4,656 females) with 304,245 SNPs. 

Definition of T2D 

An individual was coded as a T2D patient if the condition 
satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) diabetes 
diagnostic  criteria:  fasting  plasma  glucose  (glu0)  ≥ 126 
mg/dL, plasma glucose (glu120) ≥ 200 mg/dL 2 h after an 
oral dose, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%. A total 
of 1,169 subjects were diagnosed as cases, and the other 
individuals were considered controls.

Notations

We assume that there are L SNPs and n subjects. Geno-
types at SNP l are denoted by Xl, where l = 1, …, L, and Y 
indicates the disease status: 1 for case and 2 for control. We 
assume that SNPs are bi-allelic, and capital and lowercase 
letters  always  indicate  the  major  and  minor  alleles,  res-
pectively.  For  instance,  AA  indicates  a  homozygous  refe-
rence  genotype,  Aa  indicates  the  heterozygous  genotype, 
and  aa  indicates  the  homozygous  variant  genotype.  For 
simplicity, we denote the homozygous reference genotype, 
heterozygous genotype, and homozygous variant genotype 
as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The logistic regression model with only a main effect for 
two SNPs, p and q, can be modeled by the following form:

We  denote  it  log-likelihood  value  by  LF.  Then,  the  in-
teraction  effects  can  be  detected  by  the  difference  of  the 
maximum log-likelihoods (MLEs) of these two models—i.e., 
 .

However, the difference in the log-likelihood needs very 
intensive computation for hundreds of billions of pairs of 
SNPs. Alternatively, there exists a one-to-one correspondence 
between a logistic regression model and a log-linear model in 
categorical data analysis [15], and BOOST considers inte-
raction models based on log-linear models [9].

On the basis of the equivalence between the log-linear 
model  and  its  corresponding  logistic  regression  model, 
BOOST  constructed  its  test  statistic  using  the  homo-
geneous association model MH and saturated model MS and 
denotes  their  log-likelihood  as  LH  and  LS,  respectively. 
Then, we denote the observed genotype count of disease 
status k with Xp = i and Xq = j by nijk and the expected 
genotype count by μijk, where k = 1 or 2, i = 1, 2, or 3, and 
j = 1, 2, or 3. Then, the maximum log-likelihood of both 
models will be

This provides another interpretation of interactions, in that 
the difference of two log-likelihoods is proportional to the 
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the joint distribution obtained 
under the saturated model MS and the distribution obtained 
under homogeneous association model MH.

In particular, there is no closed form solution for homo-
genous  association  model  MH,  and  iterative  methods  are 
needed  to  calculate  the  likelihood  ratio  tests.  Likelihood 
ratio tests are computationally intensive when facing hund-
reds of billions of SNP pairs in the interaction analysis.

To address this issue, BOOST uses Kirkwood superposition 

approximation (KSA) [16] to estimate under MH as

Therefore, it can be utilized to approximate LH. If we let 
LKSA be the likelihood based on KSA, then we get following 
equation:

30, and its corresponding p-value is 4.89 × 10

non-significant  SNP  pairs  would  be  filtered  out  in  this 
manner in the screening stage.

Two-stage gene-gene interaction analyses 

We  first  apply  the  BOOST  approach  to  select  the  pro-
mising pairs of SNPs with the a priori chosen τ. τ can be 
selected based on the available computing facility, and we set 
τ = 30 for our analyses. After filtering SNP pairs from the

first  stage  with  BOOST,  we  apply  the  logistic  regression. 
BOOST can not adjust for the effects of covariates, and we 
applied logistic regression analysis with adjustments for sex, 
age,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  and  the  top  10  principal 
component (PC) scores to the selected pairs of SNPs with 
BOOST. The logistic regression analysis was performed by 
using  the  glm  function  in  R  software.  To  calculate  the 
p-values  of  the  interaction  term,  we  used  the  ANOVA 
function by comparing two fitted models in R.

Results

We have carried out an interaction analysis on T2D in the 
KARE cohort on the genome-wide scale; 8,773 subjects with 
304,245  SNPs  were  considered  for  detecting  gene-gene 
interactions. Missing genotypes were imputed with Impute2 
[17] software. 

We applied the proposed two-stage approach to identify 
the  genome-wide  significant  gene-gene  interactions.  The 
analyses  were  completed  within  42  h  with  an  Intel  Core 
i3-4130 CPU 3.40 GHz desktop. A total of 46,282,357,890 
interactions  were  executed,  and  the  Bonferroni-adjusted 
0.05 genome-wide significance level is 1.08e-12. Promising 
pairs of SNPs were selected with BOOST, and 229,965 pairs 
of SNPs were selected with BOOST; then 229,965 pairs of 
SNPs were analyzed with logistic regression. 

To perform adjustments for the population substructure 
between individuals, we used the EIGENSTRAT [18] method. 
EIGENSTRAT  calculates  the  genetic  similarities  among 
subjects by using a genetic relationship matrix and applies 
PC analysis. The generated PC scores are then utilized as 
covariates for genetic association analyses, and this approach 
guarantees  robustness  against  a  population  substructure. 
Here, we calculated the first 10 PC scores, and they were

included as covariates for the logistic method in R. Sex, age, 
and BMI were also included as covariates in the analysis.

Most  significant  results  for  interaction  analyses  with 
KARE datasets are listed in Table 1. Only the top 10 sig-
nificant SNP pairs are listed. The most significant interaction 
effect with a p-value of 3.11E-11 was found for rs1402142 
and  rs8012584.  The  former  is  associated  with  the  genes 
HTRA3, AREG, TEC, and NRAS (Table 2), which are related 
to metabolic, immune, and hematological diseases, and the 
latter is associated with the genes ANG and ABCB1, related 
to neurological and metabolic diseases. Our results show 
that even the interactions are significant, but their marginal 
effects may not be. There are some interesting results that 
rs872234  is  near  DHFRP2,  which  is  related  to  diabetes 
mellitus type 1 [19], and rs1110144 and rs1104853 are both 
in CNTNAP2 [20] and MIR548T, respectively; they are also 
known to be associated with diabetes.

Discussion

The analysis of gene-gene interactions on a genome-wide 
scale is computationally very intensive, and many compu-
tational and statistical approaches have been recently pro-
posed to minimize the computational burden. We found that 
BOOST is highly computationally efficient and can filter out 
non-significant interaction pairs in a fast manner. 

In this study, we proposed an efficient strategy to identify 
interactions in genome-wide SNP data. We first utilized the 
screening stage of BOOST to filter out non-significant pairs 
and  then  used  logistic  regression  with  several  covariates, 
such as age, sex, BMI, and PC scores.

In real data analysis, we used the KARE cohort dataset to 
detect gene-gene interactions of T2D. The smallest p-value 
(3.11E-11) of interaction pairs in the KARE data was found 
for  rs1402142  and  rs8012584.  The  Bonferroni-adjusted 
genome-wide significance level is 1.08e-12, and this SNP 
pair is not significant genome-wide. This insignificance is 
partially attributable to the insufficient sample size. With 
advances in genotyping/sequencing technology, genotyping 
costs will be much lower, and therefore, in the near future, 
sufficiently  large  samples  will  become  available  for  gene- 
gene  interaction  analyses,  which  may  lead  us  to  a  better 
understanding of human diseases.
