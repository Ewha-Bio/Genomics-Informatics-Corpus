Abstract 
The  epidermis  is  a  physiological  barrier  to  protect 
organisms  against  environment.  During 
the  aging 
process, skin tissues undergo various changes including 
morphological and functional changes. The transcriptional 
regulation  of genes is  part of cellular  reaction  of aging 
process.  In  order  to  examine  the  changes  of  gene 
expression  during  the  aging  process,  we  used  the 
primary  cell  culture  system  of  human  keratinocytes. 
Since UV radiation is the most important environmental 
skin aggressor, causing skin cancer and other problems 
including  premature  skin  aging,  we  examined  the 
changes  of  gene  expression  in  human  keratinocytes 
after  UV  irradiation  using  oligonucleotide  microarray 
containing over 10,000 genes. We also compared the gene 
expression  patterns  of  the  senescent  and  UV  treated 
cells.  Expression  of  the  variety  of  genes  related  to 
transcription  factors,  cell  cycle  regulation, 
immune 
response was altered in  human keratinocytes.  Some of 
down-regulated  genes  are 
in  both 
senescent and UV treated cells. The results may provide 
a new view of gene expression following UVB exposure 
and aging process in human keratinocytes.

Introduction 
Normal  human  skin  is  covered  by  a  multi-layered 
epidermis  in  which  keratinocytes  (KCs)  undergo  a 
continuous  process  of  proliferation,  differentiation  and 
apoptosis 
is 
responsible  for  protecting  our internal  organs from  the 
toxic external world. Skin protects us from heat, cold, and 
physical  injuries. 
It  also  provides  us  with  sensory

information about the nature of the external world and is 
our first  defense  against  invasion  by  bacteria,  viruses, 
and  other toxic elements.  The skin is also an  excretory 
organ, removing toxins from the body via perspiration. 

Skin  aging  is  characterized  by various  cellular  and 
morphological changes (West,  1994; Yaar eta/., 2002) 
that  come  with  functional  impairments  such  as  slow 
wound  healing  (Gerstein  et  a/.,  1993),  decreased 
protection against ultraviolet radiations (Gilchrest eta/., 
1982), and increased susceptibility to skin cancer (Wei, 
1998).  Most of these  alterations can  be  related  to skin 
senescence,  which  entails  among  others:  reduced 
proliferation  (Gerstein  eta/.,  1993), increased oxidative 
stress  (Chen,  2000)  and  reduced  DNA  repair capacity 
(Moriwaki  et  a/.,  2000).  Cellular  senescence,  initially 
observed  during  subculturing  of  normal  diploid 
fibroblasts,  can  also  be  induced  by  hyperactivation of 
mitogenic  pathways  (Serrano  et  a/.,  1997),  chronic 
exposure to cellular stress, such  as  UV light,  oxidative 
stress  (Chen  and  Ames,  1994),  or  DNA  damaging 
agents 
"premature" 
senescence is indistinguishable from cellular senescence 
induced by serial passaging of human cells, suggesting 
that  cellular  senescence  represents  a  fate  choice 
influenced  by  extracellular  and 
intracellular  signal 
transduction pathways. 
the  molecular 

is 
controlled by the tumor suppressor protein pRb and p53 
(Dimri and Campisi,  1995; Campissi, 2001).  Inactivation 
of  these  tumor  suppressors  results 
in  bypass  of 
senescence.  Due  to  its  essentially  irreversible  growth 
arrest  and  the  requirement  for  p53  and  pRb  function, 
cellular  senescence  is  considered  a  potent  tumor 
suppressor mechanism. 

(Chang  et  a/.,  1999).  This

UV radiation is the most important physical carcinogen 
in  the environment,  and the skin  is  its  main target.  UV 
irradiation,  especially  that  induced  by  UVB  (290-320 
nm), causes the initiation and promotion of skin cancers, 
photo-aging,  and  immune  suppression  (Kripke,  1984; 
Streilein eta/., 1994; Fisher eta/., 1997). UVB has been 
thought to play a crucial role in the photo-carcinogenesis of 
epidermal keratinocytes, given that it introduces various 
types  of  damage  to  cellular  DNA.  One  of  the  earliest 
detectable  responses  of  human  skin  cells  to  UV 
irradiation  is  activation  of  multiple cytokine and  growth 
factor cell surface receptors,  including epidermal growth 

factor  receptor  (EGF-R;  Sachsenmaier  et  a/.,  1994; 
Warmuth  et  a/.,  1994;  Fisher  and  Voorhees,  1998), 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- a receptor (Dy eta/., 1999), 
platelet-activating factor ( PAF) receptor (Dy eta/., 1999), 
insulin  receptor  (Coffer  et a/.,  1995),  interleukin  (IL)-1 
receptor (Rosette and Karin,  1996), and platelet derived 
growth factor (PDGF) receptor (Knebel  eta/., 1996). 

More specifically,  it is proposed that UV activation of 
membrane  receptors  stimulates  MAP  kinases  signal 
transduction  pathways,  via  stimulation  of  GTP-binging 
proteins including ras,  rae,  and cdc42. In support of this, 
activation of the three MAP kinases, ERK, Jnk, and p38 
within  1 hour  of  acute  UV 
radiation  has  been 
demonstrated (Fisher eta/., 1998). This activation is then 
succeeded by increased expression of the transcription 
factors  c-jun  and c-fos that,  together with  other protein 
factors form the transcription factor complex AP-1  (Karin 
and  Hunter,  1995).  Elevated  levels  of  AP-1  are  then 
responsible for inducing expression of  key members of 
the  MMP  family  responsible  for  the  degradation  of 
dermal matrix. 

To  understand  the  mechanisms  of  UV  response 
during  the  aging  process,  we  used  oligonucleotide 
microarray  technology  to  determine  changes  in  gene 
expression in human keratinocytes after UVB treatment. 
Cultured  human  epidermal  keratinocytes  were  treated 
with  40  mJ/cm2 UVB,  and  samples were  collected  at  4 
hours  after  UVB treatment.  Also  senescent  cells  were 
collected  at the  same time.  Oligonucleotide microarray 
containing  over  1 0,000  genes  were  used 
to 
quantitatively  assess  changes  in  gene  expression. 
Some  of  regulated  genes  are  represented  both  of  the 
senescent and  UV treated cells.

instruction.  RNA was amplified and labeled with  Cy3 or 
Cy5.  Samples were hybridized to human 1 Ok oligo chip 
(Macrogen).  Prehybridization  using  hybridization  buffer 
containing  4xSSC,  0.5%  SDS,  0.5%  BSA  was 
performed  at  42°C  for  1  hour.  Prepared  probe  was 
hybridized  with  chip  at  42°C 
for  24  hours.  After 
hybridization, chip was washed at room temperature for 
5 minutes each in solution of wash buffer I (2x SSC/0.1% 
SDS),  wash  buffer  II  (1x  SSC),  wash  buffer  Ill  (0.5% 
SSC),  and  then  dried  by  air  blower.  Images  were 
scanned by using Amersham  Pharmacia Generation  Ill 
scanner. 

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) 
RT-PCR was performed with a Superscipt pre-amplification 
system (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR was performed as 
follows:  first,  a denaturation step of 95 OC  for 5 minutes; 
second, 95 OC  for 1 minute; third, each annealing temperature, 
for 1 minute; fourth,  72QC  for 1 minute; fifth,  72°C  for 10 
minutes.  Amplification  was  performed  by  27  cycles  of 
second to fourth steps. 

SA .(3-galactosidase assay 
Detection of SA-•  -galactosidase (pH 6.0) was performed 
as described by Dimri  eta/. (1995). Cells were washed in 
PBS and fixed for 5 minutes in 3% formaldehyde, resulting 
cells  were  washed  and  incubated  37"C  with  SA-•  -Gal 
staining  solution  (1  mg  of  5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-• 
-D-galactoside/ml (Amersharm life science), 40 mM citric 
acid/sodium  phosphate,  pH  6.0,  5  mM  potassium 
ferrocyanide, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 150 mM NaCI, 
2mM MgCb). 

Staining was evaluated after 24 hours incubation at 
37°C  in  C02. free  incubater.  The  stained  cells  were 
visualized under microscope. 

Analysis of image data 
lmagene 4.0 (BioDiscovery) was used to analyze image 
data.  A three-fold difference in signal  intensity between 
the test and control values was considered to represent a 
significant difference in  gene expression following  UVB 
irradiation and in that of senescence.

Life span and replicative senescence of a primary 
human keratinocytes 
Primary  keratinocytes  were  serially  subcultured  as 
dispersed  cells  in  KGM  until  the  cells  reached  the 
senescent  phase  (Fig.  1 A).  Population  doubling  (PD) 
was measured as a serial cultivation and the split ratio of 
1 :4  was  performed.  The  growth  of 
the  primary 
keratinocytes slowed down around 12 PD and ceased at 
16 PD (Fig.  1 A). 

Morphological  change  at  senescent  keratinocytes 
through microscopic observation was similar to the result 
previously  observed  (Fig.  1 B).  The  senescent  cells 
showed a flattened morphology, perinuclear vacuolization, 
increased  cytoplasmic  to  nuclear  ratio,  and  SA  13-Gal 
expression,  which  are  features  of  senescence  cells 
previously described for primary keratinocytes (Bernard 
et a/.,  2004).  In  contrast,  the  exponential  phase  cells 
showed  undifferentiated  keratinocyte  cell  morphology 
and  did  not  express  detectable  SA  13-Gal  activity. 
Expression  of the  genes  involved  in  the senescencing 
process and p21  as previously described was identified

appeared to be up-regulated by at least three-fold (Table 
2),  and  82 genes appeared to be down-regulated by  at 
least three-fold (Table 3). 

The  differentially  expressed  genes  identified  in  this 
assay  have  been  reported  to  function  in  a  variety  of 
cellular  processes  including  cell  adhesion,  cell  cycle, 
signaling, immune response, transport and other cellular 
functions  (Table  1).  Several  genes  are  worthy  of  note 
due  to  their  association  with  UVB  irradiation  and  their 
known roles in cellular regulatory pathways that have the 
potential  to  be  influenced  by  UVB  irradiation.  Some  of 
those identified by the microarray were validated through 
RT-PCR (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we investigated expression 
of some of those at  12 hours,  24 hours after irradiation 
and in senescence,  respectively (Fig. 38).

Discussion 
As a biological barrier, the skin is continuously subjected 
to  environmental  stresses such  as  ultraviolet radiation, 
pathogens and thermal and chemical insults (Slominski 
and Wortsman, 2000). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the 
sun is among the most ubiquitous damaging environmental 
factors from which human skin must protect itself (Brunet 
et at.,  1999). UVB wavelengths are the most energetic,

absorbed by DNA and protein, and as such account for 
much of the damaging biological effects of UV irradiation 
including cancer and premature skin aging (Fisher et at., 
1997).

To explore a role for UV irradiation in aging of skin, we 
used microarray technology and detected several genes 
with changed expression levels (up- or down-regulated) 
after  exposure  to  UVB.  As  the  results,  63  genes 
appeared  to  be  up-regulated  (Table  2),  and  82  genes 
appeared  to  be  down-regulated  by  at  least  three-fold 
in 
(Table  3).  Expression  of 
metabolism,  signaling, 
transport  were 
suppressed, whereas cell  cycle,  immune response,  cell 
adhesion  were  induced  (Table  1 ).  Some  of  gene 
expression  was  confirmed  by  RT-PCR,  and  then  we 
compared gene expression in UVB-treated cells and the 
senescent cells (Fig.  2).  Two genes of those, CHRNB2 
and  LGALS7  were  decreased  by  UVB  irradiation  and 
senescence.  The other genes were decreased by UVB 
irradiation,  but  increased  in  senescence.  In  previous 
study,  LGALS7 
to  be 
up-regulated in the human keratinocytes at 1 hour after 
UVB irradiation  (Bernerd  et at.,  1999).  However,  in  our 
results,  LGALS7  was  down- regulated  in  UVB-treated 
cells  and  the  senescent  cells.  LGALS7  has  diverse 
biological functions, including regulation of cell adhesion, 
cell growth and apoptosis (Kasai and Hirabayashi, 1996: 
Perillo  et at.,  1998;  Cooper  and  Barondes,  1999;  Liu, 
2000).  In  recent  study,  LGALS7  exhibits  pro-apoptotic 
(lchiro  et  at.,  2002).  However,  our  data

Bcl-3 (B cell  CLUiymphoma 3)  is  a  proto-oncogene 
candidate.  It  is  identified  by  its  translocation  into  the 
immunoglobulin  alpha-locus  in  some  cases  of  B-cell 
leukemia (Franzoso et at.,  1992). This protein functions 
as a transcriptional co-activator that activates through its 
association with NF-kappa B homodimers (Sours et at., 
1993:  Fujita  et at.,  1993).  The expression  of this  gene 
can be induced by NF-kappa B, which forms a part of the 
autoregulatory loop that controls the nuclear residence 
of p50 NF-kappa B (Brasier et at.,  2001). p53 represses 
cyclin D1  transcription through down regulation of Bcl-3 
protein levels. UV irradiation also leads to the repression 
of cyclin D1 and Bcl-3 (Rocha et at.,  2003).  In our study, 
the expression of Bcl-3 was decreased in  UVB- treated 
cells,  which  was  consistent  with  the  previous  study. 
However, in senescent cells, the expression of Bcl-3 was 
increased  differently from  that  of  UVB- treated  cells  in 
our study. 

We  also  compared  SA  j3-Gal  activity  of  young

keratinocytes.  Numerous

population  of  both  UV-treated  cells  and  normal

cells 

These finding combined with our results support that 
the  keratinocytes  after  UV  irradiation  enter  the  initial 
senescent phase and the possibility that UVB-regulated 
genes play an important role in skin aging.
