Osteoporotic fractures (OFs) are critical hard outcomes of osteoporosis and are characterized by decreased bone strength 
induced by low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration in bone tissue. Most OFs cause acute pain, hospitalization, 
immobilization, and slow recovery in patients and are associated with increased mortality. A variety of genetic studies have 
suggested  associations  of  genetic  variants  with  the  risk  of  OF.  Genome-wide  association  studies  have  reported  various 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations (CNVs) in European and Asian populations. To identify CNV 
regions associated with OF risk, we conducted a genome-wide CNV study in a Korean population. We performed logistic 
regression analyses in 1,537 Korean subjects (299 OF cases and 1,238 healthy controls) and identified a total of 8 CNV regions 

significantly associated with OF (p ＜ 0.05).  Then, one CNV region located on chromosome 20q13.12  was selected for 

experimental validation. The selected CNV region was experimentally validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 
The CNV region of chromosome 20q13.12 is positioned upstream of a family of long non-coding RNAs, LINC01260. Our 
findings could provide new information on the genetic factors associated with the risk of OF.

Introduction

Osteoporotic fractures (OFs) result from a decrease in 
bone strength, which can be induced by low bone mass and 
microarchitectural deterioration in bone tissue [1]. OFs are 
the  critical  hard  outcome  of  osteoporosis,  a  disease  that 
affects more than 75 million people in the United States, 
Europe, and Japan. With a lifetime fracture risk of 30% to 
40% (vertebral or non-vertebral fractures), osteoporosis has 
an incidence rate similar to that of coronary artery disease. 
Furthermore, with the exception of forearm fractures, OFs 
are associated with increased mortality. Most fractures cause 
acute  pain  and  lead  to  patient  hospitalization,  immobi-
lization, and slow recovery [2-4]. 

Genetic studies have suggested a correlation of genetic 

variations with OF and its related traits. First, a candidate 
gene  study  has  reported  that  common  non-synonymous 
variants in low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 
5  (LRP5)  are  consistently  associated  with  bone  mineral 
density (BMD) and fracture risk [5]. Furthermore, meta-an-
alyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have 
identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located 
in more than 56 loci independently associated with BMD, 
and some of these studies have also found associations with 
fracture risk [6-13].

Copy number variations (CNVs) also have shown asso-
ciations with OF. A genome-wide CNV study performed in a 
Chinese  population  identified  a  deletion  variant  of  UDP 
glucuronosyltransferase 2 family, polypeptide B17 (UGT2B17) 
in chromosome 4q13.2 associated with OF [14]; however, 
this  variant  was  not  replicated  in  a  study  of  Caucasian

women [15], possibly showing ethnic specificity. Additio-
nally, a rare deletion variant located on chromosome 6p25.1 
showed  an  association  with  the  risk  of  OF  in  a  Dutch 
population [16]. 

Particularly, chromosome 20q13.12 is known as an enriched 
region  of  histone  modifications.  Many  genes  located  on 
chromosome  20q13.12  have  enriched  levels  of  histone 
modifications, such as di-methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 
(H3K4me2) and tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K-
4me3),  in  their  promoter  regions  [17].  H3K4me2  and 
H3K4me3 regulate the expression of the Runx2 gene, which 
encodes a transcription factor controlling bone development 
and  osteoblast  differentiation  [18].  Although  there  is  no 
previous  study  on  an  association  between  chromosome 
20q13.12 and bone-related traits, an SNP in another 20q 
region  (rs4811196  in  CTNBL1,  located  on  20q11.23)  has 
been reported to be associated with BMD [19].

In this study, we conducted an association study in the 
Korean population to identify new susceptibility loci for the 
risk of OF. We identified 8 CNV regions associated with the 
risk  of  OF  through  a  statistical  analysis.  Among  the  8 
regions, we selected and validated the existence of one CNV 
by quantitative PCR.

Methods
Study subjects and diagnostic criteria for OF

A total of 10,038 participants from the Korea Association 
Resource  (KARE)  were  recruited.  Among  the  recruited 
individuals, 1,537 subjects, consisting of 299 OF cases and 
1,238 normal controls, who agreed to an X-ray examination 
were  genotyped  with  the  NimbleGen  HD2  3  ×  720K 
comparative  genomic  hybridization  array  (aCGH).  This 
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the 
Korea  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention,  and 
written informed consent was provided to all participants, 
including cases and controls. The clinical characteristics of 
the study participants are summarized in Table 1. We used

low trauma fracture events to distinguish between fracture 
and non-fracture groups of the KARE study. Fractures were 
only included if they had occurred with low trauma (e.g., fall 
from standing height or less) at any of six sites (hip, wrist, 
humerus, rib, pelvis, and vertebra) after the age of 40 years. 
Fractures clearly caused by high trauma events (e.g., motor 
vehicle  accidents,  violence,  or  falls  from  more  than  the 
standing height of the individual) were excluded.

Platform of CNV genotyping 

We used the Roche NimbleGen 3 × 720 K aCGH platform 
for  CNV  calling.  This  platform  was  designed  as  a 
whole-genome and CNV-focused type, composed of a total 
of 720,000 probes. The median inter-probe spacing of the 
backbone was ＜5 kb. DNA extracted from the NA10851 cell 
line was utilized as a reference for the aCGH to yield the 
signal intensity ratio with hg18/NCBI build 36. All of the 
samples in our study satisfied experimental control metrics, 
such as chromosome X shift and mad.1dr, with NimbleScan 
v.2.5 to adapt systemic biases in the microarray experiment. 
The signal intensity ratio of each probe was converted into 
log2 scale with the positions of the probes after a quality 
control process.

CNV discovery

CNV discovery consisted of two steps: CNV calling and 
determination of the CNV region. For CNV calling, we used 
a  package,  called  “Genome  Alteration  Detection  Analysis 
(GADA),” which implements a flexible and efficient pipeline 
to detect copy number alterations from microarray data [20]. 
To avoid a limitation caused in the single detection tool, we 
found the best parameter (T = 10, alpha = 0.2, and Min-
SegLen = 10) that compared a known CNV region and CNVs 
tested using several parameters [21]. CNV was employed as 
the average log2 ratio of ±0.25 of probes in all individual. To 
estimate CNV genotypes, a CNV region was defined with a 
log2 ratio identified between the reference sample and test 
sample  in  the  calling  process.  It  is  hard  to  define  exact 
genotype cluster of a CNV detected in a single individual. To 
discover CNV regions, we employed CNVs that were called 
in over three individuals [22].

Genotype estimation

CNV genotypes consist of zero copies, one copy, and two 
copies. To do this, we used an R package, named ‘CNVtools,’ 
with default parameters to estimate CNV genotypes [23]. 
CNVtools is a mixture model for one-dimensional CNV data 
summary that can separate samples into each CNV geno-
type. To estimate genotype, we employed the linear discri-
mination function, which uses a raw signal and pca signal 
calculated from the average log2 ratio of all individuals using

CNVtools. CNV genotypes consist of three genotype groups: 
“single-class,” “multiple-class,” and “ambiguous” (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1) [24, 25]. We performed an association study 
with only well-clustered “multiple-class” CNV regions.

slightly higher than in the cases (70% in cases vs. 72% in 
controls, data not shown). Mean age, height, weight, and 
body mass index showed no significant differences between 
cases and controls.

Statistical analysis

Selection of candidate CNV regions

Logistic  regression  analysis  was  performed  using  R 
package version 3.0.2 to find significant association signals 
between CNV loci and OF risk. Age, height, and weight were 
adjusted as covariates to calibrate the statistical significance. 
Genotypes  of  each  CNV  were  coded  as  0  (homozygous 
deletion) and 1 (heterozygous deletion) for two-class CNV 
loci. In the case of three-class CNVs, their genotypes were 
coded as 0 (homozygous deletion), 1 (heterozygous deletion), 
and 2 (normal). 

Validation of CNVs

We carried out quantitative PCR using the TaqMan Copy 
Number Assay (Life Technologies, Foster City, CA, USA) 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocols  to  verify  esti-
mated CNV regions. In total, seven pre-designed and one 
custom designed probe was used to validate the existence of 
the CNV. Validation samples, including cases and controls, 
were  randomly  selected  from  each  estimated  genotype 
cluster. All validation experiments were replicated 3 times to 
increase the accuracy of the validation. The copy number in 
each individual was calculated with Copy Caller v2.0 using 
the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method according to 
the manufacturer’s protocols.

Results
Characteristics of study subjects

A total of 1,537 Korean individuals, consisting of 299 OF 
patients  and  1,238  normal  controls,  participated  in  this 
study (Table 1). There were 415 males and 1,122 females in 
the overall population. The ratio of females in controls was 

To select candidate CNV regions, we manually performed 
a visual inspection to classify well-clustered “multiple-class” 
regions into genotype groups. In total, 3,660 multiple-class 
CNV regions were selected for the association study. Of the 
3,660 CNV regions, 518 CNV regions were two-class regions 
(one  and  two  copies)  and  3,142  were  three-class  regions 
(zero, one, and two copies) (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Association analysis of CNV regions with OF risk

We  performed  logistic  regression  analysis  to  evaluate 
associations between identified CNV regions and OF risk. 
As a result, we identified a total of eight CNV loci associated 
with OF (p ＜ 0.05) (Table 2)—distributed on chromosome 
4q13.1, 4q13.2, 9q34.2, 13q12.2, 14q24.3, 14q31.3, 20p13, 
and 20q13.12. The OF-associated loci were located in in-
tergenic  regions  near  SRIP1;  TMPRSS11E;  POLR1D;  LOC-
100421611; a family of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), 
LINC01260;  and  genic  regions  of  ABO,  ELMSAN1,  and 
SIRPA.  The base-pair  lengths  of  the eight  regions  ranged 
from  1.9  kb  to  18.6  kb.  The  CNVs  in  ABO  and  SIRPA 
included  both  exonic  and  intronic  regions  of  each  gene, 
whereas the CNV locus in ELMSAN1 included only intronic 
regions.

region  using  web-based  public  data.  Many  previously 
reported CNVs, including the chr20: 42739446–42741539 
region, were identified using the UCSC Genome Browser 
(http://genome.uscs.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway) (Supplementary 
Fig.  3).  Also,  frequencies  of  reported  CNVs  evaluated  in 
various  ethnic  groups  were  presented  in  the  Database  of 
Genomic Variants (DGV, http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home) 
(Supplementary Table 1). 

To  experimentally  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  CNV,  we 
performed quantitative PCR. The position of the CNV probe 
was defined based on hg19/NCBI build 37. The probe ID 
used for the TaqMan genotyping assay of the validated CNVs 
is listed in Table 3. Applications of a positive predictive value 
as  a  measurement  standard  of  accuracy  indicated  the 
proportion of positive results in the validation of the CNV 
region.  The positive  predictive value  of the  verified CNV 
region evaluated in our validation was 0.82. Fig. 1 shows the 
genotype  of  the  identified  CNV  region,  verified  by 
quantitative PCR.

Discussion

In this study, we performed a GWAS to investigate the 
associations between identified CNV regions and the risk of 
OF. A total of eight CNV loci were identified to be nominally

associated with OF. For validation, we selected one CNV 
region based on position and expected biological meaning 
among  the  eight  loci.  The  CNV,  which  is  located  on 
chromosome 20q13.12 (intergenic region near LINC01260) 
was experimentally validated through quantitative PCR.

An lncRNA is defined as a non-coding transcript having a 
length of more than 200 nucleotides [26] and is considered 
“junk”  that  is  non-functional  initially  [27].  However,  the 
functional roles of lncRNAs have now been identified, such 
as key regulators of transcriptional and translational pro-
ducts that affect cell functions [28-31]. lncRNAs play a role 
in  epigenetic  effects,  such  as  histone  modification  (e.g., 
methylation),  which  regulates  gene  expression  [32].  A 
significant histone modification, monomethylation of lysine 
4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1) in human mammary epithelial 
cells, was predicted in our identified CNV region near an 
lncRNA,  LINC01260,  using  University  of  California  Santa 
Cruz  (UCSC)  Genome  Browser  (http://genome.uscs.edu/ 
cgi-bin/hgGateway)  (Supplementary  Fig.  4).  A  previous 
genome-wide  study  has 
identified  several  runs  of 
homozygosity (ROHs) associated with BMD and observed 
the enrichment of H3K4me1 in two ROHs, ROH15q22.3 
and  ROH1p31.1,  by  an  analysis  of  histone  modification 
marks in the Gm12878 cell line [33]. Taken together, our 
identified CNV region on 20q13.12 might have a putative 
effect  on  the  risk  of  OF  by  histone  modification  of  the

In addition, a CNV on chromosome 20q13.12 is located in 
a region about 35 kb apart from the WISP2 gene. The WISP2 
gene  has  some  evidence  of  functions  associated  with 
bone-related  traits.  WISP2,  also  known  as  CCN  family 
member 5 (CCN5) or connective tissue growth factor like 
(CTGF-L), was identified as a member of the CCN family, 
downstream  of  the  WNT–β-catenin  signaling  pathway, 
using subtractive hybridization between WNT1-transformed 
mammary epithelial cells and parental cells [34]. The WNT–
β-catenin  signaling  pathway  has  been  suggested  to  be  a 
major component in the accrual, regulation, and maintenance 
of  bone  mass  [35].  WISP2  consists  of  3  domains:  an 
insulin-like growth factor binding domain, a von Willebrand 
Factor type C motif, and a thrombospondin type I repeat. The 
mRNA of WISP2 is expressed in primary human osteoblasts, 
fibroblasts,  ovary,  testes,  and  heart.  WISP2  protein  is 
secreted  from  primary  human  osteoblasts  and  fibroblasts 
[36].  A  previous  study  has  shown  the  relatedness  of 
increased  mRNA  expression  of  WISP2  with  rheumatoid 
arthritis and osteoarthritis [34]. Furthermore, the WISP2 
gene has been reported as a candidate gene that is associated 
with an OF-related trait, BMD [37].
WISP2 expression is affected by the action of LRP5. LRP5 
has been known to play a role in signaling through WNT–β
-catenin and acts as a co-receptor with the frizzled family of 
receptors [38]. Previous research has reported that the LRP5 
mutation (G171V), inducing the enhancement of structural 
strength and material properties of skeleton and bone mass, 
is correlated with increased expression of WISP2 [38]. Also, 
WISP2 is suggested to be involved in the frizzled receptors/ 
LRP5/6 pathway by phosphorylation of LRP5 [39]. Consi-
dering  the  previously  reported  functions  and  interactions 
with  LRP5  in  the  WNT–β-catenin  signaling  pathway, 
WISP2 could be an important component for bone formation 
or strength, which might affect the risk of OF. 

In  conclusion,  we  identified  a  total  of  8  CNV  regions 
associated with OF in the Korean population. Among the 8 
CNVs, one locus, located on chromosome 20q13.12, was 
selected  for  validation  and  verified  by  quantitative  PCR. 
Although further study in a larger number of study subjects 
is needed, to our knowledge, the current report is the first to 
investigate the association with the risk of OF. Our findings 
from this study could provide new insights into the genetic 
factors associated with OF risk.
