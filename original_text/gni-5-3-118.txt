Abstract 
The current existing literature offers little guidance on how 
to decide which  method to use to analyze one-channel 
microarray  measurements  when  dealing  with  large, 
grouped samples. Most previous methods have focused 
on  two-channel  data;therefore  they  can  not  be  easily 
applied  to  one-channel  microarray data.  Thus,  a more 
reliable method is required to determine an appropriate 
combination  of individual  basic  processing  steps  for a 
given  dataset  in  order  to  improve  the  validity  of  one(cid:173)
channel expression data analysis. We address key issues 
in evaluating the effectiveness of basic statistical processing 
steps of microarray data that can affect the final outcome of 
gene expression analysis without focusingon the intrinsic 
data underlying biological interpretation.

Introduction 
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is known to be a complex 
disease  related  with  several  genes.  In  order to  identify 
differentially-expressed genes, a large gene expression 
dataset was  obtained  using  a one-channel  microarray 
experiment conducted on 173 patients. The patients were 
classified into five groups of CFS, and 20,160 genes were 
represented.  Unlike the usual microarray experiment, this 
study contained a very large number of slides. Unfortunately, 
however, our preliminary analysis yielded few significant 
genes differentially expressed among the five groups. This 
result was quite surprising, because 173 patients would be 
regarded as quite a large sample size in a typicalmicroarray 
experiment.  Thus,  we  expect that  the  significant  gene 
effect  is  quite  moderate.  Recently,  microarray  data

interpretation has been mainly focused on the comparisons 
between the high density oligonucleotide-based chip and 
two-channel  eDNA  microarrays  (Bolstad  et  a/.,  2003; 
Edwards 2003; Futschik eta/., 2004; Cui eta/., 2003; Smyth 
eta/., 2003). Current literature offers little guidance on how 
to decide which method to use or how to compare different 
methods to obtain final  results.  These  effects are most 
problematic,  especially 
for  one-channel  microarray 
measurements when dealing with large, grouped samples 
(Edwards, 2003). In this paper, we focus on the effect of data 
processing on the interpretation of gene expression data for 
a one-channel microarray experiment when the gene effect 
is  not  large.  We  focus  on  evaluating  the  effect  of 
normalization methods in identifying differentially-expressed 
genes. 

Materials and Methods 
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) dataset 
We analyzed a large gene expression dataset obtained 
from a one-channel oligonucleotide experiment conducted 
on 173 patients who were classified into five groups of chronic 
fatigue syndrome, and 20160 genes were represented. The 
data  in  this  study  describe  CFS  that  has  no  diagnostic 
clinical signs. It is unclear if CFS represents a single illness 
(whistler eta/., 2005). The samples were classified into five 
groups based on information from clinical consensus: 36 
patients in the non-fatigued (NF) group, 46 patients in the 
chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) group, 47 patients in the 
group  labeled  chronically  fatigued  but  without  CFS 
because of an insufficient number of symptoms (ISF), 20 
patients in the chronically fatigued but with ISF and a major 
depressive disorder with melancholic features (ISF-MDDm) 
group, and 19 patients with CFS with a major depressive 
disorder with melancholic features (CFS-MDDm). The NF 
group was defined as the control group, whereas the other 
four groups were defined as case groups based on various 
definitions of CFS. The final goal of the experiment was 
to  identify differentially-expressed  for the  group  pairs: 
control (NF) vs. case (all4 groups);control (NF) vs case 
(CFS);control (NF) vs case (CFS-MDDm);control (NF) vs 
case (ISF);control (NF) vs case (ISF-MDDm);control (NF) 
vs case (ISF-MDDm+CFS-MDDm);and control  (NF) vs. 
case  (ISF+CFS).  Findings  from  our study will  suggest 
future studies needed to identify the underlying etiology of

chronic fatigue syndrome;the dataset used for this study 
is not intended to focus on the intrinsic data underlying 
biological interpretation. 

Quality Control Analysis and Outlier Detection 
The  first  processing  step  is  outlier  detection,  and  we 
performed several  methods to examine outlying slides. 
Fig. 1 is the result of the principal component analysis for 
the five  groups,  which  identifies distinct outlying  slides 
visually. We observed that samples 11 from the CFS-MDD 
group and 1 from the ISF group were separated from the 
dense group and could be classified as outlying slides. In 
addition,  we  examined  slides  with  unusual  expression 
patterns or large variability through diagnostic plots (Park 
eta/., 2005). These outlying slides tend to have large impacts 
on  analyses  such  as  the  identification  of  differentially(cid:173)
expressed genes. Therefore, we applied graphical methods 

to detect outlying sample slides. VVith this measure of quality 
control, we were able to compare variability among slides 
of samples and  minimize the amount of errors made in 
statistical  data  preparation  of one-channel  microarray 
data.  Fig.  2  is the diagnostic plot for detecting outlying 
slides. The plot shows that slides 11, 162, and 158 seemed 
to have quite different patterns from those of other slides. 
Slide  11  was  also  identified  by  principal  component 
analysis, showing a very clearly distinctive pattern from 
those of other slides. In order to evaluate the effect of the 
outlier  slides,  we  performed  leave-one  out  analysis. 
Finally, we used the dataset, removing these three outlier 
slides (slides  11,  162, and  158), for further analysis. 

Normalization 
The plot in Fig. 3 is the boxplot of the original intensity data 
from five individual sample groups before normalization. We

performed the normalization process for each of the five 
individual sample groups as examined in Fig. 3. The first 
plot in  Fig.  4 is the group-level  plot for these raw data, 
showing  the  25th,  50th,  and  75th  percentile  for  each 
sample of the five groups. The x-axis represents the slide, 
and they-axis represents quartiles of the actual intensities. 
This  group-level  plot  allows  us  to  investigate  group(cid:173)
specific variations within  the data.  The group-level  plot 
clearly showed different levels of expression data for the 
different sample groups. The next processing step was the 
normalization procedure performed by Quantile, LOWESS, 
and IQR scale normalization methods (Yang eta/., 2002; 
Irizarry et a/2003; Li  eta/., 2003). 
Quantile nonnalization 
The goal of the quantile method is to make the distribution 
of probe intensities for each array in a set of arrays the 
same. 

Let qk =  (q,1 ,  .... qkn)  fork= 1,  ... ,p be the vector of the 
kth  quantiles for  all  n  arrays.  qk=  (qkp .... q,,)and 
;_  ....  ~ l let  be the unit diagonal. To transform the 
d=  ( 
vn 
quantiles so that they all lie along the diagonal, consider 
the projection of q onto d: 

vn 

This  implies that we  can  give  each  array  the  same 
distribution by taking the mean quantile and substitute it 
as the value of the data item in the original dataset. This 
motivates the following algorithm for normalizing a set of 
data vectors by giving them the same distribution: 

1.  Given n arrays of length p, form Yof dimension p x 

n where each array is a column. 

2.  Sort each column of X to give  Ysort 

3.  Take the means across rows of Y sort and assign this 

mean to each element in the row to get  Y ', 0

, 1 

4.  Get Ynormalized by rearranging each column of  Y 'sort 

to have the same ordering as original  Y. 

- Y 2 against A= Y1+ Y2

LOWESS nonna/ization 
Another approach is LOWESS normalization based on an 
M versus A plot, where M is the difference in log expression 
values and A is the average of the log expression values. 
To normalize two arrays with one-channel intensity,  it is 
straightforward to adapt the approach proposed by Yang 
eta/. (2001) for correcting dye bias in two-channel data, 
as follows.  Let the log  intensities from the two arrays be 
Y 1  = (yi,  y~, ... ,yj,),  Y2 = (yi, y~, ... ,yJ,). Consider the plot of 
1vf=  Y 1
, which corresponds to a 
clockwise  rotation  of the  ( Y\  Y2
}  plot  by  45  degrees 
followed  by rescaling  and  fit a locally weighted  smooth 
regression  (loess)  f(A)  to  these  (M,  A)  data.  The 
adjustmentconsistsofreplacing  Y1  by  Y1  =  Y 1-J(A)/2 
and  Y2  by  Y 2  =  Y2
- f(A)/2.  Bolstad  et  a/.  (2003) 
extended this method to a series of k arrays, with data in 
the form  Y 1 
, ... , Y  ". However, rather than being applied 
to two-color channels on the same array, it was applied to 
sample intensities from two arrays at a time. Because this 
method works in a pairwise manner, it is somewhat time 
consuming (Li  et a/.,2001 ).

IQR (interquarti/e range nonna/ization)

Fig.  4  summarizes  the  plots  after  applying  these 
normalization methods. Fig. 4 shows the different effects 
of normalization methods. Fig 4(a) shows the patterns of 
the 25th,  50th,  and 75th quantiles of raw data from  170 
slides.  Fig 4(b) and Fig 4(c) show the pattern of each of 
the 25th, 50th, and 75th quantiles of LOWESS- normalized 
data and quantile-normalized data.  In the next section, we 
show that  these  normalization  methods  produce  quite 
different results for identifying differentially-expressed genes. 

Results and Discussion 
Table  1  is  the  summary  table  for  comparing  different 
normalization  methods  regarding  their  effects  on  the 
identification of differentially-expressed genes. It shows 
the  estimated  number of significant genes for different 
group pairs. The simplest statistical method for detecting 
differential expression is the t-test for identifying differentially(cid:173)
regulated  genes  between  group  pairs  from  5  groups, 
whereas  the  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  test  was

applied to identify differentially-regulated genes for the five 
groups in  Table  1.  We  also  applied  some  widely-used 
methods for testing differential expression among genes 
starting  with  the  simple  fold-change  criteria  using  the 
volcano plot, which can evaluate both the direction and the 
size of an effect using intensity ratios and log-transformed 
p-values simultaneously. Fig. 5(a) shows that the volcano 
plot for LOWESS normalization comparing CFS and NF 
yielded  asymmetric fold-change  distributions,  and  more 
genes appeared to be upregulated than downregulated due 
to the differences of these two group-levels, whereas quantile 
normalization (Fig. 5(b )) produced approximately symmetric 
distributions.  We  expected  approximately  the  same 
number of up- and downregulated genes. Table 1 showed 
that the  estimated  number of regulated  genes  in  each 
group  comparison  depended  on 
the  normalization 
methods used. We did not see any clear difference in these 
data to determine which  normalization  method  is  more 
appropriate  for  finding  regulated  genes.  We  began 
analyzing the  original  data  (raw data) without applying 
normalization methods and then compared those results 
with other normalization methods. The effect was most 
pronounced  in  the  comparison  between  NF  and  CFS(cid:173)
MDDm,  depending  on  the  normalization  method.  We 
address key issues in evaluating the effectiveness of basic 
statistical  processing steps of microarray data that can 
affect the final outcome of gene expression analysis that 
is  not intended to focus on  the intrinsic data underlying 
biological interpretation in this study. We presented some 
normalization methods and showed that different norma(cid:173)
lization  methods  yield  different  results.  Most  previous 
normalization  methods  have focused  on  two-channel  or 
Affymetrix-type data;therefore they are not easily applied to 
our one-channel microarray data. Due to this reason, it is 
necessary that some modifications and slight adaptation 
be applied to this kind of data to have reasonable results 
in  further  studies.  The  use  of  quality  measures  for 
analyzing individual outcomes can help in estimating the 
reliability of final microarray study results. In particular, the 
study presented here showed that when the gene effect is 
not as large as in our example, microarray data normalization 
and individual processing steps have an important effect on 
the  final  outcome,especially  for  the  identification  of 
differentially-expressed genes. In further studies, we may 
consider the effects of normalization methods when the gene 
effect is large. It is important to test different possibilities and 
analyze the effects of normalization with the appropriate 
tools for individual processing steps. Thus, a more reliable 
method is required to determine an appropriate combination 
of individual basic processing steps for a given dataset in 
order to improve the validity of one-channel expression data 
analysis.  Therefore,  the  overview  of  these  effects  is 

essential for the biological interpretation of gene expression 
measurements.
