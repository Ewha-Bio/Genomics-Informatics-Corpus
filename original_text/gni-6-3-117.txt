Abstract

Recently,  obesity  has  become  a  worldwide  public  health 
concern  and  the  use  of  anorectic  drugs  has  drastically 
increased.  In  this  study,  sibutramine  and  phendime-
trazine,  representative  marketed  anorectics,  were  re-
peatedly  administered  per os  on  a  daily  basis  into 
C57BL/6  mice  and  the  effects  of  these  drugs  on  food 
intakes,  body  weight  changes  and  gene  expression  pro-
files  were  monitored  for  up  to  following  7  days. 
Methamphetamine,  which  has  a  potent  anorectic  effect, 
was  used  as  a  positive  control.  Anorectic  effects  were 
sustained  only  for  two  days  by  phendimetrazine  or 
methamphetamine,  but  for  six  days  by  sibutramine.  The 
modulations  of  gene  expressions  in  the  hypothalamus 
and  the  striatum  were  investigated  using  microarrays  on 
day  2  and  day  7  post-administration,  which  corre-
sponded  to  the  anorectic  period  and  a  return  of  appetite 
respectively,  for  all  three  drugs  tested.  Differences  in 
overall  gene  expression  profiles  in  the  stratum  on  day  2 
for  sibutramine  and  phendimetrazine  seems  to  reflect 
difference  between  the  two  in  terms  of  the  onsets  of 
drug  tolerance.  According  to  microarray  findings,  the 
Ankrd26  gene  appears  to  have  an  important  anorectic 
role,  whereas  the  up-regulation  of  the  olfaction  system 
appeared  to  be  involved  in  the  drug  tolerance  of 
anorectics.  The  microarray  data  presented  in  this  study 
demonstrates  the  usefulness  of  gene  expression  analy-
sis  for  gathering  information  on  the  efficacy  and  safety 
of  anorectic  drugs.

Introduction

Obesity  has  increased  and  become  a  worldwide  public 
health  problem.  Most  of  the  drugs  used  to  treat  obesity 
are  appetite  suppressants  that  stimulate  the  central 
nervous  system  (CNS),  and  these  often  have  side  ef-
fects,  such  as,  tolerance,  addiction,  and  cardiovascular 
problems. 
    Sibutramine  is  a  representative  anti-obesity  drug  that 
inhibits  serotonin  (5-hydroxytryptamine,  5-HT)  and  nora-
drenaline  reuptake  (Stock,  1997).  The  mechanism  under-
lying  the  anti-obesity  effect  of  sibutramine  is  believed  to 
involve  satiety  (Halford et al.,  1998)  and  the  stimulation 
of  thermogenesis  (Conneley  et al.,  1999;  Liu  et al., 
2002).  In  fact,  pre-treatment  with  serotonin  or  nor-
epinephrine  antagonists  can  reduce  the  anorectic  effect 
of  sibutramine  (Grignaschi et al.,  1999),  which  indicates 
that  the  anorectic  effect  of  sibutramine  is  related  to  the 
inhibition  of  the  reuptakes  of  norepinephrine  (Balcioglu 
et  al.,  2000)  and  serotonin  (Buckett  et  al.,  1988; 
Gundlah et al.,  1997).  Sibutramine  is  an  approved  drug 
for  the  long-term  treatment  for  obesity,  but  has  been  re-
ported  to  increase  mean  systolic  and  diastolic  blood 
pressures  and  heart  rate  (Eric  Colman,  2005). 
    Phendimetrazine  has  also  been  widely  prescribed  as 
an  anorectic  for  the  treatment  of  obesity,  and  has  been 
reported  to  have  properties  similar  to  methamphetamine, 
which  is  known  to  suppress  appetite  by  activating  cat-
echolaminergic  neurotransmission  (Seiden  et al.,  1993; 
Chen  et al.,  2001).  Methamphetamine  is  known  to  pri-
marily  block  dopamine  transporter,  which  inhibits  dop-
amine  reuptake,  indicating  that  dopamine  up-regulation 
has  an  anorectic  effect  (Mackler et al.,  1993).  Because 
phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine  stimulate  the 
central  nervous  system  to  produce  euphoria,  probably 
via  the  activation  of  dopaminergic  systems  in  the  brain 
(Nailles  et al.,  2003),  these  drugs  are  restricted  to 
short-term  use  (a  few  weeks)  and  prominently  labeled  to 
warn  against  the  risk  of  addiction.
    However,  although  many  anorectics  are  available,  evi-
dence  is  still  lacking  concerning  their  efficacies,  safeties, 
and  molecular  mechanisms.  Recently,  cDNA  microarray 
studies  on  gene  expression  profile  changes  by  amphet-
(Noailles  et  al.,  2003; 
amine  have  been  reported 
Yamamoto et al.,  2005),  but  no  such  report  has  been  is-
sued  on  other  anorectics.  In  this  study,  we  employed 

118    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  6(3)  117-125,  September  2008

microarray  techniques  to 
investigate  the  gene  ex-
pression  profiles  of  two  representative  anorectics,  sibutr-
amine  and  phendimetrazine  and  to  compare  these  with 
that  of  methamphetamine  in  mouse  brain.  By  comparing 
the  gene  expressional  patterns  of  these  drugs  in  differ-
ent  parts  of  mouse  brain,  we  were  able  to  identify 
genes  whose  expressions  were  specifically  or  commonly 
modulated  by  these  drugs.  We  are  in  the  belief  that 
these  identified  genes  would  provide  a  molecular  back-
ground  and  facilitate  our  understanding  of  the  efficacies 
and  safeties  of  anorectic  drugs. 

Methods

Animals

Mice  were  acclimated  in  the  animal  facility  for  seven 
days  prior  to  commencing  this  study.  Male  C57BL/6 
mice  (20∼25  g,  Orient  Bio,  Korea)  were  housed  in-
dividually  in  standard  animal  cages.  All  animal  experi-
ments  were  performed  in  accordance  with  a  program 
accredited  by  the  Association  for  the  Assessment  and 
Accreditation  of  Laboratory  Animal  Care  (AAALAC).

the  experiments.  Vehicle,  methamphetamine 

Methamphetamine 
(Dream-
pharma,  Korea)  and  sibutramine  (Knoll  AG,  Ludwigsha-
fen,  Germany)  were  dissolved  in  deionized  water.  The 
effects  of  these  anorectic  drugs  on  food  intake  and 
body  weight  were  monitored  on  a  daily  basis  for  seven 
days.  64  C57BL/6  mice  (n=16  mice/group)  were  used 
for 
(5 
mg/kg),  phendimetrazine  (60  mg/kg)  or  sibutramine  (5 
mg/kg)  were  repeatedly  administered per os  to  the  ani-
mals  on  a  daily  basis.  And  deionized  water  was  used  as 
vehicle  control.  After  the  drug  administrations,  food  and 
water  were  freely  provided  for  following  18  hours  before 
monitoring  daily  food  intake  and  body  weight  changes. 
On  day  2  and  day  7  post-administration,  respectively,  a 
half  of  the  animals  in  each  group  were  sacrificed  for 
brain  isolation  and  mRNA  extraction.

RNA  isolation  and  DNA  microarray

Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  brain  tissues  using  Trizol 
reagent  (Invitrogen)  in  accordance  with  the  manu-
facturer’s  instructions.  Quantity  and  purity  (260/280  ra-
tio)  of  RNA  were  monitored  using  a  ND-1000  UV/VIS 
spectrophotometer  (NanoDrop  Technologies,  Wilmington, 
DE,  USA).  Differential  gene  expressions  were  profiled 
using  mouse  genome  survey  array  chips 
(Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  containing  60-mer  oligonu-

cleotide  probes  representing  a  set  of  32,996  individual 
mouse  genes  and  more  than  1,000  control  probes. 
Microarray  experiments  were  performed  according  to 
the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  Digoxigenin  (DIG)-UTP- 
labeled  cRNA  was  generated  from  5μg  of  total  RNA 
and  amplified  using  chemiluminescent  reverse  tran-
scription  in  vitro  transcription  (RT-IVT)  labeling  kits 
(Applied  Biosystems).  Briefly,  each  microarray  was  pre-
hybridized  in  hybridization  buffer  with  blocking  reagent 
at  55oC  for  1  h.  DIG-labeled  cRNA  targets  (10μg)  were 
fragmented  to  100∼400  bps  and  hybridized  with  each 
prehybridized  microarray  at  55oC  for  16  h.  Arrays  were 
then  washed  with  hybridization  wash  buffer  followed  by 
chemiluminescence  rinse  buffer.  Chemiluminescent  sig-
nals  were  generated  by  incubating  arrays  with  anti-DIG 
alkaline  phosphatase  and  chemiluminescence  substrate. 
Images  were  collected  for  each  microarray  using  a 
Model  1700  Chemiluminescent  Microarray  Analyzer 
(Applied  Biosystems). 

Analysis  of  microarray  expression  data

Signal  intensities  were  imported  into  Avadis  software 
(Strand  and  Stratagene,  India).  To  minimize  the  effects 
of  external  variables,  inter-array  quantile  normalization 
was  performed.  Average  values  of  gene  expression  ra-
tios  obtained  from  three  replicates  were  calculated. 
Differentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  were  selected 
based  on  fold  changes  of  ≥2  and  a  Welch’s  t-test 
probability  value  of  ≤0.05.  For  further  analysis,  DEGs 
were  categorized  according  to  their  biological  functions 
using  the  PANTHER  (Protein  ANalysis  THrough  Evolutio-
nary  Relationships)  classification  system  (Applied  Bio-
systems,  https://panther.appliedbiosystems.com). 

Results  and  Discussion

Effect  of  anorectics  on  food  intakes  and  body 
weights  changes  in  C57BL/6  mice 

    To  identify  genes  related  to  the  effects  of  anorectic 
drugs,  we  repeatedly  administered  single  doses  of 
phendimetrazine  (60  mg/kg.),  sibutramine  (5  mg/kg),  or 
methamphetamine  (5  mg/kg,  positive  control) per os  to 
C57BL/6  mice  for  up  to  7  days  and  monitored  daily 
changes  in  food  intake  and  body  weight  over  seven 
days.  Fig.  1  shows  the  effects  of  the  three  drugs  on 
food  intake  (Fig.  1A,  B)  and  body  weight  (Fig.  1C,  D)  as 
comparing  to  vehicle  only  (Fig.  1A,  C)  and  baseline  (Fig. 
1B,  D),  respectively.  Rates  of  food  intake  were  sig-
nificantly  suppressed  in  all  three  treated  groups.  The 
phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine  treated  groups 
showed  a  maximum  anorectic  effect  and  weight  loss  on

day  2  post-administration.  After  day  2,  animals  in  these 
groups  slowly  recovered  appetite  and  gained  body 
weight  to  the  control  level.  In  contrast,  the  sibutr-
amine-treated  group,  which  exhibited  the  best  anorectic 
effect  and  greatest  weight  loss  at  2  days  post-admin-
istration  and  drug  effects  were  sustained  up  to  day  6. 
However,  on  day  7  animals  recovered  their  appetites  in 
all  treatment  groups. 
    Phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine  show  similar 
biochemical  and  behavioral  properties  (Crowin  et al., 
1987;  Evans  and  Johanson  et al.,  1987;  Jones  and 

Holtzman  1994),  and  have  both  been  reported  to  release 
dopamine  and  norepinephrine  (Rothman  et al.,  2002). 
Moreover,  the  mechanism  underlying  the  anorectic  ef-
fect  of  these  drugs  has  been  attributed  to  the  activation 
of  catecholaminergic  neurotransmission  (Seiden,  et al., 
1993;  Chen et al.,  2001).  On  the  other  hand,  sibutramine 
acts  on  serotonergic  and  noradrenergic  pathways  and 
has  been  demonstrated  to  effectively  reduce  body 
weight  by  reducing  food  intake  and  by  modulating  en-
ergy  expenditure  (Strack  et al.,  2002).  These  previous 
observations  may  explain  why  the  anorectic  effects  of 

120    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  6(3)  117-125,  September  2008

sibutramine  differed  from  those  of  methamphetamine 
and  phendimetrazine  in  the  present  study.  To  better  un-
derstand  the  modes  of  action  of  these  anorectic  drugs, 
we  employed  microarray  techniques  and  investigated 
genes  specifically  and  commonly  modulated  by  these 
anorectic  agents.

modulated  large  number  of  genes  in  the  striatum  on  day 
2,  which  implies  that  it  stimulates  the  central  nervous 
system  like  methamphetamine.  In  the  case  of  sibutr-
amine,  gene  expression  patterns  differed  slightly  from 
those  of  phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine.  Sibu-
tramine  highly  modulated  gene  expression  only  on  day  2 

Genes  differentially  expressed  in  hypothalamus 
and  striatum  by  sibutramine,  phendimetrazine, 
and  methamphetamine 

Gene  expression  profiling  was  performed  to  examine  the 
temporal  effects  of  the  three  drugs  on  gene  expression. 
Control  of  food  intake  and  energy  expenditure  involves 
a  complex  network  of  neuropeptides,  distributed 
throughout  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  but  mainly 
in  the  hypothalamus  (Schwartz et al.,  2000;  Saper et al., 
2002).  In  the  mammalian  striatum,  the  basal  ganglia  nu-
cleus  subsumes  many  complex  behaviors  including 
feeding  and  sexual  behavior 
(Alheid,  G.F.,  2003, 
Saint-Cyr,  J.A.,  2003).  As  described  above,  the  three 
drugs  showed  a  maximum  effect  on  day  2  post-admin-
istration,  though  sibutramine  had  a  sustained  effect  up 
to  day  6.  Based  on  these  observations,  total  RNAs  ex-
tracted  from  hypothalamus  and  striatum  on  days  2  and 
7  were  subjected  to  microarray  analysis. 
    Table  1  shows  the  number  of  differentially  expressed 
(fold  change  ≥2,  p-value  ≤0.05)  genes  on  days  2  and 
7  in  the  hypothalamus  and  striatum.  Methamphetamine 
had  the  greatest  effect  on  gene  expression  on  day  2  in 
both  hypothalamus  and  striatum,  suggesting  that  it  has 
a  substantial  effect  on  feeding  behavior.  Phendimetra-
zine  induced  a  smaller  number  of  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes  on  day  2  in  hypothalamus  than  meth-
amphetamine,  which  concurs  with  a  previous  observat-
ion  that  phendimetrazine  has  a  lower  anorectic  effect 
than  the  other  two  drugs.  However,  phendimetrazine  still

in  the  hypothalamus  and  did  not  showed  significant  gene 
modulation  on  day  2  in  the  striatum,  which  suggests  its 
induction  of  anorexia  differs  mechanistically  from  those  of 
phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine.  Nevertheless,  all 
three  anorectic  drugs  induced  considerable  differential 
gene  expression  in  the  striatum  on  day  7. 
    As  described  previously,  all  three  drugs  showed  best 
efficacy  on  day  2,  suggesting  that  genes  modulated  on 
day  2  in  the  hypothalamus  are  probably  involved  in  ano-
rectic  effects.  In  fact,  a  large  number  of  peptides  and 
neurotransmitters  in  the  hypothalamus  affect  energy 
balance.  These  include  neuropeptide-Y  (NPY),  galanin, 
melanocyte  stimulating  hormone,  and  cocaine  and  am-
phetamine  regulated  transcript  (CART)  (Williams  et al., 
2000).  Moreover,  food  deprivation  is  known  to  increase 
NPY  mRNA  in  the  hypothalamus  of  the  goldfish  and 
(Silverstein  et  al., 
Coho  and  Chinook  salmons 
1998;1999;  Narnaware et al.,  2000),  and  this  effect  can 
be  reversed  by  re-feeding  (Narnaware  and  Peter,  2001). 
Furthermore,  CART  was  found  to  be  a  potent  anorexi-
genic  factor  in  mammals  and  to  be  most  highly  ex-
pressed  in  the  hypothalamus  (Gautvik  et al.,  1996).  In 
addition,  the  actions  of  methamphetamine  have  been  re-
ported  to  be  related  to  hypothalamic  NPY  and  CART 
(Kuo  2003)  and  the  anti-obesity  actions  of  serotonin  may 
be  mediated  by  hypothalamic-NPY  (Dryden et al.,  1996). 
    A  biological  pathway  analysis  of  gene  expression  pro-
files  are  considered  as  one  of  the  most  valuable  tool  in 
providing  key  information  about  the  biological  system 
and  widely  accepted  by  research  community  (Chung et 
al.,  2007;  Lee  et al.,  2008).  To  compare  the  biological 

pathways  induced  by  the  anorectic  agents,  we  classified 
differentially  expressed  genes  by  biological  process.  As 
shown  in  Fig.  2,  even  though  the  numbers  of  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  varied  for  the  three  drugs,  the 
genes  modulated  by  phendimetrazine  and  methamphet-
amine  showed  similar  biological  process  classifications 
on  days  2  and  7  post-administration  in  the  striatum. 
However  sibutramine  revealed  a  quite  different  biological 
pathway.  The  results  of  our  pathway  analysis  strongly 
suggested  that  the  biologic  impact  of  sibutramine  differs 
markedly  from  those  of  phendimetrazine  and  metham-
phetamine.  To  obtain  detailed  information  on  gene  ex-
pression  profiles,  we  further  analyzed  and  compared  in-
dividual  genes  modulated  by  the  three  drugs.

Analysis  of  gene  expression  profiles  and  safety 
considerations

To  identify  genes  commonly  and  specifically  expressed 
by  the  three  drugs,  Venn  diagram  analysis  was  em-
ployed  (Fig.  3,  4).  The  numbers  of  genes  commonly 
modulated  by  the  three  agents  on  day  2  was  16  in  the 
hypothalamus  and  one  in  the  striatum  (Fig.  3).  Since 
highest  anorectic  effects  were  observed  on  day  2  for  all 
three  drugs,  commonly  modulated  genes  on  day  2,  es-
pecially  in  the  hypothalamus,  might  play  a  critical  role  in 
the  anorectic  effect  of  these  drugs  (Table  2). 
    Of  the  genes  listed  in  Table  2,  the  ankyrin  repeat  do-
main  26  (Ankrd26)  gene,  which  is  up-regulated  in  the 
hypothalamus,  revealed  quite  interesting  information. 
The  Ankrd26  gene  is  located  at  10p12.1  in  humans  and

at  chromosome  6  (qF1)  in  the  mouse  (Hahn  et al., 
2006).  Furthermore,  Ankrd26  is  present  in  many  normal 
tissues,  but  little  information  has  been  reported  about 
function  of  this  gene.  However,  recently,  it  was  reported 
that  Ankrd26  gene  mutant  mice  develop  extreme  obe-
sity,  insulin  resistance,  and  an  increase  in  body  size 
(Bera  et al.,  2008),  which  suggests  that  Ankrd26  plays 
a  critical  function  in  controlling  obesity.  In  accordance 
with  this  previous  report,  our  microarray  data  showed 
that  Ankrd26  was  up-regulated  on  day  2  when  anorectic 
effects  were  significant.  Thus,  our  data  supports  the  no-
tion  that  Ankrd26  plays  a  key  role  in  controlling  obesity. 
    In  the  present  study,  only  small  numbers  of  genes 
were  found  to  be  differentially  expressed  in  the  striatum. 
Nevertheless,  phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine 
modulated  the  expressions  of  more  genes  than  sibutr-
amine,  which  again  suggests  that  these  two  drugs  share 
a  common  biological  mechanism. 
    The  numbers  of  genes  commonly  modulated  by  the 
three  drugs  on  day  7  differed  from  that  observed  on 
day  2.  On  day  7,  only  one  gene  was  commonly  ex-
pressed  in  the  hypothalamus,  whereas  77  were  com-
monly  expressed  in  the  striatum.  This  observation 
agrees  well  with  the  previous  observation  on  food  intake 
and  body  weight  as  described  earlier.  As  described 
above,  on  day  7  animals  in  all  three  treatment  groups 
recovered  their  appetites  almost  to  the  control  level. 
This  earlier  observation  was  matched  by  microarray  re-
sults,  which  revealed  no  significant  change  in  gene  ex-

pression  on  day  7  for  phendimetrazine  and  sibutramine 
in  the  hypothalamus,  which  predominantly  controls 
appetite.  In  contrast  with  the  hypothalamus,  microarray 
data  revealed  that  a  significant  number  of  genes  were 
expressionally  modulated  by  the  three  drugs  on  day  7 
in  the  striatum.  By  comparing  lists  of  differentially  ex-
pressed  genes  on  day  7  in  the  striatum,  we  identified  77 
genes  commonly  modulated  by  anorectic  drugs  (Table  3). 
    Of  these  77  common  genes,  we  found  that  six,  which 
were  highly  up-regulated,  were  related  to  the  olfaction 
system,  namely,  olfactory  receptor  1022  (Olfr1022),  ol-
factory  receptor  1330  (Olfr1330),  olfactory  receptor  1134 
(Olfr1134),  vomeronasal  1  receptor  I5  (V1ri5),  vomer-
onasal  1  receptor  A4  (V1ra4),  and  vomeronasal  1  re-
ceptor  C2  (V1rc2).  The  olfaction  system  is  a  sensory  di-
mension  that  plays  an  important  role  in  food  intake 
(Janowitz  et al.,  1953;  Le  Magnen,  1981).  It  also  has 
been  reported  that  this  system  becomes  more  sensitive 
after  fasting  and  less  sensitive  when  satiated  (Aime  et 
al.,  2007;  Apelbaum  et al.,  2005;  Pager  et al.,  1972). 
Accordingly,  in  the  present  study,  olfaction  system 
up-regulation  appeared  to  stimulate  appetite  in  tested 
animals  on  day  7.  Since  the  up-regulation  of  olfactory 
genes  was  greater  on  day  7  than  on  day  2,  and  in-
creased  olfaction  system  activity  appeared  to  account 
for  recovered  appetite  after  prolonged  treatment  with 
anorectics.  The  striatum  has  been  postulated  to  mediate 
the  reinforcing  properties  of  food  and  drugs  of  abuse. 
Furthermore,  the  release  of  dopamine  in  the  striatum  is

to 

known  to  be  implicated  in  the  mechanisms  of  drug  ad-
diction  and  neuroadaptation  (Rompre  and  Wise,  1989; 
Robinson  and  Berridge,  1993).  Accordingly,  our  striatal 
microarray  data  appears  to  reflect  the  importance  of  the 
striatum  in  drug  tolerance. 
    In  summary,  we  investigated  gene  expression  profiles 
in  the  hypothalamus  and  striatum  of  C57BL/6  mice  after 
administering  sibutramine,  phendimetrazine,  or  metham-
phetamine.  We  identified  genes  whose  expressions  were 
highly  modulated  by  these  drugs  both  in  the  hypothal-
amus  and  striatum.  Analyses  of  gene  expressions  in 
these  brain  regions  showed  that  sibutramine  utilizes  a 
biological  pathway  that  differs  from  that  utilized  by 
phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine.  Further  analysis 
of  the  genes  commonly  modulated  by  these  three  drugs 
resulted  in  the  identification  of  Ankrd26,  which  probably 
accounts  for  the  biological  effects  of  these  drugs.  In  ad-
dition,  microarray  data  revealed  the  implication  of  the 
olfaction  systems  in  the  hypothalamus,  which  might  ex-
plain  why  these  anorectic  drugs  tend  to  lack  efficacy  af-
ter  prolonged  use.  Our  findings  demonstrate  that  genes 
related 
the  olfaction  system  were  significantly 
up-regulated  at  7  days  post-administration  as  compared 
with  2  days  post-administration  in  the  striatum,  and 
since  the  appetites  of  drug-treated  animals  completely 
recovered  to  the  control  level  on  day  7,  it  would  appear 
that  olfactory  genes  play  roles  in  the  anorectic  drug 
tolerance.
    Our  microarray  experiments  also  revealed  that  sibutr-
amine  and  the  two  other  anorectics  induced  different 
gene  expressions,  and  suggested  that  the  biologic  path-
way  induced  by  sibutramine  differed  from  those  induced 
by  phendimetrazine  and  methamphetamine.  In  addition, 
sibutramine  induced  gene  expressional  changes  on  day 
2  in  striatum,  a  brain  region  implicated  in  drug  toler-
ance.  Our  microarray  data  revealed  that  sibutramine  al-
so  up-regulated  genes  related  to  olfaction  system  on 
day  7  in  the  striatum  like  phendimetrazine  and  metham-
phetamine.  This  observation  suggests  that  sibutramine 
may  invoke  drug  tolerance  and  that  the  prolonged  use 
of  sibutramine  should  be  viewed  with  caution.
    The  microarray  data  presented  in  this  study  demon-
strates  that  gene  expression  analysis  can  improve  our 
understanding  of  the  biological  effect  of  anorectic  drugs. 
Further  studies  involving  microarray  and  clinical  data  are 
likely  to  provide  profound  information  on  drug  efficacy 
and  safety.
