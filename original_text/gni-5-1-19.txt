Abstract 

In this paper, we provide an overview of statistical models 
for haplotype-based association studies, and summarize 
their features based on the design matrix. We classify the 
design  matrix into the two types:  direct and indirect  For 
these tV\oU  kinds  of matrices,  we  present  and  compare 
characteristics using a simple hypothetical example, and 
a real  data set The motivation behind this study was to 
provide practitioners with an improved understanding, to 
facilitate  the  informed  selection  of  the  appropriate 
haplotype-based model and to improve the interpretability 
of the models.

Introduction 

Several statistical approaches have been developed for 
the analysis of association of singe nudeotide polymorph isms 
(SNPs) and disease phenotypes. However, it has been 
shoiMl that the association tests vvflich  rely on  SNPs may 
loose power due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the 
tested SN Ps (Epstein and Satten, 2003). To overcome this 
problem,  alternative  approaches  based  on  haplotypes 
have been developed. Haplotypes are specific combinations 
of alleles at several loci on the same chromosome. They 
can  sometimes  provide  greater  analytical  power  than 
single-marker analysis  for  genetic association  studies. 
This is because haplotypes are inherited together in the 
majority  of  cases,  and

2004).  Conversely, haplotype-based statistical analysis 
has a weakness  since haplotypes are  often  not directly

observable. Hence, haplotypes and their frequencies are 
inferred by statistical methods such  as the Expectation(cid:173)
Maximization  (EM)  algorithm  (Dempster  et  a/.,  1977; 
Excoffier  and  Slatkin,  1995)  or the  Bayesian  method 
(Stephens eta/., 2001;  Lin  eta/., 2002). 

V\lithin the frameV\oUrk of the generalized linear model 
(GLM), the haplotype effect on  traits can  be  statistically 
described and tested.  The model can  be expressed  as 
E(Y) = t ·1 (X/3),  vvhere  Y denotes the trait,  X represents 
the haplotypes that are  coded  into the  design matrix, j3 
denotes the effects of haplotype, and tis a function that 
generalizes the usual linear regression  such  as logistic 
regression  in  the  case-control  study.  Several  solutions 
have  been  proposed  to  account  for  the  haplotype 
ambiguity  problem  in  the  general  form  of  a  GLM. 
However, since each method has its ovvn  merits, it is not 
easy for  researchers  to  choose  the  most  appropriate 
model  to  use  for  a  given  situation.  Furthermore,  the 
interpretation  of the  result  is  not  simple  and  may vary 
from method to method. Confusion and misinterpretation 
of the results can  often occur. 

In this paper, we review regression models for haplotype 
based association studies and summarize their features 
focused on the design matrices. We classify the haplotype 
design matrices into direct and indirect types, and for these 
we present and  compare  characteristics  vvith  a simple 
hypothetical  example.  We then  apply the two  types  of 
statistical models to a real  data set taken from a genetic 
study undertaken by the CDC Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
Research Group (http://vvvvw.cdc.gov/nciod/ diseases/cfsf). 

Regression models for haplotypes 

In order to apply our statistical analysis, we shall designate 
Yas a random variable ofthe binary trait representing the 
disease status vvith  a realization of either 0 or 1 depending 
on  vvhether the  subject is  a control  or a  genuine case, 
respectively. Let (h,  h1) be a random variable that denotes 
the pair of haplotypes for each individual, i=j or i t.j. Let H 
={h1, h2, ... , hp}be a set ofhaplotypes. Then, the maximum 
number  of possible  haplotypes  is  2m,  vvhere  m  is  the 
number of SNPs. 

In  association  studies,  the  main  interest  lies  in 
estimating the effects of Hon Y. We review the statistical 
models for the haplotype based association  studies and 
compare their characteristics vvhile focusing on the design

matrices and their implications. To explain the differences 
between  the  design  matrices,  we  consider  a  simple 
hypothetical example of five individuals. Table 1 shows 
theirhaplotypes and probabilities. Individuals Y1,  Y3,  and 
Y4  have  unambiguous haplotypes,  vvhile  the  remaining 
individuals have ambiguous haplotypes.  We group  the 
haplotype design  matrices into direct and indirect types. 
The  direct type uses the  haplotype  probabilities  in  the 
design  matrix  and  models  E(Y)  directly  in  tenns  of 
haplotype probabilities,  vvhile the indirect type uses the 
number of copies of haplotypes.

contributions  of ambiguous  pairs  of haplotypes  in  the 
design matrix are based on the half of the probabilities of 
the  haplotype  pairs  that  are  estimated  by  the  EM 
algorithm  or other  statistical  inference  methods.  DDM 
relates  the  predictors based  on  haplotype  probabilities 
with  the trait values.  Zaykin  eta/. (2002) proposed the 
Haplotype  Trend  Regression  (HTR)  model  using  the 
direct  design  matrix.  HTR  is  a  regression  model  that 
relates haplotype probabilities with disease phenotypes. 
In Table 2we present DDM data using a hypothetical exarrple. 

Direct Design Matrix (DDM) 
The direct type  of design  matrix relies on  the  estimated 
haplotype probabilities (proportions).  The  contributions 
of the haplotypes are weighted using these probabilities, 
and  unambiguous  pairs  of haplotypes  are  coded  1 for 
the  homozygous and  0.5 for each  of the  heterozygous 
haplotypes.  All  other haplotypes  are  coded  as  0.  The

are coded as 2forthe homozygous haplotypes, and 1 for

The model is fitted by a weighted estimation method using 
the haplotype pair probability as weight. The model using 
the indirect design  matrix assumes the additive effect of 
the haplotypes, and is a special case ofthe weighted GLM. 
VVe  can also account for dominant or recessive haplotype 
effects within this framework. This matrix has been used 
previously  in  association  studies  (Lake  et  a/.,  2003; 
Epstein and Satten, 2003; Zhao eta/., 2003). In table 2we 
present IDM  data using a hypothetical example,  and  in 
Table 3 we summarize the proposed features. 

Matrices  using  the  'two  type'  desig1  can  cause 
problems during statistical modeling. In  DDM, the sum of 
haplotypesforone individual is 1, vvhile in  IDM the sum of 
haplotypes  for  one  raw  is  2.  Since  haplotypes  are 
reconstructed from genotype data, there are always tV\oU 
haplotypes. In this case, a multicollinearity problem occurs 
during model fitting.  Multicollinearity refers to any linear 
relationship  among  covariates  in  linear models.  In  the 
presence  of  multicollinearity,  the  estimation  of  model 
parameters becomes unstable. There are tvvu approaches 
available to resolve this problem. One approach is to fit the 
model  vvithout an  intercept. The second  approach  is to 
exclude one haplotype in  order to reduce the rank of the 
design  matrix.  The  excluded  haplotype  is  called  the 
baseline  haplotype.  The  effect  of  other  haplotypes 
represents  the  relative  risk  compared  to  the  baseline 
haplotype. The most frequent haplotype is commonly used 
as  a baseline. 

Firstly,  let us consider the test  based on  the models 
vvithout an intercept. In this case, we can test the individual 
f!h  haplotype effect using the null  hypothesis Ho  :{3"  =  o. 
The significance of this individual haplotype implies that 
those vvtlo  have this  haplotype have  a higher risk than 
those vvho  do not have this  haplotype,  vvtlen{3"  >  o.  For 
risk  can  be 
the 
represented by the odds ratios.  In  addition, we can  test 
the  global  haplotype  effects  using  the  null  hypothesis 
that  all  elements of {3  are zero,  that  is,  Ho  : f3  =  o vvhich 
implies no haplotype effects on  the trait.

Next,  consider  the  test  based  on  the  model  vvhich 
excludes  a  baseline  haplotype.  We  can 
test  the 
individual  relative  haplotype  effect  by testing  the  null 
hypothesis Ho  : f3t  =  o. The significance of this individual 
haplotype  implies  that  those  vvho  have  this  haplotype 
have  a  higher  risk than  those  vvho  have  the  baseline 
haplotype,  vvflen  {3"  >  o.  In  addition, we can  test for the 
global  effects  of haplotypes  using  the  null  hypothesis 
that  all  elements  of {3  are zero.  The significance  of the 
test  result  implies  that  there  are  some  differences 
among the effects of the haplotypes on the trait. 

The meaning of the global test for the model without

an  intercept is different from that for the model  vvith  an 
intercept.  Therefore,  the  global  test  results  need to be 
interpreted carefully.  For the model without an  intercept, 
the  test  for  the  hypothesis  Ho  : {31  -

equivalent  to  the  global  test  for  the  model  with  an

The interpretation  of the test results for each  design 
matrix is presented in table 3.  It also summarizes the list 
and the important features oft he software programs that 
implement  these  models.  These  features  include  test 
statistics,  trait types,  likelihood,  the handling ability for 
environmental  covariates  and  missing  observations, 
and a test for the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium  (HWE). 

Example 
In this section, we compare characteristics of two design 
matrices  and  present  the  interpretation  of  haplotype 
effects  using a  dataset from  the  CDC Chronic  Fatigue 
Syndrome  Research  Group  (http://vvvvw.cdc.gov/nciod/ 
diseases/cfsD. In this example, we used a CFS group as 
the  case  study (55  subjects)  and  a non-fatigued  group 
as  the  control  (54  subjects).  We analyzed three  SNPs, 
rs258750,  rs6188,  and  rs852977  in  the  NR3C1  gene 
vvhich  are  knovvn 
to  associate  with  CFS  (Online 
Mendelian  Inheritance in  Man  (OMIM)).  The estimated 
haplotype frequencies by the EM algorithm are shovvn in 
table 4.  We did not consider haplotype 7,  vvhich  has an 
estimated frequency of zero. 

We fit the logistic regression models, vvith and without 
an  intercept, using two types of design matrices. Lake et 
a/.  (2003) mentioned that haplotype frequencies should 
be  at  least  5%  to  avoid  biased  estimations  of  the 
regression  parameters.  For this reason, the haplotypes 
with frequencies below0.05 were pooled together into a 
rare haplotype group, denoted by h,. Tables 5 shows the 
results  of the model fit obtained using SAS version  9.1 
(SAS Institute Inc.,  Cary, NC, USA) with  both  DDM and 
IDM.  For  models  vvithout  an 
intercept  using  both 
matrices, haplotypes 4 and 5 had statistically significant 
effects at the 5% confidence level, vvhile all other effects 
were not significant. The global test yielded a significant

result with 4 degrees of freedom (df), implying that there 
is at least one significant individual haplotype effect. 

For models with  an  intercept, haplotype 4 was  used 
as  a baseline haplotype and in this case only haplotype 
5 showed  a significant  result.  The  global  test yielded  a 
significant result with  3 df,  implying that there is at least 
one  individual  haplotype  that  showed  a  significantly 
different effect from the  baseline haplotype 4.  If we  are 
interested  in  the  effects  of a  specific  haplotype  on  a 
disease, the models that do not have an  intercept should 
be  applied.  On  the  other hand,  if we  are  interested  in 
comparing  the  relative  effects  of a  haplotype  with  the 
baseline  haplotype,  the  models  that have  an  intercept 
are recommended. 

Discussion 
In  this  paper  we  have  discussed  issues  regarding 
modeling for haplotype association using different design 
matrices,  and we  have presented the features  of each 
method  within  the  GLM  framework.  VVe  classified  the 
haplotype design matrices into a direct type and an  indirect 
type.  Additionally,  we  considered the  models  with  and 
vvithout an intercept. The direct type of design matrix uses 
the haplotype probabilities and models their effect directly, 
vvhile  the  indirect  type  uses  the  number  of  copies  of 
haplotypes. VVe  applied these methods to a dataset from 

the CDC's Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Research  Group. 
The elements ofthe tV\oU  design matrices are different, as 
are the values ofthe parameter estimate and the standard 
error.  For the logistic regression  model,  the  parameter 
estimate can be represented by the odds ratios. As a result, 
the same haplotype has a different odds ratio according 
to the choice of design matrices. AIC values are the same 
for both models vvith  and vvithout an  intercept. LR statistics 
also have similar values for both models. However, vvhen 
the intercept is included in the model, the dfofthe global 
test increases. This increase relates to the power of the 
test; namely, the power ofthe test is inversely proportional 
to the numerical value of the degrees of freedom. 

Modeling with DDM relies on the estimated proportions 
of  the  haplotypes.  However,  this  approach  may  not 
account for the variation due to the haplotype estimation. 
It has been reported that this method may produce biased 
and inefficient estimation of regression parameters vvhen 
the effect sizes are large or haplotype uncertainty is high 
(Lin  eta/., 2005). DDM does not allawfor dominant and 
recessive effects ofhaplotypes, vvhile IDM allows for these 
genetic models.  However,  it  has  also  been  shovvn  that 
departure from HVVE can  cause severe biases in modeling 
with  IDM (Satten  and  Epstein,  2004). 

In  this  paper,  we  have  reviewed  and  compared  the 
characteristics of commonly used models for haplotype 
based association studies. VVe have classified the models 

Regression Models for Haplotype-Based Association studies  23 

into DDM and IDM types. Parameter interpretations of the 
existence of an  intercept were found to be quite different. 
As  shovvn  in  Table  3,  numerous  software  applications 
have  been  developed  to  assist  with  haplotype  based 
association studies. Unfortunately, the output from these 
programs  is  not  easy  to  interpret.  This  can  cause 
misinterpretation among users, and lead them to drawthe 
vvrong  conclusions about the effects of haplotypes. The 
main  motivation of this study was to provide practioners 
with  a better insight to help them choose an  appropriate 
model,  and improve the  interpretability of such  models. 
OJr  empirical  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the 
significant  haplotypes  can  differ  from  model  to  model 
depending on the design matrix. Thus, researchers must 
choose an  appropriate model according to their analysis 
purpose and interpret the results accordingly.
