We  have  previously  reported  that  NS-398,  a  cyclooxygenase-2  (COX-2)–selective  inhibitor,  inhibited  replicative  cellular 
senescence in human dermal fibroblasts and skin aging in hairless mice. In contrast, celecoxib, another COX-2–selective 
inhibitor, and aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, accelerated the senescence and aging. To figure out causal factors for the 
senescence-modulating effect of the inhibitors, we here performed cDNA microarray experiment and subsequent Gene Set 
Enrichment Analysis. The data showed that several senescence-related gene sets were regulated by the inhibitor treatment. 

NS-398 up-regulated gene sets involved in the tumor necrosis factor β receptor pathway and the fructose and mannose 

metabolism, whereas it down-regulated a gene set involved in protein secretion. Celecoxib up-regulated gene sets involved 
in G2M checkpoint and E2F targets. Aspirin up-regulated the gene set involved in protein secretion, and down-regulated 
gene sets involved in RNA transcription. These results suggest that COX inhibitors modulate cellular senescence by different 
mechanisms and will provide useful information to understand senescence-modulating mechanisms of COX inhibitors.

Introduction

Prostaglandin  endoperoxide  synthase,  also  called  as 
cyclooxygenase (COX), is an enzyme converting arachidonic 
acid  to  prostaglandin  H2  (PGH2).  PGH2  is  a  common 
precursor for prostanoid biosynthesis such as PGD2, PGE2, 
PGF2α, PGI2, and thromboxane A2. These prostanoids are 
known to be important chemical mediators for inflammation 
as  well  as  other  biological  processes  [1].  There  are  two 
isoforms  of  COX.  COX-1  (PTGS1)  is  expressed  constitu-
tively  in  most  cells  and  responsible  for  basal  level  of 
prostanoid  biosynthesis.  COX-2  (PTGS2)  is  induced  by 
various  stimuli  such  as  bacterial  endotoxins,  cytokines, 
genotoxic agents, growth factors, or oncogene products [2, 3].
Most  non-steroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  are  COX 
inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the COX catalytic activity by 
occupying  the  active  site  of  COX.  Aspirin,  ibuprofen,  or 

flurbiprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor, which inhibits 
both  COX-1  and  COX-2  catalytic  activity.  In  contrast, 
NS-398,  celecoxib,  or  nimesulide  is  a  selective  COX-2 
inhibitor, which inhibits COX-2 catalytic activity specifically 
[3, 4].

The mechanism of aging has not been fully understood. 
However, it has been proposed that the pro-inflammatory 
catalytic activity of COX-2 is a causal factor for aging. The 
hypothesis  proposes  that  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS) 
generated in the process of normal metabolism or inflam-
mation activate the transcription factor nuclear factor κB 
(NF-κB).  NF-κB  increases  the  transcription  of  pro- 
inflammatory target genes such as COX-2, which in turn 
stabilizes a chronic inflammatory circuit by generating ROS. 
This chronic inflammation causes tissue damage and aging 
[5].

If the pro-inflammatory catalytic activity of COX-2 is a 
causal factor for aging, COX-2 inhibitors should conceivably

inhibit aging. In this context, we have previously examined 
the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on aging both in the replicative 
cellular  senescence  model  of  human  dermal  fibroblasts 
(HDFs)  and  in  the  intrinsic  skin  aging  model  of  hairless 
mice.  We  observed  that  among  three  selective  COX-2 
inhibitors  studied,  only  NS-398  inhibited  the  cellular 
senescence  whereas  celecoxib  and  nimesulide  accelerated 
the  senescence.  In  addition,  three  non-selective  COX 
inhibitors  including  aspirin,  ibuprofen,  and  flurbiprofen 
accelerated the senescence [6]. Also, we observed that only 
NS-398 inhibited the skin aging while celecoxib and aspirin 
accelerated the skin aging in hairless mice [3]. These studies 
strongly suggest that the pro-inflammatory catalytic activity 
of  COX-2  is  not  a  causal  factor  for  aging  and  that  the 
aging-modulating effect of COX inhibitors is attributable to 
a catalytic activity–independent mechanism.
In an attempt to figure out underlying mechanisms by 
which COX inhibitors modulate aging, we here performed 
cDNA  microarray  experiment  and  subsequent  Gene  Set 
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in HDFs treated with three 
COX inhibitors, NS-398, celecoxib, and aspirin.

Methods
Materials and cell culture

NS-398  and  aspirin  were  purchased  from  Cayman 
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Celecoxib was a generous 
gift from Dr. S.V. Yim (Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea). 
HDFs,  isolated  from  foreskin  [7],  were  cultured  in 
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal 
bovine  serum  (Life  Technologies,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA), 
penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptomycin (100 units/mL) 
in a 5% CO2 incubator [6].

RNA isolation

Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  HDFs  with  Trizol  (Life 
Technologies), purified with the addition of chloroform, and 
precipitated  with  the  addition  of  isopropanol.  The  RNA 
concentration  was  determined  by  spectrophotometer  and 
the quality of RNA was evaluated by OD 260/280 ratio and 
gel electrophoresis [8].

cDNA microarray experiment

The following procedures were carried out by Macrogen Co. 
(Seoul, Korea). Five hundred fifty nanograms of total RNA was 
reverse-transcribed to cDNA using a T7 oligo(dT) primer. 
Second-strand cDNA was synthesized, in vitro transcribed, 
and labeled with biotin-NTP. After purification, 750 ng of 
labeled cRNA was hybridized to Illumina Human HT12 v.4 
bead array (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) for 16-18 h at 
58oC.  The  array  signal  was  detected  by  using  Amersham 
fluorolink  streptavidin-Cy3  (GE  Healthcare  Bio-Sciences, 
Little Chalfont, UK). Arrays were scanned with an Illumina 
bead array Reader confocal scanner. Array data were filtered 
by detection p-value ＜ 0.05 (similar to signal to noise). The 
average signal values of filtered genes were transformed by 
logarithm and normalized by the quantile method [8].

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

The beta version of GSEA software and MSigDB 5.2 were 
downloaded  from  the  Broad  Institute  (http://software. 
broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). GSEA was carried out as 
described  previously  [9].  Enrichment  of  gene  sets  was 
considered statistically significant if the normalized p-value 
was ＜ 0.01 and the false discovery rate (FDR) was ＜ 0.20.

Results
Treatment of HDFs with COX inhibitors

We  have  previously  shown  that  among  COX  inhibitors 
studied, NS-398, a COX-2-selective inhibitor, inhibited rep-
licative cellular senescence in HDFs as well as skin aging in 
hairless mice, whereas celecoxib, another COX-2-selective 
inhibitor, and aspirin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, acce-
lerated the senescence and aging. At that time, we treated 
cells or skin with inhibitors every day for more than a month 
(Table 1) [3, 6].

To figure out causal factors for the senescence-modulating 
effect  of  the  inhibitors,  we  treated  HDFs  with  NS-398, 
celecoxib,  aspirin,  or  dimethyl  sulfoxide  (DMSO)  (the 
vehicle) every day for only 3 days in this study. The IC50 
values have been reported for recombinant human COX-1 
and  COX-2  of  NS-398  and  celecoxib  [10,  11],  and  for 
recombinant ovine COX-1 and COX-2 of aspirin [12]. In the

case of NS-398 and celecoxib, we used approximately 10-fold 
higher  concentration  of  IC50  to  inhibit  COX-2  catalytic 
activity sufficiently. NS-398 and celecoxib showed no acute 
cellular toxicity at this concentration. In the case of aspirin, 
however, we used IC50 because 10-fold higher concentration 
caused acute cellular toxicity (Table 1) [6].

DNA microarray and GSEA

We performed cDNA microarray experiment using RNA 
extracted from the drug-treated HDFs. Among 47,319 probe 
sets, 20,271 probe sets passed the criteria of the detection 
p-value ＜ 0.05. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis 
showed that drug-treated cells were well segregated in the 
order of DMSO, NS-398, celecoxib, and aspirin (Fig. 1).

To  figure  out  underlying  mechanisms  by  which  COX 
inhibitors modulate senescence, we performed GSEA using 
17,777  probe  sets  having  all  information  including  gene 
symbols  and  gene  descriptions.  We  sorted  the  data  sets 
based on the value of (INS-398 – IDMSO) for the comparison of 

Fig. 1. Segregation between the drug-treated HDFs. Unsupervised
hierarchical  cluster  analysis  was  done  between  four  drug-treated 
HDFs using 20,271 probe sets with the detection p-value  ＜ 0.05.

NS-398 versus DMSO; the value of (ICelecoxib – IDMSO) for the 
comparison  of  celecoxib  versus  DMSO;  and  the  value  of 
(IAspirin – IDMSO) for the comparison of aspirin versus DMSO to 
rank the data sets as described previously [9].
We then tested (1) the Hallmark gene sets (H); (2) gene 
sets regulating canonical pathways−i.e., Biocarta gene sets 
(C2:CP:BIOCARTA),  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and 
Genomes (KEGG) gene sets (C2:CP:KEGG), and Reactome 
gene sets (C2:CP:REACTOME); and (3) gene ontology gene 
sets−i.e.,  biological  process  gene  sets  (G5:BP),  cellular 
component gene sets (G5:CC), and molecular function gene 
sets (G5:MF).

NS-398 versus DMSO
The analysis of NS-398 versus DMSO showed that two 
gene sets are enriched in NS-398–treated HDFs as compared 
with DMSO-treated HDFs. These gene sets consist of genes 
regulating the tumor necrosis factor beta receptor (TNFR2) 
pathway and the fructose and mannose metabolism (Table 2, 
Fig. 2A). Enriched genes in each pathway were shown in 
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Figs. 1 
and 2.
On  the  other  hand,  four  gene  sets  were  enriched  in 
DMSO-treated  HDFs  as  compared  with  NS-398–treated 
HDFs: genes down-regulated in response to ultraviolet (UV) 
radiation, and genes regulating the protein secretion, the 
trefoil  factor  pathway  and  the  receptor-regulated  Smads 
(R-SMAD) binding (Table 3, Fig. 2B). Enriched genes in each 
gene set were shown in Supplementary Tables 3–6.
Celecoxib versus DMSO

The analysis of celecoxib versus DMSO showed that four 
gene  sets  were  enriched  in  celecoxib-treated  HDFs  as 
compared  with  DMSO-treated  HDFs.  These  gene  sets 
consist  of  genes  involved  in  the  G2M  checkpoint,  E2F 
targets,  γ tubulin  complex  and  the  four  way  junction 
(Holliday junction) DNA binding (Table 4, Fig. 3A). Enri-
ched genes in each gene set were shown in Supplementary 
Tables 7–10.
On  the  other  hand,  one  gene  set  was  enriched  in 
DMSO-treated  HDFs  as  compared  with  celecoxib-treated

HDFs: genes regulating prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, 
and cardiomyopathy (Table 7). In addition, 34 gene sets of 
C5:BP, three gene sets of C5:CC and five gene sets of C5:MF 
were  enriched  in  DMSO-treated  HDFs  as compared  with 
aspirin-treated  HDFs.  These  gene  sets  consist  of  genes 
involved in embryonic development, negative regulation of 
protein localization to plasma membrane, DNA-dependent 
RNA transcription, cell differentiation, glutamate receptor 
binding, or Smad binding (Tables 7 and 8, Fig. 4B). Of note, 
the gene set involved in platelet aggregation was enriched in 
DMSO-treated  HDFs  as  compared  with  aspirin-treated 
HDFs (Table 8, FDR, 0.179). Enriched genes in representative 
gene sets were shown in Supplementary Tables 16–22.

Discussion

Our data showed that NS-398 treatment up-regulated the 
gene set involved in the TNFR2 pathway (Table 2, Fig. 2A, 
Supplementary  Table  1).  This  pathway  is  well  known  to 
activate  the  NF-κB  signaling  that  mediates  cell  prolife-
ration,  anti-apoptosis,  inflammation,  differentiation,  or 
development (Supplementary Fig. 1) [13]. NF-κB, a trans-
cription factor, has been reported to regulate cellular sene-
scence  though its role  in  the senescence  is controversial. 
Overexpression of c-Rel resulted in premature senescence in 
normal human keratinocytes [14]. On the contrary, mouse 
embryonic fibroblasts from NF-κB1 knockout mice showed

enhanced  cellular  senescence  [15].  In  addition,  siRNA 
against NF-κB2 or RelB induced premature senescence in 
HDFs  in  a  p53-dependent  manner  [16].  These  studies 
suggest that the anti-senescent effect of NS-398 might be 
attributable to a regulation of NF-κB signaling.

NS-398 treatment also up-regulated the gene set involved in 
the fructose and mannose metabolism (Table 2, Supplementary 
Table 2). This metabolic pathway leads to enhanced glycolysis 
and N-glycan biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. 2). Alterations 
of  glucose  metabolism  have  been  reported  in  cellular 
senescence  though  the  data  is  conflicting.  In  human 
mammary epithelial cells, B-Raf–induced premature senescence 
was  associated  with  a  reduction  of  glucose  uptake,  and 

overexpression  of  hexokinase  2  prevented  the  oncogene- 
induced  senescence  [17].  On  the  contrary,  glucose  con-
sumption  and  hexokinase  activity  were  increased  in 
senescent HDFs as compared to young HDFs [18]. These 
studies suggest that NS-398 might delay cellular senescence 
via regulation of glycolysis.

It  is  intriguing  that  the  gene  set  involved  in  protein 
secretion  is  down-regulated  by  NS-398  treatment  but  is 
up-regulated by aspirin treatment (Tables 3 and 6, Figs. 2B 
and  4A,  Supplementary  Tables  4  and  12).  It  has  been 
reported  that  cellular  senescence  is  accompanied  by  an 
increase in the secretion of intercellular signaling molecules 
including  interleukins,  chemokines,  growth  factors,  pro-

teases,  and  extracellular  matrix  proteins  [19,  20].  For 
example, production of interleukin-1, -6, chemokine (C-C 
motif)  ligand-1,  -2,  -3,  -7,  -8,  -12,  -13,  -16,  -20,  -26, 
chemokine  (C-X-C  motif)  ligand-1,  -2,  -4,  -5,  -6,  -8, 
insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, 
connective  tissue  growth  factor,  granulocyte-macrophage 
colony-stimulating  factor,  granulocyte  colony  stimulating 
factor,  matrix  metalloproteinase-1,  -3,  -10,  plasminogen 
activator inhibitor 1, or fibronectin increased in senescent 
HDFs  as  compared  to  in  young  HDFs  [21].  Ectopic 
expression  of  chemokine  receptors  such  as  CXCR1  or 
CXCR2  induced  premature  senescence  in  HDFs  [22]. 
Extracellular matrix from young HDFs restored senescent 
HDFs to an apparently youthful state [23]. In addition, there 

is a report that p16-induced senescence is accompanied by 
an increase in the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in 
mouse and human pancreatic beta cells [24]. These studies 
suggest  that  regulation  of  protein  secretion  might  be  an 
important common mechanism by which NS-398 delays but 
aspirin accelerates cellular senescence.

In  addition  to  the  up-regulation  of  protein  secretion, 
aspirin down-regulated gene sets involved in DNA-dependent 
RNA transcription (Table 7, FDR, 0.062 and 0.088; Table 8, 
FDR,  0.061  and  0.197;  Fig.  4B).  Compatible  with  these 
results,  a  cDNA  microarray  study  reported  that  genes 
involved in transcription were down-regulated specifically 
during  senescence  in  HDFs  [25].  In  addition,  there  is  a 
report  that  RNA  transcription  was  decreased  in  aged  rat

brain  as  compared  to in  young rat  brain  [26].  Therefore, 
aspirin  might  accelerate  cellular  senescence  by  down- 
regulation of DNA-dependent RNA transcription.

It is well known that aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation 
and thereby thrombus formation [27]. Consistent with this, 
our  data  showed  that  the  gene  set  involved  in  platelet 
aggregation was down-regulated by aspirin treatment (Table 
8, FDR, 0.179). 

Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are categorized 
into two families, that is, the Ink4 family including p15, p16, 
p18, and p19, and the Cip/Kip family including p21, p27, and 
p57. It has been reported that these CKIs are actively involved 
in cellular senescence. For example, ectopic expression of 
p15, p16, p19, p21, or p27 was reported to induce premature 
senescence  in  HDFs  [28,  29].  According  to  our  data, 
celecoxib  treatment  up-regulated  gene  sets  relating  G2M 
checkpoint and E2F targets (Table 4, Fig. 3A). In addition, 
CDKN1B  encoding  p27  and  CDKN2C  encoding  p18  were 
enriched in both gene sets (Supplementary Table 7, Running 
enrichment  score  [ES],  0.410  and  0.274;  Supplementary 
Table 8, Running ES, 0.299 and 0.193). These data suggest 
that celecoxib might accelerate cellular senescence through 
up-regulation of CKIs.

Collectively,  our  results  suggest  that  COX  inhibitors 
modulate  cellular  senescence  by  different  mechanisms 
though they have the anti-catalytic activity commonly. We 
believe  that  our  study  will  provide  useful  information  to 
understand  senescence-modulating  mechanisms  of  COX 
inhibitors.
