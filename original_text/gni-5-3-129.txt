Abstract 
arraylmpute is a software for exploratory analysis of missing 
data and imputation of missing values in microarray data. 
It  also  provides a  comparative analysis of the  imputed 
values obtained from various imputation methods. Thus, 
it allows the users to choose an  appropriate imputation 
method for microarray data. It is built on Rand provides 
a user-friendly graphical interface. Therefore, the users 
can  easily use arraylmpute to explore,  estimate missing 
data, and compare imputation methods for further analysis. 

Keywords:  imputation, microarray data,  missing data 

Introduction 
Microarray  experiments  generate  data  sets  for  the 
expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously. 
However,  these  experiments  often  produce  missing 
values due to various reasons such as scratches on the 
chip,  spotting  problem,  and the presence of dust.  Most 
statistical methods for analyzing microarray data cannot be 
applied when the data contain missing values. Therefore, 
the  missing values  have to  be  estimated  before further 
analysis of the microarray data. 

Many imputation methods for the estimation of missing 
values have been developed, such as weighted k-nearest 
neighbors imputation  (kNN,  Troyanskaya  et at.,  2002), 
Bayesian principal component analysis (BPCA, Oba et at., 
2003),  local  least  squares  imputation  (LLS,  Kim  et at., 
2004), and robust least squares imputation with principal 
components (RLSP, Yoon et at.,  2006). 

Even though many sophisticated imputation methods 

are currently available, the performanceof the proposed 
imputation method mainly depends on the characteristics 
of the missing data. Further, it has been shown that even 
a small number of poorly estimated missing values might 
produce misleading results (Wang et at., 2006). Therefore, 
it is important to use an appropriate imputation method. 
arraylmputehas been developed to provide an exploratory 
analysis  of missing  data  and  the  imputation  of missing 
values by various imputation methods. Further, it provides 
a comparative analysis of the imputed values to let the user 
choose an appropriate imputation method for the data. The 
advantage  of arraylmpute  is  its  user-friendly  graphical 
interface.  Therefore,  the  users  can  easily  perform  an 
analysis for the missing data by a simple click ofthe mouse. 

Exploratory Analysis of Missing Data 
arraylmpute provides various techniques to explore the 
missing data. It calculates missing rates for each chip and 
provides a  bar chart to compare the chip-wise  missing 
rates (Fig. 1 a). Further, it calculates the missing rates for 
each gene and provides the distribution of the gene-wise 
missing rates (Fig.  1 b). 

arraylmpute  also  provides  a  heat  map  to  display 
missing  patterns.  First,  arraylmpute  provides  a  global 
missing pattern plot, where the x-axis represents chips, 
and they-axis represents genes (Fig. 1c). The red spots 
represent the missing values. From this map, we can easily 
find the missing patterns. In chip X04T, the missing values 
tend to cluster and produce several blocks. arraylmpute 
also produces an individual heat map for each chip, where 
the x and y-axes represent the two-dimensional location 
of the gene in the chip.  Fig.  1 d and 1 e show the missing 
patterns for the chips X01 T and X04T, respectively. In Fig. 
1d,  there  are  no  specific  patterns  of red  spots,  which 
suggests that the missing pattern of X01T is random. On 
the other hand, in  Fig.  1e, most red spots are located in 
the right lower corner. In this case, experimenters need to 
check the right lower corner of this chip for any possible 
artifacts of the chip.

several  imputation  methods  such  as  average  impute 
(AVE,  Feten eta/, 2005),  kNN,  LLS,  RLSP,  and  BPCA. 
Therefore,  the users can  impute the missing values  by 
these  methods  and  simultaneously  compare  them  to 
choose an appropriate imputation method. In addition, the 
users can upload their own imputed values from their newly 
developed imputation method and compare them with the 
imputed values provided by arraylmpute. 

For an  overall  comparison,  arraylmpute  provides  a 

scatter plot for each pair of the imputed values as well as 
the corresponding p-value of the pairwise t-test (Fig. 2a). 
arraylmpute also provides a profile plot to compare the 
imputed values for each gene (Fig.  2b). 

In order to compare imputation methods, arraylmpute 
generates  missing  observations  randomly  and  then 
imputes the missing observations using all the imputation 
methods available. arraylmpute computes the normalized 
root mean squared errors (NRMSE, Oba et at., 2003) for

each imputation method by comparing the imputed values 
with the true values (Fig. 3). Even though NRMSE is the 
most  commonly  used  measure  for  performance  of 
imputation, NRMSE is sensitive to outliers. To overcome 
this  limitation,  arraylmpute  provides  another  measure 
based on voting.  For each gene, arraylmpute votes the 
imputation  method  that  has  the  smallest  absolute 
difference  between  the  imputed  values  and  the  true 
observed  values.  One  gene  is  allowed  to vote for one 
imputation method. 

arraylmpute  also  provides  a  test  of  significant 
differences between  imputation  methods based  on  the 
mixed effect model (Fig. 3) in which imputation method is 
treated  as  a  fixed  effect.  All  imputation  methods  in 
arraylmputeare developed under the missing at random 
(MAR)  assumption.  However,  the  missing  patterns  of 
some  chips  may  be  missing  not  at  random  (MNAR) 
(Fig.1 c),  and  they  should  be  treated  in  different  ways 
(Scheel eta/., 2005). arraylmpute will be a useful tool to 
check whether the missing pattern is MAR or MNAR. 

Implementation 

This software runs on R with a couple of R packages-RGtk2 
and cairoDevice-for graphical user interface.
