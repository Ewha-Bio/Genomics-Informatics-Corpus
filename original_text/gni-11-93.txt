The prediction of externally visible characteristics from DNA has been studied for forensic genetics over the last few years. 
Externally visible characteristics include hair, skin, and eye color, height, and facial morphology, which have high heritability. 
Recent studies using genome-wide association analysis have identified genes and variations that correlate with human visible 
phenotypes  and  developed  phenotype  prediction  programs.  However,  most  prediction  models  were  constructed  and 
validated based on genotype and phenotype information on Europeans. Therefore, we need to validate prediction models in 
diverse ethnic populations. In this study, we selected potentially useful variations for forensic science that are associated with 
hair and eye color, iris pattern, and facial morphology, based on previous studies, and analyzed their frequencies in 1,920 
Koreans. Among 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 10 SNPs were polymorphic, 6 SNPs were very rare (minor allele 
frequency < 0.005), and 4 SNPs were monomorphic in the Korean population. Even though the usability of these SNPs 
should be verified by an association study in Koreans, this study provides 10 potential SNP markers for forensic science for 
externally visible characteristics in the Korean population.

Introduction

DNA  genotyping has  been used in forensic science for 
over 30 years for human identification by using short tandem 
repeat  (STR)  markers,  which  are  highly  polymorphic  va-
riants  [1].  Recently,  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs) have also been used for forensic marker, because they 
may provide better profiling from degraded DNA samples 
than STRs and do not involve repetitive sequences that may 
make  stutter  artifacts,  which  complicates  STR  profiling 
interpretation [2, 3]. SNPs for forensic analyses can be used 
for  human  identification,  kinship  analysis,  inferring  bio-
geographic ancestry, and estimating appearance traits [4].

In general, forensic DNA profiling is used for identifying 
persons  compared  with  profiles  of  known  suspects  or 
missing persons included in a DNA database. However, in 
the case of absent information on felons or missing persons 
in the DNA profile database, it is helpful to predict unknown 
persons with DNA markers [5]. The prediction of externally 
visible characteristics (EVCs) from DNA has been studied 
for forensic genetics over the last few years [5-7]. The EVCs 

include  hair,  skin  and  eye  color,  height,  and  facial  mor-
phology, which have high heritability [8-10]. 

The genome-wide association study (GWAS), a linkage 
analysis and candidate gene study, has been used to identify 
genetic  variants influencing  such EVCs.  Variations in the 
MC1R gene have been associated with red hair [11]. The red 
hair  prediction  method,  based  on  a  combination  of  non-
synonymous  SNPs  in  MC1R,  was  already  developed  for 
forensic  science  more  than  10  years  ago  [12],  and  its 
accuracy was 84% in the prediction of red-haired individuals. 
The SNPs in the OCA2 locus and the adjacent HERC2 gene in 
Europeans showed a strong correlation with blue and brown 
eye  color  [13,  14].  Other  genes  were  also  identified  as 
contributing to hair, eye, and skin color variations, such as 
IRF4,  KITLG,  SLC24A4,  SLC45A2,  TYRP1,  TYP,  and  ASIP 
[15].

Recent studies using  genome-wide association  analysis 
have identified genes and variations correlating with human 
visible  phenotypes and  developed a phenotype prediction 
program [16-19]. HIrisPlex is capable of predicting hair and 
eye color from DNA with 24 SNP variations [19]. Six of the

24  SNPs  used  for  eye  color  prediction  in  the  HIrisPlex 
program  are  rs12913832  (HERC2),  rs1800407  (OCA2), 
rs12896399  (SLC24A4),  rs16891982  (SLC45A2  [MATP]), 
rs1393350 (TYR), and rs12203592 (IRF4), and 4 of these 
SNPs within HERC2, OCA2, SLC45A2, and IRF4 are also used 
for hair color prediction. To predict hair color and hair color 
shade,  HIrisPlex  uses  22  SNPs  as  follows:  N29insA, 
rs11547464, rs885479, rs1805008, rs1805005, rs1805006, 
rs1805007, 
rs2228479,  and 
rs1110400 from the MC1R gene, rs28777 (SLC45A2 [MATP]), 
rs16891982  (SLC45A2  [MATP]),  rs12821256  (KITLG), 
rs4959270 (EXOC2), rs12203592 (IRF4), rs1042602 (TYR), 
rs1800407  (OCA2),  rs2402130  (SLC24A4),  rs12913832 
(HERC2), rs2378249 (PIGU/ASIP), and rs683 (TYRP1). The 
results of these 24 SNPs when their minor alleles are input 
into HIrisPlex are used to predict the color of an individual 
with the highest probability of the 3 eye color categories 
(brown, blue, or intermediate) and 4 hair color categories 
(blond, brown, red, and black). On average, their prediction 
accuracy was 69.5% for blonde hair, 78.5% for brown, 80% 
for  red,  87.5%  for  black  hair,  and  over  90%  for  blue  and 
brown eyes.

Few GWASs on color-related phenotype have been carried 
out  in  Asian  populations  [20,  21].  Therefore,  most  pre-
diction models for EVCs have been constructed and vali-
dated  based  on  genotype  and  phenotype  information  on 
Europeans; these  prediction  models must be validated in 
diverse ethnic populations [16-19]. In this study, we selected 
potentially  useful  variations  for  forensic  science  that  are 
associated with hair and eye color, iris pattern, and facial 
morphology, based on previous studies, and analyzed their 
frequencies in the Korean population.

Methods
Population and DNA extraction

The subjects in this study were collected from the Korea 
Association Resource (KARE) study, which has been des-
cribed in detail previously [22]. Briefly, KARE consists of 2 
community-based cohorts, Ansan (urban community) and 
Ansung (rural community) in Korea, and includes 10,038 
participants aged 40 to 69 years. Genomic DNA of 1,920 
male subjects randomly selected from the KARE study was 
extracted  from  cell  lines  immortalized  with  Epstein  Bar 
virus.

SNP selection

Using the NHGRI GWAS catalog (http://www.genome. 
gov/gwastudies)  [23],  9  articles  were  identified  with  the 
query terms “hair,” “eye,” “iris,” and “facial morphology,” 
and 26 SNPs with association p-values < 5 × 10－8 (GWAS 

p-value) were selected from the articles [10, 24-31]. The 
most significant SNPs were selected from the SNPs that were 
under pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 > 0.8).

Genotyping and quality control

Genotyping was performed at a multiplex level using the 
Illumina Golden Gate genotyping system [32]. The genotype 
quality score for retaining data was set to 0.1. SNPs that 
could not satisfy the following criteria were excluded: 1) a 
minimum call rate of 90%, 2) no duplication error, and 3) 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium greater than p > 0.001. All 20 
SNPs were successfully genotyped.

Results and Discussion 

Using the GWAS catalog, we extracted 26 candidate SNPs 
that might be useful for forensic science in terms of EVCs. 
Two SNPs in MC1R and HERC2 were already genotyped in 
subjects of the KARE study. Among 26 SNPs, 2 pairs of SNPs, 
rs1847134 and rs1393350 within TYR and rs4900109 and 
rs12896399  within  SLC24A4,  respectively,  were  under 
pairwise LD (r2 > 0.8), and 1 SNP in each pair was selected. 
Two SNPs showing low probe design ability were excluded 
from the probe selection process. Finally, 20 out of 26 SNPs 
were selected for genotyping in Koreans.

One SNP, rs7559271 (PAX3), was associated with facial 
morphology  [31];  2  SNPs,  rs3739070  (TRAF3IP1)  and 
rs10235789 (SEMA3A), were identified for the association 
with iris patterns, such as furrows and crypts, respectively 
[29]; and the remaining 17 SNPs were associated with hair 
and/or eye color [10, 24-28, 30]. Among these variants, 8 
SNPs were included in the HIrisPlex program the determine 
hair and iris color.

Allele frequencies and other genetic parameters for the 20 
SNPs are provided in Table 1. All analyzed SNPs were in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the Korean population (p > 
0.001).  Three  SNPs  that  were  associated  with  facial 
morphology  or  iris  characteristics  in  Europeans  [29,  31] 
were  polymorphic  in  the  Korean  population  as  follows: 
rs7559271 (PAX3), rs3739070 (TRAF3IP1), and rs10235789 
(SEMA3A).  Their  minor  allele  frequencies  (MAFs)  were 
0.303,  0.029,  and  0.103,  respectively.  Among  17  SNPs 
related to hair or eye color, 4 SNPs were monomorphic and 6 
SNPs  were  very  rare  (MAF  <  0.005)  in  Koreans.  The  4 
monomorphic  SNPs  in  Koreans  were  rs12203592  (IRF4), 
rs12821256 (KITLG), rs12913832 (HERC2), and rs8033165 
(intergenic). Their allele frequencies in Europeans (CEU) in 
the HapMap database were 0.167, 0.146, 0.792, and 0.447, 
respectively. The 6 rare SNPs in Koreans were rs16891982 
(SLC45A2),  rs1408799  (TYRP1),  rs35264875  (TPCN2), 
rs1393350 (TYR), and rs1805007 (MC1R), and their allele

aAllele  frequencies  of  HapMap  were  based  on  minor  alleles  of  Koreans.

frequencies in Europeans were 0.983, 0.695, 0.175, 0.226, 
and  0.121,  respectively.  The  HapMap  database  did  not 
include the allele frequency of rs12931267 (MC1R).

Since  frequency  information  alone  does  not  explain 
phenotype  variability,  association  analysis  is  required  to 
confirm the genetic effect of the SNPs between appearance 
phenotype  and  SNPs.  Stokowski  et  al.  [20]  reported  that 
SNPs in TYR, SLC45A2, and SLC24A5 were associated with 
skin  pigmentation  and  largely  accounted  for  differences 
between those with the darkest and lightest skin in a South 
Asian sample. A previous study analyzed skin and hair color 
in Koreans, categorizing hair color into 3 types and skin color 
into 4 types [33]. The 7 polymorphic SNPs in the Korean 
population are likely to contribute to color variation within 
the  Korean  population.  In  addition,  the  4  monomorphic 
SNPs  could  be  used  for  distinguishing  East  Asians  from 
Europeans.

In this study, we provided the allele frequency of 20 EVCs 
SNPs  by  genotyping  a  large  number  of  Koreans  (1,920 
individuals)  in  comparison  to  the  45  Chinese  and  45 

Japanese  recruited  for  the  International  HapMap  Project. 
Even though the usability of these SNPs should be verified by 
association study in Koreans, this study might provide 10 
potential SNP markers for forensic science for EVCs in the 
Korean population.
