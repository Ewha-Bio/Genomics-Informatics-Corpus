Abstract 
Numerous  studies  have  reported that  genes with  similar 
expression patterns are co-regulated. From gene expression 
data, we have assumed that genes having sinilar expression 
pattern would share similar transcription factor binding sites 
(TFBSs). These function as the binding regons fortransaiption 
factors (TFs) and thereby regulate  gene expression.  In  this 
context, various analysis tools have been developed. HO'v\ever, 
they have shortconings in the corrbined analysis of expression 
patterns and significant TFBSs and in the functional analysis 
of  target  genes  of  sig1ificantly  overrepresented  putative 
reg,Jiators. In this study, we present a Vl€b-based  A Functional 
OusteringAnalysis Tool fer Predicted Transcription Reg,Jiatory 
Bements and Gene OltologyTerms (FChlalyzer). This system 
integrates microarray clustering data vvith similar expression 
patterns,  and  TFBS  data  in  each  cluster.  FCAnalyzer  is 
designed to perfonn twJ independent clustering procedures. 
The first process dusters gene expression profiles using the 
K-means clustering method, and the second process clusters 
predicted  TFBSs  in  the  upstream  region  of previously 
clustered genes using the hierarchical biclustering method 
for  simultaneous  grouping  of genes  and  samples.  This 
system offers retrieved infonnation for predicted TFBSs in 
each cluster using  Match™ in the TRANSFAC database. 
VVe  used  gene  ontology  tenn  analysis  for  functional 
annotation of genes in the same cluster. VVe also provide 
the uservvith a combinatorial TFBS analysis ofTFBS pairs.

Ksywrxds:  Transcription  regulatory element,  clustering 
analysis 

Introduction 
Microarraytechnology is a powerful analytical tool that is 
commonly used to  elucidate the  expression  patterns  of 
coordinately regulated genes. Microarrays have provided 
a revolutionary platfonn for the study of gene expression, 
regulation  and function  (Walsh  and  Henderson,  2004). 
They have tremendous potential for the study of biological 
processes associated vvith health and disease. Microarray(cid:173)
based gene expression analysis will undoubtedly make a 
major contribution to our understanding ofthe underlying 
biological mechanisms of disease, and vvill ultimately lead 
to  improved  methods  for the  diagnosis,  prognosis  and 
treatment of disease (Sausville and Holbeck, 2004). The 
expression  data  produced  by  microarray hybridization 
experiments  can  lead to the  identification  of clusters  of 
co-expressed genes that are likely to be co-regulated by 
shared  regulatory  mechanisms.  Many  types  of high(cid:173)
throughput functional genomic data that can facil~ate rapid 
functional annotation of sequenced genomes are currently 
available.  Due to the  considerable  quantity and  intrinsic 
variation of the data produced from microarray experiments, 
statistical  and  computational  approaches,  including 
clustering analysis, have been used to consolidate useful 
biological infonnation from microarray data (Lobenhofer 
eta/., 2001 ). 

Moreover,  the  wide  availability  of genomic  data, 
including sequences in the upstream regions of genes, has 

made it possible to perfonn large-scale studies combining 
gene  expression  data,  and  to  enable  researchers  to 
understand both the regulation  and the mechanism of gene 
transcription. By analyzing the upstream promoter regions 
of coexpressed genes, it is possible to elucidate common 
regulatory patterns characterized byTFBSs (Kellis eta/., 
2003).  However,  it  is  important to  realize  that  precise 
analysis  methods  are  necessary to  make  an  accurate 
functional interpretation of these large-scale data sets. 
The regulation oftranscription is a very complex process 
in higher eukaryotic organisms. A large number of nuclear 
TFs  control  gene  expression  by  binding  to  regulatory 
sequence elements that are  located upstream from the 
transcriptional start sites of genes (Villard, 2004 ). TFBSs 
are  usually  5-25  base  pairs  in  length,  and  are  often 
represented as matrices. These matrices are referred to 
in the literature under a variety of labels such as position 
weight  matrices  (P\I\/Tv1),  position  frequency  matrices 
(PFM), alignment matrices, profiles and so on (Knuppel et 
a/., 1994), (Sandelin eta/., 2004).  ManyTFBS prediction 
programs using P\I\/Tv1,  such as promoterscan (Prestridge, 
1995), TSSG, and TSSVV(Solovyev and Salamov, 1997) 
have been  developed (Murakami  eta/., 2004). 

In  order to explain the mechanisms of gene expression 
in detail, it is crucial that we understand the effects ofTFBSs 
on transcriptional regulation at a genomic level, as well as 
gene expression patterns at a transcriptional level (Kasturi 
and Acharya,  2005). Analysis tools vvhich  function  on  a 
genomic level  have previously been developed (Roth  et 
a/.,  1998; Sinha andTompa 2003; Liu  et al.,  2004; Kim et 
a/.,  2005);  however,  they have  limitations  as  they  are 
unable to perfonn  this  kind  of combined  data  analysis. 
Recently, the analysis tool EXPANDER was introduced, 
vvflich is a java package for the analysis of gene expression 
data, and provides multiple-functions such as clustering, 
visualization, biclustering and dovvnstream analysis such 
as functional enrichment and promoter analysis (Shamir 
et  a/.,  2005).  Although  it  offers  a  variety  of functional 
analyses  for  genes,  it  does  not  provide  perspective 
functional  analysis  between  co-expressed  genes,  their 
significant  TFBSs  and  the  function  of  target  genes. 
FCAnalyzer focuses  more on  verifying the  relationship 
between  the  regulatory  region  and  gene  expression. 
Additionally,  we  verified  enrichment  for  TFBSs,  TFBS 
combination and functional annotations in  a cluster based 
on  Pvalues. 

The  aim  of this study was to offer a novel tool vvhich 
operates  to  perfonn  both  clustering  analysis  for  the 
detection  of expression  patterns  and validation  of the 
transaip:ional regulatory element patterns from coexpressed 
genes.  VVe  introduce  a  web-based  functional  clustering 
analysis tool that integrates microarray data with similar

expression  patterns  and  TFBS  data  to  identify  novel 
transcription  regulatory netV\oUrks  of knovvn  genes in  the 
human, mouse and rat genomes. FCAnalyzer perionns 
tvvu-step clustering procedures; K-means and hierarchical 
clustering.  K-means  clustering  is  one  of the  simplest 
unsupervised  learning  algorithms  used  to  classify,  or 
group objects together based on  attributes/features, into 
K number of groups,  vvflere  K is  a positive integer. The 
grouping is done by minimizing the sum of the squares of 
distances between  data  and the  corresponding  cluster 
centroid.  Thus the purpose  of K-means clustering  is to 
classify the data (favazoie eta/., 1999). The first procedure 
clusters  gene  expression  profiles  using  the  K-means 
clustering  method,  and  then  applies  the  hierarchical 
method (Eisen eta/., 1998) for predicted TFBSs clustering 
of genes that were previously clustered. The hierarchical 
method is one  of the most  popular analytical  methods 
currently  being  used to  characterize  gene-expression. 
The combined clustering approach that we have developed 
enables researchers to obtain results vvith  more biological 
significance than those obtained by analysis with  either 
TFBSs  or  gene  expression  data  alone.  Using  TFBS 
analysis vvith the clusters that exhibited similar expression 
patterns, we obtained TF binding andTFBS infonnation. 
information  was  used  to  construct  a  matrix 
This 
representingTFBS-TF interactions. VVe  expect this tool to 
be useful in  understanding transcription mechanisms and 
in  the characterization  of genetic networks. 

In the cluster analysis of gene expression profiles, the 
functional annotation ofthe cluster is the most prominent 
method for identifying functions of co-expressed genes. 
In  order to accomplish the functional annotation of genes 
within each cluster, we utilized an efficient computational 
approach  that  relies  on  the  description  of  biological 
processes,  molecular functions  or cellular components 
using GO terms (Ashburner eta/., 2000). 

Materials and Methods 

VVe  developed  FCAnalyzer vvhich  functions  as  a web(cid:173)
based  clustering  analysis tool  vvith  predicted TFBSs of 
genes vvhich  show similar expression patterns generated 
from  microarray data.  FCAnalyzer is  implemented in  R 
language  (http://wwvv.bioconductor.org)  and  uses  the 
MySQL (http://vvvvw.mysql.com) database. This program is 
enveloped in  a Perl  script (http://vvvvw.perl.com) in  order to 
maintain a userfiiendyV\eb interface. FChlalyzeris accessible 
at http://vvvvw.ng:i .go.kr/cgi-bin/cmams/fcanalyzer.cgi.

Databases 

Construction ofTFBS matrix databases for kncNvn genes 
of the human, mouse and rat 
The TFBS matrix database consists of putative promoter 
regions  of upstream DNA sequences  around  2,000  bp 
from the transcription start site.  In  order to construct the 
TFBS matrix database, we first collected  promoter 
sequences of known Refseq genes. The genome assemblies 
used  for promoter sequence  resources were  Build  35  in 
human, Build 33 in mouse and Rnor3.4 in rat. These data 
were obtained from the Genome sequencing consortium 
(http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/). We obtained the 2,000 
bp  promoter region  from the  UCSC Genome  Browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and used the Match™ matrix 
based  search  program to  predict TFBSs.  Match™ is  a 
powerful  web-based  tool  which  uses  positional  weight 
matrices  in  TRANSFAC® Professional.  To  obtain  high 
fidelity TFBS matrices, we set the parameters of Match™ 
to minimize false positives. After analyzing TFBS frequencies 
for each gene, we generated a TFBS frequency matrix in 
a species. Rows of the matrix are defined as Refseq genes 
while the columns represent predicted TFBSs. We present 
here  a  novel  matrix  database  containing  the  results 
following the application of the TFBS frequency matrix. 
The matrix identified 343 TFBS for 20233 genes in human, 
360 TFBS for 13032 genes in  mouse and 320 TFBS for 
3009 in  rat. 
Construction ofTF, TFBS and GO information databases 
Databases were  constructed  to  present TF  and  TFBS 

information in  designated clusters.  The annotation was 
based  on  the  annotation  used  in  the  TRANSFAC® 
database, version 8.4. To facilitate the functional annotation 
of cluster  analysis,  we  constructed  a  GO  annotation 
database for Refseq  genes.  The  GO project  began  with 
the  overall  goal  of  providing  a  unified  view  of  gene 
functional annotations for different organisms with a set 
of  three  structured  vocabularies;  biological  process, 
molecular 
function  and  cellular  component.  The 
structure  of the  ontology  is  based  on  directed  acyclic 
graphs  (DAGs)  and  organized  in  a  hierarchy.  GO 
information  is  useful  for  the  functional  analysis  of 
specific gene sets such  as  clustered  genes with  same 
expression patterns (Martinet a/., 2004). We obtained all 
known  Refseq  information  from  NCBI  (Jenuth  2000; 
Pruitt  et  a/.,  2003).  All  of the  ontology  data  and  the 
gene-GO  term  associations  were  taken  from  the  GO 
consortium  website  and  the  database  for  annotation, 
visualization  and  integrated discovery (DAVID) (Dennis 
eta/., 2003). 

Clustering analysis 
FCAnalyzer  performs  two-step  clustering  procedures: 
K-means  clustering  of gene  expression  data  and  the 
subsequent hierarchical  clustering with  predicted  TFBS 
data for each cluster (Fig.  1). 

Clustering of gene expression profiles

expression profiles with Refseq ID or Unigene ID in rows,

and  experiments  in  columns.  Users  can  set  clustering 
parameter options for two-step clustering methods. The 
first setting is the  K-means for gene expression  profiles, 
and the second is the hierarchical setting for a predicted 
TFBS matrix. To aim at superior clustering resu~s, users can 
apply other clustering methods (e.g. hierarchical clustering) 
in the preanalysis module in  FCAnalyzer. The pre-analysis 
module  provides  various  analyses  of microarray  data, 
from  raw nonnalization,  to  higher analysis  approaches 
such as significant gene selection, clustering, classification 
and visualization. Before the functional analysis, users can 
evaluate  microarray  data  with  the  pre-process  step  of 
FCAnalyzer  and  the  clustering  result  is  stored  in  a 
database.  In  addition,  a  new  TFBS  matrix  profile  for 
clustered  genes  based  predicted  TFBS  databases  is 
created for each  cluster. 
Clustering of predicted TFBSs of genes in a cluster 
The  nevvly  created  TFBS  profile  includes  all  of  the 
predicted TFBS  infonnation  for each  gene  in  a cluster. 
FCAnalyzer  perfonns  consecutive  2-way  hierarchical 
clustering with the profile. This step is perfonned in  order 
to find meaningful groups that share a similarTFBS pattern 
in genes that exhibit the same expression pattern. For the 
hierarchical dustering ofthe TFBS mabix, users can choose 
one  of many  different  dissimilarity  and  distance  matrix 
options  to  establish  optimal  clustering  conditions.  The 
linkage measures are Ward's minimum variance, complete, 
single,  average,  median,  centroid  and  Mcquitty.  The 
default  distance measure  is  binary and  others  are  also 
available such as euclidean, maximum, manhattan, canberra, 
uncentered pearson  and centered pearson. 

Follovving the tvvu-step clustering analysis, FCAnalyzer 
produces heatmap figures  shovving TFBS  clustering for 
genes in each cluster, and heatmaps for their respective 
gene  expression  profiles.  In  addition,  it  also  provides 
tab-delimited text files for the result figures. 

Exploring the biological relevance of clusters 
EnriciJtrent Analysis ofTFBS 
FCAnalyzer  provides  significant  TFBS  analysis  and 
combinatorial TFBS analysis based on Fisher's exact test 
to identify statistically over-representative TFBSs located 
in  the  upstream  sequences  of genes  in  a cluster,  and 
statistically significant enriched TFBS pairs in vvhich two 
designated TFBSs are shOVVTl  in the cluster. We used the 
test with  a one-sided option, to compare the number of 
occurrences  and  nonoccurrences in  genes  of a cluster 
versus the all genes (Fig. 2 and 3). This process can help 
the user to understand how gene expression is regulated 
and  how  biological  infonnation  is  controlled  at  the 
transcriptional level.

TFBS-TF analysis 
Analysis of target genes binding significant TFBSs 
FCAnalyzer extracts functional annotation based on GO 
term analysis for potential target genes that are regulated 
by a specified set ofTFs against significant TFBSs in  a 
cluster. Functional categorization ofthe target genes may 
be  very  important  in  the  deduction  of the  function  of 
co-expressed genes, and in  deciphering the transcriptional 
regulatory mechanisms in a cluster (Sosinsky eta/., 2003).

To this end, FCAnalyzer provides the processes to select 
significant TFBSs sorted by the p-value of Fisher's exact 
test, and then to find the significant GO terms in  putative 
target genes. 
TFBS-TF matrix constructor 
Wth the FCAnalyzer analysis tool, the user is provided with 
information about TFBS, a matrix and related TFs including 
a description and binding information. However, there are 
numerous TFBSs in the genes of a given cluster.  It is possible 
the binding sub-nelvlork of several TFBSs and TFs of interest 
may not be accessed. Here, we have developed the TFBS-TF 
matrix constructor in such a way that it facilitates easy and 
clear analysis of TFs and TFBS information. This module 
creates a  TFBS-TF binding matrix for the analysis in  an 
interactive, web-linked table format (Fig. 4-6). The user can 
view multiple binding interactions in the context of the TFBS 
or the TF (Fig.  5). This program also supports interactive 
TFBS filtering  of low occurrences  and  the  selection  of 
TFBSs for each cluster (Fig. 4). This procedure could also 
help to remove false discoveries. 

Functional annotation of gene clusters 
In the cluster analysis of gene expression profiles, functional 
annotation  of the  cluster  is  the  major  method  used  for 
identifying functions of co-expressed  genes.  There  are 
various  ways to  perform the  analysis  in  relation  to the 
biological pathway, gene annotation and disease information 
(Dennis eta/., 2003; Chung eta/., 2004; Dai eta/., 2004). A

statistical arguement as the output data can be easily and 
intuitively viewed and explored in  a web browser. 

The  user can  select  ontologies  of interest for vievving 
functional  annotation  of any  selected  cluster  in  tenns  of 
biological process, molecular function or cellular component. 
For an  easier  method to  examine  dominant tenns  in  the 
cluster, the user can also set the parameters to filter any 
tenns of low occurrence. All  figures  and result files  in  a 
tab-delimited text file format can be doiMlloadedfrom the 
dovvnload menu  of each  cluster. 

Results 
FCAnalyzer  supports  graphical  views  and  interactive 
infonnation  retrievals to provide a user friendly interface. 
This web based system provides researchers vvith the useful 
features  of infonnation  databases,  sequential  clustering 
analysis of gene expression data and clusterinfonnation for 
functional analysis. To view all ofthe infonnation on a page, 
the user can  choose to hide or showinfonnation  and the 
analysis  menu.  We  anticipate  that  these  user  friendly 
application  interfaces  vvill  facilitate  the  analysis  of gene 
expression  patterns in the field oftranscriptomics. 

Databases 
FCAnalyzer provides gene expression dustering infonnation 
and TFBS clustering infonnation of gene expression profiles. 
The system offers the description and binding infonnation 
of  TF  and  TFBS  for  regulatory  analysis.  All  of  the 
information is implemented in  a web-linked table fonnat in 
order to pennit compatibility vvith interconnected infonnation. 
The annotation  infonnation is  mainly retrieved from the 
TRANSFAC database, DAVID, and the Refseq database. 

Clustering analysis 
FCAnalyzer  includes  sequential  clustering  analysis 
procedures with  K-means clustering of gene expression 
data and subsequent hierarchical clustering of predicted 
transcription  factor  binding  sites.  To  attain  superior 
clustering results, users are free to choose other clustering 
methods  (e.g.  hierarchical  clustering)  in  the pre-analysis 
module,  and  FCAnalyser  allows  the  researcher  to 
determine an initial set of cluster centers. The user can view 
TFBSs vvith  high  frequencies in  genes that  have  a similar 
expression  patterns.  The TFBSs vvith  high  frequency are 
presented as the putative regulatory elements playing  an 
important role  in  gene  expression  regulation.  After the 
tvvu-step clustering analysis, FCAnalyzerproduces TFBS 
clustering images for genes in  each cluster, and images 
for their respective  gene  expression  profiles.  All  of the 

infonnation  required  for  clustering  analysis  is  freely 
available to dovvnload. 

Exploring the biological ralavanoa of clusters 
In  this  process,  the  user  can  explore  the  biological 
relevance of genes identified in  the clusters. This step is 
an  important  progression  vvhich  functions  to  organize 
genes with  similar expression  patterns  into  biologically 
relevant  clusters  using  GO  infonnation  (Maurer  et a/., 
2005).  The  user  can  select  ontologies  of  interest  for 
viewing the functional annotation of the selected cluster. 
FCAnalyzersupports a visual graph chartforvievvingthe 
GOtenns in order of frequency. This graphical interface 
enables the user to understand the functional specificity 
of genes  in  the  designated  cluster.  For TF  and  TFBS 
interaction  analysis,  the  TFBS-TF  matrix  constructor 
creates  TFBS-TF  binding  matrices  from  TFBS-TF 
databases for easy viewing of regulatory interactions. 

Searching  for GO !arms and  TFBS  analysis to 
ganeraiB a query gena list 
FCAnalyzer provides  GO terms  and  TFBS  analysis to 
generate  a query  gene  list  without  expression  values. 
The  user can  search for the  GO and TFBS  infonnation 
for genes selected after pre-analysis or other processes. 
They  may  also  perfonn  further  analysis  such  as  the 
analysis of target genes against significant TFBSs. 

System performance evaluation 
For the evaluation of system perfonnance, we used muscle(cid:173)
specific genes derived from the T-STAG database (Gupta 
eta/., 2005). T-STAG is a database for analyzing tissue(cid:173)
and tumor-specific expression patterns in the human and 
mouse transcriptomes. VVe followed the defau~ parameters 
ofT-STAG  to  obtain  genes  showing  muscle-specific 
expression.  Of these,  91  Refseq  mRNA records  were 
submitted to the statistical analysis module of FCAnalyzer. 
We applied  Fisher's exact test to the muscle gene sets. 
Through  this  statistical  analysis,  we  then  predicted the 
overrepresented TFBS results in muscle-specific genes. 
Next, we  evaluated the  analysis  results  using literature 
mining. VVe found that most ofthe putative muscle-specific 
reg,Jiators have been reported. For example, thewell-knOIMl 
SMAD and MAZ binding sites are ranked as high as second 
and  third  in  the  predicted  result.  In  case  of  SMAD, 
dysfunctional  SMAD  signaling  contributes to  abnonnal 
smooth muscle cell  proliferation  (Yang eta/., 2005) and 
rvw: has been irrpicated in ITlJsdefunction (Genna.in-Desprez 
eta/., 2001 ). Also, mef2 directlyregulatestarget genes at 
all stages of muscle development (Sandmann eta/., 2006). 

Therefore, 11  out of 15 putative TFBS identified here are 
knovvn  to be muscle-specific regulators (Table 1). 

Discussion 
A number of previously developed cluster analysis tools for 
the study ofmicroarray gene expression data can produce 
lists of up to hundreds of genes in  groups or clusters of 
putatively related genes. VVe have developed FCAnalyzer 
as a tool to help interpret the biological significance of such 
clusters by using transcription regulatory elements that are 
based on  predicted TFBSs. Ole limitation ofthis tool is that 
the input data needs to be filtered by some criteria for the 
enhancedTFBS clustering. Nevertheless, we expect that 
FCAnalyzervvill seiVe as a useful tool for the exploratory 
analysis of transcription  regulatory mechanisms. 

This program is designed to be useful for any researcher 
vvtlo is confronted vvith data that show putative binding site 
patterns that are shared by coexpressed genes. It is also 
expected to provide enhanced verification of the results of 
analyzing  gene  expression  profiles,  by  offering  TFBS 
information for genes with  similar expression  patterns.
