Abstract

An  accurate  system  for  predicting  the  survival  of  pa-
tients  with  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma  (OSCC)  will  be 
useful  for  selecting  appropriate  therapies.  A  nomogram 
for  predicting  survival  was  constructed  from  96  patients 
with  primary  OSCC  who  underwent  surgical  resection 
between  January  1994  and  June  2003  at  the  Yonsei 
Dental  Hospital  in  Seoul,  Korea.  We  performed  uni-
variate  and  multivariate  Cox  regression  to  identify  sur-
vival  prognostic  factors.  For  the  early  stage  patients 
group,  the  nomogram  was  able  to  predict  the  5  and  10 
year  survival  from  OSCC  with  a  concordance  index  of 
0.72.  The  total  point  assigned  by  the  nomogram  was  a 
significant  factor  for  predicting  survival.  This  nomogram 
was  able  to  accurately  predict  the  survival  after  treat-
ment  of  an  individual  patient  with  OSCC  and  may  have 
practical  utility  for  deciding  adjuvant  treatment.

Introduction

Oral  cancer  is  the  sixth  most  common  cancer  in  men 
and  the  twelfth  most  common  cancer  in  women  (Sudbo 
and  Reith,  2005).  According  to  statistics  from  1999  to 
2002,  the  annual  incidence  rate  of  oral  cancer  is  5.9% 
in  men  and  2.2%  in  women  in  South  Korea  (based  on 
data  from  the  National  Cancer  Center  in  Korea).  The  ap-
proximately  90%  of  oral  is  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
(Pisani  et al.,  1999).  Patients  with  oral  squamous  cell 
carcinoma  (OSCC)  are  often  asymptomatic,  but  may  ex-
perience  minimal  pain  in  the  early  stage  (Epstein et al., 
2007).  Despite  the  availability  of  advanced  clinical  diag-
nostic  systems,  including  computed  tomography  (CT),

and  improved  therapy,  the  overall  5-year  survival  rates 
of  OSCC  over  the  past  two  decades  are  still  poor 
(Myoung et al.,  2006).  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  de-
velop  novel  prognostic  tools  for  predicting  the  OSCC 
patients’  status,  which  could  improve  survival  by  allow-
ing  enough  time  for  the  appropriate  therapy  to  be 
implemented.
    Stephenson  et al.  (2005)  showed  that  the  prediction 
accuracy  was  improved  by  the  integration  of  clinical 
variables  and  gene  expression  (Stephenson  et  al., 
2005b).  It  has  already  been  shown  that  the  expression 
level  of  specific  genes  influence  survival.  Specific  pro-
tein  expression  was  used  to  predict  survival  in  various 
cancers  including  clear  cell  renal  carcinoma  (Kim et al., 
2004).  The  relationship  between  p53  and  the  survival  in 
OSCC has been studied by many researchers (Galli et al., 
2009;  Goulart  et al.,  2009;  Shah  et al.,  2009;  Smith  et 
al.,  2009).  In  these  studies,  some  reported  that  p53  pre-
dicted  the  survival  of  OSCC  (Galli et al.,  2009;  Shah et 
al.,  2009)  while  others  did  not  (Goulart  et al.,  2009; 
Smith  et al.,  2009),  and  Smith  et al.  (2009)  concluded 
that  p53  does  not  predict  the  progression  of  OSCC  after 
an  extensive  review  of  the  previous  studies. 
    In  this  study,  significant  clinical  factors  for  predicting 
survival  were  identified  and  a  nomogram  was  con-
structed  using  these  factors.  In  addition,  we  evaluated 
the  effect  of  p53  on  the  survival  of  OSCC  patients,  by 
embedding  it  into  the  nomogram.  The  created  nomo-
gram  was  evaluated  by  c-index.
    Nomogram  is  a  graphical  representation  of  a  stat-
istical  model  and  provides  the  probability  of  a  particular 
clinical  outcome,  such  as  death  or  recurrence  (Kattan et 
al.,  1998).  It  has  been  constructed  for  predicting  survival 
in  prostate  cancer  (Kattan  et al.,  1999;  Stephenson  et 
al.,  2005a),  vulvar  cancer  (Rouzier  et al.,  2006),  osteo-
sarcoma  (Kim et al.,  2009),  renal  cancer  (Karakiewicz et 
al.,  2007),  breast  cancer  (Rouzier et al.,  2005),  and  ad-
vanced  Non-Small-Cell  Lung  cancer  (Hoang  et  al., 
2005).  Furthermore,  nomograms  have  been  shown  to  be 
superior  to  the  traditional  staging  systems  in  predicting 
the  features  of  various  cancers  (Hoang  et al.,  2005; 
Karakiewicz et al.,  2007;  Kattan et al.,  1999;  Kim et al., 
2009;  Rouzier  et  al.,  2006;  Rouzier  et  al.,  2005; 
Stephenson  et al.,  2005a). 

Methods

Patients

We  retrospectively  investigated  96  patients  (71  men  and 
25  women)  with  primary  OSCC  who  underwent  surgical 
ablation  between  January  1994  and  June  2003  at  the 
Yonsei  Dental  Hospital  in  Seoul,  Korea.
    The  tumor  location  was  the  tongue  in  26  cases,  gingi-
va  in  56  cases,  and  other  sites  in  14  cases,  which  in-
cluded  the  buccal  cheek,  floor  of  mouth  and  lower  lip. 
The  pathological  stage  was  divided  into  two  groups, 
early  and  advanced.  The  I  and  II  stages  were  grouped 
into  the  early  group,  and  the  III  and  IV  stages  were 
grouped 
into  the  advanced  group.  The  pathologic 
(pTMN)  classification  and  staging  were  classified  ac-
cording  to  the  6th  edition  of  AJCC  (American  Joint 
Committee  on  Cancer).

Immunohistochemical  staining 

Immunohistochemical  staining  for  p53  was  performed 
using  an  EnVision-HRP  detection  system  (Dako,  Carpin-
teria,  CA,  USA).  The  primary  antibody  was  the  p53 
monoclonal  antibody,  which  specifically  stained  p53 
(Dako).  Sections  (3μm  thick)  were  cut  from  tumor  tis-
sue  blocks  mounted  on  slides  and  sections  were  dried 
for  1-2  hours  at  56oC.  Briefly,  sections  were  deparaffi-
nized  in  xylene  and  were  rehydrated  in  graded  alcohol. 
After  antigen  retrieval  by  the  addition  of  citrate  buffer 
(pH,  6.0)  with  the  use  of  an  autoclave  at  full  power  for 
4  min,  tissue  sections  were  treated  with  3%  hydrogen 
peroxide  for  10  min  to  block  endogenous  peroxidase. 
Sections  were  incubated  with  p53  (1:50)  in  a  humid 
chamber  overnight  at  4oC.   
    Slides  were  then  incubated  with  Envision  reagent  fol-
lowed  by  incubation  with  Diaminobenzidine  (DAB)  chro-
mogen,  slides  were  counterstained  with  Mayer’s  hema-
toxylin,  and  then  mounted.  All  of  the  stained  sections 
were  imaged  by  a  light  microscope.

Immunohistochemical  analysis 

Immunohistochemical  staining  was  evaluated  by  an  in-
vestigator  who  did  not  know  the  clinicopathological 
characteristics  or  the  clinical  outcome  of  the  patients. 
Specimens  were  considered  positive  for  staining  when 
the  tumor  cells  had  dark  brown  nuclei,  and  specimens 
were  considered  negative  for  staining  when  the  tumor 
cells  had  only  blue  nuclei.  The  percentage  of  stained  tu-
mor  cells  was  graded  using  a  four-point  scale  (0,  ＋1, 
＋2,  ＋3,  ＋4)  as  follows:  0,  none  of  the  tumor  cells 

Predictive  Model  for  OSCC  Patients    213

were  stained;  ＋1,  ≤25%  of  the  tumor  cells  were 
stained;  ＋2,  25%  to  ≤50%  of  the  tumor  cells  were 
stained;  ＋3,  50%  to  ≤75%  of  the  tumor  cells  were 
stained;  ＋4,  ＞75%  of  tumor  cells  were  stained.  The 
intensity  was  divided  into  negative,  weak,  moderate  and 
strong  (0,  ＋1,  ＋2,  ＋3). 

Histological  grading 

OSCC  tissue  specimens  were  subjected  to  routine  hem-
atoxylin  and  eosin  (H  &  E)  staining.  Specimens  were 
graded  into  well  (G1),  moderately  (G2)  and  poorly  (G3) 
differentiated  squamous  cell  carcinomas  using  the  World 
Health  Organization  (WHO)  grading  system.  Thirty-one 
cases  were  well  differentiated,  49  cases  were  moder-
ately  differentiated,  and  16  cases  were  poorly  differen-
tiated.

Statistical  analysis

The  relationships  between  the  clinical  factors  were  test-
ed  using  the  Chi-square  statistic.  Univariate  and  multi-
variate  analyses  were  performed  to  assess  the  effects  of 
various  factors  on  the  prediction  of  survival.  The  Cox 
proportional  hazard  model  was  used  to  perform  the 
multivariate  analysis.
    Nomogram  for  the  prediction  of  survival  of  OSCC  pa-
tients  was  created  with  the  selected  significant  variables 
and  evaluated  by  the  concordance  index  (c-index). 
Calibration  was  assessed  by  plotting  the  predicted  ver-
sus  the  actual  probability.  All  statistical  analyses  were 
performed  using  R  with  the  Design,  eha  and  Hmisc 
libraries.

Results  and  Discussion

The  clinical  features  and  p53  expression  of  the  96  pa-
tients  used  in  this  study  are  summarized  in  Table  1. 
They  underwent  surgical  resection  between  January 
1994  and  June  2003  at  the  Severance  Hospital  in  Seoul, 
Korea.  The  association  of  clinical  factors  and  patho-
logical  groups  was  shown  using  p-values 
from 
chi-square  test  in  Table  1. 
    Tumor  site,  LN  metastasis  and  T  stage  were  sig-
nificantly  and  differentially  distributed  between  the  early 
and  advanced  groups.  The  outcome  pattern  was  also 
significantly  different.  This  result  indicated  that  early  and 
advanced  groups  have  different  clinical  characteristics; 
therefore,  the  predictive  model  should  be  identified  for 
each  stratified  groups.  In  regards  to  tumor  sites,  32.5% 
of  gingiva  was  in  the  early  stage  while  77%  was  in  the 
advanced  group.  Lymph  node  metastasis  was  not  ob-
served  in  the  early  group  while  over  60%  was  in  the  ad-

    The  primary  end  point  was  survival  time.  The  free-sur-
vival  interval  was  defined  as  the  time  between  the  date 
of  surgery  to  the  last  visit  or  the  date  when  the  patient 
died.  Univariate  and  multivariate  analyses  were  carried 
out 
the  characteristics  associated  with 
survival.  Table  2  shows  the  results  of  the  univariate  and 
multivariate  Cox  regression  analysis 
for  the  whole 
dataset. 
    P  stage  and  LN  metastasis  were  significant  factors  in 
the  univariate  analysis  and  no  significant  factors  were 
identified  in  the  multivariate  analysis.  Therefore,  it  would 
be  desirable  to  construct  a  predictive  model  separately 
using  the  P  stage.  It  would  also  be  possible  to  con-
struct  separate  models  using  LN  metastasis,  because 
LN  metastasis  was  shown  to  be  a  significant  factor  in 
the  univariate  analysis.
    To  explore  the  association  of  p53  expression  with 

other  clinical  factors,  a  chi-square  test  was  performed. 
The  results  were  summarized  in  Table  3. 
    From  Table  3,  p53  was  shown  to  not  be  significantly 
associated  with  any  clinical  factors  in  the  whole  dataset 
and  advanced  group,  and  it  was  only  significantly  asso-
ciated  with  the  Tumor  Site  in  the  early  group.  These  re-
sults  indicated  that  p53  can  be  a  novel  and  independent 
predictor  in  the  prediction  model.  In  the  separate  analy-
sis  of  the  early  and  advanced  groups,  LN  metastasis 
had  only  one  category,  ‘negative’,  in  the  early  group; 
therefore,  we  excluded  this  variable  from  the  model 
(Table  4). 
    No  significant  factors  were  identified  in  the  advanced 
group.  However,  Grade  was  significant  and  p53  was 
shown  to  be  slightly  significant  in  the  early  group,  even 
though  the  p-value  was  only  marginally  larger  than  0.05. 
Therefore,  we  constructed  a  nomogram  for  the  early 
stage  of  OSCC.

for  predicting 

even  though  it  was  slightly  significant  in  the  multivariate 
analysis.  The  nomogram  operates  by  summing  the 
points  of  each  independent  covariate.  The  probabilities 
of  5-year  and  10-year  survival  are  identified  by  the  cal-
culated  total  point  (Fig.  2).
    Fig.  2  shows  that  the  probability  of  free-survival  in-
creased  as  the  total  points  increased.  For  example,  if 
the  total  point  was  140  for  a  patient,  the  probabilities  of 
5  and  10  year  survival  would  be  90%  and  78%, 
respectively.  We  also  investigated  if  the  total  point  cal-
culated  by  the  nomogram  would  be  a  novel  predictor. 
The  mean  of  total  points  assigned  by  the  nomogram 
was  116.5  and  we  stratified  patients  into  two  groups  us-
ing  this  value.  The  sample  size  for  the  early  stage  was 
40,  which  was  not  sufficient  to  identify  subsets;  how-

ever,  we  examined  if  the  total  points  derived  from  the 
nomogram  could  significantly  classify  the  survival  of 
OSCC.  For  this,  the  Kaplan-Meier  survival  curve  was 
plotted  and  the  Log-Rank  test  was  performed  (Fig.  3).
    Fig.  3  shows  the  stratification  of  the  survival  curves 
based  on  total  points  assigned  by  the  nomogram,  and 
those  curves  were  significantly  different  (p-value＜0.05). 
This  p-value  should  be  considered  as  a  measure  of 
curve  separation.  Based  on  the  results  shown  in  Figure 
3,  the  total  point  calculated  by  nomogram  could  be  a 
combined  marker  for  predicting  survival.
    The  nomogram  can  be  a  model  in  which  known  prog-
nostic  factors  can  be  combined  and  used  for  risk  pre-
diction  in  cancer  (Bianco,  2006).  One  advantage  of 
nomograms  is  that  they  are  weighted  models  comprised

that  underwent  surgical  resection.  The  nomogram  pre-
dicts  the  probability  of  survival  with  a  concordance  in-
dex  of  0.72. 
    In  this  study,  grade  was  found  to  be  a  key  prognostic 
factor  in  the  early  stage  group,  while  it  was  not  sig-
nificant  in  the  advanced  group.  p53  was  slightly  sig-
nificant  in  the  early  stage  (p=0.0857),  which  was  pre-
viously  shown  not  to  be  able  to  predict  the  progression 
of  OSCC  (Smith et al.,  2009).  However,  we  included  p53 
in  the  predictive  model  when  constructing  the  nomo-
gram,  and  explored  the  influence  of  p53.  In  this  analy-
sis,  p53  was  shown  to  be  significant  in  the  nomogram, 
and  its  high  expression  was  correlated  with  the  in-
creased  probability  of  survival  even  though  it  did  not 
improve  the  c-index. 
    To  evaluate  the  constructed  nomogram,  we  de-
termined  whether  the  total  points  calculated  by  the 
nomogram  could  be  used  as  a  predictive  factor,  besides 
the  c-index.  The  mean  value  of  the  total  points  was 
116.5,  and  we  divided  patients  into  two  groups  using 
this  value.  A  new  marker  based  on  the  total  points  was 
determined  to  be  a  significant  factor  in  the  survival 
model  (p＜0.05).  Therefore,  a  factor  based  on  the  total 
points  can  be  a  novel  predictive  marker.  In  addition,  the 
randomization  of  patients  in  clinical  trials  by  composite 
risk  factors  specific  to  OSCC  would  be  possible  using 
the  nomogram. 
    This  nomogram  would  be  a  useful  tool  for  physicians 
who  have  to  make  decisions  in  the  diagnosis  of  OSCC 
patients.  For  example,  a  patient  with  high  expression  of 
p53,  G2  and  T2  stage  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  the 
oral  tongue  is  predicted  to  have  a  79.8%  and  60.7% 
probability  of  5-year  and  10-year  survival,  respectively. 
If  the  physicians  can  accurately  estimate  the  probability 
of  survival,  they  could  be  able  to  improve  the  life  of  pa-
tients  by  choosing  more  appropriate  treatment.
    In  this  study,  we  constructed  a  predictive  nomogram 
for  the  early  stage  of  OSCC,  based  on  a  sample  size

of  independent  prognostic  factors,  which  provide  an  ap-
preciation  of  the  magnitude  of  impacts  of  individual  fac-
tors  on  outcome  probability  (Kim et al.,  2009).  An  accu-
rate  survival  prediction  model  would  be  useful  for  pa-
tient  counseling,  planning  follow-up,  and  selecting  pa-
tients  for  additional  treatment  (Kim  et al.,  2004).
    The  data  set  that  was  used  in  this  study  had  sig-
nificantly  different  characteristics  between  early  and  ad-
vanced  stages.  In  this  case,  identification  of  the  predict-
able  model  for  each  stratified  groups  could  be  more 
reliable.  In  addition,  no  significant  factors  were  detected 
in  the  advanced  group  when  we  performed  multivariate 
analysis  for  each  groups.  Therefore,  we  developed  and 
validated  a  nomogram  for  predicting  5-year  and  10-year 
survival  probability  of  OSCC  patients  in  the  early  stage

of  40.  This  sample  size  may  not  be  large  enough  to 
construct  a  predictive  model.  In  addition,  there  might  be 
more  variables  that  we  did  not  include  in  the  model. 
However,  this  is  the  first  prognostic  nomogram  devel-
oped  to  predict  the  survival  of  Korean  patients.  The 
constructed  nomogram  could  be  improved  with  more 
data  and  by  including  biological  candidates  in  the  pre-
dictive  model.
