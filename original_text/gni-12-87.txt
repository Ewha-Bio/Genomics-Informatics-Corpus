Transposable Elements and Genome Size 

Variations in Plants

Although the number of protein-coding genes is not highly variable between plant taxa, the DNA content in their genomes 
is highly variable, by as much as 2,056-fold from a 1C amount of 0.0648 pg to 132.5 pg. The mean 1C-value in plants is 2.4 
pg, and genome size expansion/contraction is lineage-specific in plant taxonomy. Transposable element fractions in plant 
genomes are also variable, as low as ~3% in small genomes and as high as ~85% in large genomes, indicating that genome 
size is a linear function of transposable element content. Of the 2 classes of transposable elements, the dynamics of class 1 
long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons is a major contributor to the 1C value differences among plants. The activity of 
LTR retrotransposons is under the control of epigenetic suppressing mechanisms. Also, genome-purging mechanisms have 
been adopted to counter-balance the genome size amplification. With a wealth of information on whole-genome sequences 
in plant genomes, it was revealed that several genome-purging mechanisms have been employed, depending on plant taxa. 
Two genera, Lilium and Fritillaria, are known to have large genomes in angiosperms. There were twice times of concerted 
genome size evolutions in the family Liliaceae during the divergence of the current genera in Liliaceae. In addition to the LTR 
retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons and satellite DNAs contributed to the huge genomes in the two genera by 
possible failure of genome counter-balancing mechanisms.

Introduction

Although  some  plants  exist  in  aquatic  environments, 
plants are mainly denizens of land. Since the first brave aqua-
tic algae landed on plants in the Silurian period about 450 
million years ago, plants had spread from the tundra to tropic 
and aquatic lake or ocean to alpines. The physical mass and 
size  are  also  enormously  variable,  from  only  a  few  milli-
meters long in bryophytes to over 90 meters tall in euca-
lyptus.  The  sessile  nature  and  lack  of  obvious  immune 
systems  of  green  plants  may  have  adopted  different  life 
strategies compared to species in the animal kingdom.

The  genome,  the  genetic  material  of  an  organism,  has 
been adopted for ambient environments. As seen in the wide 
range  of  ecological  niches  and  structural  complexity,  the 
cellular genome is also highly variable in plant species by as 
much as over 2,000-fold [1, 2]. Cellular DNA content has 
been measured in over 6,000 plant species [1, 2], and high- 
quality DNA sequence information is available from about 

50 plant species [3]. Prior to the genomic era, the general 
idea was that plant genomes constitute a large amount of 
‘junk’ or ‘parasitic’ or ‘selfish’ DNAs [4, 5], which are mostly 
repetitive DNAs and transposable elements. However, these 
DNAs have been revisited with a plethora of genomic infor-
mation  and  considered  genomic  gold  in  the  evolution  of 
eukaryotic taxa [6-8]. The extreme genome size variation of 
eukaryotes, especially in plant taxa, has posited a conun-
drum in evolutionary genetics. The recently updated infor-
mation of whole-genome sequences is shedding light from 
diverse angles to understand genome size variations with 
evolutionary and biological significance in many organisms. 
This  review  excerpts  topics  on  genome  size  variation  in 
relation with transposable elements. In the last session, the 
transposable elements and genome evolution in the Lilia-
ceae family, known to have large genomes in angiosperms, 
will be discussed.

SI  Lee  and  NS  Kim.  Transposable  Elements  and  Genome  Size  in  Plants 

Eukaryotic Genome Architecture 

relation with genome size and transposable elements. 

The redundant nature of eukaryotic genomes was ana-
lyzed  well  before  the  dawn  of  modern  genomic  analysis. 
Waring and Britten [9] demonstrated that not all DNA coded 
for genes in eukaryotes by reassociation kinetic analysis of 
mouse DNA. The DNA reassociation kinetic analysis, Cot 
analysis, allows one to dissect the genomic composition in 
several species, in which the genomes of complex organisms 
can be fractionated into several classes depending on the 
repetitiveness,  such  as  unique,  slightly  repetitive,  mode-
rately repetitive, and highly repetitive sequences [10]. The 
Cot analysis was very useful in the analysis of the genome 
complexity  in species  with large genomes, such as major 
crop plants [11-13]. 

When the eukaryotic chromosomes are dissected at the 
molecular level, sequence composition is not even along the 
chromosomes. While the low-copy protein coding sequen-
ces are clustered in discrete blocks between various repe-
titive  DNA  sequences,  the  repeated  DNA  sequences  are 
located at a few defined sites or widely dispersed, depending 
on the classes of repetitive DNA [14, 15]. The chromosomal 
landmarks of repeated sequences include centromeres, telo-
meres, nucleolus organizing region (NOR), and heterochro-
matin. While centromeres house highly repeated satellite 
DNA sequences and Ty3/gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) 
retrotransposons, Ty1/copia LTR retrotransposons and micro-
satellites  or  simple  sequence  repeats  are  dispersed  and 
present in clusters [15, 16]. The 18S-5.8S-25S rRNA gene 
repeats are on the NORs, which appear as secondary con-
strictions in cytological preparations [14, 15]. Another re-
peat of the 5S rRNA gene is also clustered in one or more 
sites in chromosomes [14-16]. The chromosomal tips, telo-
meres, also contain many thousands of the telomere repeat 
TTAGGG [14, 17]. Besides these repeat motifs, many other 
types of intercalary tandem repeats or dispersed repeats are 
also scattered along the chromosomes. 

Eukaryotic  nuclear  DNA  is  packaged  into  chromatin 
structure.  During  interphase,  the  local  structure  of  chro-
matin  depends  on  the  genes  present  in  the  DNA.  The 
low-copy  protein-coding  genes  are  loosely  packaged  into 
euchromatin,  whereas  sequences  of  protein-noncoding 
genes  are  tightly  packaged  into  the  gene  desert  hetero-
chromatin. The local chromatin structure can be altered by 
epigenetic  chemical  modification  of  the  DNA  and  chro-
matin-associated proteins. The chromatin structure dyna-
mic is a critical process in the regulation of DNA replication, 
gene expression control, and cell division [18]. Some points 
of the epigenetic control of gene expression and DNA repli-
cation are beyond the scope of this review; so, epigenetic 
chromatin modifications will be dealt here in detail only in 

Transposable Elements (TEs) 

Since the discovery of transposable elements in maize in 
1940s by McClintock [19-22], TEs have been found to be 
ubiquitously present in eukaryotes [23]. TEs are capable of 
moving their locations within the genome so that they can 
generate  genomic  plasticity  by  inducing  various  chromo-
somal mutations and allelic diversity [24-26]. TEs are con-
ventionally  classified  into  two  classes  based  on  the  tran-
sposition mode: class 1 TEs and class 2 TEs [27]. Class 1 TEs 
are the retrotransposons that retrotranspose via an mRNA 
intermediate in a “copy-and-paste” process that can lead to 
extremely high copy numbers in the genome. Class 2 TEs 
comprise transposons that transpose directly via DNA by a 
“cut-and-paste” process that allows them to attain moderate 
copies in the genome. With the plethora of information of 
whole-genome sequences in a growing number of species [3, 
28], more and more families of TEs are being mined, which 
necessitates the adoption of a unified classification system 
for TEs. This systematic classification groups the TEs into 2 
major classes, 9 orders, and 29 superfamilies by the mode of 
chromosomal  integration,  gene  structure,  and  sequence 
similarity [23]. 

Class 1 TEs can be subdivided into several subclasses but 
generally  into  two  subclasses:  LTR  retrotransposons  and 
non-LTR  retrotransposons.  Although  both  LTR  and  non- 
LTR  retrotransposons  are  in  plant  genomes,  LTR  retro-
transposons  are  more  prevalent  than  non-LTR  retrotran-
sposons in plant species. LTRs range from a few hundred 
base  pairs  to  several  kb  (kilobases),  and  LTRs  start  with 
nucleotides of 5'-TG-3' and end with 5'-CA-3'. Because the 
LTR retrotransposons integrate into 4- to 6-bp staggered cut 
sites, they produce 4- to 6-bp target site duplication (TSD) 
upon  integration.  The  LTR  retrotransposons  encode  two 
open reading frames, GAG and POL [29-31]. GAG encodes a 
protein  for  replication,  and  POL  encodes  protease  (PR), 
integrase (INT), reverse transcriptase (RT), and RNase H 
(RH).  The  LTR  retrotransposons  are  divided  into  two 
superfamilies, Ty1-copia (Pseudovirideae) and Ty3-gypsy (Me-
tavirideae), based on the order of genes they encode [23]. 
The  overall  sequences  are  similar,  but  the  gene  order  is 
PR-INT-RT-RH in Ty1-copia and PR-RT-INT-RH in Ty3-gypsy 
retrotransposons, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of the 
RT domain revealed a monophyletic origin of the Ty1-copia 
and Ty3-gypsy subfamilies [32, 33]. Moreover, the high se-
quence  similarity  and  gene  structure  between  Ty3-gypsy 
elements and retroviruses indicate that retroviruses evolved 
from Ty3-gypsy elements by acquisition of the env gene [31, 
34].

Although  non-LTR  retrotransposons  are  less  prevalent 
than LTR retrotransposons in plant taxa, four main orders of 
class  1  non-LTR  retrotransposons,  Dictyostelium  interme-
diate  repeat  sequence,  Penelope-like  element),  long  inter-
spersed  nuclear  elements  and  short  interspersed  nuclear 
element), are found in plants [23, 31]. DIRSs carry unusual 
split direct repeats or an inverted repeat at both ends and do 
not produce TSD upon integration. Termini of PLE elements 
are LTR-like, but their orientation can be either a direct or an 
inverted  orientation.  They  have  an  RT  and  endonuclease 
domain, and the RT domain of PLE is more similar to telo-
merase  than  the  RT  of  LTR  retrotransposons.  Both  long 
interspersed  nuclear  elements  (LINEs)  and  short  inter-
spersed nuclear elements (SINEs) lack LTRs at their termini. 
While LINEs can reach several kb, SINEs are short (80‒500 
bp). LINEs are predominant elements in animal genomes, 
whereas they are not prevalent in plant genomes except the 
Del-2 element, which is highly abundant in the genomes of 
species  in  the  genus  Lilium.  The  Del-2  elements  will  be 
discussed in more detail in the following session. Of the five 
major superfamilies (R2, L1, RTE, I, and Jokey) in the LINE 
order, only L1 and I are present in plant genomes [23, 31]. 
SINEs  are  also  highly  abundant  in  animal  genomes, 
especially in mammalian genomes; they are relatively less 
dominant in plant genomes. The best known SINE is the Alu 
element, which is present in up to 500,000 copies in the 
human genome [35]. The origin of SINEs is obscure and is 
presumed to have originated from various polymerase  III 
transcripts.  Their  AT-rich  3'-region  carries  35-bp  tandem 
repeats or contains a poly(T) tail, the pol III termination 
signal [35]. 

Class II DNA transposons can be subdivided into subclass 
1 of terminal inverted repeat (TIR) transposons and subclass 
2 of non-TIR transposons [23, 31]. The subclass 1 TIR DNA 
transposons  are  flanked  by  various  lengths  of  TIRs  and 
produce various lengths of small TSDs upon integration. The 
TIR transposons encode a transposase, which excises the 
element from the genome and integrates into a new site in 
the genome, because it has both endonuclease and ligase 
activity [36-38]. The TIRs form a secondary structure where 
transposases bind. Most of the known transposases carry a 
DDE catalytic motif, which comes in close proximity to each 
other and forms a catalytic center to enable the enzyme to 
excise  the  transposon  DNA  from  the  original  site  and 
reinsert it into the target site [39]. The subclass 1 TIR DNA 
transposons are classified into 10 superfamilies based on the 
sequence similarities. Of the 10 superfamilies, plant geno-
mes  harbor  6  superfamilies:  Tc-Mariner,  hAT,  Mutator,  P, 
PIF-Harbinger, and CACTA. 

In the subclass 2 non-TIR DNA transposons, two non-TIR 
DNA transposon superfamilies, Helitrons and Maverick, are 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

present. Helitrons are widespread, diverse, and abundant in 
some plants, but their identification is difficult due to their 
lack  of  a  terminal  repeat  structure  [40].  The  Helitrons 
replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism and do not produce 
TSDs upon integration. Helitrons can attain very high copy 
numbers  and  create  genomic  diversity.  Indeed,  they  are 
present in high copies, and captured gene fragments of pseu-
dogenes contribute to maize genome diversity [41-43].

Depending on the movability both class 1 and class 2 TEs 
can  be  further  classified  into  autonomous  and  non-auto-
nomous elements. While the autonomous elements equip 
all the machinery in mobilizing themselves, the non-auto-
nomous elements lack one or all of the components of this 
machinery [44]. The non-autonomous elements are decayed 
autonomous elements by deletion or other mutations, but 
they are highly abundant in plant genomes [23]. Transpo-
sition of class 1 elements is a multi-step process. That is, 
they must be transcribed and translated to produce proteins 
to reverse-transcribe the mRNA and package it into virus- 
like particles. The non-autonomous class 1 retrotransposons 
lack self-encoded proteins, so that the multi-step is blocked. 
However, they can be mobilized if the missing proteins are 
provided  in  trans  [45].  The  BARE1  and  BARE2  elements 
illustrate an example of the autonomy and non-autonomy of 
the class 1 retrotransposons. BARE1 (Barley RetroElement1) 
is a copia-like retrotransposon and highly abundant in the 
barley genome [46]. It is an autonomous element, and the 
protein  machinery  encoded  is  produced.  The  BARE2  is  a 
non-autonomous element, having most of its protein-coding 
domains intact, except for the defective Gag gene. The defect 
of BARE2 was complemented by the BARE1 machinery to 
retrotranspose in the barley genome [47]. In class 2 DNA 
transposons, the non-autonomous elements cannot express 
transposase  to  catalyze  their  own  transposition.  Because 
they were derived from autonomous elements, they form a 
binary system in terms of mobilization, which was recog-
nized  in  the  Ac/Ds  system  by the  early pioneering  obser-
vation  in  maize  by  McClintock  [22].  miniature  inverted 
repeat transposable elements) are worthwhile mentioning 
here among the non-autonomous class 1 transposons [48- 
50]. Because MITEs are small and carry only the minimal 
feature of TIR, they have been elusive in the identification of 
autonomous elements to mobilize them to attain very high 
copies  in  plant  genomes.  By  an  extensive  bioinformatics 
search, it was revealed that Stowaway MITEs were derived 
from the Tc1/mariner  superfamily, and  Tourist  MITEs were 
derived from the  PIF/Harbinger superfamily [51].  Thus,  it 
was deduced that MITEs can burst by autonomous elements 
in these superfamilies.

C-values of Spermatophyte

C-value or genome size refers to the total amount of DNA 
in an unreplicated haploid or gametic nucleus of an organism 
[52]. C-value varies tremendously by as much as 660,000- 
fold  among  eukaryotes,  from  2.3  Mb  in  Encephalitozoon 
intestinalis, a parasitic microsporidian, to 148,880 Mb in Paris 
japonica, a monocotyledonous plant in Liliales [53-55]. The 
general trend of C-value is that simple organisms have small 
genomes and complex higher organisms have large geno-
mes. However, the C-value variation is even present among 
closely related species, and genomic DNA content is often 
poorly correlated with organismal complexity, which pro-
jects the C-value paradox [56]. 

Plant taxa show more C-value variation than other taxa 
(Table 1) [3, 57]. Among land plants, the genome size varia-
tion is as much as a 2,348-fold difference from the smallest, 
Genlisea  margaretae (1C = 63.4  Mbp),  to  the largest, Paris 
japonica (1C = 148,880 Mb). Large size differences exist even 
in a single genus at the same ploidy level as in the genus 
Eleocharis, which comprises more than 250 species, in which 
E. acicularis (2n = 20, C = 0.25 pg) is 20 times smaller than 
E.  palustris  (2n  =  16,  C  =  5.5  pg)  [58].  Using  Feulgen 
microdensitometry  or  flow  cytometry,  C-value  has  been 
measured in over 6,000 plant species and categorized in the 
Kew  Plant  DNA  C-value  Databases  (http://data.kew.org/

cvalues/) [1, 2]. The average genome size (1C) is 5.809 Gbp 
(1  pg  =  980  Mbp)  in  angiosperms  and  18.157  Gbp  in 
gymnosperms, respectively. The median 1C-value is 2.401 
Gbp  for  angiosperms  and  17.506  Gbp  for  gymnosperms, 
respectively; indicating that genome size in angiosperms is 
not evenly distributed but skewed, favoring a small size. 

With the rapid development of high-throughput sequen-
cing technologies, the list of complete genomes that have 
been sequenced is growing sharply to provide deep insights 
into genomic evolution by comparing whole-genome infor-
mation  [28,  59,  60].  In  plants,  genome  sequences  are 
available in more than 50 species, including 36 dicots, 16 
monocots, 1 gymnosperm, and 1 each of a lycophyte and 
bryophyte [28]. The genome size in the list ranges from the 
smallest genome of the carnivorous Utricularia gibba (blad-
derwort) at 82 Mb [61] to the largest genome of a gym-
nosperm species, Picea abies (Norway spruce), at 19,800 Mbp 
[62]. The most frequent genome size of the sequenced plant 
genomes is about 500 Mbp, which is similar to the average 
genome  size  in  the  Kew  Plant  DNA  C-value  Database 
(http://data.kew.org/cvalues). 

Transposable Elements and Genome Size

Repeated DNA sequences are predominant in the plant 
genome. The repeat sequences range from 3% of the small 

90

www.genominfo.org

genome of U. gibba [61] to 85% of the large genome of maize 
[63]. Transposable elements constitute most of the repeated 
DNAs. Of the two classes of transposable elements, class 1 
retrotransposons constitute significant proportions in plant 
genomes.  Of  the  first  50  plant  genomes  sequenced,  the 
number of full-length LTR retrotransposons is available in 
21 species, in which the genome size increment correlated 
with the abundance of repeated sequences (r2 = 0.584) and 
LTR retrotransposons (r2 = 0.68) [28]. 

The “cut-and-paste” class 2 DNA transposons multiply 
their copies when the transpositions occurs from a recently 
replicated genomic region into unreplicated genomic regions 
or  when  the  excision  site  is  repaired  by  gene  conversion 
using the intact sister chromatid as a template [64]. Thus, 
the class 2 DNA transposons do not usually attain high copy 
numbers,  and  their  impact  on  genome  size  is  minimal. 
Among class 2 elements, MITEs are an exception in copy 
number, because they are present at extremely high copy 
numbers in some genomes [65, 66]. However, the small size 
of MITEs, 200‒500 bp, has a limitation on their impact on 
genomic obesity [67]. 

The semiconservative “copy-and-paste” transposition can 
increase  copy  numbers  of  the  class  1  retrotransposons 
continuously. Indeed, the magnitude of C-value variation in 
plant genomes cannot be explained solely by whole genome 
duplication (WGD), and genome contents are highly corre-
lated with the amount of class 1 retrotransposons among the 
sequenced genomes [28, 67]. Unless there are mechanisms 
of removing these class 1 retrotransposons or other repeated 
sequences,  plants  may  end  up  with  a  ‘one-way  ticket’  to 
genomic obesity [68]. Does a large genome actually cause 
any problem in the adaptation of host species? In a sense, the 
dramatic increase of noncoding or repeated sequences must 
give some burden to the cell for replication and metabolism, 
which  was  postulated  by  the  ‘large  genome  constraint 
hypothesis’ [69]. That is, the nutritional requirements of the 
extra  phosphorus  (P),  a  major  constituent  of  DNA,  and 
subsequent  longer  replication  times  may  result  in  longer 
generation  times and  a reduction  in fecundity,  leading to 
selective  disadvantage  [70].  Actually,  plants  having  a 
1C-value  of  less  than  3  pg  could  be  annual,  biennial,  or 
perennial, whereas plants having a 1C-value of larger than 25 
pg cannot grow quickly enough to be annual and are to be 
obligate perennials [71]. Genome sizes of angiosperms are 
skewed, favoring a small size, except for a few extreme large 
genomes [1, 67]. The fact that lower unicellular organisms 
usually have relatively small genomes implies that genomic 
obesity by redundant sequences must have posed a negative 
impact on their survival. Nevertheless, some plant genomes 
have survived with so many burdensome large fractions of 
repeated DNAs, implying that the negative effect of redun-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  3,  2014

dant DNAs may have been negated by some compensation. 
Of the 50 sequenced plant genomes, the median C-value was 
about 500 Mbp. The species with around 500 Mbp genomes 
(rice,  sorghum,  etc.)  have  genomes  that  are  about  30% 
transposable elements; so, it was argued that the average 
transposable element fraction is around 30% of the plant 
genomes [28]. Large genome information with high accu-
racy  and  effective  bioinformatics  tools  have  unveiled  the 
biological roles of repeated DNAs, for which several excel-
lent reviews are available on this aspect [6, 72-74]. 

The  ever  increasing  class  1  retrotransposons  can  be 
counterbalanced  by  genome-purging  mechanisms  that 
include illegitimate or unequal recombination between LTRs 
and other types of deletions [75]. Intrastrand homologous 
recombination between directly repeated LTRs deletes the 
sequences between LTRs, leaving solo LTRs [76]. Analysis of 
solo LTRs and comparison of internally deleted retrotran-
sposons showed that illegitimate intrastrand homologous 
recombination  may be the driving  force to maintain slim 
genomes in Arabidopsis [77] and rice [78]. Recently inserted 
TEs are often removed from the genome, leading to rapid 
genomic  turnover.  For  example,  the  rice  genome  expe-
rienced several bursts of LTR retrotransposons during the 
last 5 million years but ultimately removed over half of the 
inserted LTR retrotransposon DNA [79]. The cotton genus, 
Gossypium, provided another example genome expansion and 
contraction.  The  diploid  Gossypium  species  showed  3-fold 
differences in genome size, from 88 Mbp in the D-genome of 
New  World  cotton  to  2,572  Mbp  in  the  K-genome  of 
Australian  cotton  [80].  Gorge3  is  a  gypsy-like  retrotran-
sposon in the Gossypium species. The expansion and con-
traction  of  Gorge  3  were  lineage-specific  phylogenetically 
among Gossypium species. The smaller genomes showed not 
only slow gain of Gorge3 compared to the larger genomes but 
also effective removal of Gorge3 elements, which exceeded 
the rate of the gain [76]. 

Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) after double-strand 
break (DSB) can also lead to massive genomic restructuring 
by purging LTR retrotransposons in a small genome [81]. 
The genome of Oryza brachyantha is 60% smaller than its 
close relative cultivating species, Oryza sativa, in which 50% 
of  the  size  difference  was  due  to  the  amplification  and 
deletion  of  recent  LTR  retrotransposons.  Of  the  32,038 
protein-coding genes of O. brachyantha, only 70% of them 
were  in  collinear  positions  in  comparison  with  the  rice 
genome.  So,  the  authors  argued  that  the  low  LTR  retro-
transposon  activity  and  massive  internal  deletions  of  the 
LTRs by NHEJ after DSB shaped the current O. brachyantha 
genome.  Similarly,  NHEJ  after  DSB  was  found  to  be  a 
common pathway in the genomic reduction of A. thaliana 
[82].

The genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies) sheds another 
interesting view on genomic evolution in gymnosperms. It is 
the only genome sequenced in gymnosperms [62] and the 
largest genome among the first 50 sequenced plant genomes 
[28]. The sequence data showed no evidence of WGD since 
the  divergence  with  angiosperms  350  million  years  ago. 
Surprisingly,  LTR  retrotransposons  of  the  Norway  spruce 
genome are mostly low-copy LTRs with 80% singletons. The 
large genome seems to have resulted from a slow but steady 
accumulation of diverse LTR retrotransposons, which was 
possible due to the lack of efficient elimination mechanisms, 
as evidenced by the fact that other pine species also have 
low-copy  LTRs  [80].  The  24-nucleotide  small  RNAs  are 
involved in TE silencing [83], but expression of these small 
RNAs in Norway spruce is also low. The average gymno-
sperm  genomes  are  relatively  larger  than  those  of  angio-
sperms. But, the gymnosperms have not gone awry to obese 
genomes, as seen in some angiosperm species. More gymno-
sperm genome sequences will give some answers for this 
modest  modulation  of  LTR  retrotransposon  families  and 
genomic expansion in gymnosperms. 

Arabidopsis lyrata revealed several interesting phenomena 
on genomic contraction and expansion. It is an out-crossing 
relative to the self-pollinating model species A. thaliana. The 
A. lyrata genome is 1.6 times larger than that of A. thaliana 
[84]. Comparison of the two genomes revealed that there 
were  large-scale  genome  rearrangements,  but  most  diffe-
rences  in  genome  size  were  derived  from  hundreds  of 
thousands of small deletions in A. thaliana, mostly in non- 
coding  areas  and  retrotransposons  [84].  A  subsequent 
comparative study with other plant genomes showed that A. 
thaliana lost introns 6 times faster than A. lyrata [77]. In a 
genome-wide survey of synonymous substitution rates, A. 
thaliana  had  a  higher  mutation  rate  than  A.  lyrata,  which 
might  relate  to  the  higher  rate  of  intron  loss  and  rapid 
genome reduction [85]. In the mutational hazard hypothesis 
[86], non-coding DNA is prone to accumulate deleterious 
mutations and be purged. So, with the high mutation rate in 
A. thaliana and intron loss, the DNA loss process may still be 
ongoing  in  A.  thaliana  genomes,  suggesting  pervasive 
selection for smaller genomes [84]. 

Epigenetics and Genome Size

Transposon  insertions  and  copy  number  increases  are 
potentially  detrimental  to  the  host  genome.  As  a  conse-
quence, eukaryotic genomes employ epigenetic surveillance 
systems that allow TEs to be under-controlled. Ironically, 
however, Nina Fedoroff proposed a somewhat different view 
on plant genome size variations with transposable elements 
in  her  seminal  AAAS  presidential  address:  “I  argue  that 

transposable elements accumulate in eukaryotic genomes because of, 
not despite, epigenetic silencing mechanisms” [26]. Nevertheless, 
epigenetic regulations of the transposable elements are the 
first line of defense against uncontrolled transposable ele-
ment  proliferation  [75].  Epigenetic  mechanisms  regulate 
gene  expression  and  do  not  involve  changes  in  DNA  se-
quence. They include DNA methylation [83, 87, 88], chro-
matin remodeling [89], and siRNAs [88, 89]. By genomic, 
epigenomic,  and  population  genetic  analyses  with  A. 
thaliana, Hollister and Gaut [83] presented three results: i) 
gene expression is negatively correlated with the density of 
methylated TEs, ii) methylated TEs near genes are under 
purifying selection, but unmethylated TEs or TEs far from 
genes are not under purifying selection, and iii) TE inser-
tions are distributed by age and methylation status, so that 
older, methylated TEs are farther from genes. Thus, host 
silencing  of  TEs  near  genes  has  deleterious  effects  on 
neighboring gene expression, resulting in the preferential 
loss of methylated TEs from gene-rich euchromatic regions. 
The young LTRs near genes are targeted for DNA methy-
lation by guidance of 24-nt small interfering RNA, which 
results  in  the  silencing  of  LTRs  as  well  as  silencing  of 
expression of nearby genes [83, 88]. The comparison of A. 
thaliana with its LTR-laden and larger relative A. lyrata can 
back up this view, because LTRs in A. thaliana are further 
from genes by more effective purging than those of A. lyrata 
[84, 88]. So, it is an evolutionary trade-off in which bene-
ficial  TE  silencing  casts  a  fitness  cost  by  the  deleterious 
effects on the expression of nearby genes [83]. 

In  maize,  the  mop1  mutant  has  a  deficiency  of  RNA- 
dependent RNA polymerase, which is a component of the 
RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway [89]. In a global 
gene expression analysis of the mop1 mutant, most of the 
class 2 DNA transposons (78%) showed increased expres-
sion,  but  68%  of  the  analyzed  class  1  retrotransposons 
showed decreased expression [90]. Several histone deace-
tylases,  enzymes  involved  in  heterochromatin  formation, 
increased  their  expression  in  the  mop1  mutant,  implying 
increased heterochromatin formation in the mutant. Thus, 
there are several pathways that lead to TE silencing, and 
these  pathways  interact  with  each  other,  so  that  some 
families are rigorously suppressed but expression of some 
families  is  relaxed,  which  permits  a  rapid  burst  of  some 
transposable families in a short period of time [84, 91].

subclasses Lilieae and Tulipeae in the Lilioideae subfamily 
harbor large genomes in the Liliaceae family. By comparative 
analysis of the relationship of genome size with phylogenetic 
among  78  species  in  Liliaceae,  Leitch  et  al.  [92]  demon-
strated that the ancestral genome size of the Liliaceae species 
was 6.73 pg, and punctuated genome size evolution occurred 
twice in Liliaceae. The first genome size evolution was at the 
base  of  the  polytomy  divergence  in  Liliaceae,  which  was 
associated  with  a  shift  from  the  smaller  genomes  to  the 
larger genomes of the Lilioideae (median C value, 14.2‒50.9 
pg) and Medeoloideae (median C value, 14.2‒18.9 pg) sub-
families. Table 2 shows the genomic features of two genera, 
Lilium and Fritillaria, in the Lilioideae subfamily. The second 
genomic evolution was at the divergence of Lilioideae from 
Medeoloideae, which was about 12 million years ago [93]. 
Punctuated  genomic  evolution  that  led  to  speciation  was 
also observed at the molecular level in other species [94]. 
The subfamily Medeoloideae is a sister subfamily to Lilio-
ideae in the Liliaceae family. While the species in Medeo-
loideae  bear  rhizomes,  inconspicuous  flowers,  fleshy  ani-
mal-dispersed fruits, and broad reticulate-veined leaves, the 
species  in  Lilioideae  show  bulbs,  showy  flowers,  wind- 
dispersed seeds, and narrow parallel-veined leaves in open 
habitats [93, 95]. Because these ecological shifts and the 
adaptive morphological features coincided with the appea-
rance of a large genome size, an adaptive role of genome size 
in Lilioideae is suggested—i.e., if the large genome has any 
selective advantage. However, as argued by Leitch et al. [92], 
there was no tendency toward increasing genome size from 

the ancestral species, having about 6.73 pg. Their proposal 
was that the large genomes of Lilioideae were a necessary or 
random consequence, simply due to the large diversification 
at the base of the clade. Oliver et al. [96] proposed a theory 
that genomic size evolution is proportional to genome size, 
with  the  fastest  rates  occurring  in  the  larger  genomes, 
among 20 major eukaryotic clades. So, the larger genomes of 
Lilium and Fritillaria in Lilioideae might have drifted away to 
even larger genomes with an increased rate of genome size 
evolution [92]. 

Although species in the genus Lilium have been known to 
carry large genomes, studies of transposable elements have 
not been carried out extensively. The genome of the species 
in the genus Lilium spans from 32.8 to 47.9 pg, with a mean 
value of 39.6 pg [92]. A Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon, del-1, was 
isolated from Lilium henryi [86]. Del-1 Ty3/gypsy was present 
in  approximately  13,000  copies  in  the  L.  henryi  genome, 
which accounts for 1% of the genome of L. henryi. By DNA 
reassociation analysis, Joseph et al. [97] showed that Cot1 
repeated  DNAs  constitute  2.2%  of  the  L.  henryi  genome, 
whereas they constitute 9.7% in L. longiflorum. In a Southern 
blot analysis with 14 Lilium species, del-1 Ty3/gypsy retro-
transposons showed high copy variation, at least a 100-fold 
difference,  among  Lilium  species,  implying  that  the  del-1 
Ty3/gypsy element was highly active after divergence of the 
genus Lilium. The integration time of del-1 Ty3/gypsy was 
estimated to be about 0.6 million years ago (mya) in L. henryi 
and  1.6  mya  in  L.  longiflorum  [16].  Del-2  is  a  LINE-like 
element found in Lilium speciosum [98, 99]. Del-2 is 4.5 kb in

size and is present in 240,000 copies, constituting about 4% 
of  the  L.  speciosum  genome  [99].  Del-2-related  sequences 
were  also  highly  abundant  in  Tulip  and  bluebells  (Scilla 
nonsripta, both in Liliaceae), Hyacinthaceae, Amarylidaceae, 
and Alliaceae plants but less abundant in other monocots, 
such  as  Poaceae,  implying  that  they  are  specific  to  the 
Liliaceae family. LINEs are highly abundant in mammals, but 
they are scant in most plant species [23, 31]. However, the 
del-2 LINE-like elements are highly abundant in species of 
the Liliaceae family. LIREs (lily retroelement) are Ty1/copia 
retrotransposons  isolated  from  L.  longiflorum  [16].  LIREs 
showed  approximately  the  same  abundance  as  the  del-1 
Ty3/gypsy  retrotransposon  in  species  of  the  genus  Lilium. 
However, unlike the del2 LINEs, LIRE Ty1/copia retrotran-
sposons are absent in other species, such as tulips, Narcissus, 
Ipheion, Hosta longgips, and O. sativa. We mined eight Ty1/copia 
elements from Lilium lancifolium (unpulished). Characteriza-
tion of these retrotransposons may provide more informa-
tion on the Ty1/copia retrotransposons in the genus Lilium. 
The genus Fritillaria is a sister genus in the Lilieae subclass in 
the  Lilioideae  subfamily.  The  Fritillaria  species  harbor  an 
even larger genome (min. 30.8 pg, max. 89.2 pg, mean 50.9 
pg) than Lilium species [92]. In F. affinis (1C = 45.6 pg) and 
F. imperialis (1C = 43.0 pg), chromovirus-like sequences and 
Tat lineage Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons are predominant in 
both species [100]. Not only do retrotransposons contribute 
to  the  gigantic  Fritillaria  genome,  satellite  DNAs  also 
FriSAT1  repeats  also  contribute  highly  to  the  Fritillaria 
genome. The FriSAT1 repeats constitute approximately 26% 
of the F. affinis genome [100]. With these results, they argued 
that  there  are  no  predominant  repeats  that  track  the 
increasing/decreasing  trends  of  genome  size  in  Fritillaria. 
Instead, many diverse families of transposable elements and 
repeats constitute the gigantic Fritillaria genomes. Thus, as 
evidenced with full- genome sequencing of the large genome 
of  Norway  spruce  (P.  abies)  [80,  82],  the  highly  obese 
Fritillaria  genome  may  have  had  happened  partly  by  the 
failure  of  the  repeats  to  be  purged  effectively  to 
counterbalance the amplification of retrotransposons. 

Conclusion

Large fractions of eukaryotic genomes contain repeated 
DNA sequences that are mostly transposable elements. The 
large quantity of accurate genomic information in various 
plant taxa and the development of computational biology 
have revolutionized our conventional view on transposable 
elements, which were once dishonorably christened ‘selfish 
DNAs’ and have now been switched to ‘genome treasure.’ 
Genome size variation is enormously variable in plant taxa, 
and most of this variation is due to the variable amounts of 

class  1  LTR  retrotransposons  in  the  host  genomes.  The 
‘copy-and-paste’ retrotransposition of the class 1 LTR retro-
transposons  left  the  plant  genomes  to  get  into  genomic 
obesity.  The  uncontrollable  amplification  of  class  1  LTR 
retrotransposons could have caused a negative effect on host 
genomes not only by the various mutational effects but also 
by the large genomic constraint in replication. Thus, epige-
netic surveillance systems control the activity of retrotran-
sposons and counterbalance genome size amplification by 
genome-purging mechanisms, such as illegitimate or une-
qual recombination between LTRs and NHEJ. The epigenetic 
surveillance systems, however, might have been weakened 
in certain times, and some retrotransposons in certain line-
ages  had  escaped  the  epigenetic  radar  to  have  an  ampli-
fication burst in a relatively short period of time during plant 
evolution and diversification. However, this specific ampli-
fication might have not happened in all plant taxa, as seen in 
the Norway spruce, which has a relatively larger genome 
than average angiosperm genomes. Although we need more 
gymnosperm  sequence  information,  the  steady  accumu-
lation of diverse LTR retrotransposons with weakly efficient 
elimination mechanisms can also account for the genome 
sizes in gymnosperms. In addition to LTR retrotransposon 
amplification,  as  seen  in  Lilium  and  Fritillaria,  non-LTR 
retrotransposons  and  simple  satellite  DNAs  also  contri-
buted  to  the  large  genomes  that  happened  partly  by  the 
failure of effective purging to counterbalance the growth of 
genome size. Biological (hybridization, alien chromatin in-
trogression, environmental stresses, or pathogens, etc) and 
nonbiological  (temperature  shift,  UV  irradiation,  etc.) 
stresses  might  have  caused  the  weakening  of  epigenetic 
surveillance to allow genome bursts in certain species. So, 
the current genomes may be the outcome of a long battle of 
repeat sequence amplification and genome-purging systems 
in ambient environments during plant evolution.
