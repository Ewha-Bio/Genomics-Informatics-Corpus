In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), copy number variation (CNV) is a major component of human genetic 
diversity.  Among  many  whole-genome  analysis  platforms,  SNP  arrays  have  been  commonly  used  for  genomewide  CNV 
discovery. Recently, a number of CNV defining algorithms from SNP genotyping data have been developed; however, due to 
the fundamental limitation of SNP genotyping data for the measurement of signal intensity, there are still concerns regarding 
the possibility of false discovery or low sensitivity for detecting CNVs. In this study, we aimed to verify the effect of combining 
multiple CNV calling algorithms and set up the most reliable pipeline for CNV calling with Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 
data. For this purpose, we selected the 3 most commonly used algorithms for CNV segmentation from SNP genotyping data, 
PennCNV, QuantiSNP; and BirdSuite. After defining the CNV loci using the 3 different algorithms, we assessed how many of 
them overlapped with each other, and we also validated the CNVs by genomic quantitative PCR. Through this analysis, we 
proposed that for reliable CNV-based genomewide association study using SNP array data, CNV calls must be performed with 
at  least  3  different  algorithms  and  that  the  CNVs  consistently  called  from  more  than  2  algorithms  must  be  used  for 
association analysis, because they are more reliable than the CNVs called from a single algorithm. Our result will be helpful 
to set up the CNV analysis protocols for Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 genotyping data.

Introduction

Human  genome  variation  has  facilitated  the  under-
standing of inter-individual phenotypic differences [1, 2]. In 
addition to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), it is 
widely accepted that large-scale DNA structural variation, 
termed copy number variation (CNV), is a major component 
of human genetic diversity [2, 3]. Genomewide SNP geno-
typing data can be used for CNV calling [4]; therefore, if we 
can get reliable CNV calls from the SNP genotyping data, a 
CNV-based genomewide association study (GWAS) can be 
realized. Among many whole-genome CNV analysis plat-
forms, SNP arrays have been  suggested as a resource for 
CNV discovery due to their ubiquitous genome coverage and 
relatively  advantageous  resolution.  However,  despite  the 
importance  of  CNV-disease  association  analysis,  CNV 

calling  from  SNP  genotyping  data  has  not  been  well 
established. Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 5.0 is one of the 
commonly used SNP array platforms for SNP-GWAS as well 
as CNV analysis [5]. We previously validated the accuracy 
and  reproducibility  of  CNVs  called  from  Affymetrix  SNP 
array 5.0 data by comparing the CNV calls from 3 different 
array  platforms  using  NEXUS  software:  Affymetrix  SNP 
array 5.0, Agilent 2X244K CNV array, and NimbleGen 2.1M 
CNV array [6].

Recently, a number of CNV defining algorithms have been 
developed,  which  have  facilitated  the  CNV-based  GWAS 
[7-14]. However, due to the fundamental limitation of SNP 
genotyping  data  for  the  measurement  of  signal  intensity, 
there  are  still  concerns  regarding  the  possibility  of  false 
discovery or low  sensitivity for  detecting CNVs  [15, 16]. 
Indeed,  CNV  calling  is  dependent  on  the  types  of  array

platforms  and  analytic  tools.  Each  platform  and  calling 
algorithm has its own advantages and disadvantages; so, one 
single  algorithm  or  array  platform  is  not  always  best  for 
determination of CNVs [17-19]. Recently Pinto et al. [20] 
showed that different analytic tools applied to the same raw 
data typically yielded CNV calls with  ＜50% concordance 
and,  using  multiple  algorithms,  minimize  the  number  of 
false discoveries. To remedy the potential limitations of SNP 
array for CNV detection, more than one way of CNV calling 
by  using  several  different  segmentation  algorithms  are 
performed, and overlapped calls are used for GWAS analysis 
[21-24].

In this study, we tried to verify the effect of adopting mul-
tiple CNV calling algorithms and set up the most reliable 
pipeline for CNV calling with Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 
5.0 data. We selected the 3 most commonly used algorithms 
for CNV segmentation from SNP genotyping data, PennCNV, 
QuantiSNP, and BirdSuite. After defining the CNV loci using 
the 3 different algorithms, we assessed how many of them 
overlapped with each other, and we also validated the CNVs 
by genomic quantitative PCR (qPCR). Finally we concluded 
that CNVs that were consistently called from more than 2 
different calling algorithms are more reliable than the CNVs 
called from a single algorithm. Our result will be helpful to 
set  up  the  CNV  analysis  protocols  for  Affymetrix  Geno-
mewide SNP 5.0 genotyping data. 

Methods
Study materials

We  used  Affymetrix  Genomewide  SNP  5.0  genotyping 
data provided by the Korea Association Resource (KARE) 
consortium, Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES). 
As a control, we purchased a HapMap cell line, GM10851, 
from Coriell Institute for Medical Research (Camden, NJ, 
USA) and extracted genomic DNA using the DNeasy Blood 
& Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 

Pre-processing SNP array data 

Before  CNV  calling  procedures,  all  required  pre-pro-
cessing  procedures,  including  allele  correction,  summa-
rization,  and  background  correction,  were  performed  as 
described  previously  by  using  the  software  provided  by 
Affymetrix  [5].  In  brief,  background-corrected  data  were 
normalized using quantile normalization and summarized 
by median polish.

CNV calling

For  this  study,  Affymetrix  5.0  SNP  array  (Affymetrix, 
Santa Clara, CA, USA) data of 10 subjects were randomly 
selected from the KARE dataset for CNV calling. Affymetrix 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

5.0 data of NA10851 was used as a control. For defining 
CNVs,  we  choose  3  different  segmentation  algorithms, 
PennCNV  [25],  QuantiSNP  [26]  and  BirdSuite  [27]. 
PennCNV implements a hidden Markov model (HMM) and 
considers SNP allelic ratio distribution in addition to signal 
intensity. We only used CNVs from PennCNV with samples 
that had a standard deviation of log R ratio (LRR) smaller 
than 0.2, drift values of b-allele frequency (BAF_drift) smal-
ler than 0.01, and waviness factor between －0.05 and 0.05. 
For  QuantiSNP,  we  did  not  apply  any  criteria  for  sample 
filtering, since QuantiSNP uses an Objective Bayes Hidden- 
Markov  Model  (OB-HMM)  for  calibrating  the  model  for 
fixing the false positive error rate and maximum marginal 
likelihood to set other hyperparameters. It was originally 
developed for detecting CNVs from BeadArray SNP geno-
typing data of Illumina, but Affymetrix data also could be 
processed as long as they have probe signal intensities and 
B-allele frequencies. Birdsuite uses exclusive copy number 
analysis  routine  (Canary)  for  CNP  locus  and  HMM  for 
finding rare CNVs. It generates a logarithm of the odds ratio 
(LOD) value for each CNV that describes the likelihood of a 
CNV  relative  to  no  CNV  over  a  given  interval,  including 
flanking sequences. Of the BirdSuite calls, only the CNVs 
that have an LOD value smaller than 2 were used for further 
analysis. All 3 methods were used with default values, and 
no other option was added or changed.

Validation

To estimate the false discovery rate of our CNV-calling 
algorithm, CNVs were validated by genomic real-time qPCR. 
For this purpose, we randomly selected 25 CNV loci and 
performed genomic qPCR using DNAs from study subjects 
who  showed  corresponding  CNVs on  that  loci.  The  PCR 
primers  used  in  this  study  were  designed  using  the 
PrimerQuest  program  (http://www.idtdna.com/Scitools/ 
Applications/Primerquest). To verify the specificity of the 
PCR reactions under the unified denaturation temperature 
(60oC), we performed PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis 
for  each  primer  set.  We  also  screened  the  University  of 
California  Santa  Cruz  (UCSC)  database  (http://genome. 
ucsc.edu/)  to  confirm  the  unique  sequence  without  any 
repeat sequences in the primers. Sequence information of 
the primers for genomic qPCR validation is listed in Table 1.
Ten microliters of the reaction mixture contained 10 ng of 
genomic  DNA,  SYBR  Premix  Ex  Taq  TM  II  (TaKaRaBio, 
Shiga, Japan), 1× ROX (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), and 10 pmol 
of primers. Thermal cycling conditions consisted of 1 cycle of 
10 s at 95oC, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95oC, 10 s at 61oC, 
and 20 s at 72oC. All PCR experiments were repeated twice, 
and amplification efficiencies for both target and reference 
genes were evaluated using a standard curve over 1：5 serial

ΔΔCT, where ΔCt is the difference in threshold cycles for 
the  sample  in  question  normalized  against  the  reference 
gene (RNaseP) and expressed relative to the value obtained 
by  calibrator  DNA  (NA10851  and  Promega  DNA),  as 
described elsewhere [28]. 

Results and Discussion

The general characteristics of the CNV calls from the 3 
algorithms are shown in Table 2. The total number of CNV 
calls from the 3 algorithms was similar-range 814 to 1,362. 
The median size of the CNVs called by PennCNV (12.9 kb) 
were bigger than the other 2 algorithms (7.5 kb and 7.9 kb). 

The size of the CNVs consistently detected by 2 or more 
algorithms  was  generally  bigger  than  that  of  the  CNVs 
detected by a single method. For example, the average sizes 
of the CNVs that were detected from all 3 algorithms, 2 
algorithms, and 1 method were 107 kb, 73.2 kb, and 15.9 kb, 
respectively (Table 3). Fig. 1 shows the examples of different 
sizes of CNVs according to the LRR distribution of gain- and 
loss-type CNV regions, depending on how many algorithms 
detected the CNV in that region. These data suggest that 
larger-sized CNVs are generally more prominent; so, they 
can  be  relatively  easily  detected  by  any  segmentation 
method, regardless of the algorithm. But, detection of the 
smaller-sized  CNVs  can  be  affected  more  easily  by  the 
characteristics of the CNV defining algorithm; so, they can

probes. Under this criterion, the number of CNV calls from 
the 3 algorithms was reduced down from 295 to 385, while 
the  median  size  became  bigger-50  kb  by  PennCNV  and 
QuantiSNP  and  23.5  kb  by  BirdSuite  (Table  2).  In  this 
condition, same as above, the size of the CNVs consistently 
detected by 2 or more algorithms was generally bigger than 
that of the CNVs detected by a single method (Table 3). 

In terms of the number of CNVs consistently identified by 
different algorithms, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV 
algorithm,  48.6%  (396/814  CNVs)  was  detected  by  2  or 
more  algorithms,  and  only  4.9%  (40/814  CNVs)  was 
detected by all 3 algorithms. Similarly, of the CNV calls using 
QuantiSNP, 42.9% (466/1,087 CNVs) was detected by 2 or 
more  algorithms  and  only  3.9%  (42/1,087  CNVs)  was 
detected by all 3 algorithms. However, in the case of the 
BirdSuite algorithm, although the number of CNV calls was 
the biggest, only 9.6% (131/1,362 CNVs) was detected by 2 
or more algorithms and 2.9% (40/1,362 CNVs) was detected 
by all 3 algorithms. Taken together, only 17% of the total 
CNV calls (465/2,735 CNVs) were defined by more than 2 
algorithms, and only 1.5% (40/2,735 CNVs) was defined by 
all 3 algorithms (Table 3). In the filtering condition of ＞7 
consecutive  probes,  the  number  of  CNVs  consistently 
identified  by  different  algorithms  was  improved.  For 
example, of the CNV calls using the PennCNV algorithm, 
76.6%  (226/295  CNVs)  was  detected  by  2  or  more 
algorithms and only 23.4% (69/295 CNVs) was detected 
uniquely by PennCNV. QuantiSNP calls showed a similar 
trend. However, even under this condition, 92.5% (356/385 
CNVs)  of  BirdSuite  calls  were  unique  (Table  3).  All  the 
CNVs  consistently  detected  by  2  algorithms  were  from 
PennCNV  and  QuantiSNP,  while  no  CNVs  that  were 
detected  by  the  BirdSuite  algorithm  were  consistently 
detected by 2 algorithms, with only 1 exception. These data 
suggest  that  CNV  calls  from  SNP  genotyping  depend 
substantially on the characteristics of calling algorithms, and 
only part of the CNV calls from each algorithm seems to be 
reliable. Therefore, CNVs identified from SNP genotyping 
data  must  be  validated  as  completely  as  possible,  and 
especially in the case of using a single calling algorithm, the 
CNVs must be validated more carefully. Filtering the CNV

A  recent  report  examining  the  impact  of  inaccuracy  of 
CNV  detection  from  SNP  genotyping  data  revealed  that 
CNVs,  defined  as  the  copy  number  changes  of  ＞7  con-
secutive probes, were fairly reliable in case of deletion type 
CNVs [29]. In our previous study exploring the CNV profiles 
of  Koreans  using  an  Affymetrix  array,  we  suggested  the 
filtering condition of CNV call as ＞6 consecutive probes to 
be reliable [5]. Therefore, to make more reliable conditions 
in this study, we filtered the CNV calls as ＞7 consecutive

calls by the number of consecutive probes can improve the 
reliability of CNV calls.

To validate the CNVs identified from 3 different algori-
thms in this study, we randomly selected 25 CNV regions 
across the whole chromosomes. The genomic qPCR vali-
dation  results  are  listed  in  Table  4.  In  case  of  the  CNVs 
identified by all 3 algorithms, 71.4% (5/7) of the consistency 
was  observed  between  the  CNV  call  and  genomic  qPCR 
result. Of the CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms, 
57.6%  (19/33)  was  consistent.  Of  the  unique  CNV  calls 
defined by just a single algorithm, only 38.3% (18/47) was 
consistent, but the other 61.7% (28/46) was not consistent. 
In the case of the CNVs defined as ＞7 consecutive probes, 
the  consistency  was  generally  improved-47.8%  (unique 
CNVs), 62.2% (CNVs identified by more than 2 algorithms), 
and  83.3%  (CNVs  identified  by  all  3  algorithms).  These 
results indicate that CNV calls from 2 or more algorithms are 
more reliable than those from single algorithms. CNV calls 

from all 3 algorithms are, of course, the most reliable, but 
this  is  too  stringent;  so,  the  number  of  CNVs  is  not 
applicable for GWAS analysis.  

In this study, we aimed to verify the effect of adopting 
multiple CNV calling algorithms and set up the most reliable 
pipeline for CNV calling with Affymetrix Genomewide SNP 
5.0  data.  We  found  that  CNVs  defined  by  a  single  CNV 
calling algorithm may not reliable enough for further GWAS 
study, regardless of the types of algorithms. Based on our 
findings,  we  propose  that  for  reliable  CNV-based  GWAS 
using SNP array data, CNV calls must be performed with at 
least  3  different  algorithms,  and  the  CNVs  consistently 
called from more than 2 methods must be used for asso-
ciation analysis.
