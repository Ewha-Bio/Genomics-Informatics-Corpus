Abstract 

The latest measure of the relative evolutionary age of 
protein structurefamilies  was  applied  (based  on 
taxonomic  diversity)  using  the  protein  structural 
interactome  map  (PSIMAP).  It confirms that,  in 
general,  protein  domains,  which  are  hubs  in  this 
interaction  network,  are  older than  protein  domains 
with fewer interaction  partners.  We  apply  a hypoth(cid:173)
esis  of 'biological  network evolution'  to explain  the 
positive  correlation  between  interaction and  age.  It 
agrees to the previous suggestions that proteins have 
acquired an increasing number of interaction partners 
over time via the  stepwise  addition  of new  inter(cid:173)
actions.  This  hypothesis is shown  to  be  consistent 
with the scale-free  interaction  network topologies 
proposed  by other groups. Closely co-evolved  struc(cid:173)
tural  interaction  and  the dynamics of network evo(cid:173)
lution  are  used  to explain  the  highly conserved  core 
of protein interaction pathways, which exist across all 
divisions of life.

Introduction 

There are around 300 distinct classification  schemes  used 
to  relate  over  140,000 species  and  sub-species  in  the 
NCBI  Taxonomy  database  (Wheeler eta/.,  2000)  (July 
2002).  This  'tree  of  life'  classifies  species  into  four 
superkingdoms,  namely:  eukaryota,  eubacteria,  archaea 
and viruses. The huge diversity of life is the result of billions

of years  of evolution  on  Earth.  However, the  basic core  of 
protein mediated metabolic pathways in all these species is 
relatively  homogeneous  (Benner eta/.,  1989;  Morowitz, 
1992; Morowitz,  1999). Furthermore, despite the continuing 
growth  in  the  quantity of  determined  protein  structures, 
sequences  and  even  whole  genomes,  the  rate  of  finding 
novel  protein  topologies  is  decreasing  (Fig.  1 ).  It  is 
probable that there are  no  more than 2,000 distinct protein 
topologies  in  nature  (Chothia,  1992;  Orengo  et at.,  1994; 
Alexandrov et at.,  1995;  Wang,  1996;  Zhang,  1997).  One 
can  ask  how  such  an  ancient  and  diverse  evolutionary 
history could  maintain  such  a  homogenous  biochemical 
backbone,  supported  by  so  few  protein  topologies.  What 
constraints  prevent  life  from  using  unique  biochemical 
pathways  and  discovering  new  protein  folds?  The 
proposed  scale  free  topology  of  the  interaction  network 
(Jeong et at.,  2000), the structural interaction network (Park 
eta/,  2001 ),  the  closely  co-evolved  nature  of  protein 
interactions  (Bennett et a/.,  1994;  Marcotte  et at.,  1999; 
Fraser eta/.,  2002)  and  the  rate  of  network  evolution 
(Kauffman  et a/.,  1993)  contribute  significantly to  an 
account  of  these  observations.  We  have  proposed  that 
protein interaction networks are conserved in evolution and 
highly  interacting  groups  are  relatively  old  and  functionally 
important  (Park  and  Bolser,  2001 ).  Here,  we  explain  it 
further  with  the  latest  data  by  using  the  old  concept  of 
biological  Network  Evolution  applied  to  protein  structural 
interactome. 

Currently  the  structural  classification  of  proteins 
database  (SCOP)  (Murzin  et at.,  1995)  defines  around 
1 ,000  distinct  protein  fold  types  as  Superfamilies  (termed 
as  structurefamilies  in  this  paper),  denoting  homology 
between  their  representative  protein  structural  domains 
(domain) members. A fold in SCOP is defined solely on the 
basis  of  structural  similarity  between  domains. 
Structurefamilies therefore  divide  folds  into  evolutionary 
groups,  using  sequence  and  functional  similarities. 
However,  around  90%  of  the  folds  defined  in  SCOP  are 
thought to  have  a single  evolutionary origin,  constituting  a 
single superfamily. Structurefamilies (superfamilies) are the 
most useful  domain  classification  for comparing  structures 
and  functions  in  bioinformatics  by  virtue  of  their structural 
and phylogenetic classification. 

Although  the  rate  at  which  new  protein  structures  are 
deposited  in  the  Protein  Data  Bank (PDB)  (Berman et a/., 
2000)  is  increasing  (Fig.  1 c),  the  rate  of  discovering  new 
structurefamilies  is  decreasing  (Fig.  1 b).  The  recent

Fig.  1. (A} The  number of  new folds added to the  PDB  (Berman  et al.,  2000)  since  1980. The trend shows a general  decrease,  with  a 
slight recent upturn. New folds are assessed by the combinatorial extension (CE) algorithm {Shindyalov & Bourne,  1998). (B) The number 
of SCOP folds,  superfamilies and families per domain (Murzin et al.,  1995) in the PDB. The trend shows increasing domain redundancy 
within  the  groups.  (C)  The  total  number of  new  structures  deposited  in  the  PDB  per year.  Both  the  trends  in  A and  B oppose  the 
increasing number of structures deposited in the PDB each year. 

conservative  structurefamily  assignment  of  56  genomes 
covered  between  40-67%  of  the  total  detected  genes  in 
eukaryotes  and  eubacteria  (- 100,000  genes)  and 
between  31-54%  of  the  total  detected  genes  in 
archaebacteria  (- 10,000 genes)  (Gough  et a/.,  2001 ). 
Given  that  a  significant  portion  of  the  unassigned  genes 
may represent trans-membrane  and  other proteins,  not 
assigned  to  structures  due  to  experimental  difficulty  in 
structure  determination,  it  is  reasonable  to  suggest  that 
there  are  now enough  soluble  protein  structurefamily data 
in  the  PDB to  make a global  map of structurally observed 
structurefamily  interactions.  PSI-MAP  (Protein  Structural 
lnteractome MAP)  (Park eta/., 2001)  is the first such  map 
(Fig.  2).  It  also  compared  for the  first  time  the  protein 
experimental  interaction  information  such  as  yeast  two 
hybrid system  (Uetz eta/., 2000)  with  structural  interaction 
information. 

The  criteria  for  assigning  interactions  in  PSI-MAP  is 
strictly structural  and  exhaustive;  distinct pairs  of  domains 
in  the  PDB  are  denoted  as  interacting  if  they  share  5  or 
more residue - residue contacts within 6 angstroms or less 
(5-5  rule  of protein  structure  interaction).  These  criteria 
were  chosen  as  being  the  most  discriminative  within  a 
range  of other criteria  (Fig.  3).  Different contact algorithms 
yield  qualitatively  similar  results  (Park eta/.,  2001 ).  By 
using  the  SCOP  domain  definition  (version  1.59  unless 
otherwise stated) it is possible that these criteria will denote 
covalently  linked  domains  as  interacting.  These 
interactions  (intra-interaction)  are  in  the  minority, 
accounting  for  30%  of  the  (11281)  domain-domain 
interactions  observed.  For a  breakdown  of the  651 
observed  structurefamily-structurefamily  interactions  see 

Table  1.  The  number of  structurefamilies  displaying 
interaction  through  both  covalently  and  non-covalently 
linked  domains  (73  interacting  structurefamilies 
representing  3,337  interacting  domains)  indicates  that 
observed domain fusion events in the PDB are extensive. 
The  validity  of  assigning  the  only  intra-interacting 
structurefamily pairs  as  interacting  is  two  fold.  Firstly, 
domain  proximity  is  a  result  of  the  selective  pressure  to 
associate  genes that  physically  interact  (Marcotte eta/., 
1999;  Dandekar eta/.,  1998;  Doolittle  1999;  Enright eta/., 
1999).  Secondly,  domain  proximity  is  more  generally 
indicative  of  indirect functional  associations  between 
domains  (Marcotte  eta/.,  1999;  Overbeek eta/.,  1999; 
Enright  &  Ouzounis,  2001 ).  Domain  fusion  has  been 
successfully  used  to  predict  protein  interaction  from 
sequence information alone (see Huynen eta/., 2000) and 
as  a  hypothesis for the  evolution  of  homo  (Bennett eta/., 
1994) and hetero (Marcotte eta/.,  1999) dimers (see Table 
1 for  PSIMAP  multimer information).  In  addition,  it  has 
been  observed  that  intra-domain  interfaces  have  strong 
similarities  to  inter-domain  interfaces  within  multi-domain 
proteins (Miller,  1989; Tsai eta/., 1996; Jones eta/., 2000). 
Using  the  expert  SCOP  domain  and  superfamily 
definitions  to  predict  superfamily-superfamily  interactions 
from  observed  domain  fusion  events  overcomes  some  of 
the technical  problems associated with  the  identification of 
homology  and  fusion  encountered  using  other 
computational  methods to predict interaction  (Overbeek et 
a/.,  1999;  Enright & Ouzounis,  2001 ).  PSI-MAP  therefore 
represents a robust and reliable method of computationally 
predicting protein interaction. 

It has been argued that the PDB is a fair representation

Values  in  parentheses give  percent of the  total  number of structurefamily 
interactions. The large proportion of inter chain homo multimer contacts in 
the  PBD could  be the  result of unrecognised crystal  contact structures.  In 
future the Protein Quaternary Structure (PQS) server (Henrick & Thornton, 
1998) will be used to construct PSIMAP to alleviate this problem 

of all the soluble protein structurefamilies which  may exist. 
However,  given  the  combinatorial  effect,  it  is  unlikely that 
the  PDB  covers  a  representative  set  of  pair-wise 
structurefamily  interactions.  Importantly,  extending  the 
repertoire  of  predicted  structurefamily-structurefamily 
interactions  by  using  structurally  annotated  genomic 
sequence  data  does  not  alter the  distribution  of  observed 
interactions  (Park eta/.,  2001;  Apic  eta/.,  2001a;  Apic et 
a/.,  2001b).  Thus  it  is  likely that  the  relative  distribution  of 
interactions  in  PSIMAP  (which  forms  the  basis  of  our 
results  and  discussion)  will  reflect  the  distribution  of  a 
hypothetical  'complete'  map. 

Another criticism which has been levelled at PSI-MAP is 
that the variance  in  the  number interactions assigned to  a 
structurefamily could  be biased  by the  number domains in 
the PDB assigned to that structurefamily. Fig. 4 shows that 
only  a weak  correlation  exists  between  the  number of 
domain interactions for a structurefamily and the number of 
unique  structurefamily  interactions  it has.  This  correlation 
coefficient  falls  to  0.16  upon  removal  of  the  four  most 
prominent  outliers.  A similar correlation  is  measured 
between the number of structurefamily interactions and the 
absolute  number of domains  for that  structurefamily  (data 
not shown). 

It  has  been  suggested  that  artificial  structures  in  the 
PDB  my  affect  the  overall  distribution  of  structurefamily 
interactions discussed here.  PSI-MAP is constructed using 
only structurefamilies from  SCOP class  1 to 4.  In all,  there 
are  only  12  multi-domain  synthetic  proteins  in  these 
classes.

Fig. 5. A log-log plot of the number of structurefamily interactions 
against the  frequency  of  structurefamilies  with  this  number of 
interactions.  The linear fit to a log-log  plot indicates a power law 
frequency  distribution,  which  is  broken  by the  'one  interaction 
partner' class of tructurefamilies.  Traces of the familiar dove tale 
distribution can be seen from left to right, caused by an increased 
variance associated with  lower frequency  events. The upper left 
hand  side,  however,  is  usually quite  linear,  suggesting  that  the 
lower  than  expected  number  of  'one  interaction  partner' 
structurefamilies may be significant.  Linear regression of the log(cid:173)
log transformed data gives a correlation coefficient of 0.9. 

interactions at  the  structurefamily  level.  Structurefamilies 
have various degrees of  'interactability' , and the interaction 
frequency distribution obeys a power law (Fig. 5). 
To  assess  the  functional  and  evolutionary  differences 
between the most interactive and the least interactive folds, 
we  use the  latest  HIINFOLD  and  LOINFOLD  comparison 
sets  (Park  and  Bolser,  2001 ):  high  interaction 
structurefamilies (HIINFOLD, see supplement Table A) and 
low  interaction  structurefamilies  (LOINFOLD,  see 
supplement Table  B).  The  sixteeri  HIINFOLD  struc(cid:173)
turefamilies  (with  at  least seven  other interacting partners) 
have  functions  related  to  glycolysis;  oxidative 
phosphorylation; catabolism and nucleotide syntheses, well 
as  DNA  binding,  replication  and  metabolic  regulatory 
processes.  The  group  contains  functionally  important 
domains,  often  and  found  in  core  biochemical  pathways 
(Park eta/., 2001; Apic eta/., 2001 a; Apic eta/., 2001 b). By 
contrast the  160  LOINFOLD  structurefamilies  (each  with 
only one structurefamily interaction) contains only 91  (57%) 
structurefamilies  with  at  least  one  assigned  enzyme 
classification  (see  methods  section  for  details  of the 
functional  assignment),  covering  a total  of -130 distinct 
enzyme reactions. 

The  latest functional  analysis  of  HIINFOLD  and 
LOINFOLD  supports  the  previous  observation  that the 
absolute  number of  protein-protein  interactions  correlates

Taxonomic Diversity 

Fig. 6. The average number of structurefamily interaction partners 
is  plotted  for  structurefamilies  in  different  'taxonomic  diversity' 
groups. The taxonomic diversity of a structurefamily is simply the 
number of superkingdoms in  which that structurefamily has been 
identified. 

with the lethality of knock out mutation  (Jeong eta/., 2001 )(cid:173)
Thus  PSI-MAP  reflects  the  functional  importance  of 
structurefamilies  by  showing  number  of  interactions  they 
have. 

Protein phylogeny, age and interaction 
The occurrence of specific structurefamilies within  different 
branches  of  the  tree  of  life  gives  us  information  on 
structurefamily  evolution  and  spread.  By  inference,  this 
information  also  gives  us  the  relative  age  of  those 
structurefamilies (Ponting eta/., 1999; Anantharaman eta/., 
2001;  and  Snel  eta/.,  2002  for  recent  examples  of  this 
general  approach,  also  suggested  by  authors,  Park  and 
Bolser, 2001 ).  We used the NCBI taxonomic database and 
the  Swissprot (Bairoch  A.  & Apweiler  R.,  2000)  taxonomic 
annotation to collect this information (see methods). Simply 
counting the  occurrence of a structurefamily at the  highest 
level of the taxonomic tree  (the superkingdom)  allowed  us 
to  infer  an  evolutionary  age  (Table  2).  This  measure  of 
'taxonomic  diversity'  gives  each  structurefamily  an 
approximate relative rank age. 

In general, structurefamilies with  low taxonomic diversity 
are  less  likely to  have  interactions  than  those  found 
throughout  the  tree  of  life.  In  combination  with  this 
observation,  the  average  number  of  structurefamily 
interaction partners also increases with diversity (Fig. 6). 

As the  super-kingdom  level  is very high,  it is  necessary 

to verify this trend at higher resolution in the future work. 

Similar age-interaction  correlations  have  been  reported 
for metabolic networks  (Jeong eta/., 2000;  Wagner & Fell, 

2001 ).  Jeong  et a/.  analyse  the  metabolic  networks  of  43 
organisms,  representing  eubacteria,  eukaryota  and 
archaea.  In  this  analysis  4%  of  all  substrates  are found  to 
be  present  in  all  43  organisms.  These  ubiquitous 
metabolites  also  represent  the  most  highly  connected 
substrates  in  the  individual  metabolic  networks.  Similarly, 
the  "less  connected  substrates  ยท ยท ยท serve  as  educts  or 
products of species-specific enzymatic activities"  (Jeong et 
a/.,  2000).  Wagner and  Fell  concentrate  on  the  analysis of 
the  metabolic  network  of  Escherichia  coli.  They  ranked 
metabolites  according  to  local  and  global  network 
connectivity.  The  authors  state  that  "many  of  the  most 
highly  connected  metabolites  ยท ยท ยท have  a proposed  early 
evolutionary originยทยท  (Wagner & Fell, 2001 ). 

Network evolution hypothesis 
Recently,  it  was  discovered  that  many  'non-centralised' 
networks,  including  protein  interaction  networks,  have  a 
statistically similar connection  topology (Barabasi  & Albert, 
1999). In these  networks low and  intermediate numbers of 
connections are common,  while highly connected nodes in 
the  network  are  rare  but  statistically  significant 
(Dorogovtsev  & Mendes,  2001 ).  Typically,  the  connection 
distribution  is described by a power law and the network is 
said  to  be  'scale  free'  (Barabasi  & Albert,  1999).  Such 
networks  also  have  the  'small  world'  property,  whereby 
the network diameter is significantly smaller than a random 
network with the same number of nodes (Watts & Strogatz, 
1998).  Scale  free  networks  are  optimized  for the  small 
world  property,  as  randomly  removing  nodes  has  a very 
small  effect  on  the  network diameter  (Albert et a/.,  2000). 
Such  networks  are  said  to  be  robust,  as they can  tolerate 
random  deletions  without  changing  overall  connectivity 
(Albert  eta/.,  2000).  The  structural  interaction  network 
produced by PSI-MAP has such a scale free topology (Fig. 
5) (Park eta/., 2001 ). 

Using models of genetic  'network evolution'  it has been 
shown  that  as  the  allosteric  interactions  between  alleles 
increases,  the  rate  of  finding  fitter  ยทgenotypes' 

12  Genomics &  Informatics Vol.  1(1) 7-19, September 2003 

decreases(Kauffman,  1993).  In  these  models  'inter(cid:173)
actions'  limit the ability of a network to evolve. This  rate of 
network evolution  suggests  why  early,  functionally 
important and  interconnected  life  processes  are  slow to 
change  at  evolutionary time  scales.  Core  metabolic 
pathways  can  display  permutations  (for  example  loss  of 
specific  pathways  (Huynen  eta/.,  1999)),  however,  the 
overall  network  does  not  change  radically.  Ancient, 
fundamental biochemical pathways such as the TCA cycle 
and  glycolysis  are  fixed  in  their basic  architecture  early  in 
evolution. 

The  conclusion  that  the  rate  of  network  evolution 
combined with the scale free network topology can account 
for the  structurefamily  age-interaction  correlation  is 
somewhat  at  odds  with  Wagner,  2001.  Here  gene 
duplication  events are  identified in  the yeast genome,  and 
they  are  used  to  measure  of  the  rate  of  interaction 
formation and loss between paralogous genes. A high rate 
of  'interaction flux'  is estimated, suggesting 50% of all the 
network interactions change  every 300  million  years.  This 
estimate  is  based  on  the  assumption  that the  rate  of 
interaction  flux  after  gene  duplication  is  indicative  of  the 
overall rate.  However, there is evidence to suggest that this 
rate  could  be  specifically  accelerated  after  duplication 
(Long  & Langley,  1993;  Benton  et al.,  1997;  Cirera  & 
Aguade,  1998;  Tsaur  eta/.,  1998),  leading  to  an 
overestimate of total interaction flux. 

The  results  and  conclusions  in  this  paper corroborate 
the  results  of  Fraser eta/.,  2002.  Here,  exactly the  same 
principals  of  network  evolution  are  used  to  explain  an 
observed  negative  correlation  between  connectivity  and 
evolutionary  rate.  The  principals  are  interpreted  in  the 
biological  context  of  reciprocal  mutations  and  the 
coevolution of proteins in the interaction network. 

Network topology 
Although the scale free topology is said to be robust to the 
effects  of  random  deletion,  conversely,  the  non  random 
removal of the most highly connected nodes in the network 
rapidly  fragments  the  network  (Albert eta/.,  2000).  Why 
then  do  such  vulnerable  network topologies  exist  in 
nature? Two models of network growth have been used to 
account for the prevalence of scale free networks. The first, 
called  preferential  attachment  (Barabasi  & Albert,  1999), 
models  an  attachment  bias  towards  already  connected 
nodes. The second model assumes a constrained network 
diameter  (Puniyani  & Lukose,  2001)  and  the  random 
attachment  of  nodes.  The  diameter of  the  metabolic 
networks  from  a total  of 43  prokaryotes,  eukaryotes  and 
archae  are  all  very similar  (around  4),  despite the  varying 
number of metabolites and  complexity of these  organisms 
(Jeong  eta/.,  2000).  This  observation  is  not predicted  by 

preferential attachment, but is implicit in the second model. 
It  implies that the  metabolic  network diameter is a limiting 
factor  in  evolution.  The  same  constraint  has  been 
suggested  of  protein  interaction  networks  (Jeong  eta/., 
2001 ).  Both  models  of  network  growth  result  in  the  scale 
free topology, where old nodes accumulate more links over 
time  (without  the  specific  treatment  of  age  as  in 
Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2000). 

Protein topology 
The  secondary  structure  of  the  HIINFOLD  group  was 
mostly alpha and  beta (81 %,  alpha&beta and alpha+beta) 
with  only  one  all-alpha  structurefamily  (ARM  repeat 
a.118.1)  and  two  all-beta  superfamilies  (Immunoglobulin 
b.1.1  and  Trypsin-like  serine  proteases  b.47.1).  The  160 
LOINFOLD structurefamilies show a more even distribution 
among the classes (Fig. 7). 

Methods 
Taxonomic diversity 
Superkingdoms  were  assigned  to  SCOP  domains via  the 
species  identification  codes  of  SWISS-PROT  Protein 
Sequence  Database  (Bairoch  & Apweiler,  2000;  Release 
39.0,  May  2000).  Each  SCOP  domain  sequence  in 
PDB90D  (non-redundant  SCOP  domain  sequences  at 
90%  mutual  sequence  identity)  was  searched  against  a 
non  redundant  SWISS-PROT  (90%  mutual  sequence 
identity)  database.  The  search  was  done  using  the  PDB(cid:173)
ISL protocol (Park eta/., 1997; Teichmann eta/., 2000) for 
reliable  structural  assignments,  implemented  to  integrate 
with  a relational  database  for  easy  analysis.  Briefly,  the 
PSI-BLAST search algorithm (Altschul eta/., 1997) is used 
with  e-value 0.0005 and  up to  10 iterations.  These  values

'add-on'  interactions  with  constraints  (after  Puniyani  & 
Lukose,  2001).  New,  specialised  functions  are attached  to 
the  existing  network  of  protein  interactions,  and 
structurefamilies gradually acquire an  increasing number of 
interaction partners throughout the course of evolution. 

We  attribute  the  extremely  conserved  nature  of  core 
biochemical  pathways  to  a  mechanism  of  'network 
evolution'  where  relatively  ancient components  are  under 
strong optimization constraints through multiple interactions 
(Kauffman,  1993).  Thus,  in  general,  protein  struc(cid:173)
turefamilies  in  central  positions  in  the  structural  interaction 
network are more ancient than peripheral structurefamilies.

have  been  previously  verified  and  are  known  to  give  less 
than 1% false positives (Park eta/., 1998). Each statistically 
significant  match  (e-value  below  0.0005)  is  checked  for 
overlap  with  matches  from  other  PDB90D  domain 
sequence  with  different structurefamily classifications,  and 
these  'classification  collisions'  are  removed.  Further 
filtering  reduces  the  error  rate  even  further  (Park eta/., 
1997;  Teichmann  eta/.,  2000).  The  resulting  structural 
assignments  between  representative  SCOP  domains  and 
proteins  in  SWISS-PROT  give  the  structurefamily  -
superkingdom  correspondence.  These  data  were  used  to 
reliably  derive  the  taxonomic  diversity  for  each 
structurefamily(Fig. 6). 

Functional assignment 
Using the same method as above each superkingdom was 
assigned  to  a  list  of  SWISS-PROT  accession  numbers. 
These  numbers  give  links  to  entries  in  the  enzyme 
database  via  the  ENZYME  number.  A very  low  e-value 
threshold  was  used  to  select  the  most  reliable  enzyme 
classifications for each structurefamily. 

Summary 

The  latest functional  analysis  of  high  and  low  interaction 
groups  showed  most  highly  interacting  structurefamilies  in 
PSI-MAP  represent  functionally  important  enzymatic 
protein  domains  with  homologues  in  an  average  of  3.6 
superkingdoms.  The  least  interacting  structurefamilies  in 
represent fewer enzymatic protein domains, occurring in an 
average of 2 superkingdoms. 

In  all,  the  correlation  between  the  relative  age  and  the 
interactability of  protein  structurefamilies  is  consistent  with 
a hypothesis of  network growth that proceeds  via  random
