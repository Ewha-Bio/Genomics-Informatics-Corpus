Abstract

Together  with  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP), 
copy  number  variations  (CNV)  are  recognized  to  be  the 
major  component  of  human  genetic  diversity  and  used 
as  a  genetic  marker  in  many  disease  association 
studies.  Affymetrix  Genome-wide  SNP  5.0  is  one  of  the 
commonly  used  SNP  array  platforms  for  SNP-GWAS  as 
well  as  CNV  analysis.  However,  there  has  been  no  re-
port  that  validated  the  accuracy  and  reproducibility  of 
CNVs  identified  by  Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0.  In  this 
study,  we  compared  the  characteristics  of  CNVs  from 
the  same  set  of  genomic  DNAs  detected  by  three  differ-
ent  array  platforms;  Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0,  Agilent 
2X244K  CNV  array  and  NimbleGen  2.1M  CNV  array.  In 
our  analysis,  Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0  seems  to  detect 
CNVs  in  a  reliable  manner,  which  can  be  applied  for  as-
sociation  studies.  However,  for  the  purpose  of  defining 
CNVs  in  detail,  Affymetrix  Genome-wide  SNP  5.0  might 
be  relatively  less  ideal  than  NimbleGen  2.1M  CNV  array 
and  Agilent  2X244K  CNV  array,  which  outperform 
Affymetrix  array  for  defining  the  small-sized  single  copy 
variants.  This  result  will  help  researchers  to  select  a 
suitable  array  platform  for  CNV  analysis.

Introduction

Recent  progress  of  human  genome  mapping  has  facili-
tated  the  understanding  of  inter-individual  differences  in 
various  phenotypes  such  as  disease  susceptibility  and 
responsiveness  to  drugs  (Estivill  and  Armengol,  2007). 
Together  with  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP),  the 
large-scale  genomic  variations,  which  are  named  copy

number  variation  (CNV),  are  recognized  to  be  the  major 
component  of  human  genetic  diversity  (Freeman  et al., 
2006)  and  used  as  a  genetic  marker  in  many  disease 
association  studies. 
    Since  the  first  discovery  of  CNV  using  BAC  array 
platform,  the  microarray  platforms  for  defining  the  global 
CNVs  have  been  enormously  improved.  Iafrate  et al 
identified  255  CNVs  from  39  individuals  using  3K  BAC 
array  and  Sebat et al.  defined  76  CNVs  in  20  individuals 
using  oligonucleotide  array  based  ROMA  approach 
(representational  oligonucleotide  microarray  analysis) 
(Iafrate et al.,  2004;  Sebat et al.,  2004).  Due  to  the  im-
provement  of  technology  and  array  resolution,  the  size 
of  CNVs  has  been  getting  smaller  and  the  number  of 
CNVs  detected  per 
increasing. 
However,  defining  CNV  is  sensitive  to  choice  of  array 
platforms  and  detection  algorithms.  Indeed,  the  number 
and  size  of  CNVs  were  diverse  between  the  studies  us-
ing  different  platform  (Scherer  et al.,  2007).
    Among  many  whole-genome  CNV  analysis  platforms, 
SNP  arrays  have  been  commonly  used  for  CNV  discov-
ery  due  to  its  ubiquitous  genome  coverage  and  ad-
vantageous  resolution.  Also  in  Korea,  SNP  arrays  have 
been  frequently  applied  for  CNV-disease  association 
studies.  The  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  con-
sortium  used  the  Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0  genotyping 
data  of  8,848  individuals  provided  by  Korea  National 
Health  Institute  (KNIH)  for  studying  the  associations  be-
tween  genetic  variations  and  phenotypes.  Using  the 
same  dataset,  we  previously  reported  the  evolutionary 
and  functional  implications  of  the  CNVs  in  Korean  pop-
ulation  (Yim  et al.,  2010).
    Despite  the  popularity  of  SNP  arrays  in  studying 
CNVs,  there  are  concerns  regarding  possibility  of  false 
discovery  that  can  be  caused  by  one-dye  SNP  arrays. 
There  have  been  several  reports  comparing  the  ar-
ray-CGH  platforms  for  detecting  CNVs  (Baumbusch, 
2008;  Curtis  and  Lynch,  2010;  Hester et al.,  2009),  but 
there  has  been  no  report  that  validated  the  accuracy 
and  reproducibility  of  CNVs  identified  by  Affymetrix  SNP 
array  5.0.  In  this  study,  we  compared  the  characteristics 
of  CNVs  from  the  same  set  of  genomic  DNAs  detected 
by  three  different  array  platforms;  Affymetrix  SNP  array 
5.0,  Agilent  2X244K  CNV  array  and  NimbleGen  2.1M 
CNV  array. 

Methods

Study  subject

Genomic  DNA  was  isolated  from  two  HapMap  cell  lines, 
GM10851  and  GM15510  (Coriell,  Camden,  NJ,  USA) 
Ⓡ
  Blood  &  Tissue  Kit  (Qiagen,  Hilden, 
with  DNeasy
Germany).

Array  hybridization  and  data  processing

fragmentation  method  and 

For  CNV  defining  using  Affymetrix  Genome-wide  SNP 
5.0  platform,  array  hybridization  and  all  the  downstream 
data  preprocessing  procedures  including  allele  correc-
tion,  summarization  and  background  correction  were 
performed  as  described  previously  (Yim  et al.,  2010).
  For  Agilent  2X244K  CNV  array,  array  hybridization  and 
all  the  downstream  data  preprocessing  were  performed 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  In  brief, 
2ug  of  genomic  DNA  from  NA10851  and  NA15510  were 
digested  with  heat 
the 
NA10851  cell  line  was  labeled  with  Cy3-dUTP  and 
NA15510  was  labeled  with  Cy5-dUTP  using  Agilent 
Genomic  DNA  Enzymatic  Labeling  Kit  (Agilent  Techno-
logies,  Santa  Clara,  CA).  Labeled  DNAs  were  purified  by 
Amicon  Ultra-0.5  purification  column  (Millipore,  Billerica, 
MA)  and  then  pre-annealed  with  a  blocking  reagent 
(Agilent  technologies)  containing  Cot-1  DNA  (Connecta-
Gen,  Seoul,  Korea).  Array  hybridization  was  performed 
for  40  hours  at  65oC  and  20  rpm.  After  hybridization, 
the  arrays  were  washed  and  scanned  with  Agilent 
GA2565C  scanner  (Agilent  technologies).  Array  images 
were  analyzed  with  Feature  Extraction  software  (Agilent 
Technologies)  with 
for 
normalization. 
    For  NimbleGen  2.1M  CNV  array,  array  hybridization 
and  all  the  downstream  data  preprocessing  were  per-
formed  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  In 
brief,  2.5  ug  of  genomic  DNA  from  the  NA10851  cell  line 
was 
labeled  with  Cy3-labeled  NimbleGen  validated 
Random  9mer  (TriLink  BioThchknologies,  San  Diego, 
CA)  and  NA15510  was  labeled  with  Cy5-labeled  Nimble-
Gen  validated  Random  9mer  (TriLink  BioTechnologies) 
using  Klenow  Fragment  (NEB,  Ipswich,  MA).  Labeled 
reference  and  test  DNA  were  combined,  denatured  and 
pre-annealed  with  2X  Hybridization  Buffer 
(Roche 
NombleGen,  Madison,  WI).  The  mixed  DNA  was  hybri-
dized  onto  the  arrays  for  72  hours  in  a  MAUI  hybrid-
ization  machine  (BioMicro,  Utah)  at  42oC.  After  hybrid-
ization,  the  arrays  were  washed  and  scanned  with 
GenePix  4000B  scanner  (Molecular  Devices,  Sunnyvale, 
CA).  Array  images  were  analyzed  with  NimbleScan  v2.6

Defining  CNVs

the 

All  the  data  sets  from  the  three  different  platforms  were 
analyzed  using 
rank  segmentation  method  of 
NEXUS  software  (BioDiscovery)  under  the  same  thres-
hold.  NEXUS  is  the  algorithm  that  recursively  divides 
chromosomes  into  segments  of  common  intensity  dis-
tribution  functions  like  the  circular  binary  segmentation 
(CBS).

Result  and  Discussion

Based  on  the  rank  segmentation  algorithm,  we  defined 
the  CNVs  between  NA10851  and  NA15510  using  the 
three  different  array  platforms.  Details  of  the  identified 
CNVs  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Although  the  same 
DNA  was  analyzed  by  the  same  detection  algorithm,  the 
number  of  CNVs  varied  from  102  to  608  depending  on 
the  types  of  the  array  used.  The  smallest  number  of 
CNVs  were  identified  by  Affymetrix  SNP  5.0,  while 
Agilent  2X244K  and  NimbleGen  2.1M  arrays  defined  3 
to  6  times  more  CNVs.  Gain/loss  ratio  of  the  CNVs 
identified  by  Affymetrix  SNP  5.0,  Agilent  2X244K  and 
NimbleGen  2.1M  arrays  were  0.89  (48/54),  0.99  (188/189), 
and  3.57  (475/133),  respectively.  In  spite  of  the  large 
difference  in  the  number  of  identified  CNVs  among  the 
platforms,  the  total  CNV  coverage  of  the  genome  was 
all  similar  in  three  the  platforms,  ranging  from  6.7%  to 
9.9%  of  the  genome.  The  median  size  of  the  CNVs  was 
largest  for  Affymetrix  SNP  5.0  and  smallest  for  Agilent 
2X244K  array. 
    Of  the  102  CNVs  identified  by  Affymetrix  5.0,  76 
CNVs  (75%)  were  consistently  detected  by  the  other 
two  platforms.  Among  them,  71  (93%)  CNVs  overlap  the 
CNV  in  DGV.  Fig.  1A  illustrates  the  example  of  a  CNV 
identified  by  all  three  platforms.  This  35  kb  sized  copy 
number  gain  on  13q  is  located  within  the  previously  re-
ported  CNV  in  DGV  and  its  boundaries  were  almost 
same  boundaries  regardless  of  the  platforms.

CNVs  identified  by  NimbleGen  2.1M  array  were  not  de-

2.1M  arrays  but  not  by  Affymetrix  5.0  array.  This  9  kb 
sized  copy  number  loss  on  17p  also  overlaps  the  CNV 
in  DGV.  Its  boundaries  were  defined  almost  identically 
by  Agilent  2X244K  and  NimbleGen  2.1M  arrays.  This 
data  reflects  relatively  low  resolution  of  Affymetrix  5.0 
array,  which  makes  the  platform  less  efficient  for  detect-
ing  small  sized  CNVs.
    Due to the widespread availability, SNP array has been 
frequently  used  for  genome-wide  CNV  discovery  and 
CNV-disease association studies. Affymetrix Genome-wide 
SNP  5.0  is  one  of  the  commonly  used  SNP  array  plat-
forms  for  SNP-GWAS  as  well  as  CNV  analysis  in  Korea. 
In  our  analysis,  Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0  seems  to  de-
tect  CNVs  in  a  reliable  manner,  which  can  be  applied 
for  association  studies.  However,  for  the  purpose  of  de-
fining  CNVs  in  detail,  Affymetrix  Genome-wide  SNP  5.0 
might  be  relatively  less  ideal  than  NimbleGen  2.1M  CNV 
array  and  Agilent  2X244K  CNV  array,  which  outperform 
Affymetrix  array  for  defining  the  small-sized  single  copy 
variants.
