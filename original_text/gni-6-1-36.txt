Abstract

Radiotherapy  would  be  the  choice  of  treatment  for  hu-
man  cancers,  because  of  high  cost-effectiveness.  How-
ever,  a  certain  population  of  patients  shows  a  resistance 
to  radiotherapy  and  recurrence.  In  an  effort  to  increase 
the  efficacy  of  radiotherapy,  many  efforts  were  driven  to 
find  the  genes  causing  the  unresponsiveness  to  ionizing 
radiation.  In  this  paper,  we  compared  the  gene  ex-
pression  profiles  of  two  lung  cancer  cell  lines,  H460  and 
H1299,  which  showed  differential  responses  to  ionizing 
radiations.  Each  cell  were  irradiated  at  2  Gy,  and  har-
vested  after  0,  2,  4,  8,  12  and  24  hours  to  examine  the 
expressions.  Two-way  ANOVA  analysis  on  time-series 
experiments  of  two  cells  could  select  2863  genes  differ-
entially  expressed  upon  ionizing  radiation  among  32,321 
genes  in  microarray  (p＜0.05).  We  classified  these 
genes  into  21  clusters  by  SOM  clustering  according  to 
the  interaction  between  cell  types  and  time.  Two  SOM 
clusters  were  enriched  with  apoptosis-related  genes  in 
pathway  analysis.  One  cluster  contained  higher  levels  of 
phosphatidyl  inositol  3-phosphate  kinase  (PI3K)  subunits 
in  H1299,  radio-resistant  cells  than  H460,  radiosensitive 
cells.  TRAIL  receptors  were  expressed  in  H460  cells 
while  the  decoy  receptor  for  TRAIL  was  expressed  in 
H1299  cells.  From  these  results,  we  could  characterize 
the  differential  responsiveness  to  ionizing  radiation  ac-
cording  to  their  differential  expressions  of  apoptosis-re-
lated  genes,  which  might  be  the  candidates  to  increase 
the  power  of  radiotherapy.

Introduction

Radiotherapy  would  play  an  important  role  in  cancer 
treatment  for  long  times  and  widely  used  to  have  more 
than  one  million  patients  received  radiotherapy  every 
year  (Wu et al.,  2002).  In  some  type  of  cancers  at  pros-
tate  and  cervix,  radiotherapy  achieved  high  performance 
in  cure  rate  in  comparison  to  radical  surgery.  Moreover, 
it  can  be  applied  to  organ  conservation  surgery  in 
breast  cancers  and  rectal  cancers.  However,  a  certain 
proportion  of  patients  do  not  respond  to  radiotherapy, 
and  the  mechanism  of  radiation  resistance  has  been  the 
main  target  of  research  to  increase  the  efficacy  of 
radiotherapy. 
    Although  single  molecules  were  targeted  to  modulate 
the radiation responses at pre-clinical models, it was hard 
to be applied to patients. It might be due to the complex-
ity  of  radiation  responses  as  shown  in  gene  expression 
profiling  experiments  (Park et al.,  2002).  Recently  miRNA 
also has been proposed to be important regulator of radi-
ation  responses  (Weidhaas et al.,  2007).  Gene  expression 
profiling  using  microarray  provided  valuable  tools  for  the 
clinical  oncology  to  determine  the  prognosis  of  patients 
(Lossos et al.,  2004;  Pomeroy et al.,  2002),  the  molecular 
diagnosis  (Golub et al.,  1999)  as  well  as  the  responsive-
ness  to  therapeutics  (Snyder  and  Morgan,  2004).
    There  have  been  many  reports  on  the  molecular  pat-
tern  analysis  using  microarray  to  understand  the  chemo- 
and  radio-resistance  in  cervical  cancer  (Achary  et al., 
2000;  Tewari et al.,  2005;  Wong et al.,  2006),  rectal  can-
cer  (Kim et al.,  2007)  and  esophageal  cancer  (Fukuda et 
al.,  2004).  Most  of  the  studies  are  to  identify  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  in  patients  with  different  clin-
ical  outcomes,  which  can  be  applied  to  the  evaluation 
of  prognosis  more  accurately.  Although  the  conventional 
parameters  like  tumor  stage  and  grade  can  be  used  to 
decide  optimal  cancer  therapy,  molecular  markers  would 
provide  valuable  information  to  make  clinical  decisions 
(Klopp  and  Eifel,  2006).  Genome-wide  analysis  on  gene 
expression  can  predict  the  clinical  consequences  more 
accurately.  In  addition,  the  information  from  gene  ex-
pression  profiling  can  facilitate  the  development  of  bio-
logical  target  for  therapeutics  by  identifying  pathways 
and  determining  steps  contributing  to  the  phenotype. 
    In  this  study,  we  examined  the  expression  profiles  of 
two  lung  cancer  cell  lines,  which  showed  differential  re-

sponses  to  ionizing  radiation.  Especially  the  time-series 
data  of  two  cell  lines  revealed  radiation  response-related 
genes  from  constitutively  up-  or  down-regulated  genes 
in  two  cells.  Especially  we  focused  on  the  apoptosis 
pathway  in  different  clusters  of  radiation  response  to  ex-
plain  the  differential  responses  upon  ionizing  radiations. 

    After  the  exposure  to  ionizing  radiation  generated  by 
4MV  linear  accelerator  (Clinac  4/100,  Varian,  Palo  Alto, 
CA),  cells  were  harvested  at  the  indicated  time.  We  re-
peated  sets  of  experiment  three  times  to  collect  bio-
logical  triplicates  in  every  sample.   

Methods

Cell  culture  and  ionizing  radiation

H460  and  H1299  lung  cancer  cells  were  purchased  from 
ATCC  and  maintained  in  high-glucose  Dulbecco’s  Ea-
gle’s  medium  (DMEM;  GIBCO/BRL,  Gaithersburg,  Md., 
USA)  containing  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal  bovine  se-
rum  (FBS,  GIBCO/BRL)  and  50  U/ml  gamma-interferon 
(Gemzyme,  Cambridge,  MA,  USA). 

Microarray  and  data  analysis

Samples  in  each  group  were  harvested  in  triplicates  and 
total  RNAs  were  extracted  by  dissolving  in  TriZol  and 
the  purification  using  Qiagen  RNAeasy  column  (Park et 
al.,  2002).  We  used  GeneChip  Human  Gene  1.0  ST  ar-
ray  from  Affymetrix  which  includes  32,000  human  genes. 
Fluorescence  intensity  was  processed  and  measured 
using  Exon  Microarray  Analyzer.  Intensity  data  were  im-
ported  to  an  in-house  microarray  database  as  described 
previously  (Lee  et al.,  2006).

Results  and  Discussion

Differentially  expressed  genes  were  further  analyzed  us-
ing  DAVID  for  GO  analysis  as  well  as  pathway  analysis 
(Dennis  et al.,  2003). 

To  examine  the  molecular  changes  upon  ionizing  radia-
tion,  we  used  H460  and  H1299  lung  cancer  cells,  which 
show  different  responses  to  ionizing  radiation  in  the  clo-

microarray.  Because  two  lung  cancer  cells  originated 
from  two  different  individuals  with  different  genetic 
backgrounds,  there  should  be  lots  of  discrepancy  in 
transcription  profiles.  However,  if  we  can  compare  the 
time-series  expression  patterns  in  parallel,  it  would  be 
possible  to  detect  the  genes  related  to  differential  re-
sponses  to  ionizing  radiation.
    Differentially  expressed  genes  (DEGs)  were  selected  by 
two-way  ANOVA  on  two  time-series  data  (p＜0.05). 

Then  these  2863  DEGs  were  further  classified  into  21 
clusters  according  to  their  expression  patterns  using 
SOM  (Fig.  1).  Fourteen  out  of  21  clusters  containing 
more  than  10  genes  could  be  divided  into  two  groups 
like  RS  and  RR  (Table  1).  The  level  of  transcripts  in  RS 
clusters  are  higher  in  radio-sensitive  H460  cells  than  in 
H1299  cells,  while  RR  cluster  genes  are  expressed  at 
higher  levels  in  H1299  cells.  RS  group  contained  7  clus-
ters  with  1272  genes,  which  were  up-regulated  in  H460

cells.  When  we  examine  the  responses  in  H460  cells  in 
detail,  RS  group  could  be  classified  into  three  classes 
according  to  the  gene  expression  patterns  like  con-
stitutive  (RSC),  early  (RSE)  and  late  (RSL)  up-regulation 
by  ionizing  radiation.  RR  group  also  could  be  classified 
as  RRC,  RRE  and  RRL,  too. 
    We  have  characterized  each  clusters  according  to 
their  GO  terms  over-represented  in  each  cluster  sig-
nificantly  (p＜0.05).  As  listed  in  Table  2,  RS  clusters 

were  enriched  with  GO  terms  related  to  the  response  to 
radiation,  signal  transduction,  apoptosis  and  metabo-
lism.  For  RR  clusters,  we  could  find  the  GO  terms  re-
lated  to  cell  cycle,  DNA  damage  and  apoptosis  (Table 
3).  Using  DAVID  web-accessible  program,  we  examined 
the  KEGG  pathways  related  to  each  cluster  to  under-
stand  the  time-series  data  on  the  cellular  responses  to 
ionizing  radiation  (Table  4).  As  GO  analysis  showed  the 
enrichment  of  terms  on  biological  process,  apoptosis

pathways  were  significantly  changed  in  both  of  RS 
(RSC)  and  RR  (RRE)  clusters.  In  addition,  metabolic  and 
signaling  pathways  were  selected  in  RS  group,  and  cell 
cycle  pathway  in  RR  group.
    RSC  cluster  contained  26  apoptosis-related  genes 
(Table  2),  which  were  over-expressed  in  H460  cells,  but 
not  changed  upon  ionizing  radiation.  Caspases  (CASP8 
and  CASP10),  interleukins  (IL1A,  IL1B  and  IL6),  TRAIL 
receptors  (TNFRSF10A  and  TNFRSF10B)  might  play  an 
important  role  in  cell  death  upon  ionizing  radiation  in 
H460  cells  (Table  5).  These  genes  were  present  in  lower 
levels,  and  not  induced  by  irradiation  in  H1299.  RRL 
cluster  contained  the  genes  which  were  up-regulated  in 
H1299  cells,  and  induced  in  H460  cells  after  8  hours  of 
irradiation.  Among  6  genes,  Survivin 
(BIRC5)  and 
GADD45A  might  be  related  to  radio-resistance  of  H1299 
cells.  RRE  clusters  in  RR  group  contained  7  apopto-
sis-related  genes  like  PI3K  subunits  (PIK3CA,  PIK3CB 
and  PIK3R4)  and  IRAK4.  Many  genes  related  to  apopto-
sis  were  selected  in  two-way  ANOVA  analysis,  and  their 
differential  activity  to  determine  the  radiation  responses 
could  be  sorted  out  by  SOM  and  pathway  analysis. 
    Radiation  sensitivity  is  usually  determined  by  classical 
clonogenic  assay  in  radiation  biology.  But  it  is  not  easy 
to  establish  cell  line  from  the  individual  patient's  speci-
men  and  too  slow  to  be  used  as  a  routine  work.  As  a 
result,  there  is  no  available  clinical  method  to  predict  ra-
diation  response  to  radiation  therapy.  If  we  can  predict 
individual  response  rate  to  radiation  therapy,  we  can 
modify  total  dose  and  fractionation  schedule  of  radiation 
therapy  individually  so  as  to  increase  therapeutic  ratio.
    We  have  examined  the  gene  expression  profiles  to 
understand  the  underlying  molecular  changes  in  cells 
with  different  radiation  sensitivity.  From  the  differentially 
expressed  genes,  we  can  select  the  biomarkers  to  dis-
criminate  the  radio-resistant  tumors  from  radio-sensitive 
one.  Using  those  genomic  biomarkers,  we  can  develop 
the  platform  to  check  the  radiation  response  in  radio-
therapy  patients.  Further  study  is  undergoing  with  pa-
tient's  tumor  specimen.
