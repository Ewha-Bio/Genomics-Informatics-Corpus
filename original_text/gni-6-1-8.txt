Abstract

High-density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  whose  primary  role  is  to 
transport  cholesterol  from  peripheral  tissues  to  the  liver, 
is  associated  with  the  incidence  of  coronary  heart  di-
sease.  We  analyzed  HDL  cholesterol  levels  in  a  genet-
ically  isolated  population  of  extended  Mongolian  fami-
lies.  A  total  of  1002  individuals  (54.5%  women)  from  95 
families  were  enrolled.  After  genotyping  by  use  of  1000 
microsatellite  markers,  we  performed  a  genome-wide 
linkage  search  with  variance  component  analysis.  The 
estimated  heritability  of  HDL  cholesterol  was  0.45,  re-
vealing  that  HDL  cholesterol  was  under  significant  ge-
netic  influence.  We  found  peak  evidence  of  linkage  (LOD 
score=1.88)  for  HDL  cholesterol  level  on  chromosome  6 
(nearest  marker  D6S1660)  and  potential  evidences  for 
linkage  on  chromosomes  1,  12  and  19  with  the  LOD 
scores  of  1.32,  1.44  and  1.14,  respectively.  These  re-
sults  should  pave  the  way  for  the  discovery  of  the  rele-
vant  genes  by  fine  mapping  and  association  analysis.

Introduction

Cholesterol  is  a  major  part  of  cell  membranes.  Chole-
sterol  is  carried  in  the  blood  by  chylomicrons,  very  low 
density  lipoproteins  (VLDL),  high  density  lipoproteins 
(HDL)  and  low  density  lipoproteins  (LDL)  (Dastani et al. 
2006).  HDL  cholesterol  is  reversely  associated  with  car-

diovascular  disease,  and  is  more  tightly  controlled  by 
genetic  factors  than  the  other  lipoproteins  such  as  LDL, 
VLDL  and  chylomicrons.  Environmental  factors  including 
chronic  alcoholism,  estrogen  replacement  therapy,  and 
exercise  influence  the  levels  of  HDL  cholesterol.  Several 
families  with  strikingly  elevated  HDL  cholesterol  levels 
have  been  identified.  HDL  cholesterol  levels  are  higher 
in  blacks  compared  with  whites  and  HDL  cholesterol 
levels  of  females  are  higher  than  those  of  males  (Barcat 
et al.  2006;  Brousseau  et al.  2004;  Yamashita  et al. 
2000;  Imperatore  et al.  2000). 
    Candidate  gene  analysis  using  population-based 
case-control  studies  has  been  used  to  test  the  associa-
tion  between  SNPs  and  HDL  cholesterol  levels.  Among 
the  candidate  genes  selected  mainly  from  lipid  metabo-
lism  pathways, ApoA-I  gene  is  the  one  most  intensively 
studied  (Inazu et al.  1994;  Kuivenhoven et al.  1997).  By 
genome-wide  linkage  analysis,  susceptibility  genes  can 
be  identified  although  the  genes  are  not  candidates 
based  on  lipid  metabolism.  Genome-wide  linkage  scans 
are  conducted  by  use  of  microsatellite  markers  to  iden-
tify  genetic  determinants  affecting  the  traits  (Wang  and 
Paigen  2005).  Using  HDL  cholesterol  levels  as  either 
discrete  or  quantitative  trait,  several  linkage  studies  on 
genetic  determinants  of  HDL  cholesterol  have  been  re-
ported  (Yancey et al.  2003).  Genetic  effects  on  the  var-
iations  in  HDL  cholesterol  were  studied  mainly  in 
Caucasians  and  Africans  thus  far,  and  little  attention  has 
been  focused  in  this  regard  on  Asian  populations.  We 
found  suggestive  evidence  for  linkage  for  HDL  choles-
terol  on  chromosome  6,  1,  12  and  19,  in  studies  con-
ducted  as  part  of  GENDISCAN  study,  a  large  epidemio-
logical  study  of  Complex  traits  in  geographically,  cultur-
ally  and  genetically  isolated  large  Mongolian  families  l  in 
Dornod,  Mongolia  report. 

Methods

Subjects,  medical  histories,  genotyping,  and 
measurement  of  HDL  cholesterol

We  analyzed  data  from  1002  Mongolian  individuals  from 
95  large  extended  families.  Informed  consent  was  ob-
tained  from  all  subjects  prior  to  participation  and  the 
protocol  was  approved  by  the  Institutional  Review 
Board  at  Seoul  National  University.  Potentially  con-
founding  variables  were  assessed  for  each  participant 
along  with  overall  medical  history.  Information  on  age, 

gender  and  anthropometry  (height,  weight,  waist  circum-
ference,  hip  circumference  and  body  fat  content)  were 
obtained  for  each  individual.  Height  in  centimeter  (cm) 
and  weight  in  kilograms  (kg)  were  measured  using  an 
automatic  measuring  instrument  (IMI  1000,  Immanuel 
Elec.,  Korea).  Body  mass  index  (BMI)  was  calculated  in 
kg/m2.  Waist  circumference  was  measured  to  the  near-
est  centimeter  at  the  level  of  the  umbilicus,  and  hip  cir-
cumference  was  measured  at  the  level  of  the  maximal 
circumference  of  the  gluteus.  All  other  variables  were 
collected 
trained 
interviewers.  Information  about  amount  of  alcohol  and 
smoking  was  also  obtained  from  all  the  participants. 
    All  the  subjects  were  asked  to  fast  for  12  hours  before 

interviews  performed  by

their  visit.  Blood  samples  were  collected  from  an  ante-
cubital  vein  into  vacutainer  tubes  containing  EDTA. 
Blood  samples  were  centrifuged  at  3000rpm  for  10  mi-

nutes  and  then  stored  at  −70oC.  DNA  was  isolated 

from  lymphocytes  for  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR) 
and  automated  genotyping.  A  10  ml  blood  sample  was 
collected  from  each  participating  individual  for  genomic 
DNA  extraction.  DNA  was  extracted  from  peripheral  lym-
phocytes  using  the  PUREGENE  DNA  Purification  Kit  for 
whole  blood  (Gentra  Systems  Inc,  USA).  For  genotyping, 
a  set  of  1000  microsatellite  markers  deCODE  mapping 
sets  (deCODE  genetics,  USA)  was  used  covering  the 
genome  at  an  average  density  of  3  centimorgans  (cM). 
    HDL  cholesterol  was  measured  by  the  enzymatic 
method  using  Cholestest-N-HDL  kit  (DAICHI,  JAPAN) 
and  HITACHI  7600-210  &  HITACHI  7180  instruments. 
Extensive  quality  control  procedures  ensured  the  validity 
and  reproducibility  of  the  measurements.

fect  of  confounding  variables.  Pedigree  data  was  man-
aged  by  PedSys  (Southwest  Foundation  for  Biomedical 
Research,  San  Antonio,  Texas,  USA).  Nonpaternity  was 
examined  using  PEDCHECK  (Mcpeek  and  Sun  2000) 
and  relationships  other  than  paternity  were  checked  us-
ing  average  IBD-based  method  by  PREST.  After  correct-
ing  pedigree  error  and  Mendelian  errors,  non-mendelian 
errors  were  examined  and  corrected  using  SimWalk. 
Identity  by  descent  (IBD)  matrix  between  every  relation-
ship  pairs  in  family  was  calculated  and  IBD  matrix  for 
single  marker  was  calculated  by  SOLAR  (Sequential 
Oligogenic  Linkage  Analysis  Routines  software  version 
2.1.4).  Multipoint  IBD  matrices  were  computed  on  every 

1  cM  distance  using  Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  method 
by  LOKI  (Heath  1997). 
    Genetic  components  of  selected  phenotypes  were  es-
timated  in  terms  of  heritability.  Narrow  sense  heritability, 
defined  as  the  proportion  of  total  phenotypic  variation 
due  to  additive  genetic  effects,  was  calculated.  Herita-
bility  of  HDL  cholesterol  adjusted  for  age,  gender,  age- 
square,  product  of  age  and  gender,  product  of  age- 
square  and  gender,  systolic  BP,  smoking  and  alcohol 
was  estimated  and  a  variance  component  linkage  analy-
sis  was  carried  out  by  SOLAR  which  uses  maximum 
likelihood  methods  to  estimate  variance  components  for 
the  polygenic  genetic  effect  and  random  individual  envi-
ronmental  effects.

Results  and  Discussion

The  mean  age  of  the  1002  individuals  was  31  years  and 
54.5%  of  them  were  female.  Demographic  and  pedigree 
characteristics  of  the  study  sample  are  shown  in  Table 
1.  The  family  size  had  a  mean  of  16.  Table  2  included 
information  on  2546  pairs  of  first  degree  relatives  (1812 
parent-offspring  pairs  and  734  full-sib  pairs),  2485  pairs 
of  their  second  degree  relatives  (395  half-sibling  pairs, 
1202  grandparent-grandchild  pairs,  and  888  avuncular 
pairs),  and  598  first-cousin  pairs.  Means  of  their  total 
cholesterol,  HDL  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol,  and  trigly-
ceride  were  159.82  mg/dl,  55.19  mg/dl,  90.51  mg/dl,

between  HDL  cholesterol  and  covariates  such  as  age, 
gender,  systolic  blood  pressure,  alcohol  consumption 
status,  and  smoking  status.  These  parameters  were 
used  as  covariates  in  the  variance  component  analysis 
which  provided  multivariable  adjusted  heritability  esti-
mates  for  HDL  cholesterol  of  0.45  (Table  4).  The  peak 
multipoint  LOD  score  was  1.88  on  6p21  (nearest  marker 
D6S1660)  and  a  secondary  peak  (LOD  score  of  1.44) 
was  found  on  12q23  (nearest  marker  D12S354).  We 
identified  other  potential  evidence  for  linkage  in  the  LOD 
score  of  1.32  on  1q24  (nearest  marker  D1S412)  and  a 
LOD  score  of  1.14  at  19p13  (nearest  marker  D19S884) 
(Fig.  1,  2).  Table  5  presents  all  LOD  scores  ＞1.0  for 
HDL  cholesterol. 
    We  identified  potential  evidence  of  linkage  on  several 
chromosomes.  In  other  genome  scan,  a  weak  linkage 
signal  for  HDL  cholesterol  was  observed  for  regions  that 
overlapped  slightly  with  the  regions  identified  herein.

the  chromosome  12q  in  European  American  population 
(Klos et al.  2001)  (Table  6).  We  found  evidence  of  link-

towards 

(TRAFs),  and 

age  at  similar  region  in  the  chromosome  12q23.  This  lo-
cus  is  reported  to  be  associated  with  variation  in  plas-
ma  apoA-I  level.  Given  the  fact  that  the  subjects  of  oth-
er  studies  were  primarily  of  European  and  African  ori-
gins,  whereas  those  in  the  present  study  were  of  Asian 
origin,  the  loci  on  the  chromosome  1,  6,  and  19  appear 
to  be  potential  susceptibility  loci  for  the  variation  of  HDL 
cholesterol  in  our  Asian  ethnic  group,  with  likely  smaller 
effects  for  European  and  African  American  compared 
with  Asian  (Peacock  et al.  2001;  Almasy  et al.  1999). 
    Several  candidate  genes  influencing  HDL  cholesterol 
variation,  reside  at  chromosome  1q24  region.  Microso-
mal  glutathione  S-transferase  3  catalyzes  glutathione- 
dependent  peroxidase  activity 
lipid  hydro-
peroxides  (Mari  and  Cederbaum  2001).  HDL  cholesterol 
may  be  more  rapidly  oxidized  than  LDL  in  vivo.  HDL  is 
the  principal  vehicle  for  circulating  plasma  lipid  hydro-
peroxides  (Bowry,  Stanley,  and  Stocker  1992).  A  specific 
gene  called  SRY  (sex  determining  region  Y)-box  4  is  lo-
cated  at  chromosome  6p21  region.  This  gene  encodes 
a  member  of  the  SOX  (SRY-related  HMG-box)  family  of 
transcription  factors.  It  plays  a  major  role  in  the  regu-
lation  of  embryonic  development  and  may  function  in 
tumorigenesis  as  well.  (Forwood,  Harley,  and  Jans 
2001).  TRAF  and  TNF  receptor-associated  protein  en-
coded  by TTRAP  associates  with  CD40,  tumor  necrosis 
factor  (TNF)  receptor-75  and  TNF  receptor  associated 
factors 
factor-kappa-B 
activation. 
    We  have  found  four  loci  for  HDL  cholesterol,  covering 
a  large  portion  of  the  genome.  The  genomic  regions 
identified  in  this  study  need  further  studies  involvinf  fine 
mapping  of  these  regions.  The  region  is  very  large,  en-
compassing  more  than  3  cM  of  genetic  length  and  con-
taining  between  3-5  megabases  of  DNA,  with  several 
genes.  After  genotyping  at  less  than  1  cM  intervals  us-
ing  SNP  chip  and  fidentifying  the  polymorphisms  that 
are  likely  to  have  functional  significance  for  HDL  choles-
terol  variation,  we  can  confirm  the  polymorphisms  by 
association  study. 
    Several  other  genetic  studies  attempted  to  identify  the 
genes  contributing  to  HDL  cholesterol  variation.  These 
studies  focused  on  families  with  extreme  HDL  cholester-
ol  levels  (Shoulders,  Jones,  and  Naoumova  2004;  Aoui-
zerat et al.  1999).  Our  study  as  did  some  others,  exam-
ined  families  with  members  having  serum  HDL  choles-
terol  within  the  normal  range  (Mahaney  et al.  2003; 
Pajukanta et al.  2003;  Arya et al.  2002).  When  homoge-
nous  populations  are  studied,  environmental  variations 
might  be  lower  and  the  genetic  makeup  of  these  pop-
ulations  less  complex  (Coon  et al.  2001).  GENDISCAN 
study  is  the  first  and  largest  family  study  of  Asian 
populations.  The  uniqueness  of  this  study  is  that  study 

inhibit  nuclear 

subjects  are  members  of  large  extended  families  in  an 
isolated  rural  area,  long  exposed  to  similar  environ-
mental  conditions.  The  component  of  the  GENDISCAN 
study,  we  describe  here,  provides  statistical  support  for 
linkage  of  the  level  of  HDL  cholesterol.  It  should  provide 
the  basis  for  identification  of  genetic  polymorphism  re-
lated  with  lipid  metabolism  in  Asian  population.
