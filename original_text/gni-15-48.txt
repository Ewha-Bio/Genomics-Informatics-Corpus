Tumor  tissues  from  biopsies  or  surgery  are  major  sources  for  the  next  generation  sequencing  (NGS)  study,  but  these 
procedures are invasive and have limitation to overcome intratumor heterogeneity. Recent studies have shown that driver 
alterations in tumor tissues can be detected by liquid biopsy which is a less invasive technique capable of both capturing the 
tumor  heterogeneity  and  overcoming  the  difficulty  in  tissue  sampling.  However,  it  is  still  unclear  whether  the  driver 
alterations in liquid biopsy can be detected by targeted NGS and how those related to the tissue biopsy. In this study, we 
performed whole-exome sequencing for a breast cancer tissue and identified PTEN p.H259fs*7 frameshift mutation. In the 
plasma  DNA  (liquid  biopsy)  analysis  by  targeted  NGS,  the  same  variant  initially  identified  in  the  tumor  tissue  was  also 
detected with low variant allele frequency. This mutation was subsequently validated by digital polymerase chain reaction in 
liquid biopsy. Our result confirm that driver alterations identified in the tumor tissue were detected in liquid biopsy by 
targeted NGS as well, and suggest that a higher depth of sequencing coverage is needed for detection of genomic alterations 
in a liquid biopsy.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has not 
only  revolutionized  cancer  research  but  also  is  currently 
being used to guide clinicians’ decision-making for cancer 
treatments.  Although  tumor  tissues  from  biopsies  or 
surgery  are  major  sources  for  the  NGS  study  of  primary, 
metastatic and resistant tumors, these serial tumor biopsies 
are often invasive procedures limited to certain locations and 
not easily acceptable in the clinic. More importantly, tissue 
biopsy has a severe limitation in view of the pronounced 
genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the tumor tissues 
[1].  To  overcome  the  limitations  of  tissue  biopsies  or 

surgery, a less invasive technique capable of both capturing 
the tumor heterogeneity and overcoming the difficulty in 
tissue  sampling  during  the  course  of  therapy  is  needed. 
Circulating  tumor  DNA  (ctDNA)  is  comprised  of  small 
fragments of DNA released from cells undergoing apoptosis 
or necrosis in tumor tissues [2]. Recent studies have shown 
that driver alterations in tumor tissues can be detected by 
liquid biopsy for ctDNA [3]. However, it is still uncertain 
whether the driver alterations in ctDNA can be detected by 
targeted NGS and how those related to the tissue biopsy.

department for evaluation of her right shoulder pain. She 
was previously diagnosed as a breast cancer 6 years ago. The 
patient was treated with quadrantectomy along with axillary 
node  dissection  (invasive  ductal  carcinoma,  pT2N0M0, 
estrogen  receptor  [ER]  positive,  progesterone  receptor 
positive  and  human  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  2 
[HER2] negative), adjuvant radiation of the left breast, and 
adjuvant toremifen (an oral selective ER modulator) for 5 
years.  Seven  months  after  the  termination  of  adjuvant 
toremifen, the patient a pathologic fracture of right distal 
clavicle, multiple bone, lung and liver metastases (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). During 3 years of the systemic treatment, 

the patient had progression of chest, liver and bone meta-
stases (Supplementary Fig. 2). 

To identify the genetic alterations in the tumor tissue, we 
performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) for the cancer 
tissue metastasized to femur along with her matched normal 
DNA form peripheral blood. Generation and processing of 
the sequencing data were performed as previously described 
[4]. In the WES, a total of 53 nonsilent somatic mutations 
and 23 copy number alterations (CNAs) were detected (Sup-
plementary Tables 1 and 2). Among them, PTEN p.H259fs*7 
frameshift  mutation  (Fig.  1A)  as  well  as  FGFR1,  c-MYC, 
CDK4, and MDM2 amplifications (Fig. 1E) were identified as

driver alterations in this tumor.

To  validate  these,  the  metastatic  tumor  and  matched 
normal samples of the patient were re-analyzed by a targeted 
NGS. Targeted NGS was performed using the OncoChase 
Cancer Panel v0.9 (ConnectaGen, Seoul, Korea) consisting 
of 78 well-characterized cancer genes (Supplementary Table 
3)  with  Ion  PGM  Dx  system  (Thermo  Fisher  Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). Coverage of depth was 416× for the 
metastatic tumor sample and 754× for the normal sample. 
In the OncoChase analysis, all five driver alterations pre-
viously  identified  in  the  WES  were  consistently  detected 
(Fig. 1B and 1E). Of note, variant allele frequency (VAF) of 
PTEN frameshift mutation detected by WES (68.8%) were 
almost  similar  to  that  detected  by  OncoChase  (63.2%), 
suggesting the OncoChase Cancer Panel may be reliable for 
the detection of driver alterations. 

Next, we analyzed the plasma DNA (liquid biopsy) of the 
patient  using  the  same  cancer  panel  (OncoChase  Cancer 
Panel v0.9). Coverage of depth was 1,213× for the liquid 
biopsy  sample.  The  PTEN  frameshift  mutation  initially 
identified in the tumor tissue was also detected in her liquid 
biopsy with a VAF of 11.2% (Fig. 1C). This mutation was 
subsequently validated by digital polymerase chain reaction 
(Fig.  1D).  The  ctDNA  also  harbored  c-MYC,  CDK4  and 
MDM2 amplification but signal intensities of the CNAs were 
relatively lower than those of the tissue biopsy (Fig. 1E). One 
CNA (FGFR amplification) identified in the tumor tissue was 
not detected in the ctDNA. 

Comprehensive  review  of  the  hormone  status  (ER 
positive) and genetic alteration (CDK4 amplification) status 
strongly suggested the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors such as 
palbociclib  [5]  combined  with  aromatase  inhibitor  [6]. 
However, due to her dismal hepatic function, palbociclib was 
not administered, and she passed away after 52 months of 
cancer recurrence. In this study, we showed an example that 
driver  alterations  identified  in  the  tumor  tissue  were 

detected in liquid biopsy by targeted NGS as well. The low 
VAF of mutation and attenuated CNA signals in the liquid 
biopsy compared to the tissue biopsy suggest that a higher 
depth of sequencing coverage is required for detection of 
genomic alterations in a liquid biopsy than in a tissue biopsy.
