Abstract 
An approach for genome analysis based on assembly of 
fragments  of  DNA  from  the  whole  genome  can  be 
applied  to  obtain  the  complete  nucleotide  sequence  of 
the  genome  of  Zymomonas  mobilis.  However,  the 
problem of fragment assembly raise thorny computational 
issues.  Computer  simulation  studies  of  sequence 
assembly usually show some abnormal  assemblage of 
artificial  sequences  containing  repetitive  or  duplicated 
regions,  and  suggest  methods 
those 
abnormalities.  In this paper, we describe five simulation 
studies which had been performed previous to the actual 
genome assembly process of Zymomonas mobilis ZM4.

Introduction 
Since the random shotgun method1) was first applied to 
the whole  genome sequencing  project of Haemophilus 
influenzae  in  1995  {Fleischmann  et  a/.,  1995),  the 
shotgun  sequencing  approach  has  become  the  most 
prevailing method of determining the sequence of a long

1)  The  process  of  shotgun  sequencing  begins  by  physically 
breaking the DNA into random fragments, which are then read 
by a sequencing machine.  Next,  a computer program  pieces 
together the many overlapping reads and reconstructs theorigina 
sequence. 

DNA fragment.  The  identification  of the whole genome 
sequence of Zymomonas mobilis ZM42)  has  also been 
completed through shotgun method (Sea eta/., 2005, in 
press). The basic random shotgun protocol is as follows: 

1)  Biologists  randomly  fracture  the  sample  either 

using sonication or nebulation. 

2)  To  remove  fragments  that are  too  large  or small, 

this pool of fragments is then size-selected. 

3)  Biologists then  insert the  size-selected  fragments 

into the vector, to produce bacterial colonies. 

4)  The sequencing information is processed,  reading 

both end-sequences of each clone. 

5)  Given  the  collection  of  reads  obtained  from  a 
shotgun  protocol,  bioinformaticians  perform  the 
computational process,  called fragment assembly, 
to infer the source sequence. 

We can think offragment assembly as a jigsaw puzzle3l. 
Knowing the approximate length of the target sequence, 
it  is  possible  to  sequence  the  whole  molecule  directly. 
However,  we  may  instead  get a piece  of the  molecule 
starting  at  a  random  position  and  sequence  it  in  the 
canonical  direction.  A  fragment  corresponds  to  a 
substring of one of the strands of the target molecule, but 
which position in the whole genome would not be known. 
By using the random shotgun method, we try to reconstruct 
the  target  molecule's  sequence  based  on  fragment 
overlap. Fragment assembly is then to deduce the whole 
sequence  of  the  target  DNA  molecule.  However,  this 
seemingly simple process is not without technical challenges.

2)  Zymomonas  mobilis  is  an  obligatorily  fermentative  Gram(cid:173)
negative bacterium that utilizes sucrose, glucose, and fructose 
leading to the production of ethanol and C02. Because Zmobili 
is  an  interesting  microorganism  for  its  powerful  activity  of 
ethanol  fermentation,  this  bacterium  has  been  studied  using 
molecular  genetic  and  biochemical  method  for  last  decades 
(Kang eta!., 1998). The full sequence of Zmobi/isis registered 
in NCBI (AE008692). 

3)  Usually,  sequencing  machines  are  able  to  handle  only 
500-1000 base fragments at a time (a read).  These fragments 
must  be  assembled 
into  a  single  continuous  genomic 
sequence.  There  are  two  broad  approaches to  this  problem: 
Using an ordered set of markers along a sequence,  or using 
many overlapping sequences (high coverage) to infer ordering 
directly from the sequences themselves.

ends, yielding mated sequence reads 

Zymomonas mobilis existed many difficult problems. For 
example, the data usually contains errors, from limitations 
in  sequencing  technologies  or  from  human  mistakes 
during 
laboratory  work.  Even  without  experimental 
errors, fragment assembly have features that complicate 
the  assembly  process  in  a  computational  sense,  most 
notably,  repeats or chimeras.  And  these problems tend 
to make spurious contigs4 l. Various algorithms and concepts 
have been borrowed from computing technology to solve 
this fragment assembly problem. For example, in step 5, 
we  usually  use  overlap-layout- consensus5)  strategy 
(Chen  et  a/.,  2000),  the  most  popular  approach  to 
fragment  assembly.  However,  this  method  still  makes 
erroneous assembly because the overlap-layout-consensus 
strategy has some flaws in handling repetitive or duplicated 
regions. To overcome these weaknesses, bioinformaticians 
use mate-pair information6) (see Fig.  1 ). 

Although hundreds of microbial genomes and several 
eukaryotic genomes have been sequenced completely, 
whole-genome sequencing is still one of the major challenges 
in bioinformatics. Thus, both public and industrial sectors 
try to improve the assembling process of whole-genome. 
In  this  paper,  we  describe  five  computer  simulation 
studies of artificial sequences, which had been performed 
previously to the actual assembly process of Zymomonas 
mobilis ZM4, and which greatly helped us to improve our 
assembly skills in handling real sequencing data. 

Methods 
Systems 
All  our simulations were  performed  on  a  linux-box with 
two Intel Pentiumiii-500MHz CPUs and 2-GByte memory. 

4)  Contig: A contiguous region of DNA sequence assembled from 

overlapping reads of random cloned fragments 

5)  Overlap  Phase:  Every read  is  compared  to  every other  read. 
Layout Phase: Relative position of the reads is determined, and 
spanning  forest  of  overlaps  is  used  to  produce  a  layout. 
Consensus  Phase:  Multi-alignment of reads  in  regions  where 
coverage is greater than 3. 

6)  Mate Pair: DNA sequence reads from opposite ends of a single 
cloned  piece  of  DNA  (see  Fig.  1).  It  could  come  from  small 
insert  clone  (2  kbp),  medium  insert  clone  (10  kbp),  or  BAG 
clone.  It is used for computational gap closure

For simulations, we initially used phrap (Green, 1999) as 
a fragment assembly tool.  However, we had to develop 
several analysis softwares additionally, which are written 
in  Python,  Peri and C++. 

Studies on some repeat patterns 
We  started  simulations  with 
randomly  generated 
1 OOkb-long artificial sequence. Then we added 4 different 
repeat  patterns  to  the  original  sequence  to  analyze 
various results of assembly, corresponding to each repeat 
pattern. Characteristics of the five 1 OOkb-long sequences 
are described in the Table 1.  Repeats could be sorted in 
two groups. One is tandem repeats with short repeat unit 
and the other is duplication of identical sequences. 

In  all  simulations,  both  2k  fragments  and  10k 
fragments were generated. The number of 2k fragments 
is  800  and the number of 1 Ok fragments is 200,  so that 
total  number  of fragments  is  1 ,000.  Each  fragment  is 
composed  of  two  reads:  front  and  rear.  So  the  total 
number  of  reads  is  2,000.  We  assumed  that  the 
read-length is 500nt. Therefore, sequencing coverage in 
each  simulation  is  10x fold.  After every  simulation,  we 
checked  the  accuracy  of  assembly  result  with  the 
phrapview of the ph rap package and bl2seq of NCBI.

number of 2,000 reads were generated and assembled. 
Assembling the sequences resulted in only one contig of 
length  99,953nt.  For the sake of simplicity,  we assume 
that  short  tandem  repeats  are  not  included  in  the 
alignments.  In  Fig.  2,  the phrapview7) shows that all the 
the  contig  are  arranged

appropriately.  We  also  checked 
the  accuracy  by 
comparing the assembled contig with the original source 
sequence using bl2seq8) (Fig. 9-a).

this  simulation, 
fragments were assembled into 7 contigs (Fig. 3). Among 
them, only two contigs could be assembled only with the 
right mate pairs,  however, the rest of them consisted of 
'taaat',  'aaatt',  'attaa',  'aatta',  or  'ttaaa',  respectively. 
Now,  we  have  to  make  sure  whether  the  two  longer 
contigs could  be  ordered  by mate-pair information.  For 
this,  we  referenced  '.phrap.out'  file,  one  of the  phrap 
result  files.  This  file  contains  mate-pair  information  of 
inter or intra contigs. As in table 2,  mate-pair information 
indicates that the reverse-complemented Contig7 comes 
after the Contig6,  and this ordering  is confirmed  by the 
pair-wise alignment results (See Fig.  9-b and  Fig.  9-c). 
Table 2 also shows that the size of the gap between two 
longer  contigs

information is useful for additional gap-closing process. 

is  about  1.1 k,  and

Simulation  No.  3:  In  this  simulation,  the  original 
sequence was separated into 3 regions by the two repetitive 
regions.  So,  the phrap made 6 short contigs and 4  long 
contigs out of collection  of reads (See Fig.  4).  Six short 
contigs are almost same with each other, that is, they are 
filled  with  repetitive  patterns.  Repetitve  pattern  is  also 
shown in both the rear regions of Contig9 and one end of 
the Contig8 and Contig10 (See Fig. 5). Although the rear 
regions of contigs are not clearly assembled,  1 Ok-mate 
information  gives  us  appropriate  ordering  information. 

7)  Phrapview is a graphical tool that provides a "global" view of the 

phrap assembly. 

8)  Bl2seq  performs a comparison  between two sequences using 
either the blastn or blastp algorithm.  Both sequences must be 
either nucleotides or proteins.

regions of Contig9 and one end of the Contig8 and Contig10.

Simulation No. 4: Contrary to the simulation number 2 
and  number  3,  this  simulation  contains  four  identical 
sequences which is randomly generated (Table 1 ).  After 
running  phrap,  we obtained  five contigs.  All  the contigs 
have  feasible  mate-pair  information  (Fig.  6).  By  using 
mate-pair information,  we  could  finally  arrange the five 
contigs  in  appropriate  order  (Fig.  10-b).  In  fact,  2k 
mate-pair information in blue circle in Fig.  6 is not evenly 
spread.  However,  10k  mate  information  covers  the 
region with evenly overlapped mate-pairs information. 

Simulation No. 5:  In the previous simulation, it seems 
not to be problematic to  assemble sequence which  has 
relatively  short identical  sequences  (in  this  case,  1 kb ). 
However,  many  biological  sequences  contain  a  few 
identical regions longer than 1 kb.  So, the fifth simulation 
used  more realistic sequence close to the original  data 
(Table  1 ).  In  this  simulation,  the  ph rap  assembled  the 
reads into 5 contigs. All the five contigs,  except Contig1, 
seemed to be well  assembled  because of their feasible 
mate-pair information  (See  Fig.  8).  Table  3 shows that 
several  1 Ok-mate  pair  information,  Contig4-Contig5, 
Contig5-Contig2 and  Contig2-Contig3 were adjacent to 
each other. However, the estimated gap-sizes are all 5k, 
although each mate-pair information linking Contig4-Contig5, 
Contig5-Contig2 and Contig2-Contig3 is  1 Ok-mate.  This 
means  that  each  gap  should  contain  one  of  three 
identical 5k sequences so that the gap-size could be 1 Ok. 
Therefore,  these  contigs could  be ordered  as shown  in 
Fig.  10-c.

the left side of the figure, 2k-mate information is not feasible,  but

classify all the repeat patterns in a genomics sequence. 
One of the difficulties in repeat classification is that many 
repeats represent mosaics of sub-repeats (Bailey et at., 
2002).  Different  combinations  of  sub-repeats  form 
different repeat copies (Baa et at.,  2002). 

Although this problem looks easy to solve for the toy 
examples as  in  the five  simulations,  inconsistencies  in 
local  alignments  make  it  extremely  difficult  for  real 
genomics sequences.  Through the five simulations,  we 
studied  how  we  could  apply  mate-pair  information  to 
ordering  contigs in  real  data.  Now,  we will  describe the 
process of assembling Zymomonas mobilis by applying 
the methods we used in the simulations. 

Initial assembly result 
The  best  known  programs  for  repeat  annotation  are 
RepeatMasker  module  in  Phrad  package,  which  use 
precompiled  repeat  libraries  to  find  copies  of  known 
repeat families  represented  in  RepBase.  However,  the 
repeat  libraries  have  to  be  manually  compiled  for  any 
new genome like Zymomonas mobilis, because they are 
genome-specific.  Thus,  the  only  possible  approach  to 
repeat analysis of a newly sequenced genome would be 
to simply list all pairs of repeated regions. 

At first,  tens of thousands of read  data were picked. 
After filtering out wrongly sized mate-pair and chimera9), 
approximately 42,000 reads were selected and assembled 
into 436 contigs (Fig.  11 ). The edges represent mate pairs. 
Contigs are assembled after filtering out all  the possible 
repeats, using both the existing RepeatMasker and domestically 
developed software tools, written in  Perllanguage.

molecules created by joining DNA fragments from two or more 
different organisms.

starts 
finding  pairwise  similarities  and  use 
clustering to group similar sequences together. However, 
clustering  based  on  sequence  similarities  presents  a 
serious problem because local sequence alignments do 
not typically correspond to the biological boundaries of a 
repeat (Bao,  et at.,  2002) 

In  real  sequencing  data,  the  sequencing  quality  is 
unreliable in  the front region  of every sequencing  data, 
and  this  low-correctness  appears  in  the  rear  region  of 
sequencing  data  too.  So,  some  read  data  could  be 
assembled  into several  different contigs,  although  they 
could  be  merged  into one  in  the  end.  Therefore,  if one 
contig's end  region  is  very similar to the other,  the two 
contigs  could  be  merged 
longer  contig. 
However, this concept is not used in our simulations; we 
assumed  that  every  read  has  no  low-quality  (thus, 
unreliable) region.  In the initial version  of assembly,  we 
merged  436  contigs  into  initial  version  of eight  longer 
contigs. However, the newly assembled eight contigs still 
had to be re-checked for their feasibility. 

into  one 

Mate-pair information was  used for consistency.  If a 
region  consists of contiguously overlapping  mate-pairs, 
that region is supposed to be well assembled. This idea 
is derived from the simulation  No  4.  From the  previous 
simulation results, we further split 8 contigs into 49 stable 
contigs (or unitigs1 OJ). 

The iterative splitting procedure converges to a graph 
composed  solely of rightful  mate  pair edges  only.  The 
best way to split suspected edges is to remove one of its 
low-multiplicity  edges  because  high-multiplicity  edges 
typically  connect  the  most  conserved  positions  in  the 
repeat (Pevzner,  eta/., 2004). 

Ordering and scaffolding 
For the following process, we used 384 FOSMID clones

arrow  indicates  one  of 49  refined  contigs,  and  red  arcs 
indicates FOSMID mate-pair information. 

as  long-ranged  mate-pair  information.  As  we  ordered 
contigs by using mate-pair information in our simulations, 
we ordered 49 contigs  into  12 scaffolds11)  successfully 
(Fig.  12). For additional ordering information, we used a 
physical  map of Zymomonas mobilis genome (Kang  et 
a/.,  1998). In Kang eta/., A physical map of the Z.  mobilis 
ZM4  genome  was  constructed  by  aligning  Pmel 
fragments  and  Pacl  fragments  with  each  other  by 
reciprocal  Southern  blot  hybridization.  Seven  genomic 
Notl  fragments  were  also  used  (Fig.  16-a).  As  in  Fig. 
16-b, we could arrange 12 scaffolds in appropriate order 
by using the physical map. However, the physical map in 
(Kang  et a/.,  1998).  was slightly different from  our final 
result,  but  the differences  between  Fig.  13-a  and  13-b 
could  be left out of account (Table 4). 

Annotation of Zymomonas mobilis 
After  the  ordering  process  had  been  completed,  we 
closed  all  gaps  through  PCR  or  sometimes  through 
additional  shotgun.  Finally,  we analyzed the completed 
genome sequence to annotate the characteristics of the 
genome  sequence.  The  final  length  of the  completed 
genome sequence was 2,056,416bp.  Detailed  analysis 
result of annotation  is  presented  in  (Seo eta/.,  2005,  in 
press). 

Result and Discussion 

Assembly software aims to make correct contigs and 
then re-arrange the contigs in appropriate order. But, real 
biological  sequences contain some patterns of repeat 
that make assembly process extremely complicated.  In 
this paper, we simulated fragment assembly processes

Some  recently  developed  assembly  softwares  use 
mate-pair information so that it makes contig  sequence 
more accurate (Batzoglou eta/., 2002). We chose Phrap 
and  Arachne  for  a  rigorous  benchmarking  study.  But, 
spurious contigs were still  inevitable -even though the 
~xisting assembly softwares adopted mate-pair information, 
1t  still  makes  an  assembly  problem  if  the  source 
sequence 
repeats. 
Biological editors of genome sequence have to observe 
the mate-pair information  of assembly results  carefully, 
and modify the results in a repetitive fashion to constantly 
improve the final result of assembly.
