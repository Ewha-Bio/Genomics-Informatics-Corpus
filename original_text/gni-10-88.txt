Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an essential role in the regulation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and triglyceride 
levels, which have been closely associated with cardiovascular diseases. Genetic studies in European have shown that LPL 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are strongly associated with lipid levels. However, studies about the influence of 
interactions  between  LPL  SNPs  and  lifestyle  factors  have  not  been  sufficiently  performed.  Here,  we  examine  if  LPL 
polymorphisms, as well as their interaction with lifestyle factors, influence lipid concentrations in a Korean population. A 

two-stage association study was performed using genotype data for SNPs on the LPL gene, including the 3′ flanking region 
from 7,536 (stage 1) and 3,703 (stage 2) individuals. The association study showed that 15 SNPs and 4 haplotypes were 
−15). Interactions 
strongly associated with HDLC (lowest p = 2.86 × 10
−4) were also observed on lipid concentrations. These 
between LPL polymorphisms and lifestyle factors (lowest p = 9.6 × 10
findings suggest that there are interaction effects of LPL polymorphisms with lifestyle variables, including energy intake, fat 
intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption, as well as effects of LPL polymorphisms themselves, on lipid concentrations in a 
Korean population.

Introduction

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays an important role in the 
metabolism and transport of lipids. It hydrolyzes triglycerides 
(TGs) in lipoproteins, such as chylomicrons (CMs) and very 
low-density  lipoproteins  (VLDLs),  into  free  fatty  acids, 
releasing CM remnants and intermediate-density lipopro-
teins that act on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) 
metabolism. Plasma LPL therefore plays an essential role in 
elevating HDLC and lowering TG [1-3].

While HDLC plays a role in the removal and transport of 
cholesterol from peripheral tissues to other tissues where it 
is required, such as the liver, low-density lipoprotein chole-
sterol (LDLC) is, conversely, transported from the liver to 
peripheral  tissues.  The  concentration  of  lipids  has  been 
tightly associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases 
[4-6]. Specifically, LDLC levels have been shown to have a 
positive log-linear association with the risk of coronary heart 
disease: a reduction of 1% in the serum concentration of 
LDLC has been shown to reduce the relative risk of coronary

heart  disease  risk  by  approximately  1%  [7],  whereas  an 
increase of 1 mg/dL in serum HDLC levels is associated with 
a  decrease  in  the  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease  of 
approximately 2% to 3%, independent of LDLC levels [8]. It 
was also reported that TG levels are associated with risk of 
cardiovascular  disease,  independent  of  concentrations  of 
other lipids and cardiac risk factors, although there has been 
controversy  [6].  Recently,  a  report  based  on  the  Korea 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys I, II, III, 
and IV has indicated that the prevalence of dyslipidemia and 
hypertriglyceridemia in this country has increased during 
the  last  decade  [9].  Genetic  association  studies  aimed  at 
identifying the genetic factors associated with variations in 
lipid  concentrations  have  been  performed  mostly  for 
Europeans, and they have shown that the polymorphisms in 
the LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region, are strongly 
associated  with  HDLC  and  TG  levels  [10-13].  There  is  a 
report of a candidate gene approach for lipid concentrations 
in a Korean population, but the LPL gene was not included in 
the study [14].

The concentration of lipids is also influenced by environ-
mental factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, 
and  physical  activity,  as  well  as  genetic  factors  [5,  15]. 
However,  studies  about  the  influence  of  interactions 
between LPL polymorphisms and lifestyle factors have not 
been sufficiently performed. In this study, we examined the 
effects of potential interactions between LPL polymorphisms 
and lifestyle, as well as genetic variations of the LPL gene, 
including  the  3'  flanking  region,  on  the  lipid  profile  of  a 
Korean population.

Methods
Subjects

Data  for  this  study  were  obtained  from  the  Korean 
Genome  Epidemiology  Study  (KoGES),  conducted  by  the 
Korean  National  Institute  of  Health  (KNIH).  The  study 
comprised two stages. In the first stage, a cross-sectional 
analysis  was  conducted  of  samples  from  urban  and  rural

stage, the study was replicated in other urban regions in 
Korea.  Subjects  who  were  examined  in  the  first  stage, 
described in a previous report [16], were recruited from a 
rural  (Ansung)  and  an  urban  (Ansan)  community  from 
South Korea, which have been studied since 2001 as a part of 
KoGES. In total, 5,018 and 5,020 subjects from the Ansung 
and  Ansan  communities,  respectively,  participated  in  the 
study. The age of the participants ranged from 40 to 69 years. 
Samples were scrutinized for quality control purposes, after 
which  8,842  subjects  remained  in  our  sample  [16].  We 
further excluded 1,306 subjects who were on medication for 
hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, and hyperlipi-
demia. Information about the lifestyle of the subjects was 
based on their responses to questionnaires. 

For the second stage of the study, 4,302 samples were 
obtained from both urban regions, Seoul and Busan, in South 
Korea that were established from 2006 to 2007 as part of 
KoGES. Samples satisfying any of the following criteria were 
excluded:  i)  gender  inconsistencies,  ii)  genotype  call  rate 
lower than 95%, iii) excessive heterozygosity, iv) cryptic first 
degree relative, v) outliers on a multidimensional scaling 
plot, or vi) cancer history. A total of 3,703 subjects remained 
in  our  sample.  These  exclusion  criteria  for  samples  have 
been described [17]. Details of the sample characteristics are 
listed in Table 1. 

Genotyping

We  obtained  genotype  data  for  single-nucleotide  poly-
morphisms (SNPs) located in the LPL gene, including the 3' 
flanking region, from KoGES, which are accessible to the 
research  community  through  the  Korean  Associated 
Resource project. The study protocol was approved by the 
Institutional Review Board of KNIH. For genotyping of the 
samples from the Ansung and Ansan cohorts, Affymetrix 
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa 
Clara, CA, USA) was used. Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human 
SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix Inc.) was used for genotyping 
samples from the Seoul and Busan cohorts. The Bayesian 
Robust  Linear  Model  with  the  Mahalanobis  distance 
algorithm was used to determine the genotypes at each SNP 
of  Affymetrix  5.0.  The  BirdSeed  calling  genotyping  algo-
rithm was used on Affymetrix 6.0. The SNPs were filtered if 
any of the following criteria was met: i) a call rate lower than 
95%, ii) a minor allele frequency (MAF) lower than 0.05, or 
iii)  significant  deviation  from  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equili-
brium  (HWE).  Significant  deviation  from  HWE  for  28 
successfully  genotyped  SNPs  was  determined  based  on  a 
threshold of p ＜ 0.002 (0.05/28).

SNP imputation was performed using the IMPUTE pro-

gram  (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute.html). 
A  reference  panel  from  International  HapMap  (phase 
II/release  22/NCBI build 36  and  dbSNP  build  126) data, 
comprising SNPs from 90 Japanese (JPT) and Han Chinese 
(CHB)  individuals,  was  used  as  a  template  for  inferring 
untyped genotypes. Imputed SNPs that were located in the 
LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region, with low quality 
were  excluded  according  to  the  following  criteria:  low 
genotype information content (information lower than 0.5), 
a posterior probability score lower than 0.90, a call rate lower 
than 0.95, and MAF lower than 0.05.

Biochemical measures

Biochemical data from KoGES were obtained through the 
Korean  Association  Resource  (KARE)  project.  Blood 
samples were obtained from the participants with at least 8 
hours of overnight fasting. Serum total cholesterol (TCHL), 
HDLC,  and  TG  concentrations  were  measured  using  the 
Advia 1650 analyzer (Siemens, Tarrytown, NY, USA) for the 
Ansung and Ansan cohorts and the Hitachi 7600 analyzer 
(Hitachi,  Tokyo,  Japan)  for  the  Seoul  and  Busan  study 
cohorts [16, 17]. LDLC concentration was estimated using 
the equation by Friedewald et al. [18] for individuals with TG 
levels lower than 400 mg/dL.

Statistics

To test the association between LPL SNPs and haplotypes 
(HTs)  and  lipid  concentration,  linear  regression  analyses, 
adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index (BMI), were 
performed. For stage 1 and imputed data, the residence area 
of each participant was additionally adjusted. The influence 
of the interaction between LPL SNPs and lifestyle variables 
on  lipid  levels  was  analyzed  by  using  linear  regression, 
including  main  and  interaction  effects,  adjusted  for  resi-
dence area, age, gender, and BMI. The effect of energy and fat 
intake,  physical  activity,  smoking,  and  drinking  status  on 
lipid profiles was examined. Energy intake, fat intake, and 
physical  activity  were  measured  as  the  total  intake  of 
kilocalories  per  day,  daily  fat  intake,  and  metabolic  equi-
valent scores per hour, respectively. Smoking status had two 
categories,  non-smokers  and  smokers,  and  alcohol  con-
sumption was divided into non-drinkers and drinkers. These 
lifestyle factors were available for subjects from stage 1 and 
imputed data but not from stage 2. 

All analyses were performed by log-transforming HDLC, 
TG,  and  TCHL  values  to  normalize  their  distribution. 
Untransformed LDLC values were used for all analyses. To 
determine the effect of SNPs, untransformed lipid concen-
trations were used.

JA  Pyun,  et  al.  Interaction  of  LPL  SNP  with  Lifestyle

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) block partition was perfor-
med  by  Gabriel’s  rule,  applied  in  Haploview  version  4.1 
(Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, Boston, MA, 
USA), and HT inference was performed using the expec-
tation  maximization  algorithm  with  PLINK  version  1.07 
(http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink). All statistical 
analyses were performed in an additive model (AA vs. AB vs. 
BB or ＋/＋ vs. ＋/− vs. −/−) using PLINK.

Results
Association of LPL SNPs with lipid concentrations

We sequentially discarded 6 SNPs with MAF ＜ 0.05, 2 
SNPs with call rate ＜ 95%, and 1 SNP with HWE p-value ＜ 
0.002, leaving 19 SNPs for the association study at stage 1. 
Our  results  show  that  SNPs  located  in  the  LPL  gene, 
including the 3' flanking region, were strongly associated 
with HDLC and TG levels. The linear regression, adjusted for 
age, gender, and BMI, using combined data from the two 
study stages, revealed that 15 SNPs were associated with 
HDLC and TG levels (Table 2). The strongest associations 
were between rs10503669 and both HDLC (combined p = 
−22; 2.2-mg/dL increase per minor T allele) and TG 
3.6 × 10
−15; 13.6-mg/dL decrease per minor T 
(combined p = 3 × 10
allele) in additive models. However, no strong association 
was detected between the SNP and either LDLC or TCHL 
levels (Supplementary Fig. 1).

−6 and p = 7.2 × 10

−10  and  p  =  2.5  ×  10

For  LPL  SNPs,  we  tested  2  intronic  SNPs  and  2  SNPs 
located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) from stage 1. Of 
these, two SNPs in the 3' UTR (rs11570892 and rs3200218) 
were  not  significantly  associated  with  any  lipid  concen-
tration (Supplementary Table 1). Two intronic SNPs, rs263 
and  rs271,  were  significantly  associated  to  higher  HDLC 
−11;  1.2-  and 
levels  (p  =  1.2  ×  10
1.3-mg/dL increase per minor A and T allele, respectively) 
−7; 8.8- 
and lower TG levels (p = 1.7 × 10
and 9-mg/dL decrease per minor A and T allele, respectively) 
(Table 2). In stage 2, 7 intronic SNPs and 2 SNPs that were 
located in the 3' UTR were tested. It was found that rs263 
and  rs271  were  also  strongly  associated  with  increased 
−6, respectively; both 
HDLC (p = 5.5 × 10
showed  a  1.5-mg/dL  increase  per  minor  A  and  T  allele) 
−3 and p = 
(Table 2) and decreased TG levels (p = 3.3 × 10
−3; 8.6- and 8.7-mg/dL decrease per minor A and T 
2.2 × 10
allele, respectively). Additionally, 4 intronic SNPs (rs253, 
rs326, rs327, and rs12679834) were significantly associated 
−9, p = 
with increased HDLC (p = 4.2 × 10
−14; increase of 0.8, 2.1, 2.1, and 
1.6 × 10
3.3 mg/dL per minor allele, respectively) and decreased TG 
−7 and 
levels (p = 3.6 × 10
−6; increase of 7.4, 12.2, 12.3, and 13.7 mg/dL 
p = 1.3 × 10

−9 and p = 3.1 × 10

−6 and p = 5.1 × 10

−3, p = 9.1 × 10

−7, p = 5.9 × 10

−3, p = 1.5 × 10

Association of LPL HTs with lipid concentration

Two blocks, including SNPs located in the LPL gene, were 
identified (Supplementary Fig. 2), and the association of HT 
with lipid profiles for the two blocks was examined. The 
analysis using combined data from the two stages showed 
that block 2, which includes SNPs located in the LPL gene, 
including  the  3'  flanking  region,  was  the  region  most 
strongly associated with lipid concentrations (Table 3). HT3 
in  block  2  was  strongly  associated  with  increased  HDLC

between HT and either LDLC or TCHL.

The  analysis  using  imputed  data  also  showed  a  strong 
association between HTs and lipid levels in the 2 blocks, 
including LPL SNPs (Supplementary Table 3). HT1 in block 
2 was significantly associated with a reduced HDLC level (p

Effect of the interaction between polymorphisms 
located in the LPL gene and lifestyle on lipid 
concentration

We tested LPL SNPs and HTs from stage 1. All significant 
associations were found in the results of the dominant model 
for the minor allele. The association of minor alleles for 3 
SNPs (rs263, rs271, rs328) with higher HDLC levels also 
depended on energy intake (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of these, 
the minor alleles of 2 SNPs (rs263, rs271) were associated 
with lower TG levels, also depending on energy intake. The 
association of the minor alleles of two SNPs (rs263, rs271) 
with higher HDLC levels also depended on fat intake (Fig. 1). 
The  minor  alleles  of  2  SNPs  (rs263,  rs271)  were  also 
associated  with  higher  HDLC  levels  and  lower  TG  levels

lower  TG  levels  through  an  interaction  with  alcohol

effects of HT1 and 2 in block 1, which were formed by two 
SNP (rs271, rs263) in strong LD (r2 = 0.99), with lifestyle 
factors on HDLC and TG levels were found to be almost 
same with those of rs271 and rs263 (data not shown). In 
block 2, HT3 was associated with higher HDLC levels and 
lower TG levels and depended on an interaction with energy 
intake (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). HT4 in block 2 was 
associated with lower TG levels through an interaction with 
cigarette  smoking  (Supplementary  Fig.  4).  For  the 
interaction  between  LPL  polymorphisms  and  physical 
activity, there was no significant association with any lipid 
levels.

Discussion

The human LPL gene is located on chromosome 8p22 and 
includes 10 exons encoding 475 amino acids, of which 448 
amino acids are part of the mature protein and 27 of the 
signal  peptide  [19,  20].  LPL  has  an  essential  role  in  the 
metabolism  of  lipids,  as  it  hydrolyzes  a  number  of 
substrates,  such  as  long-  and  short-chain  glycerides  and 
phospholipids in vitro, as well as major substrates, such as 
CMs and VLDL in vivo [21]. Dysfunction of LPL has been 
reported  to  be  associated  with  chylomicronemia,  athero-

[22].

Genetic association studies have shown that some SNPs 
located in the LPL gene, including the 3' flanking region, are 
strongly  associated  with  HDLC  and  TG  levels,  mostly  in 
Europeans.  Specifically,  by  performing  meta-analyses  of 
genomewide association studies, Aulchenko et al. [13] found 
that rs2083637 and rs10096633 were associated with HDLC 
and TG levels, and it was also demonstrated that rs325 and 
rs10105606,  reported  by  Waterworth  et  al.  [11],  and 
rs12678919,  reported  by  Kathiresan  et  al.  [23],  were 
associated  with  HDLC  and  TG  levels.  Studies  using  the 
candidate  gene  approach,  which  examines  the  effects  of 
genetic variants of a putative gene in an association, have 
reported that some LPL SNPs are associated with HDLC and 
TG levels. Tang et al. [24] recently revealed that rs326 and 
rs328 (which convert serine to a stop codon) and rs13702 are 
associated with HDLC and TG levels in African-Americans 
and European-American populations.

Here, rs263 and rs271, located, respectively, in introns 5 
and 6, were strongly associated with increased HDLC and 
decreased  TG  levels  (Table  2).  The  two  significant  SNPs 
formed an HT block with strong LD (r2 = 0.99) in stage 1, 
and rs3200218, located in the 3' UTR, formed another HT 
block with 15 SNPs located in the 3' flanking region. At stage 
2, nine SNPs in the LPL gene remained after SNP filtering, 
out of which six were significantly associated with HDLC 
levels (Supplementary Table 2). SNPs rs343, rs253, rs263, 
and rs271, located, respectively, in introns 3, 4, 5, and 6, 

formed an HT block with moderate LD (r2  ＞ 0.3). SNPs 
rs326,  rs327,  rs12679834,  rs11570892n,  and  rs3200218 
formed another HT block with 31 SNPs located in the 3' 
flanking region. In the two blocks at stages 1 and 2, some HTs 
were found to be strongly associated with HDLC and TG 
levels (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). The analysis using 
the combined data from both stages showed that HTs were 
also significantly associated with HDLC and TG levels (Table 
3). Using the imputation data, we found that more LPL SNPs 
were included in the two blocks. HTs that were significantly 
associated with lipid profiles were also identified (Supple-
mentary Table 3). 

The strongest association of HT with HDLC and TG levels 
was observed in block 2 (from both stages). A previous study 
reported  that  one  HT  was  associated  with  increased  LPL 
activity [25]. The HT was found to be consistent with HT3 in 
block 2, found using stage 1 and imputed data, which was 
associated  here  with  increased  HDLC  and  decreased  TG 
levels.  In  block  2,  we  found  that  one  SNP,  rs328,  which 
converts serine to a stop codon, was included using imputed 
data. Interestingly, the minor allele G of rs328 was found 
only in HT3. It has been reported that this minor allele is 
associated  with  increased  HDLC  and  decreased  TG 
concentrations in Japanese [26] and European populations 
[10, 27], and our results support this finding. This truncated 
variant  was  also  demonstrated  to  have  higher  catalytic 
activity [28-30]. 

SNP  rs328  has  been  reported  to be  in  strong  LD  with 
rs17482753 in European (r2 = 1) and African (r2 = 0.852)

inconsistent association with LDLC levels in stages 1 and 2 
of this study.

Some environmental factors have been suggested to be 
associated with lipid profiles. Physical activity was reported 
to be associated with higher HDLC and lower TG and TCHL 
concentrations [34], whereas smoking was reported to be 
associated with higher LDLC and TG and lower HDLC levels 
[35, 36]. Alcohol consumption was suggested to be associated 
with  increased  HDLC  levels  [37,  38],  whereas  excessive 
alcohol consumption was associated with a higher TG level 
[39]. A low fat intake, in turn, was associated with reduced 
TCHL, LDLC, and HDLC and increased TG levels [40]. Some 
LPL SNPs have also been shown to be associated with lipid 
profiles  through  their  interaction  with  smoking,  alcohol 
consumption, and physical activity. Specifically, rs320 has 
been  suggested  to  interact  with  smoking  [41,  42]  and 
physical activity [42], and rs1801177 interacts with physical 
activity  [43].  The  SNP  rs328,  which  is  a  nonsense  SNP 
included in our imputed data, has been associated with HDL 
through 
interaction  with  smoking  and  alcohol 
consumption in females but not in males [44]. In a recent 
study,  however,  the  interaction  of  several  LPL  SNPs, 
including rs328, with alcohol consumption was suggested to 
have no influence on HDLC levels [45].

its 

In  this  study,  we  show  that  the  effects  of  some  LPL 
polymorphisms on lipid concentrations were regulated by 
several environmental factors. Carriers of each minor allele 
of 3 SNPs (rs263, rs271, and rs328) were associated with 
slightly higher HDLC levels, depending on an interaction 
with energy intake. This effect, however, was not observed 
among non-carriers (Supplementary Fig. 3). In two of these 
SNPs (rs263 and rs271), which were in strong LD (r2 = 0.99 
in stages 1 and 2), each major genotype carrier led to higher 
levels  of  TG,  whereas  the  TG  levels  of  each  minor  allele 
carrier were not affected by a higher energy intake. Carriers 
of each minor allele, but not non-carriers, led to a higher 
HDLC level through an interaction with a higher intake of fat 
(Fig. 1). Each major genotype carrier of two SNPs (rs263 and 
rs271) showed lower HDLC levels and higher TG levels than 
minor allele carriers through an interaction with smoking 
(Fig. 2). In the major genotype carrier of these two SNPs, 
higher TG levels were also found by interacting with alcohol 
consumption (Supplementary Fig. 4), whereas each minor 
allele carrier was less affected than non-carriers by smoking 
or alcohol consumption. 

For interactions of HTs, blocks 1 and 2 were shown to 
interact  with  inconsistent  lifestyle  variables.  Interaction 
effects of HT1 and 2 in block 1 with lifestyle factors, which 
were formed by the two SNPs, on lipid levels were almost 
same with those of rs263 and rs271 (data not shown). In the 
LPL gene, 61 missense mutations have been identified, and

populations [31]. rs17482753 was genotyped in stage 1 and 
2 of this study, and the SNP was found to be in strong LD 
with rs328, according to the imputed data (r2 = 0.993). We 
additionally identified strong LD (r2 = 0.93) between rs328 
and  rs17482753  by  using  genotype  data  of  830  Korean 
participants obtained from a previous study [32], in which 
samples in stage 1 of this study were included. Similar to the 
results  of  rs328  obtained  using  the  imputed  data  in  this 
study, the rs17482753 minor allele was found to be strongly 
associated with raised  HDLC  and  reduced TG  levels  in  a 
dominant manner at both stages.

In a previous study, LPL SNPs located in the 3' UTR region 
were considered possible targets affecting miRNA binding 
sites,  and  5  SNPs  were  predicted  to  be  putative  miRNA 
binding sites by polymiRTS [33]. The 3' UTR region of the 
LPL gene was included in block 2 in this study, and two of the 
predicted  5  SNPs  were  tested  (Supplementary  Table  1). 
Rs1059611  major  allele  T  from  the  imputed  data  was 
significantly associated with reduced levels of HDLC and 
LDLC and with increased TG levels in an additive manner. In 
this SNP, the major T allele was predicted to create a new 
miRNA  (miR-136)  binding  site,  causing  abnormal  repre-
ssion  of  this  gene.  The  major  allele  of  another  SNP, 
rs11570892, was predicted to disrupt a conserved miRNA 
(miR-592)  binding  site,  and  this  could  cause  abnormal 
control of normal repression. However, this SNP showed

interestingly, 42 of them are located in exons 5 and 6, which 
may be contained in block 1 [46]. Carrier of HT3 in block 2, 
which  was  reported  to  be  associated  with  increased  LPL 
activity  [25],  showed  higher  HDLC  levels  and  lower  TG 
levels, whereas non-carriers were not affected by a higher 
energy intake (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 3). In the non- 
carrier of HT4 in block 2, higher TG levels were found by 
interacting with cigarette smoking (Supplementary Fig. 4). 
Smoking and moderate alcohol consumption were reported 
to  be  related  with  reduced  and  increased  LPL  activity, 
respectively [47, 48], but the precise mechanisms by which 
the interaction of LPL polymorphisms with environmental 
factors affects lipid concentrations have not been demon-
strated yet.

In conclusion, we found that HTs are strongly associated 
with HDLC and TG levels in the 2 blocks in which LPL SNPs 
are included and that SNPs in these blocks are also strongly 
associated with HDLC and TG levels in stage 1. Interestingly, 
these results were replicated in stage 2, which consists of 
independent samples, and the combined analyses, including 
the samples of stages 1 and 2, showed the most significant 
results. Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the interaction 
of  LPL  polymorphisms  with  several  lifestyle  factors  on 
plasma lipid levels, we have shown that the effects of some 
LPL  SNPs  and  HTs  on  HDLC  and  TG  concentrations  are 
regulated  by  energy  and  fat  intake,  smoking,  and  alcohol 
consumption. Since these results have not been reported in 
any previous studies, they are novel findings. These interac-
tion  effects  suggest  that  the  appropriate  lifestyle  of  each 
individual could be recommended according to the type of 
LPL polymorphism. These results should be confirmed in 
other populations and in a longitudinal study.
