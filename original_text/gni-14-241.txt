Environmental microbes like Bordetella petrii has been established as a causative agent for various infectious diseases in 
human. Again, development of drug resistance in B. petrii challenged to combat against the infection. Identification of 
potential drug target and proposing a novel lead compound against the pathogen has a great aid and value. In this study, 
bioinformatics  tools  and  technology  have  been  applied  to  suggest  a  potential  drug  target  by  screening  the  proteome 
information  of  B.  petrii  DSM  12804  (accession  No.  PRJNA28135)  from  genome  database  of  National  Centre  for 
Biotechnology information. In this regards, the inhibitory effect of nine natural compounds like ajoene (Allium sativum), 
allicin (A. sativum), cinnamaldehyde (Cinnamomum cassia), curcumin (Curcuma longa), gallotannin (active component of 
green tea and red wine), isoorientin (Anthopterus wardii), isovitexin (A. wardii), neral (Melissa officinalis), and vitexin (A. 
wardii) have been acknowledged with anti-bacterial properties and hence tested against identified drug target of B. petrii by 
implicating computational approach. The in silico studies revealed the hypothesis that lpxD could be a potential drug target 
and with recommendation of a strong inhibitory effect of selected natural compounds against infection caused due to B. 
petrii, would be further validated through in vitro experiments.

Introduction

Infectious diseases are major dreadful threat to human 
life,  spread  through  many  causative  agents  like  bacteria, 
fungus, virus, etc. Therefore, development of potential drug 
is  highly  essential  to  fight  against  infectious  diseases. 
Generally, methods of traditional drug design are tedious, 
time  consuming,  and  cost  intensive.  Hence,  several 
multidisciplinary approaches have gained research attention 
to  reduce  the  time  and  cost  during  drug  development 
process.  In  silico  drug  design  is  one  of  such  approach, 
provides remarkable opportunity for identification of novel 
lead  compounds  as  comparison  to  other  conventional 
methods.  Drug  target  identification  is  an  important  step 
involved  in  computer  aided  drug  design  process.  In  this 
context, the present study is planned to identify a potential 
drug target against infectious diseases caused by Bordetella 

petrii using various computational tools and techniques. B. 
petrii  is  a  gram-negative  coccobacilli  of  the  phylum  Pro-
teobacteria, has been found exclusively in close association 
with humans and various warm-blooded animals due to its 
independent  existence  as  an  environmental  facultative 
anaerobe  [1].  B.  petrii  exhibits  the  host  associated  pro-
perties,  and  its  strains  have  been  detected  from  enviro-
nmental  samples  like  microbial  consortia  degrading  aro-
matic compounds, marine sponges, polluted soil and a grass 
root  consortium  [2-6].  The  genome  of  B.  petrii  contains 
5,287,950 base pairs, and has been observed with greatest 
numbers  of  expressed  virulence  factors  [7].  Infectious 
diseases  like  mandibular  osteomyelitis  [8],  suppurative 
mastoiditis [9], chronic pulmonary diseases [10], respiratory 
infection in case of bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis [11, 12] 
have been reported due to B. petrii infection. Again, exposure 
to  soil  or  water  containing  B.  petrii  may  lead  to  local 
colonization and eventually serious nosocomial infections

[13,  14].  Some  other  bacteria  like  Escherichia  coli  [15], 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa [16], Chlamydophila pneumoniae [17], 
Staphylococcus  aureus  [18],  and  Haemophilus  influenzae  [19] 
have  also  been  identified  as  a  cause  for  such  types  of 
infections.  Many  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA) 
approved drugs have been used against these pathogens, but 
those drugs have less effect on B. petrii due to development of 
substantial  resistance  [10],  generated  an  opportunity  to 
identify a potential drug target as well as to discover a novel 
lead  compound  against  B.  petrii  using  computational 
techniques.  Again,  due  to  adverse  effect  of  most  of  the 
anti-infectious drugs of synthetic origin, natural compounds 
with anti-infectious properties have been tested in both in 
vivo and in vitro to be an alternative approach towards the 
treatment. In this context, some of the natural compounds 
such  as  ajoene  (Allium  sativum),  allicin  (A.  sativum), 
cinnamaldehyde  (Cinnamomum  cassia),  curcumin  (Curcuma 
longa), gallotannin (active component of green tea and red 
wine), isoorientin (Anthopterus wardii), isovitexin (A. wardii), 
neral (Melissa officinalis), and vitexin (A. wardii) have been 
acknowledged  with  anti-bacterial  properties  [20-25]. 
Curcumin is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound, a 
common  component  of  Indian  spice  turmeric,  having 
anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. 
It has been reported as an agent to reduce bacterial colony 
formation and inhibit lung cancer progression in high-risk 
chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  patients 
[20]. Similarly, gallotannin is an active component of green 
tea and red wine has been observed as a potent inhibitor of 
–
calcium-activated Cl
 channel, may be used for the treatment 
of cystic fibrosis [21]. Again, in vitro study of three flavone 
C-glycosides  such  as  isoorientin,  vitexin,  and  isovitexin 
isolated  from  A.  wardii  have  been  reported  as  potent 
inhibitors for interleukin-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-1, 
an inflammatory marker in case of COPD [22]. Moreover, 
most of the bacterial infection caused due to formation of bio 
film  in  the  host.  In  this  regard,  an  active  compound 
cinnamaldehyde of C. cassia have been identified as a strong 
inhibitor  against quorum sensing (QS)  biofilm formation 
due to E. coli, and Vibrio harveyi [23] infection. Similarly, two 
extracts of A. sativum namely allicin and ajoene have been 
accounted for inhibitory effect against P. aeruginosa and E. coli 
[24]. Likewise, neral is an active component of M. officinalis, 
has  been  reported  as  anti-bacterial,  anti-fungal,  and 
anti-oxidant  properties  against  P.  aeruginosa,  Klebsiella 
pneumoniae, S. aureus, and Citrobacter koseri infection [25], and 
may  be  applied  for  several  infectious  diseases  including 
nosocomial  infection.  As,  all  of  these  nine  natural 
compounds  have  been  established  with  anti-bacterial 
properties, may be useful for treatment of B. petrii infection, 
encouraged  authors  to  elucidate  their  inhibitory  effect 

against the putative drug target of B. petrii through in silico 
approach. 

Methods
Subtractive proteomics 

The complete protein datasets of B. petrii (whole genome 
project  accession  No.  PRJNA28135)  were  retrieved  from 
Genome  database  of  National  Centre  for  Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) web server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. 
gov/genome/). The essentiality search [26] was carried out 
through the Database of Essential Gene (DEG) for screening 
out the essential proteins responsible for the survival of B. 
petrii in the host. The bit score parameter was considered as 
greater or equal to 100 for homology search using Basic Local 
Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLAST)  while  accessing  DEG 
(http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/deg/blast.php) database, to select 
bacterial essential proteins. The non-redundancy search was 
performed through CD-HIT (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/ 
cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi)  web  server  to  remove  the 
redundant proteins among selected essential proteins of B. 
petrii.  Further,  by  considering  the  resulted  proteins  of  B. 
petrii, the sequence similarity search was carried out against 
human  [27-29]  followed  by  human  gut  flora  microo-
rganisms  [30,  31]  using  BLASTP  algorithm  to  eliminate 
proteins  homologous  with  human  and  human  gut  flora 
microorganisms respectively. During similarity search, the 
threshold for expected value (e-value) was fixed as greater or 
equal to 0.001. Furthermore, the protein sequences which 
are  putative, unknown,  hypothetical, probable,  conserved 
hypothetical and unnamed protein were removed manually. 
The  study  of  sub  cellular  localization  was  performed  to 
identify the cytoplasm proteins among the selected proteins 
[32]  using  CELLO  (http://cello.life.nctu.  edu.tw/). 
Generally, proteins are annotated and ranked as per their 
evidence level in UniProt database which is also a factor to 
be  considered  while  selecting  putative  drug  targets. 
Afterwards,  the  Virulence  Factor  Database  (VFDB)  was 
explored,  and  the  virulence  proteins  were  screened  out 
(http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/blast/blast.html)  among  the 
selected targets of B. petrii through VFDB BLASTP search 
against VFDB core data sets with consideration of threshold 
e-value as greater than 0.0001 [31]. The above methodology 
is described through a flow diagram (Fig. 1A).

Pathway analysis

The  participation  of  virulent  proteins  in  any  unique 
pathways  of  pathogen  could  be  ensured  and  analyzed 
through  the  exploration  of  databases,  is  a  common  pro-
cedure to be followed while predicting putative drug targets. 
In  this  study,  the  pathway  analysis  was  performed  using

of  subtractive  proteomics  deciphered  in  panel  A,  and  rest  in  panel  B.

Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) data-
base (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). Here, the exploration 
of KEGG database for pathway study was conducted twice. 
In the first case, the search was carried out for all obtained 
virulent proteins against existing pathways of B. petrii using 
KEGG BLAST algorithm. Secondly, unique pathways of B. 
petrii (pathways present in B. petrii, not in human) were sort 
listed from the KEGG database by comparing all pathways 
between B. petrii and human. Further, selection of common 
unique  pathways  [26,  32,  33]  was  made  between  the 
observed pathways of selected targets and obtained unique 
pathways of B. petrii. Furthermore, the selection pathways 
which are essential for the survival of the pathogen were 
made after detail inspection of obtained pathways. Finally, 
the key proteins regulating those pathways of B. petrii were 
considered as putative drug targets (Fig. 1B). 

Protein-protein network study

The  putative  drug  targets  of  B.  petrii  obtained  after 
pathway analysis were subjected for protein-protein network 
analysis using STRING (http://string-db.org/) web server. 
Here,  the  interaction  between  the  drugs  targets  were 
quantified on the basis [34] of confidence value (0.007) and 
the level of interaction (maximum as 50). The drug targets 
observed as having higher numbers of interaction with other 
drug targets among the chosen data sets were considered for 
further analysis (Fig. 1B). 

Similarity search and domain prediction

Similarly  search  was  carried  out  for  selected  proteins 
using BLASTP algorithm against Protein Data Bank (PDB) 
database (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/). The closest homolog 
for each selected target protein was considered as template 
based on lowest e-value and highest percentage of similarity.

The conserved domain region of potential drug target was 
predicted using conserved domain database (CDD) of NCBI 
web  server  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/ 
wrpsb.cgi) with default parameters (Fig. 1B).

Structure prediction and evaluation

Phyre2 (Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine) 
server was used for modelling of three dimensional structure 
of putative drug target of B. petrii. The algorithm of Phyre2 
server  predict  three  dimensional  structure  of  a  protein 
sequence using the principles and techniques of homology 
and/or fold recognition, as structural folding pattern is more 
conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence. Hence, 
a  protein  of  interest  (drug  target)  can  be  modelled  with 
reasonable  accuracy  basing  on  a  distantly  related  protein 
with  known  (template)  structure  [35].  The  energetically 
stable structure was obtained through structural refinement 
and energy minimization using ModRefiner algorithm [36] 
of Zhang Lab web server (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ 
ModRefiner/).  The  structural  superimposition  of  refined 
model with template model was performed using Discovery 
Studio  3.5  suite.  The  structural  quality  and  reliability  of 
refined  model  were  evaluated  using  RAMPAGE  [37], 
ProSA-web [38], Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) [39], and 
ERRAT [40] web tools.

Preparation of natural compounds

The chemical structures of nine phytochemicals (ajoene, 
allicin, cinnamaldehyde, curcumin, gallotannin, isoorientin, 
isovitexin, neral, and vitexin) were downloaded from Pub-
Chem database of NCBI web server (http://ncbi.nlm.nih. 
gov/pccompound).  The  correction  of  structural  geometry 
and energy minimization were carried out using Discovery 
Studio 3.5 suites.

Molecular docking 

Molecular  docking  between  the  predicted  model  of 
potential  drug  target  with  each  of  the  nine  natural 
compounds was conducted using AutoDock-4.2 algorithm 
(http://autodock.scripps.edu/), by considering the protein 
structure  as  rigid  whereas  ligands  were  kept  as  flexible. 
AutoDock algorithm requires pre calculated grid maps, one 
for each atom type present in the flexible molecules being 
docked, and it stores the potential energy arising from the 
interaction with rigid macro molecules [41]. Ligands were 
docked around the identified conserved region within the 
functional domain of the selected drug target. The favorable 
poses were selected on the basis of lowest binding energy 
calculated by AutoDock which indicates for most favorable 
binding  conformation  between  receptor  and  ligands. 
Docking procedure was carried out as per normal metho-

dology for protein-ligand docking [42, 43]. The visualization 
and analysis of interaction between docked complexes were 
made using Discovery Studio 3.5 suites.

Results and Discussion
Screening of putative drug targets

Availability of whole genome information of B. petrii DSM 
12804 (accession No. PRJNA28135) in Genome database of 
NCBI web server encouraged authors to retrieve the entire 
set of 5,031 protein sequences in order to identify a potential 
drug target against it. Primarily, screening was made through 
identification of essential genes of B. petrii, considered as 
primitive strategy [26] for target identification. Here, out of 
total 5,031 proteins, only 1,841 were obtained as essential 
proteins and hence suspected as primary targets of B. petrii. 
To remove redundancy [29, 30] among the putative drug 
targets,  a  non-redundancy  search  was  carried  out  which 
resulted  1,802  proteins  as  non-redundant.  Search  for 
sequence homology with human proteins is an essential step 
to be followed for identification of proteins present only in 
pathogen but not in human [27-29]. Again, due to symbiotic 
relationship  among  human  and  human  gut  micro  biota, 
homology search between proteins of pathogen and human 
gut flora microorganisms is also a crucial step [30, 31] to be 
performed to eliminate the target proteins which are homo-
logous to human gut flora microorganism. The resulted 799 
numbers of proteins of B. petrii were not shown any signi-
ficant similarity with human proteome as well as human gut 
flora proteome, hence were selected for downstream analysis. 
Furthermore, the reduction in protein dataset was done by 
selecting  proteins  reported  as  active  and  as  well  as 
functional. Out of 799 proteins, only 509 numbers of functi-
onally  characterized  proteins  were  selected  using  the 
information available at UniProt database. As suggested by 
the  literature,  only  cytoplasm  proteins  are  suitable  drug 
targets  whereas  membrane  bound  proteins  are  generally 
considered for vaccine development [32]. Among them only 
cytoplasm  proteins  (334  numbers)  were  considered  for 
further study. Furthermore, screening was carried out on the 
basis of evidence report. As of UniProt database report, the 
evidence  which  supports  the  existence  of  proteins  are 
classified as: (1) experimental evidence at protein level; (2) 
experimental  evidence  at  transcript  level;  (3)  protein 
inferred  from  homology;  (4)  protein  predicted;  and  (5) 
protein  uncertain.  Out  of  these  evidences,  evidence  at 
protein level is the best choice for protein existence, as it 
indicates the existence of the protein experimentally. But in 
the  current  investigation,  not  a  single  protein  has  been 
observed satisfying this criterion. Only 135 proteins which 
were  inferred  from  homology  subjected  to  virtual  study.

Identification of pathogenic proteins having virulence factor 
is also obligatory [31] while screening a drug target against 
any pathogenic microorganism. Therefore, homology search 
was carried out between 135 numbers of proteins and the 
core virulence proteins of B. petrii using VFDB BLAST. The 
result  suggested,  out  of  135  selected  proteins  only  26 
number  of  proteins  found  with  virulence  factor,  which 
strongly supported for further study to predict potential drug 
target against B. petrii (Figs. 1 and 2).

Analysis of metabolic pathways

The pathway analysis was conducted to screen out the 
putative drug targets and their involvement in important and 
unique pathways of the pathogen B. petrii which are essential 
for the survival of the pathogen. The preliminary search in 
KEGG database suggested for involvement of 22 proteins in 
different important pathways of B. petrii, and therefore the 
dataset  of  putative  drug  target  reduced  from  26  to  22. 
Further,  exploration  of  all  available  pathways  for  both 
human and pathogen was conducted and compared, resulted 
38 unique pathways present in B. petrii but absent in human. 
Furthermore,  the  comparison  was  made  between  the 
identified important pathways of B. petrii for 22 drug targets 
and 38 unique pathways identified in B. petrii, resulted 12 
putative drug targets (Table 1) contributing towards the 3 

common  and  unique  pathways  of  B.  petrii  namely,  lipo-
polysaccharide  biosynthesis,  two  component  system,  and 
bacterial  chemotaxis.  As  per  literature  suggest,  lipopoly-
saccharide biosynthesis is an essential pathway [44] for the 
survival of B. petrii, a major component of the outer mem-
brane of gram negative bacteria and referred as endotoxin. It 
is comprised of a hydrophilic polysaccharide and a hydro-
phobic component referred as lipid A which is responsible 
for major bio reactivity of endotoxin [44], also serves as a 
physical barrier providing protection towards bacteria from 
its  surroundings  [45].  Intense  inspection  on  lipopoly-
saccharide biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 3) suggested, out of 
12  selected  putative  drug  targets  (Table  1)  only  eight 
numbers (lpxH, kdsB, lpxK, lpxD, lpxB, kdsA, lpxC, and 
Bpet0453)  were  as  key  regulatory  proteins  [46].  Again, 
involvement  of  two  components  namely,  amino  acid  and 
sugar  metabolism  and  pentose  phosphate  pathway  were 
found as regulating the complete pathway. lpxC, lpxD, lpxH, 
lpxB, and lpxK proteins are involved in amino acid and sugar 
metabolism, and among them lpxH was discarded as the 
synthesis  of  lpxB  could  alternatively  possible  by  lpxD. 
Further, lpxB and lpxK were also rejected as potential drug 
target as the regulation of kdtA and waaA through lpxB and 
lpxK were otherwise possible by the proteins involved in 
pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, Bpet0453 (5.3.1.13),

kdsA (2.5.1.55), and kdsB (2.7.7.38) proteins were found as 
key proteins of pentose phosphate metabolism components 
(Fig. 3), and regulating synthesis of kdtA and waaA, but the 
synthesis  of  same  proteins  was  also  control  by  proteins 
involved in amino acid and sugar metabolism to carried out 
the  whole  lipopolysaccharide  biosynthesis.  So  the  key 
proteins kdsA, kdsB, and Bpet0453 of pentose phosphate 
pathway were discarded. Finally, two proteins namely lpxD 
and lpxC were selected on the basis of their highly invo-
lvement in the regulation of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis 
pathway than any other proteins (Figs. 2B and 3). 

Protein network analysis

Protein network analysis is generally used for selection of 
drug targets having interaction with maximum numbers of 
other drug targets, an efficient technique to discover a potent 
drug  target  against  pathogens  [34].  Here,  the  biological 
interaction  was  studied  for  2  obtained  drug  targets  of  B. 
petrii, and the assessment supported for both lpxD (with 
lpxC, lpxB, kdsA, kdsB, lpxH, lpxK, and bpet0453) and lpxC 
(with lpxD, lpxB, kdsA, kdsB, lpxK, and bpet0453) proteins 
showing  interaction  with  other  drug  targets  among  the 
chosen data set (Table 2, Fig. 4). Therefore, lpxD and lpxC 
proteins were strongly recommended to be potential drug 
targets against the pathogen B. petrii. 

Identification of potent drug target and domain 
prediction

Further,  template  structure  identification  for  lpxD  and 
lpxC  proteins  were  undergone  through  similarity  search 
against  PDB.  The  template  protein  structure  (PDB  ID: 
3PMO) from P. aeruginosa was selected for the drug target 

lpxD of B. petrii with 91% query coverage and 49% of identity 
where  as  template  structure  (PDB  ID:  4FW3)  from  P. 
aeruginosa  for  lpxC  protein  of  B.  petrii  with  88%  query 
coverage and 56% of identity (Table 3). Though, it has been 
already established that lpxC catalyzes initially during the 
biosynthesis of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide 
and  may  be  a  potent  drug  target  to  block  the  lipopoly-
saccharide pathway of pathogens [47], the current investi-
gation suggested, the status of lpxC protein B. petrii as un 
reviewed (Table 3) and have shown less number of interac-
tion with other drug targets in comparison to lpxD (Table 2). 
Again,  as  per  literature  report,  lpxD  has  a  key  role  in 
biosynthesis  of  the  lipid  A  component  of  lipopoly-
saccharide, and its inhibitors are also potentially attractive as 
antibacterial  agents,  as  there  is  no  close  similarity  found 
with human proteins [48]. Also, lpxD has a vital role in bio 
film formation which is causing nosocomial infection [16] 
and the status obtained from UniProt web server as reviewed 
(Table 3). This seems lpxD could be a potential drug target 
against B. petrii infection. Therefore, lpxD was proposed as a 
potent  drug  target  subjected  for  further  in  silico  study. 
Through BLAST search and inspection in CDD database, the 
conserved amino acid resides within the left-handed parallel 
beta helix (LbH) domain of lpxD were identified (Fig. 5A), 
containing three imperfect tandem repeats of a hexapeptide 
repeat motif (X-[STAV]-X-[LIV]-[GAED]-X).

Structure prediction and refinement of proposed 
drug target

Due  to  absence  of  experimental  structure  the  tertiary 
model of lpxD (UniProt ID: A9INS9) protein was predicted 
by the single highest scoring template i.e., lpxD protein of P.

aeruginosa (PDB ID: 3PMO, chain A) using phyre2 [35] web 
server with 100% confidence. Protein attains the lowest free 
energy during the native state; therefore the stability of the 
predicted model was improved through energy minimization 
[36] procedure, supported by the Root Mean Square Devi-
ation score 0.612 obtained through the structural superi-
mposition  of  lpxD  models  both  before  and  after  energy 
minimization (Fig. 5B). The refined lpxD protein model is 
publically available in Protein Model Database with PMDB 
ID (PM0080538).

Model evaluation of proposed drug target 

The  correctness  and  quality  of  predicted  lpxD  protein 
model  of  B.  petrii  was  verified  through  RAMPAGE  [37], 
ProSA-web [38], ProQ [39], and ERRAT [40] online server. 
The  RAMPAGE  analysis  revealed  99.5%  residues  were 
folded properly suggesting good backbone folding pattern 

(Fig.  5C).  Further,  Z-score  for  lpxD  model  calculated  by 
ProSA-web to be –6.84 (Fig. 5D) which is well within the 
range  of  native  conformation  of  experimental  structures. 
Furthermore, ProQ computed a Levitt-Gerstein (LG) score 
of 2.785 and Max sub score to be 0.225 for the predicted 
model. A ProQ LG score ＞2.5 is necessary for suggesting a 
model is of good quality [39], implying high accuracy level of 
predicted structure. Also, the overall quality factor for lpxD 
model  of  B.  petrii  was  predicted  as  73.23%  (Fig.  5E)  by 
ERRAT web server. All of these evaluations recommended 
the reliability of the predicted lpxD model of B. petrii.

Molecular docking analysis

The results of molecular docking were intended for ener-
getically  favorable  binding  poses  for  each  nine  natural 
compounds  within  the  active  pocket  (LbH  domain)  of 
proposed drug target of B. petrii (Fig. 5A) as lowest binding 
energy and inhibition constant are generally preferred for 
favorable  binding  mode  while  docking  small  compounds 
with target protein molecule [42, 43]. Again, among them 
isoorientin  (–5.66  kcal/mol),  curcumin  (–5.38  kcal/mol), 
isovitexin (–5.22 kcal/mol) found with lower binding energy 
and inhibition constants i.e., 71.35 μm, 114.67 μm, and 
149.85 μm, suggesting as strong inhibitors of lpxD protein. 
Further, the binding stability was proved through existence 
of  hydrogen  bonding  pattern  between  the  protein-ligand 
complexes (Table 5). Presence of hydrophobic amino acid 

residues within the binding site highly contributes towards 
the stability during molecular interaction between protein 
and small compound. Here, the resulted hydrophobic inte-
raction between the docked complexes also supported for a 
strong binding affinity of natural compounds towards the 
proposed drug target (lpxD) of B. petrii (Table 6, Fig. 7). Also, 
the  presence  of  some  positively  and  negatively  charged 
amino acid residues of lpxD within 4 Å distance from the 
ligands  suggested  for  electrostatic  force  of  interaction 
between docked complexes (Table 6, Fig. 7). Again, among 
nine active natural compounds, isoorientin (–5.66 kcal/mol) 
was  observed  as  the  most  suitable  inhibitor  with  lowest 
binding  energy  and  inhibition  constant  (71.35  μm),  and 
formed hydrogen bond with amino acid residues like Ala 
186, Glu 149, and Gly 227 of lpxD (Table 5, Fig. 7F). Strong 
hydrophobic interactions were seen due to presence of Val

Fig. 7. Interaction profile of nine natural compounds: ajoene (A), allicin (B), cinnamaldehyde (C), curcumin (D), gallotanin (E), isoorientin
(F), isovitexin (G), neral (H), and vitexin (I) with proposed drug target (lpxD protein) of Bordetella petrii. Amino acid residues participated
in hydrogen bonding and interacting within a distance of 4Å in the active pocket of LbH domain of lpxD protein with natural compounds
was  deciphered  here.

165, Ala 186, and Leu 226 within 4 Å distance from the 
ligand  (Table  6,  Fig.  7F).  All  of  these  above  observation 
established isoorientin to be a strong inhibitor against lpxD 
of B. petrii.

In conclusions, Identification of potential drug target has 
a vital role in designing a novel drug against any infectious 
disease.  B.  petrii  strains  have  been  reported  as  causing 
infections in humans and various warm blooded animals. In 
the  present  investigation,  authors  attempted  to  narrow 
down the complete data set of known 5,031 protein seq-
uences of B. petrii DSM 12804 (accession No. PRJNA28135) 
in order to identify a potential drug target computationally. 
In silico study revealed lpxD protein of B. petrii as a potential 
drug  target,  is  an  essential  protein  of  the  pathogen  and 
involved in the biosynthesis of the lipid A component of 
lipopolysaccharide. Again, the observations made through 
computational study also strongly supported lpxD to be a 
potential drug target due to the absence of lpxD protein in 
any  human  essential  pathways  as  well  as  without  any 
significant percentage of sequence homology with human 
and human gut flora micro biota. Again, previous literature 

reports also established the involvement of lpxD in noso-
comial infections caused due to pathogens and hence, could 
be used as a potential drug target [15, 16] against B. petrii. 
Furthermore, due to adverse effect of synthetic drugs, the 
uses of active natural compounds have gained an increasing 
attention towards the treatment or prevention of infectious 
diseases. Moreover, some of the phytochemicals like ajoene 
(garlic), allicin (ginger), cinnamaldehyde (Chinese cinnamon), 
curcumin (turmeric), gallotannin (green tea and red wine), 
isoorientin (blueberry relative found in Central and South 
America), isovitexin (blueberry relative found in Central and 
South America), neral (lemon balm), and vitexin (blueberry 
relative  found  in  Central  and  South  America)  have  been 
reported  as  having  anti-oxidant,  anti-inflammatory,  and 
anti-bacterial  properties,  might  be  used  against  COPD, 
cystic fibrosis, QS biofilm formation, nosocomial infection, 
and  other  types  of  bacterial  infection  [20-25].  Therefore, 
authors  excited  to  apply  molecular  docking  approach  to 
check the inhibitory effects of above mentioned nine natural 
compounds (Table 4, Fig. 6) against the proposed drug target 
(lpxD) of B. petrii. The docking study results also supported 

252

www.genominfo.org

for the confirmation of the mechanism of blocking of lipid A 
biosynthesis in B. petrii which is essential for the survival of 
the bacterium. Again, isoorientin was noticed with highest 
inhibitory effect among nine natural compounds supported 
by lowest binding energy and inhibition constant (Table 5). 
Binding stability was also confirmed through observation of 
strong  hydrophobic,  electrostatic  and  hydrogen  bonding 
interactions  between  protein-ligand  complexes  (Tables  5 
and 6, Fig. 7F). Hence, isoorientin could be suggested as 
most suitable natural compounds against the proposed drug 
target (lpxD) of B. petrii. The overall hypothesis generated 
through  implementation  of  in  silico  approach  would  be  a 
great aid and value towards designing a novel drug against B. 
petrii infection and which would be further validated through 
in vitro experiments.
