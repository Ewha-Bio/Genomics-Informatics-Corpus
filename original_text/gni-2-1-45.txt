introduce.  We  have  chosen 

The  self-splicing  group  I  intron  from  Tetrahymena 
thermophila has  been demonstrated to  perform splicing 
reaction with  its substrate RNA in the  trans configuration. 
In  this  study,  we  explored  the  potential  use  of  the 
trans-splicing group I ribozymes to  replace a specific 
RNA  with  a  new RNA  that  exerts any new function  we 
want 
thymidine 
phosphorylase {TP)  RNA  as  a target  RNA that  is known 
as a  valid  cancer  prognostic factor.  Cancer-specific 
expression of  TP  RNA was first evaluated with  RT -PCR 
analysis of RNA from  patients with  gastric cancer. We 
determined  next  which  regions  of  the  TP  RNA  are 
accessible to ribozymes  by employing an  RNA mapping 
strategy,  and found  that  the leader sequences upstream 
of  the  AUG  start  codon  appeared  to  be  particularly 
accessible.  A specific ribozyme  recognizing the most 
accessible sequence in the TP  RNA with firefly luciferase 
transcript as a 3'  exon was then  developed.  The specific 
trans-splicing ribozyme transferred an  intended 3'  exon 
tag sequence onto the targeted TP transcripts,  resulting 
in a more than  two fold induction of the reporter activity 
in the presence of  TP  RNA in mammalian  cells,  compared 
to the absence of  the target  RNA.  These results suggest 
that  the  Tetrahymena  ribozyme  can  be  a  potent 
anti-cancer  agent  to  modify  TP  RNAs  in  tumors  with 
a  new  RNA  harboring  anti-cancer  activity.

Introduction 
The  self-splicing  group  I  intron  from  Tetrahymena 
thermophila has  been  previously shown  to  trans-splice 
an  exon  attached  to  its  3'  end  onto  a  separate  target 
RNA  not  only  in  test  tube  (Been  and  Cech,  1986)  but 
also  in  E.  cdi (Sullenger  and  Cech,  1994)  and  mammalian 
cells  (Jones  et at.,  1996).  Moreover,  the  trans--splicing 
ribozymes  have  been  demonstrated  to  revise  mutant 
transcripts  associated  with  several  human  genetic  and 
malignant  diseases  (Lan  eta!,  1998;  Phylactou  eta!., 
1998;  Watanabe  and  Sullenger,  2000;  Shin  eta!.,  2002; 
Rogers  et a( 2002)  and  selectively  replace  hepatitis  C 
virus  (HCV)  transcripts  with  a  new  RNA  that  exerts 
anti-HCV activity (Ryu  eta!.,  2003).  These  imply that 
trans--splicing  ribozymes  could  be  potentially  used for 
the  functional  modification  of  any target  RNA  associated 
human  diseases  with  a  new  RNA  encoding  therapeutic 
activity. 

Thymidim~ phosphorylase  (TP),  which  is  identical  to 
the  platelet-derived  endothelial  cell  growth  factor 
(PD-ECGF)  (lltzsch  et at.,  1985;  Furukawa  et at.,  1992), 
is  expressed  at  much  higher  levels  in  a  wide  variety 
of  tumors,  compared  with  adjacent  normal  tissues 
(Luccioni  eta/.,  1994;  Fox  et at.,  1995;  Takebayashi  et 
at.,  1996).  Thus,  TP  is a valid  hallmark of  cancer.  Moreover, 
TP  could  be  an  important  target  for  cancer  therapies 
since  TP  has  angiogenic  activity  in  vivo (Brown  eta/., 
2000),  enhances  tumor  progression,  and  confers 
resistance  to  apoptotic  signal  pathways  (Ikeda  eta!., 
2002  200:3;  Mori  et a!.,  2002). 

He~e.  we  investigated  whether  group  1-based 
ribozymes  could  be  utilized  to  modify TP  RNA  in  cells 
to  express the  intended  sequences  tagged  to  their  3' 
end  by  tar~1eted  trans-splicing.  To  this  effect,  we  first 
confirm  the  expression  pattern  of  TP  RNA  in  cancer 
patients.  We  next  identified  most  accessible  sites  in  TP 
RNA to the  ribozymes  and  constructed  a specific  ribozyme 
recognizin~l the  site.  Moreover,  we  determined  if the 
ribozymes  oould  selectively  induce a  new  reporter  activity 
in  TP-expressing  cells  by targeted  trans-splicing.

reaction,  or cloning  were  purchased  from  Roche  Applied 
Science  or  domestic  suppliers,  sequencing  reagents  from 
PE  Applied  Biosystem.  Argininamide  and  most  of  other 
chemicals  came  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  DMEM  tissue 
culture  media and  fetal  bovine  serum  were  obtained  from 
GIBCO. 

Surgical  specimens  and  RNA  analysis 

Surgical  samples  of  11  paired  normal  and  tumor tissues 
were  collected  from  patients  undergoing  gastric cancer 
surgery at  the  Department  of  Surgery,  Seoul  National 
University  Hospital.  Immediately after  removal,  all  of  the 
tissues  for  molecular analysis  were  put  in  liquid  nitrogen 
and  stored  at  -aoÂ·c  until  use. 

Total  cellular  RNA  was  extracted  from  frozen  tissues 
by using  the  Tri  reagent  (Molecular  Research  Center, 
Inc)  according  to  the  manufacture's  instruction  and  then 
treated  with  DNase  I to  remove  genomic  DNA.  Two  p.g 
of  total  RNA was  reverse  transcribed  into  eDNA with  MMLV 
reverse  transcriptase  and  oligo  (dT)12-1B.  Equal  amounts 
of  eDNA was  subsequently  amplified  by PCR  in  50 .ul 
reaction  volume  containing  1 X  PCR  buffer,  200 .uM  dNTP, 
1.5  mM  MgCI2,  0.2 .uM  of  each  specific  primer  set  and 
2.5  U Taq  DNA  polymerase.  Control  amplification  was 
performed  with  {j-actin.  Amplified  products  were 
electrophoresed  on  1%  agarose  gel. 

Mapping  accessible  sites  on  TP  RNA 

The  mapping  library,  called  GN5  ribozyme  library,  was 
constructed  by randomizing  internal  guide  sequence 
(IGS)  of  the  Tetrahymena group I  intron  so  that the  5' 
end  of  the  ribozyme  in  the  library  began  with 
5'-GNNNNN-3',  where  G represents  guanine  and  N 
represents  equimolar amounts  of  the  four  nucleotides 
(nt),  as  described  (Lan  et at.,  1998).  TP  RNA,  target  RNA, 
was  generated  by  in  vitro transcription  using  T7  RNA 
polymerase  with  a  eDNA  clone  of  TP  (Ishikawa  et at., 
1989,  a  kind  gift from  C.-H.  Heldin,  Ludwig  Institute, 
Sweden).  To  map the  TP  RNA,  50  nM  of  the  GN5  ribozyme 
library was  incubated  at  37"C  for  3  h  under  splicing 
condition  (50  mM  HEPES,  pH  7.0,  150  mM  NaCI,  5  mM 
MgCb)  in  the  presence of  a  guanosine  (100  .uM)  with 
100  nM  of  the  TP  RNA.  The  reaction  products  were 
reverse-transcribed  at  37"C  for  30  min  in  the  presence 
of  argininamide  (10  mM)  with  a  3'  tag  primer  specific 
for 
lacZ  sequence 
(5'-ATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATI -3') (Jones  et at.,  1996). 
cDNAs  were  then  amplified  by PCR  for  35  cycles  using 
the  same  3'  primer  and  a  5'  primer  encompassing  the 
5 end of target TP RNA (5-GCGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTA 
TAGGGCAGTGGACCGCTGTG-3').  The  amplified  fran~ 

ribozyme's  3'  exon 

the 

splicing  products  were  cloned  into  pUC19  vector  and 
sequenced  using  the  dideoxy termination  method  with 
automatic  sequencer  (ABI  310  Genetic  Analyzer). 

Construction  of  specific  ribozymes 
Specific  ribozymes  such  as  Rib73  that  recognize  the 
uridine at  position  73  on  the TP  RNA  were  generated 
by in  vitro transcription  of  DNA templates  which  were 
created  from  pT?L -21  by PCR  with  a 5'  primer containing 
the T7  promoter  and  the  ribozyme's  IGS  and  with  a  3' 
primer  specific  for  the  3'  exon  lacZ sequence.  The  pT71.. -21 
vector  encodes  a slightly shortened  version  of  the  natural 
group  I intron  from  Tetrahymena,  called  L -21  (Sullenger 
and  Cech,  1994).  The  IGS  on  the  L -21  tran~splicing 
ribozyme  (5'-GGAGGG-3')  was  exchanged  with 
5'-GGCCCA  in  Rib73.  In  addition,  inactive  ribozyme, 
R(d)73,  which  is  devoid  of  the  catalytic  core  of  the  enzyme 
(Sullenger  and  Cech,  1994),  was  constructed  as  negative 
controls.  To  construct  enhanced  ribozyme  expression 
vector,  complementary oligonucleotides  containing  an 
extended  P1  plus a 7-nt-long P10  helix and  300  nt-long 
PeR-amplified  sequence  for  the  antisense  region  against 
TP  gene were  inserted  upstream  of  IGS  of  Rib73.  In 
addition,  3'  exon  of  the  modified  Rib73  was  replaced 
with  a eDNA sequence encoding firefly  luciferase gene 
(Flue).  DNA fragment  consisting  of  Rib73  sequence  with 
the  extended  IGS  plus  Flue  ORF  was  inserted  between 
the  EccRl  and  Xba  sites  of  pSEAP  that  encodes alkaline 
phosphatase  under  SV40  promoter  (Ciontech)  to 
generate  Rib73AS-Fiuc. 

Analysis  of  tran~splicing reaction  in  vitro 

For  in  vitro  tran~splicing reaction  assay  of  ribozymes, 
Rib73  (100  nM)  were  incubated  at  37"C  for  3  h  under 
splicing  conditions  with  TP  RNA  (10  nM).  The  resulting 
RNA  was  reverse-transcribed  at  37"C  for  30  min  in  the 
presence of  argininamide (10  mM)  with  a 3'  primer  specific 
for  the  ribozyme's  3'  exon  lacZ sequence as  described 
above.  cDNAs  were  then  amplified  by PCR  for  35  cycles 
with  the  same  3'  primer  and  with  a  5'  primer  specific 
for  the  5'  end  of  TP  RNA.  The  reaction  products were 
analyzed  on  a 3%  agarose  gel.  RT -PCR products  were 
eluted  from  the  gel,  cloned  onto  pUC19  vector,  and  then 
sequenced  with  the  dideoxy  termination  method. 

Luciferase  assay  of  ribozyme  activity  in  cells 
NIH3T3  cells  were  plated  at  3.0  X  105  cells  per  well 
in  35  mm  dishes 24  h prior to transfection.  TP  expression 
vectors,  TP-fl  or TP-orf,  were  generated  by cloning  of 
the  full-length eDNA sequence  or ORF  sequence  of  TP, 
respectively,  into  the  downstream  region  of  CMV  promoter

of  pCDNA  The  cells  were  cotransfected  with  0.1  f-l9  TP-fl 
or 0.1  f-l9  TP-orf along  with  0.1  f-l9  pRLuc  encoding  renillar 
luciferase as  internal  control  and  with  1.8 t-t9  control  vector 
(pSEAP)  or  pRib73AS-Fiuc  using  4 ,ul  lipofectamine 
(GIBCO/BRL).  Cell  lysates  were  harvested  24  h  after 
transfection,  and  reporter  gene  activities  were assessed 
by measuring  relative  light  units  using  a  luminometer 
TD-20/20  (Turner  Designs  Instrument)  and  dual(cid:173)
luciferase  reporter  assay  system  (Promega).  For  fran~ 
splicing  reaction  in  cells,  NIH3T3  cells  were  mock(cid:173)
transfected  or cotransfected  with  0.2 ,ug  TP-fl  with  or 
without  1.8 ,ug  pRib73AS-Fiuc or  pR(d)73AS-Fiuc.  Total 
RNA  was  isolated  from  the  cells  24  h after  transfection 
with  guanidine  isothiocyanate  (Feramisco  eta!.,  1982) 
supplemented  with  20  mM  EDTA.  RNA  (5  t-t9)  was  reverse 
transcribed  with  a  primer  specific  for  the  3'  tagging  Flue 
sequence  in  the  presence  of  10  mM  L -argininamide. 
The  resulting  cDNAs  were  amplified  for  40  cycles  with 
a  5'  primer specific for  the  trans-splicing  junction 
(5' -CCGGAA TTCCCGGGT ACCTGGGCTCGA-3')  and 
with  a  3'-primer specific  for  the  3'  exon  sequence. 

Results  and  Discussion 

TP  expression  pattern  in  gastric  cancer  patients 

We  compared  the  pattern  of  TP  gene  expression  between 
gastric tumor  tissue  and  the  adjacent  non  cancerous 
normal  gastric  mucosa  obtained  from  11  patients  with 
gastric  carcinoma  using  RT-PCR  (Fig.  1).  TP  was 
expressed  at  markedly  higher  levels  in  all  gastric cancer 
tissues  than  the  adjacent  normal  tissues.  Even  though 
much  larger samples  should  be analyzed,  this  indicates 
that  TP  could  be  a candidate  for  a valid  marker  in  gastric 
cancers. 

Trans-splicing strategy of TP  RNA with  group I intron 

In  this  study,  we  tested  if  the  group  1-intron  based 

ribozyme  could  replace  and  modify TP  RNA  with  an 
intended  RNA  with  new  function.  In  the  splicing  reaction, 
the  ribozyme  recognizes  target  TP  RNA  by  base  pairing 
to  any accessible  uridine  nucleotides  of  the  RNA  through 
IGS  of  the  ribozyme.  The  ribozyme  then  cleaves  the  TP 
RNA,  releases  the  downstream  targeted  RNA  sequence, 
replaces  the  sequence with  its  3'  exon,  and  hence  induce 
a  target  RNA-dependent  new gene  activity  (Fig.  2). 

TP  RNA  mapping  for  the  ribozyme-accessible 
nucleotides 
Every  uridine  in  TP  RNA  can  be  potentially targeted  by 
Tetrahymena  group I intron  through  G-U  base  pairing 
between  the  IGS  of  the  ribozyme  and  the  target  RNA. 
However,  only  a limited  number  of  uridines  on  the  target 
RNA  are  likely accessible  to  the  ribozyme  due to  the 
substrate  RNA's  tertiary  structure  and complex  formation 
with  proteins  in  cellular  milieu  (Lan  et al.,  2000).  Thus, 
an  RNA  mapping  strategy was  carried  out  to  determine 
which  uridines  in  the  TP  RNA are  accessible  to  ribozymes. 
The  mapping  method  was  based  on  a  trans-splicing 
ribozyme  library  (Lan  eta/.,  1998,  2000;  Ryu  et at.,  2003) 
and  RNA  tagging  (Jones  eta/.,  1996)  as  described  in 
Materials and  Methods.  Sequence  analyses  of  the  splicing 
junction  sites  showed  that  several  uridines  in  the  leader 
sequence  upstream  of  the  AUG  start  codon  (position 
124  nt),  appeared  to  be  particularly  accessible  (Fig,  3A). 
Especially,  the  uridine at  position  73  (U73)  on  TP  RNA 
was  the  most  frequently  found  as  the  splicing  site.  We 
evaluated  several  different  ribozymes  for  their 
trans-splicing  abilities,  then  Rib73  recognizing  U73  on 
TP  RNA  reacted  with  the target  RNA  with  the  highest 
efficiency  (data  not  shown).  These  observations  strongly 
indicate that  the  relative  tran~splicing efficiency  at  the 
selected  sites  corresponds  with  the  predicted 
accessibility from  the  mapping  analyses  and  encourage 
us  to focus  on  further  developing  and  characterizing 
Rib73.

Expression of new RNA 

Fig.  2.  Scheme  to  ribozyme-mediated  selective  expression  of  new  RNA  by targeted  trans-splicing  of TP  RNA.  TP  RNA  can  be  recognized 
by a  ribozyme  at  any accessible  uridine  residue  by  base  pairing  to  the  sequence  through  its  IGS,  and  then  cleaved.  The  ribozyme  releases 
the  3' cleavage  product  and  replaces  it  with  a  3'  exon  that  encodes  new  RNA  sequence. 

To  determine whether the  specific ribozyme,  Rib73, 
employed  trans-splicing  reaction  on  the  target  TP  RNA, 
the  active  or  inactive  ribozymes  were  incubated  under 
splicing  conditions  with  TP  RNA.  RT -PCR analyses  were 
then showed  that  an  amplified  fragment  of  the  expected 
size  of  102  bp was  generated  from  reaction  mixtures 
with  TP  RNA  and  Rib96  (Fig.  38,  lane 3}.  However,  no 
such  RT -PCR  products were generated  from  either 
sample  with  TP  RNA  alone or Rib73  alone (Fig.  38,  lane 
5 or  6}.  Moreover,  no  RT -PCR products  were  produced 
in  the  reaction  with  inactive  ribozyme,  R(d}73,  and  TP 
RNA  (Fig.  38,  lane 4}.  These  results  suggest that  the 
amplnied  Rf -PCR products in the lane 3 of  Rg.  38 resulted 
from  the  catalytic  activity of  the  specific  ribozyme. 

Sequence  analyses. of the amplified  spliced  products 
were  performed  to  determine  if  the  specific  ribozyme 
could  accurately employ the  trans-splicing  reaction  with 
the target  RNA.  The  sequence of  the  102  bp  RT -PCR 
fragment  demonstrated that  Rib73  had  correctly  reacted 
with  the  TP  RNA  at  the  predicted  reaction  site 
(5'-UGGGCU}  and  replaced  sequences  downstream  of 
the  reaction  sites with  the  3'  exon  sequences  tagged 
at  the 3'  end  of  the  ribozyme  (Rg.  3C}.  Therefore,  it was 
concluded  that  the  specific  ribozyme,  Rib73,  could  replace 
TP  RNA  with  a  3'  exon  attached  to  the  3'  end  of  the 
ribozyme  by targeted  trans-splicing  with  high  fidelity  in 
vitro.

Induction of transgene activity in  TP-expressing cells 
by  the  specific  trans-splicing  ribozyme 

To  determine whether  the  specific  ribozyme  could 
modify the TP  RNA  to  induce an  intended  transgene 
activity  in  cells,  we  first  modified  the  ribozyme  construct 
with  a  functional  active  form  since  group  I ribozymes 
with  only a 6-nt-long  IGS  have  been  very  inactive when 
expressed  in  mammalian  cells  (Byun  eta/.,  2003).  For 
use  in  cells,  we  modified  Rib73  to  contain  an  extension 

of  P1  helix,  addition  of  7-nt-long  P10  helix and  a 
300-nt-long  antisense  sequence  against 
the 
downstream  region  of  U73  of  the  TP  RNA  (Fig.  4A).  These 
modifications  have  been  demonstrated to  increase 
specificity  and  activity of  the  group  I ribozyme  in  cells 
(Kohler  eta/.,  1999).  In  addition,  for  a  transgene  to  be 
readily  expressed  in  mammalian  cells,  a  new start  codon 
AUG  with  Kozak  sequences was  inserted  into the  5'  end 
of  the  3'  exon  transgene  since  the  target  sequence  (U96) 
was  present  in  the  leader  region.  The  expression  vector

(TP-orf).  Luciferase  activity  of  FLue  relative  to  RLuc  was  quantitated,  and  averages  of  three  separate  determinants  are  shown  with  bars 
indicating  standard  deviations.  (C)  RT -PCR analysis  of  trans-spliced  RNA  products  generated  in  cells.  NIH3T3  cells  were  mock-transfected 
(lane  2)  or  transfected  with  TP-11  vector  (lanes  3-5) alone  (lane  5),  with  the  active  ribozyme  (pRib73AS-Fiuc;  lanes  3 and  6),  or with 
the  inactive ribozyme  RNA (pR(d)73AS-Fiuc;  lane  4 and  7).  Trans-spliced  products were  amplified  by  RT -PCR,  yielding  a DNA fragment 
of  350  bp.  The  migration  of  100  bp  ladder  is  shown  as  a  molecular  weight  marker  (lane  1,  MW). 

encoding  the  modified  trans-splicing  ribozyme  with  Flue 
sequence  as  its  3'exon  was  denoted  pRib73AS-Fiuc3. 
For  the functional  analysis  of  the  specific  ribozyme 
in  cells,  we  cotransfected  a  plasmid  encoding  TP  (TP-fl 
or TP-orf) with  pRib73AS-Fiuc  into  NIH3T3  cells  (Fig. 
48).  We  then  assessed  transgene  induction  by monitoring 
luciferase activity of  Flue  relative  to  Rluc  used  for 
normalization.  TP-fl  is  an  expression  plasmid  encoding 

full-length  eDNA of  TP,  thus  containing  the  target  residue 
(U73).  However,  TP-orf  does  not  harbor the target 
sequence since  it  encodes only open  reading  frame 
sequence  of  TP.  Transfection  of  pRib73AS-Fiuc  alone 
(-TP)  showed  a slight expression  of  Rue.  This  nonspecific 
expression  could  be  due to  direct  translation  of  exon 
sequences and/or translation  of  self-splicing  products. 
Further  studies  will  be  needed  to  elucidate the  molecular 

Functional  Modification  of  a  Specific  RNA  with  Targeted  Trans-Splicing  51 

mechanism  of  this  little  nonspecific translation.  In  contrast, 
pRib73AS-Fiuc  efficiently  stimulated  luciferase  activity 
by about  more  than  2-fold  in  cells  cotransfected  with 
TP-fl, compared  to the  cells transfected  with  the  ribozyme 
alone  (Fig.  48).  In  sharp  contrast,  pRib73AS-Fiuc  could 
not  trigger  the  Flue expression  in  cells  cotransfected 
with  TP-orf  (Fig.  4C).  This  could  result  from  the  absence 
of  U73  in  the target  RNA  expressed  from  TP-orf.  Therefore, 
these  results  strongly  indicate that  the  expression  of  the 
transgene  by the  trans-splicing  ribozyme  in  cells  could 
be  highly triggered  with  target  RNA-specific  manner. 
To  determine  whether  the  transgene  induction  in  cells 
with  the  specific  ribozyme  would  be  due  to  the 
trans-splicing  reaction  of  Rib73A8-Fiuc  with  TP  RNA with 
fidelity  in  cells,  we  cotransfected  pRib73AS-Fiuc  with 
TP-fl  in  NIH3T3  cells  (Fig.  4C).  Total  RNA  was  isolated 
from  the transfected  cells  and  analyzed  by  RT -PCR.  A 
trans-spliced  product  of  expected  size  (350  bp)  was 
detected  only  in  cells  cotransfected  with  the  ribozyme 
vector  and  TP-fl  (Fig.  4C,  lane  3).  By  contrast,  no  such 
product  was  generated  in  cells  mock-transfected  or 
transfected  with  the  target  plasmid  alone,  the  ribozyme 
vector  alone,  or the  inactive  ribozyme  alone  (Fig.  4C, 
lanes 2 and  5-7).  Moreover,  no  product  was  also  detected 
in  cells  cotransfected  with  the  inactive  ribozyme  plasmid 
(pR(d)73-Fiuc)  and  TP-fl  (Fig.  4C,  lane  4).  Sequence 
analysis  of  the  amplified  fragment  showed  exact 
trans-splicing  of  the  ribozyme  with  U73  residue  of  the 
TP  RNA  in  cells  (data  not  shown).  Thus,  these  results 
suggested  that  the  specific  group l  ribozyme  was  able 
to  modify the  target  TP  RNA  to  highly  induce transgene 
activity  in  mammalian  cells  with  trans-splicing  reaction. 
In  this study,  we  showed  that  TP  RNA  could  be a 
valid  gastric cancer  marker.  In  addition,  we  developed 
a specific  group  I intron  ribozyme  to  modify such  a specific 
target  RNA associated  with  human  disease to  selectively 
induce transgene  activity  in  cells.  The  3'  exon  can  be 
exchanged  with  any  RNA  sequence  in  the  trans-splicing 
reaction  (Sullenger  and  Cech,  1995).  Thus,  any  new  RNAs 
with  anti-cancer therapeutic activity,  for  example, 
cytotoxin  RNA,  can  be  highly and  selectively  expressed 
in  TP-expressing  cancer  cells,  if  they  are  tagged  at  the 
ribozyme  backbone  containing  IGS  identified  here.  The 
ribozyme  could  then  remove  target  TP  RNA  and 
simultaneously  deliver  cytotoxin  activity selectively  in 
cancer  cells  expressing  the  RNA.  Therefore,  this  RNA 
replacement  may  be  an  attractive approach  for  cancer 
therapy  because  it  should  inhibit  or  reduce  the  production 
of  the  TP  protein  and  simultaneously  engender  the 
production  of  therapeutic  gene  activity  much  higher and 
selectively  in  the  TP-associated  cancer  cells.  Specific 
messages  associated  with  a  wide  range  of  human 

diseases  are  now  being  intensively  identified  through 
the  functional  genomics  and  bioinformatic  studies. 
Together  with  these  advances,  trans-splicing  ribozymes 
that  can  modify  the  disease-associated  unique 
transcripts  would  be  general  tools  for  the  treatment  of 
diverse  human  diseases  such  as  cancer.
