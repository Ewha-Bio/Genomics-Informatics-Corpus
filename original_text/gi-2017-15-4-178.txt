Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a trend in the genomics research area. There are many software 
programs and automated pipelines to analyze NGS data, which can ease the pain for traditional scientists who are not 
familiar with computer programming. However, downstream analyses, such as finding differentially expressed genes or 
visualizing linkage disequilibrium maps and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, still remain a challenge. Here, we 
introduce a dockerized web application written in R using the Shiny platform to visualize pre-analyzed RNA sequencing and 
GWAS data. In addition, we have integrated a genome browser based on the JBrowse platform and an automated inter-
mediate parsing process required for custom track construction, so that users can easily build and navigate their personal 
genome tracks with in-house datasets. This application will help scientists perform series of downstream analyses and obtain 
a more integrative understanding about various types of genomic data by interactively visualizing them with customizable 
options.

Keywords: docker, genome browser, genome-wide association study, RNA sequencing, Shiny, visualization

Introduction

Since its advent, high throughput next-generation sequ-
encing (NGS) technology has revolutionized the genomics 
research area, including transcriptome analysis and genome- 
wide association studies (GWASs) taking advantage of acce-
lerated  sequencing  speed  with  reduced  cost  [1,  2].  Even 
though many bioinformatics software programs have been 
developed to handle and analyze the massive data generated 
from  NGS,  most  of  them  are  based  on  a  command-line 
interface  and  require  quite  a  high  level  of  computational 
power [3], which creates a high barrier for wet lab biologists 
to  enter  into  this  field.  Thanks  to  web-based  analysis 
platforms, including Galaxy [4] and BIOEXPRESS [5], this 
barrier has been lowered. However, there still are problems. 
Downstream analyses, such as finding differentially expre-

ssed genes (DEGs), conducting Gene Ontology (GO) enri-
chment  analysis,  calculating  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD), 
annotating gene information into GWAS results, and finally 
visualizing the resulting data, still require significant com-
puter programming skills. 

In this study, we present a dockerized application, IVAG. 
It provides a user-friendly web interface in which all down-
stream analyses mentioned above can be carried out without 
any programming knowledge. Detailed parameters for each 
analysis  step  can  be  adjusted  with  simple  click-and-drag 
operation.  IVAG  interactively  outputs  publication-quality 
plots in response to the given parameters, and all of these 
plots  can  be  downloaded.  Also,  a  variety  of  data  types, 
ranging  from  RNA  sequencing  (RNA-seq)  and  GWAS 
results  to  sequence  read  alignments,  gene  annotation, 
variant  call  information,  and  peak  information,  can  be 
uploaded  into  the  embedded  genome  browser  and  then

visualized  together  to  help  users  gain  greater  integrative 
insights into their data. Furthermore, IVAG is lightweight, 
allowing it to be deployed on a desktop computer, as well as 
a server application.

Methods

IVAG is mostly written in the R programming language 
[6] and dockerized [7] with all required dependencies to 
avoid compatibility issues. It uses the Shiny package [8] to 
build a user-friendly web interface and several other packages 
to analyze and visualize RNA-seq and GWAS data (Supple-
mentary Table 1). VCFtools [9] and PLINK (v1.90b4.6) [10] 
were used for the LD analysis. The JBrowse platform [11] 
was  integrated  into  IVAG,  and  all  intermediate  steps 
required  for  custom  track  construction  were  automated 
using a custom BASH script. Three publicly available plugins 
(Supplementary  Table  2),  with  slight  modification,  were 
incorporated into the genome browser to build GWAS, GC 
content, and browser extensible data (BED) tracks. Gene 
transfer format (GTF)-to-general feature format 3 (GFF3) 
format  conversion  was  carried  out  with  Cufflinks  (2.2.1) 
[12]. Binary sequence alignment map (BAM) and variant call 
format (VCF) files were sorted with SAMtools [13]. Example 
data were prepared using publicly available RNA-seq and 
GWAS data (Supplementary Table 3).

Results
Workflow

Fig. 1 shows a graphical overview of the pre-analysis steps 
and the IVAG workflow. The blue line (Fig. 1A) denotes a 
schematic representation of the external pipelines required 
for RNA-seq and GWAS data. These parts are prerequisites 
for downstream analyses prior to IVAG analysis. The red box 
in the right panel (Fig. 1B) illustrates the IVAG workflow.

formats are described in Supplementary Figs. 1‒29. 
RNA-seq

IVAG DEG  analysis requires raw count RNA  sequence 
data that can be generated using open source software, such 
as Htseq [14]. DEG analysis outputs a DEG results table 
generated  with  user-specified  parameters  based  on  the  R 
Bioconductor package edgeR [15]. The output table consists 
of multiple columns, such as log2 fold-change, log2 count 
per million, associated p-value, and associated false discovery 
rate  (Fig.  2A),  and  it  can  be  visualized  as  a  heatmap,  a 
volcano plot, and a principal component analysis plot (Fig. 
2B). The heatmap is generated using raw count data, which 
are converted to counts per million and normalized to a have 
row-based percentage value. The volcano plot is generated 
using log2 fold-change  and the  associated false  discovery 
rate. Principal component analysis is generated using the 
raw count of each sample normalized to the log2 count per 
million. The heatmap and volcano plot can be interactively 
updated based on user-specified filtering criteria, such as 
false discovery rate or absolute fold-change. GO enrichment 
analysis uses the DEG analysis results table, GO annotation 
file,  and GTF  file.  The DEG analysis  results table can be 
generated using IVAG DEG analysis, or a pre-analyzed DEG 
analysis  result  can  also  be  used.  The  GO  annotation  file 
consists of two columns: gene ID and GO category. A GTF 
file is needed to generate the gene length of each gene in the 
DEG  analysis  table.  However,  it  can  be  omitted  if  a  user 
wishes not to take gene length bias into account. IVAG GO 
enrichment  analysis  outputs  over-represented  and  under- 
represented GO terms among DEGs (Fig. 2C) using the R 
Bioconductor package goseq [16]. It also shows a histogram 
of  DEGs  in  each  GO  category  based  on  its  ontology: 
biological  process,  cellular  component,  and  molecular 
function.

GWAS

Gene ID annotation requires a tab-separated GWAS result 
file comprising marker ID, chromosome ID, base position, 
and p-value columns in order, and a GTF file that contains 
strand and position information of genes. It returns a new 
GWAS result file in which gene, upstream, and downstream 
columns are added. Both GWAS result files, before and after 

this annotation, can be visualized in Manhattan and quan-
tile-quantile plot with customizable options (Fig. 2D). One 
can see all information for a specific dot of one’s interest if he 
clicks on the interactive plots. The LD analysis part is read in 
a VCF file with several detailed options to generate an LD 
matrix and a marker information file, which can be visualized 
in the LD heatmap (Fig. 2E and 2F).

Genome browser

Constructing a custom genome browser with a reference 
genome sequence is the first step. After selecting one of the 
genome  browsers  configured  in  IVAG,  various  types  of 
genomic data, including GTF, GFF3, BAM, BED, BigWig, and 
VCF, can be uploaded and visualized all together (Fig. 2G). 
Also,  this  genome  browser  receives  RNA-seq  and  GWAS 
results generated from IVAG as inputs.

Discussion

IVAG is an easy-to-use, web-based application with three 
modules, including RNA-seq, GWAS, and a genome browser. 
This application enables scientists with little computational 
proficiency to analyze and visualize their data easily. Some 
web applications provide similar functions for RNA-seq and 
GWAS, but they have some limitations. For example, DEApp 
[17]  provides  differential  expression  analysis  using  three 
different  methods—edgeR,  limma-voom,  and  DESeq2—
while a heatmap or a principal component analysis plot is not 
provided. START [18] can output several plots, but it does 
not  offer  a  GO  enrichment  analysis  function.  LocusTrack 
[19] can visualize GWAS data and annotate multiple tracks 
on  them,  but  it  is  limited  to  only  one  species,  human. 
Zbrowse  [20]  can  be  used  over  every  species.  However, 
because it focuses on plotting multiple GWAS results in one 
panel  to  enable  users  to  detect  genotype-environment 
interactions, the number of markers that can be plotted for 
one trait is limited to 5,000. IVAG is not limited to a specific 
organism or the number of markers [14]. Most importantly, 
IVAG  combines  a  genome  browser  with  analysis  and 
visualization modules so that users can analyze, visualize, 
and  finally  navigate  their  entire  data  interactively  in  one 
application.  We  offer  only  two  analysis  and  visualization 
modules now, but several more modules are in development 
and will be included in the near future.

○C : In order to analyze differentially expressed genes, each genes need at least 6~10 counts. However, 

in raw count table, there  are  lots of genes with 0  counts which need to be filtered out. We use 

count per million to filter out genes with low or no counts. CPM cutoff criteria filters gene out using 

the smallest library size. For example, if the smallest library size was 4,000,000, CPM cutoff 2 would 

filter out genes with less than 8 counts. Number of samples to contain above CPM cutoff criteria 

can  be  specified  as  to  how  many  samples  must  satisfy  above  filtering  criteria.  For  example,  raw 

count table with samples having 3 replicates each, if we specify Number of sample to contain above 

CPM as 3, at least 3 samples must meet the filtering criteria in order to proceed. 

○D : Clicking the Start analysis button will run DEG analysis and produce the results as a table. Users 

can click Download button to get the results as text file format. Visualization button will lead the 

users to a page where they can generate Heatmap, Volcano plot, PCA analysis plot with the DEG 

analysis result. Clicking the GO analysis button will lead to a page where Gene Ontology Enrichment 

analysis can be done.

<Fig. 9. GWAS & LD Upload and Analysis page> 

 

 

○A : GWAS result and LD matrix files (TSV format) can be uploaded. Users can move into plotting 

page by clicking Visualize buttons. Also, uploaded files can be added into pre-built genome browser.     

○B : Users can annotate gene information into all markers in the GWAS result file. 

○C : Choose a VCF file you want to use in the LD analysis. 

○D : Subset the region of your interest by assigning CHR, Start, and END parameters. 

○E : All markers will be pruned using PLINK analysis option “--indep-pairwise” to reduce the number 

of  markers  to  be  used  in  LD  calculation.  Detailed  information  for  this  analysis  can  be  found  at 

http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/summary.shtml#prune. 

<2.2 Manhattan and QQ Plot Visualization > 

<Fig. 10. Manhattan and QQ plot visualization page> 

 

○A : Users can select what type of plot to draw; Interactive or Non-Interactive. 

○B : Adjust specific parameters to customize your plot. You can subset the plot by chromosome and 

highlight the SNPs of your interest.   

○C : Detailed information will be shown when the cursor is hovered over a specific point of interest. 

○D : If you click a specific dot, all information for that dot will be recoded here. 

○E : User can move directly into the genome browser to search the SNP selected at the previous 

step. To use this function, genome browser construction should be done in advance. 

○F : Information of all markers that passed the cutoff will be shown here. 

○G :  QQ  plot  can  also  be  drawn.  Light  blue  shade  indicates  the  confidence  interval  for  the  null 

hypothesis that assumes there is no association between SNP and a trait. 

<2.3 LD heatmap Visualization> 

<Fig. 12. LD heatmap visualization page> 

 

○A : All markers in the LD matrix (uploaded or generated) will be plotted on the upper panel.   

○B : Genomic coordinate map can be added when genomic coordinate information is given. 

○C : The LD heatmap can be subset by uploading a list of markers of your interest 

○D : r2 value for each SNP-SNP pair can be added on the plot. 

<2.4 Input Files >   

GWAS 

<Fig. 13. GWAS_Result.tsv -1 > 

 

1. IVAG intakes GWAS result summary statistics file that comprise Marker ID, Chromosome, 

position, and p-value columns in order. 

<Fig. 13. GWAS_Result.tsv - 2 > 

 

2. Another version of the input file contains additional three columns which could be annotated 

from IVAG Gene ID annotation function. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

LD heatmap -1 

<Fig. 14. LD_Matrix_Rsquare.tsv > 

 

1. LD matrix file is tab-separated and has r2 values for all SNP-SNP pairs in an upper triangular 

matrix form. 

2. The first row (header) is SNPIDs sorted by their position. 

3. The first column, colored in blue, should not be included in the input LD matrix file, but I just 

showed it to help you better understand this format. SNP IDs in column header and row header 

are ordered equally and you can interpret this LD matrix like r2 value between PZA00368.17 and 

PZA03316.3 is 0.025351076 as described in green. 

4. Note that your input file SHOULD look like the red boxed one. 

 

LD heatmap - 2 

<Fig. 15. SNPid.txt > 

 

1. This text file has the list of SNP ids of your interest. You can extract a subset of LD heatmap 

that contains only SNPs specified with this file. 

LD heatmap - 3 

<Fig. 16. SNP_Pos_Info.tsv > 

 

1. genomic coordinate information file requires three columns; SNP, Chromosome, and position.

<Figure 17. Example folder mounted on a docker > 

 

1.  Create DATA directory for mounting docker. 

2.  Create subdirectory raw, json, plink on Data directory. 

- 

- 

raw : Upload file for JBrowse 

json : Information about data uploaded on JBrowse 

-  plink : Save tmp, log files generated from IVAG LD analysis 

3.  Create subdirectory for each species under raw directory and put each data. 

(fasta, bam, gtf, gff3, bed, bw, vcf )   

4.  Specify DATA directory when launching docker image 

 

DATA directory 

C:\Users\USER\Desktop\DATA 

Docker image 

docker run -ti -v C:\Users\USER\Desktop\DATA:/jbrowse/my_data -p 

  launch commend 

8080:80 -p 8383:3838 leetaerim/ivag:v1 /bin/bash -c "Rscript load.R" 

                                                            <Table 1. Example of launching docker image >

<3.8 RNA-Seq & GWAS > 

  IVAG RNA-Seq and GWAS analysis result can be uploaded to IVAG genome browser. Results can 

be uploaded via file but can be omitted by clicking “Add into Genome Browser” button on 

analysis page. 

 

<3.9 RNA-Seq & GWAS – RNA-Seq > 

<Figure 23. JBrowse RNAseq peak track > 

<Figure 24. JBrowse RNAseq peak with logFC track > 

IVAG RNA-Seq analysis result can be uploaded in 3 track types. 

① peak : DEG list is uploaded on JBrowse in bed file format (Figure 23) 

② peak with logFC : Uploaded to JBrowse in BigWig format. (Figure 24) 

 

 

 

③ peak with logCPM : Uploaded to JBrowse in BigWig format. 

 

<Figure 25. RNAseq&GWAS - RNAseq > 

 

○A : Upload DEG analysis result table. 

○B : Specify track type. 

○C : Specify analysis level(gene, transcript ). 

○D : Can specify FDR cutoff for DEG.   

○E : Select genome browser to be uploaded. 

○F : Set track name. 

○G : Genome browser needs gene positions in order to process DEG list. Therefore GTF file needs 

to be specified. 

○H : Create RNA-Seq track. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

<3.10 RNA-Seq & GWAS - GWAS >
