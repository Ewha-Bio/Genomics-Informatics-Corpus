Many biobanks were established as biorepositories for biomedical research, and a number of biobanks were founded in the 
1990s. The main aim of the biobank is to store and to maintain biomaterials for studying chronic disease, identifying risk 
factors of specific diseases, and applying personalized drug therapies. This report provides a review of biobanks, including 
Korean biobanks and an analysis of sample volumes, regulations, policies, and ethical issues of the biobank. Until now, the 
top 6 countries according to the number of large-scale biobanks are the United Kingdom, United States, Sweden, France, the 
Netherlands, and Italy, and there is one major National Biobank of Korea (NBK) and 17 regional biobanks in Korea. Many 
countries  have  regulations  and  guidelines  for  the  biobanks,  and  the  importance  of  good  management  of  biobanks  is 
increasing. Meanwhile, according to a first survey of 456 biobank managers in the United States, biobankers are concerned 
with the underuse of the samples in their repositories, which need to be advertised for researchers. Korea Biobank Network 

(KBN)  project  phase  II  (2013‒2015)  was  also  planned  for  the  promotion  to  use  biospecimens  in  the  KBN.  The  KBN  is 

continuously  introducing  for  researchers  to  use  biospecimens  in  the  biobank.  An  accreditation  process  can  also  be 
introduced for biobanks to harmonize collections and encourage use of biospecimens in the biobanks. KBN is preparing an 
on-line  application  system  for  the  distribution  of  biospecimens  and  a  biobank  accreditation  program  and  is  trying  to 
harmonize the biobanks.

Introduction

Biobanks provide important materials for many research 
realms, such as biomarker development for the early diag-
noses  of  specific  diseases,  including  cancer  and  genetic 
diseases,  and  for  applying  personalized  drug  therapies. 
There  is  no  consensus  definition  for  a  biobank,  but  it  is 
considered a biorepository that stores biospecimens for use 
for diagnostic or research purposes. Also, a biobank is an 
institution that collects, stores, processes, and uses biolo-
gical materials, genetic data, and associated epidemiological 
data from human beings or distributes them to researchers 
[1].  The  term  “research  biobank”  means  a  collection  of 
human biological material and data obtained directly by the 
analysis of this material, which is used or is to be used for 

research purposes [2]. A repository is defined as an organi-
zation,  place,  room,  or  physical  entity  that  may  receive, 
process, store, maintain, and/or distribute specimens, their 
derivatives,  and  their  associated  data.  In  this  paper,  we 
provide a review of biobanks, including Korean biobanks and 
an  analysis  of  sample  volumes,  regulations,  policies,  and 
ethical issues of the biobank.

Biobanks around the World

The  oldest  biobank  for  the  Framingham  Heart  Study 
(FHS), funded by the National Institute of Health-National 
Heart,  Lung,  and  Blood  Institute  (NIH-NHLBI),  collects 
blood samples and data and was established in 1948. The 
purpose of the Framingham program was the development

of case-finding procedures. A total of 5,209 persons between 
the  age  of  30  and  62  from  Framingham,  Massachusetts 
participated in this study, and three generations  of parti-
cipants  (for  a  total  of  almost  15,000  participants)  were 
recruited; the researchers began clinical examinations and 
lifestyle-related  interviews  to  seek  risk  factors  related  to 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) development. FHS has revea-
led  the  significant  identification  of  the  main  CVD  risk 
factors, such as high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, 
smoking, and obesity, as well as immense information on 
factors,  such  as  blood  triglyceride  and  high-density  lipo-
protein cholesterol levels, age, and so on [3].    

By the late 1990s, scientists realized that some diseases 
originated from a single defective gene, but most genetic 
diseases are caused by multiple genetic factors on multiple 
genes  [4].  For  an  understanding  of  whole-genome  infor-
mation of humans, the Human Genome Project (HGP) was 
begun  in  1990,  and  the  human  genome  was  completely 
released in 2003. 

Owing  to  the  increased  demands  on  qualified  biospe-
cimens for research, the number of biobanks has increased 
significantly between 1980 and 1999 worldwide [5]. Many 
countries,  including  the  European  countries,  Japan,  and 
Korea,  have  established  large-scale  biobanks  to  collect  a 
large quantity of patient specimens from over 200,000 peo-
ple,  based  on  their  population  and/or  on  their  disease- 
oriented groups (Table 1). Until now, the top 6 countries, 
according to the number of large-scale biobanks, have been 
the  United  Kingdom  (n  =  15),  United  States  (n  =  14), 
Sweden (n = 12), France (n = 9), the Netherlands (n = 8), 
and Italy (n = 8). Seventy percent of the world’s biobanks are 
located in Europe. Sixty percent of sponsors for biobanks are 
governmental  or  national  institutes,  and  16%  to  17%  of 
biobanks are sponsored by non-profit public service corpo-
rations, universities, and hospitals. The number of biobanks 
is  increasing  recently,  and  particularly,  43  biobanks  were 
launched in the 2000s. Most biobanks (60%) recruited less 
than  100,000  people  and  thirty  percents  of  the  biobanks 
recruited  100,000  to  1,000,000  people.  The  number  of 

Table  1.  Biobanks  with  sample  sizes  ≥ 200,000  (2012)

biobanks collecting blood is 35; 35 collect other biofluids, 43 
collect biomaterials, and 16 secure tissue [6]. 

In 2005, the UK Biobank started collecting DNA samples 
and  personal  information  from  500,000  volunteers  aged 
between  45  and  69  years.  The  main  purpose  of  the  UK 
Biobank  is  to  look  for  the  relationship  between  disease, 
lifestyle, and genes, as well as to identify risk factors that 
affect individual response to specific drug treatment. The UK 
Biobank has collected biospecimens from 500,000 people 
between 2006 and 2010, and they provided their specimens 
to  researchers  starting from March 2012 [7, 8].  In  2008, 
United States researchers stored 270 million specimens in 
biobanks, and the rate of new sample collection is 20 million 
per year [9]. In 2009, Time magazine chose biobanking as 
one of the 10 ideas “changing the world right now” [10]. 
Elger  and  Caplan  [11]  demonstrated  that  the  challenge 
produced by biobanks is immense: after more than 50 years 
of classical health research ethics, regulatory agencies have 
begun to question fundamental ethical milestones. 

A  new  report  by  Visiongain  (http://www.visiongain. 
com), a business information provider based in London, UK, 
predicts  the  world  market  for  biobanking  on  human 
medicine will generate $24.4 bn in 2017 and expand strongly 
to 2023.

In  1995,  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  Science  Tech-
nology established the Korea National Research Resource 
Centers for collecting various bioresources. However, the 
scale and variety of the  collections were  lacking, because 
collections were based on an individual research project. The 
Ministry  of  Environment  established  biobanks,  but  their 
samples were limited to specimens needed for the research 
of environmentally induced diseases. Therefore, there was a 
necessity  to  establish  a  biobank  that  was  centered  on 
hospitals for collecting human biospecimens [12]. 

In 2008, the Ministry of Health and Welfare started the 
Korea  Biobank  Project  (KBP)  and  tried  to  support  esta-
blishing biobanks within university-affiliated general hos-
pitals as well as creating a network among these biobanks, 
including National Biobank of Korea (NBK), which is the

largest national biorepository in Korea, located in Osong, the 
central  region  in  South  Korea  [13,  14].  NBK  provides 
essential biospecimens to scientific researchers by collec-
ting, maintaining, and distributing DNA and serum, plasma, 
and lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL). 

A new building for NBK, the largest in Asia, was con-
structed  in  April,  2012  at  Osong,  Chungcheongbuk-do, 
Korea.  The  three-story  building,  including  storage  rooms 
that can contain 26 million vials of biospecimens, was con-
structed. The structure also has laboratories, an auditorium, 
and so on. The budget for the project was secured from the 
Korean central government in 2008, and the construction 
was  started  in  2010  and  finished  in  2012  [14].  Over  the 
years, many biobanks, including 17 regional biobanks, have 
been established and are moving from a phase of sample 
collection to open their samples for researches. 

Guidelines  for  Management  and  Quality 
Assurance of Biobanks

There  are  many  guidelines  for  the  management  of 
biobanks, such as the International Society for Biological and 
Environmental Repositories (ISBER) guideline and Organi-
zation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
[15] guideline [16]. ISBER is the largest international forum 
that addresses the technical, legal, ethical, and managerial 
issues  relevant  to  repositories  of  biological  and  environ-
mental  specimens. ISBER has the “Best Practices  for  Re-
positories/Collection,  Storage  and  Retrieval  of  Human 
Biological Materials for Research.” Also, ISBER has intro-
duced standard PREanalytical Coding (SPREC) and can be 
used  in  the  biobank  [17].  In  October  2009,  the  OECD 
council adapted a recommendation for Human Biobanks and 
Genetic Research Databases (HBGRDs). The purpose of this 
recommendation suggests guidelines for the establishment, 
management, governance, operation, access, use, and dis-
continuation of HBGRDs, which are structured resources 
that can be used for the purpose of genetic research. The 
OECD  Best  Practice  Guidelines  for  Biological  Resource 
Centers  set  out  further  complementary  quality  assurance 
and technical aspects for the acquisition, maintenance, and 
provision  of  high-quality  biological  materials  in  a  secure 
manner. 

The  standard  operating  protocols  (SOPs),  regulations, 
and management for human biospecimens are important. 
DNA  stability  and  DNA  purity  in  clinical  samples  are 
essential  for  correct  performance  and  interpretation  for 
diagnosis and research. Generally, quality assurance of hu-
man biospecimens consists of a DNA stability test, DNA 
purity test, microorganism contamination test, and cross- 
contamination  test.  All  biospecimens  collected  from  the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

Korea Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) in the case 
of the NBK underwent a DNA degradation test and purity 
test.  Ten  percent  of  biospecimens  stored  in  NBK  were 
randomly chosen and tested for the quality assurance test to 
ensure  the  high  quality  of  DNA  extracted  from  the  bio-
specimens and to check contamination by microorganisms. 
The quality of DNA is important for genetic research, such as 
genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs)  and  whole- 
genome sequencing (WGS). In general, pure preparations of 
DNA  and  RNA  have  an  OD260/OD280  of  1.8  and  2.0 
respectively. LCL quality assurance was also conducted, and 
10% of the stocked LCL was randomly selected to undergo 
survival rate investigation and cross-contamination test in 
the NBK [13].

Bioethics and Safety in Biobanks

Informed consent is getting a patient to sign a written 
consent form and is the process of communication between 
a  patient  and  a  medical  doctor.  In  medical  diagnosis  and 
treatment,  including  invasive  procedures,  a  doctor  or  a 
researcher must give sufficient information to the patient. 
Informed  consent  can  be  given  based  on  a  clear  under-
standing of the process, implications, and consequences of 
an  action.  The  consent  process  should  include  sufficient 
explanation  about  how  individual  information  would  be 
handled [18]. The consent process includes the impact of 
research results on the lives of participants, their families, 
and  their  communities  [19].  Explanations  should  be  on 
confidentiality,  participants’  rights  of  withdrawal,  and 
specifications [20].

Due  to  the  difficulties  of  securing  specific  informed 
consent, broad consent is a more general form of consent in 
which  individuals  agree  to  have  their  biosamples  and 
personal information collected and stored in the biobank and 
for future, unspecified research [21]. Further issues have 
been discussed recently, such as privacy, confidentiality and 
data  protection,  controlling  data  access,  accessibility  to 
biospecimens,  benefit  sharing,  commercialization,  intel-
lectual property rights, and genetic discrimination [22].

In order to ensure bioethics and bioethical safety in the life 
sciences and biotechnologies, each of the institutions should 
set up its own Institutional Review Board (IRB). When a 
genetic testing or research institution obtains written in-
formed consent from a test subject concerning the use of 
specimens  for  research  purposes,  it  may  provide  the 
specimens to either a person conducting research on genes 
or an institution licensed to open a biobank in Korea [1]. 

In  Korea,  the  Bioethics  and  Safety  Act  was  completely 
revised to reinforce research ethics, including biobanks, and 
the law took effect in 2013. The number of biobanks within

university-affiliated  hospitals  will  increase.  This  law  en-
courages  biobanks  to  strengthen  ethical  use  of  biospeci-
mens, and the law assesses biobanks’ responsibility to ob-
tain informed consent from donors and is supervised by the 
IRB. The law also encourages individual researchers to de-
posit  and  use  biospecimens  at  any  biobank  instead  of 
collecting  their  own  sample  collection  and  distribution 
processes [1, 14]. 

Distribution  Policy  for  Biospecimens  and 
Data 

Many  biobanks  have  policies  for  the  distribution  of 
biospecimens and data. For example, there is a guideline to 
distribute  biospecimens  in  the  National  Health  and  Nu-
trition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is a program 
of  studies  designed  to  assess  the  health  and  nutritional 
status of adults and children in the United States. NHANES’s 

biospecimens are representative samples of Americans and 
should not be used for the independent case-control study, 
and  1individual  vial  must  be  stored  permanently.  All 
proposals for the use of NHANES samples are evaluated by 
a technical panel for scientific merit and by the NHANES 
Ethics  Review  Board  (ERB).  To  determine  if  this  limited 
resource should be used in the proposed projects, a technical 
panel will evaluate the public health significance and scien-
tific merit of the proposed research. Distribution of a 0.5-mL 
sample is available once, and after finishing the research, the 
remaining samples are abandoned, or remnants more than 
0.3  mL  should  be  returned  to  NHANES;  third-party  bio-
specimen  transfer  is  not  permitted.  Researchers  who  re-
ceived  specimens  must  submit  the  result  of  the  analysis, 
such as quality control and analytical methods with docu-
ments, to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). 
Surplus data without DNA analysis results would be opened 
in the website and given a period of 3 months for analysis. A

researcher’s intellectual property rights are not permitted 
because  of  research  for  public  health  (http://www/cdc/ 
gov/nchs/nhanes.htm). 

The  Prostate,  Lung,  Colorectal,  and  Ovarian  Cancer 
Screening Trial (PLCO) biorepository in the United States 
has  2.9  million  biological  samples,  including  blood,  and 
researchers can use samples and data through the process of 
peer review. Researchers can submit summarized proposals 
to the PLCO, and the chosen research is recommended for 
full research proposals and submissions are available twice 
in  June/July  or  December/January  annually.  The  review 
process  takes  4  or  6  months.  Researchers  with  approved 
proposals  should  submit  IRB  approval  documents  and 
contract the Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) mutually, 
and biospecimens are distributed to researchers when ap-
proved; researchers should report experimental results to 
Information  Management  Systems  (IMS)  (http://www. 
plcostars.com).

At present, distribution of biospecimens is available to 
Korean researchers irrespective of research funds, and the 
distribution  for  data  is  accessible  to  Korean  researchers 
without  financial  sponsors  in  Korean  biobanks.  All  pro-
posals for distribution of data and biospecimens should be 
reviewed  and  be  approved  by  the  IRB  belonging  to  an 
institute  prior  to  submission.  Opened  data  and  biospe-
cimens for distribution in the NBK are shown in Tables 2 and 
3. First of all, researchers who want to receive the data and 
biospecimens have to submit the application document to 
the NBK. The submitted documents will be reviewed, and a 
board meeting for distribution is held monthly; distribution 
of  work  for  the  approved  application  will  be  performed 
approximately within one or two months from submission 
of  the  application  documents  for  distribution.  NBK  is 
planning a website for the distribution process. 

Most of the distributed biospecimens are DNA samples in 
the NBK, and a few body fluid samples, including sera and 
plasma, were distributed. According to the advancement of 
the technology, the minimum quantity for clinical exami-
nation and for the analysis of metabolites is diminishing. 
However, sera and plasma are very limited resources, and 
political  decisions  and  long-term  planning  for  the  use  of 
body fluid samples will be needed [12]. 

Studies Using Biospecimens of Biobanks 

In  2000, following the HGP, biological research moved 
into the so-called genomic era. Diseases have been studied 
by identifying genes and their specific function and under-
standing the role played by genetics in the beginning and 
prognosis of diseases, and an advanced world of medicine, 
known as “personalized medicine,” has been initiated [5].

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

Accessibility to human specimens and data for the pur-
poses of research is important for realms, such as genomics, 
proteomics, metabolomics, molecular imaging, and nano-
technology [23]. There are genetic factors that affect sus-
ceptibility  to  common  diseases  [24].  These  diseases  may 
have several genetic risk factors that influence each other, 
and interact with the environment, and this has spurred the 
development of large-scale biobanking projects to identify 
susceptible genes [25].

Despite intensive research over the last decade, most of 
the genetic basis of common human diseases remains un-
known. The identification of meaningful genetic variants, 
genes,  and  pathways  involved in  special  diseases  offers  a 
potential route to new therapies, improved diagnosis, and 
better disease prevention. For some time, it has been hoped 
that the advent of GWASs would provide a successful new 
tool for solving the genetic basis of many of these common 
causes of human morbidity and mortality.

Advances  in  sequencing  technology  enabled  us  to  se-
quence the whole human genome [26, 27]. The use of WGS 
of  large  patient  cohorts  is  a  much-needed  approach  in 
researching complex traits; it is still being ruled out to detect 
low-frequency genetic variants, due to its high costs [28, 29].
Among  the  new  and  emerging  fields  of  research  is 
proteomics, the study of the full set of proteins encoded by 
the genome. Also, proteomics is strongly associated with the 
discovery phase, the first step in the process chain to create 
diagnostic content [30]. 

Future  Plans  for  Biobanks,  Including  the 
Korea Biobank Network (KBN)

Due to the increased demands on qualified biospecimens 
for research, the number of biobanks has significantly in-
creased  recently.  By  virtue  of  the  advancements  in  bio-
informatics  and  biotechnology,  storing  biospecimens  and 
data  on  a  large  scale  requires  that  biobanks  harmonize 
biobank processes and regulations [5]. 

Most biobanks did their best to secure more biospecimens 
at the inception of the foundation and comparably distri-
bution rate for the researchers is low. According to a first 
survey of 456 biobank managers in the United States, nearly 
70% of those questioned were concerned with underuse of 
the  samples  in  their  repositories  [31].  Therefore,  many 
biobankers  are  trying  to  advertise  their  biospecimens  to 
researchers in regional academic societies. Like the United 
States,  the  NBK  has  faced  a  similar  situation  for  the 
underuse of biospecimens stored in the biobank. In the first 
phase of the KBP (2008‒2012), biobanks concentrated on 
securing  facilities,  such  as  storage  equipment,  as  well  as 
securing manpower and funding for biobanks. However, in 

www.genominfo.org

215

B  Kang,  et  al.  Current  Status  of  Biobanks

the  second  phase  (2013‒2015),  more  R&D  projects  are 
needed that support clinicians, so that it will be possible to 
gather resources with more information.

For maximizing the value of biospecimens, consistency in 
the methods by which they are retrieved, processed, stored, 
and transported is important. Ideally, this should involve the 
use of agreed SOPs in general [32]. The other issue in the 
next big step is automated biobanking, and today’s biobanks 
demand and move toward automated sample management 
systems that meet the requirements for reliability, sample 
integrity, high capacity, and high throughput.

Horn, the former director of the Genetic Alliance, demon-
strates that biobanks have to cooperate together to achieve 
their mission, and standardization is going to be important 
for researchers to get samples from different collections; we 
need catalogs that say where these samples exist [33]. Ac-
creditation processes can also be introduced to biobanks for 
harmonizing  collections  and  encouraging  use  of  biospe-
cimens in the biobanks, including the KBN. The NBK is also 
preparing an online distribution portal for the convenient 
application of distribution to researchers and preparing a 
biobank  accreditation  program;  these  will  harmonize  the 
biobanks in Korea.
