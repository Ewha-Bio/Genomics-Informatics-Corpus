Metagenomics has become one of the indispensable tools in microbial ecology for the last few decades, and a new revolution 
in metagenomic studies is now about to begin, with the help of recent advances of sequencing techniques. The massive data 
production and substantial cost reduction in next-generation sequencing have led to the rapid growth of metagenomic 
research  both  quantitatively  and  qualitatively.  It  is  evident  that  metagenomics  will  be  a  standard  tool  for  studying  the 
diversity  and  function  of  microbes  in  the  near  future,  as  fingerprinting  methods  did  previously.  As  the  speed  of  data 
accumulation is accelerating, bioinformatic tools and associated databases for handling those datasets have become more 
urgent  and  necessary.  To  facilitate  the  bioinformatics  analysis  of  metagenomic  data,  we  review  some  recent  tools  and 
databases that are used widely in this field and give insights into the current challenges and future of metagenomics from a 
bioinformatics perspective.

Introduction

Metagenomics is defined as the study of the metagenome, 
which is total genomic DNA from environmental samples. 
Metagenomics has long been one of the major research tools 
in microbial ecology since the term was first used in 1998 
[1]. Metagenomic information allows for a more in-depth 
understanding of the ecological role, metabolism, and evo-
lutionary  history  of  microbes  in  a  given  ecosystem  by 
analyzing environmental DNA directly without prior culti-
vation.  Metagenomics  has  made  unprecedented  contribu-
tions to microbial ecology; among them, one of the most 
outstanding discoveries of metagenomics is the first descrip-
tion of proteorhodopsin in marine bacteria [2]. Moreover, 
many hypotheses and questions in ecology and evolutionary 
biology  have  been  tested  and  answered  through  metage-
nomic research. For example, Fuhrman et al. [3] tested a 
latitudinal gradient of biodiversity, which is one of the most 
widely recognized patterns in macroscopic taxa, on marine 
bacteria, and more recently, the taxonomic and functional 

distinction of bacteria in desert compared to other nondesert 
biomes was investigated through cross biome comparison 
using  shotgun  metagenomics  [4].  Varied  definitions  con-
verge into two main categories, targeted metagenomics and 
shotgun  metagenomics,  depending  on  their  purpose  and 
target materials. This review offers an overview of the tools 
and  databases  that  are  widely  used  in  both  targeted  and 
shotgun metagenomics, in particular emphasizing on meta-
genome  sequences  generated  by  recent  next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) technologies.

A  Revolution  of  Sequencing  Technologies 
and Current Challenges in Bioinformatics

The recent development of sequencing technologies has 
enabled us to assess much deeper layers of microbial com-
munities  by  generating  tons  of  nucleotide  sequences  at 
lower costs. NGS technologies have revolutionized the field 
of  microbial  ecology,  as  they  have  allowed  researchers  to 
reach the true level of diversity more closely through more

in-depth sequencing. There are various applications using 
these  NGS  platforms,  ranging  from  single-gene  targeted 
sequencing  to  whole-genome  sequencing  and  shotgun 
metagenome sequencing. Details about the principles and 
applications  of  each  NGS  technique  have  already  been 
reviewed  elsewhere  [5].  The  first  NGS  platform,  pyrose-
quencer (GS20), generated just 20 Mb per run with a read 
length of 100 bp on average. A recent version of pyrose-
quencer  (GS-FLX  Titanium)  has  an  advantage  over  other 
NGS techniques, especially 16S rRNA gene-based surveys, 
as it produces around ∼500 Mb per run with a longer read 
length  (400‒500  bp),  which  is  sufficient  to  cover  partial 
hypervariable  regions  of  16S  rRNA.  Illumina  sequencing 
produces many more reads with cheaper price that are more 
accurate (accuracy of >99%) than 454 platforms (accuracy of 
98.93%) [6] but is somewhat limited in certain fields due to 
the  relatively  shorter  read  length  (<100  bp)  of  early 
versions. However, Illumina became more popular, since it 
gradually  improved  readable  lengths  (i.e.,  2  ×  250  bp  in 
MiSeq).  More  recently,  Pacific  Biosciences  has  released  a 
new sequencing technology, PacBio RS, and Oxford Nano-
pore  Technologies  introduced  GridION/MinION  devices, 
both  of  which  allow  single-molecule  sequencing  with  a 
much longer read length. However, further improvements 
are necessary for use in practice due to the high intrinsic errors 
(10% to 15% in PacBio and around 4% in GridION) [7].

Since the first launch of the NGS platform in 2006, novel 
sequencing technologies have been developed continuously 
and rapidly. As a result, massive sequence data produced by 
NGS technologies are accumulating at an unflagging rate. 
However,  the  computing  power  and  development  of 
algorithms needed to deal with the huge datasets efficiently 
are not keeping up with the speed of data production. For 
example, access to sequence data is still hampered by un-
suitable  data  storage  systems,  such  as  short  read  archive 
(SRA), and many early papers were not accompanied by data 
deposition into public databases. Repositories should be big 
enough  to  be  ready  to  allow  the  increasing  volume  of 
upcoming sequence data, and all data must be deposited in a 
standardized  manner.  In  addition  to  the  shortage  of  data 
storage  space  and  confounding  submission  formats,  the 
characteristics of the produced sequence data pose another 
problem  in  further  processing.  For  instance,  shorter  read 
length,  which  is  an  inevitable  limit  of  high-throughput 
sequencing,  is  a  barrier  for  sequence  assembly,  and  the 
relatively higher rates of sequencing errors compared with 
previous  Sanger  methods  also  make  it  hard  to  recover 
genuine sequences.

Targeted Metagenomics

Targeted metagenomics refers to a metagenomic approach 
that surveys genes or genomic regions of particular interest 
by targeted methods (activity- and sequence-driven studies) 
[8].  Sequence-driven  targeted  metagenomics  is  normally 
conducted  by  PCR-based  directed  sequencing  of  environ-
mental genomic DNA. Ribosomal RNA genes (e.g., small 
subunit [SSU] and large subunit [LSU]) have been used as 
taxonomic marker genes for identifying microbial species. 
The  characteristics  of  having  both  highly  conserved  and 
variable regions have allowed for accurate taxonomic iden-
tification and made it easier to design primers targeting the 
whole taxa of interest. Although taxonomic resolution of the 
16S rRNA gene is not sufficient for delineating taxa at the 
species or strain level in some cases [9], the SSU of ribo-
somal RNA (16S rRNA) has been used widely as a standard 
marker  gene  in  prokaryotes.  For  the  last  few  decades, 
molecular methods to assess microbial diversity have focu-
sed on rRNA genes using probe-based approaches, such as 
fluorescent  in  situ  hybridization  and  microarray,  finger-
printing methods, and molecular cloning. Some of them are 
still in use, but in this review, we focus mainly on sequence 
data generated by recent NGS techniques. 

Microbial community profiling using taxonomic marker 
genes (e.g., 16S rRNA gene) commonly uses an operational 
taxonomic  unit  (OTU)-based  approach,  as  the  sequence- 
based species definition in microbes is still vague and current 
public databases still do not reach the full extent of microbial 
diversity, despite the massive sequencing efforts. This OTU- 
based approach is now generally accepted in most microbial 
community studies based on environmental samples. Over 
the last few years, 454 pyrosequencing has  been a major 
source of generating amplicon metagenomics data among 
NGS platforms due to its capability of producing a relatively 
longer read length. Therefore, bioinformatic analysis tools 
dealing with sequence data have been developed and tailored 
for pyrosequencing results. More detailed information about 
the algorithms and processes at each step can be found in 
several  other  reviews  [7,  10].  In  this  part,  we  introduce 
recent tools and databases and provide brief explanations 
about how they work in the course of the analysis workflow 
(Table 1) [11-29].

Denoising

The first part of an analysis of NGS-generated data starts 
from  filtering  out  ‘noise’  sequences.  Most  metagenomic 
studies based on single- or multiple-gene amplicons have 
used 454 pyrosequencing due to its advantage of producing 
longer read lengths, and currently available denoising algo-

rithms  have  also  been  developed  for  that  purpose.  The 
denoising process per se does not remove actual sequences 
but keeps abundant information on erroneous sequences by 
retaining representative reads. Several denoising algorithms 
have been suggested so far. PyroNoise [11] implements a 
flowgram  clustering  method,  and  other  denoising  tools, 
such as Denoiser [12], DADA [13], and Acacia [14], use 
sequence abundance information on the denoising process. 
Similarly,  single-linkage  preclustering  can  be  used  before 
performing  the  formal  OTU  clustering  to  reduce  ‘noise’ 
sequences generated by PCR and sequencing errors [30]. It 
first ranks sequences in order of decreasing abundance, and 
rarer sequences within a certain threshold are merged into 
the original abundant sequences.

Chimera Detection

Once denoising and additional quality control processes 
are completed, chimeric sequences should be removed from 
the dataset. Chimeras are artificial recombinants between 
two  or  more  parental  sequences,  and  they  are  normally 
formed when prematurely terminated fragments reanneal to 
other template DNA during PCR amplification [31]. These 
artificial  molecules  make  it  difficult  to  differentiate  the 
original  sequence  from  recombinants,  resulting  in  over-
estimation  of  the  level  of  microbial  diversity  in  environ-
mental  samples  [32].  Once  chimeras  are  generated  and 
sequenced, they need to be identified and removed from the 
dataset  using  bioinformatics  tools.  However,  detecting 

chimeras is still challenging, as breakpoints can take place at 
any position more than once, and NGS platforms generate 
shorter lengths of sequences, making them hard to diffe-
rentiate the source of parents with insufficient taxonomic 
information. Several elegant algorithms and tools have been 
suggested for preferentially identifying chimeric sequences 
in high-throughput datasets. These tools include UCHIME 
[15], ChimeraSlayer [16], Perseus [11], and Decipher [17]. 
All of these tools, except for ChimeraSlayer, use sequence 
frequency  information  to  detect  chimeras,  assuming  that 
chimeric sequences are less frequently represented in a given 
dataset  than  normally  amplified  sequences.  There  is  no 
algorithm to detect chimeras perfectly, but to date, it has 
been known that UCHIME outperforms other algorithms, at 
least  for  short  NGS  reads  [15].  Although  there  are  still 
several limitations in detecting chimeric sequences that are 
formed by hybridization between closely related organisms, 
the  tools  listed  above  work  well  on  SSUs  and  LSUs,  but 
further  validations  are  necessary  for  internal  transcribed 
spacers and other functional genes.

OTU Clustering

The next step following chimera detection is OTU clus-
tering, which is an essential process in community analysis, 
as it sorts sequences with the closest matches and then gives 
a taxonomic meaning to the clustered group. Sequencing 
errors,  chimeras,  and  clustering  algorithms  have  great 
influence on the quality of OTUs [33]. There are generally 

104

two ways that have been suggested for generating OTUs. 
One  is  alignment-based  clustering,  and  the  other  is  the 
alignment-free  clustering  method.  Sequence  alignment  is 
done by either aligning query sequences against pre-aligned 
reference  sequences  [34]  or  using  pairwise  and  multiple 
sequence alignments [35]. It is known that alignment qua-
lity has a significant impact on OTU clustering results [36]. 
Alignment quality varies, depending on gene loci and the 
parameters  used,  but  sequence  alignment  incorporating 
secondary  structure  information  generally  improves  OTU 
assignment, at least for 16S rRNA gene sequences [37]. The 
nearest alignment space termination (NAST) algorithm [34] 
has been used successfully in microbial ecology as a profile- 
based  alignment  tool,  and  SINA  aligner  [38],  based  on 
partial order alignment, and infernal [39], using consensus 
RNA secondary structure profiles, were recently introduced. 
However, there  is  currently no  method or  algorithm  that 
does  automatic  alignment  almost  perfectly  or  up  to  the 
quality that can be achieved manually. Alternatively, align-
ment-free methods are more broadly used in picking OTUs. 
Commonly  used  alignment-free  tools  are  UCLUST  [18], 
CD-HIT [19], and ESPRIT-Tree [20]. UCLUST and CD-HIT 
implemented their own sorting processes in OTU clustering 
by sorting sequences in order of decreasing abundance (i.e., 
UCLUST) or decreasing length (i.e., CD-HIT), and ESPRIT- 
Tree uses an average linkage-based hierarchical clustering 
algorithm.  There  are  some  other  tools  that  implement  a 
‘homopolymer collapse option’ for minimizing homopoly-
mer  errors  in  454  reads:  CLOTU  [40],  SCATA  (http:// 
scata.mykopat.slu.se), CrunchCluster [41], and TBC [21]. 
However, these tools are currently applicable only to 454 
reads, and there is a fundamental limitation of not being able 
to  detect  ‘real’  sequence  differences  appearing  in  homo-
polymer regions. SCATA has suggested another OTU pic-
king approach by using both reference sequences and query 
sequences together in the clustering process, and then the 
OTU is assigned to a taxonomic identity of the reference 
sequence if the reference sequence belongs to the cluster.

A taxonomy-dependent approach was recently proposed 
as an alternative to OTU clustering approaches [42]. This 
method  has  two  major  advantages  over  OTU  clustering. 
First, direct taxonomic assignment to each query sequence is 
more tolerant to sequencing errors than the OTU picking 
process, as the assignment process is less affected by mis-
matches  or  insertion/deletion  errors,  while  sequencing 
errors are known to generate many spurious OTUs. It also 
helps  prevent  a  massive  loss  of  erroneous  but  still  taxo-
nomically meaningful sequences. Second, it enables resear-
chers to perform a more standardized community analysis, 
based on a single assignment rule. There is no truly ‘uni-
versal’ primer set, and the difference in primer sets makes it 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  3,  2013

difficult to compare datasets, as the different primer sets 
amplify differing variable regions within 16S rRNA genes 
and catch only a partial body of the whole ‘true’ community. 
On  the  other  hand,  a  taxonomy-supervised  method  can 
circumvent the problem by directly assigning sequences to 
the closest relatives using full-length reference sequences. 
This approach also facilitates cross-comparison and meta- 
analysis  across  versatile  microbial  community  studies.  A 
caveat  is  the  low  taxa  coverage  of  current  marker  gene 
databases, which offsets the advantage of this approach and 
hinders  the  application  in  practice  by  failing  to  find  the 
closest matches to known members, due primarily to its lack 
of close relatives in a given database. Another limitation is 
the relatively lower assignment accuracy and precision of 
short NGS reads compared to those of full-length sequences. 
It is generally known that even longer 454 Titanium reads are 
able to be identifiable with high confidence scores at best to 
the genus level [43], even genus-level classification is doub-
ted [44]. However, this problem will be soon overcome as 
more high-quality sequences are added to the databases. For 
example, EzTaxon-e benefits from using artificially defined 
species names, which are defined based on combinatorial 
evaluation  using  both  phylogeny  and  pairwise  similarity 
between unclassified sequences on all taxonomic levels. It 
endows  taxonomically  more  meaningful  information  to 
those  ‘unclassified’  sequences  rather  than  remaining  un-
known or environmental sequences. Moreover, recent up-
dates  have  slightly  improved  the  database  coverage  by 
adding error-free 454 reads that are selected using abun-
dance information (http://eztaxon-e.ezbiocloud.net/).

16S Databases and Taxonomic Classification

Identifying each individual sequence is of great impor-
tance in microbial community analysis, as taxonomic infor-
mation gives us access to basic information of its traits, such 
as physiology, epidemiology, and evolutionary history, and it 
allows for indirect inference  of  their ecological roles in a 
given  environment.  There  are  several  methods  that  have 
been  suggested  for  assigning  microbial  taxonomy  with 
high-throughput sequence data. BLAST [45] is one of the 
most widely used algorithms when classifying sequences. 
The top BLAST hits by searching against reference databases 
are  generally  used  for  taxonomic  identification  of  query 
sequences. There are several well-curated public SSU data-
bases, such as RDP [22], SILVA [23], Greengenes [24], and 
EzTaxon-e [25]. However, the top BLAST hit does not always 
give the correct taxonomy result, especially in shorter reads. 
Alternatively,  Greengenes  and  EzTaxon-e  use  BLAST  in 
conjunction with global alignment, and the post processing 
of a BLAST-aligned output has been suggested to improve

assignment  accuracy  using  the  lowest  common  ancestor 
(LCA) algorithm in MEGAN [46] and the optimal consensus 
method  (F-measure)  in  TANGO  [47].  The  probabilistic 
approach also gives a similar level of accuracy but is much 
faster than a BLAST search. The naïve Bayesian algorithm 
[48], implemented in RDP, uses 8-mer word-matching for 
training  datasets  and  provides  assignment  results  with 
bootstrapped confidence estimates. Phylogenetic placement 
method is a recently suggested approach that places query 
sequences  into  a  phylogenetic  guide  tree  on  the  basis  of 
various evolutionary models. This approach is particularly 
useful in a case where there are no close relatives to the query 
sequence in databases, due primarily to the low DB coverage, 
which  is  the  case  with  microbial  eukaryotes.  Tools  using 
phylogenetic methods in taxonomic assignment include the 
evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA) [49], pplacer [50], 
and SEPP [51], and these algorithms were recently incor-
porated into QIIME [28] and AMPHORA2 [52].

Shotgun Metagenomics

Until the arrival of NGS technologies in this field in 2006, 
shotgun  libraries  had  been  constructed  using  circular 
vectors, each of which had an insert derived from a meta-
genomic DNA fragment [53]. Sequencing strategies desig-
ned  either  to  completely  assemble  the  sequence  of  each 
long-insert  vector  (tens  to  thousands  of  kilobases)  or  to 

generate a paired-end read from small inserts (around 1‒2 
kilobases) were applied to those vector libraries. The former 
strategy has a unique strength, in that it is relatively easy to 
generate contigs orders of magnitude longer than the read 
length  when  assembling  the  reads  from  homogeneous 
templates [2]. However, such a strategy is not scalable to 
analyze a large number of clones, as the tremendous amount 
of reads per clone needs to be screened. The latter strategy, 
a genuine random shotgun approach, took essentially the 
same approach with the NGS-based metagenome assembly, 
which  enables  analysis  of  a  large  number  of  clones  but 
requires high coverage in order to be successful [54, 55]. 
Regardless  of  the  strategies  taken,  vector  library  con-
struction and subsequent sequencing are time-consuming 
and cost-ineffective, and only a few organizations can lead 
such efforts. 

NGS  technologies  have  proven  their  utility  in  shotgun 
metagenomics since their earliest application appeared in 
2006 with studies using 454 pyrosequencing data. After all, 
technologies like 454 and Illumina sequencing have become 
routinely applied for shotgun metagenomics, accompanying 
changes in the trends of the field as well as the properties of 
the data themselves. As sequencing cost continues to de-
crease, more researchers outside the big sequencing centers 
have started to participate in metagenomic studies, resulting 
in higher individuality and diversity of metagenome data. 
Bioinformatics  for  metagenome  analysis  has  progressed,

along with the explosion of data, both by extension from the 
tools and databases previously developed in genomics and 
the adoption of methodologies used by ecologists. Less than 
a decade has passed since metagenomic shotgun sequencing 
took its place as general practice for biologists, and it is fair 
to say that bioinformatics for shotgun metagenomics is at a 
premature stage. In this section, we aim to summarize the 
methods that seem to be the ‘current’ standard, the most 
widely used, in the analysis of shotgun metagenomic data 
(Fig. 1).

Assembly

Assembly  is  the  process  of  merging  overlapped  short 
reads into larger contiguous sequences (contigs). Current 
sequencing technologies normally break genomic DNA into 
pieces, and original genomic sequences need to be recovered 
from fragmented reads by an assembly process. In metage-
nomics for retrieving coding regions, it is necessary to make 
it easier to do functional annotations, as a more accurate 
classification/annotation  is  possible  in  longer  sequence 
information. Most assemblers have been developed for the 
single  genome  or  clonal  populations  with  high  coverage. 
There are currently few metagenomic assemblers, as meta-
genomic reads are more complex, owing to nonclonal hete-
rogeneous  reads  resulting  from  multiple  strains  differing 
only by partial regions or rearrangements, lower or uneven 
coverage  across genomes, sharing  of  repetitive sequences 
among  closely  related  species,  and  lateral  gene  transfer 
sharing similar entities between distantly related organisms. 
At an early stage of metagenomic studies, reference map-
ping approaches (e.g., Newbler, AMOS, MIRA) were applied 
to the metagenome assembly process. However, with the 
low coverage and complexity of megenomic reads, de novo 
assemblers were preferred to reference mapping, based on 
the advantage of feasibility for dealing with the aforemen-
tioned problems. Starting from initial assemblers, such as 
SOAPdenovo [56], there are now several improved assem-
blers  available:  are  Genovo  [57],  Meta-IDBA  [58],  Meta-
Velvet [59], MAP [60], and Ray Meta [61]. Metagenome- 
specialized  assemblers  have  to  distinguish  reads  from 
different  species.  MetaVelvet  and  Meta-IDBA  resolve this 
issue by partitioning the de brujin graph based on k-mer 
coverage and separately assemble each subgraph. Ray Meta 
does not decompose the de brujin graph; instead, it uses a 
heuristics-guided  graph  traversal  approach  to  find  the 
optimal assembly. Meta-IDBA, MetaVelvet, and Ray Meta 
were developed to perform well on short reads (e.g., Illumina 
sequencing). On the other hand, other tools, like Genovo 
and  MAP,  were  developed  for  longer  reads  (e.g.,  454  se-
quencing). The outputs from various assemblers can be used 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  3,  2013

to generate scaffolds using Bambus2 by avoiding misjoins 
between  distantly  related  organisms  by  detecting  repeats 
and genomic variants [62].

Binning and Taxonomic Classification

Taxonomic classification of reads, which is called binning, 
is the most basic step in the characterization of microbial 
communities by metagenome sequencing. However, taxono-
mic binning of metagenome shotgun sequences is a chal-
lenging task for researchers, especially when working with 
short reads derived from NGS. There are several reasons that 
make binning a nontrivial job. 

One of the  reasons is that NGS  technologies generally 
produce short reads. When applying shotgun sequencing to 
complex  microbial  communities  found  in  soil,  seawater, 
freshwater,  and  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  the  sequencing 
coverage  does  not  reach  the  level  required  to  make  the 
assembly practically useful, even by current deep sequencing 
methods. The majority of reads remains unassembled. As a 
result, the majority of reads is taxonomically classified by the 
information in their short length. Short length presents a 
number of drawbacks in binning. Homology search-based 
methods  suffer  from  a  lack  of  alignment  confidence  and 
difficulties  in  predicting  protein  sequences  from  partial 
genes. Phylogenetic methods suffer from a lack of resolution 
due to insufficient phylogenetic information. Another chal-
lenge is the size of data that have to be processed during the 
binning  process.  Data  size  here  refers  to  both  the  reads 
obtained  from  metagenomes  and  the  sequences  in  the 
reference database. The novelty of microbes in the environ-
mental  samples  also  hampers  binning,  as  they  are  not 
represented by any sequence in the reference database. One 
last  challenging  thing  for  researchers  is  the  diversity  of 
binning tools. There are dozens of choices, differing in both 
logical and practical aspects. 

A straightforward approach for taxonomic classification 
of  metagenome  shotgun  reads  is  searching  for  a  similar 
sequence in a collection of known sequences that carries the 
taxonomic identity of each sequence. Similarity-based me-
thods  vary in at  least three dimensions.  1) Choice  of  re-
ference database: the search space could be restricted to a 
particular marker gene (e.g., SSU rRNA for prokaryotes) or 
a small number of selected protein families or could be as 
general as the entire NCBI nr database. 2) Search algorithm: 
from  BLASTN  (in  case  of  using  rRNA  gene  marker), 
BLASTX (protein database), and BLASTP (protein database 
after gene prediction) to a hidden Markov model (HMM)- 
based homology search (searching for protein families). 3) 
Taxonomic  assignment  from  the  hit  information:  from 
simply transferring the identity of the best hit to the use of

LCA,  modified  LCA,  or  more  complicated  phylogenetic 
inferences. Among the popularly used tools, MEGAN uses 
the NCBI nr database for searching and LCA algorithms for 
assignment [29]. MTR and SOrt-ITEMS modified MEGAN’s 
LCA algorithm by use of taxonomic information shared by 
hits  (MTR)  or  by  performing  a  reciprocal  BLAST  hit  to 
reduce false positive hits (SOrt-ITEMS) [63, 64]. MG-RAST 
exploits  both  rRNA  gene  sequences  and  protein-coding 
sequences [65]. For the rRNA gene sequences, MG-RAST 
follows  the  RDP  pipeline  [22],  while  for  protein-coding 
genes, it first predicts the protein coding sequences and then 
performs a BLASTX search against a number of databases, 
including SEED [66], and extracts taxonomic information 
from SEED hits. CARMA uses an algorithm similar to LCA 
and offers two ways for searching the database of known 
protein  sequences:  the  NCBI  nr  database  searched  by 
BLASTX and the Pfam database searched by HMMER3 [67]. 
MetaPhyler is a power-up version of AMPHORA and uses 31 
marker genes to reduce the search space [68, 69]. 

Composition-based classification of DNA sequences has 
been proven to be very useful, although it does not appear as 
intuitive  as similarity-based  methods.  Composition-based 
methods exploit the uniqueness of base composition (from 
single to oligonucleotide levels) found across the genomes of 
different taxonomic entities. In many cases, these methods 
implement machine-learning algorithms. Ultimately, all of 
these methods use the taxonomic information of the refe-
rence database to assign a taxonomic identity to the reads. 
However,  they  can  be  divided  into  supervised  and  unsu-
pervised  methods,  based  on  their  dependence  on  the  re-
ference training  set  during  the  initial  learning  procedure. 
The  most  popular  tools  using  supervised  learning  are 
PhyloPythia, NBC, and Phymm. Starting from the publicly 
available microbial genome sequences, NBC trains a naïve 
Bayes classifier based on the N-mer frequency profiles of 
each genome [70], Phymm builds an interpolated Markov 
Model using variable-length oligonucleotides typically found 
in taxa [71], and PhyloPythia trains a support vector ma-
chine  classifier  based  on  variable-length  oligonucleotide 
composition [72]. Among the above, NBC and Phymm are 
suitable  for  classifying  short  reads  generated  from  NGS 
sequencers.  The  popular  tools  employing  unsupervised 
learning  are  TACOA  and  TaxSOM.  TACOA  introduced  a 
kernelized k-nearest neighbor approach to cluster the reads 
[73],  while  TaxSOM  uses  batch-learning  self-organizing 
maps (BLSOMs) and growing SOMs (GSOMs) to generate 
the clusters of related reads [74]. Both TaxSOM and TACOA 
are not suitable for unassembled short NGS reads.

There are tools that combine composition-based approa-
ches  and  similarity-based  approaches  together  to  gain 
accuracy and discard fewer reads. PhymmBL linearly com-

bines the BLASTN score and Phymm score and thereby gains 
more  power  to  discriminate  between  similar  BLAST  hits 
[71].  RITA  also  combines  a  BLAST  search  with  a  com-
position- based NBC; however, unlike PhymmBL, RITA puts 
more weight on the BLAST result [75]. Both approaches are 
reported to perform well, even with short reads, but as they 
involve a BLAST search, they consume much time. There is 
a third type of taxonomic binning method recently imple-
mented  in  the  tool  MetaPhlAn,  which uses  clade-specific 
marker genes [76]. From the database of microbial genomes, 
MetaPhlAn  precalculated  400,141  genes  that  are  most 
representative of each taxonomic unit. In theory, detection of 
the reads that match these markers can classify the members 
at the species level. MetaPhlAn uses BLASTN search to com-
pare the reads against the set of marker genes. As the search 
space is markedly reduced from general sequence databases 
used  in  other  approaches,  MetaPhlAn  exhibits  unusually 
high speed.

Functional  Annotation  and  Metabolic  Re-
Construction

Functional assignments and pathway reconstructions are 
ultimate  steps  of  shotgun  metagenomics  that  allow  the 
characterization of the functional potential of uncultivated 
microbes  or  microbial  communities  under  investigation. 
Connecting the sequences of metagenomic data to specific 
functions in the environments can be performed by using 
web-based  workflows  offered  by  useful  portals  without 
access to high-performance computers. These online meta-
genome annotation services, like IMG/M [77], METAREP 
[78], CAMERA [79], and MG-RAST [80], provide platforms 
for  gene  prediction,  assignment  of  functional  categories, 
protein families and gene ontologies, and inference of pro-
tein interactions and metabolic pathways represented in the 
metagenomic data (Table 2). While an installable workflow 
like MEGAN4 [29] also exists, MEGAN4 does not provide 
gene predictions or homology-based or profile-based anno-
tation analyses. Instead, the pipeline uses ready-made anno-
tation data derived from BLASTX or BLASTP against the 
NCBI nr database. 

Gene finding or gene prediction is a fundamental step for 
annotation. Classical gene finders that have been developed 
for a single genome are unsuitable for metagenomic analysis, 
because metagenome data are made up of a mixture of se-
quences from different organisms and often comprise mainly 
short assemblies and unassembled reads. Moreover, the high 
error rate of NGS can lead to frameshifts and make gene 
prediction more difficult. For this reason, several dedicated 
gene prediction programs have been developed, like Meta-
Gene [81], MetaGeneAnnotator [82], Orphelia [83], Frag-

GeneScan  [84],  Glimmer-MG  [85],  and  MetaGenemark 
[86]. These programs incorporate different models for gene 
prediction, such as machine learning algorithms [87], HMMs 
[88], and di-codon usages [89]. MetaGeneMark (GeneMark) 
uses codon usage-incorporated HMM; Prodigal incorporates 
a machine learning algorithm [90]; MetaGene incorporates 
di-codon usage [91]; FragGeneScan uses a sequencing error 
model  and  codon  usage-incorporated  HMM;  MetaGene-
Annotator uses a machine learning algorithm and di-codon 
usage  information;  Glimmer-MG  uses  an  interpolated 
Markov  model  [92];  and  Orphelia  uses  a  codon  usage- 
incorporated machine learning algorithm.

Functional  analysis  of  metagenome  generally  uses  a 
homology-based approach and involves a BLAST [45] search 
against a database, integrating several individual databases 
curated for specific analysis  [93]. For functional category 
annotation, COGs [94] and eggnogs [95] databases are used. 
COGs, one of the widely used gene categories, was cons-
tructed from 66 genomes. Because COGs has a relatively 
small  size  of  functional  categories  appropriate  for  deter-
mining well-known genes and because the database has not 
been updated for a long time, COGs shows low sensitivity for 
recently discovered genes. eggNOGs, created in 2011 and 
used  by  the  portal  service  MG-RAST,  shows  higher  sen-
sitivity than COGs, because it is constructed based on the 
pre-annotation of orthologous groups from 1,133 genomes 
using  COGs  and  KOGs.  A  BLAST-based  approach  is  still 
widely  used  in  functional  category  annotation,  but  it  is 
hampered  by  its  computational  complexity  and  lack  of 
homologous sequences in reference databases [93].

For a protein family analysis, the resources in the Pfam 
[96] and TIGRfam [97] databases are applied through the 
use of a HMM-based algorithm, profile (HMM profile), and 
search tool (HMMER; [98]). Similarity search results are 
transferred  to  annotations,  based  on  the  best  hit’s  infor-
mation.  The  Pfam  and  TIGRfam  databases  are  resources 
consisting  of  curated  multiple  alignments  and  HMMs 

generated  from  the  Sanger  Institute  and  J.  Craig  Venter 
Institute, respectively. A previous study reported that more 
protein  family  predictions  were  available  using  Pfam, 
because  the  Pfam  database  contains  a  higher  number  of 
protein  families  (14,831  protein  families  in  Pfam  27.0 
release) than TIGRfam database (4,284 protein families in 
TIGRfam 13.0 release) [93]. While IGM/M, METAREP, and 
CAMERA  use  HMM-based  databases,  such  as  Pfam  and 
TIGRfam, MG-RAST uses an HMM-independent database, 
namely FIGfams [99]. FIGfams are sets of protein sequences 
and alignments that are similar along their full length and are 
believed to implement the same function generated from 
National  Microbial  Pathogen  Data  Resource  (NMPDR). 
Gene ontology is assigned using the gene ontology (GO) 
database in most publically available pipelines. GO analysis 
was available in version 3 of MEGAN, but it was replaced by 
two functional methods, based on the SEED classification 
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) in 
MEGAN4. In addition to protein family analysis, MG-RAST 
offers information on putative protein-protein interactions 
by  applying  EMBL’s  Search  Tool  for  the  Retrieval  of 
Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) tool [100]. 

Metabolic pathway reconstruction is generally performed 
using the KEGG database [101]. While IMG/M, CAMERA, 
and MG-RAST use the KEGG database and KEGG graphs, 
METAREP uses PRIAM [102]. PRIAM is a method for auto-
mated enzyme detection, based on the available ENZYME 
database [103], and provides KEGG graphs for visualization. 
Other pathway databases and tools, like MetaCyc [104] and 
MetaPath [105], are also used to annotate functional roles 
for metagenomic data but have not yet been integrated into 
online portal services for metagenomic analysis. An alter-
native to the methods mentioned above for inferring meta-
bolic  pathways  is  ‘subsystem’  in  SEED  [66].  Subsystems 
represent the collection of functional roles that constitute 
similar or related forms of complex structural and metabolic 
pathways, such as glyoxylate bypass, sulfur oxidation, and

gration with other ‘-omics’ approaches such as metatran-
scriptomics and metaproteomics.

Future of Metagenomics

Early  metagenomic  studies  focused  mainly  on  investi-
gating  less  complex  ecosystems  and  specific  targets  in  a 
given environment due to high sequencing costs, ecosystem 
complexity,  and  lack  of  high-performance  computing  and 
bioinformatics tools. Much work has been done on testing 
new molecular techniques and tools and discovering novel 
enzymes and taxonomic lineages rather than testing many 
scientific hypotheses. This is why many previous and even 
current  studies  are  not  sufficiently  replicated  in  experi-
mental  design.  Of  course,  it  is  possible  to  compare  the 
difference  between  metagenomic  studies,  which  are  not 
replicated  [106].  However,  it  enables  us  to  obtain  stati-
stically meaningful and biologically more relevant conclu-
sions if larger sample sizes with more replicates are provided 
at a deeper layer of the sequencing regimen.

For inferring statistically meaningful differences between 
metagenome samples and exploring metabolic/taxonomic 
diversity in a given sample, metadata should be provided and 
standardized according to a proper rule. More standardized 
formats for describing marker genes, genomes, and meta-
genome datasets were recently suggested in minimum infor-
mation about any (x) sequence checklists (MIxS) [107]. This 
standardized format makes it possible to do many statistical 
analyses and meta-analyses across metagenomic studies by 
providing more standardized contextual information about 
the  environment  sampled  as  well  as  experimental  and 
sequencing  information.  Centralizing  contextual  infor-
mation will become more common in future metagenomic 
studies.

Aside  from  experimental  design  and  contextual  data, 
metagenomic data have inherent limitations that must be 
overcome in the future. Metagenomic reads commonly show 
a  relatively  low  genomic  coverage  compared  to  that  of  a 
single  genome,  and  the  short  length  of  sequencing  reads 
makes  only  fragmented  information  by  the  incomplete 
assembly and annotation processes accessible. Initiatives are 
already under way for filling the gap between metagenomic 
reads by doing co-assembly with single-cell genomics [108] 
and  joint analysis  between  multiple  metagenomes  simul-
taneously [109], on the assumption that the same species 
must exist in different samples and that the co-occurrence 
helps  extract  shared  information.  The  ultimate  goal  of 
metagenomics  is  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  our 
ecosystem. In the near future, metagenomics will be one of 
the essential parts of viewing our ecosystem through inte-

Conclusion

Over the last few years, metagenomics has accelerated the 
understanding of microbial ecology and evolution, thanks to 
the  technical  advances  of  sequencing  platforms.  Metage-
nomics  itself  is  not  a  panacea  that  is  able  to  answer  all 
unresolved questions and uncover the ‘dark matter’ of our 
knowledge in microbial diversity and function studies, but it 
is undoubtedly an excellent tool, giving insight into com-
pleting  the  jigsaw  puzzles  of  our  understanding  of  the 
surrounding biosphere by exploring both ‘who is out there’ 
and  ‘what  they  do’  in  nature.  It  is  true  that  studying 
metagenomics  is  still  recognized  by  ordinary  microbial 
ecologists  as  a  tool  that  is  difficult  to  tackle  due  to  its 
complexity and the enormous amount of sequence data that 
needs to be dealt with. However, it is not surprising that we 
will  witness  ‘doing  metagenomics’  in  the  future  as  if  we 
routinely do PCR and gel electrophoresis in our laboratory. 
Current  development  of  tools  and  databases  for  meta-
genomic studies is in its infancy, and there are still many 
challenges  to  overcome.  It  will  not  take  long  to  see  an 
explosive  growth  of  metagenomics  with  a  revolution  of 
metagenomic bioinformatics.
