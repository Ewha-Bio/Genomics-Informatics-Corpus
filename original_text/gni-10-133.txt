Genetic admixture in human, the result of inter-marriage among people from different well-differentiated populations, has 
been extensively studied in the New World, where European colonization brought contact between peoples of Europe, 
Africa,  and  Asia  and  the  Amerindian  populations.  In  Asia,  genetic  admixing  has  been  also  prevalent  among  previously 
separated human populations. However, studies on admixed populations in Asia have been largely underrepresented in 
similar efforts in the New World. Here, I will provide an overview of population genomic studies that have been published to 
date on human admixture in Asia, focusing on population structure and population history. 

Keywords: admixture mapping, genetic admixture, local adaptation, population structure

Introduction

Before  I  review  the  recent  research  progress  on  Asian 
admixed  populations,  I  would  like  to  first  give  some 
overview of the background of admixture studies, especially 
in  the  context  of  population  genomics,  since  admixture 
analysis is only feasible when individual genomic data are 
available. 

Genetic Structure of Admixed Populations

Human migration resulted in population differentiation, 
and many populations, especially those living in different 
continents,  have  been  isolated  for  quite  a  long  time. 
However, subsequent migrations that have occurred over the 
past millennia have resulted in gene flow between previously 
separated human subpopulations. This has been a common 
phenomenon throughout the history of modern humans, as 
previously  isolated  populations  often  come  into  contact 
through colonization and migration. As a result, admixed 
populations  came  into  being  when  previously  mutually 
isolated populations met and inter-married. It is important 
to  conduct  a  full  analysis  of  genetic  structure  and 
characterize the genetic make-up of admixed populations. 
On  the  one  hand,  this  will  shed  light  on  human  genetic 
history; on the other hand, increased population admixture 

influences genome heterozygosity, which in turn will affect 
phenotypes relevant to health; thus, genetic admixture has 
many implications in medical research. 

Admixture Mapping

The estimation of genetic admixture in human popula-
tions has been used for a variety of purposes, ranging from 
the confirmation of historical events, such as population of 
the effects of other biological parameters, but the emphasis 
in early studies was on gene mapping of continuous traits. 
Admixture  mapping  is  a  method  for  localizing  disease- 
causing  genetic  variants  that  differ  in  frequency  across 
populations. This approach was proposed by McKeigue in 
1998 [1]; it is based on the association of local chromosomal 
ancestry  with  the  disease,  to  test  for  the  linkage  of  the 
disease or trait with parental ancestry at each locus, defined 
as  0,  1,  or  2  allele  copies  inherited  from  the  ancestral 
populations. However, the idea of using genetic architecture 
in admixed genomes to locate disease-associated genes was 
actually  first  proposed  by  Rife  in  1954  [2],  although  the 
original  idea  was  to  use  the  admixture  linkage  disequi-
librium  (ALD)  generated  in  recently  admixed  human 
populations to assign the traits to linkage groups. 

Admixture of populations often leads to extended linkage 
disequilibrium  (LD),  which  could  greatly  facilitate  the

mapping of human disease genes [3-6]. Gene mapping by 
admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) has been shown 
to have special value theoretically [4, 7-14] and empirically 
[15-29]. MALD has received much attention recently [3, 5]. 
The initial attraction of MALD was its significantly increased 
extension of LD (or extended LD) in admixed populations, 
which requires far fewer markers in mapping disease genes. 
Previous  studies  predicted  that  MALD  typically  requires 
only 2,000-3,000 ancestry informative markers (AIMs) for a 
genomewide search [1, 16]. The utility of MALD depends 
upon  how  far  LD  extends  over  a  chromosomal  interval, 
which, in turn, dictates the spacing and number of markers 
required for a genomewide scan. Therefore, it is imperative 
to  characterize  the  magnitude  and  extent  of  ALD  in  the 
admixed population in which MALD will be performed.

Stephens  et  al.  [10]  showed  that  ALD  in  African- 
Americans  (AfAs)  could  exist  up  to  10  cM,  even  after  9 
generations by simulation. Parra et al. [30] reported strong 
LD between the FY-null and AT3 loci, which are 22 cM apart 
on  chromosome  1q22.  Substantially  extended  LD  in  AfA 
populations  were  reported  in  several  regions  or  chromo-
somes [31-33] using primarily short tandem repeat markers. 
Patterson et al. [12] showed that strong ALD extends to 17 
cM on average in AfAs. Contrarily, it was also reported that 
the LD in AfA populations is shorter than or similar to those 
seen  in  non-admixed  populations  using  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs)-detectable to about 44 kb or larger 
[34]. The contradicting observations might be due to the 
selection  of  the  markers  based  on  their  allele  frequency 
difference  between  the  parental  populations,  as  shown 
theoretically by Chakraborty and Weiss [7]. It is therefore 
important to examine empirically the relationship of LD in 
the  admixed  population  and  allele  frequency  difference 
between parental populations. In fact, there have been many 
studies that have investigated LD patterns in recent admixed 
populations, such as the AfAs, Mexicans, and Hispanics. In 
Asia, the only study published so far is on the Uyghurs in 
Xinjiang, China [35]. 

In practice, the principle of admixture mapping, proposed 
by McKeigue [1], is a little different from that of MALD, 
because it is based on the association of local chromosomal 
ancestry with the disease rather than on LD between the 
marker and phenotype, but the information and essence are 
the same. It is most advantageous to apply this approach to 
populations that have descended from a recent mix of two 
ancestral groups that have been geographically isolated for 
many tens of thousands of years, providing new insights into 
population history and genotype-phenotype relationships. 
With the efforts of many scientists in this field, statistical 
methods, panels of AIMs for admixture typing, and software 
programs have been rapidly developed; in addition, recent 

advances in genotyping and sequencing technologies have 
facilitated  genomewide  investigation  of  human  genetic 
variations. Admixture mapping has been applied to a wide 
range of traits and diseases, for which it is hypothesized that 
the differences in disease rates across populations are due to 
population-specific  frequency  differences  of  the  causal 
variant(s). 

Ancestry Informative Markers 

To  apply  admixture  mapping,  a  set  of  genetic  markers 
called  AIMs,  provide  information  at  each  locus  of  the 
ancestral origin of the allele. An AIM is a polymorphic locus 
that exhibits substantially different allele frequencies bet-
ween  the  ancestral  populations,  which  are  often  from 
different geographical regions. For example, Fig. 1 shows an 
allele frequency distribution of 9,781 AIMs screened from 
genomewide SNPs from European (EUR) and East Asian 
(EAS) populations. With a set of AIMs, one can estimate the 
geographical origins of the ancestors of an individual and 
ascertain what proportion of the ancestry is derived from 
each geographical region. The primary utility of estimates of 
continental ancestry using AIMs is to control for confoun-
ding  from  population  stratification  in  genetic  association 
studies among unrelated individuals from admixed popu-
lations. Population admixture has the potential to lead to 
confounding results from population stratification in genetic 
association  studies,  leading  to  both  false  positive  (type  I 
error) and false negative (type II error) results [36-39]. Now, 
to facilitate the application of admixture mapping, a number

of high-density mapping panels have been constructed, Such 
panels  are  already  available  for  disease  gene  discovery  in 
AfAs  [16,  21,  40,  41],  Hispanics/Latinos  [23,  26,  40], 
Mexican-Americans  (the  largest  subgroup  of  Hispanic/ 
Latinos) [28, 41], and Uyghurs [35]. 

Local Adaptation of Admixed Populations

Identifying  targets  of  positive  selection  in  humans  has 
been a central topic in human evolutionary and population 
genetics.  Traditional  studies  have  been  relying  on  the 
analysis of individual candidate genes. Since the genomics 
era,  the  availability  of  high-density  SNPs  has  provided 
essential  resources  for  systematically  interrogating  the 
entire genome for detecting signatures of natural selection. 
As a matter of fact, many genomewide scans for recent or 
ongoing positive selection have been recently performed in 
humans,  while  most  of  the  studies  to  date  have  been 
performed in non-admixed populations. In the situation of 
genetic  admixture,  when  previously  isolated  populations 
meet and mix, the resulting admixed population can benefit 
from several genetic advantages, including increased genetic 
variation, the creation of novel genotypes, and the masking 
of deleterious mutations, and these admixture benefits are 
thought to play an important role in biological adaptation to 
local environment. As a result, this has led to the use of 
admixture estimates to detect the action of natural selection 
in human populations. Such techniques have been regarded 
as powerful methods for the detection of selection effects, 
especially when an appreciable number of generations have

elapsed since the original admixture. 

Several studies based on  genomic  data have  been con-
ducted in recently admixed populations in the New World 
[42-44]. Recently, we developed a new approach that can be 
used  to  detect  natural  selection  both  before  and  after 
population admixture, and we applied this method in AfA 
data.  It  is  particularly  meaningful  to  investigate  natural 
selection  in  AfAs  due  to  the  high  mortality  their  African 
ancestry  has  experienced  in  history.  In  this  study,  we 
examined  491,526  autosomal  SNPs  genotyped  in  5,210 
individuals  and  conducted  a  genomewide  search  for 
selection  signals  in  1,890  AfAs.  Several  genomic  regions 
showing  excess  African  or  EUR  ancestry,  which  were 
thought of as the footprints of selection since population 
admixture,  were  detected  based  on  a  commonly  used 
approach.  However,  we  also  developed  a  new  strategy  to 
detect  natural  selection  both  pre-  and  post-admixture  by 
reconstructing an ancestral African population (AAF) from 
inferred  African  components  of  ancestry  in  AfAs  and 
comparing  it  with  indigenous  African  populations  (IAF). 
Interestingly, many selection candidate genes identified by 
the  new  approach  were  associated  with  AfA-specific 
high-risk diseases, such as prostate cancer and hypertension, 
suggesting  an  important  role  that  these  disease-related 
genes might have played in adapting to a new environment. 
CD36  and  HBB,  whose  mutations  confer  a  degree  of 
protection against malaria, were also located in the highly 
differentiated  regions  between  AAF  and  IAF.  Further 
analysis showed that the frequencies of alleles protecting 
against malaria in AAF were lower than that in IAF, which is

consistent with the relaxed selection pressure of malaria in 
the  New  World.  There  is  no  overlap  between  the  top 
candidate genes detected by the 2 approaches, indicating the 
different  environmental  pressures  AfAs  experienced  pre- 
and post-population admixture. We suggest that the new 
approach  (see  Fig.  2  for  a  schematic  framework  of  this 
approach) is reasonably powerful and can also be applied to 
other admixed populations, such as Latinos and Uyghurs. 
I will not go further on this topic in this review paper, since 
so far there is no study that has been performed in Asian 
populations using admixture analysis. However, we believe 
that the discoveries have greatly enriched our understanding 
of human origins and history and hold large potential for 
identifying genes with important biological functions; this, 
in  turn,  will  elucidate  the  genetic  basis  of  some  human 
diseases [45, 46]. These studies together provide many new 
insights into the natural selection process and mechanisms, 
which will ultimately improve the modern evolution theory.

Population Admixture Dynamics

Human diasporas over the past millennia have resulted in 
even more frequent intercontinental marriages and popula-
tion admixtures. Many recently admixed populations, such 
as AfAs and Mestizos, have received much attention due to 
their  potential  advantages  in  the  discovery  of  disease- 
associated  genes.  Particularly,  a  disease  gene  mapping 
strategy,  named  admixture  mapping  or  MALD,  as  afore-
mentioned, has been developed [1, 7, 11, 47]. The statistical 
power of admixture mapping or MALD relies on the fact that 
population  admixture  creates  extended  and  elevated  LD 

between  loci  with  different  allele  frequencies  among  the 
parental source populations [7, 10, 48], while the historical 
population admixture processes determine the LD pattern in 
an  admixed  population.  Therefore,  as  shown  in  several 
theoretical  and  simulation  studies,  population  admixture 
dynamics have a strong effect on the power of admixture 
mapping [48-51].

In fact, accurate understanding of population admixture 
dynamics is important not only to admixture mapping but 
also to other applications, such as elucidating population 
history [52] and detecting natural selection signatures in 
admixed populations [49, 53]. However, the fine admixture 
dynamics of recently admixed populations has not been well 
established, even though some studies have examined the 
simulated data [54, 55] or experimental data with sparse 
markers  [48,  51].  In  addition,  admixture  dynamics  of 
relatively  ancient  admixed  populations  has  rarely  been 
studied.  Recently,  the  availability  of  genomewide  high- 
density  SNPs  data  has  facilitated  the  study  on  detailed 
genetic structures of admixed populations [35, 44, 56-61]. 
However, most of these studies relied on simplified models 
that do not take into account the inherent complexity of the 
admixture processes. Moreover, the haplotype and chromo-
somal  segment  patterns  shaped  by  recombination  within 
each  individual  have  been  deliberately  ignored  in  most 
studies due to many inherent challenges [62]. 

For  individuals  from  admixed  populations  that  have 
existed  for  a  long  time,  their  chromosomes  resemble  a 
mosaic  of  chromosomal  segments  of  distinct  ancestry 
(CSDA). The CSDA in the admixed population would have 
been  reshaped  and  rearranged  by  recombination  in  each

Pop2 are m1 and m2, respectively.

generation, which should provide some information about 
the population history. In other words, the CSDA will be 
spliced  into  smaller  pieces  as  the  number  of  generations 
since  admixture  increases,  while  the  chromosomes  from 
recently admixed individuals contain much longer CSDAs. 
Information regarding the average CSDA length has been 
used to infer the number of generations since admixture in 
various  studies  [57,  63-66].  However,  the  distribution  of 
CSDA  length  may  contain  more  valuable  information 
concerning  population  admixture  history  and  admixture 
dynamics, which has not yet been explored.

In  a  recent  study  [67],  we  proposed  2  approaches  to 
explore population admixture dynamics and, by analyzing 
genomewide  empirical  and  simulated  data,  demonstrated 
that the approach based on the distribution of CSDA was 
more  powerful  than  that  based  on  the  distribution  of 
individual  ancestry  proportions.  As  a  result,  analysis  of 
1,890  AfAs  showed  that  a  continuous  gene  flow  (CGF) 
model (Fig. 3), in which AfAs continuously received gene 
flow from EUR populations over about 14 generations, best 
explained the admixture dynamics of AfAs among several 
putative models. Interestingly, we observed that some AfAs 
had much more EUR ancestry than the simulated samples, 
indicating  substructures  of  local  ancestries  in  AfAs  that 
could have been caused by individuals from some particular 
lineages having continuously inter-married with people of 
EUR ancestry. On the contrary, the admixture dynamics of 
Mexicans  was  more  likely  to  be  explained  by  a  gradual 
admixture  (GA)  model  (Fig.  3),  in  which  Mexicans 
continuously  received  gene  flow  from  both  EUR  and 
Amerindian  populations  for  about  24  generations.  The 
higher  proportion  of  long  CSDAs  observed  in  Mexican- 
Americans  relative  to  Mexican-Mestizos  suggested  recent 
gene flow from EUR-Americans to Mexican-Americans. The 
genetic  components  of  sub-Saharan  Africans  in  Middle 
Eastern  populations,  such  as  Mozabite,  Bedouin,  and 
Palestinians,  could  be  explained  by  one  early  admixture 
followed  by  some  recent  gene  flow  from  Africans.  In 
summary, this study not only provides new approaches to 
explore population admixture dynamics but also advances 
our  understanding  on  historical  admixture  processes  of 
AfAs, Mexicans, and Middle Eastern populations. 

Again, since admixed populations in Asia have not been 
studied, I will not go further into details. This approach can 
be also applied in admixed populations in Asia to explore the 
admixture dynamics of admixed populations in Asia. 

Genetic  Structure  and  History  of  Admixed 
Populations in Different Geographical Regions

In the following, I will review the studies on population 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

admixture  in  different  geographical  regions  in  Asia－i.e., 
East Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. 

Population Admixture in East Asia

In  East  Asia,  most  of  the  populations  that  have  been 
studied  are  thought  to  be  relatively  homogeneous.  Most 
people identify themselves with one particular ethnic group, 
but in fact, we are highly mixed. A report from the HUGO 
PanAsia SNP Consortium, which was published in Science in 
2009 [68], revealed a picture of prevalent gene flow among 
Asian populations. As a collaborative effort of 93 scientists 
from 10 countries, this study conducted the first large-scale 
and genomewide study on the genetic diversity of 73 Asian 
populations, representing a broad geographic sample of the 
major ethnic groups and linguistic families in Asia. 

Considerable  gene  flow  among  Asian  populations  was 
observed  amongst  sub-populations  in  these  clusters, 
including those groups believed to practice endogamy based 
on linguistic, cultural, and ethnic information. In fact, most 
populations studied show evidence of admixture in popu-
lation  structure  analyses.  For  example,  the  Han  Chinese 
have grown to become the largest ethnic group today, in a 
demographic  expansion  that  has  occurred  mostly  within 
historical times. The analysis in this study reveals that the 6 
Han Chinese populations show varying degrees of admix-
ture  (Fig.  4)  between  a  northern  ‘Altaic’  cluster  and  a 
‘Sino-Tibetan/Tai-Kadai’ cluster, which is most frequent in 
the  ethnic  groups  sampled  from  southern  China  and 
northern Thailand. Finally, most of the Indian populations 
showed evidence of shared ancestry with EUR populations, 
which is consistent with our understanding of the expansion 
of Indo-EUR speaking populations (Fig. 4). 

Population Admixture in Central Asia

Many  human  populations  that  settled  in  Central  Asia 
demonstrate an array of mixed anthropological features of 
East  Eurasians  (EEA)  and  West  Eurasians  (WEA),  indi-
cating a possible scenario of biological admixture between 
already differentiated EEA and WEA populations. However, 
their  complex  biological  origin  and  genomic  make-up,  as 
well as their genetic interaction with surrounding popula-
tions, are not well understood. Despite Central Asia being a 
vast territory that has been crucial in human history due to 
its strategic location [69], populations in this region are not 
on the list of the  2 large-scale international collaborative 
efforts, such as the International HapMap Project [70] and 
the  1000  Genome  Project  [71],  and  population  genomic 
studies  on  Central  Asian  populations  have  been  largely 
underrepresented in similar efforts worldwide [68, 72-76].

group or neighboring geographic locations tend to share the same cluster. At K = 14, each language family can be specified by a cluster
(color), although Sino-Tibetan-speaking populations tend to cluster with both Altaic- and Tai-Kadai-speaking populations. The figure shown
for  a  given  K  is  based  on  the  highest  probability  run  of  10  STRUCTURE  runs  at  that  K.

In  an  attempt  to  decipher  the  genetic  structure  and 
population history in Central Asia, we conducted, to our 
knowledge,  the  first  genomewide  studies  of  the  Uyghur 
residing  in  Xinjiang,  which  is  geographically  located  in 
Central Asia. Uyghur that settled in Xinjiang of China (UIG) 
is a population presenting a typical admixture of eastern and 
western  anthropometric  traits;  we  dissected  its  genomic 
structure  at  the  population  level,  individual  level,  and 
chromosome level using 20,177 SNPs spanning over almost 
the entire chromosome 21. Our results showed that UIG was 
formed by two-way admixture, with 60% of ancestry from 
EUR and 40% of ancestry from EAS. Overall LD in UIG was 
similar to that in its parental populations, represented by 
EAS  and  EUR  for  common  alleles,  and  UIG  manifested 
elevation of LD only within 500 kb and at a level of 0.1 ＜ r2 
＜ 0.8  when  AIMs  were  used.  The  size  of  chromosomal 
segments that were derived from EASs and EURs was on 
average 2.4 cM and 4.1 cM, respectively. Both the magnitude 
of  LD  and  fragmentary  ancestral  chromosome  segments 
indicated  a  long  period  of  history  of  Uyghur.  Under  the 
assumption of a hybrid isolation (HI) model, the admixture 

event of UIG was estimated to have taken place about 126 
(107-146)  generations,  or  2,520  (2,140-2,920)  years  ago, 
assuming 20 years per generation. In spite of the long history 
and short LD of Uyghur compared with recent admixture 
populations, such as African-Americans, we suggested that 
MALD is still applicable in Uyghur, except that about 10-fold 
AIMs are necessary for a whole-genome scan. 

Later in the same year, following up on our previous study, 
we  conducted  a  genomewide  analysis  of  admixture  for  2 
Uyghur population samples (HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG) 
collected  from  northern  and  southern  Xinjiang  of  China, 
respectively.  Both  HGDP-UG  and  PanAsia-UG  showed 
substantial admixture of EAS and EUR ancestries, with an 
empirical  estimation  of  ancestry  contribution  of  53：47 
(EAS：EUR) and 48：52 for HGDP-UG and PanAsia-UG, 
respectively.  The  effective  admixture  time  under  a  model 
with a single pulse of admixture was estimated to be 110 
generations  and  129  generations;  i.e.,  admixture  events 
occurred  about  2,200  years  and  2,580  years  ago  for 
HGDP-UG  and  PanAsia-UG,  respectively,  assuming  an 
average  of  20  years  per  generation.  Despite  their  earlier

history versus other admixture populations, such as AfAs 
and  Latinos,  admixture  mapping,  an  economical  and 
powerful approach for localizing disease genes, holds equal 
promise for Uyghurs because of their mixture of ancestry 
from different continents as well as their large population 
size.  We  screened  multiple  databases  and  identified  a 
genomewide SNP panel that can distinguish EAS and EUR 
ancestry of chromosomal segments in Uyghurs. The panel 
contains  8,150 AIMs showing large frequency differences 
between EAS and EUR (FST > 0.25, mean FST = 0.43) but 
little  frequency  difference  (7,999  AIMs  validated)  within 
both EAS and EUR populations (FST ＜ 0.05, mean FST ＜ 
0.01). We evaluated the effectiveness of this admixture map 
for localizing disease genes in 2 Uyghur populations. Our 
map constitutes the first practical resource for admixture 
mapping in Uyghurs, and it will enable studies of diseases 
showing  different  genetic  risks  in  European  and  EAS 
populations. 

Population Admixture in Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia, together with the Island Pacific region, is 
a cultural melting pot of migrating Neolithic farmers and 
indigenous  Mesolithic  hunter-gatherer  communities.  On 
the basis of increased cultural, linguistic, and genetic diver-
sity, the origins of Southeast Asian populations are thought 
to be more complex than those to their north. Two major 
prehistoric movements of people had great influence on the 
linguistic, cultural, and genetic diversity of the region. The 
first  colonization  of  modern  humans  in  the  region  was 
around 45,000 years before the present [77], which could 
have  brought  the  ancestors  of  modern  Papuans  and 
Australians  into  the  region  [78].  Notably,  archaeological 
evidence  has  confirmed  human  habitation  in  Eastern 
Indonesia as far back as 32,000 years ago [79]. The second 
major human migration event, which is often termed the 
Austronesian  expansion,  was  relatively  recent,  coinciding 
with the first agricultural settlements in Island Southeast 
Asia  (ISEA)  [80];  it  is  often  putatively  linked  to  demic 
dispersal  from  mainland  China  during  the  Mid-Holocene 
[81],  and  based  on  linguistic  studies,  the  Austronesian 
expansion is proposed to have originated in Taiwan around 
5,000-6,000 years ago and spread to Southeast Asia, Near 
and Remote Oceania, and Madagascar [82, 83]. However, 
our  knowledge  about  the  historical  origin  and  spread  of 
Austronesian-speaking  peoples  has  been  overwhelmingly 
from linguistic, archeological, and anthropological studies, 
while contributions from genetic studies are limited, and 
especially, genetic dating of the expansion time of Austro-
nesians is almost absent [84]. 

Undoubtedly, the Austronesian expansion has had a major 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

cultural influence on Asia-Pacific pre-history. The biological 
contribution  of  Austronesian-speaking  peoples  to  the 
pre-existing  local  populations  in  ISEA  was  first  noted  by 
Wallace in 1869 [85]. As Wallace observed, people in the 
region between mainland Asia and New Guinea in the west 
are similar to their neighbors in mainland Southeast Asia, 
while the eastern groups near New Guinea are similar to 
Melanesians, leaving intervening populations intermediate 
in appearance [85]. This admixture pattern was revealed by 
mtDNA and non-recombining region of the Y chromosome 
(NRY) studies [86, 87] as well as by a recent study [81] 
based on multiple autosomal and X-chromosomal SNPs. 

The genetic admixture with local populations during the 
Austronesian expansion could provide a unique opportunity 
to  shed  light  on  the  migration  history  of  Austronesian- 
speaking  people.  However,  previous  studies  based  on 
haploid genomes could not study admixture at the individual 
level. Studies of multiple loci of the nuclear genome are more 
powerful [88] in studying admixture at the individual level, 
but  the  sparse  low-density  loci  examined  in  previous 
genomewide studies do not allow estimation of the admix-
ture  time,  which  relies  on  recombination  information 
extracted from high-density genomewide data. 

We analyzed dense genomewide SNP data from 2 studies 
[68, 89]. The first consists of about 50,000 SNPs analyzed in 
288 individuals from 13 Austronesian-speaking populations 
and  2  Papuan-speaking  populations  across  Indonesia  and 
Papua  New  Guinea,  while  the  second  consists  of  about 
680,000 SNPs analyzed in 36 individuals from 7 populations 
from Indonesia and 25 individuals from New Guinea. Apart 
from a general description of population structure and its 
relationship  with  geography,  language,  and  demographic 
history,  we  focus  on  estimating  the  amount  and  time  of 
admixture involving Asian and Papuan ancestry across E. 
Indonesia to test the various scenarios that might explain the 
admixture  history.  Because  genetic  recombination  breaks 
down parental genomes into segments of different sizes, the 
genome of a descendant of an admixture event is composed 
of different combinations of these ancestral segments, or 
‘blocks’ [90]. Admixture time can be estimated from the 
information based on distribution of ancestral segments and 
the recombination breakpoints in an admixed genome [34, 
57,  63,  66,  90].  In  this  study,  we  assume  that  a  cline  of 
admixture times that decreases from west to east across E. 
Indonesia  would  support  a  scenario  of  incoming  Asians 
admixing with indigenous Papuan groups, while a cline in 
the  opposite  direction  would  indicate  incoming  Papuans 
admixing with resident Asians. Moreover, the actual admix-
ture times would indicate when the migration occurred. Our 
approach is thus to estimate population admixture time by 
taking advantage of available genomewide data of both E.

Indonesian  populations  showing  admixture  and  their 
ancestry reference populations. 

In summary, the admixture time analysis of 2 different 
datasets provides compelling evidence that people of Asian 
ancestry began moving through E. Indonesia about 4,000 
years  ago,  from  west  to  east,  and  admixed  with  resident 
groups of Papuan ancestry. Furthermore, this scenario is in 
excellent  agreement  with  linguistic  and  archeological 
evidence for a pre-Austronesian presence of Papuans in E. 
Indonesia [91, 92] and for an eastward spread of Austrone-
sian-speaking  farmers  across  E.  Indonesia  [82,  83].  Our 
analyses  thus  refute  suggestions  that  the  Asian  ancestry 
observed  in  Indonesia  largely  predates  the  Austronesian 
expansion [93, 94]. Instead, our analyses of genomewide 
data indicate that there was a strong and significant genetic 
impact  associated  with  the  Austronesian  expansion  in 
Indonesia, just as similar analyses have pointed to a strong 
and  significant  genetic 
impact  associated  with  the 
Austronesian expansion through Near and Remote Oceania 
[87, 95, 96]. Given that admixture among human popula-
tions  (and  between  modern  and  archaic  humans)  is 
increasingly  being  recognized  as  a  significant  aspect  of 
modern  human  biology  [97],  estimates  of  the  time  of 
admixture should provide important new insights into the 
history of our species. 

Population Admixture in South Asia

All  the  published  results  in  this  area  so  far  have  been 
focused  on  populations  in  India.  There  were  recently  2 
studies on the Siddis, which are a group of people showing 
evident  genetic  admixture  in  India.  The  Siddis  (Afro- 
Indians)  are  a  tribal  population  whose  members  live  in 
coastal  Karnataka,  Gujarat,  and  some  parts  of  Andhra 
Pradesh.  Historical  records  indicate  that  the  Portuguese 
brought the Siddis to India from Africa about 300-500 years 
ago;  members  of  this  population  are  believed  to  be 
descendants  of  the  Bantu-speaking  population  of  Africa. 
However, there is little information about their more precise 
ancestral  origins.  One  Indian  group,  led  by  Dr.  Mukerji, 
studied this population [98] based on genomewide SNP data 
generated using Affymetrix 50K chips. The authors carried 
out this study by using a set of 18,534 autosomal markers 
common  between  Indian,  CEPH-HGDP,  and  HapMap 
populations. Principal components analysis clearly revealed 
that the African-Indian population derived its ancestry from 
Bantu-speaking  west  African  as  well  as  Indo-European- 
speaking  north  and  northwest  Indian  population(s). 
STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE analyses show that overall, 
the OG-W-IPs derived 58.7% of their genomic ancestry from 
their  African  past  and  have  very  little  inter-individual 

ancestry variation (8.4%). The extent of LD also reveals that 
the admixture event has been recent. Functional annotation 
of genes encompassing the AIMs that are closer in allele 
frequency  to  the  Indian  ancestral  population  revealed 
significant enrichment of biological processes, such as ion 
channel activity, and cadherins. They briefly examined the 
implications  of  determining  the  genetic  diversity  of  this 
population, which could provide opportunities for studies 
involving admixture mapping. 

The  second  group,  led  by  Dr.  Thangaraj,  performed  a 
genomewide survey to understand the population history of 
the Siddis [99]. Using hundreds of thousands of autosomal 
markers,  they  showed  that  the  Siddis  inherited  ancestry 
from  Africans,  Indians,  and  possibly  Europeans  (Portu-
guese).  Additionally,  analyses  of  the  uniparental  (Y- 
chromosomal  and  mitochondrial  DNA)  markers  indicate 
that the Siddis trace their ancestry to Bantu speakers from 
sub-Saharan  Africa.  They  estimated  that  the  admixture 
between the African ancestors of the Siddis and neighboring 
South  Asian  groups  probably  occurred  in  the  past  8 
generations  (-200  years  ago),  consistent  with  historical 
records. 

Perspective

Recent advances in genotyping and sequencing techno-
logies have facilitated genomewide investigation of human 
genetic variations and provided new insights into population 
structure and admixture history. Admixed populations are 
attracting more and more attention from both evolutionary 
and medical studies as well as from the other fields. Without 
understanding the genetic structure and history of admixed 
populations  well,  our  knowledge  about  human  genetics 
would not be complete. Unfortunately, studies on admixed 
populations in Asia are so far very limited, although gene 
flow among Asian populations is prevalent [68]. The studies 
published and mentioned in this review have been focused 
on investigating the genetic structure and genetic history of 
a  limited  number  of  well-known  admixed  populations  in 
Asia.  Further  efforts  should  be  made  to  reveal  local 
adaptation signatures and also apply admixture mapping in 
those well-known admixed populations; in the future, more 
powerful methods are expected to be developed and applied 
to many more populations with longer histories and more 
complex admixture scenarios.
