Abstract 
Alternative splicing  (AS)  is  an  important mechanism  of 
producing transcriptome diversity and microarray techniques 
are being used increasingly to monitor the splice variants. 
There exist three types of microarrays interrogating AS 
events-junction, exon, and tiling arrays. Junction probes 
have the advantage of monitoring the splice site directly. 
Johnson  et  at.,  performed  a  genome-wide  survey  of 
human alternative pre-mRNA splicing with exon junction 
microarrays  (Science  302:2141-2144,  2003),  which 
monitored splicing at every known exon-exon junctions 
for  more  than  10,000  multi-exon  human  genes  in  52 
tissues and cell  lines.  Here, we describe an algorithm to 
deduce the  relative  concentration  of  isoforms  from  the 
junction  array  data.  Non-negative  Matrix  Factorization 
(NMF)  is  applied  to  obtain  the  transcript  structure 
inferred from the expression data. Then we choose  the 
transcript models consistent with the  ECgene model of 
alternative splicing which  is  based  on  mRNA and  EST 
alignment.  The  probe-transcript  matrix  is  constructed 
using the  NMF-consistent  ECgene transcripts,  and  the 
isoform  abundance  is  deduced  from  the  non-negative 
least  squares  (NNLS)  fitting  of experimental  data.  Our 
method  can  be  easily  extended  to  other  types  of 
microarrays with exon or junction probes.

splicing  recently.  The major advantage  is that  splicing 
pattern of numerous exons can be monitored simultaneously 
(Shoemaker  et  at.,  2001).  It  is  the  most  promising 
technique that can show the transcript variation due to 
alternative  splicing  in  various  tissues,  developmental, 
and  pathological  conditions  (Xu  eta/.,  2002;  Hu  eta/., 
2002).  Proper  interpretation  can  give  information  on 
transcript structure and expression pattern of genes in an 
efficient way. However, there is no standard in manufacturing 
arrays and in interpreting the data yet. 

To monitor alternative splicing events with microarray 
technique,  one  needs  special  probe  design  that  can 
report whether specific exons or splice sites are present 
in  the  transcript  or  not.  Arrays  of  this  type  are  called 
'splice arrays' and oligonucleotides are typically used as 
probe sequences. Splice arrays can be further classified 
into three sub-groups- junction, exon, and tiling array as 
shown in Fig.  1. 

Exon  probe  sequences  are  part  of  a  single  exon, 
thereby  manifesting  expression  of  the  corresponding 
exon. Multiple probes are necessary to identify alternatively 
spliced exons using exon probes.  Its main disadvantage 
would be that exact splice sites cannot be obtained. On 
the other hand, junction probes consist of concatenation 
of two neighboring exons. Presence of each splice site is 
directly examined and any variation  in the splice site is 
reflected  in the probe intensity.  However, the sequence 
composition is fairly limited since they cannot be far from 
the splice site. Hybridization efficiency might be different 
for each probe, which is a difficult problem to overcome 
in analyzing experimental  result.  Recent trend is to use 
both the junction and exon probes for reliable prediction 
of splice site variation (Pan et at.,  2004; Fehlbaum et at., 
2005;  Ule et at.,  2005). 

Tiling  array  is  collection  of  probes  reflecting  the 
genomic  map.  Original  purpose  of the  tiling  array  was

interrogating  whether  a  specific  part  of  the  genome  is 
transcribed  or  not.  Since  it  is  unbiased  mapping  of 
transcription, it can be used to monitor alternative splicing. 
The main problems are cost and resolution. Researchers 
at the Affymetrix Inc.  reported tiling array experiment for 
chromosomes 21  and 22 at 35 nt.  resolution as early as 
in 2002 (Kampa eta/., 2004). Their recent update includes 
10 chromosomes at 5 nt. resolution (Cheng eta/., 2005). 
Even  though  it  cannot  be  applied  for  general  purpose 
due to high cost, the experimental data can be a reference 
point for transcription with additional tissue data. 

Johnson et al. performed a junction array experiment 
that covers -10,000 human  RefSeq genes in 52 tissues 
and cell lines (Johnson eta/., 2003).  Each probe sequence 
consists of 36 nucleotides from two adjacent exons (last 
18-mer in the preceding exon and the first 18-mer in the 
following exon) and a linker sequence. Every exon-exon 
junction  within  RefSeq  is  taken  into  consideration  in 
designing the probe sequences.  Resulting hybridization 
reflects the splice-site variation owing to AS.  For example, 
exon skipping of the 8-th exon produces reduced probe 
intensity for two adjacent probes at donor and acceptor 
splice sites of the exon 8. 

Even though Johnson eta/., demonstrated successfully 
that  microarray  could  be  used  to  study  alternative 
splicing  at  genome-wide  level,  their  analysis  is  fairly 
limited in several aspects. The most important drawback 
is that their interpretation lacks any quantitative prediction 
of isoform concentration. They intentionally avoided building 
any transcript  models  from  the  experimental  data  and 
just examined if any probe intensity is below expectation, 
which is a good indication of alternative splicing event. 

Predicting  transcript  structure  and  abundance  for 
each isoform simultaneously would be the most important, 
but truly demanding task in the presence of experimental 
noise.  A  research  group at  the  Affymetrix  Inc.  and the 
University  of  California  at  Santa  Cruz  developed  a 
method  to  determine the  relative  abundance  of  known 
splice variants through a maximum likelihood estimation 
framework (Wang eta/., 2003). Their analysis assumes 
that splice variants  and  their gene  structure  present  in 
the sample are  known.  No attempt to detect any  novel 
splice variants was made. 

Here, we describe an algorithm to deduce the relative 
concentration  of  isoforms from  the junction  array data. 
First,  Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF;  Lee and 
Seung, 1999) is applied to obtain the transcript structure 
inferred from  the expression data. Then we choose the 
transcript models consistent with the  ECgene model  of 
alternative splicing since the transcript models predicted 
from NMF are often unreliable. ECgene transcripts have 
mRNA or EST sequences as a supporting evidence. The 

probe-transcript matrix is constructed using the resulting 
ECgene  transcripts  and  the  isoform  abundance  is 
deduced  from  the  non-negative  least  squares  (NNLS} 
fitting  of  experimental  data.  Our  method  takes  the 
non-negative  nature  of  concentration 
into  account 
explicitly,  which  gives  dramatic  difference  from  other 
decomposition-based methods. It can be easily extended 
to  other  types  of  microarrays  with  exon  or  junction 
probes (e.g. Affymetrix's exon chips). 

Methods 
Datasets 
Johnson  et  a/.,'s  junction-array  data  (GSE740)  were 
downloaded  from  the  GEO  website  (Gene  Express 
Omnibus,  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo).  It  contains 
more than 10,000 multi-exon human genes in 52 tissues 
and  cell  lines.  Oligonucleotide  probes  were  placed  at 
every  exon-exon  junction  in  each  transcript.  The  data 
covers 1 05,398 probes, 1 0,27 4 genes, 11,138 GenBank 
accession and 1 ,646 genomic contigs. 

Every  probe  sequence  should  be  mapped  onto  the 
splice junctions in the ECgene transcripts. We compared 
the  gene  symbols,  GenBank  accession  numbers,  and 
explicit  sequences  used  in  GSE740  with  the  ECgene 
annotations.  The  resulting  gene  symbol,  GenBank 
accession,  ECgene ID, transcript ID,  exon number, and 
probe sequences were stored  in  the  MySQL database. 
Using  the  latest  ECgene  version  1.2,  we  were  able to 
map 95,945  probes out of  105,389 probes  in  GSE740. 
Some RefSeqs could not be aligned against the genome 
with good quality. 

One subtle point is worth mentioning. Johnson eta/., 
made probes for each RefSeq.  In other words,  if a gene 
had more than two RefSeqs representing splice variants, 
junction  probe  sequences  can  be  redundant.  We 
searched  all  redundant  probe  sequences  and  took the 
average value in the subsequent steps. 

Algorithmic details 
Problem setup: The experimental data can be represented 
as  an  expression  matrix  E  whose  element  Ept  is  the 
hybridization intensity of probe pfor tissue t.  The expression 
value for each probe depends on several factors including 
isoform abundance, isoform structure and probe affinity. 
The relation can be written as 

Ept : probe intensity matrix of probe p for tissue type t 
M p;:  probe-transcript  matrix of probe p for transcript

in tissue type t 

Xit  is the abundance  (i.e.  concentration)  of isoform  i in 
tissue t.  The matrix M is the probe-transcript matrix whose 
element Mp;  represents the presence of probe sequence 
p in  isoform  i.  Mp;  is  1  if the  probe  sequence  is  part of 
mRNA sequence for isoform i.  In  matrix representation, 
Eq.  (1) can be rewritten as

relative concenhation of tile isofonn in a given tissue 

(X) from the expression data (E). This is not an easy task 
since (i) we do not have the full catalog of transcripts (i.e. 
splice variants), (ii) all parameters in Eq. (2) are non-negative. 
Without the first problem, the NNLS (non-negative least 
squares)  fitting  method  or  the  maximum  likelihood 
optimization (Wang eta/., 2003) can be used to obtain the 
transcript abundance  in  various tissues.  They take the 
non-negative nature of abundance explicitly. 

Our method, named as the "isoAbundance" algorithm, 
combines NMF and NNLS procedures to obtain reliable 
transcript models and their relative concentration in each 
tissue.  Fig.  3 shows a brief flowchart of the algorithm. 
Data  Pre-processing:  Before  any  data  processing,  we 
filtered  bad  or  non-informative  probes.  Probes  whose 
mean natural log intensities across 52 tissues were less 
than  0.65  or  larger than  11  were  flagged  as  dark and 
saturated,  respectively.  Probes  with  constant  intensity 
were  also  removed  since  they  are  likely  due to  cross(cid:173)
hybridization. 
Selection of putative transcripts using NMF: Non-negative 
Matrix Factorization was applied to solve Eq. (2). Original 
version of NMF was to decompose a matrix V  ~ WH where 
V,  W,  H  are  non-negative  matrices  (Lee  and  Seung, 
1999). This is exactly the same situation  as in  Eq.  (2). 
Non-negativity constraint makes NMF distinguished from 
other methods such as the principal component analysis 
(PCA)  or  NMF  allows  a  parts- based  representation 
because  only  additive  combinations  are  allowed.  NMF 
applied to  decompose the expression  matrix E  ~ MX, 
allows the extraction of hidden localized patterns such as 
alternative  splicing  of  exons.  Applying  NMF  to  the 
expression  matrix  of  dimension  (pxt),  we  obtain  two 
non-negative factors. Matrix W has size (pxt), which each 
of the  i columns defining the presence of probes in the 
isoform  i.  Matrix  H  has  size  (ix~,  representing  the 
expression level of isotorm i in the tissue t.  Therefore W

and H are equivalent to the probe-transcript matrix M and 
the transcript abundance matrix X,  respectively. 

However,  we  find  that  NMF  method  has  many 
drawbacks to apply for the junction array data.  Iterative 
optimization is not always robust and may fail occasionally. 
It is also sensitive to the experimental noise. NMF solution 
to Eq.  (2)  may not be unique - i.e.  random seeding may 
give  different  combinations  of  W  and  H.  Furthermore, 
many transcript models inferred from  NMF factorization 
have  unrealistic  structure.  In  an  effort  to  take  these 
problems into consideration, we decided to keep transcripts 
whose  exon  structure  is  consistent  with  any  ECgene 
models. Since ECgene is based on genomic alignment of 
mRNA  and  EST  sequences,  this  ensures  that  each 
isoform  model  in  subsequent  sections  has  supporting 
evidence  of  clones.  We  simply  examined  the  absent 
probes from the NMF-derived probe-transcript matrix to 
test the identity of NMF and ECgene models. 

NNLS  optimization  to obtain  isofonn abundance: The 
probe-transcript matrix is constructed using the resulting 
ECgene  transcripts  and  the  isoform  abundance  is 
deduced  from  the  non-negative  least  squares  (NNLS) 
fitting  of  experimental  data.  NNLS  method  solves 
"Ax=b'' in a least squares sense, under constraint "vector 
x  has  non-negative  elements'.  A  is  equivalent  to  the 
probe-transcript  matrix.  Two  vectors  (x  and  b)  are 
isoform  abundance  and  its  expression  intensity  in  a 
specific  tissue,  essentially  being  a  column  of  X  and  E 
matrices,  respectively.  The solution corresponds to the 
relative abundance of isoforms. 

A subtle problem of weighting arises in  NNLS fitting. 
Since  most  exons  are  constitutive  (not  showing  AS 
event),  there  exist  only  limited  number of  probes  with 
information on AS events.  It is desirable to increase the 
weight  of  those  informative  (AS-related)  probes.  For 
simplicity,  we  substituted  all  constitutive  probes  with  a 
hypothetical  probe  whose  expression  was  just  the 
average value. This allows that NNLS algorithm sensitively 
picks up the variation in isoform abundance. 

ResuHs and Discussion 
We  applied  our  method  to  three  genes  (OCRL 1, 
HMGCR,  and  APP)  whose  RT-PCR  and  sequencing 
results were reported by Johnson et a!.,  For these case 
studies,  we  used  the  ECgene  transcripts  whose  gene 
structure is the same with those in  the Johnson  et al.'s 
paper. 

OCRL 1 gene is known to have two isoforms as shown 
in  Fig.  4A.  Long  isoform  (NM_000276}  is  expressed  in 
retina and fetal brain, whereas a short form (NM_001587) 

is  observed  in  kidney  that  lacks  a  24-nt.  exon.  They 
confirmed the expectation from junction array data with 
RT-PCR experiment and sequencing. Our result agrees 
well with the experimental result. The intersection of gene 
model from the NMF and the ECgene transcripts found 2 
isoforms.  Variant #2 and #3 correspond to NM_000276 
and NM_001587, respectively. Table 1 shows the summary 
of our algorithm.  Long  isoform is expressed  in  all three 
tissues,  whereas the short one is pre-dominant form  in 
kidney and fetal brain. 

Johnson  et al.,  also  showed that the  junction  array 
data could predict novel isoforms for the case of HMGCR 
gene.  Only one isoform was  known at that point.  Their 
junction  array data clearly indicated alternative splicing 
of the 13-th exon as indicated in Fig. 48. Their RT-PCR 
result for this gene showed two bands in most of the 44 
tissues.  Our analysis  predicted that  two  isoforms were 
present in  46 tissues out of 52 tissue (data not shown). 
Furthermore,  NMF and  ECgene suggest another novel 
transcript with different first exon (isoform #1 ). The reality 
of this isoform should be 

Case study on  the  APP gene is  rather complicated. 
Johnson et al., found that it had three isoforms shown in 
Fig.  4C.  Two  isoforms  (NM_000484  and  X06989}  are 
present  in  most nonneuronal  samples,  e.g.,  melanoma 
and lung carcinoma. Exon 8 of NM_000484 is frequently 
missing in all brain tissues (X06989}. Additional exon 7 of 
NM_000484  is  skipped  in  fetal  brain  tissue  (Y00264}. 
Our  analysis  in  Table  2  seems  substantially  different 
from  their  result.  NMF and  ECgene  suggested  a  novel 
isoform  which  is  exactly  the  same  with  NM_000484 
except  the  first  exon.  This  can  happen  if  the  probe 
intensity for  the  junction  between  the  first  and  second

and NM_001587, respectively. B HMGCR gene. The variant #5 is the RefSeq NM_000859. The variant #2 is an unknown variant 
whose 13th exon (indicated as boxes) is being skipped. This exon skipping is obvious in the lower magnified view. C APP gene. It 
has three known splice variants (#5, #6, #7) whose accession numbers are NM_000484, X06989 and Y00264,  respectively. The 
third variant (#1  of HMGCR gene) in figure Band the first variant (#84 of APP gene) in figure Care novel isoforms that both NMF 
and ECgene models predicted. 

exons of NM_000484 is low compared to other constitutive 
probes. It remains to be seen if this new isoform is real or 
it  should  be  regarded  as  equivalent  to  the  RefSeq 
NM_000484.  Results for melanoma and lung carcinoma 
do not agree well with the RT-PCR result. 

The  APP  case  clearly  indicates  that  our  algorithm 
requires some improvements. There are many factors to 
take into consideration. Different hybridization efficiency 
of junction probes is the most serious problem. Conventional 
probe  sequences are  designed to  have similar melting 
temperatures. Since junction probes have limited freedom 
of sequence selection, their hybridization efficiency may 
be  vastly  different.  Method  to  estimate  hybridization 
efficiency  for  each  probe  is  essential  for  successful 
interpretation  of  junction  array  data.  Observed  probe 
intensities for constitutive exons could give some idea on 
different hybridization efficiency of each probe. Matrix W 
from  NMF  calculation  should  reflect  the  hybridization 
efficiency  too  in  ideal  situation.  One  can  calculate  the 

melting temperature from the probe sequence and  may 
be able to estimate the hybridization efficiency theoretically. 
One of these methods or an entirely different approach is 
imperative to overcome the problem of different hybridization 
efficiency in junction or exon array data. 

Another  critical  step  is  the  proper  selection  of 
isoforms. Almost all methods analyzing splice array data 
predict  alternative  splicing  at  the  exon 
level.  For 
example,  they  can  predict  a  specific  event  of  exon 
skipping fairly accurately. However, concurrent events at 
several  exons  should  be  correlated  to  predict  gene 
expression  at  the  isoform  level.  It  would  be  quite 
challenging  since  both  AS  and  different  hybridization 
affects the probe intensities simultaneously.  No method 
is  advanced  enough  to  deduce the  transcript structure 
from the microarray data yet. An iterative procedure that 
learns the hybridization affinity and AS events alternately 
may be developed to solve this problem. 

The problem of isoform selection can be alleviated as

the catalog of splice variants  becomes more complete. 
RefSeq  and  Ensembl  are  the  two  main  resources  for 
gene  structure.  Databases 
focused  on  alternative 
splicing  comprise  the  ASD,  AceView  and  ECgene. 
Adjusting weights for constitutive and alternative exons 
might  be  helpful  to  emphasize  the  effect  of  AS  in  the 
NNLS fitting step. 

Recently, several labs are trying to identify AS events 
using  the  so-called  splice  array that  contains  junction, 
exon  and  intron  intron  probes for a  single splice  event 
(Pan et at., 2004; Fehlbaum et at., 2005; Ule et at., 2005). 
Notably, Shai et at., developed GenASAP that predicted 
the levels of AS and the hybridization profiles simultaneously 
using  Bayesian  learning  in  an  unsupervised  probability 
model  (Shai  et at.,  2005).  Even  though  it  is  limited  to 
detect exon skipping events only,  its ability to learn the 
hybridization affinity may be applied to augment the NMF 
method. 

Conclusion 

We  developed  an  algorithm  that  predicts  the  isoform 
abundance  from  the  junction  array  data.  Unlike  other 
algorithms dealing with  individual AS event at the exon 
level, our method uses the NMF algorithm to obtain the 
transcript models consistent with the ECgene prediction. 
Then  the  relative  isoform  abundance  is  deduced  from 
the NNLS fitting of expression data. 

Recent development of human exon  chips from  the 
Affymetrix Inc. provides an exciting opportunity to examine 
transcription at the exon level on the genome-wide scale. 
It  contains  -1.4  million  probes  that  comprising  -4 
probes/exon and -40 probes/gene on average. Methods 
to analyze such type of data are urgently needed. 

Our method can be easily extended to other types of 
microarrays  with  exon  and junction  probes.  It  is just  a 
matter of defining the probe-transcript matrix according 
to the probe position in the transcript structure. However, 
it should be pointed out that the catalog of splice variants 
is not complete even with today's vast amount of mRNA 
and EST sequences in the GenBank. Methods that take 
the differential hybridization efficiency and identification 
of  novel  splice  variants  into  account  simultaneously 
should be developed in the near future.
