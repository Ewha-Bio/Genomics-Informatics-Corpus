Recent several studies have shown that the genetic variation of SCN5A is related with atrioventricular conduction block 
(AVB); no study has yet been published in Koreans. Therefore, to determine the AVB-associated genetic variation in Korean 
patients, we investigated the genetic variation of SCN5A in Korean patients with AVB and compared with normal control 
subjects. We enrolled 113 patients with AVB and 80 normal controls with no cardiac symptoms. DNA was isolated from the 
peripheral blood, and all exons (exon 2-exon 28) except the untranslated region and exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A 
gene were amplified by multiplex PCR and directly sequenced using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer. When a variation 
was discovered in genomic DNA from AVB patients, we confirmed whether the same variation existed in the control genomic 
DNA.  In  the  present  study,  a  total  of  7  genetic  variations  were  detected  in  113  AVB  patients.  Of  the  7  variations,  5 

(G87A-A29A, intervening sequence 9-3C＞A, A1673G-H558R, G3578A-R1193Q, and T5457C-D1819D) have been reported 

in previous studies, and 2 (C48G-F16L and G3048A-T1016T) were novel variations that have not been reported. The 2 newly 
discovered variations were not found in the 80 normal controls. In addition, G298S, G514C, P1008S, G1406R, and D1595N, 
identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected in this study. We found 2 novel genetic variations in the SCN5A 
gene in Korean patients with AVB. However, further functional study might be needed.

Introduction

The SCN5A gene, encoding a voltage-gated Na+ channel, 
is predominately expressed in the heart, where it has a key 
role in the generation and propagation of the cardiac impulse 
[1].

Voltage-gated Na+ channels are transmembrane proteins 
that produce the fast inward Na+ current responsible for the 
depolarization  phase  of  the  cardiac  action  potential. 
Inherited  variations  in  SCN5A,  the  gene  encoding  the 
pore-forming  α-subunit  of  the  cardiac-type  Na+  channel 
(Nav1.5), result in a spectrum of disease entities, termed 
Na+ channelopathies.

In many previous studies, lots of variations of the SCN5A 

gene have been observed in various cardiac diseases, such as 
long-QT  syndrome  (LQT),  Brugada  syndrome  (Brs),  pro-
gressive cardiac conduction defect, atrial fibrillation (AF), 
dilated cardiomyopathy, and overlapping syndromes [2, 3].
Recently, cardiac conduction system disease, manifesting 
as slower intramyocardial conduction and, in some cases, 
atrioventricular conduction block (AVB), has been related to 
SCN5A  mutation  [4].  Familial  AVB,  characterized  by 
progressive “degree of block” in association with variable 
apparent “site of block,” may be transmitted as an autosomal 
dominant trait. Two genetically distinct forms of AVB have 
been identified [5]. Brink et al. [6] established a genetic link 
between AVB and a genetic locus at chromosome 19q13, and 
Schott et al. [4] mapped AVB to chromosome 3p21.

Such genetic variations in AVB patients have been widely 
studied in Caucasians, Han Chinese, and Japanese, but no 
study has yet been published in Koreans as far we know. 
Therefore, we carried out a complete sequencing of coding 
regions of the SCN5A gene, except the untranslated region, 
in Korean AVB patients to investigate the SCN5A variations 
associated  with  AVB  and  compared  them  with  normal 
control subjects. This is the first study of SCN5A genetic 
variations  that  examined  all  coding  regions  in  Korean 
patients with AVB.

Methods
Patient enrollment

We  enrolled  113  Korean  AVB  patients  who  were 
diagnosed  with  electrocardiograms  and  who  had  inserted 
permanent  pacemakers  and  80  normal  controls  with  no 
cardiac symptoms. All patients and control subjects were 
recruited from four medical centers - Keimyung University, 
Yeungnam  University,  Catholic  University,  and  Fatima 
Hospital (Daegu, Korea) - from August 2009 to September 
2011.

This study was approved by the ethical committee at each 
hospital; consent was obtained from all individuals before 
enrollment into the study.

DNA extraction

In this study, peripheral blood was collected into ethylen-
ediamine  tetraacetic  acid-containing  tubes,  and  genomic 
deoxyribonucleic  acid  (DNA)  was  extracted  from  whole 
blood  samples  using  the  QIAamp  DNA  blood  mini  kit 
(Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentration was 
determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA), and 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  2,  2012

purity of the DNA was assessed based on the 260/280 nm 
absorbance ratio.

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
sequence analysis

The SCN5A gene is located on human chromosome 3p21, 
and the gene consists of 28 exons (Fig. 1) and encodes a 
protein of 2,016 amino acids with a molecular mass of 227 
kDa  [7].  Entire  coding  regions,  including  exon-intron 
boundaries of the SCN5A gene, were amplified by multiplex 
PCR-based direct sequencing. The primers for PCR amplifi-
cation  were  designed  based  on  the  GenBank  reference 
sequence;  primers  are  shown  in  Table  1.  PCR  conditions 
were as follows: an initial denaturation at 95oC for 15 min; 
and denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 68-70oC for 
30-60 s, and extension at 72oC for 60-90 s, repeated for 30 
cycles (Table 1). After multiplex PCR, the reaction mixture 
was electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel and stained with 
ethidium bromide (Fig. 2). Then, amplified PCR products 
were  purified  using  the  QIAquick  PCR  purification  kit 
(Qiagen)  and  directly  sequenced  using  the  BigDye 
Terminator ver 3.1 cycle sequencing kit on an ABI PRISM 
3100  Genetic  Analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City, 
CA, USA).

Sequencing  results  were  compared  with  the  reference 
sequences 
(SCN5A/NM_198056.2/ENSG00000183873/ 
ENST00000333535) using the alignment program BLAST 
2.0 of NCBI, and we determined the portion of variation that 
occurred. When a variation was discovered in genomic DNA 
from  patients,  we  confirmed  whether  the  same  variation 
existed in the control genomic DNA.

Results

In the present study, we sequenced all translated exons 

and exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A gene from 113 
Korean AVB patients. As a result, we identified 7 genetic 
variations (of these, 5 were known variations and 2 were 
novel  variations),  consisting  of  3  synonymous  (G87A- 
A29A,  G3048A-T1016T,  and  T5457C-D1819D),  3  non- 
synonymous (C48G-F16L, A1673G-H558R, and G3578A- 
R1193Q), and 1 splicing donor site of the intron 9-exon 10 
boundary (intervening sequence [IVS] 9-3C ＞ A) (Table 2).

The examples of the sequencing result are shown in Fig. 3. 
Among the 7 genetic variations, 2 single nucleotide poly-
morphisms  (SNPs)  have  been  reported  by  American  and 
Japanese  researchers:  non-synonymous  SNP  in  exon  12 
(rs1805124, A1673G-H558R) and synonymous SNP in exon 
28  (rs1805126,  C5457T-D1819D).  A1673G-H558R  was 
identified in 18% of the American populations (n = 71) and 
8%  of  the  Japanese  populations  (n  =  100)  [8,  9],  and 
C5457T- D1819D was observed in 12.3% of the American 
populations (n = 130) and 46% of the Japanese populations 
(n = 100) [9, 10]. We also discovered a synonymous SNP 
(rs6599230: G87A-A29A, in exon 2) and non-synonymous 
SNP (rs41261344, G3578A-R1193Q, in exon 20) that are 
very  common  polymorphisms  in  the  Han  Chinese  po-
pulation. In addition, we identified 2 novel variations that 
have not been previously reported. One of these variations 
was heterozygous synonymous (G3048A-T1016T), and the 
other  was  heterozygous  non-synonymous  (C48G-F16L). 
The genotype and allele frequencies of the identified genetic 
variations are summarized in Table 2. There were significant 
differences in the allele frequencies of A1673G-H558R and 
G3048A  (T1016T)  between  the  two  groups  (p  ＜ 0.05). 
There were no statistically significant differences in allele 
frequencies of the other genetic variations between the two 

groups (all p ＞ 0.05).

However, G298S [11], G514C [12], P1008S [13], G1406R 
[14],  and  D1595N  [11],  identified  in  other  ethnic  pop-
ulations,  were  not  detected,  and  A3075T-E1025D  and 
T4847A-F1616Y, discovered in 105 Korean sick sinus synd-
rome patients in our previous study, were also not detected 
in this study.

Next,  to  compare  with  normal  controls,  we  analyzed 
normal  samples  by  the  same  methods  whether  the  same 
variations existed in their genes. Just as in the patient group, 
4 SNPs (rs6599230, G87A-A29A; rs41312434, IVS9-3C ＞ 
A;  rs1805124,  A1673G-H558R;  rs1805126,  C5457T- 
D1819D) were detected in the normal control group, but 1 
non- synonymous SNP (rs41261344, G3578A-R1193Q) and 
2 novel variations (C48G-F16L and G3048A-T1016T) were 
not detected in the normal control group.

Discussion

This  is  the  first  case  report  with  genetic  variations  of 
SCN5A in Korean patients with AVB. To date, a number of 
SCN5A variations associated with various cardiac diseases, 
such as LQT, Brs, progressive cardiac conduction defect, AF, 
and overlapping syndromes, have been reported. Although

SCN5A genetic variations associated with AVB have been 
well studied in Caucasians, Han Chinese, and Japanese, no 
study has yet been published in Koreans as far we know. In 
previous  studies,  it  has  been  shown  that  in  some  cases, 
progressive AVB has been linked to SCN5A gene variations 

[4]. Furthermore, in our prior study, 2 novel variations were 
detected  in  Korean  sick  sinus  syndrome  (SSS)  patients, 
which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported 
in any ethnic group.

The  variations  could  be  significantly  associated  with

functional effects of the SCN5A gene. Based on these results, 
we searched for SCN5A genetic variations in Korean AVB and 
compared them with those of control subjects. The SCN5A 
gene consists of 28 exons and encodes a protein of 2016 
amino acids with a molecular mass of 227 kDa [7]. In our 
patients with AVB, there were 7 sites of nucleotide change 
from exon 2 to exon 28 of the SCN5A gene. Among of them, 
2 sites (G87A-A29A, IVS9-3C > A) were reported as genetic 
variations in a Western study [7], and T5457C- D1819D has 
already  been  reported  as  a  variation  or  polymorphism 
without functional effects on the channel in Asian studies [7, 
15, 16]. A1673G-H558R is located in the Na+ channel I, II 
interdomain  linker,  and  previous  functional  studies  have 
shown that the H558R-encoding minor allele can alter the 
phenotype of true disease-causing SCN5A mutations [17]. It 
has been suggested that it modulates Na+ channel functional 
changes  caused  by  other  variations  and  plays  a  role  in 
intragenic complementation [18, 19]. Previously, the H558R 
G allele has been associated with occurrence of early-onset 
AF and LQT interval in healthy populations. The H558R G 
allele frequency has been reported to be 20.4-32% in the 
white population, 29% in the black population, and 10.4% in 
the Chinese population. In our study, the G allele frequency 
of SCN5A mutation carriers was 8% and 13.1% in the normal 
control group. 

G3578A-R1193Q, which can cause a gain of the sodium 
ion  channel  function  and  cause  LQT3  and  Brs,  was  also 
found. It has been reported that G3578A-R1193Q confers a 
risk of LQT3 or Brs in the general population, although it 
seems to be a common polymorphism in the Han Chinese 
population.  Electrophysiological  studies  showed  that 
R1193Q  destabilizes  inactivation  gating  and  generates  a 
persistent, non-inactivating current, which results in a gain 
of the sodium channel function, as in LQT3 syndrome [20, 
21].

In  addition  to  previously  reported  variations,  we 
identified 2 novel variations that were not reported in the 
case  of  Japanese  and  Chinese  populations.  One  of  these 
variations  was  heterozygous  non-synonymous  (C48G- 
F16L),  and  the  other  was  heterozygous  synonymous 
(G3048A-T1016T).  Since  a  non-synonymous  nucleotide 
change in the SCN5A gene is likely to induce a functional 
change  in  the  sodium  channel,  a  non-synonymous  sub-
stitution  was  considered  a  candidate  for  the  variation 
associated  with  this  disorder.  In  this  study,  a  non-syno-
nymous variation, C48G-F16L, was not found in the normal 
control group but was detected only in the patient group, 
suggesting that it may effect AVB. However, G298S [11], 
G514C [12], P1008S [13], G1406R [14], and D1595N [11], 
identified in other ethnic populations, were not detected, 
thought to be due to very low frequency or no variation in the

Korean population.

In summary, our data may provide useful information for 
the identification of novel variations related to AVB, and the 
novel  variants  may  provide  useful  bio-markers  to  study 
Korean cardiac disease. 

In a future study, we will conduct a functional analysis of 
the novel variation (C48G-F16L) and propose a mechanism 
for its contribution to the AVB phenotype in patients. Also, 
we will try to find out genetic variation sites in other genes 
that might be responsible for AVB.
