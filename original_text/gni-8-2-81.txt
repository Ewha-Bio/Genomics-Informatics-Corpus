Abstract

for  association  with  pork  quality 

The  aim  of  the  study  was  to  investigate  pig  reference 
families,  generated  from  Korean  native  pigs  (KNP)  that 
were  crossed  with  Yorkshire  (YS)  breeds,  which  were 
used  to  evaluate  genetic  markers  to  select  breeding  ani-
mals  with  superior  pork  quality.  A  set  of  five  candidate 
genes  (PRKAG3, MC4R, CAST, ESR,  and  PRLR)  was 
analyzed 
traits. 
PRKAG3  (I199V)  SNP  genotypes  were  significantly  asso-
ciated  with  muscle  moisture,  protein,  and  fat  contents. 
The MC4R  D298N  polymorphism  was  significantly  asso-
ciated  with  meat  tenderness  and  color  traits.  The CAST 
polymorphism  was  significantly  associated  with  muscle 
moisture  and  crude  protein  traits.  These  three  genes 
have  been  associated  with  pork  quality  traits  in  other 
pig  populations,  and  some  of  our  results  are  consistent 
with  earlier  studies.  In  addition,  two  reproductive  candi-
date  genes  (ESR  and  PRLR)  did  not  have  significant 
associations.  These  results  suggest  that  further  study  is 
warranted  to  investigate  and  develop  more  DNA  mark-
ers  associated  with  pork  quality  in  our  KNP-crossed  pig 
families.

Introduction

Livestock  genome  research  has  evolved  remarkably  for 
identifying  molecular  mechanisms  underlying  quantitative 
traits,  such  as  growth  performance  and  meat  quality. 
Animal  breeders  and  geneticists  now  explore  genomics 
to  obtain  and  to  use  molecular  genetic  information  in

important 

traits  has  become 

selection  programs  for  superior  animals  with  desirable 
phenotypes.  With  the  consumer’s  interest  in  the  quality 
and  safety  of  meat  products,  the  genetic  control  of  pork 
quality 
in  the  swine 
industry.  However,  meat  quality  traits  are  measured  only 
after  the  slaughter  process,  so  the  animals  that  are  pro-
ven  to  have  superior  meat  quality  are  not  able  to  used 
directly  for  breeding  programs.  DNA  marker  technology 
enables  the  pig  breeder  to  monitor  and  predict  the  mo-
lecular  breeding  value  of  the  meat  quality  without 
slaughtering  animals. 
    For  identification  of  genetic  loci  or  DNA  markers  af-
fecting  pork  quality,  many  reference  pig  families  were 
generated  and  then  analyzed  for  association  between 
pork  quality  phenotypes  and  genotypes  (Rothschild  et 
al.,  2007).  A  substantial  number  of  candidate  genes 
have  shown  significant  associations  with  many  traits  im-
portant  to  swine  production.  Two  biological  candidate 
genes  (ESR  and PRLR)  have  shown  significant  associa-
tion  with  litter  size  (Short  et al.,  1997;  Tomas  et al., 
2006).  An  MC4R  mutation  has  shown  a  significant  re-
duction  in  feed  intake  with  less  fat  deposition  (Kim  et 
al.,  2000a;  Kim et al.,  2004).  Additional  important  genes, 
PRKAG3  and CAST,  have  been  shown  to  be  associated 
with  changes  in  pH  and  tenderness  (Ernst et al.,  1998; 
Ciobanu et al.,  2001).  Therefore,  in  this  study,  genotyp-
ing  and  association  analyses  of  5  SNPs  in  the  afore-
mentioned  genes  were  investigated  in  pig  reference 
families  generated  from  Korean  native  pig  (KNP)-crossed 
Yorkshire  (YS)  breeds,  with  the  objective  to  evaluate 
KNP  x  YS  families  as  a  reference  population  for  explor-
ing  and  identifying  genetic  markers  to  select  breeding 
animals  with  superior  pork  quality  and  to  understand 
genomic  mechanisms  underlying  pork  quality  variation 
between  KNP  and  YS. 

Methods

Animals 

A  three-generation  resource  population  was  developed 
from  reciprocal  crosses  between  the  Korean  native  pig 
(KNP)  and  Yorkshire  (YS)  breeds  at  Chungbuk  National 
University.  The  F1  crossbreeds  were  produced  from  two 
purebred  KNP  boars  crossed  with  five  purebred  YS 
sows  (F1:  KY)  as  well  as  three  purebred  YS  boars 
crossed  with  14  purebred  KNP  sows  (F1:  YK).  Randomly 
selected  F1  crossbreds  mated  to  produce  F2  animals 

82    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(2)  81-85,  June  2010

using  the  following  three  mating  systems:  1)  11  YK 
boars  were  intercrossed  with  46  YK  sows  (YK×YK);  2) 
5  KY  boars  were  intercrossed  with  19  KY  sows 
(KY×KY);  and  3)  5  KY  boars  were  intercrossed  with  7 
YK  sows  (KY×YK).  The  F2  pigs  were  raised  under  the 
same  feeding  and  management  practices,  and  in  total, 
750  pigs  were  performance-tested  and  349  randomly 
selected  pigs  were  slaughtered  at  age  190∼240  days 
(90∼110  kg  live  weight)  to  assess  the  meat  quality 

traits. 

Phenotypes

The  meat  quality  traits  included  crude  ash  (Cash),  crude 
protein  (Cpro),  crude  lipid  (intramuscular  fat,  IMF),  drip 
loss  (DL),  water  holding  capacity  (WHC),  moisture,  cook-
ing  loss  (CL),  shear  force  (shearforce),  pH  at  24  hrs 
(pH),  color  score,  marbling  score,  tenderness,  juiciness, 
flavor,  and  total  cholesterol  (Table  1).  These  traits  were 
measured  according  to  standard  methods  (Oh  et al., 
2008).

A  total  of  5  candidate  gene  polymorphisms  were  pre-
viously  reported,  and  detailed  information  about  these 
SNPs  and  their  respective  PCR_RFLP  genotyping  ap-
proaches  is  illustrated  in  Table  2.  Polymerase  chain  re-
actions  were  performed  in  10-μl  volumes,  containing 
12 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of each primer, 200  μM 
of  each  dNTP,  2.5  units  of  Taq  DNA  polymerase 
(Solgent,  Korea),  and  reaction  buffer  with  1.5  mM 
MgCl2.  The  thermocycling  reaction  was  performed  in  a 
PTC-200  thermocycler  (MJ  Research,  Watertown,  MA, 
USA)  with  a  10-min  initial  denaturation  at  95oC;  40  cy-
cles  of  95oC  for  30  s,  45∼65oC  for  30  s,  and  72oC  for 
40  s;  and  a  final  extension  at  72oC  for  5  min.  The  result 
of  the  PCR  reaction  was  identified  by  2%  agarose  gel 
electrophoresis  at  100  mV  for  20  min.  The  information 
for  each  primer  sequence,  annealing  temperature,  and 
fragment  size  is  given  in  Table  2.  All  restriction  enzymes 
were  supplied  by  New  England  BioLabs  (Ipswich,  MA, 
USA),  and  restriction  digests  were  performed  according 
to  the  manufacturer’s  recommendations.  Digested  PCR 
products  were  analyzed  on  2.5∼4%  agarose  gels,  and 
each  allele  was  scored  manually.  The  restriction  en-
zymes  and  polymorphic  fragment  sizes  used  for  SNP 
genotyping  are  given  in  Table  2.

Statistical  analysis 

A  goodness-of-fit  chi-square  test  was  used  to  test  for 
Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  by  comparing  the 
observed  number  of  subjects  for  each  genotype  with 
the  expected  number  of  subjects,  assuming  HWE;  geno-
type  distributions  were  tested  at  each  polymorphic  locus 
for  departure  from  HWE.  A  GLM  procedure  in  SAS 
(Version  9.01;  SAS,  Inst.,  Inc.,  Cary,  NC)  was  used  to 
analyze  the  association  of  SNP  marker  genotypes  of  the 
5  candidate  gene  polymorphisms  with  pork  quality  traits. 
The  linear  model  used  was  as  follows:

Yijk  =  u+Si+Gj+eijk

    where  Yijk  is  the  observation  for  each  trait,  u  is  the 
overall  mean  for  each  trait,  Si  is  the  fixed  effect  of  sex, 
Gj  is  the  fixed  effect  of  genotype,  and  eijk  is  the  random 
residual  effect.

Results  and  Discussion

Phenotypic  study

The  pig  traits  in  this  study  were  typical  traits  of  eco-
nomic  importance  to  the  pig  industry,  but  they  may 
have  applications  for  human  metabolic  conditions.  Table 
1  lists  the  means  and  standard  deviations  of  phenotypic 
variation  of  350  F2  animals  generated  from  KNP- 
crossed  YS  breeds.  The  meat  quality  characteristics 
were  affected  by  lipid  metabolism,  insulin  sensitivity, 
and  muscle  fiber  types;  thus,  they  certainly  have  im-
plications  for  diabetes  in  humans  (Tanner  et al.,  2002; 
He  et al.,  2001).  There  are  clear  genetic  (or  genomic) 
differences  in  the  meat  characteristics  between  KNP 
and  YS  breeds;  thus,  KNP-  and  YS-crossed  F2  animals 
have  expressed  a  large  quantitative  variation  in  these 
measured  traits.  It  has  been  reported  that  KNP  meat 
color  has  a  significantly  higher  redness  and  yellowness 
than  that  of  YS  meat  (Kim et al.,  2008).  Muscle-fat  con-
tent  (marbling  or  crude  lipid)  was  also  significantly  high-
er  in  KNP  animals,  but  water-holding  capacity  and  pH 

were  not  significantly  different  between  the  two  breeds 
(Kim  et al.,  2008).

Genotypic  frequencies  of  gene  polymorphisms

The  distribution  of  genotypic  and  allelic  frequencies  for 
the  analyzed  SNPs  is  listed  in  Table  3.  The PRKAG3  AA 
genotypic  animals  (199II)  constituted  only  2%  in  our  pig 
families.  The  pig  PRKAG3  gene  I199V  polymorphism 
was  reported  to  have  a  greater  effect  on  meat  quality, 
but  the  “favorable”  allele  199I  was  very  low  in  most 
other  pig  breeds,  except  for  the  Berkshire  pigs  (Ciobanu 
et al.,  2001;  Huang  et al.,  2004).
    The  MC4R  polymorphism  (D298N)  was  quite  poly-
morphic  in  the  KNP  x  YS  F2  animals.  Previous  studies 
have  shown  that  different  pig  breeds  have  a  different 
distribution  of  genotype  frequencies  (Bruun et al.,  2006; 
Kim  et al.,  2000b).  Bruun  et al.  (2006)  reported  a  sig-
nificant  increase  in  298N  allele  frequencies  in  Hamp-
shire,  Landrace,  and  Duroc  with  a  selection  program  for 
growth  rate.  It  was  also  reported  that  multiple  variants 
of  pig  MC4R  were  identified,  and  their  haplotypes  might 
have  originated  differently  among  pig  breeds  (Fan et al., 
2009).
    The  CAST,  ESR,  and  PRLR  gene  polymorphisms  ex-
isted  in  the  KNP  x  YS  F2  animals.  Several  CAST  poly-
morphisms  were  studied  in  Chinese  Jinpi  pigs  and 
found  to  be  completely  linked  in  the  Jinpi  pigs  (Wu  et 
al.,  2007). 

Association  of  genotypes  with  the  phenotypes

Association  results  at  significance  levels  (＜0.05)  are 
listed  in  Table  4.  Based  on  the  results,  the  PRKAG3 
(I199V)  SNP  genotypes  were  significantly  associated 
with  muscle  moisture,  protein,  and  fat  contents.  The 
PRKAG3  AA  genotype  animals  had  more  lipids  in  the 
muscle,  and  the  muscle  lipid  content  was  negatively 
correlated  with  muscle  moisture  content.  The  PRKAG3 
AA  animals  also  had  less  drip  loss,  which  means  higher 
water-holding  capacity.  Our  results  are  consistent  with 
previous  reports  in  which  the  AA  genotype  pigs  had

darker  meat  color  and  higher  pH  and  water-holding  ca-
pacity  (Ciobanu  et al.,  2001). 
    The MC4R  D298N  polymorphism  was  not  associated 
with  muscle  lipid  content  in  the  KNP  x  YS  F2  animals, 
but  the  polymorphism  was  significantly  associated  with 
meat  tenderness  and  color  traits.  The  MC4R  AA  geno-
type  animals  were  tender  and  darker  than  in  the  other 
genotype  animals.  Previous  studies  have  found  that 
MC4R  D298N  is  associated  with  fatness  and  growth 
rate  traits  in  many  pig  populations  with  different  genetic 
backgrounds  (Bruun  et al.,  2006;  Houston  et al.,  2004; 
Hernandez-Sanchez et al.,  2003;  Meidtner et al.,  2006). 
Unfortunately,  we  did  not  have  the  backfat  thickness  re-
cords  to  test  if  the  MC4R  D298N  polymorphism  was  as-
sociated  with  fat  deposition  traits  in  KNP  x  YS  F2  ani-
mals,  but  it  warrants  the  identification  of  the  MC4R 
gene  structure  in  KNP  pigs  to  investigate  the  functional 
mechanisms  of  obesity-related  phenotypes  (Barb et al., 
2010;  Switonski  et al.,  2010).
    The  CAST  RsaI  polymorphism  was  associated  with 
moisture  and  crude  protein  levels  (Table  4).  The  CAST 
FF  genotype  was  associated  with  less  moisture  and 
more  crude  protein  in  the  muscle,  and  these  results 
were  similar  with  results  in  the  Chinese  Jinpi  breed,  in 
which  the  FF  genotype  was  significantly  higher  in  the 
muscle  area  (Wu et al.,  2007).  We  did  not  find  an  asso-
ciation  of  tenderness  with  the  RsaI  CAST  polymorphism, 
but  almost  900  polymorphisms  were  detected  in  pig 
CAST  gene  sequences,  and  causative  mutation(s)  affect-
ing  pork  tenderness  might  exist  within  the  CAST  gene 
(Meyers  and  Beever,  2008).
    With regard to the ESR and PRLR gene polymorphisms, 
it  was  found  that  the  ESR  polymorphism  was  asso-

ciated  with  marbling  score,  which  is  a  subjective  meas-
urement  of  muscular  fat  level.  No  trait  association  was 
found  with  the  PRLR  polymorphism.  It  has  been  re-
ported  that  the ESR  Pvu  II  polymorphism  is  significantly 
associated  with  backfat  thickness  (Short  et al.,  1997). 
    From  the  present  study,  several  gene  polymorphisms 
that  are  known  to  be  associated  with  pork  quality  traits 
were  tested  in  KNP  x  YS  F2  animals.  Several  previous 
associations  were  confirmed,  but  it  is  suggested  that 
the  limited  sample  size  of  animals,  different  genetic 
backgrounds,  and  limited  candidate  genes  that  were 
studied  might  create  some  discrepancies  from  other 
studies.  Our  study  did  not  investigate  the  possible  inter-
actions  between  the  candidate  gene  polymorphisms  due 
to  the  limited  sample  size  of  the  animals.  Therefore,  ad-
ditional  work  is  warranted  with  more  animals  and  gene 
polymorphisms  to  develop  a  selection  program  using 
DNA  marker  information.
