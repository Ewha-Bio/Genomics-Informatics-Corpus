Gastritis is a common but a serious disease with a potential risk of developing carcinoma. Helicobacter pylori infection is 
reported as the most common cause of gastritis, but other genetic and genomic factors exist, especially single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms  (SNPs).  Association  studies  between  SNPs  and  gastritis  disease  are  important,  but  results  on  epistatic 
interactions  from  multiple SNPs are rarely found  in previous  genome-wide association (GWA) studies. In this  study,  we 
performed computational GWA case-control studies for gastritis in Korea Associated Resource (KARE) data. By transforming 
the resulting SNP epistasis network into a gene-gene epistasis network, we also identified potential gene-gene interaction 
factors that affect the susceptibility to gastritis.

Introduction

Gastritis is a common disease in Korea. There is a report 
that  9.9%  of  Koreans  have  gastritis  [1].  Gastritis  is 
associated  with  the  potential  risk  of  developing  gastric 
cancer  or  peptic  ulcer  disease  [2].  A  common  cause  of 
gastritis  is  Helicobacter  pylori  infection  [3].  However,  in 
addition to the cause, other genetic and genomic factors have 
been examined for gastritis. Human leukocyte antigen class 
II  allele  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  chronic  atrophic 
gastritis  and  gastric  carcinoma  in  Koreans  [4].  Moreover, 
many  studies  have  reported 
that  single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs), including rs1143627 in interleukin- 
1 beta (IL1B), rs4073 in interleukin 8 (IL8), rs4986790 in 
Toll-like  receptor  4  (TLR4),  and  rs16260  in  cadherin-1 
(CDH1), are associated with susceptibility to gastric diseases, 
especially gastric cancer [5-8].

The  results  from  SNP  studies  show  the  importance  of 
research for the association between SNP and disease, based 
on  the  association  and  functional  relationship  between 

gastritis and gastric carcinoma [9]. In other words, a casual 
SNP  in  one  disease  may  be  a  genetic  factor  for  another 
disease. However, previous studies only targeted the effect 
from each single variation; results have been rarely obtained 
for high-order genetic interactions in gastritis from genome- 
wide association (GWA) studies to date. 

In this study, we performed a GWA case-control study for 
gastritis using SNP genotype data of the Korea Associated 
Resource (KARE) project [10]. Our study was focused on 
detecting significant epistatic SNP-SNP interactions and the 
resulting  gene-gene  interactions  that  are  putative  causal 
factors in gastritis. A validation and functional analysis of the 
result was performed on the obtained relevance gene-gene 
epistasis network. 

Our  network  construction  method  is  based  on  the 
previous relevance network approach [11]. To measure the 
strength  of  the  association  between  a  pair  of  SNPs  and 
gastritis, we used the mutual information that has shown to 
be  effective  in  detecting  epistasis  in  case-control  GWA 
studies  [12,  13].  An  efficient  permutation  scheme  was 
adopted to extract significant interaction pairs, and we also

approximated  the  p-values  by  exploiting  the  relationship 
between the mutual information value and the 2 value [14]. 
We further transformed this SNP network into a relevant 
gene-gene  epistasis  network  to  validate  the  biological 
significance  of  our  findings.  A  functional  analysis  was 
performed on the gene-gene network, and the topological 
properties of the network were also investigated.

Methods
Pre-processing for KARE data

The KARE genotype data we used in the study initially 
consisted  of  352,228  SNPs  and  8,842  samples  after  the 
screening by genotype calling and quality control performed 
[10].  We  performed  the  following  additional  stages  of 
pre-processing.  First,  we  selected  case-control  samples 
based on the survey of the disease history of the patients, 
which was carried out in the KARE project. In the first stage, 
we collected 1,885 patients who self-reported that they had 
gastritis in the past as cases. We also found 4,117 individuals 
who self-reported that they had no history of having gastritis 
or any other diseases. Among those patients, we randomly 
selected 1,885 individuals as controls to avoid bias in the 
study. 

After the selection of case-control patients, we filtered out 
SNPs that corresponded to the following conditions: minor 
allele frequency ＜0.01 in each group [15], pairwise linkage 
disequilibrium r2 ＞ 0.8 [16], and SNPs in the X chromo-
some.  PLINK  [17]  was  used  for  the  calculation  of  these 
values. The resulting dataset consisted of 185,426 SNPs and 
3,770 samples for the case-control study.

Mutual information

We  used  mutual  information  measures  to  assess  the 
strength of the association between a pair of SNPs and the 
disease  status  of  gastritis.  Mutual  information  has  been 
widely  used  to  measure  dependence  or  independence 
between  two  random  variables  [11,  12,  18,  19].  It  is  a 
non-parametric measure and is able to detect both linear and 
non-linear  associations  [14].  This  measure  is  based  on 
Shannon’s entropy, H(X) = ∑x∈X − p(x)log(p(x)), which 
shows  the  uncertainty  of  the  random  variable  X.  Mutual 
information I(X;Y) between random variables X and Y is 
defined by the composition of entropy as follows:
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) − H(X,Y).

H(X), H(Y) denote entropies for the random variables X, Y, 
and H(X,Y) denotes the joint entropy of the two random 
variables as follows:

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

H(X,Y)=∑x∈X∑y∈Y − p(x,y)log(p(x,y)).

A  high  mutual  information  value  indicates  a  strong 
association between two random variables. The measure can 
also  be  extended  to  assess  the  strength  of  association 
between  a  pair  of  SNPs  and  a  phenotype.  The  extended 
version of mutual information is as follows: 
I(X1,X2;Y) = H(X1,X2) + H(Y) − H(X1,X2,Y),

where X1 and X2 are random variables for two SNPs, and Y 
denotes random variables for the disease. In our recent work 
[12],  we  have  shown  that  this  measure  could  identify 
high-order  epistatic  interactions  both  with  and  without 
marginal  effects  by  using  simulation  models,  such  as  in 
Culverhouse et al.'s [20] and Velez et al.’s studies [21].

As  the  genotype  and  disease  status  are  represented  as 
discrete values, it is more convenient to consider the random 
variables as a partition of the combination of the genotypes 
and disease status. Then, the entropy of a random variable X 
can be represented in terms of the partition as follows:



H(X) = 

  





log2

,

where X = {A1, A2, …, An} is a partition on the set of samples 
S = {A1∪A2∪…∪An}, and no intersections exist between 
elements in the partition. The joint entropy of two random 
variables for the partition of S, X = {A1, A2, …, An} and Y = 
{B1, B2, …, Bm} is defined as follows:

H(X,Y)=

.

The entropy also can be extended to the joint entropy of 

multiple random variables (e.g., 3 or 4 SNPs) naturally. 

Extraction of statistically significant epistatic 
interactions

As mentioned above, mutual information is a non-para-
metric  measure,  and  the  distribution  of  values  from  the 
population is unknown; therefore, it is difficult to show the 
statistical significance of values calculated by this measure. 
Rather  than  doing  the  computationally  too-expensive 
permutation  tests  for  every  pair  of  SNPs,  which  causes 
severe multiple testing issues when applied to GWA studies, 
we adopted the alternative permutation scheme proposed 
[11]. First, we replicated 30 permutations for disease status 
in  case-control  samples.  For  every  possible  pair  of  given 
SNPs, we calculated mutual information of SNPs with the 
permutated disease status labels and obtained the average

value from 30 replications.  denotes the maximum value of 
the averages. If a mutual information value between SNPs 
and the phenotype from real data is higher than , then we 
consider  that  the  pair  of  SNPs  shows  a  more  significant 
association with gastritis than a random association.

To  further  assess  the  statistical  significance  of  the 
identified SNP pairs, we approximated the p-values of the 
SNP pairs by exploiting the following relationship between 
2 value and mutual information [14]:

2 ∼ 2Nln2ㆍI(X1,X2;Y),

Relevance network construction and assessment of 
significance

Network analysis is a powerful tool to understand bio-
logical systems. Given the significant epistatic interactions 
between  SNP  pairs  and  disease  status  detected  by  the 
permutation  scheme,  we  constructed  SNP-SNP  epistatic 
interaction networks, where SNP represents the node and 
the significant interaction between SNP pairs represents the 
edge.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  assess  the  biological 
significance of the interaction networks directly because of 
the lack of interaction databases for SNPs. 

To  overcome  this limitation,  we directly mapped  these 

networks into a gene-gene relevance network. 

Fig.  1  represents  a  brief  scheme  of  how  to  map  the 
network. Suppose that some SNPs map directly to genes A 
and B, and there are at least two SNPs that have significant 
interactions for disease status. If one SNP maps to gene A 
and another SNP maps to gene B, then we consider that 
genes A and B have a unidirectional edge. The weight of the 
edge is defined by number of the interacting SNP pairs. For 
example, in Fig. 1, there are four SNP interactions between 
gene A and gene B. Thus, we consider that gene A and gene 
B have an edge, the weight of which is 4 in the gene-gene 
network. Finally, the top 5% edges having the largest edge 
weights are used in the biological validation and topological 
investigation.

We constructed a gene-gene network for each chromo-

some  showing  intra-chromosome  interactions.  We  mea-
sured the network topologies of each network using Cyto-
scape [22] and also ran a gene ontology (GO) enrichment 
analysis for sets of genes in the network. We used DAVID 
[23] to validate the biological significance of the networks.

study.

Results
Statistically significant epistatic interactions in each 
chromosome

We  ran  the  permutation  method  for  each  individual 
chromosome separately. As a result, we obtained SNP pairs 
that  were  non-randomly  associated  with  the  status  of 
gastritis for the given patients. 
Fig.  3  shows  the  number  of  such  SNP  pairs  for  each 
chromosome. We found that there were approximately 2%‒
4% associated pairs among all possible pairs in the chro-
mosomes.

We then calculated the p-value for each SNP pair by using 
the  approximation  scheme  [14]  and  under  Bonferroni 
correction [24]. Table 1 shows the number of statistically 
significant SNP pairs within each chromosome. Significant 
SNP pairs and p-values are listed in Supplementary Table 1. 
In total, 293 SNP pairs showed statistical significance in the 
study. Chromosomes 9 and 15 had many significant pairs, 
but many of those pairs included SNPs with marginal effects 
(rs169730 in chromosome 9, rs493971 in chromosome 15). 
There  were  few  significant  SNP  pairs  within  the  chro-
mosomes, and these pairs were not found in previous studies 
of gastric disease; therefore, further investigation of the pairs 
is needed to assess their biological significance.

Network topologies

Table 2 summarizes the results of the network topology 
measures  (number  of  nodes  and  edges,  clustering  coe-
fficient,  and  network  centralization)  for  the  gene-gene 
interaction network for each chromosome. The table shows 
that  all  chromosomes  showed  similar  properties:  the 
number of edges is 10‒30-fold higher than the number of 
nodes,  and  the  measurements  reveal  high  clustering 
coefficients and network centralization. 

Additionally,  every  network  from  each  chromosome 

consisted of only one component.

Figs. 4 and 5 present the structure of networks showing 
the highest values for the measures, especially the clustering 
coefficient and network centralization. 

In the real world, many biological networks show high 
average clustering coefficients [25]. The network in chro-

mosome 18 showed the highest clustering coefficient, and 
we found some hub genes in the network that were reported 
to be associated with gastric disease. For example, Uchino et 
al.  [26]  reported  frequent  loss  of  heterozygosity  at  the 
deleted  in  colorectal  carcinoma  (DCC)  locus  in  gastric 
cancer.

Higher network centralization values show that hub genes 
highly affect the network [27]. In other words, if the hubs are 
removed,  then  the  network  may  divide  into  several 
components. The network in chromosome 20 showed the 
highest value for the centralization measure. In the network 
receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase T (PTPRT), one 
of the hub genes was reported to be one of 15 genes in CpG 
islands  showing  significant  differential  methylation  in 
gastric carcinoma [28].

From the results, we determined that there were many 
close gene-gene interactions derived from SNP-SNP inter-
actions for gastritis and that if a gene had a high degree in the 
network, then this gene was connected to other genes with 
which it had frequent SNP-SNP interactions. We also found 
this tendency in most chromosomes.

Discussion

In this study, we applied a simple but powerful method to 
detect  epistatic  interactions  that  distinguish  gastritis 
patients from controls. We found several putative SNP-SNP 
interactions  using  the  mutual 
information  measure. 
Additionally, relevance gene-gene interaction networks that 
are derived from epistatic interactions show high clustering 
coefficients and centralization.

We  found  that  some  sub-networks  in  the  recovered 
network had biological significance for gastric disease from 
the GO enrichment analysis. However, we did not find these 
results  to  have  direct  associations  with  gastritis,  because 
gastritis has been less extensively studied than other gastric 
diseases,  such  as  gastric  cancer  or  ulcer.  We  expect  that 
future studies on gastritis will be necessary to validate the 
results from our study.

In this study, only intra-chromosome interactions were 
considered.  We  expect  that  if  we  extend  the  method  to 
inter-chromosomal analyses, this could increase the chances 
of finding novel sub-networks that are enriched in pathways 
for  gastritis.  However,  this  extension  will  impose  a 
computational  burden  and  increase  the  type  I  error; 
therefore, the development of a more flexible framework is 
needed to resolve this issue.
