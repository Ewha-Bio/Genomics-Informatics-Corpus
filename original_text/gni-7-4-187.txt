Abstract

Cytochrome  P450  2E1  (CYP2E1)  is  a  member  of  the  cy-
tochrome  P450  superfamily,  and  it  is  a  key  enzyme  re-
sponsible  for  the  metabolic  activation  of  many  small- 
molecular-weight  compounds  such  as  alcohol,  which  is 
classified  as  a  human  carcinogen.  In  this  study,  we 
identified  19  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in 
CYP2E1  in  Korean  population.  In  these  SNPs,  we  exam-
ined  possible  genetic  association  of  CYP2E1  polymor-
phisms  with  HBV  clearance  and  the  risk  of  hepato-
cellular  carcinoma  (HCC).  Five  common  polymorphic 
sites  were  selected,  CYP2E1  polymorphisms  at  rs381-
3867, rs3813870, rs2070673, rs2515641  and rs2480257, 
considering  their  allele  frequencies,  haplotype-tagging 
status  and  LDs  for  genotyping  in  larger-scale  subjects 
(n=1,092).  Statistical  analysis  demonstrated  that CYP2E1 
polymorphisms  and  haplotypes  show  no  significant  as-
sociation  with  HBV  clearance,  HCC  occurrence  and  on-
set  age  of  HCC  (p＞0.05).  Previous  studies,  however, 
have  shown  contradictory  findings  on  associations  of 
CYP2E1  polymorphisms  with  CYP2E1  activities  and 
HCC  risk.  Comparing  the  contrasting  results  of  previous 
researches  suggest  that  CYP2E1  polymorphism  is  asso-
ciated  with  CYP2E1  activity  induced  by  ethanol,  but  is 
not  directly  associated  with  HCC  risk.  CYP2E1 varia-
tion/haploype  information  identified  in  this  study  will  pro-
vide  valuable  information  for  future  studies  on CYP2E1.

Introduction

The  infection  of  hepatitis  virus  B  (HBV)  is  considered  as 
an  important  health  problem  worldwide  with  an  estima-
tion  of  350  million  people  chronically  infected  with  the 
disease  (Lavanchy,  2005).  Although  hepatic  complica-
tions  do  not  develop  in  most  chronic  hepatitis  B  car-
riers,  15%  to  40%  will  develop  liver  cirrhosis  (LC)  and 
hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  which  come  with  seri-
ous  sequelae  during  their  lifetime  (Bosch  et al.,  2005).
    Continuous  consumption  of  more  than  80g  of  ethanol 
everyday  for  a  period  longer  than  10  years  increases  the 
risk  of  HCC  by  approximately  fivefold;  however,  con-
sumption  of  less  than  80g  of  alcohol  per  day  does  not 
significantly  increases  the  risk  of  HCC  (Morgan  et al., 
2004).  Although  the  development  of  alcohol  related  to 
HCC  involves  several  factors  including  the  presence  of 
cirrhosis,  oxidative  stress,  disturbed  DNA  methylation, 
and  defective  retinoic  acid  signaling,  the  precise  mecha-
nisms  on  how  alcohol  causes  HCC  at  a  molecular  level 
are  just  beginning  to  emerge  (Seitz  &  Stickel  2007; 
Stickel  et  al.,  2002).  According  to  the  International 
Agency  for  Research  on  Cancer,  ethanol  is  classified  as 
a  human  carcinogen  because  it  induces  HCC  in  animals 
and  increases  the  risk  for  developing  HCC  in  humans 
(Baan  et al.,  2007;  Seitz  and  Stickel  2007).
    Cytochrome  P450  2E1  (CYP2E1),  a  member  of  the 
cytochrome  P450  superfamily  is  important  for  the  meta-
bolic  activation  of  many  low-molecular-weight  toxicants 
such  as  N-nitrosamines,  aniline,  vinyl  chloride,  urethane 
and  alcohol  (Guengerich et al.,  1991).  The  participation 
of  CYP2E1  in  the  ethanol  metabolizing  process  is  less 
important  than  alcohol  dehydrogenase  (ADH)  and  alde-
hyde  dehydrogenase  (ALDH).  However,  continuous  etha-
nol  consumption  is  known  to  increase  the  activity  of 
CYP2E1  up  to  20  fold,  a  major  constituent  of  the  micro-
somal  ethanol  oxidizing  system  in  the  liver  (Stickel  & 
Osterreicher  2006;  Takahashi et al.,  1993).  Therefore,  al-
cohol’s  metabolizing  capacity  is  increased  in  heavy 
drinkers.  Moreover,  CYP2E1  often  catalyze  the  metabol-
ic  activation  of  various  procarcinogens  to  eventual  carci-
nogens  (Guengerich  et al.,  1991;  Koop,  1992).
    Genetic  variation  appears  to  contribute  to  interindivi-
dual  variation  in  CYP2E1  expression  levels  and  activities 
(McCarver et al.,  1998).  Specifically,  RsaI  polymorphism 
(CYP2E1*5B) (rs2031920)  has  been  associated  with  de-
creased  CYP2E1  activity  or  inducibility  (Hayashi  et al., 
1991;  Lucas  et  al.,  1995;  Marchand  et  al.,  1999; 

188    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(4)  187-194,  December  2009

Watanabe  et  al.,  1994).  Functional  CYP2E1  poly-
morphisms  might  therefore  influence  on  susceptibility  to 
cancer  development.  In  one  study,  common  genotypes 
were  associated  with  risk  of  HCC  (Yu et al.,  1995).  On 
the  other  hand,  increased  risk  of  HCC  was  observed 
with  the  rare  genotype  carriers  in  another  study  (Ladero 
et al.,  1996).  These  studies  suggest  that  variation  of 
CYP2E1  can  influence  individual’s  risk  of  HCC.
    Based  on  these  studies,  we  have  formed  a  hypoth-
esis  that  polymorphisms  of  CYP2E1  can  affect  HCC 
progression  among  HBV-infected  patients  and  therefore 
performed  a  screening  of CYP2E1  to  examine  its  genet-
ic  association  with  HBV  clearance  and  HCC  progre-
ssion.

Methods

Subjects

A  total  number  of  1,092  Korean  subjects  having  either 
present  or  past  evidence  of  HBV  infection  were  pro-
spectively  enrolled  from  the  outpatient  clinic  of  the  liver 
unit  or  from  the  Center  for  Health  Promotion  of  Seoul 
National  University  Hospital  from  January  2001  to 
August  2003.  All  the  study  subjects  were  of  Korean 
ethnicity.  Subjects  were  classified  into  two  different 
groups:  CC  (chronic  carrier)  and  SR  (spontaneously  re-
covered),  according  to  serological  markers.  The  CC  and 
SR  cohorts  consisted  of  658  and  434  subjects,  re-
spectively,  and  the  CC  cohort  was  composed  of  338 
CH/LC  and  320  HCC  patients  (Table  1).  The  diagnoses 
of  the  CC  and  SR  subjects  were  established  by  re-
peated  seropositivity  for  the  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen 
  HBsAg  5.0;  Dade  Behring,  Mar-
(HBsAg)  (Enzygnost
burg,  Germany)  over  a  six-month  period,  and  for  both 
Ⓡ
  Anti-HBs  II;  Dade  Behring,  Mar-
anti-HBs  (Enzygnost
burg,  Germany)  and  anti-HBc  (AB-Corek;  DiaSorin  s.r.l., 

Ⓡ

Saluggia,  Italy)  of  the  IgG  type  without  HBsAg,  respec-
tively.  We  excluded  subjects  that  were  positive  only  for 
anti-HBs  and  not  for  anti-HBc,  and  those  positive  for 
Ⓡ
;  Greencross  Life  Sci-
anti-HCV  or  anti-HIV  (GENEDIA
Ⓡ
3.2;  Dong-A  Phar-
ence  Corp.,  Yongin-shi,  Korea,  HCV
maceutical  Co.,  Seoul,  Korea).  Subjects  whose  average 
alcohol  consumption  assessed  by  interview  was  ＞510 
g/day  or  average  cigarette  smoking  was  ＞1  pack/day 
were  excluded.  Patients  who  had  any  other  types  of  liv-
er  diseases  such  as  autoimmune  hepatitis,  toxic  hep-
atitis,  biliary  cirrhosis  and  Budd-Chiari  syndrome  were 
also  excluded.  No  patients  in  our  study  had  a  previous 
history  of  immunosuppression  or  anti-viral  treatment.
    Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  each  patient, 
and  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Human  Research 
at  Seoul  National  University  Hospital  approved  the  study 
protocol.  All  the  patients  in  the  CC  group  had  been  on 
regular  medical  follow-up  and  had  been  evaluated  with 
serum  alpha-fetoprotein  level  assessment,  abdominal  ul-
trasonography,  and/or  2-phase  spiral  liver  CT  scan  more 
than  twice  a  year  to  detect  early  stages  of  HCC.  We  al-
so  performed  abdominal  MRI,  bone  scan,  chest  CT, 
brain  MRI,  brain  CT,  hepatic  angiography  or  PET  scan 
in  some  patients  according  to  the  clinical  decisions. 
Liver  cirrhosis  was  diagnosed  pathologically  or  by  the 
clinical  evidences  of  portal  hypertension  such  as  visible 
collateral  vessels  on  the  abdominal  wall,  esophageal 
varices  on  esophagogastroscopy,  palpable  splenome-
galy  and  sonographically  definite  findings  of  cirrhotic  liv-
er  or  ascites.  HCC  was  diagnosed  as  described  pre-
viously  (the  age  of  onset  was  determined  by  the  date  of 
the  diagnosis.)  (Bruix  et al.,  2001).

Bank  sequences  (Ref.  Genome  seq.;  NT_008818.16). 
Sequence  variants  were  verified  by  chromatograms.

Genoyping with Fluorescence Polarization Detec-
tion

For  genotyping  of  polymorphic  sites  in  our  HBV  study, 
amplifying  primers  and  probes  were  designed 
for 
TaqMan  (Livak,  1999).  One  allelic  probe  was  labeled 
with  the  FAM  dye  and  the  other  with  the  fluorescent  VIC 
dye  for  TaqMan  probes.  Information  regarding  the  pri-
mers  is  attached  in  Table  2.  Primer  Express  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA)  was  used  to  design  the 
MGB  TaqMan  probes.  PCRs  were  run  in  a  TaqMan 
Universal  Master  Mix  without  UNG  (Applied  Biosystems), 
with  PCR  primer  concentrations  of  900  nM  and  TaqMan 
MGB-probe  concentrations  of  200  nM.  Reactions  were 
performed  in  a  384-well  format  in  a  total  reaction  vol-
ume  of  5  ml  using  20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The  plates 
were  then  placed  in  a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9700,  Applied 
Biosystems)  and  heated  at  50oC  for  2  min  and  95oC  for 
10  min,  followed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  15  s  and 
60oC  for  1  min  with  a  final  soak  at  25oC.  The  TaqMan 
assay  plates  were  transferred  to  the  Prism  7900HT  in-

strument  (Applied  Biosystems)  where  the  fluorescence 
intensity  in  each  well  of  the  plate  was  read.  Fluore-
scence  data  files  from  each  plate  were  analyzed  by  au-
tomated  allele-calling  software  (SDS  2.1).

Statistics

We  searched  for  a  spine  of  strong  |D’|  and  LD  co-
efficient  r2  between  all  pairs  of  biallelic  loci  (Hedrick  & 
Kumar,  2001).  Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  was  inferred 
using  the  algorithm  developed  by  the  Broad  Institute(us-
ing  the  program  Haploview)  (Barrett et al.,  2005).  Haplo-
types  of  each  individual  were  inferred  using  the  algo-
rithm  (PHASE,  version  2.0)  developed  by  Stephens et al. 
(Stephens et al.,  2001).  Subjects  harboring  missing  gen-
otypes  were  omitted  in  the  analysis  of  individual  sin-
gle-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  and  haplotypes. 
The  genotyping  success  rate  was  ＞99%,  so  it  is  un-
likely  that  omitting  a  small  number  of  individuals  in-
troduced  any  bias  in  the  analysis.  For  analysis  of  viral 
clearance  as  an  outcome,  logistic  regression  models 
were  used  for  calculating  odds  ratios  (95%  confidential 
interval)  and  corresponding  p-values  controlling  for  age 
(continuous  value)  and  sex  (male=0,  female=1)  as  cova-
riates.  HBV  genotypes,  HBV  DNA  and  Alanine  trans-
aminase  (ALT)  levels  have  been  regarded  as  important 
factors  influencing  HBV  clearance  and  the  development 
of  HCC.  However,  HBV  genotype  C  is  predominant 
among  CCs  of  the  virus  in  Korea  (Bae  et al.,  2005; 
Odgerel  et al.,  2003;  Song  et al.,  2005a;  Song  et al., 
2005b;  Yoo  et al.,  2003),  and  the  HBV  DNA  and  ALT 
levels  were  found  to  be  fluctuating  during  the  follow-up 
for  the  majority  of  our  HBV  cohort.  Therefore,  logistic 
models  for  HBV  clearance  were  adjusted  only  for  age 
and  sex.  Statistical  power  is  calculated  with  PGA  (Po-
wer  for  Genetic  Association  Analyses)  matlab  application 
(Menashe  et  al., 
(http://dceg.cancer.gov/bb/tools/pga) 
2008).  PGA  is  an  application  specifically  designed  to 
calculate  statistical  power  and  other  values  of  case-con-
trol  genetic  association  studies.  For  the  present  study, 
a  co-dominant  (1df)  model  with  relative  risk  1.3,  disease 
prevalence  value  7.1%  (Lee et al.,  1998),  EDF  (Effective 
Degree  of  Freedom)  2,  and  alpha  error  level  5%  were 
used  to  calculate  the  statistical  power  of  p-values  for 
HBV  clearance  and  HCC  occurrence.

Results

In  this  study,  we  examined  the  association  of  CYP2E1 
polymorphisms  with  persistent  HBV  infection  and  HCC 
occurrence.  By  direct  sequencing  of  24  individuals,  we 
identified  19  sequence  variants  in  the CYP2E1:  8  in  the 
promoter,  3  in  coding  regions  of  exons  (two  non-synon-

Table  3).  We  analyzed  five  polymorphisms  (rs3813867, 
rs3813870, rs2070673, rs2515641 and rs2480257)  in 
CYP2E1.  These  were  selected  for  larger-scale  genotyp-
ing  (n=1,092)  by  considering  their  allele  frequencies, 
haplotype-tagging  status,  and  LDs.  The  minor  allele  fre-
quencies  of  the  SNPs  in  Korean  population  were;  0.181 
(rs3813867),  0.202  (rs3813870),  0.381  (rs2070673),  0.157 
(rs2515641)  and  0.392  (rs2480257)  (Fig.  1A,  Table  3). 
Genotype  distributions  of  all  loci  were  in  Hardy-Wein-
berg  equilibrium  (p＞0.05),  except  for  rs3813867  (p
＜0.05,  Table  3).  Five  SNPs  showed  low  LDs  (Fig.  1C), 
and  four  major  haplotypes  accounted  for  over  97.8%  of 
the  distribution  (Fig.  1B).
    Association  analyses  of  HBV  clearance  (HCC/LC/CH 
vs.  SR)  and  HCC  occurrence  (HCC  vs.  CH/LC)  for  each 
polymorphism  and  haplotype  of  the  CYP2E1  were  per-
formed  using  logistic  regression  models  (Table  4),  con-

trolling  age  and  sex  as  covariates  (gender  and  age  were 
significantly  associated  with  HBV  clearance;  p＜0.05, 
data  not  shown)  in  our  Korean  HBV  study.  The  stat-
istical  powers  for  each  polymorphism  are  also  shown  in 
Table  4.  In  the  analysis,  CYP2E1  polymorphisms  and 
haplotypes  did  not  show  significant  associations  with 
HBV  clearance  and  the  HCC  occurrence  (p＞0.05,  Table 
4).  The  role  of CYP2E1  polymorphisms  in  onset  age  of 
HCC  was  also  analyzed  using  Cox  relative  hazards 
model  among  chronic  HBV  patients  (Table  4).  However, 
no  significant  genetic  effect  was  observed  afterwards 
(p＞0.05,  Table  4).

Discussion

In  the  present,  HCC  is  one  of  the  most  common  tumors 
among  the  prevalent  malignant  tumors  worldwide  (El- 
Serag  &  Mason,  2000).  The  increase  in  HCC  occurrence

1p-values  of  deviation  from  Hardy-Weinberg  Equilibrium  (HWE)  among  Korean  subjects.
Bold  face  means  SNPs  genotyped  in  a  larger  population  (n=1,092)  and  plain  faces  were  based  on  the  sequencing  data 
(n=24).

is  most  likely  due  to  the  more  widespread  chronic  in-
fection  with  HBV.  The  virus-host  interactions  might  influ-
ence  different  disease  outcomes  of  HBV  infections  (Cruz 
et al.,  1987).  However,  knowledge  of  the  host  genetic 
factors  involved  in  the  progress  of  HBV  infection  and 
HCC  occurrence  is  insufficient  now.  CYP2E1,  an  ethanol 
inducible  enzyme,  is  one  of  the  candidate  genes  that 
might  influence  the  outcome  of  chronic  liver  disease. 
Moreover,  acetaldehyde,  a  highly  toxic  and  volatile  com-
pound  is  the  first  intermediate  of  alcohol  metabolism  by 
CYP2E1  (Peters  &  Ward,  1988).  Therefore,  the  level  of 
CYP2E1  might  increase  cancer  risk.

    Many  researches  have  been  focused  on  polymor-
phisms  of  the  CYP2E1.  There  are  many  known  poly-
morphic  loci  in  the  CYP2E1.  Among  these  polymor-
phisms,  RsaI  polymorphism  (CYP2E1*5B)  (rs2031920) 
has  been  associated  with  higher  transcription  and  incr-
eased  enzyme  activity  and  is  located  at  5’  regulatory  re-
gion  (Grove et al.,  1998;  Hayashi et al.,  1991;  Tsutsumi 
et al.,  1994).  RsaI  polymorphism  is  associated  with  alco-
holic  liver  disease  in  Asian  population  (Piao et al.,  2003; 
Tanaka  et al.,  1997;  Tsutsumi  et al.,  1994).  Likewise, 
some  studies  show  that  CYP2E1  polymorphism  were 
associated  with  risk  of  HCC  (Ladero et al.,  1996;  Yu et

    In  this  study,  we  hypothesized  that  polymorphisms  of 
CYP2E1  can  affect  HCC  Risk  in  HBV  patient.  We  ana-
lyzed  five  polymorphisms  of  CYP2E1  via  genotyping  a 
total  of  1,092  samples,  including  658  chronic  carrier  and 
434  spontaneously  recovered  individuals.  However,  our 
research  revealed  that  the  five  polymorphisms  and  hap-
lotypes  in  CYP2E1  are  not  associated  with  HBV  clear-
ance,  HCC  occurrence  and  onset  age  of  HCC  in  a 
Korean  population.
    Some  of  the  previous  studies  have  shown  findings  on 
CYP2E1  polymorphism  associations  with  CYP2E1  activ-
ities  and  HCC  risk  (Hayashi et al.,  1991;  Ladero et al., 
1996;  Lucas et al.,  1995;  Marchand et al.,  1999;  Wata-
nabe et al.,  1994;  Yu et al.,  1995).  However,  other  pre-
vious  studies  have  reported  that  there  was  no  associa-
tion  between  CYP2E1  genetic  polymorphisms  and 
CYP2E1  activities  (Carriere  et al.,  1996;  Inoue  et al., 
2000;  Powell et al.,  1998).  In  other  words,  including  the 
findings  of  this  study,  the  literature  have  shown  contra-
dictory  findings  on  associations  of CYP2E1  polymorphi-
sms  with  CYP2E1  activities  and  HCC  risk,  especially 
rs3813867  polymorphism  which  is  in  absolute  linkage 
disequilibrium  (LD)  (|D’|=1  and  r2=1)  with  RsaI  poly-
morphism  (CYP2E1*5B)  (rs2031920),  which  is  associated 
with  higher  transcription,  increased  enzyme  activity,  and 
alcoholic  liver  disease  (Grove  et al.,  1998;  Hayashi  et 
al.,  1991;  Piao  et  al.,  2003;  Tanaka  et  al.,  1997; 
Tsutsumi  et al.,  1994).
    When  comparing  the  contrasting  results  of  previous 
researches,  we  can  find  different  statistical  methods  and 
patient  group  in  the  researches.  Positive  result  studies 
used  a  method  of  classification  by  physiological  deter-
minants,  especially  drinking  and  smoking  habits.  Howev-
er,  negative  result  studies  only  performed  a  case-control 
analysis  without  classifying  according  to  alcohol  con-
sumption.  Moreover,  a  previous  study  has  shown  that 
the  activity  of CYP2E1  is  modulated  by  various  physio-
logical  determinants,  such  as  obesity  (O'Shea  et al., 
1994),  fasting  (O'Shea et al.,  1994),  and  liver  dysfunction 
(Dilger  et al.,  1997),  and  can  be  induced  by  ethanol 
(Girre  et al.,  1994).  In  contrast,  dietary  isothiocyanates 
(Leclercq  et al.,  1998),  and  garlic  (Reicks  and  Crank-
shaw,  1996;  Yang et al.,  1994),  as  well  as  some  drugs, 
such  as  disulfiram  (Kharasch et al.,  1993),  and  chlorme-
thiazole  (Gebhardt et al.,  1997),  inhibit CYP2E1  activity. 
Therefore,  we  can  estimate  that  RsaI  polymorphism  is 
not  associated  with CYP2E1  activity,  but  rather,  is  asso-
ciated  with  inducement  of CYP2E1  activity  by  gene-en-
vironment  interactions,  including  links  with  ethanol  con-
sumption.  Moreover,  the  increase  of  CYP2E1  activity 
may  be  associated  with  increase  of  alcoholic  liver  dis-

ease  risk  resulting  in  increased  formation  of  ROS 
(Hayashi et al.,  1991;  Tsutsumi et al.,  1994).  This  means 
that  the  findings  from  previous  studies,  which  suggested 
that  variation  of CYP2E1  can  influence  the  risk  of  HCC, 
is  due  to CYP2E1  activity  change  by  ethanol  consump-
tion.  In  other  words,  we  can  presume  that  if  the  influ-
ence  of  environmental  factors  would  have  been  be 
same,  then  there  would  be  no  association  signals  for 
the  polymorphisms.  We  can  presumption  that  CYP2E1 
polymorphism  is  associated  with  CYP2E1  activity  in-
duced  by  ethanol,  but  is  not  directly  associated  with 
HCC  risk.  However,  we  can  estimate  another  hypoth-
esissuggesting  that  this  contradictory  result  may  be  af-
fected  by  racial  differences.  Additional  studies  are  need-
ed  to  clarify  the  association  of  CYP2E1  with  HCC  risk 
in  other  ethnic  populations.
if 
    In  conclusion, 
CYP2E1  may  have  important  functions  in  the  HBV  clear-
ance  and/or  HCC  occurrence,  genetic  variants  of 
CYP2E1  in  this  study  probably  do  not  influence  HBV 
clearance  and/or  HCC  occurrence.  Although  we  could 
not  find  any  significant  associations,  the  information 
from  this  research  would  be  useful  for  host  genetic 
studies  of  CYP2E1  related  diseases,  including  HCC. 
Moreover,  CYP2E1  novel  polymorphisms,  which  were 
identified  in  our  research,  will  be  useful  for  studies  on 
alcohol  related  diseases.
