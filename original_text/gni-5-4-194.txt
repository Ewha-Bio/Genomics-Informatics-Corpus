Abstract
We  have  constructed  the  Rice  Genome  Information 
Service System (RGISS), which is an information service 
system of the Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica (rice) genome, 
using the released version of rice Build 3.0 pseudomolecules 
based on the Ensembl architecture. The nonredundant 
library, composed of 3,360 clones of BACs, PACs, and 
fosmids, was used to construct supercontigs.

RGISS  contains  50,717  annotated  genes  from 
GenBank, 56,161 predicted genes from FgeneSH, and 
information on 9,587 markers, which includes STS, SSR, 
and EST-based RFLP. The 20,180 ESTs sequenced by 
the Korea National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology 
(NIAB) were aligned and mapped into 168,792 exons. By 
gene ontology analysis, the classified protein numbers in 
the rice genome were 6158, 4531, and 12,364 proteins, 
which  were  mapped  to  molecular  function,  cellular 
component, and biological process, respectively.

Availability:  RGISS  is  accessible  via  the  web  site  of 
Korea  National  Institute  of  Agricultural  Biotechnology 
(http://ensembl.niab.go.kr:8080/).

Introduction
The  International  Rice  Genome  Sequencing  Project 
(IRGSP)  was  established  in  1998  with  the  aim  of 
sequencing the entire rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. japonica) 
genome (Sakata K. et al., 2002), the size of which is around

430 Mb, the smallest among the major cereal crops. 

NIAB has participated in the IRGSP with the Korea Rice 
Genome Research Program, the role of which was to 
determine sequences in a few regions of rice chromosome 
1 (151.4-160cM) and chromosome 9 (68.2-77.7cM, 93.2- 
94.4cM).

As NIAB has participated in the IRGSP, its own rice 
genome information service system has been required to 
accommodate  NIAB-specific  research  needs  such  as 
mapping in-house ESTs to the rice genome, as well as acting 
as the information service of the data provided by IRGSP. 
To address these needs, the Rice Genome Information 
Service  System  (RGISS)  has  been  developed.  The 
Ensembl  (www.ensembl.org)  system  was  applied  to 
display rice genome information, as it provides data to 
many  viewers,  from  chromosome  maps  to  detailed 
information of proteins. Scattered information of the rice 
genome, which includes annotated data from GenBank, 
gene prediction data from IRGSP, marker data, and EST 
data  from  NIAB,  were  aligned  against  chromosome 
sequences by IRGSP. Parsing programs were implemented 
to  analyze  annotated  information,  and  calculation 
programs  were  implemented  to  compare  and  map 
sequence data. All data were converted into Ensembl 
database schema, and Ensembl viewers were adjusted 
to visualize them.

Results and Discussion
The  annotation  data  for  4092  clones  (BACs/PACs/ 
fosmids) from IRGSP and GenBank were analyzed to find 
duplicated clones. Three thousand three hundred sixty 
clones selected after removing redundancy were aligned 
against Build 3.0 pseudomolecules of 12 chromosomal 
sequences, which were provided by IRGSP, to calculate 
their physical positions. 

The physical positions of the genes in the clones were 
calculated after the clones were aligned against Build 3.0 
pseudomolecules.  The  mRNA,  protein,  function,  and 
locus  data  were  extracted  from  annotation  data,  and 
50,717 genes, 193,605 exons, and 50,717 transcripts 
were extracted from 3360 clones.

The  information  on  56,161  genes  in  Build  3.0 
pseudomolecules, which were predicted using FgeneSH 
(Salamov A. et al., 2000) from IRGSP, was also integrated 
into RGISS.

Nine thousand five hundred eighty-seven markers, 
composed of 6586 EST based RFLP, 62 STS, and 2939 
SSR, were incorporated into RGISS after their alignment 
against the 12 rice chromosomes.

The 20,180 ESTs sequenced by NIAB were aligned 
against  the  pseudomolecules  using  a  local  alignment 
search program, SIM4 (Florea L. et al., 1998), to find out 
their  expression  positions.  They  were  mapped  into 
168,792 exons (averaging eight exons per one EST) and 
were distributed throughout entire chromosome.

By gene ontology analysis (Harris M.A. et al., 2004), the 
classified protein numbers in the rice genome were 6158, 
4531 and 12,364 proteins, which were mapped to molecular 
function,  cellular  component,  and  biological  process, 
respectively.  Among  50,717  annotated  genes,  23,053 
proteins were mapped to GO categories, which means that 
the rice genome project is in the beginning stages and needs 
much more research for protein function analysis. 

RGISS  also  provides  several  additional  services. 
There  are  Rice  SNPView  (SNP  information  display), 
AlignView  (sequence  alignment  view),  TextView  (text 
search), MartView (text generation for genes, clones, and 
markers), and BLASTView (homology search with rice 
chromosome sequences using BLAST). 

The  main  purpose  of  RGISS  construction  was  to 
incorporate in-house raw data and analysis data, as well 
as to integrate public rice genome information. EST and 
full-length cDNA data, which are based on real expression 
experiments, are very helpful for researchers to investigate 
the precise positions of genes, as well as to validate the 
accuracy of gene prediction programs such as GenScan 
(Burge C. et al., 1997) or FgeneSH. Through RGISS, the 
rice ESTs sequenced by NIAB can be accessible not only 

to the in-house research group but also to the public.

NIAB plans to integrate the full-length cDNA information 
generated by NIAB research teams and KOME  (Knowledge- 
based Oryza Molecular biological Encyclopedia) into RGISS 
in the near future (Kikuchi S. et al., 2003).

RGISS  is  expandable  in  integrating  additional  rice 
genome information and analysis features, and will contribute 
to rice genome analysis and rice information service.
