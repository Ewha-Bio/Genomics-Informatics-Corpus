Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a multi-ligand receptor that is able to bind several different ligands, 
including  advanced  glycation  endproducts,  high-mobility  group  protein  (B)1  (HMGB1),  S-100  calcium-binding  protein, 
amyloid-β-protein,  Mac-1,  and  phosphatidylserine.  Its  interaction  is  engaged  in  critical  cellular  processes,  such  as 
inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and migration, and dysregulation of RAGE and its ligands leads to the 
development of numerous human diseases. In this review, we summarize the signaling pathways regulated by RAGE and its 
ligands identified up to date and demonstrate the effects of hyper-activation of RAGE signals on human diseases, focused 
mainly  on  renal  disorders.  Finally,  we  propose  that  RAGE  and  its  ligands  are  the  potential  targets  for  the  diagnosis, 
monitoring, and treatment of numerous renal diseases.

Introduction

Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a 
transmembrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin 
superfamily  [1].  As  its  name  implicates,  it  can  bind  to 
advanced  glycation  endproducts,  the  resulting  product  of 
non-enzymatic glycosylation [2], and it also has the ability to 
interact with multiple ligands having common motifs as a 
so-called multi-ligand receptor. The ligands include high- 
mobility group protein (B)1 (HMGB1), S-100 calcium- bin-
ding  protein,  amyloid-β-protein,  Mac-1,  and  phosphati-
dylserine  [3].  Interaction  between  RAGE  and  its  ligands 
activates various cellular processes, including inflammation, 
proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and migration [4]. Ex-
pression  of  RAGE  is  different,  depending  on  the  organ, 
developmental stage, and cellular condition [5]. It is highly 
expressed during the embryonic stage, whereas it is mostly 
kept at low levels in adults [5, 6]. Mostly, it is stimulated by 
cellular  stresses,  such  as  inflammation,  and  is  therefore 
easily found to be abnormally over-expressed in many hu-

man chronic diseases [7]. Accumulation of advanced gly-
cation  endproducts  (AGEs)  is  highly  associated  with  the 
pathogenesis  of  diabetes,  which  causes  serious  conse-
quences on metabolic systems [8]. In addition, expression of 
S100 proteins is reported to be involved in many cancers, 
including breast, lung, kidney, and thyroid cancers. Mostly, 
their up-regulation promotes tumorigenesis by stimulating 
metastasis through the activation of relevant transcription 
factors or by acting as chemoattractants [9, 10]. In addition 
to cancers, RAGE and its ligands are abnormally regulated in 
various  types  of  chronic  immune  diseases,  such  as  athe-
rosclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and arthritis [7]. Increasing 
evidence demonstrates the critical role of RAGE signaling in 
many  other  human  diseases  and  suggests  its  stimulating 
factors as potential biomarkers for diagnosis or therapy. In 
this review, we are going to summarize the RAGE signaling 
pathway and its contribution to the pathogenesis of human 
diseases, focused specifically on kidney diseases. Further, we 
propose  the possibility  of using  RAGE and its ligands as 
therapeutic targets.

RAGE and Its Splice Variants

Human  RAGE  is  encoded  by  a  gene  located  on  major 
histocompatibility  complex  (MHC)  class  III  region  on 
chromosome  6  [11].  The  mature  RAGE  has  three  main 
parts,  consisting  of  extracellular,  transmembrane,  and 
cytosolic regions. The extracellular region is composed of 
one V-type and two C-type domains, and the V-type domain 
is responsible for interaction with multiple RAGE ligands. 
The transmembrane domain anchors RAGE to the cellular 
membrane,  and  signals  transduce  into  the  cell  via  the 
cytosolic  domain  [1,  12].  Besides,  RAGE  variants,  repre-
sented  by  three  forms,  called  N-truncated,  dominant- 
negative,  and  soluble  RAGE,  can  be  generated  either  by 
natural alternative splicing or by the action of membrane- 
associated proteases (Fig. 1) [1]. The N-truncated form of 
RAGE  lacks  a  V-domain  so  that  it  can  not  interact  with 
ligands, whereas the cytosolic domain is missing in domi-
nant-negative  RAGE,  which  results  in  no  signal  trans-
duction, though it can bind to ligands. Without the trans-
membrane domain, soluble RAGE is formed and is able to 
circulate  out  of  the  cell  and  act  as  decoys  by  preventing 
ligands  from  binding  to  RAGE  [13].  Therefore,  soluble 
RAGE can neutralize the effect of RAGE ligands, and many 
studies have suggested that this function might be applied to 
inhibition of RAGE signals in human diseases [14].

RAGE Signaling Pathways

RAGE and its ligands are highly expressed in develop-
mental  stages  and  enhance  survival  of  neurons  during 
development  [15].  After  embryonic  development,  these 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

genes are down-regulated and kept a low expression levels 
during  normal  life,  except for  certain  conditions,  such as 
injury and aging [15]. Interestingly, unlike other receptors, 
expression  of  RAGE  is  positively  regulated  by  its  ligand 
stimulation, which means that increasing concentration of 
ligands leads to up-regulation of RAGE. So, RAGE signals 
are accelerated more and more by the accumulation of signal 
stimulants [16].

RAGE is found on the cell surface of various immune cells, 
and most of its ligands are mainly secreted by immune cells, 
including macrophages and dendritic cells; therefore one of 
the major roles of RAGE is involved in inflammation [7, 14]. 
Stimulation of RAGE by its ligands activates the proinflam-
matory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), 
and it then translocates into the nucleus and activates its 
target genes, including several kinds of cytokines respon-
sible for innate or adaptive immunity [17, 18]. Also, NF-κB 
can bind to glyoxalase (Glo1) and suppress its inhibitory 
activity  on  AGE  production  [19].  Target  genes  of  NF-κB 
include anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl proteins; therefore, 
cell  survival  is  also  under  the  control  of  NF-κB  [16].  In 
addition,  the  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase  signaling 
pathway  itself  can  be  activated  by  RAGE  stimulation. 
Specifically, activated RAGE is able to stimulate ERK, p38, 
and JNK, and it leads to induction of cell proliferation [20]. 
Another process involved in RAGE signaling is cell migra-
tion  via  transforming  growth  factor  beta  (TGF-β)  signal 
cascades. TGF-β is activated by RAGE ligand stimulation 
and enhances its downstream signals. They include the Ras 
homolog family and Rho-associated kinase, and activation of 
these genes leads to stable actin filament formation and cell 
migration [21]. Due to RAGE signals being concerned with 

Fig. 1. Structures of receptor for advanced glycation end products and its three main isoforms. Full-length receptor for advanced glycation
endproducts (RAGE) has three different extracellular domains (V, C, C’) and one cytosolic domain. Multi-ligands bind to the V-type domain
and transduce signals through the intracellular domain. The N-truncated isoform lacks the V-type domain, which fails to have receptor-ligand 
interactions.  The  dominant-negative  form  has  no  cytosolic  domain  and  is  not  able  to  transduce  signals  into  the  cell.  Soluble  RAGE  is
formed either by alternative splicing or protease activity and is secreted and prevents ligands from binding to RAGE. V, variable domain;

multiple  cellular  signaling  pathways,  in  particular  with 
immune  responses  and  cell  survival,  the  development  of 
numerous human diseases is associated with it. They include 
diabetes, inflammatory diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular 
diseases, and blockade of RAGE is increasingly proposed as 
a therapeutic target [4].

RAGE Ligands and Kidneys

Expression of RAGE and its ligands is kept at a low level 
in a wide range of cell types, including endothelium, smooth 
muscle cells, mononuclear phagocytes, neurons, and cardiac 
myocytes [22]. However, when RAGE ligands are accumu-
lated by pathological development of relevant diseases, it 
alters the structure of tissues as well as compromise protein 
function in them [23, 24]. Also, increased circulating RAGE 
ligands  induce  the  expression  of  their  receptor,  RAGE; 
therefore, RAGE ligand signals are stimulated as the ligands 
increase [16]. In kidneys, accumulation of RAGE ligands is 
well studied to contribute to both diabetic and non-diabetic 
nephropathy (DN). Firstly, AGEs have been found primarily 
to be up-regulated in renal basement membranes in diabetic 
nephropathies and in some other renal diseases, including 
glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, which are not re-
lated to diabetes [25]. In diabetes, AGEs are highly accumu-
lated  by  increasing  mitochondrial  production  of  reactive 
oxygen species, followed by high intracellular glucose levels 
[26]. Abnormally high concentrations of AGEs impair pro-
ximal tubular cells, which are responsible for regulation of 
AGE  metabolism,  resulting  in  damage  to  those  cells  and 
their function [27, 28]. Also, kidneys play key roles in the 
clearance of AGEs, such that the impaired structure of the 
kidneys by AGEs fails to degrade them [29]. In turn, more 
and more AGEs are accumulated as the kidney is damaged by 
the action of AGEs, and finally, it results in DN [27, 28, 30]. 
Recently, increasing evidence has shown that RAGE ligands 
other than AGEs, including HMGB1 and S-100 proteins, are 
also  up-regulated  in  renal  diseases.  HMGB1  is  a  nuclear 
protein essential for regulating the physical interaction of 
DNA with certain transcription factors, such as p53 [29]; 
however,  when  it  is  released  extracellularly,  it  is  able  to 
mediate  inflammatory  reactions  and  contribute  to  the 
pathogenesis  of  several  diseases,  including  glomerulone-
phritis, lupus nephritis, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) [31, 
32]. In addition, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as 
well as inflammation are also activated in RCC via ERK1/2 
activation [32]. 

Interaction between RAGE and its ligands changes renal 
cellular  processes,  including  inflammation,  proliferation, 
and migration, and they are highly significant processes to 
keep  the  normal  function  of  kidneys;  therefore,  dysregu-

lation of RAGE or its ligand concentrations might give fatal 
effects, leading to the development and pathogenesis of renal 
diseases. 

RAGE and Renal Diseases
Diabetic nephropathy 

DN is one of the diseases triggered by diabetes and finally 
leads to renal failure and elevation of arterial blood pressure 
[33]. Cellular mechanisms involved in the development and 
pathogenesis of DN include glomerular hypertrophy, pro-
duction  of  oxidative  stresses,  fibrosis,  and  inflammation, 
followed  by  hyperglycemia.  As  mediators,  renin,  angio-
tensin, aldosterone, protein kinases, and NADPH are exi-
sting, and hyper-activation of them results in up-regulation 
of  fibrotic  and  inflammatory  factors,  including  TGF-β 
[33-36]. Also, hyperglycemia stimulates glycation and oxi-
dation of macromolecules, which result in the formation of 
AGEs as endproducts [37]. Accumulated AGEs join in the 
up-regulation of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress 
and accelerate the pathogenesis of the disease [38].

Cardio-renal syndrome

Cardio-renal  syndrome  is  a  combined  disorder  having 
both heart and kidney dysfunction. The primary failed organ 
can be either the heart or kidney, and in both cases, the one 
that is diseased earlier impairs the other one, and finally, they 
negatively  affect  each  other  [37].  One  of  the  suggested 
mechanisms  making  these  two  organs  negatively  interact 
with each other is mediated by AGEs [39]. Accumulation of 
AGEs  is  commonly  observed  in  patients  with  both  heart 
failure  and  renal  disorders  [40,  41].  With  heart  failure, 
increase of AGEs leads to inflammation, fibrosis, and de-
layed calcium uptake, which subsequently result in diastolic 
dysfunction.  In  addition,  accumulation  of  AGEs  in  renal 
dysfunction is negatively affected by highly activated inflam-
mation and fibrosis, and further damage of kidney structure 
impairs its own function of AGE clearance [39]. Symptoms 
of the disease might be enhanced by this vicious cycle, as well 
as with other multifactorial signaling pathways involved in 
the pathogenesis.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is one of 
the  most  highly  prevalent  inherited  disorders  and  is 
characterized by the development of thousands of epithelial- 
lined, fluid-filled cysts in the kidney [42]. Cell proliferation, 
inflammation, and fibrosis are the major processes of the 
development and pathogenesis of the disease, and various 
factors, including chemokines and growth factors, are en-
gaged in these signaling pathways [43-45]. Recently, several 

226

www.genominfo.org

studies have reported that expression of HMGB1 and certain 
types of S-100 (S-100A8, 9) is increased around the cystic 
region and proposed them to be disease-stimulating agents 
[46-48]. So, inflammatory and growth factors secreted by 
cyst-lined  epithelial  cells  and  increased  circulating  AGEs 
finally result in compromised renal function at the end stage 
of the disease.

Renal cell carcinomas

RAGE  and  its  ligands  are  reported  to  be  abnormally 
expressed in various cancers, including breast, lung, kidney, 
thyroid, prostate, and oral cancers. S100 protein, one of the 
representative ligands of RAGE, which has at least over 20 
subtypes,  has  been  well  reviewed  to  play  major  roles  in 
tumor-related processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, 
metastasis, and invasion [10]. In renal cancer, S100A1 has 
been observed to be highly expressed in papillary RCC and 
oncocytoma,  which  are  relatively  common  types  of  renal 
cancers,  whereas it  is  absent  in  chromophobe  RCC  [49]. 
Likewise, a broad range of S100 proteins has been detected 
differently, depending on the subtype of renal carcinoma, 
which  means  that  it  should  be  a  useful  biomarker  for 
discriminating the subtype of renal cancers if it is correctly 
examined  [50].  In  addition,  HMGB1,  another  ligand  of 
RAGE, has appeared to be up-regulated and interacts with its 
receptor  for  promoting  cell  proliferation,  migration,  and 
invasion  via  the  ERK  pathway  in  RCC  [32].  From  this 
evidence,  RAGE  and  its  multiple  ligands  are  increasingly 
suggested as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for different 
types of renal carcinomas.

Conclusions and Perspectives

In various types of renal diseases, including both diabetic- 
and  non-diabetic  disorders,  RAGE  and  its  ligands  are 
commonly observed to be dysregulated. The major problem 
of these phenomena in renal diseases might be the vicious 
cycle that impairs kidney by increased AGEs or when other 
RAGE ligands fail to remove them, causing these ligands to 
accumulate and the relevant signals to accelerate. Therefore, 
numerous  studies  suggest  RAGE  and  its  ligands  as  new 
potential targets for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treat-
ment  of  renal  diseases  that  have  abnormal  regulation  of 
them. Firstly, ligands expression or secretion level can be 
used as a diagnostic or staging marker. S100B is already used 
in  evaluations  after  treatment  of  melanoma  in  a  clinical 
setting [51]. Secondly, more trials targeting RAGE ligands 
either with inhibitors of them or the soluble form of RAGE 
have been reported. Soluble RAGE treatment significantly 
alleviates  the  symptoms  of  nephritis  in  vivo  [52],  and  in 
cancer  studies,  nude  mice  injected  with  soluble  RAGE-

over-expressing cells have shown remarkable inhibition of 
tumor  formation  [53].  With  inhibitors  of  AGEs,  several 
agents, including aminoguanidine and pyridoxamine, have 
been tried in humans; some of them have shown enhanced 
renal  function  in  diabetic  patients,  but  these  trials  were 
terminated early because of safety concerns [54, 55]. Finally, 
more  recently,  epigenetic  regulation  by  microRNAs  of 
molecules  involved  in  RAGE  signaling  pathways  is  also 
being studied [56].
