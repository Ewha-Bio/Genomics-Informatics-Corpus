Abstract

The  quality  assurance  (QA)  is  of  utmost  importance  in 
biobanks  when  archived  biomaterials  are  distributed  to 
biomedical  researchers.  For  sample  authentication  and 
cross-contamination  detection,  the  two  fundamental  ele-
ments  of  QA,  STR  genotyping  is  usually  utilized.  Howev-
er,  the  incorporated  number  of  STR  markers  is  highly 
redundant  for  biobanking  purposes,  resulting  in  time  and 
cost  inefficiency.  An  index  to  measure  the  cross-con-
tamination  detection  capability  of  an  STR  marker,  the 
mixture  probability  (MP),  was  developed.  MP  as  well  as 
other  forensic  parameters  for  STR  markers  was  vali-
dated  using  STR  genotyping  data  on  2328  normal 
the  commercial  AmpFlSTR  kit.  For 
Koreans  with 
Koreans,  7  STR  marker 
(D2S1338,  FGA,  D18S51, 
D8S1179,  D13S317,  D21S11,  vWA)  set  was  sufficient  to 
−10  and  cross-con-
provide  discrimination  power  of  ∼10
tamination  detection  probability  of  ∼1.  Interestingly, 
similar  marker  sets  were  obtained  from  African  Ameri-
cans,  Caucasian  Americans,  and  Hispanic  Americans 
under  the  same  level  of  discrimination  power.  Only  a 
small  subset  of  commonly  used  STR  markers  is  suffi-
cient  for  QA  purposes  in  biobanks.  A  procedure  for  se-
lecting  optimal  STR  markers  is  outlined  using  STR  gen-
otyping  results  from  normal  Korean  population.

logical  advancements  in  high-throughput  platforms  have 
triggered  interests  in  high  quality  biomaterials.  In  partic-
ular,  as  the  amount  of  required  biomaterials  for  basic 
researches  on  disease  diagnostics  and  treatment,  target 
identification  and  subsequent  validation  is  increasing  in 
an  unprecedented  pace,  the  need  for  a  stable  supply 
mechanism  of  reliable  biomaterials  is  urgent  and  bio-
banking  has  attracted  a  great  deal  of  attention  as  a  via-
ble  solution.  By  collecting  and  storing  biomaterials  from 
large  numbers  of  individuals  that  can  encompass  a  di-
verse  spectrum  of  socioeconomic,  demographic,  and 
epidemiological  characteristics,  biobanks  are  already 
making  great  impacts  on  various  epidemiological  re-
searches  and  quite  a  few  biobanks  are  already  up  and 
running  world  wide  (Hakonarson  et al.,  2003;  Triendl, 
2003;    LifeGene  Sweden;  Elliott  &  Peakman,  2008;  Bhak 
et al.,  2008;  Ahn,  2007).
    Biobanks  require  high  standards  in  every  aspect  of  its 
usual  operation  for  quality  assurance  (QA)  purposes 
since  poorly  managed  biomaterials  or  related  biomedical 
information  can  do  only  harm.  It  is  usually  required  to 
standardize  all  necessary  steps  as  much  as  possible 
and  document  them  as  standard  operating  protocols 
(SOPs)  in  an  unmistakable  way  (Troyer,  2008).  Many  bi-
obanks  are  currently  in  an  establishment  phase,  aiming 
at  collecting  and  archiving  biomaterials  and  their  rele-
vant  biomedical  information  for  future  use.  Owing  to 
this,  several  working  protocols  of  sample  collection,  de-
livery,  processing,  storage,  and  retrieval  are  available  for 
reference  purposes  (International  Society  for  Biological 
Environmental  Respositories  2008;  Elliott  and  Peakman, 
2008).  However,  the  ultimate  goal  of  a  biobank  is  to 
make  the  general  access  of  research-oriented  people  to 
high  quality  biomaterials  possible  with  minimal  efforts. 
This  requires  an  optimized  procedure  for  sample  dis-
tribution  and  proper  measures  of  QA  for  archived 
biomaterials.  For  instance,  when  genome-wide  associa-
tion  studies  which  usually  require  tens  of  thousands  of 
high  quality  DNA  samples  in  a  short  period  of  time  are 
underway,  providing  them  with  a  proper  level  of  QA  in 
the  required  time  frame  can  be  a  difficult  task.
    QA  of  biomaterials  in  biobanks  raises  two  issues:  to 
authenticate  that  the  specimen  in  a  container  matches 
exactly  the  participant  that  can  be  identified  by  the  label 
on  it  and  to  avoid  cross-contamination  of  biomaterials 
from  different  donors.  Any  of  these  QA  breaches  can 
mislead  or  nullify  the  research  results  in  crucial  ways. 
Although  efforts  to  automate  all  or  parts  of  biobanking 

processes  with  the  help  of  high  precision  machines  are 
going  on  (Downey  and  Peakman,  2008;  McQuillan  and 
Sales,  2008;  Owen,  2008;  Fagan  and  Ball,  2008),  human 
operations  still  comprise  many  integral  portions,  posing 
the  risk  of  unpredictable  quality  problems  during  ordi-
nary  operations.  Subsequently,  there  should  be  a  proper 
safeguard  to  detect  sample  authentication  problems  or 
cross  contamination  events  prior  to  sample  distribution, 
preventing  the  utilization  of  non-quality-compliant  sam-
ples  and,  eventually,  erroneous  or  null-discoveries.
    As  a  biobank  providing  high  quality  DNAs  for  several 
genome-wide  association  studies  on  Koreans,  our  team 
has  collected  DNAs  from  ＞123,000  general  Koreans 
(age  ＞40)  since  year  2001  and  has  been  performing 
short  tandem  repeat  (STR)  genotyping  for  QA  purposes. 
In  particular,  we  have  used  the  commercially  available 
AmpFlSTR  kit  composed  of  15  autosomal  and  one  sex 
chromosomal  STR  markers  prior  to  sample  distribution. 
Based  on  the  core  STR  markers  from  the  combined 
DNA  index  system  (CODIS),  the  STR  panel  works  su-
perb  for  various  jobs  requiring  individual  identification 
such  as  forensics,  mass  victim  identification,  and  pater-
nity  testing  (Jobling  and  Gill,  2004;  Ballantyn,  1997; 
Alford  et al.,  1994).  For  instance,  the  chance  of  two 
random  individuals  having  the  same  STR  typing  profile 
is  ∼10
However,  we  think  this  level  of  performance  is  too  re-
dundant  for  QA  in  biobanks.  As  for  the  Korea  biobank, 
for  instance,  which  is  aiming  at  collecting  biomaterials 
from  ∼300,000  participants,  the  appropriate  level  of 
−7  when  100-fold  re-
discrimination  power  can  be  10
−8  when  1000-fold  re-
dundancy  is  assumed  or  10
dundancy  is  assumed.  Under  this  premise,  it  is  obvious 
that  all  15  autosomal  markers  are  not  required  and,  by 
incorporating  smaller  number  of  highly  polymorphic  STR 
markers  in  an  optimized  way,  cost  and  time  required  for 
QA  can  be  greatly  reduced.  In  this  paper,  we  will  in-
troduce  a  general  strategy  to  select  optimal  STR  mark-
ers  to  be  adopted  in  sample  authentication  and  in  de-
tecting  sample  cross-contamination  prior  to  distribution 
and  illustrate  it  using  our  own  STR  genotyping  results.

DNA  samples  and  PCR

Genomic  DNA  amplification  was  carried  out  using  about 
1.0ng  of  DNA  for  PCR  amplification.  15  STR  loci  were 
co-amplified  with  the  AmpFlSTR1  IdentifierTM  PCR 
Amplification  Kit  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA, 
USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  All 
amplifications  were  done  on  a  GeneAmp  9700PCR  sys-
tem  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA).

Genotyping

Detection  and  genotyping  of  PCR  products  were  carried 
out  on  the  ABI  PRISM  3100  DNA  Analyzer  (Applied 
Biosystems  Division/Perkin-Elmer,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA) 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  Electro-
phoresis  results  were  analyzed  by  Genemapper  v3.1 
software.

Statistical  analysis

Allele  and  genotype  frequencies  were  calculated  using 
the  gene  counting  algorithm.  Forensic  parameters  such 
as  matching  probability  (MP)  (Brenner  and  Morris,  1990), 
power  of  exclusion  (PE)  (Brenner  and  Morris,  1990), 
power  of  discrimination  (PD)  (Jones,  1972),  probability  of 
identity  (PI)  (Waits et al.,  2001),  polymorphic  information 
content  (PIC)  (Botstein  et al.,  1980),  observed  hetero-
zygosity  (H),  expected  heterozygosity  (HET)  (Nei,  1987), 
and  the  deviation  from  the  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium 
(HWE)  (Guo  and  Thompson,  1992)  were  calculated.  The 
HWE  was  further  validated  using  the  Arlequin  package 
(Excoffier  et al.,  2005).

cross-contamination  of  biomaterials  from  two  donors  is 
calculated  as  follows.  When  a  sample  is  mixed  with  bio-
materials 
in  approximately  equal 
amounts,  ＞2  peaks  will  appear  in  the  genotyping  result 
only  when  the  genotypes  from  two  donors  are  not 
identical.  Let  represent  the  probability  that  one  donor’s 
genotype  is  given  by  for  a  specific  marker.  Since  we  are 
dealing  with  genotypes  whose  parental  origins  are  un-
certain,  we  assume  without  loss  of  generality.  Then,  the 
mixture  probability  (MP)  which  is  the  probability  that  a 
marker  can  detect  cross-contamination  from  two  differ-
ent  donors  is  given  by

    We  also  performed  simulations  to  validate  the  MPs 
given  by  Eq.  (1)  or  (2)  using  our  own  genotype  results. 
From  each  marker’s  pool  of  genotypes,  we  randomly 
selected  two  genotypes.  If  the  two  genotypes  are  not 
identical,  observed  mixture  count  is  increased  by  one. 
Otherwise,  it  is  untouched.  After  performing  the  random 
selection  process  over  times,  the  simulated  MP  is  calcu-
lated  by

    Actual  simulations  were  carried  out  in  a  batch  mode: 
we  calculated  the  MS  with  and  repeated  this  procedure 

over  20  times.  Then,  the  average  and  standard  deviation 
of  20  MSs  are  reported  for  each  marker.

aSTR  markers  were  shown  in  order  according  to  their  capabilities  for  differentiation  and  mixture  detection  for  Korean  pop-
ulation;  bpower  of  discrimination  (PD);  cprobability  of  identity  (PI);  dmixture  probabilities  of  ME,  MH  and  MS.  See  also  formula

−17,  and  0.999996,  respectively.  Since  markers  are 

×10
independent,  the  collective  discrimination  powers  were 
calculated  by  the  product  rule.  The  collective  discrim-
ination  power  indexes  illustrate  the  highly  polymorphic 
nature  of  STR  markers  in  the  AmpFlSTR  panel;  these 
markers  provide  sufficient  differential  power  for  forensic 
or  paternity  test  purposes.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that 
HWE  was  violated  in  9  markers  of  our  population 
(D8S1179,  D7S820,  CSF1PO,  TH01,  D16S539,  D2S1338, 
D19S433,  D18S51,  FGA).  This  is  not  due  to  any  compu-
tational  artifacts  of  our  methodology  adopted  in  this 
study  because  similar  results  were  also  obtained  from 
an 
(Nei, 
1987).  The  exact  reason  for  this  exotic  behavior,  how-
ever,  is  not  fully  understood  yet.
    As  stated  in  Introduction,  the  level  of  collective  dis-
criminative  power  of  the  commercial  kit  is  too  redundant 
for  QA  purposes  of  usual  biobanks  where  biomaterials 
from  ∼105  participants  are  to  be  archived  for  the  most 
ambitious  cases.  The  optimal  set  of  STR  markers  for  QA 
can,  then,  be  obtained  by  recruiting  markers  of  the  best 
discrimination  power  recursively.  The  number  of  optimal 
markers  will  be  determined  by  the  number  of  markers 
whose  collective  discrimination  power  satisfies 
the 
pre-specified  target  value.  In  Table  2,  we  listed  the  cu-
mulative  PD,  PI,  ME,  MH,  MS  values  along  STR  markers 
ranked  according  to  their  discrimination  power.  The  STR 
markers  ranked  according  to  their  discrimination  power 
for  Korean  population  were  as  follows:  D2S1338,  FGA, 
D18S51,  D8S1179,  D13S317,  D21S11,  vWA,  D19S433, 
D16S539,  D5S818,  D7S820,  CSF1PO,  D3S1358,  TH01, 
TPOX.  The  discrimination  power  is  determined  in  princi-
ple  by  the  interplay  between  the  number  of  admissible 
alleles  of  a  marker  and  the  homogeneity  in  allele  fre-
quency  distributions  among  admissible  alleles.  Obviou-
sly,  a  marker  is  not  suitable  for  sample  authentication  or 
cross-contamination  detection  if  it  has  only  a  few  ad-
missible  alleles  or  all  of  its  allele  frequencies  are  con-
densed  in  a  small  number  of  alleles.  For  instance, 
D2S1338  which  possessed  the  best  discrimination  pow-
er  for  Koreans  required  6  alleles  of  the  largest  frequency 
to  cover  80%  of  total  number  of  alleles.  To  the  contrary, 
TPOX  which  possessed  the  worst  discrimination  power 
for  Koreans  required  only  2  alleles  of  the  largest  fre-
quency  to  reach  that  level.
    For  the  purpose  of  sample  authentication  or  cross- 
contamination  detection,  top  5∼7  STR  markers  are 
enough  for  the  Korea  biobank  according  to  our  results 
in  Table  2,  since  the  collective  individual  discrimination 
−10  with  this  number  of  STR 
power  can  be  10
markers.  This  level  of  discrimination  power  is  100∼
1,000  times  redundant  for  the  target  number  of  samples 
to  be  recruited  for  the  Korea  biobank.  For  comparison,

Discussion

Sample  authentication  and  cross-contamination  de-
tection  are  of  utmost  importance  for  QA  of  biomaterials 
archived  in  biobanks.  Owing  partly  to  the  highly  poly-
morphic  nature  of  STR  markers  and  partly  to  the  avail-
ability  of  various  commercial  kits  making  the  whole 
process  of  genotyping  handy,  STR  analysis  lends  itself 
as  the  de  facto  standard  approach  for  QA.  However,  the 
STR  markers  in  most  commercial  kits  are  highly  re-
dundant  for  this  purpose,  with  excessive  combined  dis-
crimination  power.  When  a  biobank  is  designed,  its 
sample  collection  target  volume  is  first  set  and,  sub-
sequently,  the  optimal  level  of  collective  discrimination 
power  can  be  specified.  For  instance,  when  the  sample 
collection  target  number  is  set  ∼105  level,  the  optimal 
−8,  allow-
level  of  discrimination  power  can  be  10
ing  for  a  level  of  redundancy  100∼1,000  fold.  In  this 
paper,  we  detailed  a  strategy  to  select  an  optimal  STR 
marker  set  to  allow  the  predetermined  target  authentica-
tion  power  with  sufficient  level  of  cross-contamination 
detection  power  at  the  same  time.  Although  our  study 
was  based  on  genotyping  results  from  a  commercial  kit, 
the  strategy  described  in  our  study  is  valid  in  general. 
After  setting  target  levels  of  collective  sample  authenti-
cation  and  cross-contamination  detection  power,  they

can  choose  an  optimal  set  of  STR  markers  simply  by 
looking  at 
forensic  parameters  and  mixture 
probabilities.  Of  course  after  an  optimal  set  of  STR 
markers  is  selected,  biobanks  should  optimize  a  geno-
typing  protocol  so  that  high-throughput  QA  can  be  ach-
ieved  on  a  regular  basis.  Utilizing  STR  markers  from 
commercial  kits  can  be  advantageous  because  they  are 
already  validated  for  batch  operations  and  many  basic 
statistical  characteristics  of  them  are  possibly  known  for 
the  population  of  interest  (Butler,  2006).
    The  sample  collection  in  biobanks  is  usually  carried 
out  by  distributed  facilities,  in  which  case  the  quality 
control  and  maintenance  of  data  integrity  can  be  a 
complicated  issue  (Troyer,  2008).  When  the  collection  of 
large  number  of  blood  samples  needs  to  be  completed 
in  a  timely  manner,  for  instance,  the  risk  of  confusing 
participants’  identifiers  and  labels  on  containers  or  epi-
demiological  questionnaires  increases.  This  risk  will  be 
greatly  amplified  when  some  samples  are  obtained  from 
new  participants  and  generating  new  identifiers  will  be 
enough  for  them  while  others  are  obtained  from  return-
ing  participants  for  follow-ups  where  existing  identifiers 
endowed  to  participants  should  be  matched  exactly. 
Furthermore,  when  a  large  number  of  samples  are  proc-
essed  and  important  biomaterials  like  DNAs  are  fractio-
nated  to  multiple  small  volume  tubes  for  long  term  stor-
age,  the  risk  of  cross-contamination  will  also  increase. 
In  fact,  there  were  several  cases  of  quality  breach  in  the 
Korea  Biobank  identified  through  STR  genotypings. 
Some  of  the  cases  were  traced  back  to  label  mix-ups 
during  blood  subsampling  while  other  cases  were  traced 
back  to  cross  contaminations  during  biomaterial  fractio-
nations.  Although  the  strict  adherence  to  established 
SOPs  and  the  utilization  of  sophisticated  machineries 
and  information  infrastructure  can  reduce  these  risks 
substantially,  any  human  operations  by  themselves  pose 
possible  risk  of  errors.  As  the  final  safeguard  against 
such  unpredictable  risks,  sample  authentication  and 
cross-contamination  detection  procedures  prior  to  sam-
ple  distribution  will  be  crucial  in  practice.
    In  the  present  study,  various  factors  that  could  com-
plicate  the  cross-contamination  detection  problem  were 
omitted.  For  instance,  we  assumed  that  only  two  donors 
contributed  their  biomaterials  in  approximately  equal 
amounts.  Apparently,  this  simplified  the  whole  problem 
because,  in  general,  contributions  are  from  ＞2  donors 
with  unequal  amounts.  Since  total  amount  of  bio-
materials  is  small,  any  transfer  of  foreign  biomaterials 
during  the  procedure  can  hardly  be  undetected.  Utilizing 
commercial  kits  can  be  advantageous  in  this  case  also 
because  vendors  provide  ways  to  estimate  contributions 
from  different  donors  by  comparing  allelic  peak  ampli-
tudes.  Supplementing  this  information  may  make  the 

whole  discussion  more  thorough.
    When  we  compared  the  optimal  STR  marker  sets 
from  4  ethnic  populations  (Koreans,  African  American, 
Caucasian  American,  and  Hispanic  Americans)  under  the 
same  level  of  discrimination  power  (10∼10),  they  were 
almost 
identical.  17  In  all  ethnic  populations,  the 
D2S1338  marker  provided  the  most  optimal  perform-
ance  and  FGA  and  D18S51  markers  provided  the  next 
optimal  performances.  Beyond  these  markers,  the  exact 
ranks  of  STR  markers  were  slightly  different.  We  are  not 
so  sure  whether  the  same  universal  set  of  STR  markers 
can  be  utilized  in  general  biobanks  regardless  of  their 
ethnic  background  although  our  results  seem  to  support 
the  idea.  This  obviously  requires  testing  our  strategy  in 
a  lot  more  ethnic  populations  than  we  did  in  this  study.
