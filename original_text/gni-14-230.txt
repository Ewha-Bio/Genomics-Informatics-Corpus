Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association between the loci and it could give us a preliminary insight into the 
genetic history of the population. In the present study LD patterns and effective population size (Ne) of three Korean cattle 
breeds along with Chinese, Japanese and Mongolian cattle were compared using the bovine Illumina SNP50 panel. The 
effective  population  size  (Ne)  is  the  number  of  breeding  individuals  in  a  population  and  is  particularly  important  as  it 
determines the rate at which genetic variation is lost. The genotype data in our study comprised a total of 129 samples, 

varying from 4 to 39 samples. After quality control there were ∼29,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which 
r2 value was calculated. Average distance between SNP pairs was 1.14 Mb across all breeds. Average r2 between adjacent SNP 
pairs ranged between was 0.1 for Yanbian to 0.3 for Qinchuan. Effective population size of the breeds based on r2 varied from 
16 in Hainan to 226 in Yanbian. Amongst the Korean native breeds effective population size of Brindle Hanwoo was the least 
with Ne = 59 and Brown Hanwoo was the highest with Ne = 83. The effective population size of the Korean cattle breeds has 
been decreasing alarmingly over the past generations. We suggest appropriate measures to be taken to prevent these local 
breeds in their native tracts.

Introduction

The  availability  of  genome  wide  single  nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) chips has made it possible to study the 
linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, effective population 
size  (Ne),  genome  wide  associations,  etc.  easily  and 
effectively. Whole genome SNP panels are widely being used 
to study the genetic diversity in different livestock breeds 
[1-3]. LD and Ne form an important part in understanding 
the genetic diversity of any breed. Present day breeds are a 
result  of  adaptation  and  extensive  selection  for  favorable 
traits. So, studying effective population size of breeds over 
several  generations  helps  in  understanding  the  genetic 
history and selection pressures that the population might 
have undergone in the history. Effective population size is 
particularly  important  in  population  and  quantitative 
genetics and in evolutionary and conservation biology as it 
determines the rate at which genetic variation is lost [4].

Korean cattle are taurine type cattle available across the 
mainland and nearby islands. There are three main cattle 
breeds in Korea viz., Brown Hanwoo (BH), Brindle Hanwoo 
(BNH), and Jeju Black (JB). BH is the main cattle breed of 
Korea and has an established breeding and selection pro-
gram. The number of BH runs in millions whereas the other 
two breeds have few thousand animals only. A close relative 
of BH called Yanbian (YB) also exists close to the Korea and 
China border [5]. So, we included the YB breed in the study 
as  it  is  the  unselected  breed  and  would  provide  a  direct 
comparison  between  the  selected  Korean  breeds  and 
unselected breeds. Korean cattle are known to have migrated 
from North China and Mongolia and from Korea to Japan. 
Considering this fact we conducted this study to understand 
the  LD  patterns  and  the  effective  population  size  of  the 
Korean breeds along with Chinese, Mongolian (MG), and 
Japanese  breeds.  It  is  already  known  that  due  to  various 
reasons about 16% of the cattle breeds are already extinct 
and 30% face the risk of extinction. Understanding the LD

Plink ver. 1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/∼purcell/ 
plink/)  [7]  was  used  for  the  quality  control  of  the  raw 
genotype  data.  Quality  control  was  performed  for  minor 
allele frequency, missingness, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium 
(HWE),  and  genotyping  quality.  Beagle  program  [8]  was 
used for imputation of the missing genotypes. Five thousand 
sixty-seven markers were excluded based on HWE test (p ≤ 
0.0001)  and  further  1,825  SNPs  were  excluded  based  on 
frequency test (minor allele frequency ＜ 0.01). Final dataset 
consisted of a total of 28,708 SNPs. A total of 129 samples 
were analyzed in the study. SNeP program [9] was used to 
calculate pairwise LD and Ne. LD based Ne was calculated 
according to Sved [10] as below,

Blood  samples  were  collected  from  BH,  BNH,  and  JB. 
Twenty (n = 20) animals were sampled from each Korean 
breed.  Genotype  data  of  Korean  cattle  was  merged  with 
genotype data from six other Asian breeds that included YB, 
Luxi (LX), Hainan (HN), Qinchuan (QC), Wagyu (WAG), 
and  MG  cattle.  The  data  for  these  six  Asian  breeds  was 
downloaded from dryad.org [6]. There were a total of 129 
samples from the 9 Asian breeds in the study (Table 1). 

Genomic DNA for genotyping assays was extracted from 
the blood sample using DNeasy 96 Blood and Tissue Kit 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA quantification was per-
formed using a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific 
Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). DNA samples were submitted 
for genotyping with total DNA of 900 ng, 260/280 ratio ＞1.8, 
and DNA concentration of 20 ng/μL. The genotyping for 
animals was done by the Animal Genome & Bioinformatics 
Division of the National Institute of Animal Science, Rural 
Development Administration (RDA), Korea, using a Bovine-
SNP50 BeadChip ver. 1 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).

where r2 is the LD, c is the recombination rate and Ne is the 
effective population size.

Population structure was studied using Fst and principal 
component  analysis  (PCA)  as  implemented  in  adegent  R 
package [11]. Genetic distances among the pair of popu-
lations were calculated using “WC84” method implemented 
in Hierfstat [12]. 

Results and Discussion

In the present study, we observed a clear separation of 
Korean  cattle  breeds  from  other  breeds.  Based  on  WC84 
genetic distances, Korean breeds were found to be closer to 
YB and WAG cattle breeds (Supplementary Fig. 1). Among 
all the breeds in the study, heterozygosity (Hs) was highest 
in YB (0.44) and lowest in HN (0.16). Amongst the Korean 
cattle BH (0.40) had the highest heterozygosity compared to 
JB (0.39) and BNH (0.38). The difference in heterozygosity 
amongst the Korean breeds was very small which suggests 
the genetic closeness of these populations. The heterozygosity 
in our study was higher than that reported by Strucken et al. 
[13] which could be because of different SNPs used in the 
final dataset.

Population  differentiation  and  structure  were  studied 
using Fst and PCA. Highest Fst values were seen for HN 
which is azebu cattle from China. The lowest Fst value was 
observed for YB followed by the Korean breeds BH, BNH, 
and JB (Supplementary Fig. 2). Low Fst values in Korean 
populations suggest lack of population differentiation. This 
also suggests that these breeds could be interbreeding freely 
in the past. In PCA, WAG formed a separate cluster while 
Korean  cattle  still  formed  a  close  cluster  along  with  YB 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Both Fst based analysis and PCA 
showed  that  Korean  breeds  have  yet  not  differentiated 
enough from one another.

A  Sharma, et al.  LD  and  Ne  in  Korean  Cattle

LD patterns in the 9 Asian cattle breeds were compared as 
it could help us understand the forces that structured the 
present day populations and will also reflect the past evolu-
tionary and demographic events. LD across the genome gives 
an insight into the population history, the breeding system 
and the pattern of geographic subdivision [14]. In our study, 
the average distance between SNP pairs was 1.14 Mb across 
all  breeds.  The  LD  decreased  with  increasing  physical 
distance  between  the  markers  (Fig.  1).  Estimates  of  LD 
based on average r2 values varied from 0.1 for YB to 0.31 for 
QC (Table 1). Lowest level of LD in YB could be because it 
didn’t undergo any artificial selection. Other cattle breeds in 
the study undergo moderate to intensive selection regimes. 
Among the Korean breeds, BH (0.1) had the lowest value of 
LD while BNH had the highest LD value of 0.13. BH is the 
only Korean breed that has a dedicated breeding and selection 
program which could be the reason for low LD in this breed. 
Twenty  BH  Korea  proven  bulls  (called  KPN)  are  used 
throughout the country for artificial insemination of cows, 
thus leading to low LD. Similar pattern was observed by 
Edea et al. [15] in Korean cattle. Average LD in Japanese 
cattle, WAG, for all SNP pairs was found to be 0.31 which 
was less than the Chinese (with an exception of YB) and MG 
cattle but more than the Korean cattle breeds. WAG, which 
is a premium beef breed of Japan, has been maintained as a 
closed breed since ∼100 years which could be one of the 
reasons for higher LD. LX, HN, QC and also MG breeds had 
higher LD than the other breeds which indicate their long 

history  of  domestication.  The  improvement  of  MG  cattle 
began  in  1949  by  crossbreeding  with  shorthorn  cattle 
(http://www.thecattlesite.com/breeds/beef/28/mongolian/). 
In contrast to Chinese and MG cattle, a dedicated breeding 
program for Korean cattle was started only in 1979 [16]. 

Effective  population  size  is  strongly  associated  with 
genetic variability and adaptation. So to better understand 
the size and structure of these cattle populations, effective 
population size was calculated using the LD estimates (r2). 
All the cattle populations showed a declining trend in their 
effective population size (Fig. 2). Amongst all the breeds 
under study YB had the highest Ne = 226 until 13 genera-
tions ago while Chinese HN and QC had the lowest Ne of 16. 
According  to a  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  of  the 
United Nations (FAO) report (ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/ 
012/v6950t/v6950t02.pdf), HN cattle of china which is of 
indicine origin is categorized as an endangered breed and the 
total number of animals in the Hainan island has dropped 
considerably  owing  to  economic  reasons  and  lack  of  an 
organized effort. HN and QC were followed by MG, LX, and 
WAG in which Ne was 20, 23 and 37, respectively. Among 
the Korean cattle BNH had the smallest Ne = 59 until 13 
generations  ago  and  JB  and  BH  had  a  Ne  of  67  and  83 
respectively.  This  is  however  considerably  less  than  that 
reported by Lee et al. [17] and Li and Kim [18]. Lee et al. [17] 
reported  Ne  in  BH  to  be  352  until  10  generations  ago 
whereas Li and Kim [18] reported Ne to be 630 around 11 
generations ago. Dang et al. [19] estimated Ne to be 47, 5 
years ago from 2011. The trend of LD and Ne is the same as 
reported by Li and Kim [18] and Lee et al. [17] however the 
difference  in  estimated  number  could  be  attributed  to

number of samples used in the study and SNP quality control 
measures. The results might also differ because of the model 
used to study LD and Ne. In our study sample size was the 
limiting factor. Increase in sample size will further validate 
the results of the study. 

The pattern of LD and Ne is considerably affected by the 
past  historic  events  of  the  population.  In  this  study  we 
observed a sharp decline in the effective population size of all 
the cattle breeds. We observed a consistent decline in the 
size  of  cattle  populations  throughout  all  the  generations 
however  a  sharp  plunge  in  effective  population  size  was 
observed at ∼50–100 generations ago. This was the time of 
formation of the current breeds. Further decline in Ne was 
observed at ∼50 generations ago in Korean cattle. This was 
the  time  when  selection  and  development  of  breeding 
programs  had  just  begun.  The  modern  day  cattle  genetic 
structure, LD and Ne is a result of the various historic events 
and extensive artificial and natural selection. 

In  our  study  we  found  a  steep  decline  in  the  effective 
population size of cattle populations. Effective population size 
has been decreasing at an alarmingly high rate in Korean cattle 
population especially BNH and JB. We suggest strict actions 
and strategies to be adopted to increase the effective population 
size while maintaining the genetic diversity of the breeds.
