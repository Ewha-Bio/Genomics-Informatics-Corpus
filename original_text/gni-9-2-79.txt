Abstract

Two  initial  models  of  cold-adapted  lipase  PsLip1  have 
been  constructed,  based  on  homology  with  the  bacterial 
lipases Chromobacterium viscosum  (CvLip)  and Pseudo-
monas cepacia  (PcLip),  whose  X-ray  structures  have 
been  solved  and  refined  to  high  resolution.  The  mature 
polypeptide  chains  of  these  lipases  have  84%  similarity. 
The  models  of  Mod1  and  Mod2  have  been  compared 
with  the  tertiary  structures  of  CvLip  and  PcLip,  respec-
tively,  and  analyzed  in  terms  of  stabilizing  interactions. 
Several  structural  aspects  that  are  believed  to  contribute 
to  protein  stability  have  been  compared:  the  number  of 
conserved  salt  bridges,  aromatic  interactions,  hydrogen 
bonds,  helix  capping,  and  disulfide  bridges.  The  3-di-
mensional  structural  model  of  PsLip1  has  been  con-
structed  in  order  to  elucidate  the  structural  reasons  for 
the  decreased  thermostability  of  the  enzyme  in  compar-
ison  with  its  mesophilic  counterparts.

Keywords:  cold-adapted  lipase,  thermostability,  homol-

Introduction

Microorganisms  living  in  extreme  environments  have 
adapted  to  their  habitants  in  such  a  way  that  metabolic 
processes  permit  them  to  survive  and  function.  Among 
these  adaptations  are:  specific  mechanisms  for  energy 
transduction  and  for  the  regulation  of  the  intracellular 
environment  and  metabolism,  stability  of  structural  and 
functional  components  of  the  cell  membrane  and  cell 
wall,  reaction  kinetics,  protein  conformation,  and  func-
tion  of  enzymes  (Atlas  and  Bartha,  1987;  Prins  et al., 
1990;  Suzuki et al.,  2003;  Tutino et al.,  2009).  One  limit-
ing  factor  for  survival  is  temperature.  All  microorganisms 
have  a  characteristic  optimal  growth  temperature  at 
which  they  exhibit  their  highest  growth  and  reproductive

rate  and  a  range  of  temperatures  that  they  can  tolerate. 
    Psychrotrophic  microorganisms  constitute  a  major 
class  in  the  microbial  world,  which  has  vast  regions  of 
permanently  cold  environments:  deep-sea  water  and  po-
lar  and  alpine  regions.  In  spite  of  the  diversity  and 
abundance  of  these  extremophiles,  the  numerous  phys-
iological  and  biochemical  adaptations  to  life  at  temper-
atures  close  to  0oC  remain  poorly  documented  (Joseph, 
2008;  Morita,  1975;  Russel,  1992).
    The  analysis  of  the  structure-stability  relationship  of 
proteins  from  extremophiles  and  the  comparison  with 
their  mesophilic  counterparts  have  provided  insights  into 
the  factors  governing  thermal  stability.  Several  struc-
tures  of  mesophilic  enzymes  have  been  solved  and 
compared  with  their  mesophilic  counterparts  (Fujinaga et 
al.,  1993;  Hennig  et al.,  1995;  Korndorfer  et al.,  1995; 
Russel et al.,  1994;  Yip et al.,  1995).  So  far,  at  the  other 
end  of  the  spectrum,  enzymes  from  psychrophilic  organ-
isms,  has  been  largely  neglected.  This  is  due  mainly  to 
the  instability  of  psychrophilic  enzymes  and,  in  some 
cases,  the  lack  of  isogony  to  their  mesophilic  counter-
parts.  Sequence  comparison  and  structure  prediction 
have  been  performed  on  the  cold-adapted  lipase  PsLip1 
from  the  psychrotrophic  bacteria  Alaskan Pseudomonas 
sp.  B11-1.  A  3-dimensional  structural  model  for  PsLip1, 
based  on  the  structures  of  lipases,  has  thus  far  clarified. 
the  structural  reasons  for  the  decreased  thermostability 
of  the  enzyme  in  comparison  with  its  mesophilic  coun-
terparts.

Methods

DNA  sequencing

All  methods  concerning  DNA  manipulation  were  per-
formed  as  described  by  Sambrook et al.  (1989).  All  bas-
es  were  sequenced  at  least  once  in  each  direction  using 
the  chain  termination  method  with  Dye  Primer  Termina-
tor  sequencing  kits,  using  an  Applied  Biosystem  370A 
DNA  sequencer.  Sequence  analysis  was  carried  out  with 
the  software  program  DNASTAR  (DNASTAR,  Inc.,  USA).

Molecular  Modeling

Multiple  sequence  alignment  was  carried  out  by  using 
the  MEGALIGN  program  of  the  DNASTAR  package  by 
Clustal  method.  The  PHD  secondary  structure  prediction 
and  prediction-based  threading  methods  (Rost,  B.  and

Sander,  C.,  1993)  were  used  through  electronic  mail  at 
http://www.emblheidelberg.de/predictprotein/ppDoPred.html. 
Atomic  coordinates  were  obtained  from  the  Brookhaven 
Protein  DATA  Base  for  CvLip  (code  CVL)  and  PcLip 
(code  2LIP).  Two  initial  models  were  constructed  by  ho-
mology  modeling  from  CVL  coordinates  as  a  reference 
structure  (Mod1)  and  from  the  2LIP  coordinates  as  a 
reference  structure  (Mod2)  by  the  Automated  Knowledge- 
based  Protein  Modeling  Server  (Swiss-Model)  at  the 
GLAXO 
in  Geneva, 
Switzerland  (GIMB)  (Peitsch et al.,  1996)  via  the  internet 
(http://expasy.Hcuge.ch/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html). 
The  quality  of  these  structures  has  been  examined  by 
the  PROCHECK  (Laskowski  et al.,  1993)  and  WHAT  IF 
(Vriend,  G.,  1990)  programs  of  the  Biotech  Validations 
Suite  for  Protein  Structures  (EMBL  Heidelberg,  Germany) 
via  the  internet  (http://biotech.embl-heidelberg.de:8400/). 
The  initial  models  were  refined  by  energy  minimization 
using  the  steepest  descent  method,  followed  by  the 
conjugate  gradient  method.  The  minimization  calcu-
lations  were  conducted  using  the  CHARM  module  of  the 
QUANTA  software  package  (QUANTA  4.0;  Molecular 
Simulations,  Burlington,  MA).  The  final  models  were  first 
evaluated  using  the  Protein  Health  module  of  QUANTA 
and  then  by  3D  profile  method  (Bowie et al.,  1991),  as 
described  by  Luthy et al.  (1992).  The  calculations  were 
performed  on  Silicon  Graphics  Indigo2  or  Unix  systems.

Results  and  Discussion
PsLip1  showed  maximal  activity  at  35oC  toward  p-nitro-
phenyl  laurate.  The  enzyme  was  found  to  be  stable  at 
30oC:  less  than  10%  of  the  original  activity  was  lost  in 
60  min.  However,  nearly  90%  of  the  activity  was  lost  at 
60oC  in  60  min  and  completely  lost  at  70oC  in  60  min. 
The  activation  energy  for  the  hydrolysis  of  p-nitrophenyl 
laurate  was  determined  to  be  12  kcal/mol  in  the  range 
of  5oC  to  35oC.  The  activation  energies  for  enzymes 
from  other  sources  have  been  reported  with  the  same 
substrate:  Antarctic  bacteria,  12-17  kcal/mol;  mesophilic 
Pseudomonas. aeruginosa, 25 kcal/mol (Feller et al., 1990).
    Two  initial  models  of  PsLip1  have  been  constructed, 
based  on  its  homology  with  two  bacterial  lipases, 
Chromobacterium visccosum  (CvLip)  and Pseudomonas 
cepacia  (PcLip),  whose  X-ray  structures  have  been 
solved  and  refined  to  high  resolution.  The  mature  poly-
peptide  chains  of  these  lipases  have  84%  similarity.  The 
PsLip1  protein  sequence  was  aligned  to  both  the  PcLip 
and  CvLip  sequences  with  the  bl2seq  program  on  NCBI. 
The  PsLip1  sequence  shows  a  sequence  identity  of 
47%  and  32%  to  lipases  from  PcLip  and  CvLip, 
respectively.  However,  there  are  large  and  significant 
differences  in  the  tertiary  structures  of  the  enzymes  due 
to  different  conformations,  based  on  the  differences  in

quences  of  PsLip1  compared  with  other  lipases.  The  secondary  structure  elements  are  given  for  the Chromobacterium visco-

crystallization  conditions.  In  the  CvLip  structure,  the  cat-
alytic  triad  is  not  exposed  to  the  solvent,  whereas  in 
PcLip,  the  active  site  is  highly  open  to  the  solvent 
through  the  opening  at  the  helical  lid  (Kim et al.,  1997; 
Lang  et al.,  1996).
    The 
(Mod1-closed  con-
formation)  was  constructed  based  on  reference  structure 
of  CvLip  by  using  Optimist  mode  of  Swiss-Model,  which 
allows  customization  of  the  performed  modeling  by  user 
defined  sequences  and  reference  structure.  Initially,  five 
homologous  lipase  sequences  were  aligned  by  Clustal 
method  (Fig.  1).  Then,  two  lipases  (PsF  and  PsA)  were 
deleted,  and  the  necessary  corrections  have  been  in-
troduced  manually,  based  on  PHD  secondary  structure 
prediction  and  prediction-based  threading  (Rost  et al., 
1993)  (Fig.  2).
    Several  possible  sequence  alignments  have  been  used 
as  input  files  for  Swiss-Model.  The  model  with  the  best 
stereochemical  properties  was  used  further  for  refine-
ment  by  energy  minimization.  The  same  procedure  has 
been  used  for  construction  of  the  second  model  of 

PsLip1  (Mod2  open  conformation)  but  was  based  on  the 
reference  structure  of  PcLip. 
    The  calculation  of  close  contacts  revealed  no  large 
aromatic  overlaps  left  in  the  final  models  of  PsLip1.  The 
last  evaluation  of  the  quality  of  the  models  was  per-
formed  by  3D  profile  analysis.  The  profile  window  plots 
of  reference  structures  and  final  models  agreed  well. 
The  Luthy/Einsenberg  score  for  Mod1  was  79.0  (84.7  for 
the  X-ray  structure  of  CvLip)  and  69.5  for  Mod2  (85.8 
for  the  X-ray  structure  of  PcLip).  However  the  reliability 
of  the  models  was  low  in  the  refined  structure  before  in-
sertion  (L143-S145)  and  long  deletion  (I200-P209). 

Analysis  of  the  models  and  relation  with  thermo-
stability

The  Mod1  and  Mod2  models  have  been  compared  with 
the  tertiary  structures  of  CvLip  and  PcLip,  respectively, 
and  analyzed  in  terms  of  stability  of  the  contribution  to 
protein-stabilizing  interactions.  Several  structural  aspects 
that  are  believed  to  contribute  to  protein  stability  have

Pseudomonas cepacia lipase,  and  Chromobacterium viscosum  lipase,  respectively.

been  compared:  the  number  of  conserved  salt  bridges, 
aromatic  interactions,  hydrogen  bonds,  helix  capping, 
and  disulfide  bridges  (Table  1).
(1)  Salt  bridges
The  electrostatic  interactions  between  side  chains  of 
charged  residues  are  believed  to  contribute  essentially 
to  protein  stability.  A  salt  bridge  is  defined  as  an  ion 

pair  with  a  distance  of  2.5-4.0  Å  between  charged 

non-hydrogen  atoms.  Comparisons  between  3-dimen-
sional  structures  of  thermophilic,  mesophilic,  and  psy-
chrophilic  enzymes  (homology-based  models)  indicate  a 
clear  correlation  between  increasing  numbers  of  poten-
tial  salt  bridges  and  enzyme  themostability.  In  the  case 
of  PsLip1,  the  amount  of  potential  salt  bridges  is  similar 
to  that  of  mesophilic  enzymes  and  even  slightly  higher.
(2)  Aromatic-aromatic  interactions
These  interactions  were  defined  as  pairs  of  aromatic 
residues  with  distances  between  the  phenyl  ring  cent-

roids  of  less  than  7 Å.  In  the  case  of  PsLip1,  both  mod-

els  have  the  same  amount  of  such  interactions  as  the 
open  structure  of  PcLip,  in  which  a  large  hydrophobic 
area  and  active  center  are  exposed  to  the  solvent.  Four 
residues  of  the  aromatic  cluster  in  the  core  of  the  struc-
ture  of  CvLip  (F122-F119-F142-F146)  are  disrupted  in 
PcLip1  and  absent  in  both  models  of  PsLip1.  The  de-
creased  amount  of  aromatic-aromatic  interactions  in  the 
core  of  Mod1  of  PsLip1  in  comparison  with  the  corre-
sponding  structure  of  CvLip  could  mostly  contribute  to 
the  decreased  thermostability  of  the  psychrotrophic 
protein. 
(3)  Hydrogen  bonds
The  hydrogen  bonds  shown  in  Table  1  were  calculated 

using  a  distance  cut-off  of  3.3 Å  and  an  angle  cut-off 
of  90o,  with  the  linear  hydrogen  bond  0.  The  distance 

cut-off  was  applied  to  the  distance  between  the  hydro-
gen  donor  and  acceptor  atoms.  The  angle  formed  by 
the  acceptors,  hydrogen,  and  donor  atoms  was  sub-
jected  to  the  cut-off.  Because  the  lengths  of  the  poly-
peptide  chains  of  these  three  lipases  are  different,  the 
numbers  of  hydrogen  bonds  were  also  normalized  by 
the  number  of  residues.  The  total,  as  well  as  normal-
ized,  numbers  of  hydrogen  bonds  were  larger  in  the 
case  of  mesophilic  enzymes  as  compared  with  the  psy-
chrotrophic  one.  It  is  likely  that  the  hydrogen  bonds  play 
a  significant  role  in  the  enhanced  thermostability  of 
mesophilic  enzymes.
(4)  Helix  capping
The  N-  and  C-terminal  of  an  α-helix  have  unsatisfied 
main  chain  hydrogen  bonds.  The  side  chains  of  the  first 
(N-cap)  and  the  last  (C-cap)  residues  of  an  α-helix  may 
be  able  to  provide  the  necessary  hydrogen  bonding 
partners  or  stabilize  the  helix  by  electrostatic  inter-
actions  with  the  helix  dipole.  The  characteristics  of  the 
helix  caps  in  PsLip1  in  terms  of  their  stabilizing  influ-
ence  are  similar  to  those  found  in  other  enzymes. 
(5)  Loop  insertions
Loops  are  believed  to  be  important  in  protein  stability, 
as  they  might  provide  initiation  points  for  unfolding. 
However,  PsLip1  has  only  a  single  three-residue  in-
sertion  as  compared  with  eight  insertions  of  different 
sizes  in  mesophilic  enzymes.  The  216-234  region  of  the 
longest  insertion  for  mesophilic  enzymes  (which  is  ab-
sent  in  PsLip1)  is  rather  flexible,  such  that  three  resi-
dues,  220-222,  could  not  be  seen 
the  CvLip 
structure.  It  seems  likely  that  insertions  in  mesophilic 
enzymes  will  destabilize  the  structure  as  compared  with 
PsLip1.
(6)  Disulfide  bridges
Introduction  of  disulfide  bridges  could  significantly  con-
tribute  to  protein  stability.  PsLip1  contains  two  cysteine 
residues,  105C  and  217C.  However,  the  distances  be-

tween  the  Cα  and  S  atoms  (15.6  and  16.6  Å,  re-

in 

spectively)  are  too  great  to  form  a  disulfide  bridge.  The 
absence  of  disulfide  bonds  in  PsLip1  as  compared  with 
mesophilic  lipases  containing  one  intact  disulfide  bond 
could  contribute  to  the  decreased  thermostability  of 
psychrotrophic  enzymes.
(7)  Proline  contents
The  pyrrolidon  ring  of  proline  is  believed  to  decrease  the 
backbone  entropy  of  unfolding  by  decreasing 
the 
main-chain  flexibility.  Unexpectedly,  the  number  of  pro-
line  residues  in  PsLip1  is  larger  than  that  in  its  meso-
philic  counterparts,  with  18  (PsLip1),  13  (PcLip),  and  10 
(CvLip)  prolines  residues,  respectively.  In  fact,  this  is  the 
largest  number  of  proline  residues  found  throughout  the 
5  compared  sequences.  It  seems  that  the  additional 
proline  residues  could  contribute  to  the  stabilization  of 

PsLIp1.
(8)  Arg/(Arg＋Lys)  ratio
The  molar  ratio  of  basic  residues  Arg/(Arg＋Lys)  is  equal 
to  0.32,  which  is  low  with  respect  to  the  values  for 
CvLip  (0.65)  and  PcLip  (0.56).  The  stabilizing  effect  of 
arginine  has  the  ability  to  form  more  stable  inter-
molecular  bonds  than  lysine.  Moreover,  arginine  inter-
acts  more  favorably  with  the  solvent  than  lysine  at  the 
protein-water  interface.  It  seems  that  the  number  of  sta-
bilizing  residues,  such  as  arginine,  is  reduced  in  cold- 
adapted  lipase,  which  possibly  has  a  flexible  tertiary 
structure.
    The  author  built  a  model  for  the  3D  structure  of 
PsLip1  from  Pseudomonas  sp.  B11-1,  based  on  align-
ments  of  known  structures.  The  3D  structures  of P. glu-
mae, P. cepacia,  and  C. viscosum  lipases  have  been 
solved.  The  requirement  for  a  conformational  change  in 
PsLip1  in  order  to  allow  access  to  the  active  site  has 
been  confirmed  by  calculation  and  examination  of  the 
solvent-accessible  surface.  The  orientation  demonstrates 
that  a  repositioning  of  α5  upon  activation  would  allow 
the  cavities  around  the  active  site,  thus  allowing  access 
of  the  substrate  to  the  active  site.
    A  3D  model  for  PsLip1  has  been  analyzed  for  possi-
ble  structural  reasons  for  the  decreased  thermostability 
of  the  enzyme  compared  with  its  mesophilic  counter-
parts.  As  shown  for  other  proteins  isolated  from  organ-
isms  that  are  adapted  to  grow  at  low  temperature,  a  re-
duction  in  aromatic-aromatic  interactions,  a  smaller 
number  of  hydrogen  bonds,  and  reduced  Arg/(Arg＋Lys) 
ratio  as  well  as  the  absence  of  disulfide  bridges  could 
contribute  to  decreased  thermostability.  Two  homolo-
gous 
from  mesophilic  organisms 
(CVL-CvLip  and  2LIP-PcLip)  have  been  used  for  homol-
ogy  model  construction.  The  possible  structural  reasons 
for  the  decreased  thermostability  of  psychrotrophic  en-
zymes  in  comparison  with  its  mesophilic  counterparts 
could  be  a  reduction  in  aromatic-aromatic  interactions, 
reduced  Arg/(Arg+Lys)  ratio,  a  smaller  number  of  hydro-
gen  bonds,  and  the  absence  of  a  disulfide  bridge. 
However,  PsLip1  has  more  proline  residues  and  shorter 
surface  loops,  which  could  be  regarded  as  stabilizing 
factors.  The  contribution  of  salt  bridges  to  thermo-
stability  seems  to  be  insignificant  in  this  particular  case.
This  study  may  provide  insight  into  the  factors  govern-
ing  thermal  stability  through  an  analysis  of  the  struc-
ture-stability  relationship  of  proteins  from  extrophiles 
and  a  comparison  with  their  mesophilic  counterparts.
