Cancer is the most dreaded disease in human and also major health problem worldwide. Despite its high occurrence, the 
exact molecular mechanisms of the development and progression are not fully understood. The existing cancer therapy 
based on allopathic medicine is expensive, exhibits side effects; and may also alter the normal functioning of genes. Thus, a 
non-toxic and effective mode of treatment is needed to control cancer development and progression. Some medicinal plants 
offer a safe, effective and affordable remedy to control the cancer progression. Nimbolide, a limnoid derived from the neem 
(Azadirachta indica) leaves and flowers of neem, is widely used in traditional medical practices for treating various human 
diseases. Nimbolide exhibits several pharmacological effects among which its anticancer activity is the most promising. The 
previous studies carried out over the decades have shown that nimbolide inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis of cancer 
cells. This review highlights the current knowledge on the molecular targets that contribute to the observed anticancer 
activity of nimbolide related to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest; and inhibition of signaling pathways related to 
cancer progression.

Introduction

Cancer is the most dangerous disease of human and a 
major  health  problem  worldwide  [1].  Preclinical  studies 
have shown that cancer is a large group of diseases charac-
terized by the uncontrolled cell growth and spread of abnor-
mal cells. Over the past quarter of a century, an outstanding 
progress in understanding of the proteins involved in cancer 
progression  has  grown,  providing  chances  for  identifying 
new targets for anti-cancer therapy [2, 3]. Present modes of 
treatment based on synthetic drugs have limited potential, 
because  they  are  toxic  and  expensive  and  also  alter  cell 
signaling pathways. Natural drugs that are safe, affordable, 
and effective are needed to control cancer development and 
progression. Natural products have been used for thousands 
of years in the management of several diseases including 
various types of cancer [4]. Nimbolide was first derived from 
the leaves and flowers of neem. Neem (Azadirachta indica), is 
a traditional medicinal plant of the Meliaceae family widely 

distributed in Asia, Africa and other tropical parts of the 
world. All parts of the neem tree offer amazing potential for 
medicinal, agricultural and industrial exploitation and have 
been  evaluated  for  antiinflammatory,  antipyretic,  antihis-
tamine, antifungal, antitubercular, antiprotozoal, vasodila-
tory, antimalarial, diuretic, spermicidal, antiarthritic, insect 
repellent, antifeedant, and antihormonal activities [5].

Studies  of  extracts  from  all  major  parts  of  neem  plant 
including the leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, have shown 
promising  chemopreventive  and  therapeutic  effects  in 
pre-clinical research [6]. Extracts of neem leaf have been 
reported to be non-toxic and non-mutagenic and are found to 
possess  immunomodulatory  as  well  as  anti-inflammatory 
and anticarcinogenic properties [7]. There are many studies 
showing  the  ethanolic  extract  of  neem  leaves  to  possess 
anticancer  activity.  Ethanolic  neem  leaf  extract  (ENLE) 
exhibited anticancer activity against N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- 
nitrosoguanidine-induced  oxidative  stress  and  gastric 
carcinogenesis [8]. ENLE induces apoptosis in a prostate 
cancer cell line (PC-3) by up-regulating the pro-apoptotic

ing in DNA fragmentation in prostate cancer cells [9, 10]. 
Many  bioactive  compounds  are  isolated  from  this  plant 
among which, nimbolide belongs to the limonoid group. It is 
the major component of the leaves of A. indica.

Nimbolide  (5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-diprenylflavanone),  is 
a  tetranortriterpenoid  with  a,  -unsaturated  system  and 
-lactonic ring (Fig. 1) [11]. It has been shown to exhibit 
numerous  types  of  biological  activities,  including,  anti-
malarial [12], anti-bacterial activity [13], anti-feedent, [14] 
and anticancer activities [15-19]. Literature evidence reveals 
that  ,  -unsaturated  ketone  structural  element  is  re-
sponsible for the anticancer activity of nimbolide [20, 21].

Mechanism of Action of Nimbolide in Cancer 
Prevention

Cancers  are  abnormal  cell  growth  caused  by  genomic 
modification.  So,  any  agent  that  has  anti-cancer  activity

either protects genetic material from alterations or kills the 
genetically altered cancer cells. The active component nim-
bolide  from  neem  acts  on  cancer  cells  and  kill  them  by 
altering the several molecular pathways. The cytotoxicity of 
nimbolide has been widely studied over the last several years 
in a large variety of cancer cell lines [22]. It was reported 
recently  that  nimbolide  inhibited  cancer  progression  by 
influencing multiple mechanisms, including prevention of 
procarcinogen activation and oxidative DNA damage, up-
regulation  of  antioxidant  and  induction  of  apoptosis,  in-
hibition of tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, 
and metastasis [19, 23-26]. The potential mechanisms of 
cancer  prevention  by  nimbolide  are  described  below  and 
summarized in Fig. 2.

Inhibition  of  Cancer  Cell  Proliferation  and 
Growth 

Tumorigenesis and cancer progression are thought to be 
the  result  of  some  changes  in  different  types  of  genetic 
pathways [27, 28]. Nimbolide, a chief constituent of neem, 
shows  a  vital  role  in  cancer  prevention  and  treatment 
through  the  modulation  of  various  biological  activities, 
including molecular cascades. However, understanding the 
mechanism  of  action  of  nimbolide  in  the  activation  or 
inactivation  of  genetic  pathways  will  provide  significant 
information to develop therapeutic approaches to manage 
various types of cancers.

Nimbolide  induces  in  vitro  cytotoxic  activity  against 
human  cancer  cell  lines  [20].  Nimbolide  decreased  cell 
viability, with an IC50 ranging from 4 to 10 M and averaging

6 M for the neuroblastoma (NE-115) and osteosarcoma 
(143B) cell lines [15]. Sastry et al. [21] have tested the in vitro 
cytotoxicity of nimbolide against a panel of human cancer 
cell lines. Treatment of cells with 0.5−5.0 M nimbolide 
resulted in growth inhibition of the U937, HL-60, THP1, and 
B16  cell  lines.  It  has  been  shown  to  interfere  with  the 
expression of cell survival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, IAP-1, and 
IAP-2), proliferation (cyclin D1), invasion (matrix metallo-
proteinase  [MMP]-9),  and  angiogenesis  (vascular  endo-
thelial growth factor [VEGF]) by inhibiting inhibitor of b 
(Ib)  kinase  (IKK)/nuclear  factor  kappa  B  (NF-B)  [16]. 
Nimbolide treatment to human colon carcinoma (HT-29) 
cells  at  2.5–10  M  resulted  in  moderate  to  very  strong 
growth  inhibition  [29].  Nimbolide  significantly  inhibited 
cell viability, with IC50 values of 4.0 M and 2.7 M for 24 
and 48 h, respectively, in MCF-7 cells and 6.0 M and 3.2 M 
for 24 and 48 h, respectively, in MDA-MB-231 cells [30].

The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is involved in 
the  proliferation,  survival,  and  migration  of  tumor  cells. 
IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is 
overexpressed in about 70% of breast cancers [31, 32]. It is 
established that the consequences of IGF-IR activation by its 
ligands result in the recruitment of major adapter signaling 
proteins,  such  as  src/collagen  homology  proteins,  which 
lead to interaction with Grb2/Sos [33]. Recruitment of these 
molecules activates two distinct signal transduction path-
ways. One pathway activates Ras, Raf, and mitogen-activat-
ed protein kinase (MAPK), resulting in the transcription of 
genes  that  drive  proliferation,  and  the  other  pathway 
involves phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, which are 

responsible for cell survival and anti-apoptotic signal trans-
duction [34]. Downregulation of these molecules will give 
rise to inhibition of cell survival, invasion, and induction of 
apoptosis.

Aberrant  activation  of  PI3K/Akt  signaling  has  been 
associated with the development and progression of many 
cancers [35], making this pathway an attractive target for 
therapeutic strategies. The increase in p-Akt level in breast 
tumor samples correlates with a poor prognosis [36, 37] and 
predicts a worse outcome among endocrine-treated patients 
[38].  The  major  inhibitor  of  Akt  is  the  dual-specificity 
protein and lipid phosphatase, phosphatase tensin homolog 
deleted  on  chromosome  10  (PTEN)  that  counteracts  the 
PI3K-dependent Akt activation by dephosphorylating the D3 
position of PIP3 [39]. PTEN activity is frequently lost by 
mutations, deletions or promoter methylation silencing in 
many primary and metastatic human cancers [40, 41]. The 
inhibition of PI3K/Akt and activation of the PTEN pathway 
constitute a good strategy in the prevention of cancer. 

The  recent    findings  of  Karkare  et  al.  [42]  proved  that 
nimbolide  suppresses  glioblastoma  viability  and  detains 
tumor  growth  by  inhibiting  CDK4/6  activity,  leading  to 
retinoblastoma  hypophosphorylation  and  cell  cycle  arrest 
and  by  inhibiting  growth  factor  pathways  that  are 
hyperactivated  in  glioblastoma,  including  the  PI3K-Akt, 
MAPK, and JAK-STAT pathways [42]. It has been reported 
that decreased IGF-IR expression and increased IGFBP-3 
expression are observed in nimbolide-treated breast cancer 
cells. The protein expression of the IGF signaling molecules 
IRS-2,  PI3K,  pAkt,  Ras,  Raf,  MEK,  and  MAPK  was

tion  factors  like  NF-B,  c-Myc,  and

activated, thus modulating target gene
expression.  As  most  of  the  target 
genes  are  implicated  in  cell  cycle 
regulation  and  proliferation,  the  can-

significantly  decreased  in  nimbolide-treated  cells.  This  is 
further  supported by  a significant increase in  the protein 
expression  of  PTEN  upon  nimbolide  treatment  in  breast 
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3). Thereby, nimbolide inhibits the cell 
survival  and  proliferation  of  breast  cancer  and  prostate 
cancer cells [19, 43].

The Effects of Nimbolide on NF-B Signaling

NF-B  comprises  a  family  of  transcription  factors  in-
volved  in  the  regulation  of  a  wide  variety  of  biological 
responses.  NF-B  has  a  well-known  function  in  the 
regulation  of  immune  responses  and  inflammation,  but 
growing  evidence  supports  a  major  role  in  oncogenesis. 
NF-B regulates the expression of genes involved in many 
processes  that  play  a  key  role  in  the  development  and 
progression of cancer, such as proliferation, migration, and 
apoptosis [44, 45]. This transcription factor is localized in 
the cytosol and is blocked by Ib. Activation of NF-B may 
result  from  different  signaling  pathways  triggered  by  a 
variety  of  cytokines,  growth  factors,  and  tyrosine  kinases 
[44].

Recently,  it  was  studied  that  nimbolide  exerts  potent 
anticancer  effects  in  HepG2  cells  by  inhibiting  NF-B 
activation and its downstream events, such as activation of 
the  Wnt/-catenin  pathway  and  apoptosis  evasion.  Inhi-
bitors of NF-B which can block several signalling pathway, 
have developed  as a  successful  candidates  for novel  anti-
cancer  regimens.  Thus,  nimbolide,  by  targeting  multiple 
components  of  the  NF-B  signaling  pathway  to  inhibit 
tumor  progression,  is  a  promising  agent  for  cancer  pre-
vention  and  therapy  [17].  Gupta  et  al.  [16]  found  that 
suppression of NF-B activation by nimbolide was caused by 
inhibition of IKK, which led to suppression of IB  phos-
phorylation  and  degradation,  nuclear  translocation,  DNA 
binding,  and  gene  transcription  in  myeloid  and  leukemic 
cells.  Nimbolide  significantly  decreased  the  protein  ex-
pression of IKK, IKK, and NF-B in breast cancer cell lines 
[46].

Nimbolide Inhibits Cancer Cell Metastasis

Metastasis is the process by which a cancer cell leaves the 
primary tumor, travels to a distant site via the circulatory 
system, and begins a secondary tumor. In order to meta-
stasize,  cancer  cells  must  invade  through  the  basement 
membrane and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Proteolysis 
of  the  ECM  is  an  important  step  in  metastasis,  and  the 
process is associated with the upregulated production and 
activity  of  several  ECM-degrading  proteases.  The  matrix 
metalloproteinases  (MMPs)  constitute  a  family  of  struc-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

turally  related,  zinc-dependent  endopeptidases  that  are 
capable of degrading the protein components of the ECM 
and basement membrane and release growth factors from 
ECM stores [47, 48]. MMP activity is regulated by specific 
inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs). Activation 
of  chemokines  and  the  urokinase  plasminogen  activator 
(uPA)/uPA  receptor  (uPAR)  system  is  also  a  central 
mediator of tumor-cell migration and invasion, and IGF-I 
signaling can influence the uPAR pathway.

Chemokines  are  chemotactic  cytokines  that  cause  the 
directed migration of leukocytes and are induced by inflam-
matory cytokines, growth factors, and pathogenic stimuli. 
Chemokine signaling results in the transcription of target 
genes  that  are  involved  in  cell  invasion,  motility,  and 
survival. The upregulation of chemokine molecules in tumor 
biology as compared with “normal” cells confers chemokines 
as “a magic bullet,” as targeting them can potentially hit 
cancer cells and their metastasis, leaving non-affected cells 
unharmed [49]. The expression of the chemokines CCL2, 
CXCL12, and CXCL8 and their receptors CCR2, CXCR1, 
CXCR2,  and  CXCR4  is  significantly  decreased  in  nim-
bolide-treated breast cancer cell lines [46].

uPA  is  a  serine  protease  that  is  involved  in  cancer 
progression, mainly invasion and metastasis [50]. uPA can 
be observed as a multifunctional protein that is involved in 
both  proteolysis  and  signal  transduction  [51].  Recently, 
nimbolide has been shown to interfere with the expression 
of NF-B-regulated proteins, like Bcl-2, cyclooxygenase 2, 
MMP-9, and VEGF, by inhibiting IKK. Therefore, it is likely 
that nimbolide will interfere with cell migration invasion 
and  angiogenesis  [29].  The  neem  limonoids  azadirachtin 
and nimbolide inhibit hamster cheek pouch carcinogenesis 
by  prevention  of  procarcinogen  activation  and  oxidative 
DNA damage, upregulation of antioxidants and carcinogen 
detoxification  enzymes,  and  inhibition  of  tumor  invasion 
and angiogenesis [24]. The protein expression of MMP-2 and 
-9 is significantly decreased, and TIMP-2 expression is in-
creased in nimbolide-treated breast cancer cells [46]. Other 
studies also reported that the protein expression and activity 
of MMP-2 and -9 were significantly decreased in myeloid 
leukemia  cell  lines  [16]  and  colon  cancer  cells  [29]. 
Limonoid-treated  xenografts  exhibited  significant  down-
regulation in the expression of proteins involved in tumor 
cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-IAP-1, survivin, and Mcl-1), 
proliferation (c-Myc and cyclin D1), invasion (MMP-9, inter-
cellular  adhesion  molecule  1),  metastasis  (CXCR4),  and 
angiogenesis  (VEGF)  [26].  The  migration  and  invasive 
potential of the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were 
considerably  suppressed  upon  nimbolide  treatment.  The 
results showed that nimbolide downregulated the express-
ion of uPA, uPAR, chemokines, phopho-epidermal growth

factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, NF-B, 
IKK,  IKK,  MMP-2,  and  MMP-9  and  upregulated  the 
expression  of  TIMP-2,  suggesting  that  nimbolide  inhibits 
angiogenesis and metastasis of breast cancer [46].

Inhibition  of  Cell  Cycle  and  Induction  of 
Apoptosis by Nimbolide

The  loss  of  the  ability  to  regulate  the  cell-cycle  is 
characteristic of cancer cells and results in uncontrollable 
proliferation.  Processing  cells  through  the  first  gap  (G) 
phase of the cell cycle is a step that is frequently disordered 
in cancer [52]. Nimbolide has been investigated in different 
studies for its ability to mediate cell cycle arrest. In many in 
vitro  and  in  vivo  studies,  nimbolide  has  shown  cell 
cycle-regulatory effects [18, 25, 53, 54]. It has been reported 
that nimbolide inhibits cell proliferation by interfering with 
cell cycle kinetics by inducing G0/G1 and S phase arrest, 
primarily caused through the repression of cyclin A/cyclin 
D1 [16, 54, 55].

In another interesting molecular study, a Japanese group 
has proved that nimbolide, a triterpenoid present in certain 
edible parts of A. indica, arrested HT-29 cells in the G2/M and 
G0/G1  stages  apparently  through  upregulation  of  p21, 
which is a well-known downstream effector of the p53. p53 
is a very important anticancer protein that regulates a large 
number of genes that are involved in cancer progression. 
Nimbolide has also been shown to upregulate cyclin D2 and 
CDK2 and to suppress the expression of cyclin A, cyclin E, 
CDK2, and Rad17 at the same time [53]. Flow cytometric 
analysis of U937 cells showed that nimbolide treatment (1–
2.5 M) resulted in cell cycle disruption by decreasing the 
number of cells in G0/G1 phase, with initial increases in S 
and G2/M phases. It is shown that nimbolide can affect cell 
cycle progression and induce apoptosis in colon cancer, oral 
carcinoma,  and  cervical  cancer  [18,  25,  55].  Nimbolide 
significantly suppressed the viability of HeLa cells in a dose- 
dependent manner by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 
phase,  accompanied  by  p21  accumulation  and  down- 
regulation of the cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin B, cyclin 
D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) [55].

Nimbolide treatment results in the accumulation of cells 
in G0/G1 phase and decreased in S-phase by up regulating 
p21 and downregulating the cell cycle-regulatory proteins 
cyclins and PCNA. Cyclin D1 is known as a proto-oncogene 
whose  gene  amplification  and  protein  overexpression  of 
which are frequently observed in tumor cells. The activated 
cyclin D1/CDK4 and cyclin D1/CDK6 complex phosphory-
lates the retinoblastoma protein to induce the expression of 
target  genes  essential  for  S  phase  entry,  facilitating  the 
progression  from  G1  to  S  phase  [56].  Cyclin  B1  is  a 

G2/mitotic-specific protein that plays a role in the initiation 
of  mitosis  and  tumorigenesis  [57].  It  was  reported  that 
cyclin  B1  depletion  inhibits  proliferation  and  induces 
apoptosis in human tumor cells [57]. Nimbolide treatment 
decreases cyclin (A1, B1, C, D1, and E1) expression in breast 
cancer cells. p21Waf1/Cip1, originally identified as an inhibitor 
of the cyclin/CDK complexes, has also been shown to have a 
role as an adaptor protein that assembles and promotes the 
kinase activity of cyclin D/CDK4 complexes [58]. The level 
of  p21  was  significantly  increased  in  nimbolide-treated 
breast  cancer  cell  lines.  PCNA,  a  cofactor  for  DNA  poly-
merase , plays a central role in cell cycle progression [59]. 
PCNA  is  involved  in  a  wide  range  of  cellular  functions, 
including DNA replication, repair, and epigenetic mainten-
ance, and is often used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker. 
The protein expression of PCNA is decreased in nimbolide- 
treated breast cancer cells [19]. Nimbolide directly inhibited 
CDK4/CDK6  kinase  activity,  leading  to  hypophosphory-
lation of the retinoblastoma protein, cell cycle arrest at G1-S, 
and cell death [42]. In animal tumor models, nimbolide (100 
g/kg) has been shown to exhibit chemopreventive activity 
against  7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene  (DMBA)  3-induced 
hamster  buccal  pouch  carcinogenesis  by  downregulating 
proteins  involved  in  cell  cycle  progression  and  transduce 
apoptosis by both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways [25].
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is essential for the 
maintenance  of  development  and  homeostasis  of  multi-
cellular organisms by eliminating superfluous or unwanted 
cells.  Any  alteration  or  change  in  the  normal  process  of 
apoptosis  may  increase  cell  survival  and  support  tumor 
development  and  progression  [60].  The  extrinsic  and 
intrinsic  pathways  represent  the  two  major  well-studied 
apoptotic processes. Inefficient apoptosis is considered one 
of the hallmarks of tumorigenicity [61]. Moreover, induction 
of apoptosis is an important target for cancer therapy [62]. 
The extrinsic pathway is initiated by cell surface-expressed 
death  receptors  of  the  tumor  necrosis  factor  superfamily. 
One  of  the  central  pathways  of  apoptosis  is  initiated  by 
cytokines,  such  as  tumor  necrosis  factor-,  Fas  ligand 
(FasL),  and  tumor  necrosis  factor--related  apoptosis-in-
ducing  ligand  (TRAIL)  [63].  The  intrinsic  pathway  is 
initiated by anticancer drugs, growth factor withdrawal, or 
hypoxia or via induction of oncogenes. These stimuli induce 
permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and 
activate the mitochondrial pathway [64]. 

Caspases are a family of evolutionarily conserved cysteine 
proteases  that  play  a  essential  role  in  the  majority  of 
apoptotic pathways. Death signals activate the proteolytic 
cascade of caspases through two main pathways: an extrinsic 
and intrinsic pathway [65]. Both pathways converge to the 
activation  of  caspase-3,  the  closer  homolog  of  Caenor-

160

habditis  elegans  CED-3  [66].  Caspase-3  activates  down-
stream enzymes of the caspase family and contributes with 
them to generate the typical apoptotic cell death phenotype 
[67].  Harish  Kumar  et  al.  [25]  reported  that  nimbolide 
transduces  apoptosis  by  both  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
pathways in DMBA-induced hamster buccal pouch carcino-
genesis. Working on the choriocarcinoma (BeWo) cells, have 
shown that nimbolide, induces apoptosis through engage-
ment of the mitochondrial pathway. The involvement of this 
pathway  is  based  on  the  observation  that  nimbolide 
mediates  the  upregulation  of  Apaf1  and  a  caspase-3  and 
decrease in the Bcl2/Bax ratio [54].

Nimbolide sensitizes human colon cancer cell lines (HCT- 
116 and HT-29) to TRAIL through reactive oxygen species- 
and Erk-dependent up-regulation of death receptors, p53, 
and Bax. A normal breast cell line (MCF-10A) and breast 
cancer cell lines (MCF-7) were treated with nimbolide (1–5 
M)  for  6  h,  followed  by  TRAIL  for  24  h.  The  results 
indicated  that  whereas  nimbolide  and  TRAIL  alone  were 

minimally effective in inducing apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, the 
combination of both enhanced the number of apoptotic cells 
to  42%.  Conversely,  the  combination  of  nimbolide  and 
TRAIL was unable to evoke apoptosis in the normal breast 
cell  line.  The  results  showed  a  lack  of  DR5  and  DR4 
induction  in  MCF-10A  cells  by  nimbolide,  whereas  a 
dose-dependent induction of these receptors was observed 
in MCF-7 cells [68]. The decreased expression of Bcl-2 and 
increased  expression  of  bax,  cytochrome  c,  Smac,  and 
caspases, together with changes in nuclear morphology and 
mitochondrial transmembrane potential, seen in nimbolide 
treatment and inhibition of NF-B activation by nimbolide, 
stimulate  the  intrinsic  apoptotic  pathway  in  HepG2  cells 
[17]. In another study, nimbolide repressed cell proliferation 
by  inhibiting  the  IGF1/IGF-IR–PI3K/Akt  pathway  and 
induced  apoptosis  through  the  activation  of  both  the 
extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in prostate cancer 
cells [43].

Nimbolide also induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells by 

Fig. 4. Nimbolide shows an important role in cancer prevention via inhibition of cell survival, cell cycle progression, invasion, migration
and induction of apoptosis. The diverse molecular targets influenced by nimbolide include the growth factors and their receptor, signaling
molecules, transcription factors, protein kinases, enzymes and genes regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. Red down arrow indicates
that these molecules are down-regulated by nimbolide, whereas,  green up arrow indicate that these molecules are up-regulated by nimbolide.

P  Elumalai  and  J  Arunakaran.  Nimbolide  Inhibits  Cancer  Progression

upregulating pro-apoptotic protein (Bad, Bax, FasL, FADD, 
TRAIL, and cytochrome c) expression and down-regulating 
anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and XIAP-1). 
Nimbolide activates caspase-3, -8, and -9, which favors the 
cleavage  of  poly(ADP)  ribose  polymerase  into  115-  and 
85-kDa peptides, thus inducing apoptosis in breast cancer 
cell  lines.  Further,  the  nimbolide-induced  apoptotic  cells 
were detected using DAPI and AO/EtBr dual staining. After 
treatment  with  nimbolide,  the  cells  exhibited  the  typical 
morphological  changes  associated  with  apoptosis:  cell 
shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing 
[30].  Activation  of  caspase-3,  -8,  and  -9,  suggests  that 
nimbolide  potentiated  both  the  extrinsic  and  intrinsic 
pathways  of  apoptosis  in  human breast and  colon cancer 
cells [68, 30]. The overview of all of the signaling molecules 
modulated by nimbolide is shown in Fig. 4.

Conclusion and Future Perspectives

Cancer has continually been the leading cause of death 
worldwide  for  decades.  Thus,  researchers  have  actively 
devoted  themselves  to  studying  cancer  therapeutics.  The 
present  mode  of  treatment  based  on  chemotherapy  and 
radiotherapy is very expensive and also exhibits serious side 
effects in human beings. Keeping in view the significance of 
herbs, this review is written to show the role of nimbolide in 
the  prevention  of  various  types  of  cancer  through  the 
activation  or  inactivation  of  various  signaling  pathways. 
These reported features, combined with the absence of side 
effects and being inexpensive and easy to access, neem and 
its  constituent  nimbolide  may  be  proved  very  effective 
therapeutics in the management of cancers. Nimbolide is a 
potential  chemopreventive  agent  that  is  able  to  suppress 
multiple signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis and 
hence  is  an  attractive  candidate  for  further  research. 
Currently,  nimbolide  is  undergoing  extensive  research  to 
determine the dose efficacy and administration form that 
could  enhance  its  bioavailability  and  chemopreventive 
properties. How nimbolide mediates all of these effects is 
not completely understood. However, most of the anticancer 
activities assigned to nimbolide have been based on in vitro 
studies. While in vitro studies predominantly established the 
anti-cancer effects of nimbolide on cancer cells, its efficiency 
in vivo has still to be proven.
