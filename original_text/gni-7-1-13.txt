Abstract

Osteoporosis  is  characterized  by  impaired  osteogenesis. 
BMD  is  a  major  determinant  of  bone  strength.  The  role 
of  the  VDR  gene  in  predisposition  to  primary  osteopo-
rosis  has  been  recognized.  However,  population-based 
case-control  studies  have  been  reported  controversial 
results  for  known  candidate  genes  in  an  ethnically  dis-
tinct  group.  To  determine  the  genetic  effects  of  VDR 
variants  on  osteoporosis  and  BMD,  we  directly  se-
quenced  the  VDR  gene  in  24  unrelated  Korean  in-
dividuals  and  identified  eighteen  sequence  variants.  We 
investigated  the  potential  involvement  of  eight  SNPs  in 
osteoporosis  in  postmenopausal  women  (n  =  729).  Two 

SNPs  (LD)  in  intron  2, −5294G＞C  (rs2238135)  and 
−4817G＞A  (rs17882443)  showed  the  evidence  of  as-

sociation  with  enhanced  BMD  of  the  femoral  neck 
(padditive=0.031  for  rs2238135; padditive=0.017  and pdominant= 

0.019  for  17882443).  Moreover,  VDR −4817G＞A  was 

significantly  associated  with  protective  effect  on  all  frac-
ture  risk  (precessive=0.035,  OR=0.2,  95%  CI=0.05∼0.89), 
and  tended  to  be  higher  BMD  values  at  various  proximal 

femur  sites.  Therefore,  we  suggest  that  the −4817G＞A

Introduction

    Osteoporosis  is  called  “the  silent  bone  disease”, 
characterized  by  compromised  bone  strength,  predis-
poses  individuals  to  increased  risk  of  fracture,  especially 
of  the  hip  and  vertebra  in  postmenopausal  women 
(Eisman,  1999;  Hwang et al.,  2006).  Bone  loss  from  an 
imbalanced  remodeling  between  osteoclastic  resorption 
and  osteoblastic  formation  is  observed  at  the  time  of 
menopause,  mainly  due  to  estrogen  deficiency  and  cal-
ciotropic  hormone  insufficiency  such  as  vitamin  D  (Boyle 
et al.,  2003;  Harada  &  Rodan,  2003;  Khosla,  2001). 
    Vitamin  D  effects  on  bone  are  mediated  through  the 
vitamin  D  receptor  (VDR),  a  nuclear  transcription  factor 
that  regulates  bone  formation,  bone  resorption,  and  cal-
cium  homeostasis  by  interacting  with  vitamin  D  re-
sponse  elements  (VDREs)  within  Vitamin  D  target  genes. 
Allelic  variation  in  the  VDR  gene  explains  75%  of  the 
genetic  variability  in  BMD  used  as  a  proxy  measure 
(Eisman,  1999;  Liu  et al.,  2003;  Morrison  et al.,  1994).
    Since  the  first  association  by  Morrison  et al.,  allelic 
variations  in  genetic  regulation  of  BMD  have  been  sub-
sequently  studied  in  candidate  genes  related  to  im-
portant  elements  of  bone  mineral  homeostasis,  bone  re-
modeling  and  bone  matrix  composition.  These  approach 
were  practically  performed  by  restriction  fragment  length 
polymorphisms  (RFLPs)  on  various  populations:  Cauca-
sians  (Deng et al.,  1999;  Langdahl et al.,  2000;  Quesada 
et al.,  2004),  African-Americans  (Zmuda  et al.,  1999; 
Harris  et al.,  1997),  Mexican-Americans  (Kammerer  et 
al.,  2004;  McClure et al.,  1997),  and  Asians  (Mitra et al., 
2006;  Morita  et al.,  2004;  Yamada  et al.,  2003;  Zhang 
et al.,  2004).  Ethnicity  was  shown  to  be  one  of  the  im-
portant  factors  affecting  BMD  (Liel et al.,  1988;  Wang et 
al.,  1997).  However,  controversial  results  of  interethnic 
differences  in  allele  or  genotype  distributions  for  BMD 
variation  have  been  evidently  presented,  and  a  con-

sensus  on  the  association  with  BMD  on  known  candi-
date  genes  locus  has  not  been  reached  yet  (Gamero et 
al.,  1995;  Peacock,  1995).
    In  this  study,  we  have  analyzed  the  statistical  associ-
ation  of  Vitamin  D  receptor  (VDR)  gene  polymorphisms 
with  intermediate  phenotypes  (BMD;  major  risk  factor  of 
osteoporotic  fracture)  and  fracture  (Fx)  to  address  con-
founding  differences  in  ethnic  backgrounds  involving 
sample  size  and  stochastic  variability.  We  also  per-
formed  an  analysis  of  haplotypes  in  order  to  identify  in-
teraction  of  haplogenotypes  related  with  osteoporosis.

Methods

Subjects 

follicle-stimulating  hormone 

The  study  population  was  composed  of  apparently 
healthy  postmenopausal  Korean  women  (n=729)  who 
visited  the  Asan  Medical  Center  (AMC)  in  Seoul,  Korea. 
Menopause  was  defined  as  the  absence  of  menstruation 
for  at  least  6  months  and  was  confirmed  by  measure-
ment  of  serum 
levels. 
Women  who  were  prematurely  menopausal  (aged＜40 
years)  were  excluded.  Those  who  had  taken  drugs  that 
might  affect  bone  metabolism  for  ＞6  months,  or  within 
the  previous  12  months,  were  also  excluded.  Additional-
ly,  women  were  excluded  if  they  had  any  disease  that 
might  affect  bone  metabolism.  The  mean  age  was 
58.7±7.5  years  and  the  mean  number  of  YSM  was  9.4 
±7.8  (range  1∼35)  years.

BMD  measurement
Areal  BMD  (g/cm2)  at  the  lumbar  spine  (L2-L4)  and  fem-
oral  neck  was  measured  using  dual-energy  X-ray  ab-
sorptiometry  (Lunar  equipment,  Expert  XL,  Madison, 
WIS)  in  476  women.  In  the  other  253  women,  BMD  was 
measured  using  Hologic  equipment 
(Hologic,  QDR 
4500-A,  Waltham,  MA).  The  precisions  of  the  Lunar  and 
Hologic  equipment,  presented  as  coefficient  of  varia-
tions,  were  0.82%  and  0.85%  for  the  lumbar  spine  and 
1.12%  and  1.20%  for  the  femoral  neck,  respectively. 
These  values  were  obtained  by  scanning  17  volunteers 
who  were  not  part  of  the  study;  each  volunteer  under-
went  five  scans  on  the  same  day,  getting  on  and  off  the 
table  between  examinations.  To  derive  cross-calibration 
equations  between  the  two  systems,  BMD  values  were 
measured  by  the  two  machines  in  109  healthy  Korean 
women  (mean  age  55±11,  range  31∼75  years),  and 
cross-calibration  equations  were  calculated  as  follows 
(Oldroyd  et  al.,  2003):

    L2-L4  BMD  (g/cm2):  Lunar  =  1.1287×Hologic−0.0027

    Femoral  neck  BMD  (g/cm2):  Lunar=1.1556×Hologic−

0.0182

    We  also  obtained  BMD  values  at  other  proximal  fem-
oral  sites,  all  taken  after  January  2001.  The  Hologic  ma-
chine  did  not  measure  BMD  at  the  femoral  shaft.  BMD 
values  at  the  femoral  shaft  and  at  other  proximal  femur 
sites  (trochanter,  total  femur,  Ward’s  triangle)  were 
available  for  228  and  319  participants,  respectively. 
Associations  between  these  BMD  values  and  VDR  ge-
netic  variations  were  determined  using  statistical  adjust-
ments  with  the  machine  as  a  covariate,  because  the 
cross-calibration  data  are  not  yet  available  for  Korean 
women  at  these  sites.

Sequencing  of  the  VDR  gene

the  ABI  PRISM  3730  DNA  analyzer 

We  sequenced  all  VDR  exons,  including  exon-intron 
boundaries,  and  the  promoter  region  (ca.  1.5  kb),  to  de-
tect  SNPs.  We  sequenced  24  Korean  DNA  samples  us-
ing 
(Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA).  Sixteen  primer  sets  for 
amplification  and  sequencing  analyses  were  designed 
based  on  GenBank  sequences  (Ref.  Seq.  of  VDR 
mRNA:  NM_001017535.1,  and  contig:  NT_029419.11). 
Sequence  variants  were  verified  by  automated  sequenc-
ing  chromatograms.  SNPs  were  detected  by  multiple 
alignments  of  sequences  using  the  Phred/Phrap/Consed 
package and polyphred (Ewing et al., 1998; Gordon et al., 
1998;  Nickerson  et al.,  1997).

Golden  gate  assay  for  genotyping

Genotyping  was  performed  at  a  multiplex  level  using  the 
Illumina  Golden  Gate  genotyping  system  (Oilphant et al., 
2002),  and  data  quality  was  assessed  using  duplicate 
DNAs  (n=10).  The  genotype  quality  score  for  data  re-
tention  was  set  at  0.25.  SNPs  that  could  not  satisfy  the 
following  criteria  were  excluded:  (i)  a  minimum  call  rate 
of  90%;  (ii)  no  duplicate  error;  (iii)  Hardy-Weinberg  equi-
librium  greater  than  p＞0.001. 

Statistics
    The  χ2  test  was  used  to  determine  whether  in-
dividual  variants  were  in  equilibrium  at  each  locus  in  the 
population  (Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium).  We  examined 
Lewontin’s  D'  (|D'|),  and  the  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD) 
coefficient  γ2,  between  all  pairs  of  biallelic 
loci. 
Genotypes  were  given  codes  of  0,  1,  and  2  for  the  ad-
ditive  model;  0,  1,  and  1  for  the  dominant  model;  and 
0,  0,  and  1  for  the  recessive  model.  Multiple  regression 
analyses  of  BMD  at  the  lumbar  spine  and  femoral  neck 

Association  of  VDR  Gene  Polymorphisms  in  Postmenopausal  Korean  Women    15

were  performed  using  age,  YSM,  weight,  and  height,  as 
covariates.  Associations  of  BMD  values  at  other  prox-
imal  femur  sites,  such  as  the  total  femur,  the  trochanter, 
Ward’s  triangle,  and  the  shaft,  with  VDR  genotypes, 
were  determined  after  further  statistical  adjustments 
made  necessary  by  the  choice  of  bone  densitometer, 
because  cross-calibration  data  are  not  available,  to 
date,  for  these  values  in  Korean  women.  The  genotype 
distributions  between  participants  with  or  without  frac-
ture  were  analyzed  using  a  logistic  regression  model 
controlling  for  age,  YSM,  weight,  and  height. 

Results

To  investigate  the  genetic  effects  of  VDR  variants  on 
BMD  and  osteoporosis,  we  sequenced  all  the  VDR 

exons  and  their  boundaries  including  1.5  kb  of  the  5’ 
flanking  region  and  identified  eighteen  polymorphisms 
three  were  located  in  the  promoter,  three  in  coding  re-
gions  of  exons  (two  synonymous  and  one  non-syn.), 
nine  in  the  3’-untranslated  regions  (UTRs),  and  three  in 
the  introns.  We  genotyped  the  eight  selected  SNPs  for 
association  studies  in  postmenopausal  women  (n=729). 
Clinical  profiles  and  the  correlations  between  BMD  and 
age,  weight,  height,  and  years  since  menopause  (YSM) 
are  listed  in  Table  1.  The  mean  age  of  the  participants 
was  58.7±7.5  years  (range  43∼82  years),  and  the 
mean  YSM  was  9.5±7.8  years  (range  1∼32  years).  As 
expected,  age  and  YSM  correlated  negatively  with  BMD 
at  both  the  lumbar  spine  and  femoral  neck.  Weight  and 
height  correlated  positively  with  BMD  at  both  sites.  In 
these  participants,  the  genotype  frequency  of  each  of

UTRs  with  white  blocks.  The  first  base  of  the  translation  start  site  is  denoted  nucleotide  ‘+1’.  Polymorphisms  genotyped  in
a  larger  population  (n=729).  The  frequencies  of  polymorphisms  not  subject  to  larger-scale  genotyping  were  based  on  se-
quence  data  (n=24).  (A)  Polymorphisms  identified  in VDR  on  chromosome  12q13.11  (Ref.  Genome  Seq.  NM_001017535.1).  (B)

the  eight  SNPs  studied  is  shown  in  Table  2;  genotype 
distributions  were  in  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (p＞ 

0.001). The VDR −5402G＞A, −4926A＞G, −4257G＞A, 
−3949C＞T  and  ＋34169C＞T  SNPs  were  extremely 

rare  or  monomorphic  in  our  subjects.  Four  common 
haplotypes  (freq.  ＞0.05)  in  LD  block  accounted  for 
43.0%  (ht-1),  29.0%  (ht-2),  21.9%  (ht-3)  and  5.3%  (ht-4) 
of  the  distribution,  and  were  used  for  further  analysis 
(Fig.  1).

    We  found  that  −4817G＞A  was  significantly  asso-
allele  (A)  of −4817G＞A  in  intron  region  showed  sus-

ciated  with  the  risk  of  all  fracture  (p=0.035).  The  minor 

ceptibility  to  the  risk  of  fracture  in  the  recessive  (p= 
0.035,  OR=0.2,  95%  CI=0.05∼0.89).  Consistent  with 
fracture  result,  VDR-ht3  (TCAA)  (Fig.  1B)  comprising  risk 
allele  also  showed  the  evidence  of  association  with  frac-
ture  risk  by  protective  effect  (p=0.05,  OR=0.23,  95%  CI 
=0.05-1),  although  the  statistical  significance  was  mar-
ginal  (Table  3). 

    In  logistic  regression  analysis  adjusted  for  confound-

ing  variables,  we  found  that  the VDR −4817G＞A  and 

VDR-ht3  were  significantly  associated  with  the  BMD  of 
various  proximal  femur  sites  as  well  as  femoral  neck. 

VDR −4817G＞A  (rs17882443)  showed  a  significant  as-

sociation  with  BMD  at  the  femoral  neck  (p=0.017  and 
0.019),  trochanter  (p=0.035  and  0.014),  shaft  (p=0.012 
and  0.020),  and  total  femur  (p=0.030  and  0.016)  in  the 
additive  and  dominant  models,  respectively  (Table  4).  In 

addition, −5591T＞C  in  LD  block  was  also  associated 

with  higher  BMD  of  femoral  neck  (padditive=0.031)  and 
(padditive=0.021  and  pdominant=0.018),  respectively 
shaft 
(data  not  shown).  VDR-ht3  was  associated  with  in-
creased  BMD  values  of  the  femoral  neck  (padditive=0.028 
and  pdominant=0.034),  trochanter  (padditive=0.042  and  pdo-
minant=0.017),  shaft  (padditive=0.014, pdominant=0.024  and pre-
cessive=0.039),  and  total  femur  (padditive=0.034  and pdominant 
=0.019),  respectively  (Table  4).

Discussion

In  the  present  study,  we  closely  examined VDR  gene  re-
gion  polymorphisms  for  the  association  of  the  genetic 
variations  with  fracture  risk  and  quantitative  traits  (BMD 
values).  In  this  regard,  the VDR  polymorphisms  are  ex-
pected  to  provide  more  extensive  genetic  information  for 
osteoporosis  or  its  related  fracture,  compared  with  pre-
vious  standardized  testing  such  as  RFLP  based  on  only 
four  common  endonuclease,  ApaI  (rs17879735),  BsmI 
(1544410), FokI  (17881966),  and TaqI  (rs1788009). VDR, 
an  intracellular  receptor  that  specifically  binds  the  active 
form  of  vitamin  D  (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin  D3  or  calcitriol) 

and  interacts  with  target-cell  nuclei  to  produce  a  variety 
of  biologic  effects,  contains  11  exons  and  spans  over 
41.2  kb  on  chromosome  12q13.11  (Baker et al.,  1988). 
    When  haplotype  LD  was  analyzed  based  on  the  in-
dividual  genotype  information  of  selected  SNPs,  VDR- 
ht3  was  significantly  associated  with  all  fracture  risk 
(Table  3).  Among  SNPs  of  VDR-ht3,  the  minor  allele  of 

−4817G＞A  was  also  associated  with  protective  effect 
of  fracture.  Interestingly,  the  effects  of  VDR −4817G＞A 

on  quantitative  BMD  of  the  femoral  neck  was  al-
lele-dose  dependent;  the  highest  BMD  being  found  in 
homozygotes  for  the  common  allele  (0.7±0.14),  inter-
mediate  BMD  in  heterozygotes  (0.68±0.12),  and  the 
lowest  BMD  in  homozygotes  for  the  rare  allele  (0.67±

0.11)  (Table  4).  In  addition,  both  the −4817G＞A  and 

VDR-ht3  comprising  risk  allele  also  showed  the  evidence 
of  association  with  higher  BMD  values  of  various  prox-
imal  femur  sites.
    In  our  results,  the VDR  polymorphisms  are  associated 
with  higher  BMD  of  proximal  femur  sites  as  well  as  fem-
oral  neck,  but  not  with  that  of  the  lumbar  spine.  Since 
the  femoral  shaft,  trochanter  and  total  femur  have  higher 
cortical  bone  content  that  the  lumbar  spine,  these  poly-
morphisms  may 
influence  cortical  bone  strength. 
Accordingly,  BMD  values  at  femur  neck  predict  fractures 
better  than  those  at  vertebral  BMD.  Because  the  mean 
age  of  our  subjects  was  58.7  years,  these  results  may 
have  been  due  to  osteoarthritis,  degenerative  changes 
such  as  bony  spurs,  or  aortic  calcification  which  occur 
more  often  in  the  elderly  individuals,  and  therefore  may 
have  falsely  changed  BMD  measured  by  dual  energy 
X-ray  absorptiometry  (Burger et al.,  1996).  Although  mul-
tiple  environmental  factors  are  involved  in  the  patho-
genesis  of  osteoporosis,  genetic  factors  are  also  largely 
responsible  for  bone  mass,  accounting  for  about  50-85% 
of  the  variance  in  BMD  on  the  basis  of  twin  and  family 
studies  (Arden  and  Spector,  1997;  Gueguen et al.,  1995; 
Ng et al.,  2006).  However,  the  heritability  of  fractures  has 
been  estimated  to  lie  only  between  25  and  35%  (Deng 
et al.,  2000;  MacGregor et al.,  2000),  which  is  much  low-
er  than  the  heritability  of  BMD  values,  many  fall-related 
factors  other  than  BMD  must  contribute  to  fracture  risk. 
    The  genetic  effects  of  VDR  polymorphisms  on  BMD 
are  not  dramatic.  Because  the  associated  p-values  did 
not  retain  statistical  significance  for  multiple  compari-
sons.  If  Bonferroni  correction  were  strictly  adopted,  as-
sociated  p-values  could  not  retain  all  significances. 
However,  although  there  is  a  chance  of  type  I  error  due 
to  multiple  comparisons,  when  considering  the  facts  that 

consistent positive signals at the same sites (−4817G＞A 

and  VDR-ht  3)  with  various  bone-related  phenotypes, 
the  significance  of  associations  might  be  reasonable. 
Nevertheless,  it  might  be  worthwhile  to  follow  up  on  the 
effects  of  this  important  common  gene  with  larger  co-
hort  studies,  considering  its  vital  role  in  bone  mineral 
metabolism.  Further  biological  and  functional  evidence 
would  be  needed  to  confirm  the  suggestive  association 
of  VDR  variants  with  bone-related  phenotypes.
    After  a  multitude  of  studies,  several  standardized  var-
iations  by  RFLP  have  been  investigated  for  associations 
with  fracture  and  BMD,  but  study  results  are  in  con-
sistent  (Dvomyk et al.,  2004;  Horst-Sikorska et al.,  2007; 
Kiel  et al.,  2007;  Long  et al.,  2004;  Uitterlinden  et al., 
2006).  have  performed  a  large-scale  meta-analysis  of 
studies  from  prospective  multicenter  to  investigate  the 
effect  on  fracture  incidence  of  four  restriction-frag-
ment-length  polymorphisms  (FokI,  BsmI,  ApaI,  and 

TaqI).  These  polymorphisms  were  not  associated  with 
lumbar  spine  or  femoral  neck  BMD.  However,  these  re-
sults  are  inconsistent  with  our  investigations  carried  out 
for  Korean  menopausal  women.  This  is  probably  due  to 
the  fact  that  the  study  design  did  not  examine  all VDR 
polymorphisms,  contribute  more  to  identify  genetic  risk 
factors.  Our  results  suggest  that  VDR  polymorphisms 
and  haplotypes  provide  more  genetic  information  on  os-
teoporosis  risk.
    In conclusion, we identified 18 polymorphisms of VDR in 

Korean  population,  found  that −4817G＞A  (rs17882443) 

and  VDR-ht3  were  significantly  associated  with  en-
hanced  BMD  and  fracture  risk  protection  as  genetic 
factor.  Our  observations  suggest  that  these  sequence- 
based  variants  are  candidates  for  genetic  determinants 
of  BMD  of  the  hip  in  postmenopausal  women.
