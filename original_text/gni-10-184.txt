Gastric  cancer  is  ranked  as  the  most  common  cancer  in  Koreans.  A  recent  molecular  biological  study  about  the  folate 
pathway gene revealed the correlation with a couple of cancer types. In the folate pathway, several genes are involved, 
including  methylenetetrahydrofolate  reductase  (MTHFR),  methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine  methyltransferase  reduc-
tase (MTRR), and methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase (MTR). The MTHFR gene has been reported several 
times for the correlation with gastric cancer risk. However, the association of the MTRR or MTR gene has not been reported 
to date. In this study, we investigated the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MTHFR, 
MTRR, and MTR genes and the risk of gastric cancer in Koreans. To identify the genetic association with gastric cancer, we 
selected 17 SNPs sites in folate pathway-associated genes of MTHFR, MTR, and MTRR and tested in 1,261 gastric cancer 
patients and 375 healthy controls. By genotype analysis, estimating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI), rs1801394 
in the MTRR gene showed increased risk for gastric cacner, with statistical significance both in the codominant model (odds 
ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.85) and dominant model (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75). Especially, in the obese group 
(body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2), the codominant (OR, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.01 to 94.59) and recessive model (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 0.92 
to 16.59) showed dramatically increased risk (p ＜ 0.05). In conclusion, rs1801394 in the MTRR gene is associated with 

gastric cancer risk, and its functional significance need to be validated.

Introduction

According  to  the  Korea  Central  Cancer  Registry  data, 
gastric  cancer  is  ranked  as  the  most  common  cancer  in 
Korean and men and accounted for about 20.1% of all cancers 
in Koreans. In Korea, 29,727 cases of gastric cancer were 
newly  diagnosed,  and  the  crude  incidence  rate  of  gastric 
cancer in 2009 was 59.9 per 100,000. In males, the number 
of newly  diagnosed  cases and  incidence rates  of stomach 
cancer  in  2009  were  19,953  cases  and  80.2  per  100,000, 
respectively.  The  5-year  relative  survival  rates  of  gastric 

cancers were increased by 22.5% from 42.8% in 1993-1995 
to 65.3% in 2005-2009 [1]. 

Evidence from pathology and epidemiology studies has 
provided a human model of gastric carcinogenesis with the 
following  sequential  stages:  chronic  gastritis;  atrophic 
gastritis; intestinal metaplasia; and dysplasia [2]. Also, an 
environmental element of gastric cancer occurrence exists 
plentifully.  The  best  well-known  risk  factors  for  gastric 
cancer are Helicobacter pylori infection, by far the strongest 
established risk factor for gastric cancer; a family history; and 
smoking.  Several  factors  related  to  nutrition  and  food

preservation, such as high intake of salt-preserved foods and 
dietary nitrite or low intake of fruit and vegetables, are likely 
to increase the risk of gastric cancer [3]. 

Cancerogenesis,  which  is  the  loss  of  cellular  differen-
tiation that leads the digestive tract to cancer, is inhibited by 
nutrition  factors,  such  as  retinoid,  vitamins  B-complex 
(including folate), vitamin C, D3, and E, polyphenol, fiber, 
calcium,  selenium,  and  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  (e.g., 
Omega-3)  [4].  Especially,  the  environmental  factors  in 
cancer  and  a  high  intake  of  vitamin  B-complex  play 
important roles in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation 
[5].  There  have  been  many  epidemiological  studies  that 
gastric cancer is associated with high-risk dietary profiles 
(low folate, vitamin B6 intake, and high alcohol), smoking, 
and low blood folate concentration [6-8]. 

Folate is the water-soluble form of vitamin B9 in foods [9]. 
Leafy vegetables, such as spinach, turnip greens, lettuces, 
dried beans, peas, fortified cereal products, sunflower seeds, 
and  certain  fruits,  are  rich  sources  of  folate.  The  recom-
mended dietary allowance for adults is 400 μg of food folate 
a day, which is equivalent to about 240 μg synthetic folic acid 
in supplements or fortified food. Women of child-bearing 
age planning a pregnancy should take 400 μg synthetic folic 
acid daily in addition to their normal dietary intake [10, 11]. 
There is now substantial data to support an important role 
for folate in the prevention of neural tube defects (NTDs), 
Down syndrome, vascular disease, various cancers, Alzhei-
mer’s  disease,  cognitive  function,  and  affective  disorders 
[12].  Cumulative  evidences  suggest  that  food  containing 
folate  decreases  the  risk  of  colorectal,  pancreatic,  and 
esophageal cancers [13]. Also, a western lifestyle, which is 
associated with high total caloric or fat intake (include red 
meat), and inactive life pattern, has been considered one of 
the main reasons for increasing trends of cancer in Koreans 
[14]. 

Variations in levels of serum total homocysteine (tHcy) 
can result from genetic or nutrient-related disturbances in 
the folate pathway. In this mechanism, fasting levels of tHcy 
mainly  reflect  the  remethylation  pathway.  In  the  reme-
thylation pathway, the primary methyl donor for the vitamin 
B12-dependent  conversion  of  Hcy  to  methionine  is  5- 
methlytetrahydrofolate, which in turn forms 5, 10-methly-
tetrahydrofolate by means of the enzyme methylenetetra-
hydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). 

Recent  reports  suggested  that 

individual  genetic 
variation  or  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in 
various  genes  involved  in  cellular  folate  metabolism  or 
transport may also be implicated in cancer risk. In the folate 
metabolism  pathway,  cellular  folate  act  as  donors  and 
receptors of methyl groups in the biosynthesis of nucle-
otide  precursors  used  for  DNA  synthesis  and  provide

methyl groups for methylation of DNA, RNA, and proteins 
[15].  MTHFR,  methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine  me-
thyltransferase  reductase  (MTRR),  and  methyltetrahydro-
folate-homocysteine  methyltransferase  (MTR)  genes  are 
well known for their association with the folate pathway [16, 
17].

MTHFR maps to chromosome 1p36.3 and is 2.2-kb long 
and contains 11 exons. The gene product is a 77-kD protein, 
although a smaller isoform of approximately 70 kD has been 
observed in some tissues, such as liver [18]. SNPs in MTHFR, 
such  as  C677T  (rs1801133),  A1298C  (rs1801131),  and 
G1793A (rs2274976), have been suggested to be associated 
with  several  cancers  (colon,  gastric,  and  breast),  cardio-
vascular disease, NTDs, and pregnancy complications [6, 9, 
19-21].  In  cancer  patients,  higher  sensitivity  to  5-fluo-
rouracil (5-FU) among patients carrying the MTHFR 677TT 
and  1298AA  genotypes  compared  to  the  others  was 
reported, demonstrating a strong predictive ability of these 
polymorphisms in response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy in 
gastric cancer [22, 23].

The  MTRR  gene  was  mapped  to  human  chromosome 
5p15.3-p15.2, is 34 kb  long, comprises 15 exons, has 22 
codon SNP (cSNP) variation sites, and is thought to produce 
cytosolic  and  mitochondrial  mRNA  isoforms  [24,  25]. 
Polymorphisms in MTRR－rs1801394 (A66G), rs1532268 
(S175L), and rs10380 (H595Y)－have been associated with 
the risk of cancers (breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic, and 
acute  lymphoblastic  leukemia),  Down  syndrome,  and 
Alzheimer disease [26-31]. The MTR gene maps to human 
chromosome 1q42, is 105 kb, comprises 33 exons, and has 
116  SNP  variation  sites.  One  polymorphism  in  MTR 
(rs1805087) has been associated with colorectal cancer and 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk [8, 32].

For gastric cancer, a genetic variation in MTHFR has been 
recently reported [33, 34]. Also, case-control studies with 
specific results on folate intake (or blood concentration) and 
gastric cancer risk suggest a protective role in a couple of 
reports [35, 36]. The MTR or MTRR gene variations were 
associated with colorectal and pancreatic cancer risk [8, 37], 
but there has been no report on gastric cancer. In this study, 
we investigated the association between polymorphisms in 
MTHFR, MTRR, and MTR and the risk of gastric cancer in 
Koreans.

DNA extraction and sample preparation

DNA was extracted from 350 μL of whole blood using the 
MagAttract DNA Blood Midi M48 Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, 
USA) using a Qiagen BioRobot M48 workstation, according 
to the manufacturer’s protocols automatically. The purity 
and concentration of isolated DNA were determined by a 
Nanodrop  ND-1000 
(Nanodrop 
Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE,  USA).  We  needed  more 
detailed quantity of each sample for genotyping reaction; so, 
we  measured  the  quantity  of  DNA  using  the  Quant-iT 
PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Invitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) and made a dry plate for genotyping reactions with 10 
ng per well of 384 plates.

Primer selection and assay design

Seventeen  SNPs  in  MTHFR,  MTRR,  and  MTR  were 
selected, covering previously studied SNPs, such as C677T 
(rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) in MTHFR [29] and 
A66G  (rs1801394)  in  MTR  [27].  The  SNP  information, 
including nucleic acid sequences, was collected from dbSNP 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/;  Build  136). 
SNPs in coding regions and promoters were chosen at first. 
Regulatory SNPs with validated allele frequency and non- 
synonymous cSNPs were finally included. Multiplexed PCR 
primers  were  designed  for  the  best  PCR  reaction  and 
designed for evading the biophysical hurdle  － secondary 
structure, self-ligation, competition of primers, etc. － using

MassARRAY Assay Designer version 3.0 (Sequenom, Inc., 
San Diego, CA, USA) (Table 2). 

PCR amplification

PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 5 μL 
with 10 ng of genomic DNA, 1.625 mM MgCl2, 0.1 units of 
HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen), 0.5 mM dNTPs (Invitro-
gen, Inc.), and 100 nM primers. The PCR reactions started at 
94oC for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94oC for 20 s, 50oC 
for 30 s, and 72oC for 1 min, with a final extension of 72oC for 
3 min.

Genotyping

Genotyping was carried out using the iPLEX assay on the 
MassARRAY Platform (Sequenom, Inc.). The iPLEX exten-
sion was performed in a total volume of 9 μL with 50 μM 
dNTP/dideoxynucleotide  phosphate  (ddNTP)  each,  0.063 
unit/μL Thermo Sequenase (Sequenom, Inc.), and 625 nM 
to  1.25  μM  extension  primers.  iPLEX  extension  was 
performed  using  2-step  200  short-cycle  programs.  The 
sample  was  denatured  at  94oC  for  5  s,  and  strands  were 
annealed at 52°C for 5 s and extended at 80°C for 5 s. The 
annealing and extension cycle was repeated 4 more times for 
a total of 5 cycles, looped back to a 94°C denaturing step for 
5 s, and then entered the 5-cycle annealing and extension 
loop again. The 5 annealing and extension steps with the 
single denaturing step were repeated an additional 39 times 
for a total of 40 cycles. A final extension was done at 72°C for 
3 min. iPLEX extension products were desalted by adding 6 
mg resin (SpectroCLEAN; Sequenom, Inc.) and 16 μL water. 

After full rotation in room temperature, the reaction mixture 
was centrifuged at 3,500 g, 5 min. After desalting, products 
were  transferred  to  SpectroCHIP  using  a  Nanodispenser 
(SpectroPOINT;  Sequenom,  Inc.)  and  then  read  through 
matrix-assisted  laser  desorption/ionization  time-of-flight 
(SpectroReader;  Sequenom,  Inc.).  The  resulting  genotype 
data were collected by MassArray Typer software version 4.0 
(Sequenom, Inc.).

Statistical analysis

The  chi-square  test  for  association  was  used  to  test 
differences  of  genotype  frequencies  between  normal  and 
gastric  cancer  patients.  Odds  ratios  (OR)  and  their  95% 
confidence intervals (CI) in relation to MTHFR, MTTRR, and 
MTR genotypes were calculated. Also, after adjustment for 
sex,  family  history,  smoking,  drinking,  and  H.  pylori 
infection,  global  chi-square  test  was  also  employed  to 
calculate OR and their 95% CIs for individuals. Statistical 
analyses  were  performed  using  SAS  version  9.0  (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Association between folate pathway genes and 
gastric cancer risk

had a minor allele frequency less than 5%. For each SNP, the 
p-value of χ2-test and OR were calculated (Table 3). 

Significant  associations  between  genotypes  of  folate 
pathway  SNPs  and  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer  were  only 
observed  for  rs1801394  (p  ＜ 0.05).  In  rs1801394,  the 
frequencies of the AG heterozygote genotype were 0.411 and 
0.366 in patients and control groups, respectively. The risk of 
gastric cancer in patients with the risk allele was increased as 
OR, 1.39 (codominant model; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.85) or OR, 
1.34 (dominant model; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.75) with statistical 
significance (p ＜ 0.05).

Association between folate pathway genes and 
obese gastric cancer patients

Further, the association between the 17 SNPs of folate 
pathway  genes  and  gastric  cancer  risk  was  analyzed  and 
stratified by obesity categories (BMI, ＜25 vs. ≥25) (Table 
4). 

Interestingly,  the  risk  of  rs1801394  was  dramatically 
increased for the codominant model (OR, 9.08; 95% CI, 1.01 
to  94.59;  p  ＜ 0.05)  only  among  obese  subjects.  For  the 
dominant model, the OR was also increased with statistical 
significance (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.06 to 3.49; p ＜ 0.05). Also, 
the recessive model showed significantly higher risk (OR, 
3.72; 95% CI, 0.92 to 16.59). Additionally, we analyzed the 
correlation  among  family  history,  H.  pylori  infection,  and 
folate gene SNPs but did not find any significant association 

(data not shown). 

Discussion

For early detection and diagnosis of cancer, the discovery 
of  new  biomarkers  is  very  important,  and  the  interest  of 
researchers  is  growing  rapidly.  Also,  genetic  factors,  in-
cluding polymorphisms of genes involved in tumorigenesis, 
may partly explain the difference in individual susceptibility 
to cancer [38]. In the present study, we studied the impact of 
folate pathway gene polymorphisms on the risk of gastric 
cancer in a Korean population. Since folic acid was a critical 
cofactor  in  one-carbon  metabolism  involving  in  the  bio-
logical methylation and nucleotide synthesis pathways, our 
study may find clues for the possible effect to dietary effects 
on gastric cancer.

In  the  report  of  previous  studies,  the  frequency  of 
genotypes for MTHFR was similar with our results-less than 
5% for many SNPs [39, 40]. For MTHFR, one study found the 
association  of  rs1801133  with  gastric  cancer  risk  but  no 
association  of  rs1801131  [34]. However,  different results 
have been reported in other studies, showing no association 
for either SNP with gastric cancer [33]. We also found no 
association of either SNP with gastric cancer risk, which is 
concordant with the results of Kim’s group [33]. For MTR, 
although  a  couple  of  reports  have  shown  a  significant 
association between the polymorphism of MTR and the risk 

190

www.genominfo.org

of certain cancers [32], we could not find any association in 
our study population of gastric cancer. 

In  our  study,  a  significant  association  of  rs1801394 
(A66G) in MTRR was found, especially with high OR among 
the  obese  gastric  cancer  group.  MTRR  regenerates  a 
functional methionine synthase via reductive methylation so 
that methionine synthase can catalyze methionine synthesis, 
which  is  an  essential  amino  acid  required  for  protein 
synthesis and one-carbon metabolism. The A66G polymor-
phism  is  reported  to  be  functional,  so  that  the  variant 
enzyme has a lower affinity for MTR [41]. A large number of 
studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  role  of 
rs1801394 in different kinds of cancers; the results are still 
plausible.  One  meta-analysis  reported  that  the  A66G 
polymorphism  should  contribute  to  tumor  susceptibility, 
showing significantly increased risk among Asians with the 
G allele, which is also in concordance with our result [42]. 
Our  result  is  biologically  plausible,  since  the  poly-
morphisms or gene-environment interactions, rather than 
folate intake alone, would have an impact on the risk for 
digestive  track  cancer,  because  functional  SNPs  in  folate- 
related genes were known to contribute to the alteration of 
folate metabolism [30]. The SNPs in folate pathway genes 
(such as MTHFR) were reported to influence to the decrease 
of  the  activity  of  the  enzyme,  leading  to  hyperhomo-
cysteinemia,  particularly  in  folate-deficient  states  [43]. 
Homocysteine was related to cancer formation, like tumor 
necrosis factor, obesity, and the folate pathway, and is known 
to be one of the main risk factors for distal gastric cancer, 
including  H.  pylori  infection  and  dietary  factors  [44]. 
Although obesity (BMI > 25) was more prevalent in patients 
with cardia cancer compared to patients with gastric distal 
cancer  in  Koreans  [45],  a  previous  study  reported  that 
obesity  is  a  major  risk  factor  for  several  types  of  cancer, 
including gastric cancer [46]. Also, many epidemiological 
studies have shown that obesity is a risk factor for breast 
cancer, colon and kidney cancer, and malignant adenomas of 
the  esophagus.  Obesity  subjects  have  an  approximately 
1.5-3.5-fold  increased  risk  of  developing  these  cancers 
compared with normal-weight subjects [47]. 

Here, we report the association of genetic variations in 
MTRR with the risk of gastric cancer for the first time. In 
further studies, we need to validate our finding in a larger 
population,  considering  detailed  clinical  information,  and 
study  the  functional  relevance  of  polymorphisms  with 
cancer development more. Also, we need to consider other 
genes in the folate pathway and investigate gastric cancer 
susceptibility  with  epidemiological  and  environmental 
factors (e.g., nutrition intake, 5-FU drug interference, blood 
folate concentration, etc.).
