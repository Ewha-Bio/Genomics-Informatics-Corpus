Abstract

We  have  developed  WinBioDBs  with  Windows  inter-
faces,  which  include  importing  modules  and  searching 
interfaces  for  10  major  public  databases  such  as 
GenBank,  PIR,  SwissProt,  Pathway,  EPD,  ENZYME, 
REBASE,  Prosite,  Blocks,  and  Pfam.  User  databases 
can  be  constructed  with  searching  results  of  queries 
and  their  entries  can  be  edited.  The  program  is  a 
stand-alone  database  searching  program  on  Windows 
PC.  Database  update  features  are  supported  by  import-
ing  raw  database  files  and  indexing  after  downloading 
them.  Users  can  adjust  their  own  searching  environ-
ments  and  report  format  and  construct  their  own  proj-
ects  consisting  of  a  combination  of  a  local  databases. 
WinBioDBs  are  implemented  with  VC++  and  its  data-
base  is  based  on  MySQL.

Availability:  The  detailed  features  of  this  system  are 
available 
from  http://www.smallsoft.co.kr/product/Win-
BioDBs/index.html.

for  saving  and  searching  the  searched  results.  Users 
can  import  and  update  the  major  databases  with  Win-
dows  interfaces  and  can  manipulate  their  own  local  da-
tabases  with  searched  results.

Features  and  Results

The  detailed  features  of  WinBioDBs  are  as  follows.
    ㆍWindows  program 
    ㆍsupporting  the  search  of  10  major  biological  data-
bases  (Table  1)  including  large  databases  like  Gen-
Bank

    ㆍsearching  and  formatting  the  results
    ㆍlocal  databases  for  the  searched  results
    ㆍediting  and  searching  local  databases
    ㆍcustomization  of  search  conditions  for  each  data-

base

    ㆍcustomization  of  output  fields  for  each  database
    ㆍproject  features  -  multiple  local  databases
    ㆍupdating  public  DB
    ㆍbackup  of  local  databases
    The  database  schema  of  WinBioDBs  is  a  little  compli-
cated  (Fig.  1)  to  support  the  complicated  features  (Fig. 
2).  Database  information  table  is  a  meta  table  and  each 
of  10  major  public  databases  constructs  a  public  DB  ta-
ble  and  a  private  DB  table.

Discussion

Introduction

WinBioDB  is  a  Windows  program  with  diverse  and 

Many  biological  databases  are  supported  in  commercial 
softwares  or  via  web  interfaces.  Entrez  and  SRS,  which 
are  provided  with  web  interfaces,  are  known  as  the 
most  popular  and  powerful  programs  for  this  purpose. 
While  users  usually  need  to  save  searched  results,  most 
programs  do  not  support  the  features.
    We  have  developed  a  Windows  program,  WinBioDBs, 
which  provides  searching  10  major  databases,  GenBank

unique  features  as  a  PC-based  program.  With  more 
practical  requirements  through  user  tests,  it  will  be  up-
graded  to  a  more  useful  database  program.  It  could  in-
clude  more  public  databases  and  could  be  integrated 
with  analysis  programs.
    As  WinBioDBs  use  MySQL  as  its  database  engine, 
the  server  version  programs  can  be  easily  constructed 
by  just  changing  the  database  server  while  using  its 
Windows  interfaces.
