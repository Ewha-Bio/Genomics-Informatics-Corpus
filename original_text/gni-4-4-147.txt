Abstract 
GATA transcription  factors  are  widespread  eukaryotic 
regulators whose DNA-binding domain is a class IV zinc 
finger motif in the form C~CX17-2oC~C followed by a basic 
region.  In fungi,  they act as transcriptional activators or 
repressors in several different processes,  ranging from 
nitrogen source utilization to mating-type switching. Using 
an in-house bioinformatics portal system, we surveyed 50 
fungal  and  9  out-group  genomes  and  identified  396 
putative fungal GATA transcription factors. The proportion 
of GAT A  transcription  factors  within  a  genome  varied 
among  taxonomic  lineages.  Subsequent  analyses  of 
phylogenetic  relationships  among  the  fungal  GAT A 
transcription factors,  as well  as a study of their domain 
architecture  and  gene  structure,  demonstrated  high 
deg~ees of conservation in type IVa and type IVb zinc finger 
motifs and the existence of distinctive clusters at least at 
the  level  of  subphylum.  The  SFH 1  subgroup  with  a 
20-residue loop was  newly identified,  in  addition to six 
well-defined subgroups in the subphylum Pezizomycotina. 
Furthermore, a novel GATA motif with a 21-residue loop 
(CX2CX21CX2C,  designated  'zinc finger type  IVc')  was 
discovered within the phylum Basidiomycota. Our results 
suggest that fungal GAT A factors might have undergone 
multiple distinct modes of evolution resulting in diversified 
cellular modulation in fungi.

Introduction 
GATA transcription factors (TFs) are a family of regulatory 
proteins widespread in eukaryotes. They contain one or 
two highly conserved type IV zinc finger motifs (CX2CX17 
-2oCX2C) followed  by a basic region that recognize and 
bind to a consensus DNA sequence, WGATAR (W=Tor 
A;  R=G  or  A),  of  target  genes  (Scazzocchio,  2000). 
Based on the spacing between the cysteine pairs at the 
zinc  finger  loop,  the  zinc  finger  motifs  have  been 
categorized into two groups: those with 17 -residue loops 
(CX2CX17CX2C  zinc  finger  type  IVa)  and  those  with 
18-residue  loops  (CX2CX1aCX2C  zinc  finger  type  IVb 
Teakle and Gilmartin, 1998). The DNA-binding domains 
of characterized metazoan GAT A TFs always have type 
IVa zinc fingers with a leucine in the seventh position of 
the  loop.  In  vertebrates,  six  distinct  GATA  TFs  are 
well-defined and they play critical  roles in development, 
differentiation, and control of cell proliferation (for review, 
see  Lowry  and  Atchley,  2000).  In  contrast,  all  the 
characterized  GATA factors  in  plants  contain  type  IVb 
zinc finger motifs with either leucine or glutamine in the 
seventh  position  of the  loop and  an  additional  residue 
lysine in position 16. Plant GATA TFs have been implicated 
in  light-dependent  and  nitrate-dependent  control  of 
transcription, although their in vivo functions remain very 
poorly understood (for review, see Reyes et a/.,  2004 ). 
In fungi, all GATA TFs contain a highly conserved zinc 
finger DNA-binding domain and the majority of the fungal 
GATA  TFs  fall  into  two  different  categories:  one  is 
'animal-like' and the second is 'plant-like.' The residue at 
position seven of plant-like fungal GATA factors is glutamic 
acid. Fungal GATA TFs are involved in diverse functions 
~uch  as  nitrogen  control,  siderophore  biosynthesis, 
light-regulated photomorphogenesis, circadian regulation, 
and mating-type switching (Scazzocchio, 2000). Recently, 
20- and  19-residue  zinc  finger  loops  were  found  in 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Maxon and Herskowitz, 2001) 
and Candida a/bicans (Munchow eta/., 2002), respectively. 
Fungal and plant GATA TFs typically contain a single zinc 
finger, and animal GA TA TFs typically have two or more 
zinc  fingers,  although  exceptions  occur  (Teakle  and 
Gilmartin, 1998; Scazzocchio, 2000; Reyes eta/., 2004 ). 
Since  the  completion  of the  S.  cerevisiae  genome 
sequencing project in 1996, over 50 other fungal genome 
sequences  including  Neurospora  crassa  (Borkovich  et 
a/., 2004 ), lv1agnaporthe grisea (Dean eta/., 2005), Aspergillus

nidutans  (Galagan  et  at.,  2005),  and  Ustitago  maydis 
(Kamper et al., 2006) have been completed at a phenomenal 
rate,  and  another  20  projects  are  underway.  These 
projects have generated considerable nurrbers of hypothetical 
proteins  with  as-yet-undefined  biological 
functions, 
indicating that accurate automated annotation techniques 
and  functional  prediction  are  critical  to  fungal  genome 
annotation and function analysis. 

In this study, we constructed a pipeline that catalogs 
and annotates predicted functions of hypothetical proteins 
through an in-tlOUSe bioinformatics portal system (CROSSFPP; 
Park  et  at.,  unpublished).  The  CROSSFPP  system 
provides a common gateway to access genome databases 
and  bioinformatics  tools  like  lnterPro,  ClustaiW,  and 
BLAST.  Using  our  pipeline  system,  we  conducted  a 
genome-wide~ suNey of GATA TF-related sequences in 50 
fungal species and 9 out-group species, and identified 396 
putative  fun!~al  GATA  TFs.  Subsequent  analyses  of 
evolutionary relationships among the fungal  GATA TFs 
demonstrated that type IVa and type IVb zinc finger motifs 
are highly conseNed,  and GATA TFs in the subphylum 
Pezizomycotina can  be classified  into seven distinctive 
phylogenetic  subgroups,  including  a  newly  identified 
SFH1subgroupwith a 20-residue loop. In addition, a novel 
GATArnotifVvith a 21-residue loop (CX?CX11CX?C, designated 
'zinc finger type IVc') was discovered within the phylum 
Basidiomycota. Our results suggest that fungal GAT A TFs 
underwent  multiple  distinct  modes  of evolution  such  as 
selective  loss  or  duplication,  or  sequence  divergence. 
Furthermore, we provide a new strategy to predict the putative 
roles of GATA TFs by comparative genomics analysis. 

Materials and Methods 
Identification of GATA TFs 
Genome sequences of 50 fungi and 9 out-groups were used 
for analysis of fungal  GAT A TFs and their phylogenetic 
relationships.  Species  and  database  origins  of the  59 
genome  sequences  are  listed  in  Table  1.  For  efficient 
analyses,  the·  diversely formatted  59  genome  datasets 
were standardized to the same format and integrated into a 
dedicated database (MySQL database) in which each protein 
sequence of an annotated gene was treated as an object in 
a single pipeline (Fig.  1 ).  The standardization process was 
applied to chromosome (or contig) sequences and nucleotide 
sequences of annotated genes. 

Putative GATA TFs were identified using lnterProScan 
(Zdobnov and Apweiler, 2001) installed in the CROSSFPP 
system (Fig.  1; Park et at., unpublished). In total, 740,984 
annotated protein sequences retrieved from 59 genome 
databases  (470,617  from  50  fungal  genomes)  were

genes  from  59  genome  sequences  and  scanned  using 
lnterPro  to  identify  putative  GATA  transcription  factors. 
Selected  transcription  factors  were  subjected  to  domain

scanned  for domains denoted  "GATA·type zinc finger" 
with  accession  number  IPR000679.  The  results  were 
stored  in  the  lnterPro  annotation  database  in  the 
CROSSFPP  system  for  further  analysis  and  all  data 
collected in this study are available at http://ftfd.snu.ac.kr/ 
GAT AI. Selected proteins were verified as true GAT A TFs 
by several criteria, for example, the length of GAT A motifs 
(>40 amino acids), the three-dimensional structure of zinc 
fingers using SWISS-MODEL (Schwede et at., 2003), and 
the  existence  of  similar  motifs  like  the  Arf  GTPase 
activating domain (Vitale et at.,  1998). 

Multiple  sequence  alignment  and  phylogenetic 
analysis 
Amino acid sequences of GATA TFs were aligned using 
ClustaiW  1.83  (Thompson  et  at.,  1994)  and  MEGA3 
(Kumar et at., 2004 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed 
by the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) and 
vievl.ed in Tree\/iewX (http://darwin.zaology.gla. ac.ukl-rpage/ 
treeviewx/index.htmi).AII  sequence alignments were tested 
with a bootstrap method using 10,000 repetitions. 

BLAST search for further analyses of homologous 
genes 
BLAST  searches  (McGinnis  and  Madden,  2004)  were 
carried out to find genes/proteins with sequence similarity 

A Comparative Genome-Wide Analysis of GATA Transcription Factors in  Fungi  149 

to the identified GATA TFs. Fifty-nine individual species 
datasets and  one  combined  dataset were created  and 
used in various BLAST searches. Thee-value threshold 
was set at 1 e-1 0 due to the innate similarity of GATA motifs 
around 1e-7. 

Analysis of domain architecture and exon-intron 
structure of GATA TFs 
lnterspecies  comparison  of  identified  GATA TFs  was 
performed at the domain architecture and gene structure 
levels.  Domain  architecture  information  on  predicted 
GATA TFs was obtained from lnterProScan. Annotated 
DNA-binding  domains  and  other  functional  domains 
were  graphically  displayed  over  full-length  proteins. 
Gene structures of the GATA TFs were also graphically 
visualized  using  exon  and  intron  information  provided 
from genome databases. 

Results and Discussion 
Identification of GATA transcription factors among 
50 fungal species 
Fifty-nine publicly available genome sequences, including 
50 fungal  species,  were  incorporated  into  a  dedicated 
database in a standardized format to manipulate different 
forms  of  data  with  the  same  pipeline.  Genes  with 
IPR000679  denoted  as  "GATA-type  zinc  finger"  were 
retrieved and their putative structures were analyzed via 
SWISS-MODEL (Fig.  1 ). Through this process, 396 genes 
from 50 fungal species, 159 genes from 3 plant and 4 animal 
species, and 1 gene from two oomycetes were identified 
as GATA TFs (Table 1). The number of fungal GATA TFs 
in each species ranged from 3 to 16, which is relatively 
fewer than in  plant and metazoan species. The average 
number of GATA TFs in seven species belonging to the 
phylum  Basidiomycota  was  about  9.9,  and  that  of 
Rhizopus oryzae (the phylum Zygomycota) was 37,  the 
largest number of GATA TFs in a single fungus species. 
Species belonging to the phylum Ascomycota contained 
about 6.9 GATA TFs on average. The average number of 
GATA TFs among the three subphyla within the phylum 
Ascornycota was similar; i.e., the subphyla Taphrinornycotina, 
Saccaromycotina,  and  Pezizomycotina  contained  on 
average  4  (1  species),  7.7  (22  species),  and  6.2  (19 
species) GATA TFs, respectively. However, the proportion 
of GATA TFs within the genome in each species differed 
betvveen the subphyla Saccharornycotina and Pezizornycotina 
(Fig.  2).  GATA  TFs  in  Saccharomycotina  represented 
0.12% of the genome content on average, ranging from 0.08 
to 0.21%. The percentage in Pezizornycotina ranged from 0.04 
to 0.08%, with an average of 0.05%, which is one-third of

that in Saccharomycotina. This result shows that GA TA TFs 
in Pezizomycotina might have increased their complexity 
rather than number in order to modulate more diversified 
cellular processes. 

Phylogenetic analysis of fungal GATA factors 
A phylogenetic tree of all  556 GATA factors identified in 
this  study was constructed  in  an  attempt to  reveal  the 
relationships among putative GAT A TFs, in particular the 
phylogenetic position of fungal GAT A TFs relative to those 
of animals and plants. In agreement with previous studies 
(Teakle  and  Gilmartin,  1998  Scazzocchio,  2000),  the 
phylogenetic positions of fungal GATA TFs were different 
from those of animal and plant GATA TFs. Most fell into 
independent clusters.  When their domain  arrangement 
was  examined,  animal  GATA  TFs  from  four  species 
contained additional  domains for DNA binding,  like the 
C2H2  zinc finger and  Myb DNA-binding domain,  but not 

150  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 4(4) 147-160, December2006 

additional domains for different functions. However, plant 
GATA TFs from three species included additional domains 
for different functions, like a CCT domain involved in light 
signal transduction (Hayama and  Coupland,  2003),  but 
none for DNA binding. Similar to plant GATA TFs, fungal

Fig. 3. Simplified phylogenetic tree of GATA transcription factors 
from thesubphylum Pezizomycotina, with S.  cerevisiae and C. 
albicans. Full-length protein sequences were used to construct 
a phylogenetic tree bootstrap values from 10,000 replicates are 
shown.  Members  of Pezizomycotina  in  sevensubgroups  are 
indicated  with  bold  lines.  The  scale  bar  corresponds  to  0.1 
estimated amino acid substitutions per site. 

GATA TFs  also  contained  extra  domains  with  various 
functions, such as PAS, which acts as a sensor in many 
signaling proteins (Hefti et at., 2004 ), and were devoid of 
other DNA-binding domains. Interestingly, only one GATA 
TF  was  identified  in  Phytophthora  scifae  and  none  in 
Phytophthora  infestans  (Table  1 ).  A  further  analysis 
indicated that these two oomycetes also lacked fungal(cid:173)
specific transcription factors like APSES proteins (data not 
shown; Sheppard et at., 2005), supporting the idea that the 
oomycetous  Phytophthora  species,  which  were  once 
classified as fungi, are the most distantly related organisms 
from true fungi  (James et at.,  2006). 

Within  the  kingdom  Fungi,  GATA  TFs  exhibited 
different  properties  in  different  phyla.  In  the  phylum 
Zygomycota, which is thought to be basal to Ascomycota 
and Basidiom;cota (Cavailer-Snith, 1987), R ayzaeappeared 
to  possess  the  largest  number  of  GATA  TFs  among 
fungi  (Table  1)  and  showed  a  different  evolutionary 
preference from others. Since only one Zygomycota has 
been  sequenced  to  date,  most GAT A  TFs failed  to  be 
grouped with any other fungal GATA TFs; only 12 of 37 
were grouped in three clusters. Further analyses of their 
domain architecture and gene structums suggest that R. 
oryzae  might  have  undergone  several  duplication 
events at a relatively early stage. 

In  the  phylum  Basidiomycota,  69  GATA  TFs  were 
identified  from  seven  genome  sequonces  (Table  1 ), 
among  which  only  Urbs 1 of  U.  maydis  and  Cwc2  of 
Cryptococcus  neoformans  have  been  characterized 
(Voisard et at.,  1993, Lu et at.,  2005). Those GATA TFs 
formed seven clusters: two including GATA TFs from other 
phyla and with a known function, and five including GATA 
TFs only within this phylum and without any previously 
defined  GATA TFs.  Consistent  with  its  function  in  the 
regulation of ferrichrome-type siderophore biosynthesis 
(Voisard  et at.,  1993),  U.  maydis  Urbs1  was  loosely 
clustered  with  other fungal  siderophore-regulating  TFs 
(the SRP group in Fig. 3). C. neoformans C:mc2, homologous 
to  N.  crassa  WC-2  (Lu  et al.,  2005;  discussed  below), 
assembled with other WC-2-Iike GA TA TFs (the WC2 group 
in Fig. 3). 

The GATA TFs of 42 species belonging to the phylum 
Ascomycota were assembled into distinctive phylogenetic 
clusters, which were well supported by high bootstrap values 
at the level of subphylum. While most dustr:lrs induded GA TA 
TFs  from  both  subphyla  Pezizomycotina  (filamentous 
asc:aT¥cetes) and 8aa::llaraTycxJtina (yeast fam~es), 
several  GAT A  TFs  were  observed  only  in  a  specific 
subphylum.  In  Pezizomycotina,  a  new  group  of  GATA 
transcription factor, SFH1, was identified in addition to six 
subgroups of well-defined GAT A TFs all seven subgroups 
are extensively discussed below. In Saccharomycotina,

Fig.  4.  Oomc:1in  architecture  and  gene  structure  of  selected  GATA  factors  representing  seven  P_hylogenetic  ~ubgroups in 
subphylum Pezizomycotina and yeast. The domain architecture and gene structure of 27 GATA transcnpt1on fact~rs 1n  subphyl~m 
Pezizomycotina are shown with those of S.  cerevisiae.  Locations of GAT A-type z1nc finger doma1ns,  PAS doma1ns,  PAC mot1fs, 
and/or proline-rich regions are illustratedwith different patterns. In the gene structure sect1on, an open box represents an exon and 
a black box indicates a GATA motif. 

two  subgroups  comprising  SRD1  and  ECM23,  and 
GAT3-and  GAT4-Iike  GATA  Tfs  were  found  only  in 
Saccharomyces species, while a subgroup of GAT A TFs 
(tentatively named Y1 ), including orf19.1150 of C. albicans 
and CTRG03475.3 of C.  tropicalis, appeared to be present 
only in Candi<'la species.  As described below in detail, the 
biological  functions of Srd1p,  Ecm23p,  Gat3p,  and Gat4p 
have  been  dE!fined  in  S.  cerevisiae,  but  those  of the  Y1 
Candida-specific GA TA TFs have not been characterized to 
date.  Schizosaccharomyces  pombe  of  the  subphylum 
Taphrinomycotina  contained  only  four  GATA  TFs.  They 
barely clustered with other fungal GA TA TFs, suggesting their 
distant phylogenetic relationship within the fungi. 

GATA TFs of Pezizomycotina 
The GA.TA lFsof19species in the subphylum Pezizomycotina 
(filamentous ascomycetes) encompassing four classes 
were  analyzed  further.  These  included  two  species 
(Botrytis cinerea and Sclerotinia scterotiorum) belonging 
to the class Leotiomycetes;  five speciE!S  of Aspergillus, 
Coccidioides  immitis,  Histoplasma  capsulatum,  and 
Uncinocarpus reesii belonging to the class Eurotiomycetes; 
three  species of Fusarium,  Chaetomium gtobosum,  M. 
grisea, N. crassa, Podospora anserina, and Trichoderma 
reesei  belonging  to  the  class  Sordariomycetes;  and 
Stagnospora nodotvm belonging to the class Dothideomycetes 
(Table 1 ). Two representative species (S. cerevisiae and 

A Comparative Genome-Wide Analysis of GATA Transcription Factors in Fungi  153 

identified 

C.  a/bicans) in the subphylum Saccharomycotina (yeast 
form  ascomycetes) were also  included for comparison 
(Fig.  3). A total of 117 GATA TFs was retrieved from 19 
species,  with  an  average of 6  GAT A TFs per species, 
ranging  from  3  to  9.  The  distribution  of GATA TFs  in 
Sordariomycetes  and  Eurotiomycetes  was  different, 
where an average of 7 (ranging from 4 to 9) and 5 (ranging 
from 3 to 6) GATA TFs were identified, respectively. Seven 
phylogenetic  subgroups  were 
from  a 
phylogenetic tree with full-length sequences and named 
SRP, NIT2, ASD4, WC1, WC2, NSDD, and SFH1. A similar 
tree structure was obtained when the domain sequences 
were  used.  Most  GATA  TFs  in  Pezizomycotina  were 
distributed  evenly  to  the  first  six  subgroups,  enabling 
prediction of their functions in other species. Two clades 
were  found  within  each  subgroup,  reflecting  already 
constructed taxonomic structures at the class level. These 
data suggest that these clades of GAT A TFs emerged 
before  divergence  into  classes,  and  then  evolved  in 
different ways. The SFH1  subgroup with 11  GATA TFs was 
newly  identified  in  this  comprehensive  analysis  and 
named after Sfh1p, a new Snf5p paralog (Cao eta/., 1997). 
GATA TFs in this subgroup contained a SNF5/SMARCB1/ 
INI1  domain constituting the Swi/Snffamily of chromatin(cid:173)
remodeling complex inS. cerevisiae (Kiochendler-Yeivin 
and Yaniv, 2001 ). The biological functions of SFH1  GATA 
factors  in  filamentous  ascomycetes  have  not yet  been 
characterized. 

The  GATA  TFs  in  each  subgroup  were  highly 
conserved  not only in  amino acid  sequence  but also in 
domain  arrangement and  gene structure  (Fig.  4).  Most 
subgroups  had  one  zinc finger  motif,  except  the  SRP 
subgroup  with  two  type  IVa  zinc  finger  motifs.  The 
location  of the  zinc  finger  motif was  conserved  within 
each  subgroup.  Zinc finger motifs were  mostly located 
near the C-terminus, with those of SRP slightly biased to 
the  N-terminal  and  those  of  ASD4  varying  among 
species. Four subgroups had an additional domain other 
than  a  GATA-type  zinc finger,  a  proline-rich  region  in 
NsdD, three PAS domains in WC-1, one PAS domain in 
WC-2,  and  SNF5/SMARCB1/INI1  in  Sfh1p.  The ASD4 
group had a leucine zipper, implicated in protein-protein 
interactions not yet compiled into the lnterPro database. 
In  contrast,  additional domains were rarely identified in 
GATA TFs from Saccharomycotina. Additional domains 
with  functions  other  than  DNA  binding  were  also 
identified in plant GATA TFs (Reyes eta/., 2004). These 
data  seem  to  support  modular  evolution  of  different 
groups of GATA TFs that is,  GATA zinc finger domains 
might  be  integrated  in  different  templates  with  other 
domains  (Riechmann  et  a/.,  2000).  GATA  TFs  in  the 
same  subgroup  also  shared  similar  gene  structure, 

which  was clearly demonstrated  in  the SRP subgroup. 
Three exons and two introns comprised this subgroup of 
GATA  TFs  in  each  species,  in  which  two  zinc  finger 
motifs spanning two adjacent exons interfered with each 
intron. 
SRP 
Seventeen GATA TFs were grouped with the SRE of N. 
crassa,  suggesting  a  role  in  siderophore  biosynthesis 
and  regulation,  while  C.  globosum  did  not  have  this 
subgroup  of GAT A  TFs.  SreA  acts  as  a  repressor  of 
siderophore  biosynthesis  (Eisendle  et  at.,  2003)  and 
SRE  is  known  to  act  as  a  negative  regulator  of  iron 
transport.  SidA  (L-orhithine-N5-oxygenase)  and  SidC 
(peptide synthetase), the other two enzymes implicated 
in siderophore biosynthesis in A. nidulans (Haas, 2003), 
were  also  well  distributed  among  the  fungal  species 
(data not shown). 
NIT2 and ASD4 
Four GATA TFs are known to regulate nitrogen metabolism 
in  S.  cerevisiae, two of which act positively (Gin3p and 
Gat1 p ), and the other two negatively (Dal80p and Deh1 p; 
Cunningham eta/., 2000; Oliveira eta/., 2003). Homologs 
of these two subgroups were identified and extensively 
characterized  in  N.  crassa  and  A.  nidulans.  NIT2  and 
AREA, homologs of Gln3p, functioned as major nitrogen 
regulatory  proteins  in  N.  crassa  and  A.  nidulans, 
respectively (Tao and Marzluf, 1999; Morozov eta/., 2001 ). 
NIT2-Iike GAT A factors were present in 18 species, except 
H.capsu/atum. NIT2 is known to interact with the Zn(II)Cys6 
binudear transcription factor NIT 4 (NCU08294.2) to regulate 
expression of nit-3, encoding nitrate reductase (Feng and 
Marzluf, 1998; Mo and Marzluf, 2003). NIT 4 homologs were 
also  identified  in  19  fungal  species,  indicating  that  the 
regulatory  machinery  of  nitrogen  metabolism  may  be 
conserved in Pezizomycotina (data not shown). 

The  involvement  of  Dal80p  homologs  in  nitrogen 
metabolism 
is  controversial.  NREB  of  Penicillium 
chrysogenumwas  reported  to  be  involved  in  nitrogen 
metabolism, as was NRE, a Gln3p homolog (Haas eta/., 
1997).  ARES  also  partially  complemented  the  areA 
phenotype in A. nidulans (Conlon et at., 2001 ), but ASD4 
in  N.  crassa was not implicated  in  this cellular process 
(Feng  et at.,  2000).  However,  ASD4-Iike GATA factors 
were  conserved  among  the  Pezizomycotina.  Only 
Aspergillus terreus did not have this subgroup of GAT A 
TFs. All  ASD4 orthologs,  except that in  H.  capsulatum, 
were predicted to contain the conserved leucine zipper 
motif,  which  may  be 
in  protein-protein 
interactions, leaving the possibility of homo- or heterodimer 
formation for functioning. Homo- or heterodimerization of 
Dal80p and Deh 1 p of S.  cerevisiae has been reported by 

involved

at.,  1997;  Lee  et at.,  2000).  WC-1  contains  three  PAS 
domains and WC-2 has one. The number and structure of 
domains were  conserved  among  the  WC-1  and  WC-2 
orthologs identified,  except those in Aspergillus oryzae 
(Fig.  4).  The  most  extreme  N-terminal  PAS  domain  of 
WC-1  belongs to a specialized class known as LOV (light, 
oxygen,  or  voltage)  domains  and  acts  as  blue-light 
photoreceptor (reviewed in Cheng eta/., 2003; Crosson 
et at., 2003). Eleven flavin-contacting residues found in the 
LOV domain of phototropins, the plant blue-light photoreceptors 
for phototrophism, were also well conserved among WC-1 
homologs from  14 species.  Recently,  MgWC-1  was also 
reported to act as blue-light receptor in M grisea, regulating 
asexual spore development and release (Lee eta/., 2006). 
The  existence  of a circadian  clock  in  Aspergillus was 
reported, along with the homologs LreAand LreB (Greene 
eta/., 2003). Overall sequence similarity was higher among 
members within  the  same  class,  i.e.,  Eurotiomycetes  in 
which Aspergillus resides and Sordariomycetes in which 
Neurospora and Magnaporthe reside (data not shown). In 
addition, FRQ orthologs serving as circadian oscillators in 
N.  crassa (Loros eta/., 1986 Lee et at.,  2000) were only 
found  in  nine  Sordariomycetes  species.  These  results 
suggest that fungal species within Sordariomycetes may 
be subject to a similar light regulation as that in N.  crassa, 
while  supporting  previous  reports  that  the  Aspergillus 
circadian  clock  has  different  properties  than  the  well 
described N.  crassa clock (Greene eta/., 2003). 
NSDD 
Fifteen  GAT A TFs from  14 species were grouped with 
NsdD of A. nidulans, which is involved in activating sexual 
development (Han eta/., 2001 ). NsdD homologs were not 
in  five  species:  C.  globosum,  Fusarium 
identified 
graminearum,  Fusarium so/ani,  S.  sc/erotiorum,  and  U. 
reesii.  The NsdD of A.  nidulans consisted of 461  amino 
acids with one type IVb GATA zinc finger domain near the 
C-terminus,  and  was rich  in  proline (11.3%) and  serine 
(13.4%).  GATA  TFs  in  this  subgroup  shared  a similar 
primary structure, except those in B. cinerea (BC1 G _1 0441.1) 
and M.  grisea (MGG_07319.5). These two GATA factors 
consisted  of  about  130  amino  acids,  suggesting  the 
possibility of an incorrect gene model. However, the GATA 
TFs  retrieved  from  the  same  class  were  more  closely 
related,  in spite of the length variation. This subgroup of 
GATA TFs was distantly related to GAT2 (YMR136W) of 
S.  cerevisiae, whose function remains unknown. 
SFH1 as a novel subgroup in filamentous fungi 
Several  GATA TFs comprised  a new highly conserved 
cluster.  Eleven members belong to this subgroup. All of 
them have an evolutionarily highly conserve:l SNF5'SI'Jl6RCB1/ 
INI1  domain  (IPR006939),  a  component  of  the  yeast

two-hybrid  analysis  (Svetlov  and  Cooper,  1998).  The 
GATA and IHucine zipper motifs consisted of 53 and 21 
amino acids (aa),  respectively,  and were arranged in a 
conserved  manner  with  similar  spacing  (109-126  aa) 
among species, irrespective of their location (Fig. SA). The 
amino acid sequences of zinc finger and  leucine zipper 
regions werH also highly conserved among species (Fig. 
58 and SC). 
WC1 andWC2 
Fifteen  and  16 GATA TFs were grouped together with 
WHITE  COLLAR-1  (WC-1)  and  WC-2  of  N.  crassa, 
respectively. C. globosum contained a WC-1  ortholog and 
a WC-2-Iike protein missing the GA TA motif. C. immitis and 
U.  reesii possessed  neither WC-1  nor WC-2 orthologs, 
while P.  ans6'rina appeared to lack WC-2. WC-1  and WC-2 
are essential components for light responses,  including 
entrainment of the circadian clock inN. crassa, which are 
mediated by the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains (Linden et 

A Comparative Genome-Wide Analysis of GATA Transcription Factors in  Fungi  155 

SWI/SNF complex (Kiochendler-Yeivin and Yaniv, 2001). 
Because the SNF5 domain contained most of the amino 
acids of these GAT A TFs, we searched for proteins with 
IPR006939 in the fungal genomes. Of 37 genes with an 
SNF5 domain from filamentous ascomycetes,  11  had a 
GATA type  zinc finger  motif near the C-terminus  after 
subsequent domain  analysis,  and  these  resided  in the 
same clade with SFH1  of S.  cerevisiae, one of two yeast 
homologs of human  SNF5/INI1.  SFH1  consists  of the 
chromatin remodeling RSC complex, which is known to 
interact  with  kinetochore  components 
in 
chromosome segregation during the G2-M transition and 
to  play  a  role  in  reconfiguring  cetromeric  and  flanking 
nucleosomes (Cao et at.,  1997).  Interestingly,  a  GATA 
motif along with the adjacent highly basic region was not 
found in SFH1  homologs from Eurotiomycetes or in SFH1 
itself. These results again support the modular evolution 
of GATA domains during evolution, conferring functions 
in addition to chromatin remodeling. The spacing between 
two cysteine pairs at zinc finger loops in all members was 
20 amino acid residues, forming a different type of zinc 
finger motif (type IVc). 

involved 

GATA factors of Saccharomycotina 
A total of 173 putative GAT A TFs were identified from 23 
yeast genome sequences, including nine Saccharomyces 
and  six  Candida  genomes  (Table  1 ).  Each  species  of 
Saccharomyces possesses ten GAT A TFs (Table 1) and 
rmst have been well defined in S. cerevisiae. Saccharomyces 
kluyveri  and  two  S.  cerevisiae  strains,  RM11a  and 
Y JM789, contained only two and seven annotated GATA 
TFs in their genomes, respectively (Table 1 ). However, this 
outcome was likely due to the limitation of automated gene 
prediction  algorithms  rather  than  to  strain  divergence. 
When explored using BLAST searches, for example, the 
genomes  of the  two  S.  cerevisiae  variants  contained 
unannotated GATA TFs whose protein sequences were 
almost identical to the counterparts in the S.  cerevisiae 
288C genome. 

indicated 

Our  phylogenetic  analysis 

that  70 
Saccharomyces  GATA  TFs  were  categorized  into  six 
subgroups:  NIT2  (Gin3p  and  Gat1p  of S.  cerevisiae), 
ASD4 (Gzf3p and Dal80p of S. cerevisiae), NSDD (Gat2p 
of S. cerevisiae), ASH1  (Ash1pof S. cerevisiae), SRD1/ECIV123 
(Srd1p and Ecm23p of S.  cerevisiae),  and GAT3/GAT4 
(Gat3p and Gat4p of S.  cerevisiae). While the first three 
subgroups  and  the  ASH 1  subgroup  were  shared  by 
filamentous fungal and Candida species, respectively, the 
SRD1/ECM23 and GAT3/GAT4 subgroups were found only 
in Saccharomycesspecies. Although their precise biological 
functions  remain  undefined,  Srd1 p  of  S.  cerevisiaeis 

related to pre-rRNA processing (Fabian eta/., 1990), and 
Ecm23p, previously known as Srd2p, is associated with 
pseudohyphal growth (Canizares et at.,  2002). Gat3p of 
S. cerevisiae in the GA T3 subgroup is responsible for the 
selective  use  of  good  over  poor  nitrogen  sources 
(Banerjee and Zhang, 2003), and the role of Gat4p needs 
to be characterized. Interestingly, the SRP-type GATA TF, 
well  conserved throughout the fungi,  was lacking in this 
genus and the closely related Kluyveromyces. 

Candida  afbicans  has  a  relatively  large  number  of 
GAT A TFs compared to other Candida species (Table 1 ). 
Forty-nine  GAT A  TFs  from  six  Candia  species  were 
grouped  into  six  subgroups:  the  Candida-specific  Y1, 
SRP,  NIT2, ASD4,  NSDD, and ASH1  groups. Although 
ASH1  GATA TFs are conserved in Saccharomyces and 
Candida species, they have evolved different functions. 
Even with the sequence similarity, Ash 1 p of S. cerevisiae 
represses HO expression in the daughter cell responsible 
for mating-type switching (Cosma, 2004), but CaASH1  of 
C.  albicans  controls  filamentous  growth  and  virulence 
{Inglis  and  Johnson,  2002).  The  Y1  Candida-specific 
GATA TFs have not been characterized. 

In addition, except those of S. pombe, which belongs 
to Taphrinomycotina, GATA TFs from other saprophytic 
yeasts have a tendency to assemble with Saccharomyces 
GATA TFs. In S. pombe, four GATA TFs were identified, 
among which only Fep1, which encodes an iron-sensing 
transcription factor (Pelletier eta/., 2003), was distantly 
related to SFU 1, the SRP of C. a/bicans (La net at., 2004 ). 

GATA motif analysis 
GATA motifs are typically classified into two groups based 
on the spacing between two cysteine pairs at the zinc finger 
loop: type IVa (C~CX17C~C) and type IVb (C~CX1sC~C). 
Fungal  species contain  both types of zinc finger loops, 
while  animals  have  only  type  IVa  and  plants  have 
exclusively  type  IVb  (Teakle  and  Gilmartin,  1998).  To 
decipher the distribution and relationship of GAT A motifs 
in fungi, 442 motifs from 396 GATA TFs were retrieved from 
50 fungal genomes. In addition, 184 motifs from 159 GATA 
TFs were also retrieved from four animal and three plant 
genomes for comparative analysis. Forty-six fungal GATA 
TFs,  including  siderophore  regulatory  proteins  in  A. 
nidulans (SREA) and N.  crassa (SRE), had two motifs. Of 
the fungal GATA TFs, 233 (52.7%) were type IVa and 139 
(31.4%) were type IVb. 

When  type  IVa  GAT A  motifs were  phylogenetically 
analyzed,  three clear clades were  identified:  one each 
specific to fungi or animals, and one for both fungal and 
animal  GATA  TFs  (Fig.  6A).  NIT2,  ASD4,  and  SRP 
C-terminal  GATA  motifs  were  grouped  in  the  fungal-

156  Genomics & Informatics  Vol.  4(4) 147-160, December2006 

clade, suggesting that they might have evolved separately 
after a duplication event (Caddick and Arst,  1990). 

GATA motifs of proteins belonging to the WC1, WC2, 
and  NSDD subgroups were  identified  as type  IVb  and 
grouped  separately  from  plant  type  IVb  (Fig.  6B). 
NP _ 587966.1 of S. pombe had the type IVb motif, but was 
not grouped in the fungal clade.  It remains to be determined 
whether  the  type  IVb  motif  in  Taphrinomycotina  is 
independently placed and/or is the bridge between fungal 
and plant clades. 
New GATA motifs of type /Vc 
In  addition to type IVa and  IVb, several GATA TFs with 
19- or  20-residue  motifs  have  been  found  in  plants 
(Reyes  et  at.,  2004)  and  fungi  belonging  to  the 
subphylum  Saccharomycotina (Munchow et at.,  2002). 
ASH1  in  S.  cerevisiae  has  a  20-residue  motif and  its 
DNA-binding  ability was  shown  by  a  DNA footprinting 
experiment (Maxon and  Herskowitz,  2001 ).  CaASH1  in 
C.  a/bicans has a  19-residue motif that also binds DNA 
(Munchow et at.,  2002). 

Fifty-six GATA motifs from 50 fungal genomes were 
found to have 19- or 20-residues.  In  addition, six motifs 
having 21-residues were also identified in fungal  GATA 
TFs, but not in plants and animals. Based on our findings, 
the 19- to 21-residue type GATA motif, C~-4CX19-21C~C. 
was collectively named type IVc. Type IVc motifs were also 
found in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, but not 
in humans or mice (Table 1 ).  In fungi, type IVc motifs were 
in  GAT A  TFs  from  the  phyla  Zygomycota, 
found 
Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. However, the frequency 
varied among fungal taxonomic groups. Basidiomycetes 
showed the highest proportion of type IVc GATA motifs 
(24.3%),  followed  by  Sacchromycotina  (17.3%)  and 
Pezizomycotina (7.5%). 

When  type  IVc  GATA motifs  were  phylogenetically 
analyzed, fungal type IVc motifs were grouped apart from 
plant GAT A factors (bootstrap value, 99.45; Fig. 7). GATA 
motifs of subphylum Saccharomycotina had  19 and 20 
residues.  Multiple  sequence  alignment  of these  motifs 
suggests the gain or loss of one amino acid at position 14 
between the two cysteine pairs in the zinc finger loop. In 
Basidiomycota, six unique 21-residue GATA motifs were 
found in three strains of C. neoformans, and these grouped 
together with 20-residue motifs in the same clade. The 19-
and 20-residue motifs of yeast also grouped together and 
have  been  characterized  as  transcription  factors  with 
DNA-binding  ability  (Maxon  and  Herskowitz,  2001; 
Munchow et at., 2002). These results strongly support the 
hypothesis that 21-residue type IVc motifs found in this 
study could be classified as transcription factors. 

In Pezizomycotina, all GATA TFs with type IVc motifs 
had an additional domain of SNF5/SMAI~CB1/INI1. With

highly  conserved  domain  architecture,  sequences  of 
GATA motifs were also well conserved (Fig. 78). Except 
for NP  588001.1  in S. pombe, 75% of the loop sequences 
were  highly  conserved  among  the  11  GAT A  motifs. 
Schizosaccharomyces  japonica,  for  which  annotation 
data are not publicly available, has similar GATA factors, 
with the SNF5/SMARCB1/IN11  domain showing 66.9% 
amino  acid  identity.  These  facts  strongly  suggest that 
Pezizomycotina-specific type IVc motifs share a common 
ancestor with Taphrinomycotina. 

With an exponential  increase in the  number of fully 
sequenced genomes, determining the biological functions 
of hypothetical  proteins  from  genomic sequences  has 
become a  central  goal  of bioinformatics.  Based  on the 
assumption that proteins that function in a similar pathway 
are likely to evolve in a correlated fashion, our phylogenetic 

profiling and comparative analysis of 396 putativeGATA 
factors  from  50  complete  fungal  genome  sequences 
strongly  support  comparative  phylogenomics  as  an 
alternative  strategy for in  silica functional  prediction  of 
uncharacterized genes, using evolutionary analysis at the 
genome-wide level. Thus, we have provided not only an 
inventory of fungal GATA transcription factors, but also a 
platform  for  comparative  genomic  analyses  of  other 
transcription factor families.
