Abstract

Autosomal  dominant  polycystic  kidney  disease  (ADPKD) 
is  characterized  by  formation  of  multiple  fluid-filled  cysts 
that  expand  over  time  and  destroy  renal  architecture. 
The  proteins  encoded  by  the  PKD1 and  PKD2 genes, 
mutations  in  which  account  for  nearly  all  cases  of 
ADPKD,  may  help  guard  against  cystogenesis.  Previously 
developed  mouse  models  of  PKD1 and  PKD2 demon-
strated  an  embryonic  lethal  phenotype  and  massive  cyst 
formation  in  the  kidney,  indicating  that PKD1 and PKD2 
probably  play  important  roles  during  normal  renal  tubu-
lar  development.  However,  their  precise  role  in  develop-
ment  and  the  cellular  mechanisms  of  cyst  formation  in-
duced  by PKD1 and PKD2 mutations  are  not  fully  under-
stood.  To  address  this  question,  we  presently  created 
Pkd2  knockout  and  PKD2 transgenic  mouse  embryo 
fibroblasts.  We  used  a  mouse  oligonucleotide  microarray 
to  identify  messenger  RNAs  whose  expression  was  al-
tered  by  the  overexpression  of  the PKD2 or  knockout  of 
the  Pkd2.  The  majority  of  identified  mutations  was  in-
volved  in  critical  biological  processes,  such  as  metabo-
lism,  transcription,  cell  adhesion,  cell  cycle,  and  signal 
transduction.  Herein,  we  confirmed  differential  expres-
sions  of  several  genes  including  aquaporin-1,  according 
to  different  PKD2 expression  levels  in  ADPKD mouse 
models,  through  microarray  analysis.  These  data  may  be 
helpful  in  PKD2-related  mechanisms  of  ADPKD patho-
genesis.

Introduction

Autosomal  dominant  polycystic  kidney  disease  (ADPKD) 
is  a  common  monogenetic  disorder,  affecting  as  many 
as  1  in  500  people  in  the  general  population.  The  dis-
ease  is  characterized  by  the  formation  of  multiple  flu-
id-filled  renal  cysts  that  expand  over  time  and  destroy 
the  architecture  of  the  kidney.  Five  percent  of  all  cases 
of  chronic  renal  failure  are  due  to  ADPKD,  and  approx-
imately  50%  of  ADPKD  patients  will  develop  end-stage 
renal  disease  by  the  time  they  are  60  years  of  age  [1].
    In  the  early  stages  of  ADPKD,  numerous  cysts  begin 
to  enlarge  from  many  segments  of  the  kidney.  Later,  the 
enlarged  regions  disassociate  from  the  original  nephron 
to  form  the  actual  cysts,  which  continue  to  enlarge  due 
to  proliferation  of  epithelial  cells  and  fluid  secretion  into 
the  cyst  lumen.  Progressive  renal  cyst  formation  and  en-
largement  result  in  a  loss  of  renal  function  and  hyper-
tension  and  culminate  in  renal  failure.  It  is  generally  be-
lieved  that  cysts  enlarge  by  means  of  abnormal  cell 
growth,  forming  what  is  essentially  a  fluid-filled  tumor 
that  fills  by  transepithelial  fluid  secretion.  Cyst  enlarge-
ment  may  then  lead  to  extracellular  matrix  remodeling, 
interstitial  fibrosis,  a  general  inflammatory  response,  and 
disruption  of  the  normal  renal  parenchyma,  which  then 
interfere  with  glomerular  filtration  and  vascular  blood 
flow,  giving  rise  to  cell  death  by  apoptosis  and  ulti-
mately  renal  failure  [2].
    Many  studies  have  indicated  that  most  cases  of 
ADPKD  are  accounted  for  by  mutations  in  the  PKD1 
and  PKD2 genes,  encoding  the  transmembrane  protein 
polycystin-1  (PC1)  and  polycystin-2  (PC2),  respectively. 
Mice  with  targeted  mutations  in  the PKD1 or PKD2 genes 
develop  cystic  kidneys  during  embryogenesis,  and 
ADPKD  in  humans  is  associated  with  mutations  in  the 
PKD1 or PKD2 genes  [3,  4].  In  addition,  the  product  of 
the  PKD1 gene,  PC1,  has  been  implicated  in  a  variety 
of  pathways  tied  to  proliferation,  including  G-protein  sig-
naling  and  the  Wnt,  activator  protein  1  (AP-1),  and 
Janus  kinase-signal  transducers  and  activators  of  tran-
scription  cascades  [5,  6].  Moreover,  depletion  of  PC1 
has  been  shown  to  increase  cell  growth,  whereas  its 
overexpression  slows  cell  growth,  indicating  that  PC1 
may  negatively  regulate  cell  proliferation  [7,  8].  PC2,  the 
protein  product  of  PKD2,  has  also  been  implicated  in 
cell  cycle  regulation  via  its  calcium  channel  activity  and 
stimulation  of  AP-1  [9,  10];  however,  there  has  been  lit-
tle  direct  evidence  tying  PC2  to  this  process.

    Here,  we  created  a  number  of  related  cell  lines  that 
varied  in  their  expression  of  PC2.  We  describe  studies 
designed  to  identify  target  genes  under  the  control  of 
the  PKD2 using  Pkd2 knockout  (KO)  and  PKD2 trans-
genic  (TG)  mouse  embryo  fibroblasts  (MEFs).  We  used 
a  mouse  30  K  whole  gene  oligonucleotide  microarray  to 
identify  messenger  RNAs  whose  expression  was  altered 
by  the  overexpression  of  the PKD2 or  KO  of  the Pkd2 
in  MEF  cells. 

Methods

Establishment  of  MEF  derived  from  wild-type 
and  PKD2  mutation  embryos

MEF  were  acquired  from PKD2 TG  embryos  or Pkd2 KO 
embryos  during  development  (13.5  days)  [11].  Heads 
and  limes  were  removed  from  embryos.  The  remaining 
embryonic  tissues  were  minced  and  dispersed  in  0.05% 
trypsin  prior  to  incubation  at  37oC  for  15  min.  Cells 
were  plated  in  Dulbecco's  Modified  Eagle’s  Medium  of 
Defined  Minimal  Essential  medium  (Welgene  Biotech, 
Taipei,  Taiwan)  supplemented  with  10%  fetal  bovine  se-
rum  (Welgene  Biotech)  and  were  cultured  at  37oC  in  an 
atmosphere  of  5%  CO2  until  confluent  growth  was 
achieved.  MEF  cells  were  frozen  as  stocks  at  the  sec-
ond  passage  and  were  used  for  the  subsequent  studies 
at  the  third  passage.

Microrray  hybridization  and  data  analysis

Total  RNA  was  prepared  using  a  commercial  kit  (Qiagen, 
Valancia,  CA,  USA)  according  to  the  manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Gene  expression  profiles  were  obtained  us-
ing  the  CodeLink  Uniset  Mouse  Expression  Bioarray 
(Amersham,  Buckinghamshire,  UK).  The  30,000  gene 
probes  contained  in  the  bioarray  allows  the  detection  of 
differences  in  gene  expression  as  low  as  1.3-fold  with 
95%  confidence.  Ten  micrograms  of  total  RNA  was  am-
plified,  and  labeled  cDNA  was  produced.  Biotin-labeled 
cDNA  was  hybridized  to  the  array  overnight  in  a  shaking 
incubator  at  37oC,  and  excess  target  sequences  were 
washed  away  using  a  series  of  saline  sodium  citrate   
washes.  The  array  was  stained  by  treatment  with  strep-
tavidin-Alexaflour  647  (Molecular  Probes,  Eugene,  OR, 
USA),  the  excess  was  washed  away,  and  the  array  was 
scanned  at  an  excitation  wavelength  of  632  nm  using  a 
GenePix  scanner  (Molecular  Devices,  Sunnyvale,  CA, 
USA).  The  resulting  image  was  quantified,  and  the  in-
tensity  of  each  spot  was  divided  by  the  median  spot  in-
tensity  to  provide  a  scaled  and  comparable  number 
across  multiple  arrays. 

Differential  Expression  Pattern  in  ADPKD 17

DNA  microarray  scanning  and  analysis 

Microarrays  were  scanned  using  an  Arraywox  scanner 
(Applied  Precision,  Seattle,  WA,  USA),  analyzed  using 
ImaGene  version  5.1  software  (Biodiscovery,  Segundo, 
CA,  USA),  and  normalized  using  Genesight  version  3.2 
software  (Biodiscovery).  Normalization  was  performed  by 
subtracting  the  means  of  all  genes.  The  data  normalized 
by  Genesight  were  compared  using  an  M/A  plot.  Genes 
differentially  expressed  were  identified  by  intensity  dif-
ferences,  after  subtracting  the  background  intensity. 
Genes  showing  expression  changes  of  at  least  2-fold 
were  selected,  and  these  selected  genes  were  clustered 
by  the  hierarchical  method.

Clustering  algorithm

The  normalized  log  ratio  corresponding  to  each  time 
point  was  exported  to  the  software  for  clustering  algori-
thm.  Acuity  version  3.1  (Molecular  Devices)  was  used  for 
the  ‘gene  shaving’  algorithm.  To  estimate  the  number  of 
clusters  in  a  dataset,  the  ‘Gap  Statistics’  attribute  of  the 
Acuity  software  package  was  used.  The  cluster  number, 
estimated  by  gap  statistics,  was  used  for  an  input  pa-
rameter  in  gene  shaving.  After  gene  shaving,  a  single 
linkage  was  used  for  hierarchical  clustering.

Semi-quantitative  and  real-time  RT-PCR

Total  RNA  was  prepared  using  a  commercial  kit  (Qiagen) 
according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions.  Single- 
strand  cDNA  was  synthesized  by  incubating  5 μg  total 
RNA  with  200  units  AMV,  100  nM  oligo(dT)12-18,  1  mM 
dNTP  mixture,  and  40  units  RNase  inhibitor  at  42oC  for 
1  h  in  a  final  volume  of  25 μL.  The  reaction  was  termi-
nated  by  incubation  at  70oC  for  15  min.  The  initial 
amount  of  mRNA  and  reaction  conditions  were  optimized 
to  obtain  linearity  for  mouse 18s rRNA.  For  semi-quanti-
tative  reverse  transcription  (RT)-PCR,  the  used  primers 
were: human PKD2, forward 5’-CGTGCCCCAGCCCAGTC- 
3’  and  reverse  5’-TTCCAGTACAGCCCATCCAATAAG-3’; 
mouse  Pkd2,  forward  5’-TGCGAGGGCTGCGAGGTC-3’ 
and  reverse  5’-  TGTCAGCTTGCGTGTGGTTGC-3’;  mouse 
18s rRNA,  forward  5’-GTAACCCGTTGCACCCCATT-3’ 
and  reverse  5’-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3’.  RT-PCR 
cycling  conditions  were  as  follows:  10  min  at  95oC,  25 
cycles  of  50  s  at  94oC,  50  s  at  57oC,  50  s  at  72oC,  and 
5  min  at  72oC.  The  amplified  products  were  separated 
on  a  1%  agarose  gel.  For  real-time  PCR,  the  used  pri-
mers  were:  mouse β-actin,  (forward  5’-GACGATGCTCC 
CCGGGCTGTATTC-3’  and  reverse  5’-TCTCTTGCTCTG 
GGCCTCGTCACC-3’)  used  as  a  positive  control;  mouse

ward  5’-TGAATCGGACCCACTTGAGAGG-3’  and  reverse

1  (AQP1),  forward  5’-GGAGGCGCCGAGACTTAGGT-3’ 
and  reverse  5’-GCGGGTGAGCACAGCAGAGC-3’;  mouse 
transforming  growth  factor-β2  (TGF-β2),  forward  5’- 
TCATCCCGAATAAAAGCGAAGAGC-3’  and  reverse  5’- 
AGGGCAACAACATTAGCAGGAGAT-3’.  Real-time  RT-PCR 
was  performed  using  the  real-time  SensiMixPlus  SYBR 
kit  as  described  by  the  manufacturer’s  instructions 
(Quantance,  London,  UK).

Western  blot  analysis

Proteins  were  extracted  using  radio-immunoprecipitation 
assay  buffer  in  MEF  cells.  Proteins  were  separated  by 
12%  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate-polyacryamide  gel  electro-
phoresis  and  were  transferred  to  a  polyvinylidene  fluo-
ride  membrane  (Millipore,  Bellerica,  MA,  USA).  Mem-
branes  were  blocked  with  5%  non-fat  dry  milk  and  were 
incubated  with  various  antibodies.  Antibodies  to  PC2 
(anti-human  and  anti-mouse)  and  AQP1  were  obtained 
from  Santa  Cruz  Biotechnology  (Santa  Cruz,  CA,  USA). 
Antibodies  to β-actin  were  obtained  from  Sigma-Aldrich 
(St.  Louis,  MO,  USA).  Anti-Wnt4  was  obtained  from  R&D 
Systems  (Minneapolis,  MN,  USA).  Each  membrane  was 
washed  with  phosphate-buffered  saline-Tween,  and  im-
munocomplexes  were  detected  by  enhanced  chemilumi-
nescence  (Amersham). 

Results

Confirmation  of  PKD2 expression  in  Pkd2 KO 
and  PKD2  TG  MEFs

Mouse Pkd2 mRNA was revealed in KO wild-type (KOWT) 
MEF  cells  but  not  in  KO  MEF  cells.  Also,  Pkd2 mRNA 
was  expressed  in  TG  wild-type  (TGWT)  MEF  cells  and 
PKD2 TG  MEF  cells.  Human PKD2 mRNA  was  only  ex-
pressed  in PKD2 TG  MEF  cells  obtained  from PKD2 TG 
embryos  following  injection  of  the  human  PKD2 trans-
gene  (Fig.  1A).  Consistently,  the  expression  level  of  pol-
ycystin-2  was  lower  in  KO  MEFs  than  KOWT  MEFs  as 
well  as  higher  in  TG  MEFs  than  TGWT  MEFs  (Fig.  1B).

Microarray  gene  expression  analysis

We  used  a  mouse  30  K  whole  gene  oligonucleotide  mi-
croarray  to  identify  mRNAs  whose  expression  was  al-
tered  by  the  Pkd2 KO  and  PKD2 TG  MEF  cells.  The 
normalized  log  ratios  corresponding  to  each  time  point 
were  exported  to  the  software  for  clustering  algorithm. 
We  used  Axon’s  Acuity  3.1  (Axon  Instruments,  Union 
City,  CA,  USA)  for  using  the  ‘gene  shaving’  algorithm. 
To  estimate  the  number  of  clusters  in  a  dataset,  we 
used  ‘Gap  Statistics’  in  Acuity  3.1.  The  cluster  number 
estimated  by  gap  statistics  was  used  for  an  input  pa-
rameter  in  gene  shaving.  After  gene  shaving,  we  used  a 
single  linkage  hierarchical  clustering.  The  single  linkage 
hierarchical  clustering  method  divides  8  ‘gene  shaving’ 
clusters  (Fig.  2).  The  majority  of  genes  whose  ex-
pression  was  appreciably  altered  encoded  proteins  in-
volved  in  critical  biological  processes,  such  as  metabo-
lism,  transcription,  cell  adhesion,  cell  cycle,  and  signal 
transcription.  Forty-  five  genes  whose  expression  was 
changed  by  2-fold  or  greater  were  identified  (Table  1).

Verification  of  candidate  genes  by  quantitative 
RT-PCR  and  immunoblot  analysis

To  verify  the  results  obtained  by  cDNA  microarray  anal-
ysis,  expression  patterns  for  selected  genes  were  con-
firmed  at  the  RNA  and  protein  levels.  We  selected  seven 
genes  among  the  45  genes  (Fig.  3A).  As  result  of  real- 
time  RT-PCR,  the  expression  patterns  of PKCα, ITGα4, 
and AQP1 were  identical  to  microarray  analysis  in Pkd2 
KO  MEF  cells  (Fig.  3B).  In  contrast,  6  genes,  except  for 
TGF-β2,  were  identically  expressed  in  PKD2 TG  MEF 
cells  (Fig.  3C).  Especially,  the  AQP1 gene  may  be  sig-
nificantly  regulated  by  differential Pkd2 gene  expression 
level.  Furthermore,  to  confirm  the  AQP1  protein  expres-
sion  level,  western  blot  analysis  was  performed  using 
MEF  cells  as  well  as  kidney  tissues  obtained  from Pkd2 
KO  (or  heterozygote)  and  PKD2 TG  mice.  As  result, 
AQP1  protein  level  was  consistent  with  mRNA  levels  in 
both  MEFs  and  tissues  (Fig.  4). 

Discussion

Although  remarkable  progress  toward  understanding  the 
genetics  and  pathophysiology  of  ADPKD  has  been  made 
to  date,  it  is  still  unclear  how  mutations  in  disease-caus-
ing  genes  trigger  cystogenesis  and  what  important  role 
other  molecules  play  in  the  cystic  phenotype  [12].  Our 
aim  here  was  to  identify  genes  associated  with  the  cyst-
ic  phenotype  using Pkd2 KO  and PKD2 TG  MEF  cells. 
In  a  previous  study,  overexpression  of  human PKD2 led 
to  anomalies  in  tubular  function,  due  to  abnormalities  in 

tubule  morphogenesis  [13].  Similar  findings  have  been 
made  for  the  PKD1 gene.  For  this  gene,  gain/loss  of 
function  and  haploinsufficiency  leads  to  cystogenesis, 
with  the  severity  of  the  phenotype  being  related  to  the 
level  of  imbalance.  More  severe  phenotypes  are  seen 
for  gain  and  loss  of  function  than  for  haploinsufficiency 
[4].  In  the  present  study,  the  association  between  cysto-
genesis  and  the  loss  or  gain  of PKD2 supports  the  idea 
that  PC2  functions  through  Pkd2 mutant  MEF  cells. 
    Presently,  we  found  Wnt4  to  be  up-regulated  in Pkd2 
KO  MEF  cells  and  down-regulated  in  PKD2 TG  MEF 
cells.  Wnt4,  a  member  of  the  Wnt  family  of  lipid-modi-
fied  secreted  glycoproteins,  plays  central  roles  in  the  ini-
tial  stages  of  the  tubulogenic  program.  Wnt4  is  ex-
pressed  in  the  pretubular  aggregate,  as  one  of  the  first 
molecular  responses  to  inductive  signaling  mediated  by 
ureteric  epithelium  [14].
    AQP1  was  observed  to  be  up-regulated  in  both Pkd2 
KO  and PKD2 TG  MEF  cells.  AQP1  is  a  channel-forming 
integral  membrane  protein  found  in  erythrocytes  and 
water-transporting  tissues,  including  the  kidney,  where  it 
is  localized  to  the  proximal  tubules  and  thin  descending 
limbs  of  Henle’s  loop.  The  selective  expression  pattern 
of  AQP1  in  human  nephrogenesis  suggests  that  prox-
imal  tubules  and  thin  descending  limbs  become  per-
meable  to  water  early  in  development.  A  predominantly 
apical  expression  of  AQP1  is  found  during  a  critical  pe-
riod  of  the  nephrogenesis,  during  formation  of  the  prox-
imal  tubule,  as  well  as  in  the  early  stage  of  ADPKD;  in 
normal  tubules,  distribution  is  both  apical  and  baso-
lateral  [15].  Another  interesting  defect  in  urine-concen-

20 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  10(1)  16-22,  March  2012

trating ability was described in the Aqp1 knockout mouse. 
Although  these  mice  were  grossly  normal  in  terms  of 
survival  and  appearance,  they  were  vulnerable  to  water 
deprivation  and  became  severely  dehydrated.  These  re-
sults  suggest  that  AQP1  is  required  for  the  formation  of 
concentrated  urine  [16].
    We  have  found  PKC-α  and  Bcl-2  associated  transcrip-
tion  factor  to  be  down-regulated  in Pkd2 KO  MEF  cells 
and  up-regulated  in PKD2 TG  MEF  cells.  Recent  obser-
vations  in  animal  models  of  PKD  have  implicated  apop-
tosis  in  its  pathogenesis.  PKC-  and  Erk-dependent  path-
ways  are  critical  components  of  the  cell  survival  by  sup-

pressing  the  apoptosis  [17].  We  also  have  demonstrated 
the  role  for PKD2 in  cellular  adhesion  processes.  In  this 
study,  ITGα4  was  up-regulated  in  Pkd2 KO  MEF  cells 
and  down-regulated  in PKD2 TG  MEF  cells.  It  suggests 
that  adhesion  molecule  such  as  ITGα4  may  be  asso-
ciated  with  PKD2 mutation-related  pathogenesis.
    In  conclusion,  by  using  the  cDNA  microarray  techni-
que,  we  have  found  several  candidate  genes  that  may 
be  involved  in  cystogenesis:  PKCα,  ITGα4  and  AQP1. 
These  genes  were  affected  by  PKD2 expression  and 
may  be  related  to  cyst  formation  of  kidney  together  with 
the  PKD2 gene.
