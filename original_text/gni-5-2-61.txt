Abstract
The  allele  frequencies  of  markers  as  well  as  linkage 
disequilibrium (LD) can be changed in cases due to the LD 
between  markers  and  the  disease  allele,  exhibiting 
spurious  associations  of  markers.  To  identify  the  true 
association,  classical  statistical  tests  for  dealing  with 
confounders have been applied to draw a conclusion as 
to whether the association of variants comes from LD with 
the known disease allele. However, a more direct test 
considering LD using estimated haplotype frequencies 
may be more efficient. The null hypothesis is that the 
different allele frequencies of a variant between cases and 
controls come solely from the increased disease allele 
frequency and the LD relationship with the disease allele. 
The haplotype frequencies of controls are estimated using 
the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm from the 
genotype data. The estimated frequencies are applied to 
calculate the expected haplotype frequencies in cases 
corresponding to the increase or decrease of the causative 
or protective alleles. The suggested method was applied 
to previously published data, and several APOE variants 
showed association with Alzheimer’s disease independent 
from the APOE ε4 variant, rs429358, regardless of LD 
showing significant simulated p-values. The test results 
support the possibility that there may be more than one 
common disease variant in a locus.

approaches  to  the  genetic  studies  of  complex  traits. 
Following the successes of the HapMap project (Altshuler 
et al., 2005), the recent focus in this field has been to find 
common low-penetrance variants which increase risk in 
population. This is achieved by using the linkage disequilibrium 
with the disease variant in case-control association studies. 
The advantage of linkage disequilibrium mapping using 
case-controls  is  better  detection  of  common  disease 
alleles in a population, rather than family specific disease 
alleles. With high linkage disequilibrium, the polymorphisms 
that are closely linked together in a population form regions 
that are termed linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks. Within 
a LD block, several marker alleles in linkage disequilibrium 
with the risk allele are sufficient to identify the association 
of a complex trait with the disease polymorphisms in the 
region (Weiss and Clark, 2002). The usual measurement 
of LD is D’ and r2, and is generally considered as significant 
if D’ is higher than .7 and r2 is higher than .3 (Ardlie et al., 
2002; Weiss and Clark, 2002). The former indicates scaled 
linkage disequilibrium, and the latter provides information 
about the correlation between two alleles.

Many  genetic  association  studies  of  complex  traits 
utilize a set of several haplotype-tag SNPs for testing the 
association of LD-block haplotypes with diseases. Generally, 
more sensitive detection in the association tests using 
haplotypes is expected due to the higher possibility of 
capturing  the  disease  allele  within  haplotypes  with 
well-defined tags rather than a single marker (Chapman 
et al., 2003; de Bakker et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2001). 
It should be noted that the detection of association purely 
depends on the linkage disequilibrium state of the disease 
allele with the haplotypes, and the effective size of the 
disease allele (Chapman et al., 2003; De La Vega et al., 
2005). There are many helpful studies regarding LD which 
rely on tagging methods and powerful calculations (de 
Bakker et al., 2005; Gordon et al., 2002). However, it should 
be noted that, due to the influence of Mendelian genetics, 
it tends to be underestimated that there can be several 
common disease variants in a gene region. In the case of 
common biallelic variants, if one allele is risky, the other 
has a protective effect. The existence of such common 
disease  variants  can  cause  a  severe  decrease  in  the 
detection power from the combination of disease alleles, 
since an individual will have a set of relevant disease 
alleles. Using the current association method, it is hard to 
distinguish which variants are the real causes of disease

among the variants in high LD especially using r2 if the 
disease variant does not prove to be functional. Large 
sample sizes and replications can help with the interpretation 
of results, but the intrinsic problems still remain in situations 
where there are several disease variants in a LD block.
Statistically,  these  problems  can  be  considered  as 
confounding factors and effect modifiers, and can be dealt 
with using conventional statistical methods. Confounding 
factors  create  confusion  in  data  sets,  so  need  to  be 
removed by controlling the factors responsible, but the 
effect modifier creates a modifying effect on the outcome 
due to the effects of itself on the main variable. There are 
several classical methods for dealing with these kinds of 
problems;  randomization,  stratification  (specification), 
matching, multivariate regression, and propensity score. 
In the case of linkage disequilibrium, the problem is quite 
different from those, since the relationship between the 
confounding factors and the real associated factors are 
known. Unlike the usual statistical problems, the analytical 
method  can  be  easily  derived  from  the  nature  of  the 
relationship,  and  will  not  reduce  the  detection  power, 
underestimate or overestimate the interpretation. To test 
the  independence  of  association  from  linked  disease 
variants, a more direct way of controlling linkage disequilibrium 
is suggested.

Methods
Linkage Disequilibrium Properties: Changes due 
to a disease allele
Linkage disequilibrium is important in finding common 
disease variants from population data, but it can be a 
problem eliminating the confounding associations while 
finding the real disease variants. In this study, the basic 
behaviors of changes in LD and allele frequencies between 
cases  and  controls  were  studied  depending  on  the 
existence of a disease variant in a locus. The assumption 
is that cases and controls are collected from the same 
population, and the LD in the controls represents the LD 
in the general population, which is often the case. For very 
common diseases (or traits), a correction of LD in controls 
considering the whole population may be necessary. Using 
the assumption, the changes in marker frequencies and 
LD are observed naturally during the sampling procedure 
of cases. Due to the LD between markers and the disease 
variant, the changes in allele frequencies as well as LD can 
be observed even when the r2 or D’ are not very high.

Here is an example of two markers, A and B, with minor 
alleles indicated in lower case and major alleles in upper 
case. Frequencies of all four possible haplotypes, AB, aB, 
Ab, and ab, can be expressed by one of the haplotype

allele frequencies of A and B are 0.3 and 0.2, respectively.

frequencies when the allele frequencies are fixed. The 
possible haplotype frequencies of AB are limited depending 
on their minor allele frequencies as shown in equation (1). 
The change in LD due to frequencies of haplotype AB is 
plotted in Fig. 1, where the minor allele frequencies of A and 
B are 0.2 and 0.3, respectively. The lowest LD is obtained 
when p(AB) is equal to p(A)p(B), in this case 0.8 × 0.7 = 0.56

with an increment of 0.15 for minor disease alleles. The 
expected haplotype frequencies depend on the haplotype 
frequencies in controls, the proportion of the haplotype 
among the total haplotypes containing the same disease 
allele  in  controls  (i.e.  the  disease  allele  frequency  in 
controls), and the increment or decrement of disease allele 
frequencies  in  the  cases.  For  ‘pd’,  the  minor  allele 
frequency of the disease variant, ‘RR’, the relative risk of 
the disease allele, and ‘OR’, the odds ratio of the disease 
allele, the haplotype frequency in cases containing the 
disease allele can be derived using equation (2).

ratio (c is the disease allele).

depending on the odds ratio of the disease allele c (thin line: LD
between A and B, regular line: LD between B and C, thick line:
LD between A and C).

For a disease variant, C, with the odds ratio of 3 and the 
minor allele frequency of 0.1, the changes of haplotype 
frequencies and LD are calculated in Table 1 and 2, where 
p(AB) is 0.62, as indicated by a vertical dashed line in Fig. 
1. The rest of the haplotype frequencies in the controls for 
all three variants are anonymously assigned in Table 1. In 
this example, the disease allele frequency in cases is 0.25 

As a result, the frequencies and LD are changed in Table 
1 and 2, even with low LD between markers and the disease 
variant in controls. To examine the changes depending on 
the odds ratio of the disease allele, minor allele frequencies 
and LD are plotted in Fig. 2 and 3. Using the initial haplotype 
state set out in Table1, the minor allele of marker A is 
increased and the minor allele of marker B is marginally 
decreased  as  the  odds  ratio  increases.  Since  the  LD 
coefficient, r2, indicates the correlation among variants, 
there is a natural decrease of LD between markers and an 
increase of LD between the marker and the disease allele, 
as shown in Fig. 3. The behavior of D’ is different from the 
behavior of r2. As the odds ratio is increased, the D’ between 
markers decreases in a similar manner to r2. However, as 
shown in Fig. 2 and 3, the D’ between a marker and the 
disease variant becomes minimal at the point where the 
increment of the minor allele of the disease variant exceeds 
the marker’s minor allele frequency, after which it increases.
When  examining  the  complete  range  of  haplotype 
frequencies (indicated in equation 1), the r2 between a 
marker  and  the  disease  variant  is  increased  in  every 
haplotype frequency of AB as the odds ratio increases. 
However, the D’ becomes minimal until the increment of 
the minor allele of the disease variant exceeds the marker’s 
minor allele in a given case, and thereafter increases, when 
the  AB  haplotype  frequencies  are  higher  than  the 
multiplication between the marker major allele frequency 
and the disease major allele frequency. Otherwise, D’ is 
decreased depending on the increment of odds ratios. 
Using the linkage disequilibrium changes between cases 
and  controls,  it  is  possible  to  elucidate  whether  the 
observed variants are real disease variants or just markers 
of which frequencies are changed solely due to real disease 
variants.

Testing Hypothesis
In many association studies, there are several variants in 
a locus that show associations, possibly through LD, with 
the disease variants. If the functional variants are not 
obvious, it is difficult to distinguish the true association from 
the linked markers. Here, a way of testing the independence 
in association from the known hypothetical disease variants 
is proposed, using the LD properties described earlier. The 
null hypothesis is that the increased or decreased marker 
allele frequencies arise solely from the LD relationship with 
the increased disease allele. The haplotype frequencies of 
the testing marker and disease variant(s) are estimated 
using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm from the 
control  genotype  data,  and  applied  to  calculate  the 
expected haplotype frequencies, considering LD with the 
increased allele frequency of the disease variant. This is 
related  to  the  increment  or  decrement  of  haplotypes 
corresponding to the proportion of the haplotype frequency 
harbored in the risky (or protective) disease allele. In cases 
with more than one disease variant, the disease variant can 
be replaced by the disease haplotypes consisting of the 
disease variants, which can be considered as a multi-allelic 
disease variant. From known disease haplotypes, D (d1
,…,n), consisting of disease variants with known estimated 
relative risks of haplotypes and known LD status between 
disease  variants  and  the  marker,  the  expected  allele 
frequency of the testing variant is expressed as equation (3). 
Using the expected frequencies, it is possible to test the 
independence  of  association  of  the  variant  from  the 
assumed disease variant.

Statistical Method
To test if the association of markers is independent from 
the known disease variants, the expected allele frequency 
in cases from equation (3) can be compared with the real 
allele frequency in the respective case. For estimating the 
control  haplotype  frequencies,  the  EM  algorithm  was 
applied.  As  indicated  in  the  previous  section,  the  null 
hypothesis is that the changed allele frequencies of the 
marker are solely due to the LD with the disease variant(s), 
which is estimated using equation (3), and the alternative 
is the distribution of real cases. The Pearson chi-square 
test was performed with the Monte Carlo method for the 
computation of simulated p-value using R 2.2.1. 

Sample Descriptions
Using  previously  published  data  (Farrer  et  al.,  1997; 

Kamboh et al., 1999; Nicodemus et al., 2004), the in-
dependence in association of all seven variants studied 
was tested for counting the LD with rs429358, which enc-
odes ε4. In the case of the ε2 allele, coded by rs7412, high 
D’ with the ε4 allele, rs429358, causes the haplotype fre-
quency containing the minor allele of rs7412 to naturally 
decrease  due  to  the  increment  of  the  minor  allele  of 
rs429358. In the meta-analysis study data (Farrer et al., 
1997), the minor allele of rs7412 shows a minor protective 
effect. To verify that the decrement of the minor allele of 
rs7412 is due to the LD with rs429358, pooled Caucasian 
samples (Farrer et al., 1997) were used. For rs769452, the 
only study reported (Kamboh et al., 1999) was tested. For 
the remaining variants, data from Nicodemus et al. (2004) 
were applied to the test. The odds ratio of ε4 used in this 
test is 3.65218, calculated from the Caucasian data in the 
previous study, and used for the tests, since this provided 
the largest sample among the selected publications (Farrer 
et al., 1997). 

Results
The described method of controlling LD in association tests 
was applied to the actual association results of APOE 
variants with Alzheimer’s disease. Considering inconsistent 
associations in complex traits, it is noteworthy that ApoE ε4 
association in Alzheimer’s disease has been replicated in 
most studies, especially in Caucasians, indicating that a 
reasonably large effect would not be overlooked in an 
association study. Although this disease allele in APOE 
merely  contributes  to  the  partial  genetic  etiology  of 
Alzheimer’s disease, the odds ratio of homozygotes is 14.9 
as  derived  by  meta-analysis,  and  the  allelic  effect  is 
approximately multiplicative (Farrer et al., 1997). However, 
there  are  other  functional  variants  in  APOE  that  may 
contribute  to  Alzheimer’s  disease  such  as  other  non- 
synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
transcriptional variants. Previously, the genetic effects of 
potential transcriptional variants were tested taking into 
consideration the linkage disequilibrium  with  rs429358 
coding ε4 using regression with adjustment and stratification 
depending on their genotypes. However, only rs1081106 
(+5361) showed marginal significance among the five 
SNPs  tested  (Nicodemus  et  al.,  2004).  As  indicated 
previously, with the known relationship between the testing 
markers  and  the  disease  variant,  the  conventional 
statistical tests used in this study may represent less valid 
results for counting the LD appropriately. Therefore, the 
genetic effect of the studied APOE variants was re-evaluated 
using the method for counting the LD suggested here.

Regarding the variants in APOE, a total of eight variants

near the gene have been studied for their associations with 
Alzheimer’s disease, but the results were inconsistent in 
many cases except in the case of ε4. In this gene region, 
there are many rare non-synonymous variants with minor 
allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01, which are associated with 
certain diseases, and three, ε2, 3, and 4, are known to be 
common  protein  variants  (de  Knijff  et  al.,  1994).  The 
common protein variants are defined by two sequence 
variants,  rs429358  (coding  ε4  T/C  C130R  carrier%= 
6.4~36.8) and rs7412 (coding ε2, C/T R176C carrier%= 
0~14.5),  which  are  known  to  be  associated  with 
Alzheimer’s disease. The haplotype TC defines ε3, CC 
defines ε4, and TT defines ε2. Among the rare variants, one 
variant, Leu28Pro (ε4*P), which is always observed with 
Cys130Arg coded by rs429358, has been shown to be 
associated with AD (heterozygosity in controls = .18%; 
heterozygosity in cases=2.42%) (Kamboh et al., 1999).

As indicated in Table 3, several variants have been 
shown  to  be  associated  with  Alzheimer’s  disease 
independent from the APOE ε4 variant, rs429358, regardless 
of LD, and showing significant simulated p-values. These 
tests show that the associations of rs449647, rs440446, 
rs769452,  and  rs7412  are  independent  from  rs429358. 
However, the results merely represent the independence 
in association from rs429358, and do not confirm the actual 
association of each variant. Therefore, in order to find the 
real effect of each variant, further studies are necessary. 
Due to the unavailability of data, testing for multiple putative 
disease  variants,  particularly  using  non-synonymous 
variants, could not be tested further.

Discussion
Using  the  basic  property  of  the  change  in  linkage 

disequilibrium between cases and controls depending on 
the real disease variant, we have proposed a new test for 
the independence of association for counting LD. The 
independence in association from several disease haplotypes 
can be tested for the existence of several disease variants 
using equation (3). However, it should be noted that this 
test does not provide a concrete result for the number of 
disease variants or their actual odds ratio. As seen in the 
APOE association result, if there are several common 
disease variants in a locus, the consideration of number 
of disease variants as well as their LD relationship is critical 
in detecting associations. By adding the probable disease 
variants until finding the best fitting model, the model with 
real  disease  variants  can  be  found  with  the  highest 
likelihood. The actual association of those disease variants 
may be confirmed by likelihood ratio tests using haplotypes 
consisting  of  the  disease  variants.  Further  study  on 
relevant issues would be necessary.

From the test example, several APOE variants turned 
out to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease independent 
from the association of the APOE ε4 variant, rs429358. For 
obtaining the allelic odds ratio of rs429358 and testing 
rs7412, the pooled Caucasian samples in each study may 
cause  inaccuracy  in  the  results  possibly  due  to  the 
heterogeneity. However, the results counting heterogeneity 
are not expected to be critically different from the results 
in here. These tests indicate the existence of more disease 
variants than rs429358 in APOE, which has been doubtful 
for associations with Alzheimer’s disease due to their LD 
with APOE rs429358. Analyses with full genotype data 
would give a better idea regarding the real disease variants. 
However,  it  could  not  be  concluded  without  further 
replications of these results and confirmation by functional 
evidence.

Regarding  the  transcriptional  activity  of  the  APOE 
variants, among the five putative regulatory SNPs near 
APOE  studied  for  their  association  with  Alzheimer’s 
disease, the -491 variant, rs449647, has been studied most 
extensively. Transcriptional activity of this variant was 
verified for haplotypes with another SNP, rs769446, using 
luciferase-based transient cell transfection of astrocytoma 
cells (Artiga et al., 1998; Bullido et al., 1998). Allele A of 
rs449647  increases  the  transcriptional  activity  in  vitro 
(Artiga et al., 1998; Bullido et al., 1998) and leads to an 
increase in brain ApoE level in humans (Laws et al., 2002), 
which is consistent with the hypothesis that an increased 
ApoE level increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The 
combined analysis using both rs449647 and rs769446 
results in significantly altered promoter activity among the 
haplotypes, TT, AT, and AC. The AC haplotype, consisting 
of the A allele of rs449647 and the C allele of rs769446, 
shows the highest promoter activity, and the TT haplotype 
shows the least promoter activity. In the meta-analysis of 
Alzforum (http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/gen/alzgene/ 
meta.asp?geneID=85),  the  minor  alleles,  T  allele  of 
rs449647  and  C  allele  of  rs769446  are  the  protective 
alleles. The protective effect of the C allele of rs769446 is 
opposite  from  expectations  considering  the  increased 
transcriptional  activity,  possibly  due  to  the  LD  with 
rs429358. The risk associated with the AC haplotype is the 
highest compared to the other two haplotypes among 
non-ApoE ε4 subpopulation, supporting the notion that the 
transcriptional effect of rs769446 may still be a weak causal 
factor. Moreover, a recent study on regulatory elements of 
the APOE promoter showed clear cell specificity of these 
elements, in which rs405509 showed differential transcriptional 
activity depending on the associated allele and cell type 
(Ramos  et  al.,  2005).  Although  the  functionality  of 
rs449647 matches the causality even with the result of 
significant association after the LD correction, sometimes, 
the functional evidence may not correlate with the diseases 
as seen in the negative associations of both rs769446 and 
rs405509 in Table3. Otherwise, their weak causal effect 
may be hidden in this test due to the LD with disease variants 
other than rs429358.

As stated previously, among the equivocal association 
studies, APOE ε4 association is noteworthy for its robust 
replications especially in Caucasians. This robustness 
may come from rs429358 as well as other disease variants 
in this gene, and/or from the unusual LD pattern due to the 
selection pressure on rs429358, which can be supported 
by the sequence comparison with chimpanzees and the 
slightly  increased  LD  among  common  variants  near 
rs429358 from the LD pattern using the re-sequenced data

(Nickerson et al., 2000). In either case, the association 

studies  need  to  be  conducted  more  carefully  with 
consideration to the LD properties described in this study. 
This  study  provides  the  possible  basis  for  a  better 
interpretation  of  haplotype  associations  in  a  region. 
Moreover,  the  LD  property  studied  here  may  assist 
improved  tagging  and  power  calculation  in  relation  to 
several  common  disease  variants  by  providing  the 
associated relationship between the disease variants and 
markers in association tests. Depending on the described 
LD property, the association can be detected even with the 
low LD if the markers are close enough. This knowledge 
could be applied to design an efficient study for finding new 
disease variants. The LD property described here could 
also be used together with the publicly available LD data 
for the elucidation of further disease variants.
