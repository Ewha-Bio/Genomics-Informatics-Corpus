Neuropeptides produced from prohormones by selective action of endopeptidases are vital signaling molecules, playing a 
critical role in a variety of physiological processes, such as addiction, depression, pain, and circadian rhythms. Neuropeptides 
bind to post-synaptic receptors and elicit cellular effects like classical neurotransmitters. While each neuropeptide could have 
its own biological function, mass spectrometry (MS) allows for the identification of the precise molecular forms of each 
peptide without a priori knowledge of the peptide identity and for the quantitation of neuropeptides in different conditions 
of the samples. MS-based neuropeptidomics approaches have been applied to various animal models and conditions to 
characterize and quantify novel neuropeptides, as well as known neuropeptides, advancing our understanding of nervous 
system function over the past decade. Here, we will present an overview of neuropeptides and MS-based neuropeptidomic 
strategies for the identification and quantitation of neuropeptides.

Introduction

Neuropeptide Synthesis

Neuropeptides, which signal between neurons, are known 
to  be  involved  in  a  variety  of  physiological  processes, 
including addiction, depression, hunger, pain, fear, anxiety, 
and  circadian  rhythms  [1,  2].  Neuropeptides  are  3–100 
amino acid residues  long and up  to  50 times larger than 
classic  neurotransmitters  [3].  The  term  “neuropeptides” 
was first introduced by De Wied [4] in 1971 to describe an 
endogenous  peptide  synthesized  in  nerve  cells.  While 
peptide hormones are also considered important intercell-
ular  signaling  molecules,  there  are  differences  between 
neuropeptides and peptide hormones. That is, neuropeptides 
are secreted from neuronal cells (primarily neurons but also 
glia  for  some  peptides)  and  signal  to  neighboring  cells 
(primarily neurons), whereas peptide hormones are secreted 
from  neuroendocrine  cells  and  act  on  distant  tissues  by 
traveling  through  the  blood  [2,  5].  Approximately  100 
different neuropeptides are currently known to function in 
cell-to-cell signaling (http://www.neuropeptides.nl). Neur-
opeptides bind to post-synaptic receptors and elicit cellular 
responses like classical neurotransmitters.

Neuropeptides are produced from precursor proteins (or 
prohormones) by a series of enzymatic processing steps. The 
neuropeptide precursors generally do not have functions on 
their own, requiring processing to generate the active forms. 
The precursors are synthesized on ribosomes at the endo-
plasmic  reticulum  and  processed  through  the  Golgi  [5]. 
When the NH2-terminal signal peptide of the neuropeptide 
precursors is cleaved by signal peptidase, the precursors are 
routed to the Golgi apparatus and packaged into dense-core 
secretory  vesicles  together  with  processing  proteases, 
termed convertases. Most neuropeptide precursors are first 
processed  by  endopeptidases, 
including  prohormone 
convertase 1 (also known as prohormone convertase 3) and 
prohormone convertase 2 and, to a lesser extent, prohormone/ 
proprotein  convertase  5A  (also  known  as  prohormone/ 
proprotein convertase 6A) [6]. The endopeptidases typically 
cleave at pairs of basic amino acids, usually Lys-Arg (KR) or 
Arg-Arg (RR) sites, but on occasion, the basic amino acids 
are separated by 2, 4, or 6 other amino acids (Fig. 1). The 
next stage of processing is the removal of C-terminal basic 
residues in the mature secretory vesicle. Carboxypeptidase E

precursor  protein  occurs  in  a  tissue-specific  and  even 
region-specific manner. A classic example is the processing 
of the precursor proopiomelanocortin in the pituitary. In the 
anterior lobe of the pituitary, the precursor is converted into 
adrenocorticotropic  hormone  (ACTH),  which  binds  to 
several subtypes of melanocortin receptors, such as MC2R, 
located  in  the  adrenal  gland;  this  receptor  controls  the 
production of glucocorticoids (cortisol) [9, 10]. In the inter-
mediate lobe of the pituitary and also in the brain, ACTH is 
further processed into alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, 
which  binds  to  melanocortin  receptors  with  completely 
different  affinities  [11].  The  PTMs  can  also  regulate  the 
bioactivity and stability of the neuropeptides and therefore 
affect  the  binding  affinities  of  the  neuropeptides  for  the 
receptors. For example, acetylation of the N-terminus of β
-endorphin removes the ability of the peptide to stimulate 
opioid receptors and to produce analgesia [6]. Conversely, 
octanoylation of the peptide ghrelin on a serine residue is 
essential for the binding of the peptide to its receptor [12]. 
Although the various aspects of peptide synthesis, including 
PTMs,  lead  to  an  increase  in  neuropeptide  complexity, 
unveiling new peptides and unreported peptide properties is 
critical to advancing our understanding of nervous system 
function. 

Clinical Importance of Neuropeptides

While  neuropeptides  are  involved  in  a  wide  range  of 
physiological processes, including hunger, food intake, body 
weight regulation, and circadian rhythms, it has been shown 
that dysregulation of neuropeptides often results in a variety 
of  neurological  disorders  [13-15].  Epilepsy  is  a  common 
neurological  disorder  characterized  by  recurrent  seizures. 
Neuropeptides, such as arginine-vasopressin, corticotropin- 
releasing factor (CRF), enkephalin, β-endorphin, pituitary 
adenylate  cyclase-activating  polypeptide  (PACAP),  and 
tachykinins,  were  shown  to  have  proconvulsive  effects, 
whereas  other  neuropeptides,  like  ACTH,  angiotensin, 
cholecystokinin,  somatostatin,  and  thyrotropin-releasing 
hormone, were able to suppress seizures in the brain [16]. In 
addition, neuropeptides, such as dynorphin and substance P, 
were  shown  to  be  involved  in  the  pathophysiology  of 
Parkinson’s disease, which is a neurodegenerative disease 
with motor and non-motor symptoms [17]. Progression to 
addiction is also known to be influenced by several pepti-
dergic neuromodulators.  A few  orexigenic neuropeptides, 
including galanin, enkephalin, and orexin/hypocretin, were 
shown to have a positive feedback relationship to alcohol, 
while  other  hypothalamic  neuropeptides,  such  as  dynor-
phin, CRF, and melanocortins, showed a negative feedback 
relationship  to  alcohol  intake.  Dysregulation  of  these

and Sons [6]. A hypothetical precursor  is  shown  to  contain  typical 
processing sites of Lys-Arg (KR), Arg-Arg (RR), or R-Xn-R, where n 
= 2, 4, or 6. First, a signal peptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum
removes the N-terminal signal peptide, and the precursor is routed
to  the  Golgi  apparatus  and  packaged  into  dense-core  secretory 
vesicles.  The  prohormone  convertase  1,  2,  or  5A  cleaves  the 
precursor to produce intermediates that contain C-terminal K and/or
R residues. Those basic residues are removed by carboxypeptidase
E  (or  D).  After  removal  of  the  basic  residues,  peptides  with  a 
C-terminal  glycine  are  typically  converted  to  the  amide  by 
peptidyl-glycine  α-amidating monooxygenase. In addition, a number 
of  other  post-translational  modifications 
including 
N-terminal  acetylation,  phosphorylation,  and  pyroglutamylation, 
have  been  reported.

(PTMs), 

is the exopeptidase primarily responsible for removing the 
C-terminal basic residues, and carboxypeptidase D has also 
been  shown  to  act  in  this  role.  After  removal  of  the 
C-terminal basic residues, other enzymes perform additional 
post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as amidation, 
acetylation,  phosphorylation,  sulfation,  and  glycosylation 
[6].  For  example,  peptides  with  a  C-terminal  glycine  are 
typically converted to the amide by peptidyl-α-amidating 
monooxygnenase [7], and tyrosine sulfation is known to be 
mediated by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase [8]. These final 
bioactive forms of the peptides are stored within secretory 
vesicles  that are  accumulated  within  the  cells.  When  the 
cells are stimulated, the secretory vesicles are known to fuse 
with  the  cellular  membrane  to  release  the  neuropeptides 
into  the  extracellular  environment  [2].  The  secreted 
neuropeptides can interact with receptors containing specific 
binding  sites.  The  receptors  are  often  G-protein-coupled 
receptors.  The  interaction  of  the  neuropeptides  with  the 
receptors causes a conformational change in the receptor, 
resulting in the production of a cellular response through a 
variety of mechanisms, depending on the type of receptor.

While  a  single  neuropeptide  precursor  often  produces 
multiple  neuropeptides,  the  proteolytic  processing  of  the

multiple  neuropeptides  is  assumed  to  result  in  alcohol 
addiction [18]. There was also a report that neuropeptides, 
such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptides, vasoa-
ctive intestinal peptide/PACAP, and neuropeptide Y (NPY), 
are  associated  with  regulation  of  cutaneous  immune 
responses and tissue maintenance and repair. Due to these 
diverse  functions  of  neuropeptides,  neuropeptides  and 
neuropeptide  receptors  have  been  drug  targets  for  the 
treatment of neurological disorders [3, 19].

Mass Spectrometry-Based Neuropeptidomics
Traditional methods of neuropeptide analysis

Traditionally, the analysis of neuropeptides was perfor-
med by Edman sequencing, in which the N-terminal amino 
acid is sequentially removed. The method was developed by 
Edman in 1950 and is used for neuropeptide sequencing in 
many  different  species—for  example,  NPY  in  the  porcine 
brain  [20]  and  gonadotropin-releasing  hormone  in  the 
dogfish brain [21]. However, analysis by this method is slow 
and  does  not  allow  for  the  sequencing  of  neuropeptides 
containing N-terminal PTMs [22]. Immunological techni-
ques,  such  as  radioimmunoassay  (RIA)  and  immunohi-
stochemistry (IHC), have been used for measuring relative 
neuropeptide levels and spatial localization. RIA has been a 
popular tool to quantify neuropeptides in biological samples, 
such as NPY [23] and galanin in the rat brain [24]. Although 
RIA is a relatively sensitive technique capable of absolute 
quantification of peptide levels, it is not always specific for a 
single-peptide form because of its antibody-based detection 
method. In addition, unless specific antibodies are available 

for the different isoforms, RIAs do not distinguish between 
these modifications. IHC has provided essential information 
regarding  the  localization  of  neuropeptides  within  the 
complexity  of  the  brain  structure,  improving  our  under-
standing of the distribution of peptides. However, IHC does 
not  report  the  actual  size  or  full  identity  of  the  peptide, 
including PTMs. In addition, these antibody-based methods 
require  a  priori  knowledge  of  a  potential  neuropeptide  in 
order to generate antibodies specific to the neuropeptides 
and only detect peptide sequences with known structures. 

Mass Spectrometry-Based Peptidomics

In contrast to immuno-based methods, mass spectrometry 
(MS) enables one to detect and identify the precise forms of 
neuropeptides without a priori knowledge of the peptide’s 
identity,  resulting  in  the  identification  of  previously 
unknown neuropeptides. MS has been used to identify and 
characterize  hundreds  of  endogenous  peptides  in  various 
animals [25-29]. The high-throughput discovery of neuro-
peptides based on MS has made up the field of peptidomics 
(Fig. 2) [6, 30-33]. While typical proteomic analysis involves 
the digestion of proteins using proteases, such as trypsin, to 
generate peptides that can be readily sequenced by tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS), peptidomics focuses on the 
analysis  of  the  native  peptide  forms,  including  PTMs, 
without using digestive enzymes. Therefore, it is important 
to  identify  and  characterize  as  many  neuropeptides  as 
possible, because each peptide can have its own biological 
function.  While  MS-based peptidomics can  be  utilized to 
characterize a large number of neuropeptides simultaneously, 
it  can  be  also  applied  to  the  quantification  of  individual

according to Creative Commons License [33]. Peptidomics focuses on analyzing endogenous peptides that are present in biological samples,
including brain tissue. In contrast to bottom-up proteomics studies that involve proteolytic digestion, it is important to minimize the activity
of proteases that may be present in the samples via heat or microwave irradiation prior to peptide extraction in the peptidomics experiments. 
While the extracted peptides can be analyzed directly by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MS, they are often separated 
by  reversed-phase  chromatography  or  capillary  electrophoresis  in  order  to  reduce  sample  complexity.  Then,  the  peptides  are  analyzed 
by  MS  in  order  to  obtain  amino  acid  sequence  information  of  the  peptides  without  a priori  knowledge.  RP-HPLC,  reverse  phase-high

Sample Preparation for Peptidomics Experiment

Although MS allows the identification of a large number 
of  neuropeptides  in  a  high-throughput  manner,  sample 
preparation prior to MS is a critical step that affects peptide 
identification coverage in peptidomics experiments. When 
the animal is sacrificed and the brain tissue of interest is 
obtained,  proteases  rapidly  degrade  larger  proteins  into 
smaller  peptides  that  fall  into  the  mass  range  of  neuro-
peptides. The presence of degraded products derived from 
highly abundant proteins often complicates the MS analysis 
and  interferes  with  the  identification  of  less  abundant 
neuropeptides.  Different  techniques,  including  focused 
microwave  irradiation  before  decapitation,  microwave 
irradiation  after  decapitation,  and  boiling  the  tissue 
immediately after decapitation, have been used in order to 
inactivate the proteases responsible for the high background 
of protein degradation fragments [32, 34-38]. In addition to 
the procedures of protease deactivation, peptide extraction 
and  subsequent  treatment  are  other  steps  that  affect  the 
number  of  identified  neuropeptides.  The  use  of  different 
solvents  and  procedures  can  affect  the  peptide  profiles 
detectable in brain tissue. Che et al. [31] compared different 
extraction conditions for the recovery of neuropeptides from 
mouse  hypothalamus.  They  found  that  sonication  and 
heating in water (70oC for 20 min), followed by cold acid and 
centrifugation,  enabled  the  efficient  extraction  of  many 
neuropeptides without the formation of the protein degra-
dation fragments seen with hot acid extractions. Bora et al. 
[39] and Lee et al. [37] also showed that multiple stages of 
peptide extraction, including boiling water, acidified acetone, 
and  acetic  acid,  were  able  to  maximize  the  number  of 
identified neuropeptides from their respective analyses of 
supraoptic  nucleus  and  suprachiasmatic  nucleus  (SCN) 
samples in the rat brain.

MS Analysis

After  sample  processing,  the  extracted  peptides  are 
subjected to MS analysis. A mass spectrometer consists of an 
ionization source, a mass analyzer separating the ions based 
on their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and a detector recor-
ding the number of ions at each m/z value. Two commonly 
used types of ionization are electrospray ionization (ESI) and 
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). While 
each  approach  has  its  own  advantages,  MALDI  is  more 
tolerant  to  the  presence  of  salts.  Thus,  MALDI  is  often 
applied to direct tissue profiling or molecular ion imaging 
from  tissue  sections.  Direct  tissue  sample  analysis  by 
MALDI-based MS is usually performed by a simple sequence 
of steps, which include placing the tissue of interest on the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  1,  2016

MALDI plate, applying a droplet of matrix, and irradiating 
the co-crystallized tissue to cause desorption/ionization of 
the  peptides  [30].  MALDI  imaging  provides  valuable 
information pertaining to the spatial localization of neuro-
peptides [40]. Although MALDI-MS can be interfaced with 
separation strategies, such as liquid chromatography (LC) 
and capillary electrophoresis, ESI-MS can be coupled more 
easily  with the separation  methods,  because  the  ions  are 
produced as an aerosol from the liquid phase with a high 
voltage  in  ESI.  The  introduction  of  a  nano-electrospray, 
based on capillary LC, coupled to MS, significantly increases 
the sensitivity in LC-ESI-MS, and furthermore, the preferred 
formation of multiple-charge states in ESI allows for more 
comprehensive MS/MS fragmentation data. 

MS Data Analysis for Neuropeptide Identification

While  neuropeptides  can  be  identified  by  comparing 
experimental peptide masses obtained from MS data against 
a  list  of  known  neuropeptide  masses,  they  are  typically 
identified  with  both  MS  and  MS/MS  fragmentation  data. 
While  collision-induced  dissociation  is  widely  used  for 
peptide identification, other fragmentation methods, such 
as higher energy collision dissociation and electron transfer 
dissociation,  have  recently  improved  the  identification 
capability  of  peptides  and  PTM  localization  [41-43].  The 
automated identification of neuropeptides based on their MS 
and MS/MS data is pursued by using proteomic-based search 
engines,  such  as  Mascot,  SEQUEST,  X!Tandem,  Peaks 
Studio,  and  ProSightPC  [37,  44-47].  Since  peptidomics 
searches  typically  employ  criteria,  such  as  no  enzymatic 
cleavage  and  various  common  modifications  (e.g., 
N-terminal  acetylation  and  C-terminal  amidation),  they 
often require a larger search space and longer search times 
for peptide identification. Several neuropeptide prohormone 
databases,  including  SwePep,  have  been  constructed  to 
facilitate neuropeptide identification, and cleavage predic-
tion  programs,  such  as  NeuroPred,  were  developed  to 
predict cleavage sites in prohormones and to provide the 
masses of the resulting peptides [48, 49]. In addition to the 
database  search  strategies,  neuropeptides  can  be  also 
identified by de novo sequencing, especially when the species 
of interest does not have a sequenced genome. While peptide 
spectra  are  compared  with  theoretical  peptides  in  the 
database search strategy, de novo sequencing, which is the 
direct  assignment  of  the  amino  acid  sequence  from  the 
MS/MS spectrum, can be pursued when the database is not 
available.  Although  de  novo  sequencing  can  be  performed 
manually, the process is labor-intensive and time- consu-
ming. There are several software packages that can perform 
de  novo  sequencing  directly  on  MS/MS  data,  including 
Lutefisk  (http://www.hairyfatguy.com/lutefisk/),  Mascot

The peptide sequences obtained from de novo sequencing are 
often  compared  with  the  nonredundant  database  of  the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information to establish 
the peptide identities with the Basic Local Alignment Search 
Tool  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.  gov/BLAST).  The  BLAST 
search compares a partial neuropeptide sequence against the 
database of a closely related species.

Quantitative Neuropeptidomics

MS-based  peptidomic  techniques  allow  for  measuring 
relative  levels  of  peptides  in  different  conditions  of  the 
samples, as well as peptide identification. Quantitation of 
peptides based on MS is generally achieved either by stable 
isotope labeling or label-free approaches (Fig. 3) [50, 51]. In 
stable isotope labeling, the relative levels of peptides in two 
different  samples  are  typically  examined  by  labeling  the 
peptides in one sample with a light stable isotope and those 
in the other sample with a heavy stable isotope; the two 
samples  are  then  combined  and  analyzed  together.  The 
relative levels of the peptides are calculated by the difference 
in the MS peaks (peak intensity or peak area) of the two 
samples. While the stable isotopes can be introduced to the 
peptides either metabolically or through chemical reactions, 
isotope labeling through chemical reactions enables one to 
obtain  quantitative  information  from  biological  samples, 
such as brain tissues, for which metabolic labeling is not 
available.  A  number  of  different  isotopic  tags,  including 

acetic anhydride, succinic anhydride, and trimethylammo-
nium  butyrate  (TMAB),  have  been  used  for  quantitative 
analyses  of  endogenous  peptides  in  various  samples  and 
conditions [6, 34, 52]. For example, the TMAB tag was used 
to evaluate the relative changes of endogenous peptides in 
response to food intake or drug treatment [53-55] and to 
assess  the  role  of  protein  convertase  1/3  and  2  in  the 
processing  of  the  peptides  in  mouse  models  [56,  57].  In 
label-free methods, each sample is prepared separately and 
then subjected directly to individual LC-MS or LC-MS/MS 
runs, followed by comparisons of either the mass spectral 
peak intensities of the detected peptides or the total number 
of MS/MS spectra identified for a peptide, called spectral 
counting  [51].  Since  there  is  no  limit  to  the  number  of 
samples that can be compared, label-free quantitation allows 
for the comparison of multiple samples or conditions. The 
approach has been used to measure the changes in the levels 
of neuropeptides present during the daytime and nighttime 
in  the  rat  SCN  [58,  59]  and  to  examine  the  expression 
changes of endogenous peptides involved in the embryo-
genesis  of  Japanese  quail  brains  [60]  and  the  nucleus 
accumbens of morphine-dependent rats [61]. In addition, 
quantitative peptidomic analyses based on peak intensities 
has enabled us to discover endogenous peptides associated 
with repeated exposure to amphetamine and with individual 
variations in sensitivity to the behavioral effects of cocaine in 
rat models [62, 63].

stable  isotope  labeling  (A)  or  label-free  approaches  (B).  In  stable  isotope  labeling,  the  endogenous  peptides  in  two  different  samples  are 
labeled with either a light stable isotope or a heavy stable isotope, and the two samples are then combined and analyzed together. The 
relative  levels  of  the  peptides  are  calculated  by  the  difference  in  the  MS  peaks  (peak  intensity  or  peak  area)  of  the  two  samples.  In 

label-free quantitation, each sample is prepared separately and then subjected to individual liquid chromatography (LC)-MS or LC–tandem

mass  spectrometry  (MS/MS)  runs,  followed  by  comparisons  of  either  the  mass  spectral  peak  intensities  of  the  detected  peptides  or  the 
total  number  of  MS/MS  spectra  identified  for  a  peptide,  called  spectral  counting.

Conclusion

Neuropeptides are important signaling molecules that are 
involved in many kinds of physiological processes, including 
addiction,  depression,  mood  regulation,  and  circadian 
rhythms.  Because  of  their  biological  significance,  neuro-
peptides have become key targets in drug discovery. While 
immunological techniques, such as RIA and IHC, require a 
priori knowledge of neuropeptides and only detect peptide 
sequences with known structures, MS enables one to detect 
and identify the precise forms of neuropeptides without a 
priori  knowledge  of  peptide  identity,  resulting  in  the 
identification  of  previously  unknown  neuropeptides.  In 
addition, MS-based quantitative analyses of neuropeptides 
based on either stable isotope labeling or label-free methods 
provide information on the relative levels of neuropeptides 
in different physiological conditions, which can be helpful in 
understanding  the  function  of  the  neuropeptides.  Conti-
nuous efforts to implement current MS-based peptidomics 
techniques for neuropeptide identification and quantitation 
are  expected  to  provide  more  profound  insights  into  the 
neurochemical  communication  of  neurons  in  various 
physiological processes.
