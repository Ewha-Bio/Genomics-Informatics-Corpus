Abstract 
We  have investigated  biological  responses to  radiofre(cid:173)
quency (RF) radiation in in vitro and in vivo models.  By 
measuring the levels of heat shock proteins as well as the 
activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 
we could not detect any differences upon RF exposure. In 
this  study,  we  used  more sensitive  method  to  find  the 
molecular  responses  to  RF  radiation.  Jurkat,  human 
T -lymphocyte  cells  were  exposed  to  1763  MHz  RF 
radiation at an average specific absorption rate (SAR) of 
10 W/kg for one hour and harvested immediately (RO) or 
after five hours (R5).  From the profiles of 30,000 genes, 
we  selected  68  differentially  expressed  genes  among 
sham  (S),  RO  and  R5  groups using a random-variance 
F-test.  Especially 45  annotated  genes were  related  to 
metabolism, apoptosis or transcription regulation. Based 
on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, we designed 
prediction  model  using  68  genes  to  discriminate  three 
groups.  Our  prediction  model  could  predict  the  target 
class of 19 among 20 examples exactly (95% accuracy). 
From these data, we could  select the 68  biomarkers to 
predict the  RF  radiation  exposure  with  high  accuracy, 
which might need to be validated in  in vivo models.

creased world-widely, the concerns about possible health 
effect upon RF radiation raised among the public as well 
as health care providers. Mostly the carcinogenic effects 
were studied intensively during last several decades on 
colon cancer (Wu eta/., 1994 ), mammary tumor (Toler et 
a/.,  1997),  liver cancer (lmaida eta/.,  1998),  lymphoma 
(Repacholi eta/., 1997), brain tumor (Salford eta/., 1997) 
and skin tumorigenesis (Huang eta!., 2005). However, the 
relationship between cancer and RF radiation seems to be 
not so evident. At the molecular levels, the effects of RF ra(cid:173)
diation on DNA damage, chromatin conformation (Belyaev 
et a/.,  2006),  permeability  of blood-brain  barrier  (BBB) 
(Persson eta/., 1997), the concentration of zinc ions (Aksen 
eta/., 2004),  and the activities of ornithine decarboxylase 
(ODC) (Paul raj eta/., 2002) were studied and reported to be 
negative. In our recent study for stress response on RF ra(cid:173)
diation,  1763MHz  RF  radiation  did  not  induce  the  ex(cid:173)
pression of heat shock proteins or activate MAPKs in mice 
whole-body exposure model (Lee eta/., 2005a). 

In  in vitro studies using C3H101/2 cells,  exposure to 
835.62 MHz and 84 7. 7 4 MHz could induce the expression 
of FOS (Goswami eta/., 1999). The up-regulations of heat 
shock  proteins  (HSPs)  were  also  reported  in  human 
glioma M054 cells at a relatively high SAR of more than 
20 W/kg but not at 5 W/kg {Tian eta!., 2002). Leszczynskin 
et a/.  (2002)  also  reported  the  phosphorylation  HSP27 
upon  one  hour  exposure  to  900  MHz  RF  radiation  in 
human endothelial cells. However, the molecular effect of 
RF  radiation  is still  debated  by reports on  the failure to 
detect any changes in the same targets.  No changes in 
the expression and activation of FOS in C3H1 01/2 cells at 
5 W/kg and 10 W/kg SAR of RF radiations were reported 
(Whitehead  et a/.,  2005)  and  no  statistical  significant 
difference was detected in the number of cells expressing 
stress proteins (HSP70 and  HSP27) upon  900MHz RF 
radiation (Lim eta/., 2005). Lantow eta/. (2006) reported 
altered HSP70 expression level was not observed after 
co-exposure to RF EMFs+PMA or RF EMFs+LPS. 

Microarray  technology  can  provide  powerful  in(cid:173)

posed to 1763 GHz RF radiation were examined their ex(cid:173)
pression patterns to select genes related to RF radiation 
(Lee eta/., 2005b ).  Radiofrequency radiation; mobile phone; 
gene expression microarray; support vector machine In this 
study, we tried to find biomarkers to predict the RF-exposed 
cells  from  sham- exposed  one  using  gene  expression 
profiles. Then we developed models to predict the exposure 
to RF radiation using support vector machine (SVM) algo(cid:173)
rithm (Vapnik, V.N.,  1998)with selected biomarkers based 
on the Weka environment (Witten and Frank, 2005). 

Methods 
Cell culture and in vitro radiofrequency radiation 
exposure system 
Jurkat  cells  were  incubated  in  RPMI  1640  medium 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JBI, Korea), 
2 mM glutamine,  125 units/ml penicillin,  and  125 f.lg/ml 
streptomycin at 3rC in  a humidified incubator with 5% 
C02.  For the  RF-EMFs exposure,  cells  were grown  in 
2.5  x  105 cells/ml 16 hours prior to the exposure. 

In vitro RF exposure system is specially designed for 
this study in a rectangular-cavity type (Lee eta/., 2005 a). 
A real CMDA signal1763 MHz is applied to the chamber 
maintaining  proper  environmental  conditions  like  a 
ventilation, humidity, and temperature in C02 incubator. 
In  addition,  a  cooling  device circulating  water through 
the bottom of the exposure chamber is used to prevent 
the change in temperature upon RF exposure. 

RF exposure design 
Jurkat cells were exposed to  10 W/kg of 1763 MHz RF 
radiation for one hour or one hour a day for 7 days. Cells 
were  harvested  immediately  as  RO  groups  like  sham 
(SRO) and PCS-exposed (PRO), and cells were incubated 
for 5 hours to recover from acute response as R5 groups 
like  sham  R5  (SR5)  and  PCS-exposed  (PR5).  We 
repeated sets of experiment five times to collect biological 
triplicates in every sample. 

RNA extraction and microarray 
Samples  in  each  group were  harvested  and  their total 
RNAs  were  extracted  by  dissolving  in  TriZol  (Sigma). 
After the fractions containing  RNA were collected,  total 
RNAs  were  purified  using  Qiagen  RNAeasy  column 
again.  The  array  used  in  this  experiment was Applied 
Biosystems  1700  full  genome  expression  human 
microarray which  includes  30,000  human  genes  from 
the public and Celera database (http://www.pantherdb.org/). 

Data analysis 
Fluorescence intensity was processed and measured us(cid:173)
ing Applied Biosystems 1700 Chemiluminescent Microarray 
Analyzer. Intensity data were imported to an in-house mi(cid:173)
croarray database. Quantile normalization was applied to 
remove systematic variance. Quantile normalization is a 
simple yet powerful method to normalize across arrays by 
making the distribution of probe intensities for each array 
in a set of arrays the same, and reduces the variance slight(cid:173)
ly better than Lowess normalization (Bolstad eta/., 2003). 
We identified genes that were differentially expressed 
among the three classes using a random-variance F-test. 
The random variance F-test is an  improvement over the 
standard separate F-test as it permits sharing information 
among genes about within-class validation without assum(cid:173)
ing that all genes have the same variance (Wright, 2003). 
Then we identified gene ontology (The Gene Ontology 
Consortium,  2000) groups of genes whose expression 
was  differentially  regulated  among  the  classes.  This 
analysis is different than annotating a gene list using GO 
categories.  The  GO  analysis  is  to  give  information 
whether or not the list of significant genes selected by the 
analysis is different from  a gene list randomly selected 
from all genes in the analysis, for a given GO category. 
This is expressed by the observed vs. expected ratio. The 
observed is defined as the number of genes in the list of 
significant  genes  which  fall  into  a  GO  category.  The 
expected  is  defined  as  the  average  number  of genes 
which would be expected to fall into that GO category in 
a subset of genes randomly selected from the genes in 
the analysis. A GO category is considered to consist of not 
only the genes which are described by that GO term, but 
also any gene which is described by any children of that 
GO term. 

Prediction Model 
We developed models for utilizing gene expression profile 
to predict the class of future samples using support vector 
machine (SVM) algorithm (Vapnik,  1998) based on  the 
Weka  environment  (Witten  and  Frank,  2005).  Support 
vector machines have exhibited superb performance in 
binary  classification  tasks.  Intuitively,  SVM  aims  at 
searching for a hyperplane that separates the two classes 
of data with the largest margin between the hyperplane 
and the point closest to it. There are some studies about 
multiclass decomposition  techniques for SVM  such  as 
one-versus-the  rest,  pairwise  comparison  and  error(cid:173)
correcting output coding (ECOC), and they have showed 
good  performance  than  other  multiclass  classification 
algorithms.  We  use  a  sequential  minimal  optimization 
algorithm with a logistic regression model and RBF kernel

for training a support vector classifier {Platt,  1998). 

Results and Discussion 
RF exposure to Jurkat T cells 
Upon  the  exposure  to  1763MHz  RF  radiation,  Jurkat 
cells did not show any change in cell  morphologies and 

growth.  We kept the cells  in  C02  incubator while cells 
were  exposed  to  RF  radiation.  RF  radiation  might 
produce heat in the culture media,  but isothermal water 
at 3rc circulated continuously at the bottom of chamber 
through the experiment.  Because we kept the chamber 
inside of C02 incubator, they were completely shielded 
from any electromagnetic field radiation generated from 
other electronic sources. For sham group, we assembled

exactly  same  experimental  set  up  for  RF  exposure 
without applying the current. 

Feature  selection  to  distinguish  among  Sham, 
PRO, and PR5 
We  designed  the  experiments  to  identify  the  genes 
differentially expressed among the three classes- sham, 
PRO,  and  PR5-using  a  random-variance F-test.  Genes 
whose p-value were less than 0.05 were considered as 
statistically significant ones.  By the statistical  analysis, 
we selected 68 differentially expressed genes and listed 
fully annotated 45 genes in Table 1. Even though the numbers 
of genes listed here were quite small,  we could  detect the 
transcriptional changes in Jurkat cells upon RF-radiation. 

Although there were sizable numbers of un-annotated 
genes  in  the  feature  gene  lists,  we  analyzed  GO 
categories  for  just  annotated  genes.  Using  the  GO 
analysis, we could characterize the biological responses 
to RF radiation  in Jurkat T cells. As we summarized the 
categories  in  Table  2  and  Table  3,  cellular  responses 
require  the  changes  in  the  expression  of transcription 
factors  and  kinase  enzymes.  Especially  those  genes 
were related to apoptosis and cellular metabolism. 

Prediction Model 
The models incorporated 68 genes that were differentially 
expressed among genes at the 0.05 significance level as 
assessed by the random variance F-test. We estimated 
the  prediction  error  of  the  model  with  1 0-fold  cross(cid:173)
validation.  Specifically,  10-fold  cross-validation  means 
that the available examples are partitioned into 10 disjoint 
subsets.  The cross-validation procedure is then run  1 0 
times, each time using one of the 10 subsets as the test 
set and the others for training sets. 

The performance criteria that we used are as follows: 

Accuracy  = (TN + TP)  Â· 1 00 I (TP + FP + FN+ TN) 
= (TP)  Â·  1 00 I (TP + FN) 
TP-rate 
= (FP)  Â·  100 I (FP + FN) 
FP-rate 
Precision  = (TP)  Â·  1 00 I (TP + FP) 
F-measure= 2 Â· Precision  Â· Recall I (Precision+ Recall) 

= (2TP)  Â·  100 I (2TP + FP + FN) 

The accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified 
examples among total examples. The true positive rate 
(TP-rate)  is  the  proportion  of  examples  that  were 
classified as class x, among all examples that truly have 
class x,  i.e.  how much  of the class was captured.  It  is 
equivalent to Recall. The false positive rate (FP-rate) is 
the proportion of examples that were classified as class 
x,  but  belong  to  a  different class,  among  all  examples 
that are not of class x.  The precision of the proportion of 
the  examples  that  truly  have  class  x  among  all  those 
which were classified as class x.  F-measure is a single 
measure  that  characterizes  recall  and  precision.  Our 
prediction model predicted the target class of 19 among 
20 examples exactly (95% accuracy). One dataset from 
PR5 class was misclassified as a sham class (Table 4).
