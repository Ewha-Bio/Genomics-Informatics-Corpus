The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one mechanism by which cells with mesenchymal features can be generated 
and is a fundamental event in morphogenesis. Recently, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells from the primary tumor are 
now thought to be initiated by the developmental process termed the EMT, whereby epithelial cells lose cell polarity and 
cell-cell  interactions,  and  gain  mesenchymal  phenotypes  with  increased  migratory  and  invasive  properties.  The  EMT  is 
believed to be an important step in metastasis and is implicated in cancer progression, although the influence of the EMT in 
clinical specimens has been debated. This review presents the recent results of two cell surface proteins, the functions and 
underlying mechanisms of which have recently begun to be demonstrated, as novel regulators of the molecular networks 
that induce the EMT and cancer progression.

Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 

Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 
most cancer types. As an initial step in cancer metastasis, 
epithelial tumor cells in general disseminate from a primary 
solid tumor mass and invade into the surrounding stromal 
tissues. Invasion is enhanced by tumor cell activation of the 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [1-4]. The EMT is 
characterized by the loss of epithelial apicobasal polarity and 
cell-cell  contacts,  modulation  of  cell-matrix  adhesion, 
enhanced proteolytic activity, cytoskeletal remodeling, and 
acquisition  of  the  ability  to  migrate  and  invade  the 
extracellular  matrix  (ECM)  [1,  3].  During  the  EMT, 
epithelial cells undergo molecular changes; epithelial cells 
gradually lose their epithelial markers, such as E- cadherin, 
ZO-1, and cytokeratins, and concomitantly acquire mesen-
chymal markers, such as vimentin, fibronectin, N- cadherin, 
and  alpha  smooth  muscle  actin  [1,  3].  The  EMT  plays  a 
critical role in the formation of various tissues and organs, 
such as the mesoderm, neural crest, heart, secondary palate, 

and peripheral nervous systems, during embryonic develop-
ment and wound healing in adult organism [2, 4]. Further-
more, the EMT is implicated in pathological processes, such 
as tumor cell invasion and metastasis and organ fibrosis [2]. 
One of the hallmarks of the EMT is the functional loss of 
E-cadherin, which is currently thought to be a metastasis 
suppressor  [5].  Downregulation  of  E-cadherin  is  usually 
mediated  by  E-cadherin  transcriptional  repressors/EMT- 
inducing  transcription  factors,  including  the  Snail  super-
family of zinc-finger factors (Snail and Slug), the ZEB family 
(ZEB1 and ZEB2), and basic helix-loop-helix factors (Twist1 
and E47), which have been associated with tumor invasion 
and metastasis [4, 5]. These factors repress transcription of 
E-cadherin by interacting with proximal E-box elements in 
the E-cadherin promoter [5]. In addition, these E-cadherin 
repressors  may  be  directly  or  indirectly  involved  in  the 
upregulation of certain mesenchymal genes [5], although 
the precise mechanism of this regulation is largely unknown.
The EMT is triggered by soluble growth factors, such as 
members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and

fibroblast growth factor families, epidermal growth factor, 
and  hepatocyte  growth  factor  (HGF)  [3,  4].  Subsequent 
activation of receptor-mediated signaling triggers the activa-
tion of intracellular effector molecules, such as members of 
the small GTPase family, leading to changes in cytoskeletal 
organization,  and  also  results  in  the  activation  of  EMT- 
inducing transcription factors [3, 4]. In addition, compo-
nents of the ECM, such as collagen, and activation of integrin 
co-receptors  are  also  involved  in  the  EMT  process  [3]. 
Certain proteases are sufficient to induce the EMT [2]; for 
example, matrix metalloproteinase-3 triggers the EMT by 
increasing  the  cellular  levels  of  reactive  oxygen  species, 
which in turn induces Snail expression [6]. 

Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been identified as a 
novel class of EMT regulators; miRs that negatively regulate 
the EMT include miR-153, -155, -194, -25, -212, and -200, 
and miRs that positively regulate the EMT include miR-29a, 
-103/107, -150, and -221/22 [7]. miRs regulate invasion and 
metastasis  by  targeting  the  transcripts  of  various  genes 
involved in the EMT event, including EMT-inducing tran-
scription  factors.  For  example,  members  of  the  miR-200 
family are negative regulators of the EMT and are essential 
for maintenance of the epithelial status through the down-
regulation of ZEB1 and ZEB2. In turn, miR-200 members are 
transcriptionally  repressed  by  ZEB1  and  ZEB2,  thus 
establishing a double-negative feedback loop [8]. 

The EMT was recently shown to be linked to stemness and 
self-renewal capacity [9, 10]. In cases of breast cancer stems, 
the  linkage  among  EMT  phenotype,  stemness,  and  drug 
resistance has been well studied [11]. Further, epithelial- 
mesenchymal plasticity (consisting of EMT and MET) is also 
described in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) [12-14]. CTCs 
with various degrees of EMT phenotypes are found during 
breast cancer metastasis [15]. Therefore, CTCs may involve 
self-renewal  capacity,  which is linked to the EMT, during 
cancer metastasis [16].

Transmembrane Protease Serine 4 (TMPRSS4)
Introduction to type II transmembrane serine 
proteases

Dysregulation of proteases is a hallmark of cancer pro-
gression; thus, proteases in general have been the subject of 
numerous cancer studies. Extracellular proteolytic enzymes, 
including  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs)  and  serine 
proteases, contribute to tumor cell invasion and metastasis 
through both direct proteolytic activity and the regulation of 
cellular signaling and functions [17-19]. Most members of 
the serine protease family are either secreted or sequestered 
in cytoplasmic organelles awaiting signal-regulated release. 
Recently, type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  1,  2014

have been recognized as a new subfamily of serine proteases 
that have in common an extracellular proteolytic domain, a 
single-pass  transmembrane  domain,  a  short  intracellular 
domain,  and  a  variable-length  stem  region  containing 
modular structural domains [20-24]. Enteropeptidase (also 
known as enterokinase), identified over a century ago due to 
its pivotal role in food digestion, is the first TTSP, which was 
revealed by molecular cloning of the enteropeptidase cDNA 
two decades ago [25]. TMPRSS2, human airway trypsin-like 
protease  (HAT),  corin,  and  matriptase  have  been 
subsequently identified as cell surface-associated proteases 
[23, 24]. To date, 20 TTSPs have been identified in mouse 
and  humans  due  to  the  analysis  of  sequence  data  from 
mammalian  genome  projects  [23].  Analysis  of  the  tissue 
distribution of TTSPs and gene targeting in mice of certain 
TTSPs suggested that a significant number of TTSPs may 
have  important  functions  in  embryonic  development  and 
homeostasis  of  mammalian  tissues,  such  as  heart,  skin, 
inner ear, placenta, and digestive tract [23, 24]. 

Most  TTSPs  are  overexpressed  in  a  variety  of  tumors 
compared to normal tissues, implicating their potential as 
novel markers of tumor development and progression and 
possible molecular targets for anti-cancer therapeutics [23, 
26].  Recently,  a  number  of  works  have  focused  on  the 
evaluation  of  the  expression  of  individual  TTSPs  during 
tumor progression and on the investigation of the potential 
roles  of  these  proteases  in  tumor  cell  proliferation, 
migration, and invasion [23, 27].

TMPRSS4 in cancer

TMPRSS4  (gene  ID,  56649;  chromosomal  location, 
11q23.3), initially referred to as TMPRSS3, was originally 
identified  as  a  gene  expressed  in  most  pancreatic  cancer 
tissues  but  not  in  the  normal  pancreas  or  chronic 
pancreatitis [28]. To date, 7 isoforms have been reported. 
The deduced sequence of 437 amino acids of the longest 
isoform (isoform 1) contains a serine protease domain with 
putative trypsin-like activity and a transmembrane domain 
[28]. In human, TMPRSS4 mRNA was detected in bladder, 
esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and kidney [28], 
although  the  physiological  roles  of  TMPRSS4  remain 
unknown.  Furthermore,  TMPRSS4  expression  was  upre-
gulated in malignant compared to benign thyroid neoplasm 
and  was  suggested  as  both  a  diagnostic  and  prognostic 
marker [29, 30]. TMPRSS4 was associated with poor prog-
nosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with squamous 
cell  histology  [31],  triple-negative  breast  cancer  [32], 
cervical cancer [33], and gastric cancer patients [34]. Kim et 
al. [35] reported that TMPRSS4 mRNA levels were upre-
gulated in colorectal cancer tissues versus adjacent normal 
mucosa. The authors also reported that TMPRSS4 protein

expression  was  significantly  higher  in  human  colorectal 
cancer tissues from advanced stages (52.5% and 50.0% of 
stages III and IV, respectively) than in that of early stage 
(6.3% in stage I), suggesting that TMPRSS4 may play a role 
in  the  progression  of  non-invasive  tumors  to  invasive 
malignancies [35]. Jia et al. [36] showed that the inhibitory 
tripeptide tyroserleutide led to downregulation of TMPRSS4 
in  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC),  thereby  reducing  the 
invasion  and  metastasis  of  HCC  induced  by  irradiation. 
Taken together, TMPRSS4 may be a novel biomarker for the 
prognosis of certain types of cancers and could be employed 
for diagnostics and therapeutics. 

On the other hand, the mechanism by which TMPRSS4 
expression is modulated has not been well characterized. 
Recently, Nguyen et al. [37] reported that TMPRSS4 was 
increased  in  NSCLC  cells  under  hypoxic  conditions, 
suggesting  that  hypoxia  within  the  tumor  microen-
vironment may upregulate TMPRSS4 expression. 

Function of TMPRSS4 in the regulation of EMT and 
invasion

In colon cancer cells, TMPRSS4 induces downregulation 
of  E-cadherin  and  leads  to  EMT  events,  accompanying 
morphological changes and actin reorganization [38]. Sup-
pression  of  TMPRSS4  by  siRNA  reduces  cell  invasion  in 
colon and lung cancer cells, while overexpression TMPRSS4 
induces migration, invasion, and metastasis [38]. Attach-
ment and spreading of cells on the ECM, with concomitant 
formation  of  stress  fibers  and  focal  adhesions,  is  a  pre-
requisite  for  cell  migration.  TMPRSS4  also  modulates 
cell-matrix  adhesion  and  cell  spreading  mainly  through 
modulation  of  integrins,  such  as  α5β1,  which  has  been 
centrally implicated in the EMT and cell motility [39, 40], 
which probably contributes to enhanced motility and invasi-
veness.  One  of  the  molecular  mechanisms  by  which 
TMPRSS4 mediates the EMT and invasiveness in tumor cells 
is  that  TMPRSS4  mediates  focal  adhesion  kinase  (FAK) 
signaling  pathway  activation  and  extracellular  signal- 
regulated kinase (ERK) activation, mainly through integrin 
α5  upregulation,  leading  to  the  EMT  and  invasiveness. 
Furthermore, TMPRSS4 overexpression in human colorectal 
cancer tissues positively correlates with enhanced expres-
sion of integrin α5 and inversely correlates with E-cadherin 
expression,  confirming  that  TMPRSS4  modulates  expres-
sion of EMT markers. Recently, Larzabal et al. [41] reported 
that miR-205 is involved in TMPRSS4-induced integrin α5 
expression in NSCLC cells. To further implicate TMPRSS4 in 
the  EMT,  Cheng  et  al.  [42]  suggested  that  interactions 
between  HGF  activator  inhibitor  (HAI-1)  and  TMPRSS4 
contribute to EMT events, including E-cadherin reduction 
and  morphological  changes  in  pancreatic  cancer  cells.  In 

addition, TMPRSS4-induced E-cadherin reduction and EMT 
play a critical role in radiation-induced long-term metastasis 
of residual HCC in nude mice [43]. 

Interaction of TMPRSS4 and integrin α5, based on the 
observation that TMPRSS4 partially interacts with integrin 
α5  under  certain  coimmunoprecipitation  conditions  in  a 
cell  line-dependent  manner  [35]  (Kim  S,  unpublished 
observation), suggests the possibility that TMPRSS4 may 
modulate or participate in the interaction of integrin and 
other  cell  surface  proteins  (for  example,  tetraspanin, 
receptor  tyrosine  kinases,  etc.),  leading  to  subsequent 
signaling  transduction  activation.  In  fact,  TMPRSS4  can 
interact  with  urokinase  plasminogen  activator  receptor 
(uPAR; CD87) [44], which can induce the EMT in hypoxic 
breast  cancer  cells  [45],  although  it  is  not  clear  whether 
TMPRSS4 interacts with uPAR directly or via integrin(s). 

Loss  or  reduction  of  E-cadherin  expression  is  a  well- 
known hallmark of the EMT and correlates positively with 
tumor cell invasion and metastasis [3]. TMPRSS4 appears to 
modulate SIP1/ZEB2 expression, based on the observation 
that  SIP1  mRNA  is  upregulated  in  TMPRSS4-overex-
pressing colon cancer cells, although induction of SIP1 at the 
protein  level  remains  to  be  determined.  Therefore,  it  is 
possible that SIP1 mediates TMPRSS4-induced EMT events, 
including E-cadherin reduction. 

Several  studies  have  shown  that  suppression  of  high 
endogenous  E-cadherin  expression  renders  non-invasive 
cells  partially  invasive  [46],  whereas  reconstitution  of 
E-cadherin results in tumor cell reversion from an invasive 
mesenchymal phenotype to a benign epithelial phenotype 
[46, 47]. In contrast, other studies have shown that ectopic 
expression of E-cadherin could not reverse EMT phenotypes 
induced by the transcription factor Twist1 [10]. On the other 
hand,  downregulation  of  E-cadherin  was  required  for 
TMPRSS4-mediated EMT and invasion in colon cancer cells 
but  was  not  sufficient  for  induction  of  these  phenotypes

[35], suggesting that downregulation of E-cadherin is not 
the sole contributor to TMPRSS4-mediated phenotypes. In 
this respect, upregulation of specific mesenchymal markers, 
such as integrin α5, besides the downregulation of E-cad-
herin by TMPRSS4, may be required for full invasiveness 
during colon cancer progression (Fig. 1). 

Molecular mechanisms and signals regulated by 
TMPRSS4 

Numerous studies have focused on the investigation of in 
vivo  substrates  of  TTSPs.  However,  few  studies  have 
conclusively  addressed  the  in  vivo  molecular  targets  and 
function of TTSPs during tumor progression. In vitro, several 
TTSPs, including matriptase, were shown to activate pro- 
urokinase plasminogen activator, pro-macrophage stimula-
ting protein-1, and pro-HGF, which are implicated in the 
proliferation, migration and invasion of various cancer cell 
types [23]. 

Like most of the members of the TTSP family, TMPRSS4 
can  activate  epithelial  sodium  channel  (ENaC)  in  vitro 
through its proteolytic activity, possibly regulating sodium 
and  water  flux  across  high-resistance  epithelia  [48,  49]. 
TMPRSS4 induces cancer cell invasion in a manner that is 
dependent on serine proteolytic activity [38], and inhibitory 
compounds against TMPRSS4 serine protease activity were 
reported to reduce colon cancer cell invasion [50]. However, 
it remains unknown which precursor substrates are cleaved 
by TMPRSS4 to contribute to tumor progression. On the 
other  hand,  it  has  recently  been  reported  that  TMPRSS4 
induces  urokinase  plasminogen  activator  (uPA)  gene  ex-
pression through activation of the transcription factors AP-1, 
Sp1, and Sp3 in mainly a JNK-dependent manner in prostate 
and lung cancer cells but not in colon cancer cells [44]. uPA 
is a  well-known serine  protease involved  in  invasion  and 
metastasis  and  correlates  with  poor  prognosis  in  breast, 
lung, stomach, bladder, colon, prostate, and ovarian cancers 
[51], and TMPRSS4 expression significantly correlates with 
uPA  expression  in  human  lung  and  prostate  adenocar-
cinomas  [44].  In  addition,  TMPRSS4-mediated  uPA  ex-
pression contributes to prostate cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1) 
[44]. It is intriguing that TMPRSS4 activates JNK signaling 
pathways,  possibly  through  its  association  with  uPAR, 
leading to uPA expression. uPAR can induce the EMT and 
stem cell-like properties in breast cancer cells by activating 
diverse cell signaling pathways, including ERK, phospho-
inositide-3-kinase-Akt,  and  Rac1  [45,  52].  Therefore,  the 
association  of  TMPRSS4  and  uPAR  and  subsequent  cell 
signaling  modulation  may  be  a  novel  mechanism  for  the 
control of invasion and the EMT. 

The observations that TMPRSS4 modulates cell signaling 
and  subsequently  activates  both  AP-1  and  Sp1/3  trans-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  1,  2014

criptional activities [44], which have been reported to be 
involved in the transcriptional regulation of the EMT and 
invasion [53], suggest that TMPRSS4 could modulate the 
expression of various genes, which may be associated with 
invasion and metastasis. 

Transmembrane  4  L  Six  Family  Member  5 
(TM4SF5) 
The tetraspanins

Tetraspanins (TM4SFs) have four transmembrane protein 
domains with two extracellular loops and one intracellular 
loop (ICL) and the N- and C-terminal tails [54]. They are 
expressed on the cell surface and/or intracellular vesicles 
and contain 33 members in mammals [55]. Tetraspanins, or 
TM4SFs, are suggested to be located at tetraspanin-enriched 
microdomains  (TERMs)  [56],  where  they  form  protein- 
protein complexes in a homophilic or heterophilic manner 
with other TM4SFs, integrins, or growth factor receptors 
[57, 58]. The protein complexes are known to regulate the 
dynamics of the complex components on the cell surface 
with regard to diffusion, trafficking, retention, and stability, 
in addition to influencing intracellular signal transductions 
[56, 59, 60]. 

TM4SF5 in cancer

TM4SF5  (gene  ID,  9032)  maps  to  chromosome  17  at 
17p13.3  according  to  Entrez  Gene.  In  AceView,  it  covers 
11.34 kb, from 4621928 to 4633262 (NCBI 36, March 2006), 
on the direct strand containing 4 different gt-ag introns. Its 
transcription  produces  2  alternatively  spliced  mRNAs  via 
alternative polyadenylation sites, which putatively encode 2 
different isoforms (197 and 132 amino acids), containing an 
L6 membrane domain (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ 
Research/Acembly/av.cgi?db=35g&c=Gene&l=TM4SF5). 
TM4SF5 (20,823 Da) is a transmembrane glycoprotein; as a 
family group, it is related to the tetraspanin family (trans-
membrane 4 L six family), including TM4SF1 (L6, L6-Ag), 
TM4SF4 (IL-TIMP), TM4SF518 (L6D), and TM4SF20 [61, 
62]. TM4SF5 is highly expressed in diverse types of cancers, 
including  liver,  pancreatic,  gastric,  colon,  adrenocorti-
cotropic hormone (corticotropin)-negative bronchial carci-
noid tumors, soft-tissue sarcoma, nonendocrine lung, and 
papilla  vateri  carcinoma  [63-66].  Similar  to  tetraspanins 
(i.e., transmembrane 4 superfamily, TM4SFs), TM4SF5 has 
four  transmembrane  domains  (TM1-TM4),  short  cyto-
plasmic domains at their N- and C-termini, an ICL between 
TM2  and  TM4,  two  extracellular  loops,  a  smaller  ex-
tracellular  loop  between  TM1  and  TM2,  and  a  larger 
extracellular loop between TM3 and TM4 [61, 62]. Recent 
clinical  studies  separately  report  that  TM4SF5  is  highly

expressed in tumors from deceased breast cancer patients, 
compared  to  those  from  10-year  breast  cancer  survivors 
[67],  and  that  postoperative  5-year  overall  survival  of 
esophageal  cancer  patients  negatively  correlates  with 
TM4SF5  expression  [68].  These  reports  suggest  that 
TM4SF5 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis of 
cancer patients. 

TM4SF5-mediated regulation of signaling molecules

TM4SF5 can appear to form TERMs on the cell surface, via 
formation of large protein-protein complexes with tetras-
panins,  integrins,  and  growth  factor  receptors  [61,  69]. 
Therefore, by virtue of the protein complex formation, over-
expressed TM4SF5 in cancer cells can influence or activate 
diverse intracellular signaling  pathways for cell adhesion, 
proliferation, the EMT, migration, and invasion for tumor 
progression and maintenance.

TM4SF5 is shown to associate with integrins α2, β1 [70, 
71], α5 [72], and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
[73, 74] during cell migration [70, 71], angiogenesis [72], 
drug resistance [74], and fibrosis [73]. With association and 
retention of integrin α5 on the cell surface, TM4SF5 can 
activate  intracellular  signaling  for  FAK/c-Src  activation, 
leading to STAT3 activity for vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) induction [72]. In addition, TM4SF5 directly 
interacts with FAK or c-Src to regulate migration [75] and 
invasive ECM degradation [76]. In addition, TM4SF5 ex-
pression  causes  AKT  activation,  which  in  turn  causes 
phosphorylation of p27Kip1 Ser10 for its cytosolic translo-
cation, where it can regulate RhoA activity for morphological 
change and migratory function [74].

TM4SF5-mediated EMT in tumor progression

TM4SF5  expression  in  hepatocytes  or  NSCLC  leads  to 
EMT  phenotypes,  which  in  turn  cause  loss  of  contact 
inhibition [74], enhance migration and invasion for meta-
stasis [77], and render gefitinib resistance [78]. TM4SF5 
expression causes morphological changes through abnormal 
regulation of RhoA and Rac1 in hepatocytes, together with 
the loss of E-cadherin expression leading to EMT induction 
[74]  via  induction  of  Slug  [79].  Inhibition  of  TM4SF5- 
mediated  signaling  events  of  the  cytosolic  enrichment  of 
p27Kip1 abolishes abnormal multilayer cell growth [74] and 
retards the G1 to S phase progression [80]. Further, inhi-
bition of TM4SF5-mediated EMT by suppression of cytosolic 
p27Kip1 expression leads gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells to 
become  gefitinib-sensitive  [78].  TM4SF5  is  involved  in 
activation of hepatic stellate cells by causing EMT processes, 
leading to a correlation with the development of liver fibrosis 
in CCl4-treated mouse models [81]. TM4SF5 expression is 
achieved  by  TGFβ1-mediated  Smad  actions  on  EGFR 

activation [73], such that the important roles of the multi-
functional  cytokine  TGFβ1  in  the  activation  of  hepatic 
stellate cells and the EMT are confirmed in a development of 
murine liver fibrosis. Since liver fibrosis can eventually lead 
to hepatocarcinoma at a high rate of over 70% [82], the roles 
of TM4SF5 in the development of both fibrosis and tumo-
rigenesis in the liver can be reasonable. 

Meanwhile,  TM4SF5  expression  enhances  directional 
migration  and  invasion  of  hepatocytes.  TM4SF5  in  hepa-
tocytes causes directional migration at an enhanced speed 
and  the  formation  of  more  invadosome-like  structures 
enriched with cortactin, actin, and actin-regulatory proteins, 
like  Arp2  and  WASP  [77].  TM4SF5-mediated  directional 
migration involves direct interaction and activation of FAK 
via the ICL domain of TM4SF5 and the F1 lobe of the FAK 
FERM  domain  [75].  Further,  TM4SF5-mediated  invasive 
ECM  degradation  requires  direct  interaction  between  the 
COOH-terminus of TM4SF5 and c-Src, which is linked to 
Tyr845  phosphorylation  of  EGFR  to  form  more  invasive 
protrusions  [76].  TM4SF5-mediated  multilayer  growth 
[74],  FAK  activity,  migration,  and  invasion  [75]  are 
abolished by an anti-TM4SF5 reagent, TSAHC (a synthetic 
compound), which appears to affect its N-glycosylation and 
at the same time block induction of the TM4SF5-dependent 
EMT  phenotype  and  multilayer  growth  [83].  Therefore, 
TM4SF5 also plays important roles in tumor initiation and 
progression, possibly being supported by an EMT process.

Other TM4SF5-mediated EMT-related biological 
processes

The EMT is well known to be related also to the develop-
ment  [84]  and  stemness  of  self-renewal  [9].  We  also 
observed that TM4SF5 can play roles in other EMT-mediated 
biological  processes,  like  development  of  muscles  and 
self-renewal  of  cancer  cells.  In  zebrafish,  suppression  of 
tm4sf5 results in abnormal development, with an aberrant 
trunk  and  morphology  of  muscle  fibers,  presumably  via 
alterations in the expression and localization of integrin α5, 
which is necessary for somite boundary maintenance (Choi 
YJ and Lee JW, in revision). In addition to liver fibrosis and 
tumorigenesis, therefore, TM4SF5 expression is importantly 
involved  in  the  development  of  zebrafish  muscles,  which 
might bemediated by EMT.

Presumably, these diverse cellular effects by TM4SF5 ex-
pression  might  be  possible  due  to  the  characteristics  of 
TM4SF5―similar to tetraspanins―which forms large pro-
tein  networks  via  heterophilic or  homophilic  interactions 
between tetraspanins, integrins, and growth factor recep-
tors. TM4SF5 is shown to bind integrin α2, β1 [70, 71], α5 
[72], EGFR [73], and interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) (Ryu J 
and Lee JW, in revision). Although its ligand has not been

identified, interaction(s) with (an)other membrane protein 
or receptor can recapitulate the ligand binding-based acti-
vation. Therefore, TM4SF5 can transduce signaling activities 
for  diverse  cellular  functions,  including  the  EMT  and 
different EMT-mediated phenotypes. Although diverse miRs 
are known to regulate the EMT [7], miRs targeting TM4SF5 
are being studied.

TM4SF5-mediated gene regulation

Comparison  of  protein  expression  patterns  between 
TM4SF5-null and -expressing cells shows a negative corre-
lation between TM4SF5 and cell-cell adhesion-related mole-
cules of epithelial markers, including E-cadherin [74], and a 
positive  correlation  between  TM4SF5  and  mesenchymal 
markers, including Slug [79], supporting TM4SF5- mediated 
EMT.  Reverse  transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction 
analyses of show that TM4SF5-mediated regulation of their 
expressions  occurs  at  the  transcriptional  level  (Lee  JW, 
unpublished  observation).  However,  the  signaling  path-
ways underlying this regulation have not been determined 
yet. 

In  addition,  TM4SF5  expression  also  correlates  with 
cytosolic  p27Kip1  [74].  Although  p27Kip1  in  the  nucleus  is 
inhibitory to cyclin-dependent kinases, suppressing the cell 
cycle and proliferation, its localization in the cytosol can lead 
to tumorigenic functions [85]. Cytosolic p27Kip1 has been 
reported in different clinical reports, where different cancer 
types show enriched cytosolic localization of p27Kip1 [86-88], 
suggesting that cytosolic p27Kip1 can be tumorigenic [89]. 
p27Kip1 can be phosphorylated by Akt, KIS, or JNK [90-92], 
resulting in translocalization and stabilization in the cytosol, 
where it binds to and inactivates RhoA GTPase, leading to 
alterations  in  actin  organization  and  motility  regulation 
[93].  TM4SF5  expression  also  causes  overexpression  of 
p27Kip1, although how it occurs is unknown; TM4SF5 causes 
Akt-mediated Ser10 phosphorylation of p27Kip1, leading to 
its  stabilization,  RhoA  activity  changes,  and  eventually 
morphological  elongation  for  the  EMT  and  contact  inhi-
bition loss [74]. JNK-mediated p27Kip1 phosphorylation in a 
TM4SF5-dependent manner also results in localization of 
p27Kip1 at cell-cell contacts [91], possibly leading to altered 
actin  organization  at  cell-cell  contacts.  In  addition,  inhi-
bition of the proteasome in terms of activity and subunit 
expression also depends on TM4SF5 expression, resulting in 
morphological  changes  and  the  EMT,  suggesting  another 
novel mechanism for TM4SF5-mediated EMT [79].

Meanwhile, TM4SF5 causes activation of the FAK/c-Src 
signaling  pathways,  leading  to  STAT3  phosphorylation  at 
Tyr705 for the induction and secretion of VEGF, which can 
stimulate  neighboring  endothelial  cells  for  enhanced  (tu-
mor)  angiogenesis  [72].  During  modeling  of  the  tumor

rigenesis and maintenance in addition to developmental processes.

microenvironment,  cancer  cells  overexpressing  TM4SF5 
appear to negatively regulate expression of the cytokine IL6, 
and exogenous IL6 treatment leads to less STAT3 signaling 
activation in TM4SF5-positive cancer cells (Ryu J and Lee JW, 
in revision); thus, TM4SF5-dependent suppression of IL6 
can be a strategy for TM4SF5-positive tumor cells to avoid 
pro-immunological actions by IL6 secreted by neighboring 
immune  cells.  As  for  invasion,  TM4SF5  expression  also 
increases the mRNA and protein levels of MMP2, in addition 
to its activity [77].

Therefore, TM4SF5 expression correlates with or plays 
important roles in tumorigenesis in different mechanisms, 
including induction of the EMT and gene regulation (Fig. 2). 

Concluding Remarks

Considering that such membrane proteins as TMPRSS4 or 
TM4SF5 may be important upstream regulators of the EMT 
and the invasiveness of cancer cells and because their ex-
pression differs substantially in normal and cancer tissues, 
targeting them could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the 
treatment of cancer metastasis. In the future, the functional 
involvement of TMPRSS4 and/or TM4SF5 in the initiation 
and  progression  of  tumors  needs  to  be  evaluated  using  
mouse  models.  Cancer-associated  mutations  and  single- 
nucleotide polymorphisms within TMPRSS4 or TM4SF5 also 
need to be analyzed in association with cancer risk.
