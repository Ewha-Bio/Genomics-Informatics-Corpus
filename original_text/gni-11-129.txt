Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is defined by a 20-mm Hg difference of systolic blood pressure (dtSBP) and/or a 10-mm Hg 
difference of diastolic blood pressure (dtDBP) between supine and standing, and OH is associated with a failure of the 
cardiovascular reflex to maintain blood pressure on standing from a supine position. To understand the underlying genetic 
factors for OH traits (OH, dtSBP, and dtDBP), genome-wide association studies (GWASs) using 333,651 single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) were conducted separately for two population-based cohorts, Ansung (n = 3,173) and Ansan (n = 
3,255). We identified 8 SNPs (5 SNPs for dtSBP and 3 SNPs for dtDBP) that were repeatedly associated in both the Ansung and 

Ansan cohorts and had p-values of ＜1 × 10-5 in the meta-analysis. Unfortunately, the SNPs of the OH case control GWAS did 

not pass our p-value criteria. Four of 8 SNPs were located in the intergenic region of chromosome 2, and the nearest gene 
(CTNNA2)  was  located  at  1  Mb  of  distance.  CTNNA2  is  a  linker  between  cadherin  adhesion  receptors  and  the  actin 
cytoskeleton and is essential for stabilizing dendritic spines in rodent hippocampal neurons. Although there is no report 
about the function in blood pressure regulation, hippocampal neurons interact primarily with the autonomic nervous system 
and might be related to OH. The remaining SNPs, rs7098785 of dtSBP trait and rs6892553, rs16887217, and rs4959677 of 
dtDBP trait were located in the PIK3AP1 intron, ACTBL2-3’ flanking, STAR intron, and intergenic region, respectively, but 
there was no clear functional link to blood pressure regulation.

Introduction

Orthostasis  causes  a  gravitational  shift  in  circulating 
blood from the intra-thoracic space to lower extremities and 
reduces venous return to the heart. This transient increase in 
sympathetic tone and decrease in parasympathetic tone and 
these  normal cardiovascular  reflexes  cause  an increase  in 
heart rate and vascular resistance, restoring normal blood 
pressure  (BP)  and  cardiac  output  [1].  Orthostatic  hypo-
tension (OH) is the failure of the cardiovascular reflexes to 
maintain BP on standing from a supine position [2]. The 
Malmö Preventive Project reported that individuals with OH 
had significantly increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 
1.4 to 1.6) [3]. 

OH has been defined by the international consensus as a 

decrease in systolic BP ≥ 20 mm Hg and/or a decrease in 
diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg within 3 mintues of standing [4]. 
The prevalence of OH varies from 5% to 30%, depending 
greatly  on  the  population  being  studied  [5-7].  Aging  is 
associated with a definite increase in the prevalence of OH 
and was reviewed in Benvenuto and Krakoff [2]. In addition 
to the aging effects, OH is more prevalent in hypertensive [8, 
9], neurological [10], and diabetic patients [11, 12]. The 
all-cause mortality rate was higher in patients with OH than 
in those without OH [6, 7]

We have been conducting an epidemiology study of OH as 
part  of  the  Korean  Genome  and  Epidemiology  Study 
(KoGES) and previously reported that middle-aged adults 
(40‒70  years),  enrolled  from  2001  to  2002,  had  a  12.3% 
overall  prevalence  of  OH  and  that  the  OH  frequency  in-

creased significantly with age, from 6.4% in those aged 40‒
44 years to 23.1% in those aged 65‒69 (p ＜ 0.001) [9]. In 
addition, the study confirmed the correlations between OH 
and  hypertension,  body  mass  index  (BMI),  and  type  2 
diabetes [9].

The genetic contribution to OH can be hypothesized that 
the frequency of OH in families with a history of essential 
hypertension is higher than in the general population [4]. A 
genetic association study was conducted by Luo et al. [13], 
and  they  identified  a  functional  variant  of  NEDD4L  (epi-
thelial sodium channel E3-ubiquitin ligase).

To  identify  genetic  factors  associated  with  OH  trait  in 
Koreans,  we  conducted  genome-wide  association  studies 
(GWASs) for OH case controls using genome-wide single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and also tested 
supine and standing BPs as quantitative traits. 

Methods
Study subjects

The  study  subjects  consisted  of  two  population-based 
cohorts, Ansung and Ansan, which have been conducted as 
part of the KoGES. The phenotype of the cohort population 
was  previously  described  [14].  Briefly,  the  subjects  came 
from the Ansung and Ansan cities, located in Gyeonggi-do 
province near Seoul, Korea. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants, and this research project was 
approved  by  the  institutional  review  board  in  the  Korea 
National Institute of Health (KNIH).

Subjects with genotype accuracies below 98% and high 
missing  genotype  call  rates  (≥4%),  high  heterozygosity 
(>30%),  or  inconsistency  in  sex  were  excluded  from 
subsequent  analyses.  Individuals  who  had  a  tumor  were 
excluded,  as  were  related  individuals  whose  estimated 
identity-by-state  values  were  high  (>0.80).  After  these 
quality control steps, 8,842 samples were selected.

Clinical characteristics

BP was measured 3 times in the supine position. Before 
the first measurement, participants rested for 5 minutes, and 
the 3 measurements were taken in one arm showing the 
higher BP at least 3 minutes apart. After the supine position 
measurement,  the  BP  was  measured  soon  after  standing. 
Two of 8,842 subjects did not undergo BP measurement in 
the standing posture. Also, 1,291 individuals who had been 
treated  with  anti-hypertensive  drug  therapy  and  1,114 
self-reported diabetic patients or diagnosed diabetic patients 
by KoGES were excluded. Ultimately, 3,255 individuals from 
Ansan and 3,173 individuals from Ansung were used for the 
GWASs.  Other  cardiovascular  risk factors,  such as  chole-
sterol level and fasting glucose level, were measured from 

blood samples after overnight fasting.

Study genotypes

The genotyping of the cohort population was previously 
described for the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) study 
[14]. Most DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral 
blood of participants and genotyped using the Affymetrix 
Genomewide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). The quality control steps of genotypes have 
been described elsewhere [14]. Briefly, the accuracy of the 
genotyping  was  determined  by  Bayesian  Robust  Linear 
Modeling using the Mahalanobis Distance (BRLMM) geno-
typing algorithm [15]. Consequently, 333,651 SNPs had a 
missing  genotype  call  rate  below  0.1,  a  minor  allele 
frequency (MAF) greater than 0.01, and no deviation from 
Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  (p  >  1  ×  10-6).  To 
examine  the  population  stratification,  multidimensional 
scaling  analysis  and  principal  component  analysis  were 
performed using 44,724 pruned SNP markers [14].

Statistical analysis

The orthostatic BP changes were calculated by deltaBP = 
mean  supine  position  BP  － standing  position  BP.  Delta 
systolic  blood  pressures  (dtSBP),  delta  diastolic  blood 
pressure (dtDBP), and OH cases (dtSBP ≥ 20 and/or dtDBP 
≥ 10 [16]) were analyzed by linear or logistic regression, 
controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, BMI, and systolic 
BP. Statistical analyses were performed using PLINK version 
1.07, using default options [17] and SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS 
Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA).  The  GWAS  were  conducted  for 
Ansan and Ansung separately. The Ansan GWAS and An-
sung replication study results were combined by inverse- 
variance meta-analysis method, assuming fixed effects, with 
Cochran’s  Q  test  used  to  assess  between-study  hetero-
geneity  [18].  The  selected  SNPs  had  a  common  MAF 
(>0.05) and the population heterogeneity (p > 0.05). The 
asymptotic HWE tests were conducted using PLINK, and all 
the reported p-values were two-sided.

Results
Clinical characteristics

Table 1 describes the clinical characteristics of OH case 
and control subjects in the Ansan and Ansung cohorts; 311 
participants  (7.6%)  and  496  participants  (14.3%)  were 
found to have OH in Ansan and Ansung, respectively. The 
gender  distributions  of  OH  differed  significantly  in  both 
cohorts, and more male OH in Ansung and less male OH in 
Ansan were observed. The age of OH in Ansung (58.8 ± 7.8 
years)  was  older  than  that  in  Ansan  (51.5  ±  8.3  years), 
reflecting the higher prevalence of OH in Ansung.

(A, D), delta diastolic blood pressure (B,

The BMI was significantly smaller in Ansung OH cases 
than controls, but it was not significant in Ansan. While the 
mean  supine  BP  was  significantly  higher  in  OH  than 
controls, the standing BP was significantly lower in OH than 
controls.

Genome-wide association studies

GWAS  were  conducted  for  each  cohort,  and  the  target 
phenotypes were dtSBP, dtDBP, and OH. The GWAS results 
of  each  cohort  were  combined  by  meta-analyses,  and 
quantile-quantile plots and Manhattan plots are depicted in 
Fig. 1.

All detected SNPs are described in Table 2. Five SNPs for 

dtSBP trait and three SNPs for dtDBP trait passed our criteria 
(replicated in both cohorts [Ansung and Ansan] and p ＜ 1 × 
10-5), but unfortunately, the SNPs of the OH case control 
GWAS did not pass our p-value criteria. Among the signi-
ficant SNPs, four SNPs (rs6736587, rs6756959, rs6715049, 
and rs17020502) were in the high linkage disequilibrium 
status (r2 > 0.9) and were including the most significant 
SNP,  rs6736587  (meta-analysis  p-value,  5.3  ×  10-8).  The 
region of four SNPs was located in the intergenic region of 
chromosome 2, and the nearest gene (CTNNA2) was located 
at 1 Mb of distance. The remaining SNPs revealed a sug-
gestive association (p ＜ 1 × 10-5) with dtSBP at rs7098785 
(PIK3AP1 intron) and with dtDBP at rs6892553, rs16887217,

and  rs4959677,  which  were  located  in  the  ACTBL2  3' 
flanking,  steroidogenic  acute  regulatory  protein  (STAR) 
intron,  and  intergenic  regions  (chromosome  6p  25.2), 
respectively.

Discussion

These normal baro-reflex responses cause an increase in 
heart rate and vascular resistance, restoring normal BP and 
cardiac output [1]. OH is the failure of the cardiovascular 
reflexes to maintain BP on standing from a supine position 
[2]. Also, the frequency of OH in families with a history of 
essential hypertension may be higher than in the general 
population [4]. Therefore, the identification of genetic factor 
for orthostasis will help us understand OH mechanisms.

The signal plot for the most significant SNP (rs6736587) 
is  depicted  in  Fig.  2;  the  region  was  intergenic  and  a 
functional gene was located 1 Mbp upstream. Interestingly, 
this region is known as the chromosome 2p12-11.2 deletion 
syndrome region, and several cases report mental or psy-
chomotor retardation [19, 20]. There was only one gene, 
CTNNA2 (or known as alpha-N-catenin), around ±1 Mbp. 
CTNNA2 is a linker between cadherin adhesion receptors 
and  the actin  cytoskeleton  and  is  essential  for stabilizing 
dendritic  spines  in  rodent  hippocampal  neurons  [21]. 
Although there is no report about function in BP regulation, 
hippocampal neurons interact primarily with the autonomic 
nervous system. Therefore, the CTNNA2 gene may function 
in orthostatic BP regulation. 

Among  the  other  SNPs,  rs7098785  was  located  in  the 
phosphoinositide-3-kinase  adaptor  protein  1  (PIK3AP1) 
gene.  PIK3AP1  is  involved  in  B-cell  development  [22]. 
Interestingly, in silico analyses by the UCSC genome browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/)  indicated  that  the  SNP  was 
located in a DNase I hypersensitive region and in the binding 
site  of  transcription  factors  (MEF2C,  BATF,  MEF2A). 
Therefore,  the  rs7098785  SNP  might  have  a  regulatory 
function of PIK3AP1 expression. 

The remaining three SNPs of dtDBP were located in the 
ACTBL2 (beta-actin like protein 2) 3' flanking region, STAR 
intron, and intergenic region (chromosome 6p 25.2). The 
ACTBL2 protein is involved in various types of cell motility 
[23],  and  STAR  is  involved  in  the  regulation  of  steroid 
hormone synthesis [24]. 

Our study was the first trial to identify genetic variants for 
orthostatic BP traits in Koreans. We hope that our finding 
could  help  us  understand  the  underlying  mechanism  of 
orthostatic BP changes and related diseases.
