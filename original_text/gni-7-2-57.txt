Abstract

Fibrinogen  alpha  chain  (FGA),  a  subunit  of  fibrinogen, 
might  be  a  potential  player  for  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
(T2DM),  since  the  plasma  levels  of  fibrinogen  is  known 
to  be  related  to  the  incidence  of  T2DM.  To  elucidate  the 
potential  role  of FGA  in  T2DM,  we  investigated  whether 
FGA  genetic  variations  are  relevant  in  T2DM  in  the 
Korean  population.  Seven  FGA  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNPs)  were  genotyped  in  Ansung  and 
Ansan  cohorts  (474  T2DM  subjects  and  470  normal 
controls)  in  Korea.  The  association  between  SNPs  and 
T2DM  was  determined  by  logistic  regression  analysis. 
Genetic  relevance  of  SNPs  to  T2DM-related  phenotypes 
was  investigated  by  multiple  linear  regression  analysis. 
Statistical  analysis  revealed  that  among  seven  FGA 
SNPs,  significant  associations  with  T2DM  were  ob-
served  in  FGA  rs2070011  (p=0.013-0.034,  OR=0.72∼
0.79),  rs6050  (p=0.026∼0.048,  OR=1.24∼1.37),  and 
rs2070022  (p=0.016∼0.039,  OR=0.70∼0.72).  Two  SNPs, 
rs2070011  and  rs6050,  also  showed  significant  associa-
tion  with  T2DM-related  phenotypes  such  as  triglyceride 
(p=0.005∼0.011  for  rs2070011  and  p=0.003∼0.008  for 
rs6050),  total  cholesterol  (p=0.01  for  rs2070011  and 
p=0.024  for  rs6050)  and  fasting  glucose  (p=0.035∼
0.036  for  rs2070011  and  p=0.048  for  rs6050)  in  470  nor-
mal  controls.  Our  association  study  implies  that  FGA 
might  be  an  important  genetic  factor  in  T2DM  patho-
genesis  in  the  Korean  population  by  affecting  plasma 
lipid  and  glucose  levels.

Introduction

inflammation 

The  etiology  and  pathogenesis  of  T2DM/insulin  resist-
ance  might  be  explained  by  activation  of  innate  immune 
system  or  chronic  subclinical 
(pickup, 
2006;  Xu  et al.,  2003)  as  demonstrated  from  a  large 
number  of  human  population  studies  (Pickup  &  Crook, 
1998;  Brimble,  2002).  In  addition,  tumor  necrosis  factor 
alpha  (TNF-α),  one  of  the  proinflammatory  cytokines, 
has  been  demonstrated  to  mediate  insulin  resistance 
from  many  rodent  model  studies  (Hotamisligil  et al., 
1993;  Hotamisligil  &  Spiegelman,  1994).  It  also    has 
been  known  that  the  significantly  increased  levels  of 
proinflammatory  cytokines  such  as  TNF-α and  inter-
leukin-6  (IL-6)  induce  acute-phase  proteins  by  the  liver 
(Spranger  et al.,  2003).  Elevated  levels  of  acute-phase 
proteins  have  been  detected 
in  T2DM  subjects 
(McMillan,  1989;  Jonsson  and  Wales,  1976).  These  find-
ings  imply  the  relation  of  acute-phase  proteins  to  T2DM 
through  the  action  of  proinflammatory  agents.  A  variety 
of  risk  factors  for  T2DM  development  including  age,  in-
activity,  obesity,  racial  group,  smoking,  psychological 
stress,  and  low  birth  weight  also  have  been  known  to 
be  associated  with  augmented  acute  phase  proteins 
(pickup,  2006). 
    Fibrinogen,  one  of  the  acute  phase  proteins,  has  been 
considered  as  a  marker  of  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD) 
since  it  is  the  principal  protein  of  blood  clotting  (Ernst 
&  Resch,  1993).  Some  reports  demonstrated  linking 
plasma  fibrinogen  concentration  to  not  only  CVD  but  al-
so  the  metabolic  syndrome,  namely  T2DM,  hyper-
triglyceridemia,  hypertension,  and  hyperinsulinemia 
(Ganda  &  Arkin,  1992;  Imperatore  et al.,  1998).  FGA  is

influence  plasma 

a  subunit  of  fibrinogen  with  two  other  components,  fibri-
nogen  beta  chain  (FGB)  and  fibrinogen  gamma  chain 
(FGG)  (Mosesson  et al.,  2001;  Redman  &  Xia,  2001). 
Two  sets  of  three  different  chains  are  linked  to  each 
other  by  disulfide  bonds  to  form  a  hexamer,  fibrinogen. 
It  is  possible  that  genetic  factors  of  one  subunit  of  fibri-
nogen 
fibrinogen  concentration 
(Hamsten  et al.,  1987).  Study  in  HepG2  cells  has  sug-
gested  that  overproduction  of  any  of  the  three  fibri-
nogen  subunits  results  in  higher  fibrinogen  secretion 
(Roy et al.,  1994).  Polymorphisms  in FGA  and FGB  have 
also  been  found  to  be  associated  with  plasma  levels  of 
fibrinogen,  suggesting  their  association  with  the  fibri-
nogen  increase  (Heinrich et al.,  1995).  Thus,  it  might  be 
possible  that  polymorphisms  in FGA  affect  the FGA  ex-
pression,  which  in  turn  causes  the  change  in  the  levels 
of  plasma  fibrinogen.  Considering  fibrinogen  as  one  of 
the  risk  factors  of  T2DM,  we  speculate  the  association 
between  the  genetic  variations  of  FGA  and  T2DM. 
    Few  studies  have  been  reported  so  far  to  find  the  role 
of  FGA  in  T2DM.  Furthermore,  the  association  of  FGA 
polymorphisms  with  T2DM  is  still  not  elucidated.  To 
gain  insight  into  the  genetic  relevance  of  polymorphisms 
in  the FGA  gene  to  the  development  of  T2DM,  we  geno-
typed  seven  tagging  FGA  SNPs  in  944  unrelated 
Koreans  (474  T2DM  subjects  and  470  normal  controls). 
Our  statistical  analyses  using  genotyped FGA  SNP  data 
demonstrate  that  three  SNPs  (rs2070011,  rs6050,  and 
rs2070022)  and  two  haplotypes  ('AATGC'  and  'GATAT') 
in  FGA  are  significantly  associated  with  T2DM.         

Methods

Identification of FGA SNPs  by  sequencing  analysis

We  sequenced  the  entire  exons  comprising  untranslated 
regions  (UTR),  up  to  several  hundred  base  pairs  of 
exon-intron  boundary  regions,  and  the  promoter  region 
(approximately  1.0  kb  upstream  from  the  transcriptional 
start  site)  of FGA  to  identify  genetic  variations  from  24 
unrelated  individuals  (including  12  men  and  12  women) 
in  Ansung  and  Ansan  cohorts.  The  information  of  the 
gene  and  genomic  DNA  sequence  of FGA  was  available 
from  GenBank  (http://www.ncbi/nlm.nih.gov/).  Prior  to 
sequencing,  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  was  per-
formed  to  amplify  targeted  regions  from  genomic  DNA 
of  24  immortalized  cell  lines  generated  from  unrelated 
Koreans. Primer3  program  (http://wwwgenome.  wi.mit.edu/ 
cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi)  was  used  to  design 
PCR  primers  (Rozen  &  Skaletsky,  2000).  PCR-amplified 
fragments  were  sequenced  according  to  the  manufactur-
er's  protocol  using  an  ABI  Prism  3730  sequencer 
(Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA).  FGA  SNPs 

were  identified  by  assembling  the  sequences  using 
PolyPhred  program  (http://www.droog.gs.wasington.edu/ 
PolyPhred.html)  (Nickerson  et al.,  1997).

Subjects

Ansung  and  Ansan  cohorts  initiated  from  2001  as  major 
projects  for  the  Korean  Health  and  Genome  Study 
(KHGS)  primarily  represent  a  rural  and  urban  commun-
ity,  respectively.  Individuals  who  had  lived  in  the  boun-
dary  of  the  survey  area  for  more  than  6  months  partici-
pated  in  either  cohort.  All  participants  were  40∼69 
years  old  and  were  mentally  and  physically  healthy. 
Cohort  surveys  were  accomplished  every  two  year  with 
participants’  consent.  From  the  baseline  survey,  2,239 
men  and  2,779  women  in  Ansung,  and  2,523  men  and 
2,497  women  in  Ansan  were  examined  in  the  cohorts. 
    In  this  study,  474  T2DM  subjects  were  selected  from 
the  baseline  participants  in  the  Ansung  and  Ansan  co-
horts  according  to  World  Health  Organization  criteria.  A 
total  of  470  participants  in  the  cohorts  who  had  no  his-
tory  of  diabetes,  no  first-degree  relatives  with  diabetes, 
fasting  plasma  glucose  level  less  than  126  mg/dl,  plas-
ma  glucose  level  120  min  after  glucose  ingestion 
(glucose  120)  less  than  140  mg/dl,  and  HbA1C  level  less 
than  5.8%  were  recruited  as  normal  control  subjects.  In 
addition,  normal  control  subjects  had  to  be  free  of  med-
ications  for  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  dyslipidemia.  All 
study  subjects  including  both  case  and  control  were  ≥
60  years  of  age.  The  clinical  characteristics  of  the  study 
subjects  are  shown  in  Table  1.  The  study  was  approved 
by  the  institutional  review  board  of  the  Korean  National 
Institute  of  Health.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from 
all  participants  in  the  cohorts.

Genotyping

Six  SNPs  and  1  mutation  identified  from  Korean  sub-
jects  were  genotyped  by  an  allelic  discrimination  assay 
using  the  TaqManTM  reaction  described  elsewhere  (Hurd 
et al.,  2000).  These  genetic  variations  for  genotyping  in-

Statistics

Each  SNP  genotyping  result  of  subjects  was  used  to 
examine  minor  allele  frequencies  and  heterozygosities  of 
the  study  population.  The  deviation  from  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium  of  a  given  SNP  in  the  population  was  de-
termined  by  the  chi-square  (χ2)  test.  Haplotype  blocks

based  on  a  linkage  disequilibrium  (D')  plot  of  FGA  in 
study  subjects  was  generated  by  using  HaploView  v3.2 
(http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview/)  (Barrett et al., 
2005).  Resulting  haplotypes  were  also 
inferred  by 
HaploView  analysis  for  given  FGA  SNPs.  The  associa-
tions  of  SNPs  or  haplotypes  with  T2DM  between  con-
trols  and  T2DM  patients  were  determined  by  logistic  re-
gression  analysis  while  controlling  for  age,  sex,  and 
body  mass  index  (BMI).  Linear  regression  analysis  while 
controlling  for  age,  sex,  and  BMI  was  performed  to  de-
termine  the  associations  between  SNPs  or  haplotypes 
and  T2DM-related  phenotypes  among  normal  control 
subjects.  General  statistical  analyses  were  carried  out 
by  using  the  SAS  statistical  software  package  (SAS 
Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA).  Statistical  significance 
was  determined  at  a  two-tailed  value  of  p＜0.05.

Korean  SNP  database

The Korean SNP database (http://www.ksnp.ngri.re.kr/SNP/in-
dex.jsp)  that  was  constructed  by  the  Center  for  Genome 
Sciences  (Korean  National  Institute  of  Health)  provides 
the  general  information  for  SNPs  described  in  this  study.

Results

We  identified  7  SNPs,  1  mutation,  1  insertion  and  1  STR 
marker of the FGA gene (Supplementary Fig. 1, http://www.ngri. 
re.kr/SNP/index.jsp)  by  sequencing FGA  genomic  region 
including  the  promoter  region,  all  exons,  untranslated  re-
gions,  and±several  hundred  base  pairs  of  exon-intron 
boundaries  in  24  unrelated  Korean  subjects.  Except 
SNP  rs2070014  which  is  in  complete  LD  with  SNP 
rs2070022  (r2=1),  6  SNPs  and  1  mutation  were  selected 
for  genotyping  from  944  subjects  to  identify FGA  SNPs 
associated  with  T2DM.  A  total  of  474  patients  and  470 
normal  control  subjects  who  were  ≥60  years  old  were 
recruited  for  genotyping  from  the  Ansung  and  Ansan  co-
horts  in  Korea.  The  clinical  parameters  of  the  study  sub-
jects  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Significant  differences 
in  T2DM  related  parameters  are  obvious  between  T2DM 
cases  and  normal  controls.  The  levels  of  plasma  glu-
cose,  plasma  insulin,  plasma  lipid,  HbA1C,  and  HOMA-IR 
of  the  T2DM  group  are  significantly  higher  than  those  of 
the  control  group.

    To  detect  the  association  between  5 FGA  SNPs  (plus

T2DM  were  well  reflected  into  haplotypes.  Indeed,  our 
logistic  analysis  demonstrated  the  risk  effect  of  H1 
('AATGC')  (p=0.028,  OR=1.24,  co-dominant  model)  and 
the  protective  effect  of  H3  ('GATAT')  (p=0.029,  OR=0.72, 
co-dominant  model)  on  T2DM. 
    Three  SNPs  (rs2070011,  rs6050,  and  rs2070022)  and 
two  haplotypes  (H1  and  H2)  that  are  associated  with 
T2DM  were  further  analyzed  to  detect  genetic  relevance 
between  these  polymorphisms  and  T2DM  risk  factors 
(such  phenotypes  related  to  obesity,  hypertension,  dysli-
pidemia,  and  insulin  resistance).  Multiple  linear  regression 
analyses  performed  in  normal  control  subjects  demon-
strated the significant associations of two SNPs (rs2070011 
and  rs6050)  and  one  haplotype  (H1)  with  T2DM-related 
phenotypes  such  as  triacylglyceride  (TG),  total  choles-
terol  (TCHOL),  and  fasting  glucose  (Table  4).  The  rela-
tion  of  these  phenotypes  to  two  SNPs  and  a  haplotype 
well  agree  with  the  association  between  these  poly-
morphisms  and  T2DM  (see  Discussion).  Taken  together, 
these  results  suggest  that FGA  polymorphisms  may  af-
fect  T2DM-related  phenotypes,  which  contributes  to  the 
pathogenesis  of  T2DM.

Discussion 

Fibrinogen  is  a  complex  protein  composed  of  three 
pairs  of  subunits  (FGA,  FGB,  and  FGG).  In  addition  to 
its  physiological  role  as  a  cofactor  for  platelet  ag-
gregation  and  a  precursor  of  fibrin,  fibrinogen  is  involved 
in  many  physiopathological  processes  such  as  in-
flammation,  atherogenesis,  and  thrombogenesis  (Kamath 
&  Lip,  2003).  Fibrinogen  is  known  as  a  positive  acute 
phase  protein  whose  plasma  concentrations  increase  in 
response  to  inflammation  and  has  been  broadly  re-
garded  as  a  marker  of  CVD  (Ernst  &  Resch,  1993).  A 
high  fibrinogen  concentration  has  been  reported  to  en-
hance  the  risk  of  CVD  in  diabetic  patients  (Kannel et al., 
1990).  In  addition,  several  epidemiological  studies  also 
have  provided  evidences  for  the  relation  between  plas-
ma  fibrinogen  levels  and  T2DM.  Indeed,  the  elevated 
level  of  fibrinogen  was  observed  in  T2DM  patients  (Dunn 
&  Ariens,  2004),  and  predicted  the  T2DM  development 
(Festa  et  al.,  2002).  Polymorphisms 
inducing  over-
production  of  any  of  the  three  fibrinogen  subunits  might 
influence  the  high  levels  of  plasma  fibrinogen,  which  in 
turn  develop  T2DM  (Hamsten  et al.,  1987;  Roy  et al., 
1994;  Heinrich et al.,  1995).  Thus,  subunits  of  fibrinogen 
might  be  potential  candidate  genes  of  T2DM.  In  case  of 

FGB,  a  polymorphism  of FGB  (−455G＞A)  has  been  re-

ported  to  be  associated  with  insulin  level  variation  by  in-
creasing  plasma  fibrinogen  levels  (Maumus et al.,  2007). 
    In  this  study,  we  tested  the  possible  association  be-
tween  T2DM  and FGA  SNPs  in  the  Ansung  and  Ansan 

cohorts  in  Korea.  Our  findings  demonstrated  that  minor 

alleles  of  rs2070011  (−58G)  and  rs2070022  (＋6892T) 

have  the  protective  effect  related  to  the  incident  of 
T2DM,  while  that  of  rs6050  (＋4133G)  show  the  risk  ef-
fect  (Table  3).  It  is  also  evident  that  individuals  who 
have  haplotype  H1  comprising  protective  alleles  of  three 
SNPs  (rs2070011,  rs2070022,  and  rs6050)  appeared  to 
be  protected  against  T2DM,  and  vice  versa  for  in-
dividuals  who  have  haplotype  H3  containing  risk  alleles 
of  these  SNPs  (Table  3).  Considering  the  relation  be-
tween  T2DM  and  plasma  fibrinogen  levels,  the  compar-
ison  of  the  plasma  fibrinogen  levels  between  each  allele 
of  SNPs  in  the  Ansung  and  Ansan  cohort  populations 
would  be  informative  to  understand  the  biochemical 
relevance  of FGA  polymorphisms  to  the  development  of 
T2DM. 
    In  the  previous  study,  epidemiological  data  and  in  vitro 

evidence have demonstrated that A allele of FGA −58A＞

G  polymorphism  (rs2070011)  in  the  promoter  region  was 
closely  related  to  elevated  plasma  fibrinogen  concen-
trations  in  Israeli  families  (Friedlander  et  al.,  2003). 
Therefore,  our  observation  showing  the  protective  effect 
of  rs2070011  G  allele  on  T2DM  might  be  explained  by 
the  reduced  plasma  fibrinogen  concentration,  which  re-

sulted  from  the  decreased  expression  of FGA  by −58G 

in  the  promoter  region.  Another  polymorphism  of  ＋
4133A＞G  (rs6050)  located  in  the  coding  region  resulted 
in  a  threonine  to  alanine  change  in  the  331st  amino  acid 
residue  of  FGA. 
In  Silico  analyses  using  SIFT 
(http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/  index.html)  (Pauline 
et al.,  2002)  and  Polyphen  (http://genetics.bwh.harvard. 
edu/pph/data/index.html)  (Ramensky  et al.,  2002)  have 
demonstrated  no  deleterious  effect  of  amino  acid 
change  generated  by  rs6050  on  the  function  of  FGA 
(data  not  shown),  suggesting  its  role  as  a  surrogate 
marker  in  the  detection  of  T2DM  association.  SNP  ＋
6892C＞T  (rs2070022)  of  FGA  is  in  3'UTR  region  on 
chromosome  4p28.    Thus,  it  is  likely  to  be  expected 
that  this  SNP  might  contribute  to  the  plasma  levels  of 
fibrinogen  by  means  of 
the  post-transcriptional 
regulation. 
    Several  conditions  such  as  obesity,  hypertension, 
dyslipidemia,  and  insulin  resistance  are  thought  to  be 
crucial  risk  factors  for  T2DM.  Therefore,  understanding 
the  genetic  relationship  between  FGA  and  those  con-
ditions  might  help  unravel  the  role  of  FGA  in  T2DM 
development.  We  analyzed  five FGA  SNPs  and  five  hap-
lotypes  from  470  normal  control  subjects  to  detect  their 
association  with  several  phenotypes  related  to  obesity, 
hypertension,  dyslipidemia,  and  insulin  resistance.  Overall 
results  of  multiple  linear  regression  analyses  controlling 
for  age,  sex,  and  BMI  as  covariates  are  summarized  in 
Supplementary  Tables  1  and  2  (http://www.kogo.or.kr). 

Two  FGA  SNPs  rs2070011  (−58A＞G)  and  rs6050  (＋

4133A＞G)  showed  the  significant  association  with  dys-
lipidemia-related  phenotypes  such  as  triglyceride  (TG) 
and  total  cholesterol  (TCHOL),  and  the  insulin  resist-
ance-related  phenotype  such  as  fasting  glucose  (Table 
4).  For  rs2070011,  the  decreased  levels  of  both  plasma 
lipids  and  glucose  were  significantly  related  to  the  pres-
ence  of  a  minor  G  allele.  This  result  is  well  consistent 
with  its  protective  effect  for  T2DM  (Table  3).  The  sig-
nificant  association  was  also  evident  between  the  in-
creased  levels  of  both  plasma  lipids  and  glucose  and  a 
homozygous  G  allele  of  rs6050,  supporting  its  suscep-
tible  effect  for  T2DM  (Table  3).  Haplotype  H1  (AATGC) 
containing  risk  alleles  for  T2DM  such  as  an  rs2070011 
A  allele  and  an  rs6050  G  allele  showed  the  significant 
association  with  the  increased  plasma  levels  of  TG, 
TCHOL,  and  fasting  glucose  (Table  4).  These  results  im-
ply  that  genetic  variations  occurred  in FGA  might  affect 
on  T2DM  development  via  modulating  plasma  concen-
tration  of  lipid  and  glucose.
    Correlations  between  the  levels  of  plasma  fibrinogen 
and  lipids  (such  as  cholesterol  and  TG)  have  been  dem-
onstrated  in  the  previous  reports.  In  a  study  of  older 
adults  from  the  Cardiovascular  Health  Study,  fibrinogen 
levels  were  associated  significantly  with  the  develop-
ment  of  high  cholesterol  levels  (Manolio et al.,  2004).  In 
a  population-  based  cohort  of  nondiabetic  healthy  men 
aged  38  to  50  years  followed  up  over  a  long  period,  fi-
brinogen  was  identified  as  one  of  the  risk  factors  for  the 
developing 
levels 
(Engstrom et al.,  2007).  These  findings  suggest  that  high 
cholesterol  and  TG  level  could  be  associated  with  plas-
ma  fibrinogen  levels.  In  addition,  the  positive  relation 
between  fibrinogen  levels  and  fasting  glucose  in  a  non-
diabetic  elderly  men  and  women  also  was  reported  pre-
viously  (Sakkinen  et al.,  2000). 
    Mechanisms  linking  fibrinogen  levels  to  the  develop-
ment  of  T2DM  are  still  elusive.  Considering  the  correla-
tion  between  plasma  fibrinogen  and  lipid  levels,  how-
ever,  it  might  be  speculated  that  elevated  fibrinogen 
concentration  along  with  dyslipidemic  and  hyperglycemic 
conditions  can  lead  to  an  insulin  resistant  state  through 
endothelial  dysfunction  and  vascular  damage  (Hsueh  et 
al.,  2004).  Furthermore,  joint  increase  in  non-esterified 
fatty  acids  and  fibrinogen  has  been  observed  in  a  num-
ber  of  clinical  and  experimental  conditions,  which  ac-
counts  for  the  relationship  of  fibrinogen  and  insulin  re-
sistance  (Landin  et al.,  1990).

Conclusion

In  this  study,  we  found  that  three  FGA  polymorphisms 
(rs2070011,  rs6050,  and  rs2070022)  and  two  haplotypes 

Genetic  Association  between  T2DM  and  FGA  SNPs    63

(H1  and  H3)  showed  the  significant  association  with 
T2DM  in  the  Korean  population.  The  results  from  multi-
ple  linear  regression  analyses  further  demonstrated  that 
these  genetic  variations  (especially  of  rs2070011,  rs6050, 
and  haplotype  H1)  were  significantly  associated  to 
T2DM-related  risk  factors  such  as  dyslipidemia  and  in-
sulin  resistance.  Combining  knowledge  from  previous 
findings,  our  results  suggest  that  FGA  polymorphisms 
might  play  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  en-
dothelial  dysfunction  to  generate  insulin  resistance  and 
then  ultimately  T2DM  by  inducing  the  increment  of  plas-
ma  fibrinogen  levels  along  with  increased  lipid  and  glu-
cose  levels.
