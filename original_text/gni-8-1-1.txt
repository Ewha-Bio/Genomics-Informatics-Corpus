Abstract

Serpin  peptidase  inhibitor,  Clade  B  (ovalbumin),  Member 
5  (SERPINB5),  also  known  as  maspin,  is  a  potent  tumor 
suppressor  gene.  It  has  correlations  with  many  tumor 
cells,  from  pancreas  cancer  to  breast  cancer,  so  it  is 
possible  that  it  may  also  affect  liver  cancer.  There  has 
also  been  a  report  that SERPINB12,  a  gene  placed  right 
next  to SERPINB5,  is  expressed  in  liver.  For  this  study, 
32  polymorphisms  were  identified  in  SERPINB5  by  di-
rect  DNA  sequencing,  and  11  of  them  were  selected  to 
be  tested  with  a  larger  scale  subjects.  The  association 
of  the  11 SERPINB5  polymorphisms  with  Hepatitis  B  vi-
rus  (HBV)  clearance,  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  oc-
currence  and  the  onset  age  of  HCC  were  analyzed. 
There  were  no  significant  associations  found  between 
11 SERPINB5  polymorphisms  and  HBV  clearance.  In  the 
case  of  HCC  occurrence,  one  of  the  haplotypes  (ht) 
showed  association  with  HCC  occurrence  (OR=2.26, 
p=0.005,  PCor=0.05),  albeit  with  a  low  statistical  power 
(40.8%)  and  haplotype  frequency  (0.052).  Further  study 
with  a  bigger  sample  size  will  be  needed  to  clearly  ver-
ify  the  association  between  ht5  and  HCC  occurrence.

Introduction

Hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  infection  is  one  of  the  more 
common  diseases  worldwide,  with  more  than  360  million 
chronic  carriers  (Kane,  1998).  It  particularly  affects  Asia,

Africa,  Southern  Europe  and  South  America  (Lin  &  Kao, 
2008),  and  South  Korea  is  no  exception  to  the  virus,  as 
it  is  an  endemic  area  of  the  Hepatitis  B  virus.  There  are 
several  directions  for  clinical  course  of  HBV  infection, 
from  spontaneous  recovery  to  chronic  infection,  which 
may  further  develop  to  liver  cirrhosis  and  hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  Age  at  infection  is  a  crucial  factor  on  clinical 
outcome.  Most  HBV  infection  occurs  at  birth  or  within 
5  years  after  the  birth,  and  they  also  become  chronic 
carriers.  HBV  causes  not  only  Hepatitis  B;  chronic  in-
fection  of  the  virus  could  also  lead  to  liver  cirrhosis  (LC) 
and  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC).  It  has  been  noted 
that  HBV  carriers  have  as  much  as  100  times  the  risk 
of  developing  HCC  than  non-carriers  (Koshy,  1998).
    Hepatocellular  carcinoma  is  a  primary  cancer  type  of 
liver.  HCC  usually  develops  after  HBV  infection  or  devel-
opment  of  LC  and  is  one  of  the  most  common  types  of 
tumors  worldwide.  It  generally  affects  men  more  than 
women,  and  the  age  of  onset  is  usually  between  30s  to 
50s  (Kumar  V,  2003).  Pathogenesis  of  HCC  is  similar  to 
other  types  of  cancers  in  that  HCC  develops  when  a 
mutation  occurs  at  cellular  machinery  which  results  in 
faster  replication  of  the  cell  and/or  nullification  of 
apoptosis.  Chronic  infection  of  Hepatitis  B  or  C  virus 
aids  the  development  of  HCC  because  the  viruses 
cause  the  immune  system  to  attack  the  body’s  own 
liver  cell.  This  cycle  of  constant  damaging  and  repair 
can 
in 
carcinogenesis.  Recently,  it  has  been  suggested  that 
genetic  polymorphisms  may  be  associated  with  the  risk 
of  HCC  (Chun et al.,  2009;  Kim et al.,  2006;  Oh et al., 
2008;  Park  et al.,  2006;  Park  et al.,  2007;  Shin  et al., 
2003;  Shin  et al.,  2007).
    SERPINB5  is  one  of  serpins  and  a  tumor  suppressor 
gene  (Sager  et al.,  1997),  also  commonly  known  as 
maspin.  Serpins  are  sets  of  proteins  that  are  able  to  in-
hibit  proteases  and  affect  proteolytic  cascades.  However, 
SERPINB5  is  a  special  case,  which  acts  as  a  tumor 
suppressor  gene  instead  of  affecting  protein  pathways. 
SERPINB5  has  previously  shown  the  ability  to  suppress 
tumor  cells  in  places  such  as  bones,  pancreas,  and 
esophagus  (Cai et al.,  2009;  Hall et al.,  2008;  Hong et 
al.,  2009).  From  these  findings,  it  can  be  inferred  that 
SERPINB5  has  a  potent  ability  to  suppress  tumor  cells. 
It  has  also  been  reported  that SERPINB12,  a  member  of 
SERPIN  family  and  a  gene  that  is  resided  right  next  to 
SERPINB5,  is  expressed  in  liver  (Askew  et al.,  2001). 
SEPRINB12  also  affects  many  tissues  of  body,  including

pancreas  and  bone  marrows,  which  are  same  parts  that 
are  affected  by SERPINB5.  Therefore,  we  can  also  infer 
that  SERPINB5  may  affect  liver  as  well.  As  mentioned 
above,  genetic  change  may  be  a  factor  of  HCC  carcino-
genesis,  so  we  hypothesized  that  genetic  polymor-
phisms  of SERPINB5  could  influence  HBV  clearance  or 
HCC  development  of  HBV  infected  patients.

Methods

Study  subjects

A  total  of  1,074  Korean  subjects  having  either  present 
or  past  evidence  of  HBV  infection  were  prospectively 
enrolled  from  the  outpatient  clinic  of  the  liver  unit  or 
from  the  Center  for  Health  Promotion  of  Seoul  National 
University  Hospital  between  January  2001  and  August 
2003.  Subjects  were  placed  in  two  different  groups  ac-
cording  to  serologic  markers:  the  chronic  carrier  (CC) 
group,  or  the  spontaneous  recovery  (SR)  group.  The  CC 
and  SR  cohorts  consisted  of  639  and  435  subjects,  re-
spectively  (Table  1).  The  diagnoses  of  the  CC  and  SR 
subjects  were  established  by  repeated  seropositivity  for 
Ⓡ
 
the  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)  (Enzygnost
HBsAg  5.0;  Dade  Behring,  Marburg,  Germany)  over  a 
Ⓡ
 
6-month  period,  and  for  both  anti-HBs  (Enzygnost
Anti-HBs  II;  Dade  Behring,  Marburg,  Germany)  and  an-
ti-HBc  (AB-Corek;  DiaSorin  s.r.l.,  Saluggia,  Italy)  of  the 
IgG  type  without  HBsAg,  respectively.  Asymptomatic 
HBV  carriers  were  also  included  in  CC  group.  These  pa-
tients  usually  have  inactive  liver  disease  on  liver  biopsy. 
However,  it  has  been  known  that  in  these  patients,  HBV 
continues  to  replicate,  albeit  very  low  levels,  some  pa-
tients  have  residual  liver  disease,  and  HCC  develop 
frequently.  We  excluded  subjects  who  were  positive  for 
anti-HBs  but  not  for  anti-HBc,  and  those  positive  for  an-

ti-HCV  or  anti-HIV  (GENEDIA
Ⓡ
3.2;  Dong-A  Pharma-
Corp.,  Yongin-shi,  Korea,  HCV
ceutical  Co.,  Seoul,  Korea).  The  patients  who  had  any 
other  types  of  liver  disease  such  as  autoimmune  hep-
atitis,  toxic  hepatitis,  primary  biliary  cirrhosis,  or  Budd- 
Chiari  syndrome  were  also  excluded.  No  patients  had  a 
previous  history  of  immunosuppression  or  anti-viral 
treatment.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  each 
patient,  and  the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Human 
Research  at  Seoul  National  University  Hospital  approved 
the  study  protocol.  The  clinical  parameters  are  summar-
ized  in  Table  1.

Sequence  analysis  of  the  human  SERPINB5

In  order  to  discover  genetic  variants,  we  have  se-
quenced  exons  and  their  flanking  regions,  including  the 
promoter  region  (1.4  kb)  in  24  Korean  unrelated  in-
dividual  DNA  samples  using  the  ABI  PRISM  3700  DNA 
analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA).  Primer 
sets  for  the  amplification  and  sequencing  analysis  of 
SERPINB5  were  designed  based  on  GenBank  se-
quences  (Ref.  Genome  seq.;  NC_000018.9).  Sequence 
analysis  was  carried  out  using  SeqMan

Ⓡ
  software.

Genotyping  with  fluorescence  polarization  de-
tection

For  genotyping  of  eleven  polymorphic  sites,  amplifying 
Ⓡ
  (An et 
primers  and  probes  were  designed  for  TaqMan
al.,  2002).  Primer  Express  (Applied  Biosystems)  was 
used  to  design  both  the  PCR  primers  and  the  MGB 
TaqMan  probes.  One  allelic  probe  was  labeled  with  the 
FAM  dye  and  the  other  with  the  fluorescent  VIC  dye. 
These  probes  are

centration  of  900  nM  and  TaqMan  MGB-probe  concen-
tration  of  200  nM.  The  reaction  was  performed  in  a 
384-well  format  in  a  total  reaction  volume  of  5  ul  using 
20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The  plate  was  then  placed  in 
a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9700,  Applied  Biosystems)  and 
heated  for  2  min  at  50oC  and  for  10  min  at  95oC,  fol-
lowed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  15  s  and  60oC  for  1 
min.  The  TaqMan  assay  plate  was  then  transferred  to  a 
Prism  7900HT  instrument  (Applied  Biosystems)  where 
the  fluorescence  intensity  of  each  well  was  read. 
Fluorescence  data  files  from  each  plate  were  analyzed 
by  automated  software  (SDS  2.1).  Primer  sequences  are

We  examined  Lewontin’s  D’  (|D’|)  and  LD  coefficient  r2 

loci 

between  all  pairs  of  biallelic 
(Hedrick,  1987). 
Haplotypes  of  each  individual  were  inferred  using  the  al-
gorithm  (PHASE)  developed  by  Stephens  et al.  (Ste-
phens et al.,  2001),  which  uses  a  Bayesian  approach  in-
corporating  a  priori  expectations  of  haplotypic  structure 
from  population  genetic  and  coalescent  theory.  Genetic 
effects  of  inferred  haplotypes  were  analyzed  in  the  same 
way  as  SNPs.  Logistic  regression  models  were  used  for 
calculating  odds  ratios  (95%  confidential  interval)  and 
corresponding  p-values  controlling  for  age  (continuous 
value)  and  sex  (male=0,  female=1)  as  covariates.  In  our 
analysis  of  HCC  occurrence,  LC  (LC=1,  no  LC=0)  and 
HBeAg  (negative=0,  blank=1,  positive=2)  were  also  used 
as  covariates.  Cox  models  were  used  for  calculating  rel-

general/daleN/SNPSpD/).  Statistical  power  is  calculated 
with  PGA  matlab  application  (Menashe  et al.,  2008). 
PGA  is  an  application  specifically  designed  to  calculate 
statistical  power  and  other  values  of  case-control  genet-
ic  association  studies.  For  the  present  study,  a  co-domi-
nant  (1df)  model  with  relative  risk  1.3,  disease  preva-
lence  value  7.1%  (Lee et al.,  1998;  Vildozola  Gonzales 
&  Salinas,  2009),  EDF  (Effective  Degree  of  Freedom)  2, 
and  alpha  error  level  5%  were  used  to  calculate  the 
statistical  power.

Results

There  were  32  observed  polymorphisms  in  SERPINB5, 
and  11  of  them  were  selected  to  be  genotyped  in  a 
larger  samples  (n=1,074)  based  on  their  minor  allele  fre-
quencies  (MAF),  linkage  disequilibriums  (LD),  and  loca-
tions.  The  SNPs  selected  are  rs62099999, rs55958273, 
rs17071138, rs57171297, rs3744940  in  promoter  region, 
rs2292294  in  Exon  3, rs12454742  in  Exon  5, rs2289520 
in  Exon  6,  and  rs1455556, rs1455555, rs11542560  in 
Exon  8  (Fig.  1A  and  Table  2).  Some  of  the  poly-
morphisms  located  in  exon  induced  amino  acid  change, 
and  they  were  rs2292294  (alanine  at  12  to  alanine), 
rs12454742  (proline  at  111  into  proline),  rs2289520 
(valine  at  187  into  leucine), rs1455556  (serine  at  298  into 
serine),  and  rs1455555  (valine  at  319  into  isoleucine) 
(Table  2).  MAFs  of  each  polymorphism  are  also  shown 
on  Fig.  1A  and  Table  2,  and  the  statistical  powers  for 

Fig.  1.  Gene  maps  and  haplotypes  of  the SERPINB5  Gene.  (A)  A  map  of SERPINB5  on  chromosome18q21.3.  Coding  exons,
UTR,  and  SNPs  are  shown.  Coding  exons  are  marked  by  shaded  blocks  while  UTRs  are  marked  by  white  blocks.  SNPs 
marked  with  asterisks  (*)  indicate  that  they  were  genotyped  in  the  larger  population.  (B)  Haplotypes  of  SERPINB5  in  the 
Korean  population.  Only  those  with  frequencies  over  0.05  are  shown.  (C)  LD  coefficients  (|D'|  and  r2)  among  selected  SNPs
based  on  the  genotypes  of  whole  study  subjects  in  this  study  (n=1,074).

each  polymorphism  are  shown  in  Table  3.  The  frequen-
cies  of  haplotypes  are  listed  in  Fig.  1B,  and  haplotype 
p-values  and  association  analyses  of  HBV  clearance 
and  HCC  occurrence  are  listed  in  Table  3.  There  were 
six  major  haplotypes  with  MAF  bigger  than  0.05,  which 
accounted  for  74.6%  of  total  distribution.  LDs  among 
the  polymorphisms  of  SERPINB5  are  listed  in  Fig.  1C.
    Association  analyses  results  of  SERPINB5  for  HBV 
clearance  are  shown  in  Table  3.  There  was  no  sig-
nificant  association  found  with  SNPs  and  haplotypes  in 
the  case  of  HBV  clearance  (p＞0.05).  The  results  for 
HCC  occurrence  initially  had  two  associations  found, 
with  the rs17071138  (p=0.05,  OR=0.58,  95%  CI  (0.34∼
0.99))  and  one  of  the  haplotypes,  SEPIRNB5  ht5 
([A-T-T-G-C-T-C-C-C-T-A-T])  (p=0.005,  OR=2.26,  95% 
CI  (1.28∼3.99)).  The  initial  association  disappeared  for 
rs17071138  when  the  p-value  was  adjusted  for  the  mul-
tiple  testing  (correction  value=9.997),  but  ht5  retained 
the  association  ever  after  the  correction  (PCor=0.05). 
However,  the  statistical  power  and  MAF  of ht5  was  low 
for  the  data  to  be  completely  trustworthy  (statistical 
power=40.8%,  MAF=0.052).
    To  analyze  the  role  of  SERPINB5  polymorphisms  in 
the  onset  age  of  HCC,  Cox  relative  hazards  analysis  for 
age  of  HCC  occurrence  was  run  for  CC  groups.  There 
were  no  significant  associations  observed  after  correc-
tion  for  the  multiple  testing  (Table  3).

Discussion

facts  about  SERPINB5,  which 

SERPINB5  has  been  associated  with  prostate  cancer, 
breast  cancer  (Shao  et al.,  2008),  pancreas  cancer 
(Kashima  et al.,  2008;  Maass  et al.,  2001)  and  various 
types  of  carcinomas  (Bal et al.,  2008;  Blandamura et al., 
2006;  Cai et al.,  2009).  Also, SERPINB12,  a  member  of 
SERPIN  family  and  a  gene  placed  next  to SERPINB5,  is 
expressed  in  liver,  among  various  parts  of  body  (Askew 
et al.,  2001).  The  gene  has  been  discovered  in  relatively 
recent  time  (Khalkhali-Ellis,  2006),  so  there  are  still  un-
that 
known 
SERPINB5  may  have  unidentified  function  and  effects 
helpful  for  human  population.  From  this  reasoning,  the 
gene  was  selected  to  examine  whether  it  has  relations 
with  HBV  and  HCC.
    Polymorphisms  of  SERPINB5  were  screened  and  11 
variants  were  selected  to  test  their  relations  with  HBV 
clearance  and  HCC  occurrence.  There  were  no  sig-
nificant  associations  found  between  HBV  clearance  and 
the  genetic  polymorphisms. SERPINB5  is  primarily  known 
as  a  tumor  suppressor  gene,  so  the  result  is  reasonable 
in  that  HBV  infection  is  just  a  precursor  of  HCC.  In  the 
case  of  HCC  occurrence  analysis, ht5  showed  some  re-
(p=0.005,  PCor=0.05, 
lations 

implies 

in  co-dominant  model 

OR=2.26,  95%  CI  (1.28∼3.99)).  By  looking  at  this  result 
only,  it  would  mean  that ht5  has  association  with  HCC 
occurrence.  However,  although  ht5  showed  association 
with  HCC  occurrence,  it  had  a  low  statistical  power 
(40.8%)  and  haplotype  frequency  (0.052),  meaning  the 
susceptible  population  was  of  a  small  size  and  unreli-
able.  Therefore,  it  is  still  unsure  whether ht5  really  had 
an  association  with  HCC  occurrence  or  was  just  a  false 
positive  association,  thus  the  association  may  need  to 
be  studied  again  in  the  future  with  bigger  sample  num-
ber,  preferably  with  a  higher  number  of  subjects  that  ex-
hibit ht5  haplotypes.  Although SEPRINB5  functions  as  a 
tumor  suppressor  gene  in  other  parts  of  body  as  men-
tioned  above,  association  analyses  show  that  it  does 
not  play  a  significant  role  in  the  case  of  HBV  clearance 
or  HCC  occurrence  overall,  at  least  in  the  genetic  poly-
morphisms  we  studied.
    In  summary,  11  SNPs  of SEPRINB5  that  were  tested 
did  not  have  any  significant  relations  with  HBV  clear-
ance.  In  the  case  of  HCC  occurrence,  one  of  the  hap-
lotypes, ht5  showed  a  minor  association  with  HCC  oc-
currence,  but  there  is  a  possibility  that  it  might  have 
shown  the  association  due  to  the  small  sample  size  and 
low  frequency  value.  Therefore,  this  may  need  to  be  fur-
ther  studied  in  the  future  with  a  bigger  number  of 
subjects.  SERPINB5  still  has  potential  to  be  a  tumor 
suppressor  gene  for  other  parts  of  the  body,  so  future 
research  may  focus  on  relations  between  SERPINB5 
and  other  types  of  cancers.  However,  it  seems  that 
SERPINB5  does  not  influence  development  of  HCC  or 
have  association  with  HBV  clearance,  at  least  in  the 
studied  genetic  polymorphisms,  although  this  does  not 
rule  out  SERPINB5  from  the  candidate  genes  of  HBV 
clearance  or  HCC  occurrence  altogether,  because  there 
are  still  many  unknown  aspects  of  genes,  and  many 
current  researches  are  focusing  on  those  aspects,  such 
as  copy  number  variations  and  methylations  of  DNA. 
Therefore,  it  is  premature  to  say  that  SERPINB5  does 
not  influence  HBV  clearance  or  HCC  occurrence  on  any 
level.
