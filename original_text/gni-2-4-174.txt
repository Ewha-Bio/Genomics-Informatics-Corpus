Abstract 
We developed various plasmid cloning vectors that are 
useful  in  the  construction  of  genomic  and  shotgun 
libraries.  Two  medium  copy  vectors,  pCUGiblu21 
(pCb21) and pAGiblu21  (pAb21), which are resistant to 
(CamR), 
kanamycin 
respectively,  are useful for cloning DNA inserts ranging 
from  5kb to  15kb. Two  high  copy vectors,  pCUGiblu31 
(pCb31)  and  pAGiblu31  (pAb31 ),  containing  KmR  and 
CamR,  respectively, are useful for DNA inserts less than 
5kb.  These  vectors  are  well  adapted  for  large-scale 
genome sequencing projects by providing choice of copy 
number and selectable marker.  The small vector size is 
another advantage of these vectors. All  vectors contain 
lacZa  including  multicloning  sites  that  originated  from 
pBiuscriptllsk- for  easy  cloning  and  sequencing.  Two 
medium  copy  vectors  contain  unique  and  rare  cutting 
Swal  (A TTT AAA T)  restriction  enzyme  sites  for  easy 
determination  of 
two 
combined  vectors,  pC21A31  and  pC31A21,  which  are 
combinations of (pCb21  + pAb31) and (pCb31 + pAb21 ), 
respectively.  These two vectors provide four choices of 
vectors such as KmR and medium, CamR and high, CamR 
and  medium,  and  KmR  and  high  copy  vectors  by 
restriction  enzyme  cutting,  dephosphorylation,  and  gel 
purification. These vectors were successfully applied to 
high throughput shotgun sequencing of rice, tomato, and 
brassica  BAC  clones.  With  an  example  of  extremely 

insert  size.  We  developed

defined peri-centromeric region, we suggest the utility of

sequence assembly of various shotgun  libraries.  There 
are two  approaches  in  sequencing  large genomes:  (1) 
whole-genome  shotgun  sequencing  (WGS)  and  (2) 
clone-based shotgun sequencing (CBS).  WGS requires 
whole  genome  libraries containing  various  insert  sizes 
such as 50 kb,  10 kb, and 3 kb (Venter eta/., 2001 ).  CBS 
involves  obtaining  a  collection  of  large-insert  clones, 
such as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, 
covering  a  genome  multiple  times.  The  large  insert 
clones  are  then  assembled  into  contigs,  reproducing 
each chromosome of the organism. The series of large 
insert clones covering the whole genome with a minimal 
overlap are then chosen for sequencing. This approach 
was  successfully  used  in  sequencing  the  Arabidopsis 
genome (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000) and  rice 
genome (Yu eta/., 2003). Complete sequence assembly 
of an individual BAC clone is dependent on production of 
a shotgun  library containing  equally distributed  clones. 
Whole  genome  sequencing  requires  each  shotgun 
libraries  of  thousands  of  individual  BAC  clone  on 
minimum tiled path. 

Many  high  copy  plasmid  vectors  such  as  the  pUC 
series (Yanisch-Perron eta/.,  1985) or pBiuscript series 
(Stratagene,  La Jolla,  CA) can  be used for construction 
of small  insert shotgun  libraries  having  less than  5  kb 
inserts.  Lambda,  cosmid  or  fosmid  (Sambrook  et a/., 
1989), bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (Shizuya et 
a/.,  1992)  or  P1-derived  artificial  chromosome  (PAC) 
(Ioannou  eta/.  1994),  and  yeast artificial  chromosome 
(Y AC) (Burke, 1991) vectors carry up to 20 kb, 50 kb, 150 
kb, and 500 kb insert DNA, respectively. Tao and Zhang 
(1998)  demonstrate  that  some  plasmid  vectors  can 
maintain  up  to  300  kb  insert.  The medium  copy vector 
pBR322  was  used  for  the  whole genome  1 0  kb  insert 
library produced for whole genome shotgun sequencing 
of the  human  genome  (Venter eta/.,  2001).  However, 
there  is  little  information  about  the  vector  used  for

construction  of these  libraries.  Most  high  copy vectors 
confer ampicillin  resistance  by expression  of the  beta(cid:173)
lactamase gene. Because ampicillin resistance is due to 
the  extracellular  degradation  of  ampicillin  by  beta(cid:173)
lactamase,  satellite  colonies  lacking  the  beta-lactamase 
gene often are present surrounding resistant clones. The 
appearance of satellite clones can be reduced by growth 
on  high  concentrations of carbenicillin.  However,  it still 
remains an obstacle for large-scale and high throughput 
process.  Therefore,  we  developed  high  and  medium 
copy vectors  containing  the  stable antibiotic selectable 
markers,  kanamycin  or  chloramphenicol.  This  study 
provides a convenient choice of vectors based  on  copy 
number  or  antibiotics  resistance  for  construction  of 
genomic or shotgun libraries. 

Materials and Methods 
Vector construdion 
Vectors were developed by recombination  of functional 
DNA 
fragments  obtained  by  PCR  amplification. 
Commercially  available  plasmid  vectors,  pBR322 
(Amersham Bioscience), pUC18 (Amersham Bioscience), 
pBiuescriptllsk(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and pACYC177 
(GenBank accession no. X06402) and Entranceposon-Cam 
of template generation  system  (Finnzyme Co.  Finland) 
were  used  as  PCR templates.  Oligonucleotide  primers 

were  synthesized  by  MWG- iotech  (http://www.mwg(cid:173)
iotech.com/).  PCR  was  performed  with  Pfu  DNA 
polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers 
and templates in Table 1. The modeling of new vectors 
and  designing  of  primers  was  performed  using  vector 
NTI software (Invitrogen). Some PCR fragments (labeled 
as--p in Table 2) IN8re phosphorylated using T 4 polynudeotide 
kinase  (Promega,  Madison,  WI)  and  gel  purified  using 
Qiaex DNA fragment purification  kit.  The same amount 
of  the  purified  DNAs  were  combined  such  as  the 
combinations in Table 2 using T4 DNA ligase (Promega, 
Madison,  WI)  for  the  new  vector  construction  and 
transformed  into  DH10B  T1-resistant  competent  cells 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 

Genomic and Shotgun library construdion 
Large  amounts  of  plasmid  DNA  were  prepared  using 
Qiagen  plasmid  midi  kit  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA).  The 
dephosphorylated 
linearized  plasmid  vector  was 
prepared as described by Kim eta/. (2004) and Yang et 
a/.  (2003).  The  vectors  were  tested  for construction  of 
tens  of  genomic  and  shotgun  libraries  using  various 
insert DNAs, such as randomly hydrosheared or restriction 
enzyme  digested  10  kb  rice  nuclei  DNA  (Yang  et a/., 
2003)  or  hydro  sheared  BAC  shotgun  DNAs  ranging 
from 300 bp to 10 kb.

Sequence of the vectors 
Orientation  and  cloning  sites  of  the  vectors  were 
evaluated by restriction digestion with several enzymes. 
Complete sequences of the vectors were obtained using 
24  transpositioned  clones  of  each  vector  (template 
generation  system;  Finnzyme,  Finland)  and  additional 
reactions for finishing such as Yang eta/. (2003). 

Results and Discussion 
Construction of vectors 
Seven vectors summarized in Table 2 were constructed 
via  in  vitro combination  of various  PCR fragments with 
in  Table  1.  Two  vectors, 
the  functions  presented 
pCUGI11  and  pCUGI21,  were  developed  for  direct 
cloning  methods  such  as  the  double  adaptor  method 
(Andersson  et  a/.,  1996)  which  does  not  require  the 
blue/white  screening  because  there  is  no  lacZa  gene. 
The  pCUGiblu11  contains  p15A  origin  of  replication, 
which is an intermediate copy (around 10 copies per cell) 
and compatible with pMB1  origin of replication.  Nakano 
et  a/.  (1995)  constructed  several  intermediate  copy 
number vectors  containing  p15A ori.  However,  we  did 
not  used  the  pCUGiblu11 
for  library  construction 
because the yield of plasmid is not quite enough for high 
throughput  sequencing.  Thus, 
four  vectors  were 
selected:  pCUGiblu21  (pCb21),  pCUGiblu31  (pCb31), 
pAGiblu21  (pAb21), and pAGiblu31  (pAb31)forthefinal 
practical  use  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  origins  of PCR 
fragments were shown as a gray,  dot,  and white in the 
vector  maps  (Fig.  1 ).  The  gray  regions  represent  the 
selectable markers, KmR or CamR, which originated from 
pACYC177 or transposon DNA harboring CamR (template 
generation  system  of  Finnzyme),  respectively.  The 
dotted  regions  in  high copy vectors are originated from 
pBiuescriptllsk(-) and  the white region  in  medium copy 
vectors are originated from the pBR322.  The high copy 
vectors were combined with two PCR fragments, ori and 
lacZ including multicloning sites (dotted) and selectable 

markers  (gray)  (Fig.  1,  top  left).  Medium  copy  vectors 
were  combined  with  three  PCR fragments  such  as  ori 
(white),  /acZ  including  multi  cloning  sites  (dotted),  and 
antibiotics resistance (gray) (Fig.  1, top right). 

Combined vector 
Two vectors were combined based on copy number and 
selectable  markers  (Fig.1,  bottom)  to  improve  the 
convenience  of  vector  preparation.  The  pC21A31 
plasmid was constructed by combining pCb21, KmR and 
medium copy plasmid, and pAb31, CamR and high copy 
plasmid. Both are digested with BamHI and ligated each 
other (Fig.  1).  The  pC31A21  is  obtained  by  combinin~ 
pCb31  (KmR and high copy plasmid) and pAb21  (Cam 
and medium copy plasmid). The individual vector can be 
recovered  by  digesting  with  a  restriction  enzyme  as

Fig.  2.  The  combined  vectors,  pC21A31  and  pC31A21.  Two 
vectors were digested with EccR..V (E), cohesive ending Bam-11 
(B),  or Hi!Xllll  (H).  The digestion with  the blunt end  restriction 
enzyme  EccRV  or  the  cohesive  end  Bam-11  provides  two 
independent vectors,  one  medium  copy  vector (upper  band) 
and one  high copy vector (lower band).  These two combined 
vectors provide four choices of linearized ready-to-use vectors 
by ~estri~tion cutting and subsequent dephosphrylation and gel 
punficat1on.  The  pC21A31  provide  pCb21,  the  KmR  and 
medium copy vector,  (upper band) and pAb31, the CamR  and 
high co~y vector,  (lower band).  The pC31A21  provide pCb31, 
the  ~m  and  high  copy  vector  (lower  band)  and  pAb21,  the 
Cam  and medium copy vector (upper band). The DNA marker 
(m) is the 1 kb ladder. 

shown  in  Fig.  2.  Two  different  linearized  ready-to-use 
vectors,  one medium and one high  copy vector,  can  be 
prepared by enzyme digestion of a combined vector and 
subsequent dephosphorylation and gel purification. 

The utility of the vectors 
For the choice of copy numbers, three vector classes are 
available:  intermediate  (pCb11 ),  medium  (pCb21  and 
pAb21),  and  high  copy vectors  (pCb31  and  pAb31) for 
10,  25,  and  500  copies  per  cell,  respectively.  For the 
choice of selectable markers,  two antibiotics resistance 
genes,  KmR and CamR,  are available with different copy 
numbers. The pCUGI  series such as pCb11  (low copy), 
pCb21  (medium  copy),  and  pCb31  (high  copy)  contain 
KmR and the pAGI series such as pAb21  (medium copy) 
and pAb31  (high copy) contain CamR. 

The  high  copy vectors are useful for construction of 
shotgun library harboring insert DNA less than 5 kb. The 
medium copy vectors can be used for the construction of 
libraries containing medium size inserts ranging 5 kb up 
to 15 kb.  Two medium copy vectors,  pCb21  and  pAb21, 
were successfully used to construct rice whole genomic 
libraries  covering  8.8x  rice  genome  with  an  average 
insert size of 11  kb (Yang eta/., 2003) and 10 kb shotgun 
libraries (carrying inserts ranging 6 kb to 10 kb) from rice 
and tomato BAC DNA 

The vectors are well adapted for large-scale genome 
sequencing  projects  by  providing  a  choice  of  copy 
number and selectable marker for use in construction of 

Fig.  3.  The  shotgun 
libraries  constructed  using  different 
vectors,  pCb31,  pAb31,  and  pCb21.  (A)  Two  small  insert 
libraries in two high copy vectors were digested with Pvu/1.  The 
pCb31  shows  a  single1955bp  vector  band  and  the  pAb31 
shows  two  vector  bands:  1013  bp  and  813  bp.  The  various 
sizes  of inserts contain  448bp of vector DNA.  (B)  One  10 kb 
library using the pCb21, a medium copy vector, shows a 2379 
bp vector and  various  sizes  (up to  15 kb)  of inserts  by  Swal 
digestion. The  Swal  digested inserts contain 690 bp of vector 
sequence. DNA markers, m and M, represent 1 kb ladder and 5 
kb  ladder, respectively. 

whole genome or BAC shotgun libraries. The vectors are 
also successfully used for other cloning purpose such as 
cloning  of PCR fragments or construction of the shuttle 
library  suggested  by  McMurray  et  a/.  (1998).  PCR 
fragments  are  easily  cloned  into  the  vectors  after 
amplification  with  proofreading  Pfu  polymerase  and 
phosphorylation. 

For the reliable and convenient insert size evaluation, 
two  unique  and  rare  cutting  Swal  sites  (A TTT AAA T) 
were added, providing a convenient way to evaluate rice 
whole genome  10  kb  libraries  (Yang  eta/.,  2003).  The 
Swal  sites  are  highly  valuable  for  characterization  of 
genome  library from  GC  rich  prokaryote  genome.  The 
Pvull  sites  occurring  two  and  three  times  in  high  copy 
vectors,  pCb31  and  pAb31,  respectively,  were  applied 
for insert evaluation without ambiguity such as in Fig. 3A. 
The vectors have the following  useful properties:  (1) 
Relatively  small  size  compared 
to  commercially 
available vectors;  (2) Choice of copy numbers based on 
insert  size;  (3)  Choice  of  antibiotics  based  on  insert 
properties;

restriction  enzyme  sites  (Swal  and  Pvull)  for  the 
convenient  insert size evaluation;  and,  (6)  Multicloning

with universal primers. 

Improvement  of  shotgun  sequence  assembly 
using various insert size libraries 
We  have  successfully  used  each  vector  for  shotgun 
sequencing of tens of BAC clones from rice, tomato, and 
brassica; two high copy vectors, pCb31  and pAb31, for 3 
kb  insert  library  construction  and  two  medium  copy 
vectors,  pCb21  and  pAb21,  for  10  kb  insert  library 
construction.  The sequence  assembly  of a  BAC clone 
relies on sequencing of a randomly sheared 3kb library 
(Bouck eta/., 1998). It is suggested that using two kinds 
of shotgun libraries (such as a 10 kb and a 3 kb shotgun 
library)  improves  the  sequence  assembly  of  a  BAC 
clone, especially in the finishing phase (Kim eta/., 2004 ). 
We found an extreme example of bias in a hydro sheared 
small insert library in a specific BAC clone among tens of

Fig.  4.  An  example  of  a BAC  shotgun  sequence  assembly 
using  two  different  shotgun  libraries,  3 kb  library  and  10  kb 
library. Tomato BAC clone LeH121H12 was determined to be 
151758  bp  (phred  value  >  3.0)  after  complete  sequence 
assembly  and 
finishing.  The  nucleotide  positions  were 
represented in the gray box of (D) which  is imported from the 
window of a program 'phrapview'. The GC composition (A) and 
AT  rich 
low  complexity  regions  (B)  are  presented  as 
percentage in every 50 bp window and black lines, respectively. 
The  shotgun  clones  are  represented  as  red  and  pink  lines 
based  on  their forward  and  reverse  sequence  positions  and 
directions.  The  pink lines represent overlaps of clones  at the 
same  positions  (C,  D).  The  random  sheared  776  shotgun 
clones (eight 96 plates) of 3 kb library representing 6x converge 
are extremely biased and represented  less than  50% of BAC 
sequence (C). The 384 clones (four 96 plates) from the Haelll 
partial  digested  10  kb  library  (3x  coverage)  were  evenly 
dispersed through the entire region and cover the entire BAC 
sequence. The 3 kb and  10 kb libraries are cloned into a high 
copy  vector  (pCb31)  and  a  medium  copy  vector  (pCb21), 
respectively. 

BAC clones tested. A hydro sheared 3 kb shotgun library 
of tomato  BAC  clone,  Le121H12,  showed  an  extreme 
bias after assembly of more than 6x coverage of shotgun 
clones  as  shown  in  Fig.  4C.  The  3  kb  shotgun  library 
does not cover more than 50% of BAC DNA sequence, 
demonstrating that there is no way to finish the complete 
sequence  of the  BAC  clone  if only  the  3  kb  shotgun 
library is used. On the other hand, 3x coverage of 10 kb 
clones  harboring  Haelll  partial  digested  inserts  are 
distributed  randomly  throughout  the  entire  BAC  clone 
(Fig. 4D). The complete 152 kb sequence was obtained 
by  subsequent  sequencing  of  bridging  1 0  kb  clones 
spanning  sequence  gaps  after sequence  assembly  of 
two libraries. The bridging  10 kb clones are completely 
sequenced using transposon insertion method (Biery et 
a/.,  2000;  Devine  et a/.,  1997;  Yang  et a/.,  2003)  or 
partially sequenced  by primer walking.  The BAC clone 
was  originated 
from  a  cytogenetically  defined 
centromeric  region  (Budiman  eta/.,  2004;  Yang  eta/., 
Manuscipt  in  preparation).  It  is  hypothesized  that  the 
bias  of 3  kb  shotgun  library  was  due  to  the  unequal 
distribution of AT rich,  low complexity regions (such as 
shown  in  Fig.  4B)  resulting  in  uneven  mechanical 
breakdown  of the  BAC  DNA  in  the  process  of  hydro 
shearing.
