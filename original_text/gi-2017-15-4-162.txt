Metal binding proteins or metallo-proteins are important for the stability of the protein and also serve as co-factors in various 
functions like controlling metabolism, regulating signal transport, and metal homeostasis. In structural genomics, prediction 
of metal binding proteins help in the selection of suitable growth medium for overexpression’s studies and also help in 
obtaining  the  functional  protein.  Computational  prediction  using  machine  learning  approach  has  been  widely  used  in 
various fields of bioinformatics based on the fact all the information contains in amino acid sequence. In this study, random 
forest machine learning prediction systems were deployed with simplified amino acid for prediction of individual major metal 
ion binding sites like copper, calcium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc.

Introduction

Amino acids play a central role in the building block of 
protein. The primary structure of the protein is determined 
by the arrangement of 20 naturally occurring amino acids. 
The function of a protein is determined from their amino 
acids and also they depend upon interaction with cofactors, 
binding with metal ions and interaction with other proteins. 
The proteome of all the organism share significant metal 
ions and metal binding cofactors to carry out its essential 
function. It has been estimated that approximately 30% of all 
proteins contain at least one metal. The proteins play a vital 
role in biological processes and in the stability of the protein 
by binding with metal ions or metal containing-cofactors [1]. 
The  proteins  bind  with  major  metal  ions  like  transition 
metals, alkali, and alkaline metals. The frequent metal ions 
that bind with proteins are sodium, copper, iron, magne-
sium, manganese, potassium, and zinc ions respectively. In 
in-vitro  condition,  the  unfolded  polypeptide  may  are 
observed  to  interact  with  metal  ions  that  direct  the 
polypeptide  folding  process  [2].  Identification  of  metal 

binding  through  experimental  procedures  like  the  use  of 
metal 
ion  affinity  column  chromatography  [3,  4], 
electrophoretic  mobility  shift  assay  [5,  6],  absorbance 
spectroscopy [7], gel electrophoresis [8], nuclear magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy [9-11], and mass spectrometry [3, 
12] require tedious steps and specific instruments, making 
them expensive and may be unsuitable for unknown targets. 
In this aspect, there is a need for computational predictors of 
protein binding metal ion in order to reduce time and cost. 
For example, predictions of protein metal binding ions are 
useful  in  structural  genomics,  to  select  proper  growth 
medium  for  overexpression  studies  and  for  the  easy 
interpretation  of  electron  density  maps.  But  fortunately, 
metal-binding  ability  are  encoded  in  the  amino  acidic 
sequences  and  these  primary  sequences  help  in  protein 
structure  formation.  Through  genomic  projects  various 
organism  genomic  sequences  have  been  annotated 
somehow along with metalloproteins contained in them [1]. 
Bioinformatics  has  been  extensively  used  to  predict 
metal-binding ability from amino acid sequences. Various 
computational methods like artificial neural networks [13], 
support vector machines [14], decision tree algorithm [15],

graph theory [16], FoldX force field [17], CHED [18, 19], 
and  geometry  algorithm  methods  [16].  These  methods 
depend upon either only sequence information or the use of 
both sequence and structure information. However, most of 
the  available  prediction  methods  are  either  based  on  the 
knowledge of the apoprotein structure or restricted to few 
specific cases, like the metal binding of histidines/cysteines. 
Most  of  these  methods  have  been  implemented  as  stan-
dalone software or web servers to the research community 
[15, 20]. 

Due  to  the  availability  of  cheap  and  advancement  of 
sequencing  instruments,  the  sequence  of  proteins  has 
increased rapidly over when compared to protein structure 
data. This due to the fact that experimental determining the 
three-dimensional  of  protein  is  difficult  and  expensive. 
Through various theoretical and experimental studies, it is 
proved that minimal set of the amino acid is sufficient for 
protein  folding  [21].  The  minimal  set  of  representative 
residues with similar features can be achieved by grouping 
together the 20 amino acids by clustering. This method is 
called as reduced or simplified amino acid alphabet. Several 
simplified amino acid alphabets have been proposed, which 
have  been  applied  to  pattern  recognition  method  in  the 
prediction  of  protein  structure  [22],  for  generation  of 
consensus  sequences  from  multiple  alignments,  and  for 
protein  folding  prediction  [23].  Various  computational 
predictor  has  used  simplified  amino  acids  to  predict  the 
solubility  on  overexpression,  remote  homology  detection 
[19], and identify the defensin peptide family [24], effects of 
cofactors  on  conformation  transition  [25],  DNA-binding 
proteins [26], heat shock protein families [27], inter-residue 
interaction [28], protein adaptation to mutation [29], and 
protein disorder [30]. In the present study, a random forest 
algorithm has been deployed to predict metal ion binding 
protein based on the simplified amino acids proposed by 
Murphy et al. [21].

Methods
Dataset construction

All  the  protein  sequences  were  downloaded  from  the 
UniProt database [31] available at http://www.uniprot.org/. 
The downloaded sequences, annotated as metal containing, 
were  grouped  into  eight  subsets.  Each  of  the  subsets, 
containing  one  of  the  metal  species  viz.,  calcium,  cobalt, 
copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc was 
considered  to  be  metal-containing  while  all  other  entries 
were considered to be metal-free. Redundancy among the 
amino acid sequences was removed by clustering analysis 
using the cd-hit program [32] with the threshold of 50% 
level of percentage of identity, analogous by the UniRef 50 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  15,  No.  4,  2017

list [33] available in the UniProt database.

This  resulted  in  eight  data  sets  containing  186  calci-
um-containing proteins, 69 cobalt-containing proteins, 215 
copper-containing  proteins,  315  iron-containing  proteins, 
961 magnesium-containing proteins, 386 manganese-con-
taining proteins, 74 nickel-containing proteins, and 1,716 
zinc-containing  proteins. All  proteins  containing  calcium, 
cobalt, copper, magnesium, manganese, nickel, or zinc were 
then  subtracted  from  the  UniRef50  list,  resulting  in  a 
collection of non-metalloproteins. The workflow of dataset 
construction  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  problem  of  the  im-
balanced dataset can be solved as proposed by Cohen et al. 
[34]. Firstly, they pre-processes the data to re-establish class 
balance (either by upsizing the minority class or downsizing 
the  majority  class).  Secondly,  they  modify  the  learning 
algorithm itself to copy with imbalanced data. In this study, 
we pre-processed the data which contains a balanced set of 
metal and non-metal ions. For this construction, non‒me-
tallo-proteins datasets sequences were randomly selected in 
order to have balanced set of metal and non-metal binding 
proteins for each metal ion, respectively.

Feature extraction by simplified amino acid 
alphabets

In order to investigate the effect of a particular class of 
amino acids on metal ion binding, the 20 amino acids were 
grouped  into  various  classes  based  on  certain  common 
properties and the composition of the reduced sets of amino 
acids was considered. Feature extraction is done using the 
simplified amino acid alphabet. It estimates that reduced 
alphabets  containing  10‒12  letters  can  be  used  to  design 
foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. 
This estimate is based on the observation that there is little 
loss  of  the  information  necessary  to  pick  out  structural 
homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a 
suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 
letters is made.

S  Kumar.  Metal  Ion  Binding  Prediction  from  Protein  Sequence

A  simplified  amino  acid  alphabet  of  18  characters  was 
used (Table 1). It is based on three independent amino acid 
classifications. 

based  on  the  hydrophobicity  scale  which  consists  of  the 
following cluster: [CFILMVW], [AG], [PH], [EDRK], and 
[NQSTY].

Conformational similarity
Conformational similarity indices are proposed by Chak-
rabarti and Pal [28] based on different residues are computed 
using  the  distribution  of  the  main-chain  and  side-chain 
torsion angles and values have been used to cluster amino 
acids  in  proteins.  In  this  method,  the  conformational 
similarity of the 20 amino acids based on torsion angles, 
which contains seven clusters ([CMQLEKRA], [P], [ND], 
[G], [HWFY], [S], and [TIV]) are used to represent variables.

BLOSUM 50 substitution matrix
The  BLOSUM-50  matrix  is  proposed  by  Cannata  et  al. 
[35].  The  matrix  is  deduced  from  amino  acid  pair 
frequencies in aligned blocks of a protein sequence database 
and is widely used for sequence alignment and comparison. 
The BLOSUM 50 matrix that they group together on the 
basis of the possibility of foldable structures and consists of 
the clusters: [P], [KR], [EDNQ], [ST], [AG], [H], [CILMV], 
and [YWF].

Hydrophobicity 
The hydrophobicity scale by Rose et al. [36] is correlated 
to  the  average  area  of  buried  amino  acids  in  globular 
proteins. This results in a scale which is not showing the 
helices of a protein, but rather the surface accessibility. It is

Random forest predictions

Random forest is a classification algorithm [37] that uses 
an  ensemble  of  tree-structured  classifiers.  The  random 
forest is a popular algorithm that has been used in designing 
computational  predictors  for  various  biological  problems. 
Random forest is an ensemble learning method for classi-
fication. The random forest classifies a new object with an 
input vector, the input vector is predicted by each decision 
tree in the forest. Each tree provides a classification with 
votes and the class with most votes will be output as the 
predicted class. It is implemented by using Weka package 
[38, 39]. To ensure that parameter estimation and model 
generation of random forest is completely independent of 
the  test  data,  a  nested  cross-validation  procedure  is  per-
formed. Nested cross-validation [40] means that there is an 
outer  cross-validation  loop  for  model  assessment  and  an 
inner loop for model selection. In this study, the original 
samples are randomly divided into k = 10 parts in the outer 
loop.  Each  of  these  parts  is  chosen  one  by  one  for 
assessment, and the remaining nine of 10 samples are for 
model  selection  in  the  inner  loop  where  a  type  of 
cross-validation using the so-called out-of-bag samples is 
performed.

Measurement of classifier's performance

When  the  predictor  was  focused  on  the  problem  of 
distinguishing proteins containing a certain type of metal ion 
from proteins that do not contain any type of metal, it is 
important  that  both  sets  contain  the  same  number  of 
proteins; otherwise, several figures of merit that are com-
monly used to monitor the prediction reliability would be 
seriously  biased.  The  reliability  of  the  predictions  was 
monitored with the following quantities. If a protein of type 
1 must be distinguished from a protein of type 2, a prediction 
was considered to be a true-positive if type 1 was correctly 
predicted; it was considered to be a true-negative if type 2 
was  correctly  predicted;  it  was  considered  to  be  a 
false-negative if a type 1 protein was predicted to be a type 2 
protein; and it was considered to be a false-positive if a type 
2 protein was predicted to be a type 1 protein. Consequently, 
the following figures of merit, the sensitivity, the specificity, 
the accuracy, the Mathews correlation are computed [41] as 
shown in the Eq. (1) below.

Results and Discussion

By using a simplified amino acid alphabet based on three 
independent amino acid classifications, amino acid cluster 
variables were obtained. Conformational similarity contains 
seven  clusters:  [CMQLEKRA],  [P],  [ND],  [G],  [HWFY], 
[S], and [TIV]. BLOSUM 50 substitution matrix contain [P], 
[KR], [EDNQ], [ST], [AG], [H], [CILMV], and [YWF]. The 
hydrophobicity  scale  contains  [CFILMVW],  [AG],  [PH], 
[EDRK],  and  [NQSTY].  Out  of  20  amino  acid  clusters, 
cluster [P] and [AG] which are present in more than one 
simplified  alphabet  were  considered  only  once  and  these 
results  in  18  variables  (Table  1).  The  18  variables  are 
represented with percentage of occurrence as follows.

The percentage of occurrence pcaa,i of the amino acid aa in 
the ith protein was computed for each of the 20 types of amino 
acids in each protein as per Eq. (2). The protein sequences 
represented  by  the  amino  acid  percentage  of  occurrence 
using  18  variables  were  employed  with  random  forest 
algorithm  using  Weka  suite.  The  metallo-proteins  were 
identified  using  all  the  18  variables  with  high  accuracy 
ranging  from  69%  for  zinc  and  90%  for  nickel  (Table  2). 
Moreover,  prediction  performance  was  studied  by  feature 
selection method by removing one variable at a time and 
maintaining  the  highest  value  in  performance  indices. 
Measurements are removed until there is an unacceptable 
degradation  in  system  performance.  The  use  of  feature 
selection  method  will  eliminate  alphabets  which  are 
irrelevant or redundant features, and thus it improves the 
accuracy  of  the  learning  algorithm.  To  select  an  optimal 
subset  of  variables,  we  first  analyzed  how  individual 
attributes from the initial set of 18 variables, contributed to 
predictive accuracy. For feature selection, we employed the 
wrapper approach as it uses the learning algorithm to test all 
existing  feature  subsets.  The  wrapper  method  will  use  a 
subset  of  features  to  train  the  model.  Based  on  the 
inferences, the feature can be added or removed to improve 
the accuracy of the learning algorithm. We used a backward 
feature elimination, by starting with the full set and deleting 
attributes one at a time for searching the feature space [42, 
43]. 

The specific steps of the wrapper approach followed in this 

study.

(1) Partitioning the data with 10-fold cross-validation (k = 

10).

(2)  On  each  cross-validation  training  set,  the  learning 
machine was trained by using all 18 variables, to produce a 
ranking of the variables according to the importance. The 
cross-validation test set predictions were recorded.

(3)  Then  the  variables  are  removed  which  are  least

important one by  one and another learning  machine was 
trained based on remaining variables, the cross-validation 
test set predictions were once again recorded. This step is 
repeated by removing each variable until at small number 
remain. 

(4) Aggregate the predictions from all 10 cross-validation 
test sets and compute the aggregate accuracy at each step 
down in a number of variables.

By  the  following  the  above  steps,  feature  selection  of 
variables was done by wrapper approach employing random 
forest  machine  learning  algorithm.  Based  on  aggregate 
accuracy, the important variables for copper ion prediction 
are  PH  variable  and  least  preferred  variables  are  AG  and 

CMQLEKRA (Table 3). Based on Table 3, it is understood 
that  removing  PH  variable  decrease  the  accuracy  of  the 
classifier whereas removing AG and CMQLEKRA improves 
the accuracy of the classifier. For calcium ion prediction, the 
least  important  variable  is  P  and  EDNQ;  removing  these 
variable improves the performance of the classifier (Table 4). 
Similarly, for cobalt ion prediction, the variable CILMV is the 
least preferred variable as it affects the performance of the 
classifier  (Table  5).  For  iron  ion  prediction,  removing 
variable  CFILMVW  improves  the  performance  of  the 
classifier (Table 6). For magnesium, ion prediction variable 
ST  and  ND  are  least  preferred  variables  (Table  7).  For 
manganese ion prediction, removing variable FWY improves

the  accuracy  of  the  classifier  (Table  8).  For  nickel  ion 
prediction, variable EDRK is the least preferred one (Table 
9). For zinc ion prediction, the least preferred variable is 
HWFY (Table 10).

For  example,  cobalt  metal  binding  protein  can  be 

discriminated from non-metal ions with all 18 variables with 
the accuracy of 85% (Fig. 2). It can be seen that, on removing 
variable V14 (CILMV) from the subset, the accuracy of the 
predictor  improves  from  85%  to  87%.  After  removing  of 
variables  V8  (CFILMVW),  V3  (ND),  V17  (EDNQ),  V10

Fig.  2. The performance graph of the Random forest classifier using 
feature selection (10-fold cross validation for cobalt ion prediction).

(PH), and V16 (ST), the accuracy values are in the range 
from 86% to 87%. There is a drastic decrease in accuracy of 
the classifier by removing the variable V12 (NQSTY) to 84%. 
No  further  reduction  of  the  set  was  possible,  as  the 
performance  of  random  forest  classifier  dropped  if  any 
further  attributes  were  eliminated.  It  can  be  seen  that 
accuracy  of  prediction  of  metal  binding  proteins  can  be 
improved (e.g., calcium from 74% to 77%, cobalt from 83% 
to  85%,  and  nickel  from  69%  to  77%)  by  elimination  of 
certain  noisy  features,  up  to  certain  limit  and  further 
improvement  is  then  impossible.  According  to  this 
backward strategy of feature selection, it can be observed 
that the prediction performance can be slightly improved. 
Some  common  variables  rejected  are  V14  (CILMV)  in 
calcium and cobalt, V8 (CFILMVW) in copper and iron.

In  this  work,  a  new  random  forest  based  approach  is 
developed combining hybrid feature of simplified amino acid 
alphabets for prediction of metal ion binding sites of iron, 
copper manganese, magnesium, nickel, calcium, cobalt, and 
zinc from amino acid sequence data. The result indicates that 
the random forest model has a high prediction accuracy in 
predicting  metal  ion  binding  sites.  These  metal  binding 
prediction  methods  are  helpful  to  avoid  the  selection  of 
‘impossible’ targets in structural biology and proteomics.
