Abstract

Osteoporotic  fracture  (OF),  along  with  bone  mineral  den-
sity  (BMD),  is  an  important  diagnostic  parameter  and  a 
clinical  predictive  risk  factor  in  the  assessment  of  osteo-
porosis  in  the  elderly  population.  However,  a  genome- 
wide  association  study  (GWAS)  on  OF  has  not  yet  been 
clarified  sufficiently.  To  identify  OF-associated  genetic 
variants  and  candidate  genes,  we  conducted  a  GWAS  in 
a  population-based  cohort  (Korean  Association  Resource 
[KARE],  n=1,427  [case:  288  and  control:  1139])  and  per-
formed  a  de  novo  replication  study  in  hospital-based  in-
dividuals  (Asan  and  Catholic  Medical  Center  [ACMC], 
n=1,082  [case:  272  and  control:  810]).  In  a  combined 
meta-analysis,  a  newly  identified  genetic  locus  in  an  in-
tergenic  region  at  10p11.2  (near  genes  FZD8  and 
ANKRD30A)  showed  the  most  significant  association

Introduction

Osteoporotic  fracture  (OF)  is  a  pivotal  endpoint  pheno-
type  to  determine  risk  factors  in  the  clinical  assessment, 
as  part  of  predictive/preventative  analytics.  Vertebral 
and  hip  fractures,  which  are  the  central  measurements 
and  severe  phenotypes  of  OF,  are  associated  with  high 
morbidity  and  mortality  and  consequently  increase  seri-
ous  social/economic  problems  in  the  elderly  population 
worldwide  (Cooper  et al.,  1992).  Several  risk  factors, 
such  as  age  at  menarche,  gender,  physical  activity,  and 
trauma,  have  been  confirmed  as  environmental  con-
founding  factors  (Dequeker  et al.,  1991).
    Bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  has  been  identified  as 
the  predominant  risk  factor  for  OF.  Most  genetic  studies 
on  osteoporosis  have  focused  primarily  on  the  inter-
mediate  phenotype,  BMD,  whereas  the  genetic  factors 
that  contribute  to  the  risk  of  OF  remain  unknown. 
Recent  genomewide  association  studies  (GWASs)  have 
identified  several  specific  genes  for  BMD  (e.g.,  WNT4- 
ZBTB40, C6orf97, TNFRSF11B-COLEC10, FABP3P2-TNFSF11) 
and  calcaneus  ultrasound  parameters  (i.e.,  WDR77)  in 
European  populations  (Duncan et al.,  2011;  Richards et 
al.,  2008;  Rivadeneira  et al.,  2009;  Roshandel  et al., 
2011;  Styrkarsdottir  et al.,  2008;  Styrkarsdottir  et al., 
2009;  Thorleifsson  et al.,  2009;  Xiong  et al.,  2009). 
Newly  identified  genetic  variants  have  been  reported  in 
Asians  for  osteoporosis  (e.g., FONG, ALDH7A1)  and  os-
teoporotic  fractures  (e.g., JAG1)  (Guo et al.,  2011;  Kou 
et al.,  2011;  Kung  et al.,  2010).
    According  to  data  from  a  large  international  con-
sortium  involving  prominent  Eurocentric  research  groups, 
previously  known  common  genetic  variants  have  shown 
conflicting  results,  with  differential  genetic  effects  and 
limited  replication  between  ethnic  populations  (Cooper 
et al.,  2008;  Ioannidis et al.,  2004;  Ralston et al.,  2006). 
The  European-specific  variants  remain  to  be  validated  in 
East  Asian  populations  to  overcome  ethnic  differences

and  population  structures.  We  therefore  performed  a  ge-
nomewide  association  study  to  determine  the  genetic 
contributions  influencing  the  risk  of  OF  in  Koreans.

Methods 

Study  subjects

recruited  based  on 

The  general  characteristics  of  the  study  samples  and 
the  distribution  of  clinical  values  within  cohort  pop-
ulations  are  shown  in  Table  1.  KARE  study  subjects 
were 
the  Korean  Genome 
Epidemiologic  Study  project.  A  total  of  10,038  partic-
ipants,  who  were  40-69  years  old,  were  registered  at 
the  first  stage  of  the  survey,  performed  in  2001-2002. 
Details  of  the  study  sample  have  been  recently  de-
scribed  (Cho et al.,  2009).  We  distinguished  between  the 
fracture  group  and  nonfracture  group  in  women  of  the 
KARE  study  by  low-trauma  fracture  events.  Fractures 
were  only  included  if  the  fracture  had  occurred  with  low 
trauma  (e.g.,  fall  from  standing  height  or  less)  at  six 
sites  (hip,  wrist,  humerus,  rib,  pelvis,  and  vertebra)  after 
the  age  of  40  years.  Fractures  clearly  caused  by 
high-trauma  events  (motor  vehicle  accidents,  violence, 
or  falls  from  more  than  the  standing  height  of  the  in-
dividual)  were  excluded.  Height  loss  of  ≥4.0  cm  during 
the  follow-up  period  was  also  regarded  as  indicative  of 
a  new  vertebral  fracture.  A  threshold  of  4.0  cm  has 
been  shown  to  have  a  specificity  of  98.3%  and  a  pos-
itive  predictive  value  of  63.9%  for  incident  vertebral 
fractures.  Subjects  who  had  a  history  of  malignancy  or 
received  any  drug  that  might  affect  bone  metabolism 
were  also  excluded.  From  the  KARE  cohort  (Cho et al., 
2009),  we  identified  288  women  aged  40  and  69  years 
with  OF.  As  a  control  group,  we  randomly  selected  up 
to  4-fold  age-/sex-/body  mass  index  (BMI)-/menopausal 
status-matched  nonfractured  subjects 
(n=1139).  The 
ACMC  cohort  was  recruited  from  postmenopausal  wom-
en  in  Asan  Medical  Center  and  Catholic  Medical  Center 
(Kim  et al.,  2010).  The  presence  of  osteoporotic  verte-
bral 
identified  by  a  standardized 
self-questionnaire  and  was  confirmed  by  a  radiological 
examination. 
    In  an  attempt  to  detect  the  genetic  liability  to  OF,  we 

fractures  was 

first  conducted  a  GWAS  as  a  screen  in  an  epidemio-
logical  cohort  study  (Korea  Association  Resource,  KARE, 
n=1427  [cases:  288  and  controls:  1139]).  Next,  Asan 
and  Catholic  Medical  Center  (ACMC)  subjects  (n  =  1082 
[cases:  272  and  controls:  810])  were  used  to  validate 
the  lead  SNP  identified  from  the  GWA  screen.

Genotyping  and  quality  control

A  total  of  10,004  samples  were  genotyped  using 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  and 
processed  by  Bayesian  Robust  Linear  Modeling  using 
Mahalanobis  Distance  (BRLMM)  genotyping  algorithm. 
The  following  individuals  were  excluded:  genotyping 
calls  ＜96%  (n=401),  heterozygosity  ＞30%  (n=11),  sex 
inconsistency  (n=41),  and  identity-by-state  (IBS)  value 
＞0.80  (n=608).  Markers  with  a  high  missing  call  rate  (＞
5%),  minor  allele  frequency  (MAF)  c1%,  and  significant 
deviation  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  (p＜1 
−6)  were  excluded.  The  remaining  359,918  SNPs 
×10
were  used  in  the  subsequent  analyses  for  association 
(Cho et al.,  2009).  We  performed  an  allelic  discrimination 
assay  using  the  GoldenGate  assay  (Illumina  Inc.,  San 
Diego,  CA,  USA)  for  9  SNPs  (rs784288,  rs17546738, 
rs7809764, 
rs12477614, 
rs4753784,  and  rs13434517,  rs2277730)  in  the  ACMC 
cohort.  For  one  SNP  (rs10816453),  we  were  not  able  to 
design  a 
functioning  assay  on  either  platform. 
Genotyping  accuracy  was  conducted  by  assessment  of 
the  genotyping  clustering  accuracy  using  the  Illumina 
Gencall  score  and  by  checking  HWE.  The  Gencall  score 
is  a  measure  of  the  confidence  of  the  clustering  of  in-
dividual  SNP  genotypes.

against  all  of  the  HapMap  Asian  (JTP/CHB)  population 
(release  22/NCBI  build  36  and  dbSNP  bulid  126)  for  a 
total  of  1,573,409  SNPs.  Of  these,  in  each  cohort  we 
dropped  SNPs  with  a  posterior  probability  score  ＜0.90, 
high  genotype  information  content  (info  ＜0.5),  HWE  (p 
−7),  SNP  missing  rate  ＞0.1,  and  MAF  ＜0.01.

Association  analyses

Association  was  analyzed  using  the  PLINK  (http://pngu. 
mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/)  and  SAS  programs  (ver-
sion  9.1;  SAS  institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC).  A  meta-analysis 
was  performed  from  the  combined  results  using  effect 
size  and  standard  errors  estimated  for  each  study.  The 
results  of  all  cohorts  were  combined  by  inverse-variance 
meta-analysis  method  assuming  fixed  effects.  Cochran’s 
Q  test  was  used  to  assess  heterogeneity  between  three 
studies  (Ioannidis et al.,  2007).  All  meta-analysis  calcu-
lations  were  performed  using  R  program  (version  2.7.1).

Quantile-quantile  plot

    Under  the  null  hypothesis  of  no  association,  the  ge-
nomewide  p-values  of  given  SNPs  should  follow  a  uni-
form  distribution.  The  quantile-quantile  plots  of  genome-
wide  p-values  showed  strong  deviation  from  the  null 
distribution  due  to  the  strong  associations  observed  for 
each  quantitative  trait.  Genomic  inflation  factor  (λ)  was 
estimated  from  the  median  of  the  χ2  statistics  by 
0.456.

Comparative  sequence  analysis

To  visualize  and  analyze  evolutionary  conserved  regions 
(ECRs)  in  the  genome  of  sequenced  species,  we  per-
formed  a  sequence  conservation  analysis  of  a  1.45-Mb 
target  region  in  five  mammalian  species  (chimpanzee, 
monkey,  dog,  cow,  and  mouse).  ECRbase  is  the  data-
base  of  ECRs,  promoters,  and  transcription  factor  bind-
ing  sites  in  vertebrate  genomes,  created  using  ECR 
browser  alignments  (http://ecrbrowser.dcode.org/)  (Loots 
and  Ovcharenko,  2007).

In silico  analysis

We  used  SUSPECTS  (www.genetics.med.ed.ac.uk/sus-
pects/)  (Adie et al.,  2005),  a  system  for  matching  gene 
ontology  terms,  interpro  domains,  and  gene  expression 
data,  built  on  top  of  the  PROSPECTR  candidate  prioriti-
zation  system.  SUSPECTS  examines  the  gene  ex-
pression  profile  and  compares  it  to  the  profiles  from  the 

match  set  using  Spearman’s  rho  rank-order  correlation. 
A  weighted  average  is  then  calculated,  and  a  ranked  list 
of  genes  is  displayed. 
    To  investigate  functional  protein  association  networks, 
we  used  STRING  (http://string-db.org/).  STRING  is  a  da-
tabase  of  known  and  predicted  protein-protein  inter-
actions,  where  the  interactions  are  either  direct  or  in-
direct  for  substantiating  newly  generated  data  (Szklarc-
zyk et al.,  2011).  Nodes  represent  biological  entities  with 
different  colors  for  different  classes.  Edges  represent 
strong  associations  between  two  entities  (e.g.,  FZD8  ef-
fects  on  Wnt  proteins,  and  functional  interactions  with 
LRP5/6  and  DKK1/2)  (Fig.  1D).

The  Q-Q  plot  indicated  a  lack  of  inflation  due  to  pop-

marized  information  on  the  functional  interactive  net-
works  by  confidence  values  of  the  association  evidence 
(Fig.  1D).

Discussion 

In  this  study,  we  performed  a  GWAS  and  follow-up  rep-
lication  on  OF  and  identified  a  new  genetic  locus  in  an 
intergenic  region.  So  far,  BMD  susceptibility  genes  from 
GWASs  have  been  reported  primarily  in  samples  of 
European  descent.  The  previously  reported  significant 
genomewide  associations  explain  only  a  small  fraction 
of  variance  in  BMD.  BMD  is  not  the  only  risk  factor  for 

56    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  9(2)  52-58,  June  2011

OF.  To  our  knowledge,  the  contribution  of  genetic  sus-
ceptibility  to  OF  is  the  first  such  evidence  reported. 
    Within  1-Mb  flanking  region,  nearby  genes  include 
FZD8  (fizzled  homolog  8)  and  ANKRD30A  (ankyrin  re-
peat  domain  30A),  which  are  approximately  850  kb  and 
600  kb  from  the  GWAS  signal,  respectively.  FZD8,  a 
member  of  the  frizzled  gene  family,  is  an  obvious  candi-
date  gene  for  osteoporosis.  Functionally,  this  intronless 
gene  has  been  proposed  to  participate  in  bone  for-
mation/resorption  as  a  receptor  for  Wnt  proteins  (Nam 
et al.,  2006).  Most  frizzled  receptors  are  coupled  to 
LRP5/6  in  the  canonical  Wnt  signaling  pathway,  which 
leads  to  the  inhibition  of  GSK-3  kinase,  nuclear  accumu-
lation  of  beta-catenin,  and  activation  of  Wnt  target 
genes  (Bourhis  et al.,  2010;  Saitoh  et al.,  2001). 
    ANKRD30A  (or  NY-BR-1)  has  been  previously  re-
ported  with  a  novel  breast  differentiation  antigen  and  a 
breast  tissue-specific  putative  transcription  factor  for 
cancer  immunotherapy  (Jager et al.,  2007;  Jager et al., 
2001;  Theurillat  et al.,  2008).  NY-BR-1  expression  is 
more  frequent  in  estrogen  receptor-positive  carcinoma 
(Varga  et al.,  2006).  It  has  been  suggested  that  post-
menopausal  survivors  of  breast  cancer  have  a  higher 
risk  for  fractures  compared  with  women  who  have  no 
cancer  history  (Neuner  et al.,  2010).  Hence,  its  role  in 
the  pathogenesis  of  OF  is  not  clear,  and  the  gene  func-
tion  should  be  clarified  in  further  investigations.
    In  an in silico  study  for  predicting  the  function  of  the 
SNP  allele  (Lee  and  Shatkay,  2009;  Yuan  et al.,  2006), 
the  previous  information,  including  physical  and  func-
tional  associations,  was  not  enough  to  assign  a  poten-
tial  biological  function  to  an  uncharacterized  intergenic 
sequence  variant  (data  not  shown).  However,  our  finding 
was  further  supported  by  functional  connectivity  results, 
derived  from  bioinformatic  approaches  (Lee  and  Shatkay, 
2009;  Szklarczyk et al.,  2011).  The  RefSeq  genes  (FZD8 
and ANKRD30A)  might  be  novel  and  potential  candidate 
genes  contributing  to  the  risk  of  osteoporotic  fracture 
with  the  same  phenotypic  effect  (Fig.  1C  and  D). 
Therefore,  this  concordance  of  functional  evidence  with 
previous  studies  suggests  an  encouraging  sign  of  the 
results  in  our  GWAS.

positive  selection,  statistics  for  Fst  and  iHS  (integrated 
haplotype  score)  were  considered  to  show  significant 
evidence,  derived  from  an  empirical  p-value  using  the 
HapMap  data  (Voight  et al.,  2006).  In  situations  where 
selection  is  restricted  to  certain  populations  or  geo-
graphical  locations,  the  allele  frequencies  at  the  locus 
may  vary  between  ethnic  populations.  There  were  no 
significant  differences  between  interpopulations  (data 
not  shown).  However,  the  intergenic  SNP  rs17546738 
showed  a  widespread  degree  of  conservation  in  mam-

mals  (five  species),  and  functional  conservation  in  verte-
brates  may  play  an  elementary  role  in  vertebral  fracture 
risk  (Fig.  1B).  Therefore,  a  comparative  genomic  analysis 
of  highly  conserved  intergenic  sequences  may  provide 
valuable  insights  into  their  function  in  genetic  diversity 
(Loots  and  Ovcharenko,  2007). 
    The  present  study  has  a  major  limitation.  Due  to  the 
small  number  of  patients,  the  p-value  did  not  reach  the 
conventional  genomewide  significance  threshold  of  ＜5 
−8.  It  was  also  difficult  to  find  an  appropriate  repli-
×10
cation  set  that  possessed  similar  genetic  variations  and 
traits  in  an  independent  ethnic  group.  Despite  this  limi-
tation,  an  apparent  advantage  of  our  finding  was  re-
plicated  in  the  same  direction  of  the  effect  from  hospi-
tal-based  subjects  with  the  well-defined  homogeneous 
phenotype.  It  is  reasonable  to  search  for  genetic  factors 
of  fracture  risk  in  postmenopausal  women  who  have  a 
higher  fracture  risk  than  others.  Since  fractures  at  differ-
ent  skeletal  sites  may  have  confounding  effects  under-
lying  pathological  mechanisms,  we  mainly  focused  on 
osteoporotic  fractures  (low-trauma)  in  order  to  minimize 
the  potential  clinical  and  genetic  heterogeneity  of  the 
study  phenotype.
    In  conclusion,  we  suggest 
locus 
(rs17546738)  in  a  highly  conserved  intergenic  region  is 
consistently  associated  with  OF.  Further  replication 
studies  with  independent  ethnic  populations  or  larger 
samples  are  needed  to  fully  evaluate  the  effect  of  the 
variant.  We  anticipate  that  identification  of  the  causal 
variants  through  deep  sequencing  and  their  functional 
consequences  will  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the 
pathogenesis  of  OF  in  bone  metabolism.
