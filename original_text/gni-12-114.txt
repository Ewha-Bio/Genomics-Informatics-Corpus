Bone mineral density (BMD) is one of the quantitative traits that are genetically inherited and affected by various factors. 
Over the past years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have searched for many genetic loci that influence BMD. A 
recent meta-analysis of 17 GWASs for BMD of the femoral neck and lumbar spine is the largest GWAS for BMD to date and 
offers  64  single-nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  56  associated  loci.  We  investigated  these  BMD  loci  in  a  Korean 
population called Korea Association REsource (KARE) to identify their validity in an independent study. The KARE population 
contains genotypes from 8,842 individuals, and their BMD levels were measured at the distal radius (BMD-RT) and midshaft 
tibia (BMD-TT). Thirteen genomic loci among 56 loci were significantly associated with BMD variations, and 3 loci were 
involved in known biological pathways related to BMD. In order to find putative functional variants, nearby SNPs in relation 
to linkage equilibrium were annotated, and their possible functional effects were predicted. These findings reveal that tens 
of variants, not a single factor, may contribute to the genetic architecture of BMD; have an important role regardless of ethnic 
group; and may highlight the importance of a replication study in GWASs to validate genuine loci for BMD variation.

Introduction

In an aging society, osteoporosis is a major health pro-
blem. It is characterized by systemic impairment of bone 
mass, strength, and microarchitecture, leading to increased 
risk of fragility fractures, particularly hip fracture [1]. In the 
United  States,  the  cost  of  incident  fractures  due  to  oste-
oporosis and low bone mass was $17 billion in 2006. It is 
expected to rise to around $25.3 billion by the year 2025 [2]. 
Likewise,  the  burden  for  them  is  prevalent  in  Asia.  The 
annual incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures increased 
to 1,661, 1,646, 1,623, and 1,614 per 100,000 persons from 
2005 to 2008 in Korea [3]. Osteoporosis is defined by the 
measurement of bone mineral density (BMD), which is so far 
the best single predictor [4, 5].

BMD  is  a  genetic  component,  with  estimates  of  herit-
ability ranging from 0.46 to 0.84 at all skeletal sites [6]. In 
recent  years,  genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs) 
have enhanced the understanding of the genetic architecture 
underlying quantitative traits and common, complex dise-

ases  [7].  These  studies  provide  key  insights  into  the 
variation of quantitative traits and prospects for designing 
specifically effective strategies for diseases [8]. There have 
been many GWASs  to identify genetic loci that influence 
BMD, and dozens of candidates have been presented [9-13]. 
However, only several loci have been consistently identified 
in a few replication studies [14-16], suggesting that BMD is 
a complex trait affected by multiple components [17].

Recently, a meta-analysis of 17 studies for BMD of the 
femoral neck and lumbar spine was performed for the first 
time in order to identify consensus BMD-associated single- 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout races [18]. It 
included 32,951 individuals across North America, Europe, 
East  Asia,  and  Australia.  The  meta-analysis  offered  56 
associated  loci  that  were  highly  significant  in  both  the 
discovery stage and replication stage. This also proposed a 
model  of  BMD  loci  and  successfully  validated  it  with  an 
independent population.

Here,  we  investigate  those  56  BMD  loci  in  a  Korean 
population called Korea Association REsource (KARE) [19].

The analysis showed that BMD variation is a polygenic and 
complex trait, and it could be even different, depending on 
sex and the skeletal site. The finding that some crucial loci 
are still significant in KARE supports the validity of BMD 
loci.  This  study  may  contribute  to  the  importance  of  a 
replication  study  in  GWASs  to  understand  the  common 
mechanism underlying BMD.

onto the haplotype estimates by IMPUTE2. Imputation was 
carried out for the regions within 500 kb on either side of 64 
SNPs  reported  in  the  previous  GWAS  [18].  SNPs  with  a 
minor allele frequency ＜ 0.01 and imputation quality score 
(INFO)  ＜ 0.4  were  filtered  out.  Then,  we  combined  51 
imputed  SNPs  with  9  directly  typed  KARE  SNPs  for 
association analyses.

Methods
Study subjects

Subjects from the KARE GWAS have been described [19]. 
Since it launched in 2001, the total of 10,038 participants 
have been recruited from the Anseong and Ansan cohorts in 
the Republic of Korea. Both cohorts were designed to view a 
variety of quantitative traits from a long-term perspective. 
Besides, clinical surveys have been performed through epi-
demiological  surveys  and  physical  examinations.  Partici-
pants have been examined every 2 years, with a third follow- 
up  study  in  2008.  The  analysis  of  KARE  data  has  been 
approved by the Korea National Institute for Bioethics Policy 
(KONIBP), Republic of Korea (P01-201311-RS-02-01).

Genotyping, quality control, and imputation

A total of 10,004 DNA samples were genotyped with the 
Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0  (Affy-
metrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Genotypes were called by 
Bayesian  Robust  Linear  Modeling  using  the  Mahalanobis 
Distance (BRLMM) algorithm [20]. The quality score crite-
ria and procedures have been described in a previous GWAS 
[19]. After each step of the quality control, genotypes from 
8,842 individuals with a total of 352,228 markers were left 
and  used  for  the  association  analysis.  In  this  study,  we 
additionally excluded 257 individuals taking medication that 
influenced BMD levels.

SNP imputation was conducted using the IMPUTE2 pro-
gram [21]. The 1000 Genomes Phase I integrated haplotypes 
(released in Dec 2013), produced using SHAPEIT2 in NCBI 
build 37 coordinates, were used as the reference panel [22]. 
All 1,092 individuals with 36.8 million SNPs were initially 
utilized, and haplotypes with singleton sites were removed. 
Since there is no X chromosome in the current version of the 
reference panel, a previous version (released in Mar 2012) 
was used as the reference panel for the X chromosome.

Because the previous GWAS was based on NCBI build 36, 
SNP positions should be converted to build 37 coordinates 
by using the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) 
liftOver  tool  [23].  SNP  orientations  were  aligned  to  the 
forward strand using PLINK [24]. In order to improve the 
performance of the SNP imputation, SNPs were pre-phased 
by SHAPEIT2 [22, 25]. Then, SNPs were imputed directly 

Statistical analysis

The association analyses were done using PLINK version 
1.07 [24] for both genotyped and imputed SNPs. A test for 
BMD was done by linear regression with an additive model 
(1 degree of freedom [d.f.]) after adjustments for age, sex, 
and  recruitment  area.  Statistical  significance  was  deter-
mined by p ＜ 0.05 in a two-tailed test. p-values were not 
adjusted for multiple testing of SNPs. Proximal SNPs and 
pairwise  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  were  computed  by 
PLINK.  A  threshold  for  correlation  was  set  as  r2  >  0.8. 
Annotation of SNPs was done by SNPnexus [26]. The effect 
of SNPs on protein function was predicted using SIFT [27] 
and PolyPhen [28]. Transcription factor binding sites were 
inferred from the TRANSFAC database [29].

Results

The  KARE  study  population  included  GWA  genotypes 
from 8,842 individuals [19]. We removed 257 individuals 
currently taking medication to remove any potential influ-
ence on BMD. BMD was measured by speed of sound (SOS) 
at the distal radius (BMD-RT) and midshaft tibia (BMD-TT), 
but the value was transformed to T-score for analysis. The 
mean T-score of the radius and tibia of the 8,586 subjects was 
0.038 ± 0.016 (SEM) and –0.472 ± 0.017, respectively.
The meta-analysis of 17 GWASs identified 64 SNPs in 56 
loci  associated  with  BMD  with  genomewide  significance. 
The  analysis  also  proposed  a  model  of  BMD-decreasing 
alleles, and their effects were validated with an independent 
population: a prospective study in postmenopausal Danish 
women  aged  55–86  years.  The  alleles  were  scored  with 
weights  based  on  their  individual  effects  on  BMD.  Even 
though the previous GWAS was based on lumbar spine and 
femoral neck BMD, we assumed that the effects of BMD loci 
would be available to BMD at other sites, such as the distal 
radius and midshaft tibia. Thus, the model was applied to the 
KARE population to prove its validity.

Among 64 SNPs, 9 SNPs were genotyped in the chip, but 
55 other SNPs were imputed from genotypes in the 1000 
Genomes (1KG) Project (Phase I). After filtering, 60 SNPs 
were  used  for  the  analysis,  and  individuals  were  scored 
according to the scoring system of the previous study. Then, 
individuals were grouped into five bins based on their scores,

and the mean of BMD of each group was measured (Fig. 1). 
While BMD-RT did not follow the model proposed in the 
previous study, BMD-TT showed the pattern as expected. In 
other words, BMD at the midshaft tibia decreased as the 
score  increased.  The  analysis  on  the  basis  of  60  SNPs 
explained 3.2% of the total genetic variance in BMD-TT.

In order to identify variants significantly influential in the 
Korean population, an association analysis of 60 SNPs was 
done  with  KARE  data.  Single-marker  tests  of  association 

with BMD were carried out by trend test (1 d.f.) after adju-
stments for age, sex, and recruitment area (Table 1). Twelve 
SNPs showed a directionally consistent association with the 
previous GWAS (p ＜ 0.05). Six loci were associated with 
BMD-RT  and  six  loci  were  associated  with  BMD-TT,  but 
there were no loci associated with both. One of these loci is 
on the X chromosome. The same analysis was carried out by 
gender strarification (Table 2). Three loci were prioritized in 
the female sample set, and one of them (rs13204965) was

mesenchymal  stem  cell  differentiation  (SP7),  and  Wnt 
signaling (WNT4). Interestingly, SNPs in TNFRSF11B and 
SP7  were  associated  with  BMD-RT,  whereas  the  SNP  in 
WNT4 was associated with BMD-TT (Tables 1 and 2).

For the purpose of identifying putative functional SNPs, 
markers in the surrounding 100-Kb region were examined 
using LD (Table 3). Likewise, they were imputed from 1KG 
Phase I, centered on 13 loci. Eight BMD-associated SNPs 
were  highly  correlated  (r2  >  0.8)  with  functional  SNPs 
annotated in the 1KG reference. rs13245690 was related to 5 
putative  functional  variants,  which  correlated  with  each 
other  by  LD  (r2  >  0.8).  Two  SNPs  (rs1524498  and 
rs41281692) were located within coding regions in CPED1. 
rs1524498  leads  to  synonymous  coding,  but  rs41281692 
leads  to  a  conservative  change  of  an  amino  acid.  The 
remaining 3 SNPs (rs10228519, rs10274486, and rs1357756) 
were  located  in  the  intronic  regions  in  CPED1  and  are 
predicted to alter alleles in transcription factor binding sites. 
Each allele was anticipated to affect the binding of CUTL1, 
POU2F1, and GATA-1, respectively.

rs2016266  in  SP7  was  correlated  with  two  SNPs 
(rs1318648  and  rs17125266)  in  ESPL1.  Both  were  asso-
ciated with missense mutations. rs17125266 was predicted 
to  be  conservative,  but  rs1318648  was  predicted  to  be 
deleterious. rs2062377 was related to a conservative mis-
sense variant in TNFRSF11B. On the contrary, rs12821008 
was  related  to  the  sense  variant.  Two  other  SNPs  were 
associated  with  the  3'  untranslated  region:  rs1346004  in

independent SNPs were selected for further analysis (Fig. 2).
As mentioned in the previous GWAS, some of these 13 
SNPs were seen as members of biological pathways related 
to BMD: the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (TNFRSF11B),

In this report, we identified that the model proposed in a 
previous GWAS [18] is available to the Korean population. 
Furthermore, we found 13 genomic loci significantly asso-
ciated with BMD variations in the population. Our results 
reveal  that  dozens  of  variants  with  small  effects  may 
contribute  to  the  genetic  architecture  of  BMD  and  have 
important roles, regardless of ethnic groups.

Our study supports the important role of several biolo-
gical pathways related to BMD. The Wnt factor (WNT4) has 
been  known to  be associated with BMD  in many studies 
[30-32].  A  pathway  involved  in  mesenchymal  stem  cell 
differentiation (SP7) was also previously known [33, 34]. 
The RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway (TNFRSF11B) is another 
pathway influencing BMD [35-37]. Interestingly, SNPs in 
TNFRSF11B and SP7 were associated with BMD-RT, whereas 
an  SNP  in  WNT4  was  associated  with  BMD-TT.  It  may 
suggest  differential  genetic  influences  between  skeletal 
sites.

In line with this phenomenon, our results reveal that there 
is  sex-  and  site-specificity  underlying  BMD  variation. 

rs13204965  was  only  significant  in  women  and  showed 
significant sex heterogeneity. Also, in the same manner, the 
variant was only associated with females in a previous GWAS 
[18]. In a recent GWAS focusing on women of a specific age 
(postmenopausal  women,  age  55–85  years),  rs13204965 
was associated with BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar 
spine [13]. In case of rs13245690, a sex-stratified analysis in 
women  showed  a  more  significant  result  than  in  pooled 
samples.  These  results  reflect  the  sexual  dimorphism  of 
bone. Based on the different composition at different skeletal 
sites,  all  12  loci  that  were  significant  in  pooled  samples 
showed site specificity in BMD. Interestingly, even though 
the extent of effect size was different from skeletal sites, the 
direction was consistent between sites. This indicates that 
BMD-associated loci commonly affect BMD determination 
across skeletal sites, but the different sensitivity of each site 
may lead to differential genetic impact on BMD variation.

This could account for the decreased effect size of BMD 
loci  in  the  Korean  population.  While  the  meta-analysis 
looked at the BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, the 
KARE focused on BMD at the distal radius and midshaft 
tibia.  Besides,  the  former  were  measured  by  dual-energy 
X-ray absorptiometry, but the latter were estimated as SOS 
by quantitative ultrasound. It has been previously shown 
that  BMD  of  the  radius,  assessed  by  ultrasound,  poorly 
coincides with radiologically assessed BMD at the lumbar

spine [38]. These represent the limitations of this study—
that direct replication at specific sites cannot be performed. 
Nevertheless, some loci found in the previous GWAS still 
showed a directionally consistent association in this study. 
This suggests that a common mechanism underlies BMD 
throughout different skeletal sites.

In  order  to  identify  putative  functional  variants,  SNP-
nexus was chosen to annotate proxy SNPs near the BMD- 
associated loci. In coding regions, some SNPs were expected 
to  present  single  amino  acid  substitutions  that  could  be 
damaging or tolerated. On the other hand, the other SNPs 
were  expected  to  be  synonymous.  However,  this  type  of 
mutation  sometimes  leads  to  unsuspected  effects.  Other 
annotated  SNPs  had  possible  functional  effects  on  the 
regulation of splicing or the binding activity of transcription 
factors.  To  understand  how  genetic  variants  affect  the 
phenotype exactly, multi-layered experimental approaches 
should be carried out in the future.

In conclusion, these findings highlight the polygenic and 
complex variation of BMD, which could differ even by sex 
and  skeletal  site,  but  provide  evidence  of  the  validity  in 
BMD-associated  loci  between  independent  populations. 
This study may contribute to the importance of replication 
studies in GWASs in understanding the common mecha-
nism underlying BMD.
