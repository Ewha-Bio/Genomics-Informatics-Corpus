Abstract 

In  microarray  technology,  many  diverse  experimental 
features  can  cause  biases  including  RNA  sources, 
microarray  production  or  different  platforms,  diverse 
sample  processing  and  various  experiment  protocols. 
These systematic effects cause a substantial obstacle in 
the  analysis  of microarray  data.  When  such  data  sets 
derived from different experimental processes were used, 
the analysis result was almost inconsistent and  it is  not 
reliable. Therefore, one of the most pressing challenges in 
the microarray field is how to combine data that comes from 
two different groups. As the novel trial to integrate two data 
sets with batch effect, we simply applied standardization 
to microarray data before the significant gene selection. In 
the gene selection step, we used new defined measure that 
considers the distance between a gene and an ideal gene 
as well as the between-slide and within-slide variations. 
Also we discussed the association of biological functions 
and different expression patterns in selected discriminative 
gene set. As a result, we could confirm that batch effect was 
minimized by standardization and the selected genes from 
the standardized data included various expression patterns 
and the significant biological functions.

Introduction 

In  microarray  technology,  many  diverse  experimental 
features can cause experimental  biases including RNA 
sources  and  quality,  microarray production  or different 
platforms.  Additionally,  samples  can  be  collected  and 
processed  at  different  institutions  and  assayed  using 
different array hybridization protocols. These systematic 
effects causing diverse variations present a substantial 
obstacle to the analysis of microarray data.  Due to the 
limited  numbers  of  miroarray  experiments,  however, 
sometimes the indication to use whole data regardless 
of platforms is increasing. When such data sets derived 
from  different  experimental  processes  were  used,  the 
result  of  analysis  was  often  inconsistent  with  little 
reliable information. Therefore, one of the most pressing 
challenges in the microarray field is how to combine the 
data that comes from the two different groups. 

Most  existing  studies  that  have  analyzed  multiple 
independently  collected  microarray  data  sets  have 
focused  on  the differential  expressions,  comparing two 
or  more  similar  data  sets  to  find  the  genes  that 
distinguish different groups of samples (Breitling  eta/., 
2002; Rhodes eta/., 2002; Yuen eta/., 2002; Choi eta/., 
2003;  Detours  et at.,  2003;  Ramaswamy  et at.,  2003; 
Sorlie  et  a/.,  2003;  Xin  et a/.,  2003).  Another  type  of 
comparison is exemplified by a study that examined the 
variability of expression for the individual gene in several 
human  and  mouse data sets  (Lee  eta/.,  2002).  These 
studies  have  exploited  the  availability  of multiple  data 
sets to identify more robust sets of genes than would be 
found using a single data set. 

Recently,  the integration of the data sets before the 
significant gene selection  has been  introduced using a 
method  by correcting  systematic bias of the data sets, 
Singular Value Decompositions (SVDs) in the yeast cell 
cycle experiments (Alter eta/., 2000),  and in a data set 
containing many soft tissue tumors (Nielsen eta/., 2002). 
It  has  been  suggested  that  SVD  is  an  inappropriate 
method  when  the  magnitude  of  the  systematic  effect 
variation  is  similar  to  other  components  of variations, 
although  SVD  is  a  method  to  find  directions  of  large 
variation for removal of systematic effects (Benito eta/., 
2004 ).  Distance  Weighted  Discrimination  (DWD),  a 
modified form of SVM for the adjustment of systematic 
effects  eliminated  source  effect  and  showed  the  good 
performance (Benito eta/., 2004).  However, it still could 

not correct some problem such as dispersion of different 
data  sets.  Moreover,  previous  studies  have  not  been 
discussed  the  biological  significance  for  evaluation  of 
integration method. 

Here, we suggested a method which effectively integrates 
the  different  experimental  features  and  selected  the 
discriminative gene set from the integrated data set using 
the unique gene selection method,  and finally discussed 
biological significance of selected gene set. 

Materials and Methods 
Data sets 
A microarray data set used in this study was consisted of 
5  experimental  groups  to  understand  the  molecular 
mechanism of tumor angiogenesis in vitro. The HUVEC 
(Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells) were obtained 
from ATCC (American Tissue Culture Collection,  USA) 
and  cultured  following  the  recommended  guidelines. 
The  HUVEC were  cultured  in  5  different experimental 
conditions including 1) with serum, 2) upon the matrigel 
as  an  extracellular  matrix,  3)  with  co-culturing  with 
YCC-3  gastric  cancer  cells,  which  is  established  from 
the ascites of Korean advanced gastric cancer patient in 
the  Cancer  Metastasis  Research  Center  (CMRC, 
Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea), 4) 
without  serum,  and  5)  combination  of  matrigel  and 
co-culturing with YCC-3 cells. 

The  eDNA microarray was  performed  using  human 
eDNA  chips  (CMRC-GT,  Seoul,  Korea)  with  17664 
genes  in  2  batches,  which  were  spotted  in  2  different 
time  with  the  same  eDNA  clones.  eDNA  microarray 
experiments were performed  in  triplicates following the 
established protocol of CMRC in a reference design with 
the Yonsei Reference RNA of 11  cancer cell line pooled 
RNA (CMRC, Seoul,  Korea,  Kim eta/., 2005). This data 
set included missing entries in the range of 349 to 785 for 
each  experiment,  and  16466  genes  without  missing 
entries were used for further analysis. 

Data normalization 
We  normalized  expression 
intensities  so  that  the 
intensities or log-ratios have similar distributions across 
a series of arrays. The method used in this study is that 
the MAD (median-absolute-deviation) scale estimator is 
replaced  with 
the 
A-values1) are normalized as well as the M-values2l. 

the  median-absolute-value  and

transforms  expression 
values to make intensities consistent within  each array 
and between-slide normalization transforms expression 
values  to  achieve  consistency  between  arrays. 
Normalization  between  arrays  is  usually,  but  not 
necessarily,  applied  after  normalization  within  arrays. 
We  applied  between-slide  normalization  to  expression 
data because there were different dispersions between 
arrays  after  within-slide  normalization.  We  executed 
normalization  by  using  'limma'  library  of  R  package 
(http://www.r-project.org). 

Standardization of expression data 
In order to reduce the bias which can be occurred in each 
gene expression from different batches, we standardized 
gene expression ratio to a mean ± s.d. of 0 ± 1 in each 
batch respectively. The standardized expression ratio Zij 
is calculated as following. 

where  X;1  is  the  expression  level  of it"  gene  in  l" 

experiment. 

X;  is the mean expression level of ith  gene. 
Denominator is standard deviation of expression 
levels of ith gene. 
N;  is the number of experiments of i1

"  gene. 

Significant gene selection 
We  selected  discriminative  genes  that  differently 
expressed  in  various  experimental  groups  after  the 
normalization and standardization of microarray data set. 
The parametric statistical methods, including t-test, were 
not  appropriate  to  the  current  data  set  because  the 
replications of data were not sufficient enough to assume 
any  specific  distribution  of  data.  Even  nonparametric 
method,  requiring  at  least 5  replications  of data (Kanji, 
1993), was not applicable. Therefore, we defined a new 
measure for the discriminative gene selection, based on 
the variation rather than a mean difference between slides.

The  small  value  of this  measure  suggests  that the

In the selection of significant genes which have clear 

expression pattern-over expressed or under expressed(cid:173)
in  a  specific experimental  group,  we  defined  the  ideal 
genes  expressed  in  a  specific  experimental  group. 
When  we  defined  new  measure,  we  considered  the 
distance between these ideal  genes and  each gene,  in 
addition  to  variation  of expression  values of a gene.  It 
resulted that the selected genes with smaller within-slide 
closed  to  expression  levels  of ideal  genes.  We  could 
define 
the  case  of  three

The  new metric,  MM,  was defined  as following  and 

calculated for each gene.

and ideal target genes. 

A gene with small MM is considered as discriminative 
and it is over-expressed or under-expressed in experimental 
groups. 

We evaluated the selected gene set by classification 
accuracy  and  used  Random  Forest  algorithm  (RF, 
8reiman,  2001 ).  We  used  RF  program  in  R  package 
(http://www.r-project.org) with the following steps. 

( 1) Generate n data sets of bootstrap samples {81,  82 , 
· · .. · ·,  8n} by allowing repetition ofthe same sample. 
(2) Use each sample 8k to construct a Tree classifier 
Tk  to  predict  those  samples  that  are  not  in  8k 
,called  out-of-bag 
(008)  samples.  These 

predictions are called out-of-bag estimators. 

(3)  Final  prediction  is  the  average  of  out-of-bag 
estimators over all bootstrap samples and we get 
average  of them  which  is  overall  classification 
error (008 error).

Results and Discussion 
Fig.  1 shows the result of within and between-slide normal(cid:173)
ization of microarray data. 

The last six boxplots in Fig.  1 b had larger inter-quartile 
range (lOR) than the other box plots. It means there were 
larger variations in the 9-151
h experiments than the other 
experiments  when  only within-slide  normalization  was 
applied to data set. Those experiments were processed 
experimentally in different batches and this problem was 
removed by between-slide normalization (Fig.  1c). 

M.YCC3  and  woSerum  experimental  groups  were 
experimentally processed in the same batch differing from 
the  remainder  groups.  When  we  applied  unsupervised 
clustering method with whole data set, three experimental 
groups (HUVEC,  Matrigel, YCC3) and two experimental 
groups (woSerum, M.YCC3) were separated and groups 
in  same  batch  were  fastened  together.  Therefore,  we 
could confirm that some batch effect exists in the data set 
(Fig.  2a).  With  standardization  of  data,  HUVEC  and 
woSurum  experimental  groups  from  different  batches 
were  fastened  together and  other experimental  groups 
were well intermingled (Fig. 2b ), suggesting that the batch 
effect is minimized. 

As a next step, we selected the discriminative genes 
that classified  different experimental  groups accurately 
by  the  proposed  method.  Only  three  most  significant 
genes  had  0%  008 (one  out  of  bag)  error.  Table  1 
shows the summarization of these selected genes. 

We  noted  that  the  008  error  did  not  increase  in

groups.  Even though,  the clustering  result  using whole 
gene set was slightly different from the one using top 100 
genes,  it showed  more specific patterns.  Therefore we 
confirmed  that  small  set  of  genes  might  be  more 
effective to classify different experimental groups. 

We  analyzed  biological  interpretations  of five  gene 
clusters  by  k-means  clustering  method  and  explored 
expression  patterns  of  each  cluster  (Table  2).  Five 
clusters  showed  the  different  expression  patterns  and 
were  expected  that  such  different expression  patterns 
have different biological functions. 

In addition, we did significance analysis of biological 
functions  using  EASE  and  used  top  1000  genes  as 
background  genes.  EASE  calculates  the  degree  of 
significance, EASE score, of biological function including 
selected gene set. Fisher exact test can be used for this 
purpose,  however, we offered  EASE score.  We should 
put  whole  gene  set  as  background  to  calculate  EASE 
score but used top 1000 genes because of run time error 
possibly  due  to  huge  data  size.  Therefore,  if we  used 
whole  gene  set as  background,  EASE  score  might be 
decreased than  the  values  shown  in  Table 3.  Top  100 
genes were concerned with various biological functions 
corresponding to three categories of biological process, 
molecular  function,  and  cellular  component.  We  also 
investigated the association of expression patterns and 

corresponding biological functions for each gene clusters 
Biological  functions  in  the  first  gene  cluster  were 
mainly related to molecular function. All of the biological 
functions  of  the  second  gene  cluster  were  about 
biological processes, which were highly significant. The 
third  and  the  fourth  gene  clusters  had  not  include 
significant  biological  functions  but  those  genes  were 
relatively significant in cellular component and biological 
process  respectively.  The  fifth  gene  cluster  included 
genes that had biological functions related to Carboxylic 
acid metabolism and Organic acid metabolism. Meanwhile, 
we observed some ir-regularities. As in Table 3, the same 
gene sets had highly significant two biological functions; 
one is Regulation of cell cycle and Mitotic cell cycle in the 
second  gene  cluster  and  the  other  is  Carboxylic  acid 
metabolism and Organic acid metabolism in the fifth gene 
cluster. 

AA458634,  T49159,  and  Al524212,  which  were 
selected  as the  most significant genes,  were clustered 
into the first and the fourth gene clusters. While AA458634 
was  concerned  as  in  highly  significant  function  of 
biological process, T 49159 was related to the cell death 
but not concerned to any significant biological function. 
From  this,  we  confirmed  that  the  significant  biological 
functions are caused by the interactions of genes or gene 
sets,  not by the several most significant genes. 

We selected  seven  genes with  0%  OOB error from 
non-standardized data set. It is relatively larger gene set 
comparing to the result from the standardized data set and 
any of them were not consistent with three genes selected 
from standardized data set (data not shown).  From the 
functional annotation analysis using DAVID (Database for 
Annotation,  Visualization  and  Integrated  Discovery,  http.!/ 
apps1.niaid.nih.gov!davidl),  72.6%  of  top  100  genes 
selected from the standardized data set included in any 
categories  of  biological  functions  but  64.9%  in  the

non-standardized data set did. Also, the result of cluster 
analysis  of  top  100  genes  was  unbalanced  in  non(cid:173)
standardized  data  set.  Almost  half of the  genes  were 
clustered into the second gene cluster and only eight and 
five genes were clustered into the forth and the fifth gene 
clusters,  respectively.  Gene  sets  expressed  in  three 
experimental conditions- Matrigel, YCC3, and M.YCC3-
included significant biological functions, while gene sets 
expressed in the other experimental conditions did not in 
the non-standardized data set (The least EASE scores 
were  0.49  and  0.34).  Though  the  significances  of 
biological functions of the third and the forth gene clusters 
in standardized data set were low, five gene clusters had 
relatively significant biological functions. This means that 
we could select more discriminative genes representing 
various expression patterns, which can be interpreted as 
various  representative  biological  functions  from  the 
standardized data set. 

Most  selected  discriminative  genes  from  the  non(cid:173)

standardized  data  were  clustered  into  the  same  gene 
cluster meaning that the selected genes had  redundant 
expression  patterns.  On  the  other  hand,  the  selected 
genes  from  the  standardized  data  included  various 
expression  patterns  and 
the  significant  biological 
functions.  It suggests that the problem of redundancy in 
gene selection was solved by the standardization. 

Before  discriminative  gene  selection,  we  applied 
standardization to expression ratios respectively in each 
batch to control batch effect. As a result, we could confirm 
that batch effect was minimized using dendrograms). The 
selected discriminative genes in this study were selected 
by the  expression  pattern  but  not  by  the  magnitude  of 
expression  ratio.  However  this  method  can  not  be 
appropriate when  different batches  include  biologically 
significant  differences  because  the  standardization 
transforms the expression values into a relative score of 
a gene expression in each batch. Hence, currently we are 
on  the study about investigating  more efficient method 
that is useful in such condition.
