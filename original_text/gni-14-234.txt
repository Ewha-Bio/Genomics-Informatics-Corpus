Different mechanisms, including transcriptional and post transcriptional processes, regulate tissue specific expression of 
genes.  In  this  study,  we  report  differences  in  gene/protein  compositional  features  between  apoptosis  involved  genes 
selectively expressed in human tissues. We found some correlations between codon/amino acid usage and tissue specific 
expression level of genes. The findings can be significant for understanding the translational selection on these features. The 
selection may play an important role in the differentiation of human tissues and can be considered for future studies in 
diagnosis of some diseases such as cancer.

Introduction

Regulation of gene expression level is an important step in 
different biological processes [1, 2]. The expression levels 
are  the  overall  results  of  the  transcriptional  and  post-tr-
anscriptional regulations [1, 3]. Codon usage bias usually 
refers to different frequencies of synonymous codons attri-
buted to one specific amino acid [4, 5]. Synonymous codons 
translate with different speeds; an event which indicates that 
the translational efficiency may be specifically modified by 
using  different  codons  [6].  Furthermore,  in  some  proka-
ryotes and eukaryotes, amino acid content is also known to 
be related with gene expression level [7]. Two major factors 
including natural selection and mutational bias are reported 
to  explain  such  codon  and  amino  acid  usage  bias  [8]. 
However, this relationship, as proposed by the translation 
selection model, is less evident in mammals.

There is a clear relation between the expression levels of 
genes and codon composition in most organisms [5]. None-
theless, due to tissue-specific gene expression, identification 
of factors affecting gene expression in multicellular orga-
nisms is much more complicated [9]. Thus, some studies 
have focused on the relation between tissue specific gene 
expression and compositional features of the genes. Sémon 
et al. [10] reported that selective pressure influenced the 
synonymous  codon  usage  of  human  tissue-specific  genes 
and modify the expression of special proteins. Also, Zhou et 
al.  [9]  identified  some  significant  correlations  between 
tissues  specific  oncogenes  and  sequence  compositional 
features in human tissues. Then, Hajjari et al. [11] found that 
the  structural  elements  in  tumor  suppressor  genes  and 
proteins  can  play  important  roles  in  their  regulation. 
However, it is still unclear whether translational selection 
affects other human genes specifically based on their tissue 
expression patterns [12].

Apoptosis,  the  process  of  programmed  cell  death,  is 
considered  as  a  crucial  component  of  different  processes 
such as normal cell cycle, development, and function of the 
immunity  system  [13].  Different  genes  controlling  the 
apoptosis process have been identified. Since the expression 
levels of genes involved in apoptosis are different in human 
tissues, we aimed to find if the compositional features of 
these genes are involved in their regulation. Considering the 
important  role  of  these  genes  in  cellular  and  molecular 
function,  the  results  may  provide  new  clues  about  their 
tissue specific regulation. Since the dysregulation of these 
genes is a common event in some diseases especially cancers, 
the unraveling different mechanisms of their regulation may 
also reveal novel strategies for therapeutic intervention.

In  this  study,  we  tried  to  elucidate  the  potential  cor-
relation between some compositional features of genes/pro-
teins structures and their expression level in some human 
tissues. The results may reveal the support for the relation 
between codon usage, amino acid usage and tissue specific 
gene expression. 

Methods
Sequence retrieval, alignments, and expression data 
acquisition

The list of apoptosis involved genes coding proteins with 
different molecular functions and localizations in the cell 
were  drawn  from  the  Deathbase  (http://deathbase.org/) 
(Supplementary Table 1). In order to minimize the statistical 
errors, multiple alignments were performed for the seque-
nces  by  ClustalW  program  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk),  and 
finally, 65 genes were selected for our study. Normalized 
expressions of genes were directly drawn from SOURCE, 
2014 (Stanford Microarray) database (Source.stanford.edu) 
(Supplementary Table 1). The normalized gene expression in 
this database presents the relative expression level of a gene 
(defined as a UniGene Cluster) in different tissues and is 
“normalized” for the number of clones from each tissue that 
are included in UniGene (http://source-search.princeton.edu/ 
help/SOURCE/normalization.html). This database links to 
the microarray experiments that included the queried genes. 
Thirty four different tissues were selected and in each tissue, 
the average expression level, the number of expressed genes, 
and the highest expressed gene were recognized. 

Sequence compositional features

The  codon  usage  table  of  Homo  sapiens  was  obtained 
(http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/), and used to calculate Codon 
Adaptation  Index  (CAI)  (http://genomes.urv.es/CAIcal/) 
for  each  coding  domain  sequence  (CDS).  The  tRNA 
Adaptation  Index  (tAI)  was  also  measured  for  each  CDS 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

using Visual Gene Developer 1.4 Build 750. The frequencies 
per thousand of all of 61 codons were calculated for all 65 
CDSs  by  Countcodon  program  (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/ 
codon/countcodon.html). Also, The Relative Synonymous 
Codon  Usage  (RSCU)  of  all  amino  acids  was  measured 
(http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/codon_usage) for all 
desired proteins.

Amino acid sequence characteristics

The protein sequences of all 65 genes were obtained from 
NCBI Resource Portal. Then, the percentage of each amino 
acid  was  obtained  for  all  of  the  proteins  using  Protein 
Information Resource (http://pir.georgetown.edu).

Statistical analyses

For each tissue, the correlation between gene expression 
level  of  desired  genes  and  compositional  features  of 
CDS/protein was analyzed by Graphpad. p-values less than 
0.01  were  considered  as  significant.  However,  in  some 
tissues, because of lacking the p-value less than 0.01, we 
considered the characteristics with p-values less than 0.05 as 
the most significant features. Finally, in order to determine 
truly  significant  features,  false  discovery  rate  (FDR)  was 
analyzed through the FDR online calculator (http://www. 
sdmproject.com/utilities/?show=FDR)  which  its  method 
coincides  with  the  R  code  of  the  version  proposed  by 
Benjamini and Hochberg.

significant.

Results
Correlation between gene compositional features 
and expression level

The correlation analyses showed that the gene compo-
sitional features are associated with the expression levels of 
desired  genes.  The  results  indicated  that  the  expression 
levels have significant correlation with the frequencies of 
some  codons  such  as  AAG  (in  20  tissues),  AUC  (in  17 
tissues), and GAC (in 12 tissues) (Supplementary Table 2). 
Among  these  codons,  AAG  and  AUC  showed  the  most 
significant correlation coefficients. In order to identify the 
tissues  in  which  both  AAG  and  AUC  have  significant 
correlations with the gene expression level, a bar plot was 
drawn by R software for these codons (Fig. 1). In Supple-
mentary  Table  2,  we  can  see  that  the  most  frequent  and 
attributed tRNAs are attributed to the AAG-Lys, AUC-Ile 
and GAC-Asn codons. 

Furthermore, our data showed that the expression levels 
of  apoptosis  genes  have  significant  correlations  with  the 
relative  synonymous  codon  usage  features  such  as  CCC 
(Prolin) and TCC (Serine) (Supplementary Table 3). Since 
the  aforementioned  codons  have  the  most  significant 
correlation coefficients, a bar plot was drawn by R software 
for these features in order to identify the tissues in which 
both codons have significant  correlation coefficients  with 
gene expression (Fig. 2).

To find the level of codon bias, CAI for each gene was 
measured.  We  found  some  correlations  between  these 
parameters and the expression level of desired genes in 8 

tissues  (p  ＜ 0.05).  Furthermore,  we  calculated  the  tAI, 
which is a measure of the tRNA usage by coding sequences. 
Significant correlations between tAI and the expression level 
of genes were reported in 20 tissues (Supplementary Table 
4). Also, the results indicated that nucleotide compositional 
features  (including  CG  percent  in  codon  bases)  have 
significant correlations with gene expression levels in some 
tissues (Supplementary Table 4).

Correlation between protein compositional features 
and the expression levels

Our data indicated that different amino acids including 
Arg,  Asp,  Lys,  Glu,  Gln,  Ser,  and  Ile  have  significant 
correlations with the expression level of genes in 15, 14, 12, 
11, 11, 9, and 8 tissues respectively (Supplementary Table 5). 
Among these notable amino acids, Asp and Lys have the 
most significant positive correlation coefficients. So, a bar 
plot was drawn by R software for these amino acids in order 
to  identify  the  tissues  in  which  both  Asp  and  Lys  have 
significant  correlation  coefficients  with  gene  expression 
level (Fig. 3).

Most significant and truly significant features in 
different tissues

In order to find out which feature has the most significant 
correlation  with  the  gene  expression  level  in  different 
tissues, the features with the least p-value were recognized 
(Table 1, Fig. 4). Also, since multiple correlations were done 
in the current study, the FDR analysis was done to decrease

(serine) have the most significant correlation coefficients with gene
expression  levels.  The  bar  plot  is  drawn  by  R  statistical  software. 
p  ＜ 0.05  is  considered  statistically  significant.

the statistical errors (Table 2). Through this analysis, we 
calculated  the  corrected  p-values  in  order  to  find  truly 
significant feature. By FDR analysis, we found some truly 
significant features such as AAG (coding lysine) and GAC 
(coding aspartate) codons (drawn from codon frequencies), 
lysine and aspartate (drawn from amino acid frequencies), 
and CTCL (from synonymous codon usage features) which 
are common among some tissues (Table 2). 

Discussion

The  relation  between  the  expression  level  and  the 
gene/protein compositional features has been reported in 
different organisms [5]. However, little is known about the 
factors affecting the tissue specific gene expression level in 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

multicellular organisms [9]. In the last years, the effects of 
codon  bias  and  other  compositional  features  on  the 
tissue-specific  translational  control  of  genes  have  been 
reported [1, 11]. In the current study, in order to elucidate 
this  level  of  regulation  on  the  expression  of  apoptosis 
involved  genes,  we  investigated  the  relation  between  the 
gene expression and structural features. The results can help 
us understand the molecular mechanism and regulation of 
this type of genes. Our data suggest that synonymous codon 
usage  in human  genes may not  be  the  result of isochore 
organization of the genome or neutral evolutionary processes 
as well. We found some common features correlated with 
gene  expression  in  different  tissues,  a  finding  that  may 
indicate  common  mechanisms  in  gene  regulation.  The 
current results suggest several hypotheses about the me-
chanisms  of  gene  regulation  and  tissue  differentiation  in 
human. 

There are some  reports indicating  that codon  usage  in 
mammals  has  notable  effects  on  translation  rate  [14], 
especially  during  cell  differentiation  [15].  The  systematic 
tissue-specific codon usage may indicate that human tissues 
can  differ  in  the  relative  tRNA  amount  [16].  This  may 
influence  on  the  expression  of  the  desired  proteins.  The 
significant  correlation  between  gene  expression  level  and 
some  codon  frequencies  especially  AAG  codon  (truly 
significant in nine tissues) may indicate the importance of 
the abundance of attributed tRNAs pairing with this codon. 
The correlation between gene expression and frequency of 
AAG codon was interestingly approved in a previous study 
by Hajjari et al. [11] on Tumor suppressor genes. 

Our  data  can  support  the  Plotkin  et  al.’s  study  on 
synonymous  codon  usage  features  [3].  Our  data  on  the 
significant correlations between tAI and expression levels of 
genes may support this hypothesis. The relation between 
synonymous codon usage bias and gene expression levels 
might be the result of the weak selection on synonymous 
sites which generate translationally optimal codons [17, 18]. 
Among our data, the correlation between the synonymous 
codon usage of leucin and gene expression level is of noted. 
In a similar study on tumor suppressor genes, this type of 
correlation was also observed [11]. So, these data altogether 
may indicate the importance of synonymous codon usage of 
Leucine  in  the  structure  of  genes.  Altogether,  some 
correlations  between  relative  synonymous  codon  usage, 
codon frequency, tAI, CAI, and gene expression show that 
there may be a translational selection on apoptosis involved 
genes. Since some of these features are common between 
different tissues, we assume that common mechanisms may 
be  involved  in  some  specific  tissues  in  this  level  of 
regulation. 

Some  previous  studies  declare  that  the  amino  acid

composition of proteins varies with increasing levels of gene 
expression in different tissues [19-21]. This result might 
suggest translational selection at the amino acid level. Based 
on this, the amino acids that are used more frequently in 
highly  expressed  genes  may  correspond  to  the  most 
abundant tRNAs [19, 22]. Furthermore, some studies also 
demonstrate  that  amino  acid  composition  is  affected  by 
selection  to  decrease  the  metabolic  cost  of  protein 

production [23]. In this study, we showed tissue specific 
correlations between amino acid usage and expression levels 
of apoptosis genes. Altogether, it may be inferred that the 
content of amino acids in tissues are very important for the 
regulation  of  the  expression  level  of  apoptosis  involved 
genes.  According  to  our  results,  some  amino  acids  have 
tissue specific correlations with the expression of apoptosis 
genes.  Our  results  showed  that  different  amino  acids

including Arg, Asp, Lys, Glu, Gln, Ser, and Ile have significant 
correlations with the expression level of genes in 15, 14, 12, 
11, 11, 9, and 8 tissues respectively (Supplementary Table 5). 
If we consider all of the codons attributed to one specific 
amino acid in one group for correlation analysis, we also get 
the same correlation coefficient and p-value as the amino 
acid features. So, all of the codons of arginine including CGT, 
CGA, CGC, CGG, AGA, and AGG (as one group) has the 
significant  correlation  with  gene  expression  level.  Some 
previous studies have demonstrated the role of these amino 
acids in apoptosis progression [24, 25]. So, it seems that the 
concentration of these amino acids in specific cell types can 
play an important role in cell survival and apoptosis.

Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential trans-
lational selection on sequence features of human apoptosis 
genes. Our data support the previous studies performed by 
Hajjari et al. [11] and Zhou et al. [9] who showed that the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

expression  of  cancer  involved  genes  are  correlated  with 
compositional  features  in  different  human  tissues.  The 
current findings have implications for the optimal design of 
gene therapies targeted in specific tissues and will promote 
a better biological understanding of translational selection of 
tissue specific gene expression in human.
