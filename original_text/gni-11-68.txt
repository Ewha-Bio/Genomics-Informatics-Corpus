Anaplastic  thyroid  cancer  (ATC)  belongs  to  the  most  malignant  and  rapidly  progressive  human  thyroid  cancers  and  its 
prognosis is very poor. Also, it shows high resistance to cancer treatments, so that effective treatment for ATC has not been 
found to date, and virtually all patients terminate their life rapidly after diagnosis. Although targeted treatment of genetic 
alterations has emerged as an extremely promising approach to human cancers, such as BRAF in metastatic melanoma, it 
remains unclear that how commonly genomic alterations are influenced in ATC tumorigenesis. In recent years, genome wide 
approaches have been exploited to find genetic alterations associated with complex diseases, including cancer. Here, we 
reviewed  the  comprehensive  genetic  alterations  in  ATC  and  recent  approaches  in  the  context  of  identifying  genomic 
alterations associated with ATC. Since surprisingly few reports have been published on the genome wide study of ATC, this 
review puts emphasis on the urgent needs of genomic research for the prevention and treatment of ATC.

Introduction

Thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer worldwide 
[1]. Especially, in Korea, the average annual incidence rates 
of thyroid cancer in 2010 was 17.8% recording the highest 
increasing rate among all cancers (National Cancer Infor-
Mation  Center;  http://www.cancer.go.kr/).  Thyroid  car-
cinomas can be sub-classified according to their histological 
and clinical features such as cellular origins or prognosis [2]. 
The most common subtype of thyroid cancers are papillary 
thyroid  cancer  (PTC;  80%  to  85%)  and  follicular  thyroid 
cancer (FTC; 10% to 25%), which are differentiated tumors 
derived from follicular epithelial cells. Poorly differentiated 
thyroid cancer (PDTC; 5% to 10%) and anaplastic thyroid 
cancer (ATC; 2% to 3%) are also derived from follicular cells. 
Parafollicular  C  cell-derived  medullary  thyroid  cancer 
(MTC) comprises 2-3% of all thyroid cancers [2, 3]. The 
overall survival rates for PTC (98%), FTC (92%), and MTC 
(80%) are high [4], and these types have a more favorable 
prognosis by multimodality treatment. However, ATC has an 
almost  typically  rapid  and  lethal  progression,  and  the 
survival rate for ATC is only 13% [4] or 1-17% [2] with a 

mean  survival  of  6  months  after  diagnosis  [5].  Although 
ATC  supposed  to  be  a  follicular-cell-derived  cancer,  and 
represents a terminal stage in the dedifferentiation of PTC or 
FTC [6], the molecular mechanisms underlying ATC are not 
clear. Because ATC is rare disease, it has been difficult to 
obtain  sufficient  samples  to  study  the  mechanism  of  the 
tumorigenesis associated with ATC which should have great 
impact to survival and treatment of patients [7]. Here, we 
reviewed the recent progress of the identification of genetic 
and  epigenetic  changes  in  ATC,  focusing  especially  on 
genomic  study.  By  this  effort,  we  may  clarify  the  further 
substances  of  genomic  research  to  conquer  the  most 
aggressive type of thyroid carcinomas.

Functional and Frequent Mutations in ATC

To date, a considerable number of genetic mutations have 
been identified that play roles in the tumorigenesis of ATC, 
mainly by traditional approaches (Table 1) [8-13]. The most 
well-known  mutation  of  thyroid  cancer  is  BRAFV600E, 
occurring in approximately 26% of ATCs and 45% of PTCs 
[8, 14]. The BRAFV600E mutant protein is produced by the

point mutation of T1799A coding sequence, and as conse-
quence the BRAF kinase shows constitutive activity [15-18]. 
Its  oncogenic  and  transforming  capability  has  been  well 
studies [19] and interestingly, it is strongly associated with 
poor  prognosis  of  PTC,  including  aggressive  pathological 
characteristics,  increased  recurrence  rates,  and  failure  of 

treatment [20, 21]. 

The tumor suppressor gene p53 is commonly mutated in 
ATC [8] but uncommon in well-differentiated PTC and FTC. 
For  example,  Donghi  et  al.  [22]  reported  that  p53  was 
mutated in approximately 71% of undifferentiated thyroid 
cancers  (UDTC).  Also  Fagin  et  al.  [23]  reported  83%

mutation rate of p53 in ATCs, and Quiros et al. [24] found 
88%  of  p53  mutation  in  ATC  patients  using  immunohis-
tochemical analysis . 

RAS  mutations  were  detected  rarely  in  PTC,  but  more 
prevalently in FTC and ATC [25], as if there are relationship 
between  RAS mutations and the aggressiveness of tumor 
behavior  and/or  poor  prognosis  [26,  27].  From  three 
members of RAS family (HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS), codon 
12/13 of KRAS mutation is known to be associated with poor 
survival  for  more  aggressive  subtype  of  thyroid  tumors, 
including ATC [26]. RAS is known as an important regulator 
of cell growth, differentiation and survival of thyroid cancer 
[28]. In tumorigenesis, RAS may mediate multiple trans-
duction signaling pathways such as Raf-MAPK and phospha-
tidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways [29]. 

Mutations  of  PIK3CA  are  also  common  in  ATC  [8]. 
PIK3CA encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K and 
PI3K, in turns, involves in the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway, 
which  regulates  several  cellular  processes,  including  cell 
cycle  progression,  adhesion  and  motility.  Especially,  this 
pathway linked to the cell survival, angiogenesis and glucose 
homeostasis which are important for tumorigenesis [30]. 
Garcia-Rostan  et  al.  [30]  showed  that  the  missense 
mutations of PIK3CA are higher in ATC than in others such 
as  well-differentiated  thyroid  cancer.  Additionally,  ATC 
patients who had mutated PIK3CA showed also Ras or BRAF 
alterations .

Garcia-Rostan et al. [31, 32] demonstrated the significant 
association of mutations in β-catenin and the change of its 
expression with  poor  prognosis  of  ATC.  They found  that 
activating mutations of CTNNB1, β-catenin encoding gene, 
often cause the activation of WNT-β-catenin signaling. In 
general, as an ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein, 
β-catenin  is  a  downstream  signaling  molecule  in  Wnt 
pathway,  and  known  to  have  a  crucial  role  in  cell-cell 
adhesion mediated by E-cadherin. Interestingly, when it is 
upregulated, the nuclear translocation is occurred so that the 
transcription  of  various  tumor-promoting  genes  could  be 
triggered. Axin 1 is a scaffold protein and located in chro-
mosome 16p13.3. It is supposed to be a tumor suppressor 
and play a role also in the Wnt pathway. Kurihara et al. [33] 
found the mutation of Axin 1 in 81.8% of 22 Japanese ATC 
samples. Together, the genetic alterations of genes in the 
Wnt  signaling  pathway  are  found  frequently  with  ATC 
suggesting  the  important  role  of  Wnt  pathway  for  ATC 
tumorigenesis.

Although the mutation prevalence is not high, mutations 
in the gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) have been 
recently identified in ATC [9, 34]. The overall prevalence of 
mutations of IDH1 was reported as 11% in 18 ATC samples 
by Murugan et al. [9]. Murugan and Xing [10] reported two 

novel point mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK) gene, C3592T and G3602A, with a prevalence of 25% 
in 8 ATC tumor samples. ALK, one of the receptor tyrosine 
kinases, is a member of insulin receptor subfamily and these 
transverse point mutations caused the amino acid changes 
L1198F and G1201E, followed by increase of tyrosine kinase 
activities.  Initially,  ALK  was  identified  as  an  oncogeneic 
fusion gene NPM1-ALK in anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma [35]. Further, fusion gene EML4-ALK was found 
in  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  [36]  and  TMP3/4-ALK  and 
RANBP2-ALK in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors [37]. 
They  were  aberrantly  activated  and  promoted  cell  proli-
feration and survival [38, 39].

Although these mutations have been reported to date, it is 
not  clear  what  of  those  are  the  driver  mutations  of  ATC 
development or if there is any. Also, many other mutations 
and  genes  might  be  associated  with  ATC  tumorigenesis, 
which may contribute a lot to the diagnosis and treatment of 
ATC. Therefore, it is a natural consequence that scientists try 
to adapt genomic approaches to analyze the mechanism of 
ATC in very recent years.

Chromosomal Aberrations in ATC

Hemmer et al. [12] studied DNA copy number changes by 
comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH)  in  69  primary 
thyroid carcinomas including 13 ATC patients. From those 
11 ATC cases, showed chromosomal changes (10 gains, 3 
deletions, both in 2 cases). Regions of frequent gains were 
mainly  located  in  7p22-pter,  8q22-qter,  and  9q34-qter 
regions in 31%, 23% and 23% of ATC cases, respectively. The 
known proto-oncogenes such as PDGR-α, myc and ABL1, 
and VAVZ are located, in these regions but still no functional 
evidences  were  found  supporting  the  association  of  copy 
number changes of these regions and the aggressiveness of 
ATC. Also, Rodrigues et al. [40] examined 39 thyroid cancer 
patients  including  7  ATCs.  All  cases  of  ATC  presented 
chromosomal  imbalances,  especially,  they  found  gains  at 
chromosome 20p and 20q, and losses of Xp in 6 cases of 
ATC, and gains at 3q and 5p in 5 cases ATC. Some important 
genes  included  PI3K,  BCL6,  and  SST  at  3q;  invasion  and 
metastases genes (MMP9 and MMP24), a cell cycle and mito-
tic checkpoint gene (STK15) at 20q. The loss of tumor sup-
pressor gene related 7q31 was detected. The chromosomal 
instability  of  ATC  revealed  as  significantly  higher  than 
well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) or PDTC when 
compared the CGH-detectable abnormalities as reported by 
couple of studies [12, 40].

Kitamura et al. [41] detected allelic losses using 21 ATC 
patient  samples  in  1q  (40%),  9p  (58%),  11p  (33%),  11q 
(33%), 17p (44%), 17q (43%), 19p (36%), and 22q (38%).

Wreesmann et al. [13] reported the unique gains at chro-
mosome  3p13-14  and  11q13  (where  the  cyclin  D1  and 
FOSL1 located) and losses at 5q11-31 in ATC patients. 

Liu et al. [11] found frequent copy number gains in many 
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes containing the EGFR, 
PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, KIT, MET, PIK3Ca, 
PIK3Cb,  and  PDK1  genes.  Many  of  the  genes  with  copy 
number gains are known to be proto-oncogenes so that they 
may  be  play  a  important  role  in  ATC  tumorigenesis  by 
increasing the protein level followed by aberrant activation 
of the oncogenic pathway. The prevalence of copy number 
gains was generally higher in ATC than differentiated thy-
roid cancer [42], also as mentioned in other studies. It is 
supposed that the copy number variations, which could be 
occurred  by  chromosomal  amplification  or  instability, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  2,  2013

should be important and involved to the progression and 
aggressiveness of ATC [43]. 

Chromosomal  alteration  could  cause  the  genomic  re-
arrangements  and  fusion  genes.  In  PTC,  rearrangement 
causing  RET/PTC  fusion  gene  was  observed  often,  but  it 
rarely  occur  in  benign  follicular  thyroid  adenoma  and 
follicular variant PTC  [44]. Liu et al. [11] reported the same 
RET/PTC  rearrangement  in  3  cases  of  ATC  tissues,  but 
because some ATC tissues contained PTC tissues, they were 
suspicious  to  their  result.  Therefore,  if  chromosomal 
rearrangement and fusion genes, including RET/PTC fusion, 
involve  to  the  ATC  progression,  should  be  investigated 
further.

Expression Analysis in ATC by Microarray

Although  not  many  investigations  for  genome  wide 
expression  analysis  were  performed,  several  studies 
examined altered expression of genes in ATC cell lines or 
patient samples using microarray (Table 2) [45-50]. The up- 
and downregulated genes in ATC identified as players in the 
regulation  of  important  cellular  functions  which  may 
influencing to the tumorigenesis. Onda et al. [45] found 31 
over- and 56 under-expressed genes using 11 ATC cell lines 
compared with normal thyroid gland; then they validated 
these  data  with  10  ATC  patient  samples,  among  them, 
DSTN,  HSPA8,  Stathmin,  LDH-A,  ATP5A1,  PSM  B6,  B23, 
HDP-1, and LDH-B were significantly upregulated in primary 
ATC patient samples. On the other hand, TG, PBP, and FES 
were downregulated in primary ATC tissues compared with 
normal  thyroid  glands.  In  other  study  of  ATC  cell  lines, 
Akaishi  et  al.  [50]  identified  transmembrane  protein  34 
(TMEM34) as specifically downregulated gene. 

Although it is not a microarray analysis, Passon et al. [46] 
measured  mRNA  levels  for  CREM,  PAX8,  and  NIS  in  6 
normal thyroid tissues, 22 PTCs, 12 FTCs, and 4 ATCs using 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Compared 
to  normal  tissues,  NIS  and  PAX8  mRNA  levels  were 
significantly reduced in all types of thyroid cancer, especially 
in ATCs. Conversely, CREM mRNA levels were increased in 
all types of thyroid cancer including ATC.

To  find  molecular  profile  related  to  poor  prognosis  of 
thyroid cancer, Montero-Conde et al. [47] examined 7 ATC, 
6  PDTC,  24  PTC  and  7  FTC  tissues  by  microarray.  They 
comprised  13  dedifferentiated  thyroid  cancer  (ATC  and 
PDTC) vs. 31 WDTC (PTC and FTC) tissues. In this data, 
they  found  that  1,031  genes  showed  more  than  2-fold 
changes of its expression in absolute values. Interestingly, 
pathways which are known to associated with tumorigenesis 
were preferentially altered in ATC and PDTC tissues; the 
MAP  kinase  signaling  pathway,  the  transforming  growth 
factor-β signaling pathway, focal adhesion and cell motility, 
activation  of  actin  polymerization, and  cell  cycle.  UBE2C, 
S100A4, and STK5 were significantly overexpressed in ATC 
and  PDTC  than  WDTC.  CDH1,  TG,  and  PAX8  were 
significantly underexpressed in ATC and PDTC than WDTC, 
of  those  the  down  regulation  of  TG  and  PAX8  were  also 
reported by Onda et al. [45] and Passon et al. [46]. 

In other study, Pallante et al. [48], reported downregu-
lation of CBX7 expression using microarray analysis in vari-
ous  thyroid carcinoma-derived  cell  lines.  Then,  they  vali-
dated this finding in various thyroid tissue samples. They 
show  that  CBX7  expression  decreased  with  malignancy 
grade cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Interestingly, in 
same study, CBX7 loss of heterozygosity occurred in 36.8% 

(7 of 19 cases) of PTCs and in 68.7% (11 of 16 cases) of 
ATCs. mRNA for CDKN2A/p16 which is the molecular target 
of  CBX7  and  known  to  be  a  tumor  suppressor,  was  also 
highly expressed.

As direct study of patient samples, Salvatore et al. [49] did 
a microarray analysis using 5 ATC compared with 10 PTC 
and 4 normal thyroid tissue and validated their data with 
further 22 ATC, 39 PTC and 19 normal thyroid samples. 914 
genes distinguished ATC from normal tissue: and only 114 
genes were found to discriminated normal thyroid from both 
PTC and ATC. Especially, 54 genes were upregulated in ATC 
and  they  are  largely  involved  in  cell  cycle  progression  or 
chromosome  instability.  Among  them,  TOP2A,  CDC20, 
CENPA,  NEK2,  PRC1,  CCNB1,  CDCA8,  TTK,  CENPF,  and 
PLK1 expression was ATC-specifically up-regulated. 

Taken together, the previous studies of genomic expres-
sion  analysis  suggested  some  of  interesting  genes  and 
molecular  changes  using  microarray,  they  could  not  find 
clearly the major driver genes or pathways for ATC tumo-
rigenesis. This may be due to the hardness of sample collec-
tion or ATC itself could have a very complex heterogeneity. 
But the technical limitation of microarray itself may cont-
ribute also largely. The recently applicable next generation 
sequencing technology could help to solve this issue so that 
the molecular contribution of gene expression changes for 
ATC could be resolved.

Epigenetic Alterations in ATC

Since the epigenetic changes of tumor-associated genes 
are  known  to  play  important  role  and  have  physiological 
function in the development of various human cancers and 
its  progression  [51,  52],  they  may  also  influence  to  the 
tumorigenesis of the most malignant form of thyroid cancer, 
ATC.  In  PTC  cells,  genome-wide  hypermethylation  was 
found by a recent study using DNA methylation microarray 
which is revealed to be driven by BRAFV600E signaling [53]. 
Other  couple  of  papers  focused  more  to  the  change  of 
methylation  pattern in  ATC.  Schagdarsurengin et al. [54] 
analyzed the methylation pattern of 17 gene promoters in 
ATC, included those involved in DNA damage avoidance and 
repair (MGMT, GSTP1), apoptosis (DAPK, UCHL1), cell cycle 
control (p16, RB), tumor invasion and metastasis (TIMP3, 
CD26),  hormone  response  (RARβ,  ERα,  ERβ),  signal 
transduction  (PTEN,  RASSF1A),  regulation  of  thyrocyte 
function and growth (TSHR), and other tumor-associated 
genes (DLC1, SLC5A8). Among these genes, they found that 
TSHR,  MGMT,  UCHL1,  p16,  and  DAPK  were  frequently 
methylated in ATC.

PTEN, as a well-established tumor suppressor, is involved 
in the PI3K/AKT pathway. Hou et al. [55] found that PTEN

methylation is necessary to progress the malignancy from 
benign thyroid adenoma to FTC and aggressive ATC. The 
methylation of a gene is usually associated with its silencing 
and  the  increased  methylation  of  PTEN  in  ATC  is  in 
concordance with decreased or even lack of PTEN expression 
in  previous  reports  [56,  57].  They  also  found  that  PTEN 
methylation in thyroid tumors was closely associated with 
the activating genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, 
including mutations in Ras, PIK3CA, PTEN gene and PIK3CA 
amplification [55]. 

Four microRNAs (miRs) (-30d, -125b, -26a, and 30a-5p) 
were  reported  by  Visone  et  al.  [58]  as  decreased  in  ATC 
compared with normal thyroid tissue. From these, miR-26a 
and -125b may be targeting HMGA1 and HMGA2 which are 
known to be involved in thyroid cell transformation [59]. In 
other report by Mitomo et al. [60], found the upregulation of 
miRs-21, -146b, -221, and -222 and downregulation of -26a, 
-138, -219, and -345 in thyroid cancer. From these, miR-21 
targets  E2F  (involved  in  cell  cycle  and  apoptosis)  and 
inhibits PTEN. Interestingly, miR-138 which was found to 
be downregulated in both study of Visonet’s and Mitomo’s 
group [58, 60], targets hTERT which is also found to be 
reduced.  Takakura  et  al.  [61]  identified  ATC  specifically 
deregulated  miRNAs  in  ATC  cell  line.  They  found  that 
overexpression  of  miR-17-92  cluster  of  7  miRNAs  (miR- 
17-3p, -17-5p, -18a, -19a, -19b, -20a, and -92-1), which has 
a  crucial  role  in  cell  growth  and  survival.  Additionally, 
miR-17-3p and -17-5p 5p were overexpressed in 3 out of the 
6 ATC patient samples.

Conclusion

Although ATC is known to be one of the most aggressive 
tumor types, there has been little progress in the diagnosis 
and  treatment,  largely  due  to  the  shortage  of  genetic 
information  associated  with  the  molecular  mechanism  of 
ATC  tumorigenesis.  In  this  review,  we  discussed  genetic 
alterations, structural variations, and epigenetic changes of 
ATC performed by many scientists to date. As shown, only 
limited information is available, and few studies were per-
formed  using  genome-based  approaches.  Generally,  the 
quantities and qualities of samples for genomic study are 
very high, so that it is not easy to fulfill the requirements. 
Therefore, collecting a sufficient number of samples for ATC 
matching  these  criteria  is  a  kind  of  challenge  for  many 
scientists.  However,  current  next-generation  sequencing 
techniques  require  smaller  amounts  of  samples  and  are 
applicable  for  less-qualified  samples  but  provide  more 
accurate results for researchers to evaluate diverse genetic 
alterations. 

Recently, the technical advances of genome study devel-

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  2,  2013

oped explosively so that it could provide more comprehen-
sive  information  on  cancer  genomics,  especially  for  gene 
expression, sequence variations, copy number changes, and 
epigenetic changes [62]. Using such technology such as next 
generation sequencing and big data, rapid progress has been 
realized in many parts of cancer molecular biology, which in 
turn contributes to the development of early diagnosis tools 
and/or  targeted  molecular  therapies.  Thus,  less-detailed 
cancer  types  have  been  intensively  targeted  by  current 
genomic studies. For example, many studies have analyzed 
the  genomic  alterations  associated  with  lung  cancer  and 
reported  detailed  molecular  events  that  could  be  used 
directly in the clinic, such as selection of the most effective 
drug for each patient. For thyroid cancer, The Cancer Geno-
me Atlas (TCGA) has deposited the analysis results of -500 
thyroid cancer genomes in their public website, which may 
be published very soon. These analyses will provide a more 
detailed,  multidimensional  genomic  characterization  of 
thyroid cancer genomes. However, most of the 500 thyroid 
cancer genomes in TCGA were only from PTC patients, and 
none was from an ATC patient.

It is clear that genomic study of ATC is urgently needed so 
that the molecular mechanisms of ATC and the genetic and 
epigenetic  changes  in  ATC  could  be  more  preciously 
understand. Studies on ATC-associated genetic alterations, 
such as mutations and aberrant structural and epigenetic 
changes,  based  on  genomic  approaches  should  help  to 
elucidate the molecular consequences of the activation of 
oncogenes and the loss of tumor suppressors to improve our 
understanding of tumor biology in ATC. Especially, using 
recently developmed NGS technology, we will get a deep 
understanding of ATC-specific molecular mechanisms for 
successful  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  this  aggressive 
cancerand  further  facilitate  the  search  for  prognostic  and 
predictive  markers  and  new  therapeutic  targets  for 
personalized medicine.
