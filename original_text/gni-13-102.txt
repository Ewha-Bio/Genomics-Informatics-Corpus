The karyotypes of most species of crocodilians were studied using conventional and molecular cytogenetics. These provided 
an important contribution of chromosomal rearrangements for the evolutionary processes of Crocodylia and Sauropsida 

(birds and reptiles). The karyotypic features of crocodilians contain small diploid chromosome numbers (30∼42), with little 
interspecific variation of the chromosome arm number (fundamental number) among crocodiles (56∼60). This suggested 

that  centric  fusion  and/or  fission  events  occurred  in  the  lineage,  leading  to  crocodilian  evolution  and  diversity.  The 
chromosome numbers of Alligator, Caiman, Melanosuchus, Paleosuchus, Gavialis, Tomistoma, Mecistops, and Osteolaemus 
were stable within each genus, whereas those of Crocodylus (crocodylians) varied within the taxa. This agreed with molecular 
phylogeny that suggested a highly recent radiation of Crocodylus species. Karyotype analysis also suggests the direction of 
molecular phylogenetic placement among Crocodylus species and their migration from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and The 

New World. Crocodylus species originated from an ancestor in the Indo-Pacific around 9∼16 million years ago (MYA) in the 
mid-Miocene, with a rapid radiation and dispersion into Africa 8∼12 MYA. This was followed by a trans-Atlantic dispersion 
to the New World between 4∼8 MYA in the Pliocene. The chromosomes provided a better understanding of crocodilian 

evolution and diversity, which will be useful for further study of the genome evolution in Crocodylia.

Introduction

Crocodilians (Crocodylia) are extant large-sized reptiles 
found throughout the tropics in freshwater lakes, rivers, and 
oceans. Crocodilians diverged from birds, their closest living 
relatives as Archosauromorpha more than 240 million years 
ago (MYA). Ancestral crocodilian species first appeared in 
the fossil record around 80 MYA during the Late Cretaceous 
[1]. Extant crocodilians contain 25 species, classified into 
two  families:  Alligatoridae  (comprising  genera:  Alligator, 
Caiman,  Paleosuchus,  and  Melanosuchus)  and  Crocodylidae 
(comprising  genera:  Gavialis,  Tomistoma,  Mecistops,  Osteo-
laemus, and Crocodylus) [2]. These crocodilians share both 
ancient and recent morphology as well as ecological chara-
cters [1]. The understanding of the phylogenetic history and 
biogeography in this lineage has provided a fascinating study 

for evolutionary biologists.

A phylogenetic approach for crocodilians was originally 
conducted based on fossil records. These suggested that the 
Indian gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) was a basal crocodilian 
[1];  however,  molecular  datasets  indicated  that  Alligator 
diverged  from  the  remaining  crocodilians  around  50∼70 
MYA in the Tertiary, of which Crocodylus are the most recent 
group (Fig. 1) [3-24]. This suggested that Alligator was the 
most  ancient  crocodilian;  however,  relationships  among 
living species of Crocodylus remain poorly resolved, since they 
radiated into various species around 9∼13 MYA during the 
middle of the Miocene [16]. These issues have received high 
priority in modern systematics by combining many datasets 
to  determine  the  true  groupings  and  divergences  among 
them. One possibility is the level of different chromosome 
constitution, though crocodilians exhibit slow divergence of 
karyotype among living species. However, various karyotypic

molecular  loci  (nuclear  and  mitochondrial  DNA)  (right)  with  regard  to  crocodilian  phylogeny,  divergence  time,  and  karyological  data.
The  majority-rule  tree  with  interval  node  ages  from  the  *BEAST  posterior  sample  is  conducted  based  on  a  conservative  upper  bound
of 100 million year ago (MYA), placed on the root of Crocodylia (83.5∼96.5 MYA) and on the divergence of Alligator-Caiman (64∼71 
MYA)  [1,  18]  (left  image).  The  phylogenetic  tree  within  Crocodylia  was  obtained  from  Oaks  [16]  with  slight  modification  (right  image).
Karyological  data  were  obtained  from  Cohen  and  Gans  [19],  Olmo  and  Signorio  [20],  Kawagoshi  et  al.  [21],  Srikulnath  et  al.  [22],  and
Kasai  et  al.  [23].  Estimated  divergence  times  at  individual  nodes  are  shown  with  their  interval  ages.  Crocodylus  siamensis  (1),  complete

Crocodylus lineage, Indo-Pacific species is Crocodylus mindorensis, Crocodylus novaeguineae, Crocodylus johnstoni, Crocodylus siamensis,
Crocodylus  palustris,  and  Crocodylus  porosus;  New  World  species  is  Crocodylus  moreletii,  Crocodylus  acutus,  Crocodylus  intermedius,
and  Crocodylus  rhombifer;  and  African  species  is  Crocodylus  niloticus.

forms in the lineage are probably the source of reproductive 
isolation, which eventually radiated into species diversity.

Remarkably,  chromosomal  investigation  of  23  crocodi-
lians  revealed  karyotypic  features:  small  diploid  chromo-
some numbers (30∼42), the predominance of a few large 
chromosomes,  and  the  absence  of  dot-shaped  micro-
chromosomes whose centromere positions are undetectable 
[19, 20]. This contradicts with the karyotypes of birds (the 
sister group of Archosauromorpha), and the relative lineage 
of  turtles,  which  contain  a  small  number  of  macro-
chromosomes  and  many  indistinguishable  microchromo-
somes  [20,  25].  The  increase  of  large  bi-armed  chromo-
somes  and  the  presence  of  small  chromosomes  probably 
correlate  with  the  reduction  of  medium  acrocentric 
chromosomes  and  the  absence  of  microchromosomes, 
respectively, in these lineages [25, 26]. The chromosome 
arm number or fundamental number (NF, bi-armed chromo-
some:  metacentric  or  submetacentric  =  2;  uni-armed 
chromosome:  acrocentric  or  subtelocentric  =  1)  of  all 
crocodilian  karyotypes  shows  little  interspecific  variation 
(56∼60),  and  no  sex  chromosome  heteromorphism  has 

been recognized in any species [19, 20, 27]. These chara-
cteristics of crocodilian karyotypes indicated that very few 
chromosomal rearrangements have occurred in Crocodylia, 
except for centric fusion and/or fission events. To delineate 
the role of chromosomal rearrangement, which also plays an 
evolutionary force in crocodilian diversity and evolution, the 
karyotype  data  and  phylogeny  were  summarized  as  (1) 
variation of chromosome constitution within crocodilians 
compared  to  other  sauropsids  (birds  and  reptiles),  (2) 
current phylogenetic history of crocodilians from molecular 
data and paleontological perspective, and (3) correlation of 
chromosomal rearrangements in each lineage and phylogeny 
in crocodilians. 

Comparative Genomics for Crocodilians and 
Other Sauropsids

Sauropsids  (birds  and  reptiles)  number  around  20,000 
species,  comprising  large  group  diversity  in  birds  (9,900 
species) and squamate reptiles (9,700 species), but small 
diversity  in  turtles  (340  species)  and  crocodilians  (25

species) [2]. It is possible that the species richness of birds 
and squamate reptiles correlates with the large karyotype 
variability.  By  contrast,  turtles  and  crocodiles  show  low 
chromosome constitution variability, although the correla-
tion  between  chromosome  changing  rate  and  species 
number is found in turtles, but not in crocodiles [20, 28-30]. 
This probably results from the role of sex chromosomes as all 
crocodilians  exhibit  temperature  sex  determination,  but 
both genetic sex determination (homomorphic and hetero-
morphic  sex  chromosomes)  and  temperature  sex  deter-
mination are found in other sauropsids (except for tuatara), 
leading to high speciation rate and species diversification 
[31]. 

The crocodilian karyotype contains few large and many 
small chromosomes, and there is an absence of dot-shaped 
microchromosomes [19, 20]. On the contrary, the karyo-
types of most squamate reptiles, tuatara, turtles, and birds 
contain macro- and microchromosomes [20]. Many chromo-
somal rearrangements might, therefore, be the result of the 
appearance or disappearance of microchromosomes, which 
reduced  whole-chromosome  homology  among  sauropsid 
chromosomes.  The  draft  genome  assemblies  of  chicken 
(Gallus  gallus),  Anolis  lizard  (Anolis  carolinensis),  Chinese 
alligator  (Alligator  sinensis),  American  alligator  (Alligator 
mississippiensis), saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus), In-
dian gharial (G. gangeticus), Burmese python (Python molurus 
bivittatus),  and  king  cobra  (Ophiophagus  hannah)  provided 
new perspectives on the comparative genomics of Saurop-
sida,  which  in  turn  facilitated  extensive  comparisons 
between genomic structures at a molecular level [32-37]. 
Recent  comparative  gene  mapping  of  several  sauropsid 
species (Pelodiscus sinensis, Testudines; Crocodylus siamensis, 
Crocodilia; Gekko hokouenesis, Lacerta agilis, Elaphe quadrivir-
gata,  Varanus  salvator  macromaculatus,  Leiolepis  reevesii  rubri-
taeniata, Pogona vitticeps, and A. carolinensis, Squamata) with 
those of chicken revealed the extensive homology between 
avian and reptilian chromosomes, and suggested that the 
common ancestor of amniotes may have had many micro-
chromosomes, whose linkages have been conserved among 
chickens and reptiles [25, 26, 33, 38-44]. Comparison of the 
linkage  homology  between  Archosauromorph  and  turtle 
chromosomes revealed that the macro- and microchromo-
somes of turtles are true counterparts of those of chicken 
[25, 26]. However, the comparative cytogenetic map of the 
Siamese  crocodile  (C.  siamensis),  i.e.,  the  first  cytogenetic 
map in the crocodilian lineage, revealed that genetic linkages 
of  large  chromosomes  were  also  conserved  in  blocks  on 
chromosome  arms  that  corresponded  to  chicken  macro-
chromosomal arms and/or entire macrochromosomes. The 
five largest bi-armed chromosomes of crocodile are derived 
by combinations of chromosome arms that differ from the 

chicken karyotype, while chicken microchromosomal genes 
are all localized to small chromosomes of the crocodile. This 
suggested  that  the  Siamese  crocodile  karyotype  resulted 
from two events that occurred in the crocodilian lineage: (1) 
centric  fissions  of  bi-armed  macrochromosomes  in  the 
ancestral  Archosauromorph-turtle  karyotype,  followed  by 
centric  fusions  between  acrocentric  macrochromosomes 
(new combination), leading to large chromosomes in croco-
dilians,  and  (2)  repeated  fusions  of  microchromosomes, 
which resulted in their disappearance and the appearance of 
a large number of small chromosomes [26]. 

Notably, chromosome size-dependent genomic compart-
mentalization is often found in birds and turtles but not in 
squamate reptiles, such as microchromosome-specific cent-
romere repetitive sequences [45-52]. This implied that the 
homogenization  of  centromeric  repetitive  sequences  bet-
ween  macro-  and  microchromosomes  did  not  predomi-
nantly occur in birds and turtles. However, no chromosome 
sized-specific centromeric repetitive sequences are found in 
crocodiles [21]. This suggested that chromosomal size-de-
pendent  genomic  compartmentalization  which  is  suppo-
sedly unique to Archosauromorph and turtles was probably 
lost with the disappearance of microchromosomes, followed 
by the homogenization of centromeric repetitive sequences 
among chromosomes in the crocodilian lineage after their 
divergence from birds around 240 MYA.

Chromosome  Constitution  in  Crocodilian 
Lineage

Diploid chromosome numbers in crocodilians range from 
30 to 42; most are 32 (Fig. 1) [19, 20]. Most karyotypes in 
crocodilians contain 4∼5 large bi-armed chromosomes, 20
∼22  small  bi-armed  chromosomes,  and  4∼8  uni-armed 
chromosomes.  However,  genome  rearrangements  among 
members in the order rarely occurred, giving all crocodilians 
a fundamental number of 56∼60, which suggested that the 
ancestral crocodilian karyotype was highly conserved [19, 
20-23,  26].  The  chromosome  number  in  Alligatoridae 
(Alligator 2n = 32, and Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleosuchus 
2n = 42) is more varied than in Crocodylidae (Gavialis and 
Tomistoma 2n = 32, Mecistops 2n = 30, Osteolaemus 2n = 38, 
Crocodylus  2n  =  30∼34).  Karyotypes  of  Caiman,  Melano-
suchus, and Paleosuchus show a large number of chromosome 
arms (NF = 60) [19, 20], suggesting that multiple centric 
fissions  occurred  after  they  diverged  from  Alligator. 
However,  the  largest  chromosome  variation  is  found  in 
Crocodylus. The diploid chromosome number of 4 from 12 
species  (C.  porosus,  C.  siamensis,  Crocodylus  palustris,  and 
Crocodylus rhombifer) differs from 32, despite having the same 
fundamental number (58) (Fig. 1). This suggests that centric 

104

fusion/fission  played  a  crucial  role  in  the  process  of 
chromosomal rearrangements, leading to the formation of 
ordinal radiation in the lineage of crocodilians. 

Crocodilian Phylogeny

Crocodilian  systematics  has  been  discussed  at  higher- 
level  relationships  based  on  morphological,  paleobio-
geography, and molecular data [1, 3-17, 53-55]. However, no 
study  has  completely  explained  crocodilian  relationships 
with  their  distribution  and  ecology.  Most  molecular  cro-
codilian phylogeny contains 23 species (Fig. 1). The use of 
complete  mitochondrial  (mt)  genome  sequences  and  the 
mixture of several molecular loci (nuclear and mt genes) 
obviously  provided  the  solution  for  at  least  three  major 
conflicts of crocodilian clustering: (1) phylogenetic position 
of G. gangeticus and Tomistoma schlegelii; (2) relationship of 
Mecistops cataphractus and Crocodylus; and (3) position of C. 
siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris. Firstly, the position of G. 
gangeticus and T. schlegelii was controversial, since G. gangeticus 
was  considered  to  be  Gavialidae  at  the  basal  position  of 
Crocodylia based on morphological evidence [1, 53]. The 
molecular  phylogenetic  study  of  complete  mt  genome 
sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci clearly 
showed that G. gangeticus was a sister-taxon with T. schlegelii, 
and  formed  the  sister  group  with  the  traditional  Croco-
dylidae (Fig. 1) [8-14, 16, 17]. This agreed with molecular 
sequence-based analyses of the CR1 retrotransposon which 
suggested that Alligatoridae (alligators and caimans) were 
sisters  to  all  other  crocodilians,  and  supported  the  G. 
gangeticus-T.  schlegelii  clade  [56].  Therefore,  only  the  two 
families  (Alligatoridae  and  Crocodylidae)  are  now  recog-
nized to be within Crocodylia. 

The  most  basal  species  within  Crocodylus  and  relative 
species  (Osteolaemus  tetraspis)  is  the  African  sharp-nosed 
crocodile,  M.  cataphractus  (formerly  called  Crocodylus  cata-
phractus)  [57].  Fossil  evidence  related  to  M.  cataphractus 
appeared in the Miocene and Pliocene in Africa [58-60], and 
implied that M. cataphractus was grouped within Crocodylus. 
However, molecular datasets suggested two relative species 
of two African crocodiles, M.  cataphractus and  O. tetraspis, 
being a sister group to the true crocodiles (Crocodylus) [4, 
8-17]. The last conflict issue concerned the position of C. 
siamensis, C. porosus, and C. palustris. In terms of molecular 
data,  a  complete  mt  genome  of  C.  siamensis  (DQ353946) 
showed it as a sister to C. porosus [24], whereas another mt 
genome sequence of C. siamensis (EF581859) related it to C. 
palustris [17]. Nonetheless, a molecular study based on the 
mixture of several molecular loci found in many C. siamensis 
individuals clearly showed that C. siamensis was sister to C. 
palustris and that C. porosus was sister to both species [16]. 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  13,  No.  4,  2015

This agreed with karyological data that showed 2n = 30 for 
C. siamensis and C. palustris, and 2n = 34 for C. porosus (Fig. 1) 
[19,  20,  21,  22,  26].  The  Siamese  crocodile  sample 
sequenced by Ji et al. [24] was probably a hybrid between C. 
siamensis × C. porosus, frequently found in captivity in the 
crocodile  industry  [61].  The  Siamese  crocodile  sample 
sequenced  by  Srikulnath  et  al.  [17]  was  confirmed  by 
karyotyping, and showed a chromosome number 2n = 30, a 
true C. siamensis. However, the relationship within Crocodylus 
remained  unclear  because  of  the  position  of  Indo-Pacific 
crocodilians (Fig. 1). A molecular study based on complete 
mt genome sequences strongly indicated two major groups: 
(1) The Indo-Pacific species and (2) The African-New World 
(America) species. A molecular study with the mixture of 
several molecular loci comprising nuclear and mitochondrial 
genes suggested that the African-New World species grou-
ped with C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis and was a 
sister clade with the group of Crocodylus mindorensis, Croco-
dylus novaeguineae, and Crocodylus johnstoni (Fig. 1) [16]. Mul-
tiple lines of evidence from biogeography and karyotypes 
have provided promising data to extensively discuss their 
evolutionary history.

Crocodilian Phylogeny Versus Chromosomal 
Rearrangements 

According  to  the  chromosome  constitution  of  croco-
dilians, it would appear that chromosome changes evolved in 
parallel  with  the  crocodilian  relationship.  Alligatoridae, 
which appeared in the early Tertiary, are considered to be the 
most primitive group in extant crocodilians [1]. There are 
two major crocodilians in Alligatoridae (Alligator and Caiman 
＋ Melanosuchus ＋ Paleosuchus) generally found in the New 
World (America). This agreed with karyological data, which 
showed different karyotypic features in both chromosome 
number and fundamental number. Two Alligator species (A. 
mississippiensis and A. sinensis) still have the same karyotype 
form (2n = 32), but the karyotype of Caiman, Melanosuchus, 
and Paleosuchus, a sister clade of Alligator contains a higher 
chromosome number (2n = 42): a lower number of bi-armed 
chromosomes and a higher number of uni-armed chromo-
somes. This suggests that multiple centric fission occurred 
at the split of Alligator and Caiman ＋ Melanosuchus ＋ Paleo-
suchus, around 50∼70 MYA before the middle of the Eocene 
(Fig. 1). This is more likely than an alternative explanation of 
the presence of centric fusion, because the karyotype of most 
crocodilians also exhibits 2n = 32. Interestingly, the total 
chromosome numbers of Caiman, Melanosuchus, and Paleo-
suchus are the same, but Paleosuchus contains a lower number 
of  bi-armed  and  a  higher  number  of  uni-armed  chromo-
somes, resulting in different fundamental numbers (Fig. 1).

K  Srikulnath,  et  al.  Chromosome  Change  in  Crocodilians

This suggests that Caiman  ＋ Melanosuchus and Paleosuchus 
evolved  independently  through  at  least  one  pericentric 
inversion or centromere positioning event, leading to ordinal 
radiation in two different lineages. 

Two Alligator species (A. mississippiensis and A. sinensis), 
which exhibit the same karyotype form of 2n = 32, spread 
over  more  than  one  biogeography.  A.  mississippiensis  is 
restricted  to  the  Southeastern  United  States,  whereas  A. 
sinensis is restricted to China. Both species shared a common 
ancestor around 20∼60 MYA (Fig. 1) [1, 16]. This suggested 
the possibility of a geographic isolation process that played 
an important role in their evolutionary history. An overland 
route (presumably through Beringia) is the shortest distance 
from North America to Asia. Alligator probably moved to 
Asia during the warmer climate of the early Tertiary [16], 
based  on  the  limitation  of  temperature  and  salt  water 
tolerance [62-64]. On the contrary, A. sinensis is the most 
cold-adapted of all living crocodilians, surviving the winter 
in burrows [65]. It might have moved into China during 
dramatic  temperature  changes.  However,  there  was  no 
evidence  to  support  this  idea  until  alligator  fossils  were 
found in Alaska [1]. 

The ancestral karyotype of crocodile is still retained in 
Crocodylidae. The karyotype of G. gangaticus (2n = 32) which 
resided  in  South-Asia,  is  also  highly  similar  to  that  of 
Alligator [19, 20]. However, the karyotype of T. schlegelii (2n = 
32),  distributed  around  South-East  Asia,  contains  lower 
numbers of bi-armed chromosomes and higher numbers of 
uni-armed chromosomes, and the fundamental numbers of 
these two species are different. This suggests the presence of 
pericentric  inversion  or  centromere  positioning,  which 
probably  occurred  in  T.  schlegelii  after  it  diverged  from  G. 
gangaticus  around  15∼35  MYA  in  the  late  Tertiary.  In 
Crocodylus  and  relative  species  (M.  cataphractus  and  O. 
tetraspis) lineage, the karyotype of M. cataphractus showed a 
lower  total  chromosome  number  with  higher  bi-armed 
chromosomes than those of T. schlegelii, despite having the 
same  fundamental  number  (58),  suggesting  that  the 
increase of bi-armed chromosomes is the result of centric 
fusion  among  the  ancestral  types  of  acrocentric  chromo-
somes  (Fig.  1).  By  contrast,  the  karyotype  of  O.  tetraspis 
showed  a  higher  total  chromosome  number  with  higher 
uni-armed chromosomes, but lower bi-armed chromosomes 
than those of G. gangaticus, T. schlegelii, and M. cataphractus 
[19, 20]. This suggests that at least multiple centric fissions 
occurred  after  O.  tetraspis  diverged  from  G.  gangaticus,  T. 
schlegelii, and M. cataphractus around 14∼37 MYA. 

Karyotypes  resembling  (2n  =  32)  T.  schlegelii  are  also 
found in Crocodylus. This suggests that both T. schlegelii and 
Crocodylus share the same karyotypic feature which is derived 
from  G.  gangaticus  and Alligator as a common ancestor  of 

Crocodylia. By contrast, Crocodylus, only one genus in croco-
dilians, shows variation of chromosome number and chro-
mosome  morphology,  in  spite  of  the  same  chromosome 
number. This suggests that karyotype evolution occurred in 
Crocodylus, and subsequently radiated karyotypic forms in 
different species, during the period of crocodilian extinction 
around 9∼16 MYA in the middle of the Miocene (Fig. 1) 
[16]. It is likely that after climate optimum in mid-Miocene, 
speciation process of Crocodylus was conducted along with 
global  cooling  and  glaciation  until  the  end  of  Pliocene, 
whereas other crocodilians underwent massive extinction 
[64]. The role of chromosome changes with species diversity 
is also found in other species during the same period, such as 
New World rodent (Calomys) [66] or African rodent (Tatera) 
[67]. Interestingly, the chromosome structure of Crocodylus 
species  is  likely  conserved  within  the  genus.  This  agreed 
with the presence of hybridization in captivity, often found in 
Crocodylus species. It would appear that all species from the 
genus have the potential to hybridize and produce fertile 
offspring. Examples of such events have been reported in 
both  sympatric  [68,  69]  and  allopatric  species  [61].  C. 
siamensis  with  chromosome  number  2n  =  30  has  also 
hybridized with C. porosus with chromosome number 2n = 
34. Chavananikul et al. [70] found that interspecific breeding 
of C. siamensis and C. porosus produced F1 hybrids (2n = 32) 
and  F2  offspring  with  2n  =  32.  This  suggested  hybrid 
viability,  despite  different  chromosome  numbers  in  the 
parent  generation.  This  probably  results  from  genome 
features that are still similar and not diverse in a short period 
of  time  in  Crocodylus.  Thus,  the  study  of  hybrid  viability, 
homologous  recombination,  and  meiotic  segregation 
mechanisms  may  be  critical  to  understand  their  genome 
evolution.  However,  the  relative  stability  of  Crocodylus 
genomes contributes to the lack of postzygotic reproductive 
isolation  mechanisms,  which  is  a  fascinating  aspect  of 
crocodilian evolutionary biology, and rejects the traditional 
biological species concept. Other evidence of high conser-
vation in chromosome structure is satellite DNA (stDNA) at 
the centromeric region on crocodilian chromosomes. Two 
stDNAs (CSI-HindIII-S and CSI-HindIII-M) isolated from C. 
siamensis and localized to centromeric regions of all chro-
mosomes, except for chromosome 2, were highly conserved 
throughout several crocodilian species (Crocodylus niloticus, T. 
schlegelii, G. gangeticus, A. mississippiensis, A. sinensis, Caiman 
crocodilus, and Caiman latirostris) [21]. This suggested that 
CSI-HindIII sequences were contained in the karyotype of a 
common ancestor of Crocodylia. However, the evolutionary 
history  of  Crocodylus  species  recently  diversified  during  a 
period  of  crocodilian  extinction.  This  tallied  with  the 
evidence of a centromeric stDNA (CSI-DraI), which was also 
isolated from C. siamensis and localized to chromosome 2,

and  four  pairs  of  small-sized  chromosomes,  were  re-
cognized in the genus Crocodylus but not in other crocodilians 
(Lapbenjakul et al. unpublished data) [21]. This suggested 
that CSI-DraI differentiated as a very rapidly evolving mole-
cule in the Crocodylus lineage when crocodilian extinction 
began, and the molecular structure of centromeric regions of 
Crocodylus evolved independently from other crocodilians. 
Within the Crocodylus lineage, molecular sequence analy-
ses  suggested  highly  recent  radiation  in  this  crocodilian 
group (Fig. 1) [16]. The relationship of A ＋ T content (%) 
and AT-skew of the mtDNA genome also agreed with this 
indication as a high correlation between A ＋ T content and 
AT-skew in many Crocodylus species but low correlation in 
other crocodilians (Fig. 2), suggesting that the bias of base 
substitution that occurred in the Crocodylus lineage did not 
have  time  to  eminently  alter  the  base  composition  of 
mtDNA genome as in other crocodilian divergences [17]. 
Traditionally, Crocodylus was considered to have originated in 
Africa during the Cretaceous [71], and their current distri-
bution has resulted from continental drift [72]. However, 
recent molecular data and fossil records in Asia suggested 
that the Indo-Pacific was the place of origin of Crocodylus 
species [16]. They then migrated to the land based on two 
hypotheses:  (1)  dispersion  from  Indo-Pacific  to  the  New 
World, followed by dispersion to Africa; and (2) dispersion 
from the Indo-Pacific into Africa, followed by dispersion to 
the New World.

The Indo-Pacific to the New World 

This hypothesis suggested the trans-Pacific dispersion of

Crocodylus from the Indo-Pacific to the New World around 
8∼12 MYA, followed by moving to Africa from the New 
World around 4∼8 MYA. This hypothesis was supported by 
at  least  three  pieces  of  evidence:  the  presence  of  fossil 
crocodilian records within Asia and the New World [1, 73], 
the distribution of the saltwater crocodile C. porosus, and the 
extinct Crocodylus lineage in the Pacific islands. Molecular 
phylogenetic  placement  by  Oaks  [16]  showed  the  sister 
group of C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. siamensis clade and 
New World Crocodylus species. However, it is hard to explain 
how C. porosus (2n = 34) and/or C. palustris and C. siamensis 
(2n = 30) migrated and evolved into New World species (2n 
= 32), whose karyotype retains an ancestral form. It is likely 
that 
the 
proto-Crocodylus karyotype by centric fission, and the New 
World  species  karyotypes  experienced  centric  fusion 
reversibly again from C. porosus.

the  C.  porosus  karyotype  resulted 

from 

The Indo-Pacific to Africa 

The  dispersion  of  Crocodylus  from  the  Indo-Pacific  into 
Africa  occurred  8∼12  MYA,  followed  by  trans-Atlantic 
dispersion to the New World 4∼8 MYA. The crocodilian 
fossil  record  also  showed  that  Crocodylus  species  were 
present in Southern Europe and Northern Africa during the 
late Miocene with warmer and wetter climate across this 
region  [74-76].  This  might  have  allowed  the  Crocodylus 
species  to  move  from  Asia  into  Africa  without  requiring 
long-distance marine dispersion. It is likely that the species 
group  comprising  C.  mindorensis,  C.  novaeguineae,  and  C. 
johnstoni, positioned to the basal node of the phylogenetic 
tree as suggested by Oaks [16] might be the origin of the 
Indo- Pacific species. This agreed with karyological data of 
Crocodylus,  which  showed  a  diploid  chromosome  of  C. 
mindorensis, C. novaeguineae, C. johnstoni (Indo-Pacific species) 
C. niloticus (African species), Crocodylus moreletii, Crocodylus 
acutus, and Crocodylus intermedius (New World species) to be 
32. Crocodylus maintained the broad African and Indo- Pacific 
distribution,  and  then  split  between  the  African  ＋ New 
World species clade and the remaining Indo-Pacific species 
around 4∼8 MYA. 

The latter hypothesis is more likely, based on the most 
parsimonious explanation with karyological data. This also 
agreed  with  the  phylogenetic  relationship  of  some  Nile 
crocodiles  (C.  niloticus),  complete  mt  genome  sequences 
placed with those of New World species, and the exclusion of 
Nile  crocodiles  from  other  populations  [15].  The  two 
earliest fossils of C. niloticus and New World species appear 
during the Pliocene [73], and C. niloticus has lingual salt- 
excreting glands. Moreover, some populations of C. niloticus 
occupy  estuarine  habitats  [63].  This  suggested  that  an

African crocodilian crossed the Atlantic recently, when this 
oceanic barrier was hundreds of miles wide [15, 77]. The 
presence of trans-Atlantic dispersion is also found in other 
vertebrates [78]. 

The molecular placement of C. porosus, C. palustris, and C. 
siamensis is expected to position as the sister to African ＋ 
New World species (Fig. 1). The ancestral karyotype feature 
is  still  retained  in  African  and  New  World  crocodiles. 
Comparison  of  the  data  of  chromosome  painting  in  C. 
niloticus and chromosome maps with functional genes in C. 
siamensis, revealed that five large chromosomes of C. siamensis 
correspond to six large chromosomes of C. niloticus [23, 26]. 
C.  siamensis  chromosome  3  (CSI3)  is  metacentric,  and  C. 
niloticus chromosome 5 (CNI5) and CNI6 are acrocentrics. 
CSI3p  corresponds  to  CNI6,  and  CSI3q  to  CNI5.  This 
suggests that bi-armed chromosomes CSI3 are the results of 
centric  fusion  among  the  ancestral  types  of  acrocentric 
chromosomes (Fig. 3). A centric fusion event is more likely 
because CNI5 and CNI6 are considered the prototypes in the 
lineages of Crocodylus, based on the evidence of karyotype 
and chromosome constitution with other crocodilians [19, 
20]. The karyotype of C. palustris and C. siamensis (2n = 30) 
probably resulted from one centric fusion of two acrocentric 
chromosomes  from  ancestral  Crocodylus  species  from  the 
Indo-Pacific species, leading to the reduction of uni-armed 
chromosomes in both two species. By contrast, karyotype of 
C. porosus (2n = 34) might result from one centric fission of 
large  bi-armed  chromosomes  from  ancestral  Crocodylus 

species, leading to the increase of acrocentric chromosomes. 
Simultaneously, the molecular placement of New World 
species  is  also  controversial,  considering  complete  mt 
genome sequences and the mixture of several molecular loci, 
in which C. rhombifer and C. moreletii are positioned at a basal 
or recent clade (Fig. 1). The karyotype data of C. niloticus and 
New World species (C. acutus and C. intermedius) suggest that 
the  karyotype  of  C.  moreletii  and  C.  rhombifer  is  probably 
located  at  the  recent  clade  of  New  World  species.  The 
karyotype of C. moreletii contains a lower number of bi-armed 
chromosomes and a higher number of uni-armed chromo-
somes, compared to C. acutus and C. intermedius, making the 
fundamental numbers of these three species different. This 
suggests  that  the  presence  of  pericentric  inversion  or 
centromere positioning has probably occurred in the ances-
tral karyotype of C. moreletii after divergence from C. acutus 
and C. intermedius around 3∼7 MYA during the Pliocene. By 
contrast, the karyotype of C. rhombifer contains 2n = 30, and 
centric  fusion  might  have  occurred  in  the  ancestral 
karyotype, leading to the reduction of acrocentric chromo-
somes in C. rhombifer. 

Conclusions

The  role  of  chromosomal  rearrangement  led  us  to 
understand  the  evolutionary  history  of  crocodilians  to 
sauropsids and within the crocodilian lineage. It is likely that 
centric  fusion/fission  is  a  key  evolutionary  force  of 
crocodilian diversity. The Crocodylus group is considered to 
have variation of karyotypic features, comprising 2n = 30, 
32,  and  34,  whereas  the  chromosome  number  of  the 
remaining group was fixed in each lineage. The Crocodylus 
species originated from an ancestor in the Indo-Pacific, and 
rapidly radiated and dispersed around the globe during a dire 
period  in  crocodilian  extinction.  Moreover,  Crocodylus 
species probably underwent multiple transoceanic disper-
sions from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and to the New World. 
Karyotype analysis also supported the direction of molecular 
phylogenetic  placement 
in  crocodilians,  which  was 
previously  controversial.  The  study  also  provided  insight 
into  the  phylogenetic  hierarchy  of  genome  evolution  in 
crocodilians.
