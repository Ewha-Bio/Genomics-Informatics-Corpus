Introduction

Abstract

A  systems  biology  approach  for  the  identification  of  per-
turbed  molecular  functions  is  required  to  understand  the 
complex  progressive  disease  such  as  breast  cancer.  In 
this  study,  we  analyze  the  microarray  data  with  Gene 
Ontology  terms  of  molecular  functions  to  select  per-
turbed  molecular  functional  modules  in  breast  cancer 
tissues  based  on  the  definition  of  Gene  ontology 
Functional  Code.  The  Gene  Ontology  is  three  structured 
vocabularies  describing  genes  and  its  products  in  terms 
of  their  associated  biological  processes,  cellular  compo-
nents  and  molecular  functions.  The  Gene  Ontology  is  hi-
erarchically  classified  as  a  directed  acyclic  graph.  How-
ever,  it  is  difficult  to  visualize  Gene  Ontology  as  a  di-
rected  tree  since  a  Gene  Ontology  term  may  have  more 
than  one  parent  by  providing  multiple  paths  from  the 
root.  Therefore,  we  applied  the  definition  of  Gene 
Ontology  codes  by  defining  one  or  more  GO  code(s)  to 
each  GO  term  to  visualize  the  hierarchical  classification 
of  GO  terms  as  a  network.  The  selected  molecular  func-
tions  could  be  considered  as  perturbed  molecular  func-
tional  modules  that  putatively  contributes  to  the  pro-
gression  of  disease.  We  evaluated  the  method  by  ana-
lyzing  microarray  dataset  of  breast  cancer  tissues;  i.e., 
normal  and  invasive  breast  cancer  tissues.  Based  on  the 
integration  approach,  we  selected  several  interesting 
perturbed  molecular  functions  that  are  implicated  in  the 
progression  of  breast  cancers.  Moreover,  these  selected 
molecular  functions  include  several  known  breast  can-
cer-related  genes.  It  is  concluded  from  this  study  that 
the  present  strategy  is  capable  of  selecting  perturbed 
molecular  functions  that  putatively  play  roles  in  the  pro-
gression  of  diseases  and  provides  an  improved  inter-
pretability  of  GO  terms  based  on  the  definition  of  Gene 
Ontology  codes.

A  major  challenge  in  molecular  biology  is  the  identi-
fication  of  genes  or  molecular  functions  involved  in  dis-
eases  and  other  biological  process.  Over  the  past  deca-
des,  DNA  microarrays  have  been  widely  used  for  this 
problem  due  to  their  ability  of  parallel  monitoring  of  the 
genome-wide  transcriptional  profiling.  The  conventional 
analysis  of  microarray  data  starts  with  normalization,  fol-
lowed  by  the  test  statistics  to  compare  expression  lev-
els  in  different  phenotypes  for  each  gene,  yielding  thou-
sands  of  differentially  expressed  genes  (Dhanasekaran 
et al.,  2001).  However,  this  strategy  is  limited  due  to  the 
fact  that  differentially  expressed  genes  can  be  analyzed 
one-at-a-time.  In  addition,  most  genes  are  known  to 
function  in  concert  rather  than  alone,  and  their  products 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  DNA  by  forming  dy-
namic  topological  interactomes.  Therefore,  a  systems  bi-
ology  approach  that  can  identify  perturbed  molecular 
functions  with  differentially  expressed  genes  would  ac-
celerate  the  understanding  the  basic  molecular  mecha-
nism  of  certain  phenotypes  or  diseases.
    The  Gene  Ontology  (The  Gene  Ontology  Consortium, 
2000)  is  a  database  of  structured  controlled  ontology 
that  describe  gene  product  in  terms  of  their  biological 
processes,  cellular  components,  and  molecular  functions. 
GO  is  a  hierarchically  structure  forming  an  acyclic  di-
graph  with  top-down  directions,  which  provides  an  effi-
cient navigation for the structure of the ontology. However, 
the  same  GO  term  may  occur  in  different  lines  of  ontol-
ogy  structure.  It  means  that  GO  may  not  be  represented 
as  directed  tree  since  a  GO  term  may  have  more  than 
one  parent  providing  multiple  paths  from  the  root.  To 
construct  an  ordered  GO  tree  for  the  purpose  of  global 
visualization,  GO  terms  need  to  be  distinguished  from 
one  another  if  they  are  occurred  in  different  locations  on 
the  hierarchical  classification  of  gene  ontology.  Based 
on  the  biological  point  of  view,  Lee et al.  (2004)  justified 
that  what  is  more  important  is  not  a  GO  term  itself,  but 
which  path  the  GO  terms  takes  from  the  root  in  the 
gene  ontology.  It  means  that  each  location  of  a  GO 
term  could  be  considered  distinct  if  a  distinct  path  leads 
to  it  from  the  root  of  gene  ontology.  Therefore,  we  de-

fined  Gene  ontology  Functional  Code  (GFC)  to  each  GO 
term  based  on  the  definition  of  GO  codes  by  Lee et al. 
(2004).  Note  that  a  unique  GO  code  is  assigned  to  a 
GO  term  in  each  location  of  the  classification  of  gene 
ontology.  It  therefore  means  that  the  visualization  of 
gene  ontology  based  on  GO  codes  will  provide  more  in-
terpretability  of  gene  ontology  than  the  one  based  on 
GO  terms.
    Many  progressive  diseases  such  as  cancer  are  caused 
by  combinatorial  effect  of  multiple  genes  rather  than  a

single  gene.  In  this  study,  we  integrated  the  microarray 
data  with  GO  terms  to  find  the  perturbed  molecular 
functions  in  breast  cancer  tissues  using  GO  codes  in 
molecular  function.  To  this  end,  we  identify  several  per-
turbed  molecular  functions  that  are  implicated  to  play 
roles  in  the  progression  of  breast  cancer. 

Methods

The  hierarchical  classification  of  gene  ontology  is  basi-
cally  represented  as  a  directed  acyclic  graph  (DAG)  with 
three  categories,  namely  molecular  function,  biological 
process  and  cellular  component  (Ashburner et al.,  2000). 
Based  on  this  hierarchical  classification,  GO  terms  can 
be  represented  as  node  by  an  acyclic  digraph.  However, 
GO  DAG  is  difficult  to  be  visualized  as  a  directed  tree 
since  a  GO  term  may  have  more  than  one  parent  by 
providing  multiple  paths  from  the  root.  Thus,  we  have 
adopted  the  definition  of  GO  code  (Lee et al.,  2004;  Fig. 
1),  in  which  GO  terms  can  be  efficiently  handled  in  a 
tree  structure  by  defining  one  or  more  GO  code(s)  to 
each  GO  term,  to  visualize  the  hierarchical  classification 
of  GO  terms  as  a  network.  That  is,  a  GO  code  is  as-
signed  to  a  GO  term  in  each  location  of  the  classi-
fication  of  gene  ontology.  A  GO  term  is  transformed  into 
a  GO  code  α1α2α3…αH  using  the  unique  path  from 
the  root  of  the  classification  of  GO  to  each  GO  term,  in 
which  H  is  the  length  of  a  longest  path  from  the  root 
to  each  GO  term  in  the  classification  of  GO.  The  GO 
codes  can  be  represented  as  nodes  in  the  ordered  tree 
of  GO  category.  Each  node  is  located  on  the  level N  of 
GO  tree  for N=1,2,…H.  See  Lee et al.’s  (2004)  study  for 
more  detail  of  GO  code.  In  this  study,  we  have  focused

on  the  GO  code  for  the  GO  term  of  molecular  function, 
which  is  defined  as  Gene  ontology  Functional  Code 
(GFC).  Note  that  for  the  probe  set  of  Affymetrix 
GeneChip Human Genome  U133 Plus 2.0  Array  chip, 
the  distribution  of  GFC  classes  and  average  number  of 
entries  per  each  GFC  class  corresponding  to  the  level 
of  GFC  is  listed  in  Table  1.
    To  visualize  the  perturbed  molecular  functions  in  breast 
cancer  tissues  using  GFC,  we  analyzed  the  microarray 
dataset  from  Turashvilli  et al.  (2007),  which  consists  of 
2  types  of  breast  cancer  tissues;  i.e.,  invasive  lobular 
and  ductal  carcinomas.  This  dataset  includes  a  total  of 
30  samples  that  consist  of  10  samples  from  normal 
ductal  cells,  10  samples  from  normal  lobular  cells,  5 
samples  from  invasive  ductal  carcinoma  cells,  and  5 
samples  from  invasive  lobular  carcinoma  cells,  which 
were  microdissected  from  cryosections  of  10  mastec-
tomy  specimens  from  postmenopausal  patients.
    Before  selecting  the  perturbed  molecular  functional 
modules,  we  applied  the  two  steps  of  data  processing. 
First,  the  log2  transformation  of  fold  change  between 
normal  and  disease  states  was  applied  for  each  sample 
array.  Second,  the  average  of  log2-fold  change  was  cal-
culated  for  the  probe  set  of  each  GFC.  The  distribution 
of  average  of  log2-fold  change  for  each  GFC  depending 
on  the  size  of  GFCs  is  shown  in  Fig.  1A.  It  is  observed 
that  the  GFCs  with  relatively  large  size  tend  to  have  sig-
nificantly  smaller  average  values  of  log2-fold  change 
than  the  ones  with  small  size.  It  means  that  it  is  difficult 
to  discriminate  the  perturbed  molecular  functional  mod-
ules  with  relatively  large  size  using  the  average  value  of 
log2-fold  change.  To  overcome  this  difficulty,  the  aver-
age  values  of  log2-fold  change  were  z-transformed  de-
pending  on  the  size  of  GFCs  as  follows.  First,  the  GFCs 
were  divided  into  152  subsets,  in  which  each  subset 

consists  of  GFCs  with  same  or  similar  sizes.  Second, 
the  average  value  of  log2-fold  change  in  each  subset 
was  standardized  such  that  its  mean  and  standard  devi-
ation  are  0  and  1,  respectively.  After  z-transformation,  it

GFCs  of  which  size  are  relatively  large  (Fig.  1B).

Results  and  Discussion

The  global  network  of  hierarchical  molecular  functional 
classes  of  GO  was  constructed  using  GFC  in  Fig.  2. 

The  “z-transformed”  average  of  log2-fold  change  for 
each  GFC  was  integrated  with  the  network  to  visualize 
the  perturbed  molecular  functional  modules  in  breast 
cancer  tissues.  Note  that  the  colored  (e.g.,  red  or  blue) 
nodes  represent  the  perturbed  molecular  functional 
classes  in  Fig.  2,  and  the  sub-network  with  enriched 
color  nodes  could  be  chosen  for  further  analysis  of  per-

turbed  molecular  functional  modules.  As  an  example,  we 
chose  the  two  sub-networks  with  relatively  enriched  per-
turbed  GFCs  in  Fig.  2  (A)  and  (B)  for  more  detailed 
analysis.
    The  perturbed  molecular  functional  modules  in  Fig.  2 
(A)  and  (B)  are  listed  in  Table  2  and  3,  and  the  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  for  those  GFC  in  Table  1  and 
3  are  listed  in  Table  4  and  5,  respectively.  Table  2  in-
cludes  15  perturbed  molecular  functional  modules  that 
are  mainly  encompassed  by  three  major  molecular  func-
tional  activities:  1)  G-protein  coupled  peptide  receptor 
activity,  2)  immunoglobulin  binding  activity,  and  3)  inter-
leukin  binding  activity.  Table  3  includes  38  perturbed 
molecular  functional  modules  that  are  mainly  encom-
passed  by  peptide  receptor  activity.  There  are  sig-
nificant  indications  that  these  molecular  functions  are 
associated  with  human  cancers  as  follows.
    The  G-protein  coupled  peptide  receptor  activity  en-
compasses  the  perturbed  molecular  functional  modules 
such  as  C-C  chemokine  binding/receptor  activity  and 
C-3X-C  chemokine  binding/receptor  activity  (Table  2)  in-
cluding  differentially  expressed  genes  such  as  CX3CR1, 
DARC,  CXCR4,  and  CCRL2  (Table  4).  Recent  review 
study  by  Dorsam  et al.  (2007)  addressed  that  G-pro-
tein-coupled  receptors  (GPCRs)  have  crucial  roles  in  tu-
mor  growth  and  metastasis  and  malignant  cells  often 
seize  control  of  the  normal  physiological  functions  of 
GPCRs  to  survive,  proliferate  autonomously,  evade  the 
immune  system,  increase  their  blood  supply,  invade 
their surrounding tissues and disseminate to other tissues. 
Chemokines  are  leukocyte  chemoattractants  that  are 
divided  structurally  into  four  subgroups,  based  on  the 
composition  of  cysteine  residues  in  their  amino-terminal 
portion.  It  has  been  shown  that  target  organs  for  breast 
cancer  metastases  are  enriched  in  the  chemokine 

CXCL-12,  inducing  the  specific  migration  of  breast  tu-
mor  cells  that  express  the  relevant  receptor  for  this  che-
mokine,  CXCR4  (Muller  et al.,  2001).
    The  immunoglobulin  binding  activity  encompasses  the 
several  perturbed  molecular  functional  modules  such  as 
IgA/E/G/M  receptor  activity  and  polymeric  immunoglob-
ulin  binding/receptor  activity  (Table  2)  including  differ-
entially  expressed  gene  such  as  FCGR1B  (Table  4).  Qiu 
et al.  (2003)  demonstrated  that  human  cancers  of  breast 
epithelial  cancer  lines  produce  immunoglobulins  in  both 
cytoplasmic  and  secreted  form.  Their  study  indicates 
that  prevalent  expression  of  immuglobulin  in  human  car-
cinomas  and  its  growth-promoting  functions  may  have 
important  implications  in  growth  regulation  of  human 
cancers.  Monocyte  activation  in  cancer  patients  could 
be  an  indication  of  anticancer  activity.  However,  Goodale 
et al.  (2009)  showed  that  recruitment  of  macrophase 
can  promote  tumor  growth  and  angiogenesis  by  analyz-
ing  the  collected  peripheral  blood  using  flow  cytometry 
for  monocyte  activation.  They  demonstrated  that  meta-
static  breast  cancer  patients  have  a  higher  monocyte 
FCGR1B  (CD64)  index  relative  to  normal  donors  and  lo-
calized  breast  cancer  patients.
    The  interleukin  binding  activity  encompasses  three 
perturbed  molecular  functional  modules  such  as  inter-
leukin-6  binding,  nerve  growth  factor  binding,  and  plate-
let-derived  growth  factor  binding  (Table  2)  including  dif-
ferentially  expressed  genes  such  as  IL15RA,  IL17RB, 
and  PDGFRA  (Table  4).  Interleukin-17  (IL-17)  is  the  core 
member  of  a  group  of  cytokines  (i.e.,  the  IL-17  family), 
which  was  identified  as  a  transcript  from  a  rodent  T-cell 
hybridoma  by  Rouvier  et al.  (1993).  IL-17  induces  the 
production  of  many  other  cytokines  (e.g.,  IL-6,  IL-1beta, 
TGF-beta,  TNF-beta),  chemokines  (e.g.,  IL-8)  and  pros-
taglandins  (e.g.,  PGE2)  from  many  cell  types  (fibroblast,

endothelial  cells,  epithelial  cells,  keratinocytes  and  mac-
rophases).  It  is  well  known  that  TGF-beta  plays  a  role 
as  an  antiproliferative  factor  in  normal  epithelial  cells 
and  at  early  stages  of  onogenesis  (Hill et al.,  2009).  The 
IL-17  family  has  been  linked  to  many  immune/auto-
immune  related  diseases  including  anti-tumor  immunity 
(Aggarwal  and  Gurney,  2002).  It  should  be  noted  that 
this  study  suggests  molecular  functional  modules  for 
breast  cancer  are  down-regulated  in  Table  2.  The  plate-

let-derived  growth  factors  (PDGFA-A  and  -B)  are  im-
portant  factors  regulating  cell  proliferation,  cellular  differ-
entiation,  cell  growth,  development  and  many  diseases 
including  cancer.  PDGF  and  its  receptor  are  important 
targets in cancer therapy based on angiogenesis (Sennino 
et al.,  2009). 
    The  peptide  receptor  activity  encompasses  38  per-
turbed  molecular  functional  modules  (Table  3)  including 
several  differentially  expressed  genes  (Table  5).  There

tide  receptors  are  expressed  in  large  quantities  in  cer-

expression  in  human  cancers,  which  could  be  consid-
ered  to  be  the  molecular  basis  for  peptide  receptor  tar-

amount  of  genes  in  Table  5  that  are  implicated  to  play 
roles  in  the  progression  of  breast  cancer  or  other  can-
cers, including BDKRB2 (Greco et al., 2005), PLCB1 (Naor,

    Based  on  the  integration  of  GFC  codes  and  micro-
array  data  of  breast  cancer  tissues,  we  present  several 

perturbed  molecular  functions,  which  are  implicated  in 
the  progression  of  breast  cancer.  It  was  also  found  that 
these  selected  molecular  functions  include  several  known 
breast  cancer  related  genes.  Moreover,  it  is  believed 
that  our  strategy  provides  efficient  visual  interpretability 
of  microarray  data  integrated  with  GFC  to  understand 
the  perturbed  molecular  functions  in  complex  progressive 
diseases  such  as  breast  cancer.  Therefore,  the  selected 
perturbed  molecular  functions  in  this  study  could  be  fur-
ther  investigated  to  understand  the  basic  molecular 
functions,  which  discriminate  different  breast  cancer 
types.
