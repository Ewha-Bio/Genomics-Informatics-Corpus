Besides single-nucleotide variants  in  the human  genome,  large-scale  genomic variants,  such as  copy number variations 
(CNVs), are being increasingly discovered as a genetic source of human diversity and the pathogenic factors of diseases. 
Recent experimental findings have shed light on the links between different genome architectures and CNV mutagenesis. In 
this review, we summarize various genomic features and discuss their contributions to CNV formation. Genomic repeats, 
including both low-copy and high-copy repeats, play important roles in CNV instability, which was initially known as DNA 
recombination events. Furthermore, it has been found that human genomic repeats can also induce DNA replication errors 
and consequently result in CNV mutations. Some recent studies showed that DNA replication timing, which reflects the 
high-order information of genomic organization, is involved in human CNV mutations. Our review highlights that genome 
architecture, from DNA sequence to high-order genomic organization, is an important molecular factor in CNV mutagenesis 
and human genomic instability.

Introduction

Genetic  mutations  have  been  known  as  one  of  the  key 
factors in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Besides the 
well-known single-nucleotide variants, it has been shown that 
the large-scale genomic variants also make a great contribution 
to  human  health.  ‘Genomic  disorders’  are  human  diseases 
caused by relatively large genomic rearrangements [1]. Such 
large-scale genomic variants (named copy number variation 
[CNV]) can also be frequent in human populations [2, 3]. 
CNV involves DNA segments larger than 1 kb and exhibits 
variable  copy  numbers  among  individuals,  comprising 
deletions and duplications/insertions [4, 5]. In the past 10 
years, CNV has been found to play an important role in both 
sporadic Mendelian disorders and complex diseases. Previous 
studies have reported that CNV can be mediated by multiple 
molecular  mechanisms  involving  various  genomic  features. 
Here,  we  focus  on  CNV  mutagenesis  and  review  the 
involvement of human genome architecture in CNV instability 
and the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Non-allelic Homologous Recombination 
between Human Genomic Repeats
Genomic disorders and low-copy repeats

Large-scale genomic changes in the human genome can be 
associated  with  human  diseases.  Such  clinical  conditions 
resulting  from  human  genome  architecture  are  termed 
‘genomic  disorders’  [1].  The  structural  features,  such  as 
genomic  repeats,  can  provide  substrates  for  homologous 
recombination  and  induce  genomic  rearrangements  and 
genomic disorders.

Stankiewicz and Lupski [6] defined region-specific low- 
copy  repeats  (LCRs)  as  paralogous  genomic  segments 
spanning 10–400 kb of genomic DNA and sharing ≥95%–
97%  sequence identity. The non-allelic homologous recom-
bination (NAHR) between directly oriented LCRs can gener-
ate microdeletions and microduplications of megabases in 
size, which are frequently associated with genomic disorders 
(Fig. 1). For example, the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a 
well-investigated disorder caused by microdeletions between

the genomes of other primates, including chimpanzee, gorilla, 
and orangutan, and even in the mouse genome [17-20], all of 
which  have  been  archived  in  the  online  database  of  the 
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Brow-
ser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/).

LCR/SD is a very important category of DNA architecture 
in  the  human  genome.  It  has  been  found  that  they  are 
associated  with  duplicated  genes  and  pseudogenes  [21], 
co-localize and overlap with Alu elements and CNV [22, 23], 
and play an important role in genome evolution [24-26]. 
LCR/SD pairs, acting as substrates, are thought to be a key 
factor  in  triggering  NAHR  events  and  causing  CNV 
mutations [4, 27-32]. 

Generally,  reversely  oriented  SDs  can  align  and  subse-
quently crossover with each other via NAHR, resulting in 
copy-neutral inversions of the flanking DNA fragments (Fig. 
1A). Similarly, NAHR events between direct SD pairs can 
cause CNVs. Based on the different positions of SD pairs, 
different types of CNVs occur. Duplications or deletions take 
place in NAHR events between different chromatids (inter- 
chromatid) (Fig. 1B), while only deletions occur in NAHR on 
the same chromatid (intra-chromatid) (Fig. 1C). 

Based on the observations in specific pathogenic loci, SD 
properties  (including  homology  length,  distance,  and  se-
quence  similarity)  were  shown  to  affect  the  incidence  of 
NAHR [33]. In a recent study on common CNVs in human 
populations,  it  was  found  that  SD  length  and  inter-SD 
distance were the major SD properties involved in NAHR 
frequency [34]. A model of chromosomal compression/ex-
tension/looping has also been proposed for homology mis- 
pairing in NAHR [34].

High-copy repeats in CNV instability

The genomic repeats representing DNA primary struc-
tures can be divided into LCR/SD and high-copy repeats. 
Compared to LCR/SD, high-copy repeats constitute a great 
portion of the human genome. Interspersed repeats are the 
most common type of high-copy repeats, which cover over 
44% of the human genome [35]. One of the major classes of 
interspersed repeats is the retrotransposon, including short 
interspersed elements (SINEs), long interspersed elements 
(LINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs).
SINEs are short DNA sequences (100–400 bp in length) 
with  an  internal  (mobile)  polymerase  III  promoter  [15], 
making up about 11% of the human genome [36]. The most 
common SINEs are Alu elements, which burst out in the 
evolution of primates [37]. Moreover, Alu elements play an 
important  role  in  disease,  such  as  breast  cancer,  Ewing's 
sarcoma, familial hypercholesterolemia, and so on [38]. In 
2008, Kim et al. [22] found a strong association between Alu 
elements and old SDs. By means of NAHR, Alu elements

the paired LCRs in human 22q11.2, which deletes one copy 
of TBX1, CRKL, MAPK1, and several additional genes [7-10]. 
In addition  to microdeletions,  microduplications can  also 
manifest  as  genomic  disorders.  The  1.4-Mb  microdupli-
cation involving the PMP22 gene in human 17p12 can lead to 
CMT1A, which is a classical model for disease resulting from 
gene dosage effects [11, 12].

Segmental duplication and NAHR

Genomic repeats play a significant role in human evolu-
tion and have a strong association with genomic CNVs [6, 
13-15]. In 2001, Eichler [16] initially conducted a systema-
tically  bioinformatic  analysis  for  such  low-copy  genomic 
repeats and defined them as segmental duplications (SDs), 
which have a high degree of sequence identity (＞90%–95%) 
and large genomic sizes (1–100 kb). After that, Bailey et al. 
[17]  further  performed  a  whole-genome  assembly  com-
parison to detect SDs with pair-wise alignments ≥ 90% and 
≥ 1 kb in the human genome. In addition to human SDs, the 
subsequent analyses also identified the SD architecture in

L  Chen,  et  al.  Genome  Architecture  and  Copy  Number  Variation

contribute to the formation of CNVs, especially deletions 
[39-43].
The most classic repeats in LINEs are the LINE-1 (L1) 
elements, which are 6–8 kb in length [44]. Covering about 
17% of the human genome, L1 elements can elevate genomic 
instability, provide resources for NAHR [39-41, 45, 46], and 
cause human diseases [47-50].

In the human genome, there exist at least 50,000 copies of 
ERVs [51], which are defined as human endogenous retro-
viruses  (HERVs),  covering  about  4.9%  of  human  DNA 
sequences [21]. Via the NAHR mechanism, HERVs were 
found  to  induce  large  deletions  and  cause  hypotonia  and 
motor, language, and cognitive delays [52, 53]. Intriguingly, 
a series of studies show that there is a strong association 
between  HERVs  and  CNVs  in  the  region  of  AZFa,  a 
well-known locus related to male infertility [54-57].

Repeat-Induced  DNA  Replication  Error  and 
CNV Mutation

As discussed above, repeat-mediated NAHR is one of the 
major mutational mechanisms for CNV formations. In these 
recombination-based  events,  paired  repeats  in  direct

variation  (CNV)  formation.  The  straight  lines  depict  single  DNA 
strands,  and  the  solid  arrows  (red  and  blue)  represent  genomic 
repeats. The dashed lines indicate newly synthesized DNA strands.
During DNA replication, adjacent repeats could form DNA second-
ary structures (such as hairpin) that consequently result in replication
fork stalling. Then, CNVs are generated via DNA template switch-
ing.  For  example,  (1)  jumping  over  the  secondary  structures  and 
restarting  DNA  replication  lead  to  deletions  and  (2)  switching  to 
a  new  template  (shown  in  green  lines)  and  switching  back  result 
in  duplications  of  the  green  DNA  segment.

orientation contribute to CNV instability and disease traits. 
However, is it the only way for the genomic repeats to induce 
CNV  mutations?  The  recent  investigation  of  DNA  repli-
cation-based  mechanisms  provides  novel  insights  into 
repeat-mediated CNV instability.

Inverted repeats involved in CNV instability

Genomic repeats, especially inverted repeats (IRs), can 
cause DNA replication error and induce CNV formation. IRs, 
sharing high sequence similarity in adjacent loci, are found 
to align or crossover with each other and form specific DNA 
secondary structures, such as cruciform structures, during 
DNA replication [58]. Formation of such secondary struc-
tures  can  cause  DNA  replication  fork  stalling,  and  later, 
jumping into the wrong locus to continue replicating (Fig. 
2).  This  mechanism  of  triggering  replication  errors  sub-
sequently  results  in  genomic  rearrangements  and  CNV 
mutations [24]. 

IRs induce complex CNVs by replication errors

During DNA replication, IRs could form DNA secondary 
structures,  which  will  induce  replication  fork  stalling. 
Template  switching  and  replication  resumption  further 
result  in  CNV  mutations  (Fig.  2).  Notably,  replication- 
associated  events  usually  lead  to  complex  CNVs,  which 
include  the  combined  segments  of  deletions  and  dupli-
cations. As was reported, Chen et al. [59] identified three 
complex CNVs that could be explained by a model of serial 
replication  slippage  (SRS).  In  this  model,  IRs  have  the 
potential to induce SRS and cause CNV mutations.

IRs can induce complex CNVs, as observed in the MECP2 
locus in chromosome Xq28 and the PLP1 locus in chromo-
some Xq22 [60]. To elucidate the mechanisms of complex 
CNVs in the PLP1 locus, Hastings et al. [61] found both 
microhomology and IRs at the breakpoints. They proposed 
that both breakage of replication forks and the IR-mediated 
aberrant repair process can result in complex CNVs. This 
model was termed ‘microhomology-mediated break-induced 
replication,’ which was used to explain the formation of the 
complex  CNVs  involving  individual  genes  or  even  single 
exons [62].

Self-chains in CNV formation

The aforementioned SDs are long (＞1 kb) and LCRs in 
the  human  genome.  Besides  SDs,  self-chains  (SCs)  are 
another type of short LCRs, which were previously analyzed 
and  mapped  via  self-alignment  in  the  human  genome 
utilizing BLASTZ [63, 64]. SCs are short in length (91% of 
which range from 150 bp to 1 kb in size) [14]. Furthermore, 
SCs have a limited number of matched alignments in the 
human genome. Thus, SCs represent a distinct category of 

138

human short LCRs.

In 2013, Chen et al. [65] studied deletion CNVs in the 
NRXN1 gene and its flanking regions. After mapping and 
analyzing  the  breakpoints  of  32  deletions,  they  found  a 
significant  bias  that  minus  SCs  (i.e.,  paired  SCs  in  the 
inverted orientation) were overrepresented in the vicinity of 
deletion  breakpoints  in  the  NRXN1  region.  Furthermore, 
they claimed that the SCs can increase genomic instability 
and cause deletions via DNA replication errors. Their work 
contributes to the exploration on SC-mediated CNVs.

To perform a genomewide analysis on the contribution of 
SCs to human CNV instability, Zhou et al. [14] plotted the 
numbers  of  SC  regions  with  different  orientations  in  the 
entire human genome. After masking the SDs and gaps in 
the human genome, utilizing the germline CNVs in human 
populations  and  the  somatic  CNVs  in  various  cancer 
genomes, they observed a significant biased distribution of 
CNV breakpoints to SC regions, which indicated that SC- 
mediated secondary structures may induce DNA replication 
errors and potentially generate different types of CNVs, such 
as deletions and duplications. In this case, SCs represent a 
new  genomic  architecture  for  the  underlying  regional 
susceptibility to genomic instability, further giving rise to 
CNVs.

DNA repair and nonhomologous end-joining

While DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) occur, nonho-
mologous  end-joining  (NHEJ)  is  one  of  the  molecular 
mechanisms  for  repairing  DSBs  and  maintaining  genome 
integrity. Once a DSB is detected, the broken DNA ends are 
bridged and modified by the enzyme machinery. After that, 
the final ligation is needed for DNA repair. Unlike NAHR, 
NHEJ can take place without any homology as the substrate. 
Notably,  deletions  or  insertions  of  several  base  pairs  are 
usually brought to the joint point. More mechanistic details 
of NHEJ are provided in some previous works [66-68].

DNA Replication Dynamics in CNV Mutage-
nesis

In addition to the aforementioned genomic features, some 
high-order  genome  organizations  might  contribute  to 
genome instability. New observations in the human genome 
showed that the DNA mutation rate is associated with DNA 
replication  timing.  Stamatoyannopoulos  et  al.  [69]  found 
that the human point mutation rate is markedly increased in 
genomic regions of late replication. This correlation indi-
cates that DNA replication timing, as an important feature of 
replication dynamics, is involved in genomic instability and 
enlightens  the  investigation  on  the  relationship  of  repli-
cation timing and CNV instability.

Replication timing as a high-order genomic feature

DNA replication takes place at replication forks following 
a fixed way [70]. In the human genome, the segments of 
chromosomes replicate in a temporal order [71], and the 
whole genome is spatially segregated by replication zones of 
different organizations. With some replicons in one spatial 
compartmentalization  of  chromatin  fired  synchronously, 
this chromosomal unit shares the same replication timing, 
termed  the  ‘replication  domain.’  Therefore,  the  genome 
consists  of  several  replication  domains  with  different 
replication timing and the timing transition regions.

Replication  timing  can  be  measured  by  two  distinct 
methods, based on current genome technologies [72-74]. 
One  method  is  to  label  the  newly  replicated  DNA  with 
chemically  tagged  nucleotides.  Then,  the  DNA  will  be 
isolated  from  cells  at  various  times  during  S  phase  by 
immune-precipitation or density fractionation. In the other 
method,  since  DNA  segments  that  replicate  earlier  accu-
mulate more copies than those that replicate late in most 
cells—the  DNA  content  of  a  region  simply  reflects  the 
replication  timing.  After  being  classified  by  florescence- 
activated cell sorting, the DNAs extracted from S phase and 
G1 phase cells, respectively, are compared by next-genera-
tion sequencing or microarray technologies. By either way, a 
replication timing profile can be generated (Fig. 3) [75].

Based on the timing profiles, a lot of progress has been 
made  on  understanding  the  replication  program  and  its 
relationship with other genome architectures. Recent find-
ings  indicate  significant  links  between  replication  timing 
and the features of primary genomic structures [76]. The 
genomic regions where DNA replicates earlier usually have 
more genes, fewer LINEs, and higher GC content [77, 78]. 
Moreover, it is noticed that DNA replication timing corre-
lates with transcription [79-81]. Expressed genes replicate 
earlier, while repressed genes replicate late. Although this 
correlation shows a discrepancy between multicellular and 
single-celled organisms, it is worth noting that such works

cells. The data of human chromosome 4, which were obtained from
Koren  et  al.  [75],  are  shown.  The  blue  lines  show  the  replication
timing, high values of which indicate that DNA replicates early in
these  regions,  and  vice  versa.

L  Chen,  et  al.  Genome  Architecture  and  Copy  Number  Variation

indeed reveal the striking association of replication timing 
and transcriptional activity in humans [77, 82, 83]. More-
over, recent findings show that replication timing strongly 
correlates  with  three-dimensional  chromatin  structures 
[84]. In Hi-C data, it has been observed that chromatin is 
organized  into  two  separate  compartments.  Remarkably, 
DNA that resides in close spatial structures replicates in near 
time, and chromatin that interacts between two compart-
ments  is  exactly  at  the  timing  transition  regions.  This 
observation suggests replication timing as an independent 
advanced genomic feature.

Replication timing and CNV instability in human 
populations and cancers

The relationship of DNA replication timing and genomic 
instability,  which  is  involved  in  genomic  mutation  and 
human disease, is what people are most concerned about. As 
mentioned above, human mutation rates, based on evolu-
tionary  divergence  and  single-nucleotide  polymorphism 
frequency,  are  increased  in  late-replicated  regions  [69]. 
Koren et al. [75] generated a high-resolution timing profile of 
the  human  genome  and  investigated  the  relationship 
between DNA replication timing and point mutations. In 
accordance with the previous discovery, this association was 
also observed and proved to be much stronger.

How is CNV related to replication timing? Recent studies 
showed some distinct but multi-dimensional relationships 
between  CNVs  and  replication  timing.  Based  on  the 
duplication  hotspots  conserved  between  two  species  of 
Drosophila, Cardoso-Moreira et al. [85] explored the roles of 
replication timing in genomic instability. They found that 
Drosophila duplication hotspots were enriched in late-repli-
cated regions, unlike the aforementioned sequences of high 
sequence identity in the human genome. However, in spite of 
the association observed in Drosophila, the situation seems to 
be more complicated in mammalian genomes. In the study of 
Koren  et  al.  [75],  the  relationship  between  early/late 
replication timing and CNV mutation was also investigated. 
The  CNVs,  mediated  by  different  mechanisms,  showed 
divergent  patterns,  suggesting  a  multi-dimensional  inter-
action between CNVs and replication timing.

In  addition  to  the  observations  in  human  populations, 
recent  findings  have  also  discovered  the  relationship  of 
genomic  reorganization  and  the  subsequently  generated 
genetic variation during cell fate changes. Lu et al. [86] have 
investigated the impact of altered replication timing on the 
CNV landscape during reprogramming. Approximately 40% 
of the human genome changes with regard to replication 
timing  between  human  induced  pluripotent  stem  cells 
(iPSCs) and their parent fibroblasts. Intriguingly, the CNV 
distribution shows a correlation with the changed timing 

profile. In particular, CNV gains tend to be located in the 
genomic  regions  that  switch  to  replicate  earlier.  This 
correlation  is  conserved  among  different  reprogramming 
methods.

Compared  with  cell  fate  changes,  replication  timing  is 
disrupted in many disease states, including cancer [87]. It 
has  been  noticed  that  numerous  alterations  to  the  repli-
cation program take place during carcinogenesis. One of the 
changes is the aberrant asynchronous replication of loci that 
replicate synchronously in normal cells. This phenomenon 
exists in not only cancer but also noncancerous cells [88-90]. 
This abnormal replication program apparently has a notable 
impact on genomic stability and thus increases the frequency 
of chromosomal rearrangements and CNVs. Recent findings 
have  indicated  that  aberrant  DNA  replication  timing  is 
involved in changes  in gene  expression, epigenetic  modi-
fications, and an increased CNV mutation frequency [91, 
92]. An analysis of 331,724 somatic copy number alterations 
(SCNAs) has shown that SCNAs increase in late-replicating 
regions  among  cells  of  different  cancer  types.  Like  the 
findings  in  iPSCs,  the  SCNA  distribution  is  related  to 
replication timing in tumor cells. In particular, amplification 
boundaries  tend to  be located  in  early-replicated  regions, 
whereas  deletion  boundaries  are  more  likely  to  reside  in 
late-replicated regions [93].

Integrated replication dynamic related with CNV 
instability 

In  the  study  of  Koren  et  al.  [75],  point  mutations  and 
CNVs showed different patterns in their correlations with 
replication  timing.  These  observations  may  reflect  the 
distinct mutational mechanisms between these two types of 
genomic  variants  and  suggest  complex  effects  of  DNA 
replication on CNV instability. We hypothesized that inte-
grated replication dynamics, which are not just early/late 
replication timing, contribute to CNV mutation. It has been 
reported that dividing the genome into early/late replication 
timing alone does not give the entire characteristics of DNA 
replication fork dynamics [72]. Actually, the timing transi-
tional  regions  represent  the  interactions  of  two  spatially 
dependent  chromatin  compartments,  which  are  DNA 
segments  with  low  rates  of  replication  fork  progression. 
Notably, slower fork speed and increased fork stalling have 
been found to be associated with cancer cells and result in 
CNV mutations [94]. Actually, Chen et al. [95] have con-
ducted  a  statistical  method,  estimating  replication  dyna-
mics,  and  observed  its  significant  association  with  CNV 
instability. Replication dynamics may be used as a measure 
of  the  progress  of  genome  replication  and  regional 
replication stress and provides novel insights into the roles 
of DNA replication in CNV mutagenesis.

Conclusion

Human genomic repeats play an important role in CNV 
mutation, genomic disorders, and genome evolution. Both 
low-copy genomic repeats (including LCRs and SDs) and 
high-copy repeats (including Alu, LINEs, and HERVs) can 
induce  CNV  formation  via  classical  DNA  recombination- 
based  mechanisms,  such  as  NAHR.  Furthermore,  paired 
repeats  (especially  those  in  the  inverted  orientation)  are 
even  more  crucial  as  substrates  to  form  DNA  secondary 
structures  and  cause  DNA  replication  fork  stalling  and 
replication stress. This will induce DNA replication errors 
and  subsequently  generate  CNV  mutations.  Besides  the 
primary structural features (e.g., the organization of repeat 
sequences  in  the  human  genome)  and  repeat-mediated 
secondary  DNA  structures,  higher-order  genomic  archi-
tecture (such as replication timing) is also involved in CNV 
instability.  Further  investigation  of  the  role  of  DNA 
replication dynamics in CNV mutagenesis will reveal more 
mutational mechanisms underlying genomic disorders and 
genome evolution.
