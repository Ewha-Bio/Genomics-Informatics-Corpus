Abstract 
D2GSNP  is  a  web-based  server  for  the  selection  of 
single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  within  genes 
related to human diseases. The D2GSNP is based on a 
relational database created by downloading and parsing 
OMIM, GAD, and dbSNP, and merging it with positional 
information  of  UCSC  Golden  Path.  Totally  our  server 
provides 5,142 and 1,932 non-redundant disease genes 
from  OMIM  and  GAD,  respectively.  With  the  D2GSNP 
web  interface,  users  can  select  SNPs  within  genes 
responding  to  certain  diseases  and  get  their  flanking 
sequences for further genotyping  experiments such  as 
association studies. 

Keywords:  SNP,  disease gene, association study 
Availability:  D2GSNP  is  freely  available  at  http://combio.

Summary 
The importance of single nucleotide polymorphism (SI\JP) 
analysis  has  been 
increased  continuously  as  the 
increasing  requirements  of  numerous  applications  in 
complex genetic disease, pharmacogenomics, population 
genetics,  and  evolutionary  studies  (Gray  et  at.,  2000; 
Marnetlos,  G.,  2003;  Mooser  et at.,  2003;  Hacia  et at., 
1999}. Currently over 10 million human SNPs have bB<en 
deposited into dbSNP database (Sherry et at., 2001) and 
many  companies  have  developed  whole  genome 
platforms for genotyping SNPs such as Affymetrix GeneChip, 
and lllumina BeadArray systems. Although the genotyping 
costs  are  rapidly  decreasing,  choosing  effective  SNF>s 
within  candidate  genes  is  still  important  and  critical  to

complex disease studies which needs numerous SNPs 
and large sample sets to maximize statistical power (Day, 
2005;  Hirschhorn, 2005). 

We  have  developed  a  web  server,  D2GSNP,  to 
support the selection of SNPs within human genes related 
to diseases (Fig. 1 ). Through the web interface, researchers 
are able to retrieve genes for queried diseases and SNPs 
within those genes intuitively.  For example, a researcher 
who is interested in several diseases with limited resources 
may  use  D2GSNP  to  pick  a  gene-dense  region  of 
chromosomes with a few clicks and select effective SNPs for 
his/her disease association study. To automate the selection 
step,  D2GSNP  constructed  a  local  relational  database 
which  integrated  four  public  databases,  OMIM  (Online 
Mendelian Inheritance in Man), GAD (Genetic Association 
Database),  dbSNP,  and  UCSC  GoldenPath.  The  web(cid:173)
based interface was implemented using JavaServer Faces 
(JSF) technology which has an advantage of constructing a 
clearly defined architecture by separating application logic 
and  presentation.  It  helps  the  rapid  construction  of  web 
services and lowers the cost of maintenance. 

Mapping diseases to genes 
Previously, there have been many alternative methods to 
identify human genes related to monogenic or complex 
diseases (Perez-lratxeta et at., 2002; Lopez-Bigas et at., 
2004; Tiffin eta/., 2005). We constructed highly accurate 
gene maps of diseases based on two manually curated 
databases including OMIM and GAD. OMIM is a catalog 
of human genes and genetic disorders (Hamosh  et at., 
2002)  and  GAD  is  an  archive  of  human  genetic 
association  studies of complex diseases and disorders 
(Becker eta/., 2004). In detail, we use OMIM Morbid Map 
which is the cytogenetic map location of disease genes 
described in OMIM. Among GAD genes, we used genes 
which  showed  at  least  one  positive  association  to  a 
disease. As a result, the number of disease-gene records 
and non-redundant gene counts in OMIM were 4,058 and 
5, 142,  respectively.  There  were  8,179  disease-gene 
records and 1 ,932 non-redundant genes in GAD. 

Mapping genes to SNPs 
In  order to map SNPs to disease genes,  chromosomal 
position of gene boundaries were retrieved from knownGene,

which  provides the information of protein coding genes 
based  on  proteins from  Uniprot andtheir corresponding 
mRNAs from  GenBank. To link knownGenes with gene 
symbols  from  OMIM  and  GAD,  UCSC's  table  kgXref 
(known  genes 
reference)  was  used. 
However, a few gene symbols from OMIM and GAD did 

to  external 

not match with those from kgXref. Some of these orphan 
gene  symbols  were  finally  linked  through  gene  alias 
table  based  on  Entrez  gene  which  covers  more  gene 
symbols.  Our  system  is  based  on  hg17  in  UCSC

number of SNPs in dbSNP, because some of them have 
not  been  mapped  to  a  unique  position  on  the  human 
genome yet. 

SNPs filtering and Data export 

The  general  purpose  of  D2GSNP  is  to  select  SI\JPs 
within  human  genes  related  to  user-queried  disease. 
SNPs  can  be  filtered  through  their  variation  types, 
validation status,  minor allele frequency,  and functional 
classes.  D2GSNP also provides flanking  sequences of 
selected  SNPs  for  genotyping  experiments.  Flanking 
sequences  of  SNPs  with  user-defined 
length  are 
provided  in  a  FAST A  format  file.  Fig.  1 D  shows  an 
example of filtered SNPs. Usage details of the D2GSNP 
are available in the on-line help page.
