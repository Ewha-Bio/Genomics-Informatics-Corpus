Abstract 
Even  though  it  represents  6-13%  of  human  genomic 
DNA, Alu sequences are rarely found  in coding regions. 
When in  exon region, over 80 % of them are found  in 3' 
untranslated 
(UTR).  Pseudogenes  are  an 
important component of human genome. Their functions 
are not clearly known  and  the mechanism of how they 
are  generated  is  still  debatable.  Both  the  Alu  and 
Pseudogenes  are 
in 
molecular biology. mRNA is thought to be a prime source 
of  pseudogene  and  active  research  is  going  on  its 
molecular mechanism. We report,  for the first time,  that 
mRNAs  containing  Alu  repeats  at  3'  UTR  has  a 
significantly high correlation with processed pseudogenes, 
suggesting a possibility that Alu containing mRNAs have 
a high tendency to become processed  pseudogenes.  It 
is known that about 10% of all  human genes have been 
transposed.  Transposed  genes  at  3'  UTR without  Alu 
repeat  have  about  two  processed  pseudogenes  per 
gene  on  average  while  we  found  with  statistical 
significance  that  a  transposed  gene with  Alu  had  over 
three  processed  Pseudogenes  on  average.  Therefore, 
we propose Alu repeats as a new and important factor in 
the generation of pseudogenes.

Introduction 

Alu  elements  have  been  amplified  in  primate  genomes 
through  an  RNA-dependent  mechanism,  termed  retro(cid:173)
transposition, and have reached a copy number in excess

of 500,000 copies per human genome (Deininger eta/., 
1999). Alu sequences represent around 6-13% of human 
genomic  DNA  (Mighell  et  a/.,  1997;  Boeke  1997).  Alu 
sequences  were  identified  in  5%  of  1616  human  full(cid:173)
length  eDNA,  82% of which were found  in  the 3'  UTR, 
14% lie in  the 5'  UTR,  and very rarely in  coding  region 
(Yulung eta/., 1995). Alu sequences are postulated to be 
retrotransposon that have been inserted into the human 
genome via  a  single-stranded  RNA generated  by  RNA 
polymerase  Ill  transcription,  but  the  mechanisms  and 
retrotransposition  are  very  poorly 
factors  about 
understood (Mighell eta/.,  1997; Moran eta/.,  1999).

Fig.  1.  The schematic diagrams of mRNA containing Alu  and 
the  steps  of the  generation  of processed  pseudogene  of the 
mRNA. (A) an mRNA containing Alu at 3' UTR. (B) SRP bound 
to Alu  at the 3'  UTR of mRNAs and  SRP brought itself to the 
LINE  product.  The  product adhered to  not only the  poly A of 
LINE,  but also the  poly A of near mRNA.  (C)  an  mRNA was 
inserted  into  human  genome  by  the  product,  therefore  the 
mRNA became processed pseudogene. 

Pseudogenes  are  regarded  as  disabled  copies  of 
genes that are known to have no important function and 
do  not code any full-length  proteins.  Pseudogenes are 
known  to  be  a consequence of gene duplication which 
can occur in two fundamentally different ways: firstly, by 
retrotransposition,  and  secondly,  via  the  duplication  of 
genomic DNA. Pseudogenes occurred by retrotransposition 
are  known  as  processed  pseudogenes  (Maestre eta/., 
1955;  Mighell  et  a/.,  2000).  Human  pseudogenes  on 
chromosome  21  and  22  first  had  been  discovered  by 
Gerstein group in USA (Harrison eta/., 2000). Over 8,000 

processed pseudogenes of human were identified by the 
same group.  20% of processed  pseudogenes are from 
highly expressed  ribosomal  proteins and  about  10%  of 
genes  are  known  to  be  originated  in  the  discovered 
processed pseudogenes. There are three factors affecting 
biogenesis  of  processed  pseudogenes.  First,  mRNA 
expression  level  is  the  most  deciding  factor.  Higher 
number  of  mRNA  transcripts  in  the  germ-line  cell  is 
proportional  to  the  higher chance  of retrotransposition 
compared to those genes that are less well transcribed. 
Second,  relatively  GC-poor  ribosomal  protein  (RP) 
genes  have  more  processed  pseudogenes  than  GC-rich 
RP  genes.  Third,  the  reverse-transcription  and  insertion 
processes  are  less  efficient for  longer  mRNA transcripts 
than shorter mRNA transcripts (Zhang and Madden 2003). 
Long  Interspersed  Nucleotide Element (LINE) has a 
few  functions  in  human.  For  examples,  autonomous 
retrotransposons,  processed  pseudogene  formation, 
exon shuffling and double-strand-break repair (Moran et 
a/.,  2001;  Ostertag  and  Kazazian,  2001;  Kazazian  and 
Goodier, 2002). Both Alu and mRNAs are transposed by 
the products of LINE because the products bind to polyA 
of not only LINE,  but also mRNAs and Alu. Although the 
mechanisms of transposition of both of Alu and  mRNAs 
are the same, the efficiency of the transpositions of Alu is 
over 300 times higher than that of mRNA (Esnault eta/., 
2000;  Kazazian,  2004 ). 

The  signal  recognition  particle  (SRP)  binding to Alu 
RNA brings the Alu  RNA into  proximity with  ribosomes 
and nascent L 1 proteins on L 1 RNA (Dewannieux eta/., 
2003; Kazazian, 2004 ).  This particle has been known as 
the factor of increasing the efficiency of transposition of 
Alu. This study reports a correlation between Alu that are 
included  in  the 3'  UTR of mRNAs and  the production of 
processed  pseudogenes.  We  support  that  hypothesis 
that  Alu  can  enhance  the  conversion  of  mRNA  into 
processed pseudogenes. 

Methods 
Dataset 
The list of processed  pseudogenes was downloaded in 
the website (http://www.pseudogene.org/). We removed 
about  2,000  processed  pseudogenes  originated  from 
ribosomal  proteins  among  all  the  8,000  processed 
Pseudogenes. This is because we only consider mRNA 
sequences. The list was published in the human genome 
draft  build  34.  Blastn  program  of  NCBI  was  used  to 
match  processed  pseudogene  sequences  and  the 
sequences  in  the  human  chromosome.  The  reference 
sequences  (RefSeq)  of NCBI  are  reviewed  sequences 
that  are  more  reliable  than  most  other  databases 

The Function of Alu  Inserted at the 3'  UTR of mRNAs  87 

(ftp://ftp.ncbi. nih.gov/refseq/H_ sapienslmRNA _Prot). 

The IDs of processed  pseudogenes are named after 
SwissProt (http://www.expasy.org/) IDs. We searched for 
the original mRNA sequences of processed pseudogenes 
by mapping IDs between RefSeq IDs and SwissProt IDs 
in the website; GeneCard (http://bioinformatics. weizmann. 
ac.il/cardsl). 

881  mRNA  sequences  were  matched 

to  2150 
processed pseudogenes. In previous studies, processed 
pseudogenes  were  searched  against  only  the  protein 
coding  regions  and  their  UTRs  (untranslated  region) 
were  not  considered  as 
they  converted  protein 
sequences to DNA sequences as data source. However, 
as most of Alu  sequences in mRNAs are in the 3'  UTR 
region,  we chose to  use  3'  UTR sequences of mRNAs 
from  RefSeq.  The  same  protocol  was  applied  to  the 
processed  Pseudogenes  for  the  3'  UTR  sequence 
regions. Additionally, for higher quality data, we removed 
3'  UTR  sequences  that  were  not  alignable  from  the 
RefSeq  and  processed  pseudogenes.  The  reason  why 
there are unalignable sequences between the two  sets 
(RefSeq  derived  and  processed  Pseudogenes)  is  that 
there  could  have  been  deletions  at  3'  UTR  of 
pseudogenes for the  last few hundred thousand  years. 
The  final  dataset  had  1214  processed  pseudogenes 
covered  by 581  mRNA species. 

The  following  are  the  stepwise  summary  of  the 

procedure: 

1)  RefSeq consisted of about 20,000 mRNAsequences 
and  processed  pseudogenes  were  about  6,000 
sequences  excluding  2,000  originated 
from 
ribosomal  proteins. 

2)  About  10%  of  RefSeq  mRNAs  contain  20,000 
processed  pseudogenes.  It is  consistent with the 
(Zhang  et  a/.,  2003).  The 
previous  study 
pseudogene database had only Swissprot IDs (e.g. 
chr2_075317.1,  chrY_075317.1,  and chrX_075317.1), 
however,  The Genbank format of RefSeq  had  no 
Swissprot  IDs.  Therefore,  we  make  the  simple 
java  source  that  compared  Swissprot  IDs  with 
RefSeq 
the  v.ebsite;  GeneCard 
(http://bioinformatics. weizmann.ac.il/cards/). As a 
result, 881  out of 2,000 RefSeq IDs were matched 
with 2,150 out of about 6,000.

and  pseudogenes  with  annotation  information  of

6)  If there are no matching regions between the two 
3'UTR sequences, we removed the 3'  UTRs from 
the  mRNA  and  pseudogene  data  sets.  When 
pseudogenes were discovered and published, the 
length criterion of them was 70% of the length of 
original genes.  If 3' sequence of pseudogene was 
the  pseudogene  had  no  3'  UTR; 
truncated, 
therefore, we made an alignment between 3'UTR 
of mRNA and that of pseudogenes. In this process, 
300  mRNAs  containing  936  pseudogenes  were 
excluded (resulting in 581  mRNAs). 

7)  Finally, 581  mRNAs and 1214 pseudogenes were 
in our dataset (on average 2.09 pseudogenes per 
mRNA) 

Significance analysis 
518  mRNAs  had  2.09  processed  pseudogenes  on 
average and  37 mRNAs (n) with Alu at 3'  UTR mRNAs 
had  3.11  pseudogenes  on  average;  therefore,  the 
average of the population of whole mRNAs was 2.09 (u), 
and the average of the population of mRNAs with Alu is 
3.11  (X).  And  also,  the  standard  deviation  of  the 

population  was  3.32  among  518  whole  niRNAs. 
Therefore, P value was 0.0336.

Results 
9.5%  of processed  pseudogenes  had  Alu  repeats,  but 
6.4%  of  mRNAs  of  reference  sequences  (RefSeq) 
supported  by  National  Center 
for  Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) had Alu over 100 bases at 3' UTR in 
our dataset (see Methods). The average length of Alu is 
known to be about 280bp and the previous study used 
the  minimum  length  of  Alu  as  around  60bp  and  the 
minimum of 70% identity (Weiner et at.,  1986; Yulung et 
at., 2003). In our study, we set a more rigorous threshold 
of 1 OObp and 70% identity. We found that there were few 
Alu  at  5'  UTR  in  both  mRNAs  and  the  processed 
pseudogenes because of short lengths of 5'UTRs (Table 
1) and it is consistent with a previous study (Yulung et at., 
1995).  On  average  an  mRNA  had  2.09  processed

We  have selected  30  random  mRNAs for each  data 
set from  two types  of data;  one  containing Alu  and  the 

other  not-containing  Alu  at  3'  UTR.  The  reason  for 
selecting  30  randomly  generated  mRNA  was  for  a 
comparison  under  same  conditions.  These  random 
mRNAs  removed  possible  bias  due  to  one  or  two 
mRNAs  containing  a great  number of pseudogenes.  If 
our result was due to such  bias by mRNAs containing a 
great  number  of pseudogenes,  normal  distribution  like 
Figure  1 would  not  be  shown  and  the  bias  would  be 
detected  in  the  distribution  statistics.  I.e.,  Figure  1 
showed  that  there  is  no  such  bias  by  unusually  high 
number of Pseudogenes. The random sampling process 
has been  iterated 500 times to eliminate statistical bias. 
We compared the randomly generated mRNAs between 
two  data  sets.  The  distribution  of  the  numbers  of 
Pseudogenes in the randomly generated sets of mRNAs 
is  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  mRNAs  containing  Alu  at  3' 
UTR had at most 80-100 processed pseudogenes while 
40-60  processed  pseudogenes  were  found

repeats. As shown in the distribution, in the range of 40 to 
100  pseudogene  copies  in  the  X-axis,  the  number  of 
pseudogenes without Alu decreases, but the number of 
those with Alu increases. After around 100 pseudogene 
copies, there are few processed pseudogene without Alu 
at 3' UTR while the number of processed pseudogenes 
with Alu at 3'  UTR rises to 200 pseudogenes copies.

Conclusion 
Alu  is one of the  representative transposons  in  human 
genome.  Alu  sequences  are  known  to  be  randomly 
inserted in human genome. Some of them are located in 
UTR  and  are 
the  host  mRNAs 
containing  the  Alu  repeats.  The  transposition  of  Alu 
element  is  known  to  be  300  times  more  efficient 
(Dewannieux et a/.,  2003) on  average than  that of any 
mRNAs  because  SRP  binding  at  Alu  is  suggested  to 
bring  itself  into  ribosome  and  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
products  of  LINE.  We  suspected  that  the  Alu  within 
mRNA  had  a  similar  effect  as  Alu  alone.  It  is  also 
suggested that once Alu is inserted in human genome, it 
stays in  the genome except in  the case of homologous 
recombination mechanism (Lander eta/., 2001; Kazazian, 
2004  and  personal  communication).  Therefore,  most 
processed  Pseudogenes  should  have the  same tract of 
Alu as that of the original functional genes. This tendency 
of stable  preservation  of Alu  is  the  foundation  of our 
experiment  in  calculating  the  tendency  of pseudogene 
generation when Alu  sequences are inserted in  mRNA. 
Few Alu repeats at 5'  UTR were found in our study, and 
it is consistent with previous survey (Yulung eta/., 1995). 
This  is  mainly  because  the  length  of 5'  UTR is  much 
shorter than  3'  UTR.  Consequently,  the  ratio of the Alu 
insertion was very low. Therefore, we used Alu at 3'UTR 
only.  Here,  we  put  forward  a  hypothesis  that  Alu  is 
another important factor that enhances the conversion of 
an  mRNA to a  processed  pseudogene.  An  mRNA with 
Alu element at 3' UTR has 1.53 times higher likelihood of 
becoming a pseudogene.
