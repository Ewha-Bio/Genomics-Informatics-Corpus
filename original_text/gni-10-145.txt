Chromatin  structure  and  dynamics  that  are  influenced  by  epigenetic  marks,  such  as  histone  modification  and  DNA 
methylation,  play  a  crucial  role  in  modulating  gene  transcription.  To  understand  the  relationship  between  histone 
modifications and regulatory elements in breast cancer cells, we compared our chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing 
(ChIP-Seq) histone modification patterns for histone H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/16ac, and H3K27me3 in MCF-7 cells with 
publicly available formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)-chip signals in human chromosomes 8, 11, 
and 12, identified by a method called FAIRE. Active regulatory elements defined by FAIRE were highly associated with active 
histone modifications, like H3K4me3 and H3K9/16ac, especially near transcription start sites. The H3K9/16ac-enriched genes 
that overlapped  with  FAIRE  signals  (FAIRE-H3K9/14ac)  were  moderately  correlated  with  gene  expression levels.  We also 
identified functional sequence motifs at H3K4me1-enriched FAIRE sites upstream of putative promoters, suggesting that 
regulatory elements could be associated with H3K4me1 to be regarded as distal regulatory elements. Our results might 
provide an insight into epigenetic regulatory mechanisms explaining the association of histone modifications with open 
chromatin structure in breast cancer cells.

Introduction

The  epigenetic  regulation  by  DNA  methylation  and 
post-translational modifications of histones without altering 
DNA  sequences  is  tightly  linked  to  the  gene  expression 
program  in  eukaryotic  genomes.  The  N-terminal  tails  of 
histones are subject to various types of modifications, such 
as  acetylation,  methylation,  phosphorylation,  ubiquitina-
tion , glycosylation, and sumoylation [1]. Dynamic changes 
by  histone-modifying  enzymes  affect  the  chromatin  acce-
ssibility  to  transcriptional  machinery  and  thus  modulate 
gene activation or silencing in diverse biological processes, 
such as transcription, DNA repair, development and diffe-
rentiation,  and  genome  stability  [2-4].  Moreover,  nucleo-
some positioning can also be controlled by specific histone 
modifications,  leading  to  alteration  of  cross-talk  among 
chromatin  structure,  exon-intron  architecture,  and  RNA 

polymerase II binding [5, 6]. Genomewide profiles of histone 
modifications with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequen-
cing  (ChIP-Seq)  have  revealed  the  characteristic  genomic 
distribution  and  the  association  of  gene  functions  and 
activities  in  eukaryotic  genomes  [7-12].  ChIP-Seq  is  a 
popularly used method to find genomewide protein binding 
sites with a high resolution by chromatin-immunoprecipi-
tation by massive DNA sequencing using high-throughput 
sequencing technology [11]. For example, trimethylated his-
tone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), which is catalyzed by trithorax 
complex, as well as histone acetylation (e.g., H3K9/16ac) 
are  usually enriched at  promoter  regions or  transcription 
start sites (TSSs) with open chromatin structure and posi-
tively correlated with gene transcriptional activation level. 
H3K4me1 is also found to be enriched at enhancer-associa-
ted regions. These modifications recruit the transcriptional 
machinery at target sites. Trimethylation of H3K27, cataly-

zed by polycomb group protein complex 2 (PRC2), contri-
butes  to  gene  silencing  by  promoting  chromatin  conden-
sation and chromatin stabilization and is likely to spread 
over larger regions around TSSs of silent genes. The signals 
of H3K9me3 are high in silent genes or repressed chromatin 
domains, such as heterochromatin. The comprehensive and 
comparative analysis of many histone modifications in the 
human  genome  demonstrates  that  the  combination  of 
several histone modifications shows a modular pattern and 
regulates transcriptional activation in a cooperative manner 
[13]. Interestingly, many loci of H3K27me3 are often co- 
localized  with  those  of  H3K4me3  around  TSSs  of  lowly 
expressed genes in stem-like cells, many of which are posi-
tioned at developmental regulators, including transcription 
factors and signaling proteins [14]. This suggests that the 
formation of a bivalent chromatin domain can be a signature 
of epigenetic memory and that programmed gene expression 
during  differentiation  is  dependent  on  chromatin  modifi-
cations [14].

The interactions of variations in the genome, epigenome, 
and  transcriptome  with  sensing  of  environmental  stimuli 
can  determine  phenotypic  plasticity.  Traditionally,  pheno-
typic variation has been explained primarily through genetic 
variation with sequence changes during evolution. However, 
epigenetic variations that are potentially sensitive to envi-
ronmental inputs can alter transcriptional activity, which in 
turn contributes to diversity of complex traits [15]. Such 
observations have been demonstrated in human cancers and 
plant  development,  such  as  floral  symmetry  and  vernali-
zation response (reviewed in [15, 16]). For example, silen-
cing of tumor suppressor genes, including p16, VHL, MLH1, 
APC,  and  E-cadherin,  is  associated  with  DNA  hyperme-
thylation in the gene promoters [17]. In relation to histone 
modifications, overexpression of EZH2, a histone H3K27 
methyltransferase, has been observed and positively corre-
lated with the progression of multiple malignancies, inclu-
ding  prostate  cancer,  breast  cancer,  lymphoma,  myeloma, 
colorectal  cancer,  endometrial  cancer, bladder  cancer, and 
melanoma [18]. In addition, generalized loss of H4K16ac 
and H4K20me3 is found in lymphoma and colorectal cancer, 
leading to transcriptional silencing [16].

Organization  of  genomic  DNA  into  higher-order  chro-
matin structures is involved in transcriptional regulation in 
eukaryotes [19, 20]. In particular, cis-regulatory elements 
complexes located in open chromatin regions, depleted of 
nucleosomes, are activated by the recruitment of transcrip-
tional machinery [19, 20]. Such active regulatory elements 
have been identified by formaldehyde-assisted isolation of 
regulatory  elements  (FAIRE)  technique,  a  simple  high- 
throughput  screening  method  to  isolate  and  map  active 
regulatory elements depleted of nucleosomes in eukaryotes, 

especially in clinical samples, by forming crosslinks between 
histones and DNA and subsequent utilization of hybridi-
zation of tiling microarrays or next-generation sequencing 
[21-23].  FAIRE  was  first  demonstrated  in  Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae,  where  formaldehyde-crosslinked  chromatin  im-
mediately upstream of genes was preferentially segregated 
into  the  aqueous  phase  in  a  manner  that  was  strongly 
negatively  correlated  with  nucleosome  occupancy  [21]. 
Results from both yeast and human samples showed that 
enrichment  of  regions  upstream  of  genes  was  positively 
correlated with transcription of downstream genes [21-23].
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and progressive disease, 
known as the most common cancer among women. For early 
diagnosis and prognosis, the development of tumor makers 
in breast cancer is important, but the markers for its early 
detection are rare [24, 25]. The most clinically useful tissue- 
based marker genes in breast cancer are steroid receptors, 
estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, and HER-2 [24, 
25]. The mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 are strong indi-
cators of breast cancer development, but their mutation is 
not common [25]. Except for genetic variation-based diag-
nosis, a comprehensive understanding of the gene expres-
sion program as well as epigenetic mechanisms is definitely 
required for the development of diagnosis markers and epi-
genetic therapies. We recently reported epigenetic regula-
tory mechanisms of gene expression with 3 different histone 
modifications  (H3K4me1,  H3K4me3,  and  H3K9/14ac)  in 
normal (MCF-10A) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cells [26]. In 
particular, we demonstrated the change of transcriptional 
activity, delineating differential enrichment of histone mo-
difications in both MCF-10A and MCF-7, which defines the 
functional regulatory elements in the genome with a cell 
type-specific chromatin environment [26]. To address the 
relationships between histone modifications and FAIRE and 
between FAIRE-related chromatin structure and transcrip-
tional activity, we analyzed FAIRE-chip [23], histone modi-
fication-ChIP-Seq  [26],  and  gene  expression  microarrays 
derived from MCF-7. Our result provides an understanding 
of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms with open chromatin 
in breast cancer cells.

Methods
Subjects

The FAIRE-chip data, covering human chromosomes 8, 
11, and 12, derived from MCF-7 cell lines, were downloaded 
from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
(GSE11579)  [23].  The  ChIP-Seq  data  (SRA045635)  of 
H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/14ac, and input DNA (mono- 
nucleosome digested with micrococcal nuclease) in MCF-7 
were obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) at the 

146

www.genominfo.org

National Center for Biotechnical Information (NCBI) [26]. 
The H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq data were generated with Genome 
Analyzer IIx (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according 
to  the  method  described  by  Choe  et  al.  [26].  The  gene 
expression data using the Human Genome U133Plus 2.0 
array platform (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) were 
collected from the GEO database (GSM276046-GSM276048 
for MCF-7) [27].

Peak identification and statistical analysis

The FAIRE-chip data were processed by using CisGenome 
[28] for normalization, signal detection, and identification of 
significant  FAIRE  regions.  The  26-bp  ChIP-Seq  reads  for 
H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9/14ac, H3K27me3, and input 
DNA were aligned to a human reference sequence (hg18) 
using  the  CASABA  1.6  program  (Illumina  Inc.),  and  the 
resulting  mapped  tag  counts  were  normalized  for  the 
comparative  analysis.  To  identify  peaks  enriched  with  a 
specific  histone  modification, 
the  Hypergeometric 
Optimization  of  Motif  EnRichment  (HOMER)  package 
version  3.2  [29]  was  used  with  the  following  options: 
approximate  fragment  length,  150  bp;  peak  size,  150  bp; 
minimum distance between peaks, 370 bp (equivalent to 
peak size × 2.5); Poisson p-value threshold relative to local 
tag  count,  0.0001;  default  false  discovery  rate  threshold, 
0.001; and center switch for centering peaks on maximum 
ChIP  fragment  overlap  and  calculating  focus  ratios.  The 
FAIRE sites coinciding with histone-modified peaks were 
defined when the distance between the center positions of 
FAIRE sites and histone-modified peaks was shorter than 
100 base pairs. The co-existing sites of FAIRE and histone 
modifications  were  plotted,  centered  at  the  genes’  TSSs 
using  seqMINER  with  k-mean  clustering  method  [30]. 
Expression  levels  of  genes  associated  with  the  FAIRE- 
histone-modified regions were examined, and gene ontology 
(GO)  enrichment  and  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and 
Genomes  (KEGG)  pathway  analysis  were  performed  by 
using the DAVID Functional Annotation Tool [31]. In addi-
tion, functional, enriched motifs in FAIRE-histone-modified 
regions were also found by using MEME suite [32] and the 
TOMTOM motif database [33]. 

Results 
Chromatin structure defined by FAIRE and histone 
modifications

The  chromatin  structure  was  analyzed  by  comparing 
genomic  regions  defined  by  FAIRE  with  histone  modifi-
cation sites detected by ChIP-Seq in a breast cancer cell line, 
MCF-7. Due to the limited information of FAIRE-chip data, 
we analyzed regions enriched in human chromosomes 8, 11, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

and  12. The  overall positions  of  regulatory  elements and 
histone modifications relative to TSS are depicted in Fig. 1A. 
The  k-clustered  pattern,  depending  on  their  enrichment 
level, showed that most H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac modi-
fications, known as active chromatin marks, were enriched 
near TSS, whereas H3K27me3, a repressive mark, was not. 
Many regulatory elements detected by FAIRE-chip were also 
located near TSS, reflecting that promoters are one of the 
major  nucleosome-free  sites.  The  relative  positions  of  3 
histone  modification  enrichments  (H3K4me1,  H3K4me3, 
and H3K9/14ac) were aligned to the center of FAIRE signals 
and overlapped within ± 1-kb regions from TSSs (Fig. 1B). 
The  H3K4me1  had  a  broader  spectrum  than  the  other  2 
modifications in ± 0.5-1.5-kb regions. These results implied 
that regulatory elements were highly correlated with active 
histone modifications and associated with open chromatin 
structure. 

A  total  of  2,804  regulatory  elements  from  FAIRE-chip 
data were identified by CisGenome analysis, and the number 
of ChIP-Seq peaks was calculated using HOMER program: 
18,938 for HK4me1, 4,516 for H3K4me3, 5,763 for H3K9/ 
14ac, and 3,324 for H3K27me3 (Table 1). The FAIRE sites 
were  located  in  especially  functional  element-related 
regions: promoters (32.2% of FAIRE sites analyzed), 4 kb 
upstream of promoters (3.2%), gene bodies (39.1%), and 
intergenic regions (25.4%). In particular, the highest enri-
chment of FAIREs in promoters could be identified by the 
normalization in quantitative comparison of FAIRE profiles 
(i.e.,  the  total  number  of  peaks/total  length  of  each  of 
genomic feature). We selected the overlapping regulatory 
elements of FAIRE signals with ChIP-Seq peaks and looked 
at  their  co-occurrence;  the  regulatory  elements  with 
H3K4me1 (FAIRE-H3K4me1) were 1,006; FAIRE-H3K4me3, 
1,000;  and  FAIRE-H3K9/14ac,  1,264.  Among  them,  334 
elements  showed  enrichment  of  both  H3K4me3  and 
H3K9/14ac (Fig. 1C). This relationship was further confir-
med  by  the  distribution  of  FAIRE-histone  modifications, 
shown  in  Fig.  1D.  The  highest  population  of  FAIRE- 
H3K4me3 and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac was observed immedia-
tely downstream of TSS (Fig. 1D). A weak enrichment of 
FAIRE-H3K4me1 elements was detected upstream of TSS, 
where a shoulder peak of FAIRE-H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 
was positioned. For example, 4 FAIRE regulatory elements 
of cyclin D1 (CCND1), involved in tumorigenesis as a cell 
cycle regulator, were located at the promoter and overlapped 
with  peaks  of  H3K4me3  and  H3K9/14ac  but  not  with 
H3K4me1 or H3K27me3 (Fig. 1E). Instead, the H3K4me1 
peaks in the CCND1 gene locus were expanded along the 
gene body and far upstream of TSS.

Gene expression and FAIRE-histone modifications

The gene expression program is tightly controlled by a 
dynamic chromatin environment, which epigenetic factors, 
like  histone  modifications  and  DNA  methylation,  play  a 
crucial role in determining. As shown in Fig. 1, we found the 
linkage of FAIRE regulatory elements with histone modi-
fication  profiles.  To  further  assess  the  FAIRE-histone 
modifications, the gene expression profiles for MCF-7 cells 
were  integrated  (Fig.  2).  From  the  overlapped  regulatory 
elements  determined  by  comparison  of  FARE-H3K4me1 
(1,006), FAIRE-H3K4me3 (1,000), and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac 
(1,264), we selected 229 genes associated with at least 2 of 
3 FAIRE-histone modification combinations. Scatter plots 
were produced to see how the expression level agreed with 

degree of histone modification (Fig. 2A-2C). The Pearson 
correlation coefficients between histone modifications and 
the  expression  level  of  genes  with  FAIRE  elements  were 
generally low. The highest coefficient was r = 0.50 for the 
pair of gene expression and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac (Fig. 2C), 
and the next was r = 0.4 for gene expression and FAIRE- 
H3K4me3  (Fig.  2B).  However,  FAIRE-H3K4me1  showed 
almost no correlation with gene expression level (r = －0.03) 
(Fig. 2A). To examine whether breast cancer-related genes 
were up-regulated in MCF-7 and appeared to have a high 
level of H3K9/14ac, as found in our previous study [26], we 
selected 68 genes, the expression levels of which ranked in 
the  top  30%  among  FAIRE-H3K9/14ac-associated  genes, 
and performed DAVID Functional Annotation analysis. We 
could isolate 29 functionally significant genes with p < 0.05:

displayed their involvement in the cell cycle, p53 signaling 
pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling path-
way, and pathways in cancer (Fig. 2E).

cription factors in FAIRE-H3K4me3 and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac 
sites.  The  binding  motifs,  such  as  CTCF,  MYB,  GFY-staf, 
ETS, and NRF1, were common in both FAIRE-H3K4me3 
and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac sites (Fig. 3A). However, NFY and 
RUNX motifs existed only in FAIRE-H3K4me3 sites, and 
the GATA3 motif was specifically detected in FAIRE-H3K9/ 
14ac sites. For FAIRE-H3K4me1 sites, AP-1/2, NF1, CTCF, 
AP-2, FOXA1, USF1, and MAFA motifs were identified (Fig. 
3B). Interestingly, the CTCF motif was commonly found in 
FAIRE-H3K4me1,  FAIRE-H3K4me3,  and  FAIRE-H3K9/ 
14ac. The genomewide positioning of regulatory elements 
marked  by  histone  modifications  is  illustrated  in  a  Venn 
diagram  (Fig.  3C-3E).  More  than  60%  of  the  FAIRE- 
H3K4me3 and FAIRE-H3K9/14ac regions carrying binding 
motifs were distributed at gene promoters; over 20% in the 
gene body; and at small portions far upstream of promoters 
(Fig.  3D  and  3E).  In  contrast,  the  population  of  FAIRE- 
H3K4me1 was highly enriched in gene body regions (66.4%) 
as  well  as  upstream  of  promoters  (31.3%)  but  almost 
negligible at promoters (2.3%) (Fig. 3C). 

Discussion

FAIRE has been known to enrich functional DNAs located 
in  DNase  I  hypersensitive  sites,  active  promoters,  and 
transcriptional  start  sites  [22].  The  enrichment  of  such 
regulatory regions in the aqueous phase might result in easy 
identification of genomic function without bias. Eeckhoute

et  al.  [23]  demonstrated  that  FOXA1-bound  enhancers 
defined by FAIRE in human chromosomes 8, 11, and 12 were 
closely related with cell-type specific chromatin remodeling. 
In addition, it was reported that FAIREs are highly asso-
ciated with DNase I hypersensitivity sites, RNA polymerase 
II, and TAF1 binding sites [22]. In combination with the 
information on these FAIRE regulatory elements in MCF-7 
cells,  we  analyzed  our  genomewide  histone  modification 
data (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K9/14ac) generated by 

ChIP-Seq [26]. It was shown that the H3K4me1 distribution, 
covering  the  entire  human  genome,  which  was  different 
from the pattern of H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac, was 53% of 
the gene body, 42% of the intergenic region, and 5% of the 
promoter. The promoter regions covered 54% and 52% of 
total  sequence  reads  in  H3K4me3  and  H3K9/14ac,  res-
pectively. The pair-wise colocalization analysis between 2 
histone modifications gave poor correlation coefficients in

H3K4me3-H3K9/14ac pair (r = 0.86) when the Pearson’s 
correlation coefficients were calculated with normalized tag 
counts detected within 1 kb upstream and downstream of 
TSSs [26]. The co-occupancy of FAIRE elements with his-
tone modifications is examined in Fig. 1, where it is clear that 
the promoters were the most abundant regulatory elements. 
Two  active  histone  modifications,  H3K4me3  and  H3K9/ 
14ac, were highly enriched within ± 1 kb from TSSs (Fig. 
1A),  and  a  comparative  analysis  showed  that  the  FAIRE

were  positioned  at  promoters  (Fig.  1D).  Such  epigenetic 
relationship between FAIRE and active histone modification 
marks has also been demonstrated in various cell types [22, 
23,  34-36].  As  exemplified  in  Fig.  1E,  H3K4me1  was 
differentially  positioned,  and  the  distribution  of  FAIRE- 
H3K4me1 sites was away from promoter regions, meaning 
that  FAIRE-H3K4me1  sites  might  be  distal  regulatory 
elements, such as enhancers [37].

The level of gene expression is also modulated, depending 
on  the  degree  and  position  of  various  kinds  of  histone 
modifications. As shown in Fig. 2A-2C, genes with FAIRE 
sites carrying H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac had relatively high 
expression levels compared to those with FAIRE-H3K4me1. 
Some genes related with breast cancer were up-regulated 
and showed high levels of H3K9/14ac in our previous study 
[26]. We therefore examined 68 genes with FAIRE-H3K9/ 
14ac sites with the DAVID GO analysis tool. These genes 
were significantly related with cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA 
damage, and signaling pathways, reflecting that their in vivo 
functions  are  essential  for  cell  survival  and  proliferation. 
Many  of  the  regulatory  sites  associated  with  histone 
modifications contained transcription factor binding motifs 
(Fig. 3A and 3B). CTCF binding sites, commonly found in 
FAIRE-H3K4me1,  FAIRE-H3K4me3,  and  FAIRE-H3K9/ 
14ac, are related to a function of insulators and involved in 
high-order chromatin  structure  [38], and  DNA demethy-
lation is also known to be coincident with FAIRE-related 
open chromatin [36, 39]. Using computational motif analy-
sis coupled with ChIP assay, Waki et al. [36] demonstrated 
that enrichment of a binding motif for nuclear family I (NFI) 
transcription factors was highly associated with adipocyte- 
specific  FAIRE  signals  as  well  as  active  histone  modifi-
cations,  like  H3K4me3  and  H3K27ac,  providing  a  global 
view of cell type-specific regulatory elements in the genome 
and an identification of transcriptional regulators of adipo-
cyte differentiation [35]. Such selective activities of regu-
latory  elements  were  also  reported  by  monitoring  the 
chromatin structure at FOXA1-bound enhancers defined by 
FAIRE [26]. This evidence supports the possibility that open 
chromatin  structures  are  subject  to  be  bound  by  many 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

transcription factors and that histone modifications function 
as markers for these factors to be recruited.

In conclusion, our results suggest that genomic regions 
defined by FAIRE in breast cancer cells should be highly 
associated  with  active  histone  modifications,  such  as 
H3K4me1, H3K4me3, and H3K9/14ac, and play a crucial 
role in controlling gene expression programs. This analysis 
will  provide  an  understanding  of  epigenetic  regulatory 
mechanisms with open chromatin in breast cancer cells.
