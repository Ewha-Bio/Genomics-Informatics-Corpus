The influenza A (H1N1) virus, also known as swine flu is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality since 2009. There is a need 
to  explore  novel  anti-viral  drugs  for  overcoming  the  epidemics.  Traditionally,  different  plant  extracts  of  garlic,  ginger, 
kalmegh, ajwain, green tea, turmeric, menthe, tulsi, etc. have been used as hopeful source of prevention and treatment of 
human influenza. The H1N1 virus contains an important glycoprotein, known as neuraminidase (NA) that is mainly respon-
sible for initiation of viral infection and is essential for the life cycle of H1N1. It is responsible for sialic acid cleavage from 
glycans of the infected cell. We employed amino acid sequence of H1N1 NA to predict the tertiary structure using Phyre2 
server  and  validated  using  ProCheck,  ProSA,  ProQ,  and  ERRAT  server.  Further,  the  modelled  structure  was  docked  with 
thirteen natural compounds of plant origin using AutoDock4.2. Most of the natural compounds showed effective inhibitory 
activity against H1N1 NA in binding condition. This study also highlights interaction of these natural inhibitors with amino 
residues of NA protein. Furthermore, among 13 natural compounds, theaflavin, found in green tea, was observed to inhibit 
H1N1 NA proteins strongly supported by lowest docking energy. Hence, it may be of interest to consider theaflavin for further 
in vitro and in vivo evaluation.

Introduction

Swine  flu,  also  known  as  influenza  A  (H1N1)  is  an 
infectious  disease  caused  by  RNA  viruses  of  the  family 
Orthomyxoviridae [1]. The H1N1 influenza virus arises due 
to the genetic recombination of genes from pig, human, and 
bird's H1N1 virus. It is unevenly spherical and is enveloped 
by a lipid membrane containing two glycoproteins namely 
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [1], which are 
responsible for viral infection [2]. HA helps in attachment of 
the viral strain on the host cell surface and is needed for 
infection, while NA is responsible initiation of viral infection 
by cleaving of sialic acid from glycans of the infected cell [3, 
4]. As these two glycoproteins are very essential for viral 
infection, these can be considered as excellent drug targets 
for the control of viral influenza, including H1N1. Although 

oseltamivir and zanamivir, two NA inhibitors approved for 
treatment and prevention of influenza [5, 6], more effective 
natural  medications  are  required  for  preventing  the  wide 
spread of swine flu.

There  are  many  plant  products  traditionally  used  for 
treatment  of  common  cold  that  provide  relief  from 
symptoms, including sore throat, sneezing, nasal conges-
tion and blocked nose [7]. Most of them are plant extracts 
and  the  exact  mechanism  of  action  are  yet  to  be  fully 
understood. The interaction profile of the active compounds 
of those plant extracts with viral proteins are need to be 
explored further, so as to design novel drugs of natural origin 
which could be possibly used effectively in prevention or 
treatment of H1N1 influenza without any adverse effects.

There  are  many  plant  products  traditionally  used  for 
treatment of influenza infection among them few natural 
compounds such as allicin, ajoene, andrographolide, baicalin,

carvacrol, catechin, coumarin, curcumin, menthol, eugenol, 
theaflavin, ursolic acid, and tinosporon have been reported 
to act against human influenza. The active constituents of 
the essential oil from the fruit of Trachyspermum ammi are 
thymol  and  carvacrol  [8].  The  essential  oil  has  strong 
antiseptic,  antispasmodic,  aromatic,  bitter,  diaphoretic, 
digestive, diuretic, expectorant, and tonic [9]. Also, it is used 
for the treatment of cold, cough, influenza, and asthma [10]. 
The Ocimum sanctum have great Ayurvedic treatment option 
for swine flu. The main chemical constituents of O. sanctum 
are  oleanolic  acid,  ursolic  acid,  rosmarinic  acid,  eugenol, 
carvacrol, linalool, and β-caryophyllene [11]. The antimi-
crobial  properties  of  O.  sanctum  make  it  useful  for  the 
prevention of novel H1N1 flu. Basil is safe, with no side 
effects and is great to prevent swine flu from spreading like 
wildfire [12]. Zingiber officinalis (ginger) has been reported as 
the natural remedies for swine flu prevention. The active 
compounds present in ginger are allicin, alliin, and ajoene etc 
and the compound allicin has been reported to have anti-in-
fluenza  cytokine  [13].  Allium  sativum  (garlic)  has  natural 
antiviral,  antibacterial,  and  immune‐boosting  properties  and 
has been used for hundreds of years to treat fungal, parasitic, 
and viral infections, and has anti-inflammatory properties 
and it is reported to kill influenza virus in vitro condition 
[14]. The active compound found in fresh garlic is ajoene. 
Curcumin,  the  active  constituents  of  Curcuma  longa  (tur-
meric),  is  reported  to  have  strong  antioxidant  with  anti‐
inflammatory, anti-viral properties [15]. Tinospora cordifolia 
having  active  compound  tinosporon,  tinosporic  acid,  and 
syringen prevent swine flu. The plant has immense potential 
for use against novel H1N1 flu since it is a potent immuno-

stimulant  [16].  The  principal  components  of  the  oil  of 
Mentha piperita are menthol (29%), menthone (20% to 30%), 
and  menthyl  acetate  (3%  to  10%).  Menthol  has  antimi-
crobial  and  antiviral  activity  and  also  observed  to  have 
virucidal against influenza, herpes, and other viruses in vitro 
[17]. Green tea is particularly rich in polyphenolic compounds 
like  theaflavin  and  catechins.  Catechin  and  theaflavin 
derivatives have shown pronounced antiviral activity. Green 
tea has the ability to enhance humoral and cell-mediated 
immunity and therefore, useful for preventing influenza by 
inhibiting flu replication using potentially directs virucidal 
effect [7, 18].

In the current study, we performed docking analysis to 
explore  the  atomic  interaction  and  molecular  mechanism 
between  13  plants  originated  active  compounds  such  as 
allicin, ajoene, andrographolide, baicalin, carvacrol, catechin, 
coumarin, curcumin, menthol, eugenol, theaflavin, tinospo-
ron, and ursolic acid against NA protein of H1N1. This study 
comprises of protein structure modeling of NA using Phyre2 
server  followed  by  structural  refinement  and  energy 
minimization  by  Yet  Another  Scientific  Artificial  Reality 
Application (YASARA) energy minimization server. Auto-
Dock4.2 tool was used to analyze the molecular interaction 
between NA with natural ligands.

Methods

Molecular modelling and structural validation of 
drug target

Phyre2  server  was  used  for  modeling  of  the  tertiary 
structure  of  NA  protein.  It  predict  the  three-dimensional 
(3D) structure of a protein sequence using the principles and 
techniques of homology modeling. Because the structure of 
a protein is more conserved in evolution than its amino acid 
sequence, a protein sequence of interest (the target) can be 
modeled with reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related 
sequence of known structure (the template), provided that 
the  relationship  between  target  and  template  can  be 
discerned  through  sequence  alignment  [19].  YASARA 
Energy Minimization Server [20] was employed for structural 
refinement and energy minimization of the predicted model. 
The  refined  model  reliability  was  evaluated  through 
ProCheck  [21],  ProSA-web  [22],  ProQ  [23],  and  ERRAT 
server [24].

Ligand preparation and molecular docking

Chemical  structures  of  13  natural  compounds  (allicin, 
ajoene, andrographolide, baicalin, carvacrol, catechin, cou-
marin, curcumin, menthol, eugenol, theaflavin, tinosporon, 
and ursolic acid) (Fig. 1), along with Chemical Abstracts 
Service  registry  numbers,  reported  in  the  literature  were 
retrieved from the PubChem database (Table 1) [25]. Both 
ligands and receptor molecule (H1N1 NA) was prepared in 
AutoDock4.2  program  [26].  AutoDock  is  used  to  predict 
small molecule to the receptors of known 3D structure. The 
ligand and target protein were given as input and the flexible 
docking was performed. The negative and low value of ∆G 
bind indicates strong favorable bonds between protein and 
the novel ligand indicating that the ligand was in its most 
favorable conformations [26]. Docking studies were carried

docking used by Kumar et al. [27] and Jagadeb et al. [28]. 

Visualization

The visualization of structure files was done using the 
graphical  interface  of  the  ADT  tool  and  the  schematic 
diagrams of protein-ligand interactions was prepared using 
the LigPlot [29].

Results and Discussion
Structural model and evaluation of NA receptor

NA  protein  of  H1N1  is  of  length  of  469  amino  acids 
sequence. Due to unavailability of experimentally determined 
structure  of  selected  NA  protein,  tertiary  structure  was 
predicted using the Phyre2 web server. Two templates were 
used to predict the 3D structures of NA protein (Fig. 2A), 
such as D chain of H5N1 NA in complex with oseltamivir 
(Protein Data Bank [PDB] ID: 2HU4) [30] and D chain of 
I223R  NA  mutant  structure  (PDB  ID:  4B7Q)  [31].  The 
predicted  structure  was  then  subjected  to  the  YASARA 
Energy Minimization Server for structural refinement. The 
total  energy  for  the  refined  structure  obtained  from  the 
YASARA Energy Minimization Server for NA was –194,023.8 
kJ/mol (score, –2.68) where prior to energy minimization, it 
was 25,622,682,021,439 kJ/mol (score, –7.17). The stereo-
chemistry of the refined model of NA (ProCheck analysis) 
(Fig. 2B) revealed that 94.4% residues were situated in the 
most favorable region and additional allowed regions and 
1.8%  of  residues  were  in  the  generously  allowed  region, 
whereas 3.8% the residues fell in the disallowed region of the 
Ramachandran plot (Fig. 2B). ProSA-web evaluation revealed 
a compatible Z score value of NA was obtained to be –4.89 
(Fig. 2C) which is well within the range of native conforma-

tions of crystal structures. The overall residual energies of 
the NA tertiary model were largely negative except for few 
peaks.  The  3D  model  of  H1N1  NA  protein  showed  a 
Levitt-Gerstein  (LG)  score  of  4.183  and  Maxus  0.060  by 
Protein Quality Predictor (ProQ) tool, implying a high accur-
acy level of the predicted structure. A ProQ LG score ＞ 2.5 
is  necessary  for  suggesting  that  a  model  is  of  very  good 
quality [24]. Similar assumptions were achieved using the 
ERRAT  plot  where  the  overall  quality  factor  for  NA  was 
observed  to  be  13.015  (Fig.  2D).  All  of  these  outcomes 
recommended the reliability of the proposed model.

Docking analysis of H1N1 NA with natural ligands

Few earlier in silico docking studies conducted against NA 
protein with zanamivir, oseltamivir and some natural ligands 
to recommend NA as a suitable drug target as well as the 
importance of natural inhibitors [32, 33]. In this study, we 
have predicted the structure of NA for docking analysis and 
found that all natural ligands (inhibitors) were docked in 
various conformations and with varying binding energies, 
the lowest energy conformation was selected. Upon docking, 
the high-ranked binding energies of modeled structures of 
NA (Table 2) proteins with natural ligands were obtained. 
All the 13 active natural compounds were found to interact 
with the receptor at the sialic acid site (Fig. 3A–M). In our 
docking study, among the 13 different ligands, theaflavin 
showed  the  lowest  binding  energy  (–5.21  kcal/mol)  and 
inhibition  constant  (150.69  μM)  for  the  protein  (H1N1 

NA)-ligand complex. Theaflavin was found to interact with 
the  amino  acid  residues  like  Arg118,  Asp151,  Asp  152, 
Arg193,  Asp199,  Asn344,  and  Arg430  of  NA  by  forming 
hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A). Theaflavin and catechins are two 
active  polyphenolic  compounds  found  in  green  tea  and 
reported to have pronounced antiviral activity [7, 18]. Due to 
its ability to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immunity, 
green tea is very useful for preventing influenza by inhibiting 
flu  replication.  Further,  ursolic  acid  showed  the  second 
lowest binding energy of –4.97 kcal/mol and an inhibition 
constant of 228.26 μM. During docking with the receptor it 
formed two hydrogen bond with Asn146 and Lys150 of NA 
(Fig. 3B). Ursolic acid is the active component of O. sanctum 
(tulsi) which has great ayurvedic treatment option for swine 
flu and due to its antimicrobial properties it useful for the 
prevention  of  novel  H1N1  flu  [17].  The  principal 
components  of  the  oil  of  M.  piperita  are  menthol  (29%), 
menthone (20% to 30%), and menthyl acetate (3% to 10%). 
Menthol  has  antimicrobial  and  antiviral  activity  and  also 
observed  to  have  virucidal  against  influenza,  herpes,  and 
other  viruses  in  vitro  [11].  In  our  docking  study,  the 
interaction binding energy of menthol and NA was observed 
to be –4.89 kcal/mol with inhibition constant of 259.37 μM. 
Further,  it  formed  four  hydrogen  bonds  with  amino  acid 
residues (Ile436, Ile149, Thr148, and Gly147) of NA (Fig. 
3C).
Further, other natural compounds like curcumin, reported 
to have strong antioxidant with anti‐inflammatory, anti-viral

essential oil from the fruit of Trachyspermum ammi [8] which 
is used for the treatment of colds, coughs, influenza, and

has  been  reported  to  have  anti-influenza  cytokine  [13]; 
ajoene  present  in  garlic  and  the  garlic  has  been  used  for 
hundreds  of  years  to  treat  fungal,  parasitic,  and  viral 
infections, and has anti-inflammatory properties and it is 
reported  to  kill  influenza  virus  in  vitro  [14].  Further, 
curcumin,  tinosporon,  eugenol,  catechin,  baicalin,  and 
andrographolide were also found to inhibit H1N1 NA with 
significant binding energy of in the range of –4.89 to –4.0 
kcal/mol (Table 2). The current in silico docking study, also 

observed all these natural ligands inhibits H1N1 NA with 
significant binding energy (Table 2).

All  natural  ligands  were  reported  to  block  influenza 
infection;  our  docking  study  also  revealed  the  in  silico 
validation for the possible mechanism of blocking. Most of 
the natural ligands were found to interact with H1N1 NA 
protein with effective binding energy and with amino acid 
residues  known  for  sialic  acid  binding.  This  interaction 
might prevent NA glycoprotein from interacting with host 
sialic  acid,  which  may  correlate  with  why  these  natural 
compounds are used to prevent or treat against influenza 
without any adverse effect.

In  conclusion,  different  natural/herbal  products  with

reduce the effects of the viral infection. Most of literature has 
given stress on using natural products of plant origin. It is 

the time for in silico validation of those plant products against 
viral  proteins before  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  study.  The  major 
antigenic  determinants  of  H1N1  virus  is  NA  which  is  a

in order to prevent or cure viral infection, there is need to 
identify  new  inhibitors  against  NA.  The  in  silico  docking 
approaches  used  in  this  study  revealed  the  molecular 
interaction of natural ligands against NA protein which may 
be of interest in designing new drugs from natural sources 
against H1N1. Out of all the inhibitors molecules, Theaflavin 
has  been  docked  with  minimum  binding  energy  of –5.21 
kcal/mol  by  forming  hydrogen  bonding  with  amino  acid 
residue of the receptor can be consider for in vitro and in vivo
