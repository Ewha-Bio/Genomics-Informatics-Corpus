Abstract

Angiogenesis  is  regulated  by  a  large  number  of  mole-
cules  and  complex  signaling  mechanisms.  The  G  protein 
Gα13  is  a  part  of  this  signaling  mechanism  as  an  endo-
thelial  cell  movement  regulator.  Gene  expression  analy-
sis  of  Gα13  knockout  mouse  embryos  was  carried  out 
to  identify  the  role  of  Gα13  in  angiogenesis  signaling 
during  embryonic  development.  Hypoxia-inducible  re-
sponse  factors  including  those  acting  as  regulators  of 
angiogenesis  were  over  expressed,  while  genes  related 
to  the  cell  cycle,  DNA  replication,  protein  modification 
and  cell-cell  dissociation  were  under  expressed.  Func-
-/- 
tional annotation and network analysis indicate that Gα13
embryonic  mice  were  exposed  to  hypoxic  conditions. 
The  present  analysis  of  the  time  course  highlighted  the 
significantly  high  levels  of  disorder  in  the  development 
of  the  cardiovascular  system.  The  data  suggested  that 
hypoxia-inducible  factors  including  those  associated 
with  angiogenesis  and  abnormalities  related  to  endothe-
lial  cell  division  contributed  to  the  developmental  failure 
of  Gα13  knockout  mouse  embryos.

Introduction
The  heterotrimeric  (αβγ)  G  proteins  (guanine  nucleo-
tide  binding  proteins)  are  molecular  switches  that  turn 
on  intracellular  signaling  cascades  in  response  to  the 
activation  of  GPCR  (G  protein  coupled  receptor)  by  ex-
tracellular  stimuli  (Oldham  and  Hamm,  2008).  These  G 
proteins  are  classified  into  four  different  families  (Gαs, 
Gαi/o,  Gαq/11  and  Gα12/13)  based  on  the  nature  of  the

Gα  subunit  present  in  the  heterotrimer  (Simon  et al., 
1991).  Gα13  belongs  to  the  well  studied,  albeit  poorly 
understood,  Gα12  family  (Riobo  and  Manning,  2005). 
Initially,  Gα12  and  Gα13  were  shown  to  induce  neo-
plastic  transformations  in  Rat-1  fibroblasts  when  acti-
vated  constitutively  (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et al.,  1994).  It 
was  only  later  that  the  true  function  of  Gα13  was  de-
termined  when  it  was  shown  that  Gα13,  but  not  Gα12, 
was  involved  in  the  LPA  (lysophosphatidic  acid)-induced 
activation  of  Rho  (Gohla  et al.,  1998).
    Subsequent  studies  identified  p115  RhoGEF  (Rho 
guanine  nucleotide  exchange  factor  1  or  also  known  as 
ARHGEF1)  as  the  guanine  nucleotide  exchange  factor 
involved  in  the  Gα13-mediated  Rho  activation  (Hart  et 
al.,  1998;  Kozasa et al.,  1998).  Gα12/Gα13  proteins  also 
activate  several  RhoGEFs  such  as  PDZ-RhoGEF  (Fuku-
hara  et al.,  1999),  Lbc-RhoGEF  (Dutt  et al.,  2004)  and 
LARG  (leukemia-associated  RhoGEF;  RhoGEF12)  (Suzuki 
et al.,  2003).  Once  activated  by  these  factors,  Rho  trig-
gers  a  cascade  of  cellular  signals  mediated  by  Rho-de-
pendent  kinase  (ROCK)  (Riobo  and  Manning,  2005).  Gα12 
and  Gα13  not  only  regulate  the  activity  of  low  molecular 
weight  G  proteins  of  the  Rho  family,  but  also  the  Na＋/H＋ 
exchanger  (Dhanasekaran et al.,  1994),  phospholipase  D 
(PLD)  (Plonk et al.,  1998)  and  inducible  nitric  oxide  syn-
thase  (iNOS)  (Kitamura  et al.,  1996).  Recently,  it  was 
shown  that  Gα12/Gα13  basally  regulated  p53  by  serine 
phosphorylation  via  mdm4  and  this  phosphorylation 
event  was  found  to  be  distinct  from  p53  phosphor-
ylation  elicited  by  genotoxic  agents  (Kim  et al.,  2007).
    Gα13  is  necessary  for  formation  of  actin  stress  fibers 
(Gohla  et al.,  1999),  focal  adhesion  (Buhl  et al.,  1995), 
increasing  Na＋/H＋  exchange  (Voyno-Yasenetskaya  et 
al.,  1994),  aggregation  of  platelets  (Huang et al.,  2007), 
differentiation  of  embryonic  cells  (Jho  and  Malbon, 
1997)  and  apoptosis  (Berestetskaya et al.,  1998).  In  the 
growth  factor-induced  cell  migration,  Gα13  promotes  the 
receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (RTK)  signaling  which  is  in-
dependent  of  GPCR  (Shan  et al.,  2006).  Gα13  and 
Rac-dependent  cell  migration  is  mediated  by  the  for-
mation  of  lamellipodia  (Dhanasekaran,  2006)  and  the 
polymerization  of  actin  to  the  leading  edge  of  the  cell 
(Radhika  et al.,  2004). 
    Gα13  is  also  involved  in  patterning  of  blood  vessels 
by  controlling  cell  movement,  shape  and  cell-cell/cell- 
matrix  interactions  of  the  endothelial  cells  (Ruppel et al., 

162 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  9(4)  161-172,  December  2011

2005).  Endothelial  cells  of Gα13  knockout  mice  lose  the 
ability  to  form  an  organized  vascular  system,  resulting  in 
intrauteric  death  (Offermanns et al.,  1997).  Moreover,  the 
head  mesenchyme  of  E8.5-E9.5  (embryo  stage  8.5-9.5 
day)  Gα13  homozygous  knockout  mouse  embryos  ex-
hibited  enlarged  blood  vessels  in  comparison  to  the 
small  vessels  found  in  the  wild-type  or  heterozygous 
embryos.  This  suggested  that  Gα13  activated  physio-
logical  angiogenesis  rather  than  vasculogenesis  (Offer-
manns  et al.,  1997).
    The  development  of  blood  vessels  from  differentiation 
of  endothelial  cells  is  called  vasculogenesis.  On  the  oth-
er  hand,  the  subsequent  sprouting  of  new  blood  vessels 
from  the  organized  vascular  system  is  referred  to  as 
angiogenesis.  Angiogenesis  is  regulated  by  a  number  of 
stimulators  and  inhibitors  in  sophisticated  ways.  Once 
activated,  epithelial  cells  begin  to  degrade  the  ex-
tracellular  matrix  and  loosen  the  cell-cell  adhesion.  The 
adhesion  molecules  can  then  help  in  the  sprouting  of 
new  blood  vessels  that  are  subsequently  connected  to 
existing  vessels  and  stabilized  with  remolded  tissues 
(Pandya  et al.,  2006).
    During  embryonic  development,  Vegf  (vascular  endo-
thelial  growth  factor)  is  a  key  activator  of  angiogenesis 
as  well  as  earlier  vasculogenesis.  The  expression  of 
Vegf  is  modulated  by  numerous  cytokines  such  as  inter-
leukin  1  beta  (IL1β)  (Maruyama et al.,  1999),  CD40  (Tai 
et  al.,  2002),  tumor  necrosis  factor  alpha  (TNFα) 
(Nabors  et al.,  2003),  transforming  growth  factor  beta 
(TGFβ)  (Wang et al.,  2004)  and  growth  factors  such  as 
fibroblast  growth  factor  2  (FGF2)  (Seghezzi et al.,  1998). 
Hypoxia-initiated  angiogenesis  also  occurs  through  the 
Vegf  signaling  pathway  (Shweiki et al.,  1992).  Angiogen-
esis  is  thus  important  to  both  physiological  and  patho-
logical  conditions  such  as  embryonic  development,  can-
cer  cell  metastasis,  wound  healing,  etc.
    Microarray analysis of whole genome expression of Gα13 
knockout  mouse  embryos  was  carried  out  in  order  to 
identify  the  role  of  Gα13  in  signaling  networks  during 
mouse  embryonic  development.  Whole  genome  ex-
pression  data  highlighted  significantly  increased  levels  of 
disorder  in  the  development  of  the  physiological  sys-
tems.  Considering  the  importance  of  angiogenesis  in 
embryonic  or  tumor  development,  it  should  be  very  cru-
cial to understand the link between angiogenesis and Gα13- 
mediated  signaling.

Methods

Generation  of  Gα13  knockout  mouse  embryos

The  generation  of Gα13  knockout  mouse  embryos  is  de-
scribed  elsewhere  (Offermanns et al.,  1997).  Briefly,  the 

first  two  exons  of  the  Gα13  clone  isolated  from  a 
129/Sv  mouse  genomic  λ phage  library  were  replaced 
with  neo  gene  from  the  plasmid  pMC1neo  Poly  A 
(Stratagene,  USA).  The  targeting  vector  contained  a  1.4 
kb-upstream  sequence  as  the  5'  arm,  with  8  kb  of  in-
tron  sequence  and  the  second  exon  as  the  3'  arm. 
Gene  targeting  was  carried  out  in  the  mouse  embryonic 
stem  (ES)  cell  line  CJ7.  Correctly  targeted  ES  cell  clones 
were  injected  into  C57BL/6  blastocysts  and  chimeras 
were  bred  with  C57BL/6  and  129/Sv  mice  to  generate 

heterozygous  animals  (Ramírez-Solis et al.,  1993).  Hete-

rozygous  mice  were  interbred  to  generate  homozy-
gous-deficient  (knockout)  embryos  in Gα13  or  wild-type 
littermate  embryos  for  the  controls.  All  procedures  in-
volving  mice  were  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the 
guidelines  of  the  ethical  committee  of  Ajou  University.

Genotyping  of  mutant  mouse  strains

Total  RNA  was  purified  from  the  embryo  or  from  the 
yolk  sac  and  used  for  RT-PCR  analysis  with Gα13-spe-
cific  primers.  Oligonucleotides  used  for  PCR  reaction 
were  5'-AGC  AGC  GCA  AGT  CCA  AGG  AGA  TCG-3' 
and  5'-AGG  AAC  ACT  CGA  GTC  TCC  ACC  ATC  C-3'. 
The  genotypically  confirmed  knockout  embryo  sample 
was  directly  compared  to  the  wild-type  littermate  em-
bryo  sample.

DNA  microarray

Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  knockout  and  wild-type 
littermate  embryos  using  the  Trizol  method  (Invitrogen, 
USA)  and  DNA  microarray  analysis  was  performed  using 
the  Affymetrix  in situ  synthesized  GeneChip  as  de-
scribed  on  the  website  of  the  Alliance  for  Cellular  Signa-
ling  (AfCS:  http://www.signaling-gateway.org/data/cgi-bin/ 
ProtocolFile.cgi/afcs_PP00000174.pdf?pid=PP00000174). 
Briefly,  total  RNA  was  prepared  from  embryos  with  the 
use  of  Trizol  (Life  Technologies,  USA).  After  the  Trizol 
extraction,  cleanup  was  carried  out  with  a  Qiagen 
RNeasy  Mini  Kit  (Qiagen,  USA).  Reverse  transcription 
was  performed  to  generate  double-stranded  cDNAs  with 
the  use  of  SuperScript  polymerase  (Life  Technologies) 
and  an  oligo-(dT)24  primer  with  a  T7  RNA  polymerase 
promoter  (Genset,  USA).  An  RNA  Transcript  Labeling  Kit 
(Enzo  Diagnostics,  USA)  was  used  for  the  production  of 
hybridizable  biotin-labeled  RNA  targets  by in vitro  tran-
scription  from  T7  RNA  polymerase  promoters.  The 
cDNA  prepared  from  total  RNA  was  used  as  a  template 
in  the  presence  of  a  mixture  of  unlabeled  ATP,  CTP, 
GTP,  and  UTP  and  biotinylated  CTP  and  UTP.  The  bio-
tinylated  cRNA  was  hybridized  for  16  h  at  40oC  to  a  set 
of  oligonucleotide  arrays  in  the  GeneChip  Fluidics 

The  Knockout  of  Gα13  Perturbs  Angiogenesis  and  Hypoxia 163

Station  400  (Affymetrix,  USA).  After  hybridization,  the 
GeneChip  array  underwent  a  series  of  stringency  wa-
shes  and  was  stained  with  streptavidin-conjugated  phy-

coerythrin.  Arrays  were  scanned  with  a  Hewlett-Pac-
kard  Scanner.

Data  analysis

The  GeneChip  was  scanned  and  information  was  ex-
tracted  using  the  GeneChip  Analysis  Suite  5.0  (Affymet-
rix).  The  output  log2  ratio  represents  the  fold  difference 
between 
the  knockout  and  control  samples.  The 
GeneChip  Analysis  program  gives  a  present/absent  (P/A) 
call  for  each  spot  on  the  array  based  on  a  predeter-
mined  signal-to-noise  ratio,  along  with  a  not  changed/in-
crease/marginal  increase/decrease/marginal  decrease  (NC/ 
I/MI/D/MD)  call  for  the  comparison.  The  genes  that  had 
an  NC/MI/MD  call  were  filtered  out.  MeV  program 
(MultiExperiment  Viewer:  http://www.tm4.org/mev.html) 
was  used  for  clustering  and  Ingenuity  Pathway  Analysis 
(http://www.ingenuity.com)  for  functional  analysis.  All  rel-
evant  microarray  data  have  been  deposited  in  MIAME 
(Minimum  Information  About  a  Microarray  Experiment) 
compliant  format  in  the  public  repository,  ArrayExpress, 
under  accession  number  E-MTAB-614.

Functional  annotation  and  network  analysis

For  functional  enrichment  analysis,  we  used  the  Cyto-
scape  plugin,  BiNGO  version  2.44.  We  selected  GO 
Biological  Process  ontology  file  to  annotate  the  GO  term 
and  filtered  out  only  significant  GO  terms  (p-value＜ 
0.0001)  according  to  Hypergeometric  test  in  BiNGO.  We 
generated  the  hypothetical  network  using  23  hypoxia-in-
duced  genes  listed  in  Table  1.  The  first  interaction 
neighbors  were  obtained  from  human  protein-protein  in-
teraction  database,  BioGrid  (http://www.thebiogrid.org). 
To  identify  the  direct  regulation  of  HIF1α  (hypoxia-in-
ducible  factor  1,  alpha  subunit)  to  the  hypoxia-induced 
genes,  we  performed  a  literature  search  which  proved 
the  binding  of  HIF1α  to  the  promoters  of  the  genes.  To 
reconstruct  a  compact  network,  first  neighbors  of  hypo-
xia-induced  genes  were  removed,  excluding  the  neigh-
bors  that  interacted  with  two  or  more  hypoxia-induced 
genes.  Numbers  of  neighbors  including  removed  neigh-
bors  were  represented  by  size  of  the  nodes.

Quantitative  real-time  PCR  (QRT-PCR)

QRT-PCR  was  performed  on  the  GeneAmp  5700  Se-
quence  Detection  System  (Applied  Biosystems,  USA)  by 
monitoring  of  the  increase  in  fluorescence  caused  by 
the  binding  of  SYBR  Green  to  double-stranded  DNA. 
Total  RNA  was  prepared  from  frozen  mouse  retinas  with 
the  use  of  Trizol  reagent  (Life  Technologies).  To  prepare 
cDNA  templates,  50-100  ng  of  total  RNA  was  mixed 
with  5.5  mM  MgCl2,  0.5  mM  each  dNTP,  2.5μM  ran-
dom  hexamer,  0.4  unit/μl  RNase  inhibitor,  and  1.25 
units/μl  MultiScribe  reverse  transcriptase  from  TaqMan 

Reverse  Transcription  Reagents  (Applied  Biosystems). 
RT  was  incubated  at  25oC  for  10  min  and  at  48oC  for 
30  min  and  inactivated  at  95oC  for  5  min.  The  PCR  pri-
mers  were  designed  with  primer  express  software  (Ap-
plied  Biosystems),  and  their  specificity  in  gene  amplifi-
cation  was  confirmed  by  measurement  of  the  size  and 
purity  of  the  PCR  product  by  4%  NuSieve  agarose  gel 
electrophoresis.  For  a  50-μl  PCR,  4  μl  cDNA  template 
was  mixed  with  300  nM  each  of  forward  and  reverse 
primers  and  2×  SYBR  Green  PCR  Master  Mix  (Applied 
Systems).  The  reaction  was  first  incubated  at  50oC  for 
2  min,  then  at  95oC  for  10  min,  followed  by  40  cycles 
of  95oC  for  15  s  and  60oC  for  1  min.  Each  gene-specific 
PCR  was  performed  in  triplicate.

-/- 
tering  result  of  significantly  regulated  genes  in  the Gα13
mouse  embryonic  development  st  ages  is  shown  in  Fig. 
1A.  Using  the  K-Means  method,  five  expression  clusters 
were  obtained  (Fig.  1B).  Most  genes  in  the  cluster  A  of 
Fig.  1B  were  continually  and  remarkably  upregulated 
from  9.5  day  to  10.5  day.  Table  1  shows  functions  of 
genes  in  cluster  A.  Vegf  (In  our  QRT-PCR  experiment, 
Vegf was  upregulated  by  5.7  fold  at  10  day;  data  not 
shown)  and  Kdr  (kinase  insert  domain  receptor;  Vegf  re-
ceptor)  are  key  regulators  of  angiogenesis.  Igfbp3  (insu-
lin-like  growth  factor  binding  protein  3)  (Granata  et al., 
2007),  F2  (coagulation  factor  2)  (Tsopanoglou  and 
Maragoudakis,  1999)  and  Adm  (adrenomedullin)  (Ribatti 
et al.,  2005)  induce  angiogenesis.  Anxa2  (annexin  A2) 
regulates  angiogenesis  (Ling  et al.,  2004),  and  Bnip3 
(BCL2/adenovirus  E1B  interacting  protein  3)  is  related  to 
the  reactivity  of  Vegf  (Giatromanolaki  et  al.,  2007). 
Foxo3a  (forkhead  box  O3a)  (Potente et al.,  2005)  inhibits 
tube  formation.  In  addition,  other  molecules  related  to 
cell  differentiation  and  cell  adhesion  could  get  involved 
in  the  formation  of  blood  vessels.

at  all  time  points  were  analyzed  by  IPA  program  and  as 
a  result  we  obtained  4  major  networks.  The  top  func-

given  in  Table  2.  The  network  of  9.5d  Gα13
was  related  to  cell  cycle,  cancer,  and  cellular  function 
and  maintenance.  The  names  of  the  molecules  in  this 
network  which  are  related  to  cell  cycle  include  Ccnd 
(cyclin  D1),  Cdkn1C  (cyclin-dependent  kinase  inhibitor 
1C),  Dcn  (decorin),  Igf1  (insulin-like  growth  factor  1),

and  Smarca2  (SWI/SNF  related,  matrix  associated,  actin 
dependent  regulator  of  chromatin,  subfamily  a,  member 
2).  Subsequently,  the  network  of  9.75d  contained  mole-
cules  involved  in  protein  synthesis,  degradation  and 
cancer,  such  as  Adrm1  (adhesion  regulating  molecule  1), 
Fbxo8  (F-box  protein  8),  Nedd8  (neural  precursor  cell 
expressed  developmentally  down-regulated  8),  Psmb3 
(proteasome  subunit,  beta  type  3),  Psmb5,  Psmc2, 
Psmd14,  UbE2D2  (ubiquitin-conjugating  enzyme  E2D  2) 
and  UbE2E1.  On  the  other  hand,  10d  network  consisted 
of  Adm,  Bsg  (basigin),  CtsL2  (cathepsin  L2),  Ets2  (v-ets 
erythroblastosis  virus  E26  oncogene  homolog  2),  Igfbp2, 
Postn  (periostin,  osteoblast  specific  factor),  Spp1  (se-

cellular  movement.  In  addition,  this  particular  network 
consisted  of  the  molecules  associated  with  skeletal/

highly  enriched.  Based  on  these  results,  we  hypothe-
-/-  mouse  embryos  suffered  hypoxic  con-
sized  that Gα13
ditions  during  developmental  stage  9.5-10.5  days,  where 
hypoxia-induced 
responses  such  as  angiogenesis, 
apoptosis,  transport  and  cell  migration  were  increased.

Biological 
pressed  genes  in Gα13

functions  enriched  with  over-ex-

-/- mouse  embryos

To  identify  the  functional  enrichment  of  upregulated 
-/- 
genes  in  any  of  the  developmental  stages  of  Gα13
mouse  embryos,  we  generated  the  GO  term  tree  using 
BiNGO  plugin  of  Cytoscape  program.  We  arranged  the 
node  representing  each  function  to  the  hierarchical 
structure.  We  then  categorized  the  functions  into  12 
groups  such  as  response  to  wounding,  metabolic  proc-
ess,  regulation  of  transcription,  angiogenesis,  macro-
molecule  metabolic  process,  apoptosis,  signaling  path-
way,  lipid  metabolic  process,  transport,  cell  migration, 
catabolic  process  and  embryonic  development  (repre-
sented  as  black  boxes  in  Fig.  2).  In  particular,  we  ob-
served  that  the  angiogenesis-related  genes  were  highly 
-/-  mouse  embryos  as  indicated  by 
expressed  in  Gα13
strong  enrichment  of  angiogenesis  and  their  upstream 
GO  terms.  We  also  found  that  biological  functions  asso-
ciated  with  apoptosis,  cell  migration  and  transport  that 
are  known  to  be  hypoxia-induced  responses  were  also 

Gα13-deletion  mimics  hypoxia-induced  response 
in  Gα13  knockout  embryos

A  hypoxic  condition  such  as  newly  formatted  tissues  or 
cancer  cells  needs  new  blood  vessels,  a  source  of  en-
ergy  and  oxygen  supply.  In  order  to  ascertain  whether 
hypoxia-related  genes  were  regulated,  we  looked  for 
those  genes  that  are  known  to  be  induced  under  hy-
poxic  conditions.  The  hypoxia-related  genes  are  shown 
in  bold  and  their  references  are  listed  in  Table  1.  Genes 
associated  with  angiogenesis,  glucose  transporters,  and 
ion  regulators  were  among  those  that  were  significantly 
-/-  mouse  embryos  at 
upregulated.  For  example,  in  Gα13
all  the  time  points  tested,  the  expressions  of  Adm, 
Bhlhb2  (basic  helix-loop-helix  domain  containing,  class 
B,  2), Bnip3, Ccng2  (cyclin  G2), Ddit4  (DNA-damage-in-
ducible  transcript  4)  and  Egln1  (egl  nine  homolog  1) 
were  higher  when  compared  to  normal  embryos.  Our 
-/-  mouse  was  exposed  to 
finding  supports  that  the Gα13
hypoxic  conditions  from  9.5-10.5  days.  We  next  per-
formed  network  analysis  to  show  the  interactive  relation-

log2  ratio  of  0.5  or  greater  in  any  of  developmental  days  were  used  to  perform  functional  annotation  analysis.  The  brightness 
of  node  colors  represents  the  p-value  indicating  significance  of  functional  enrichment.  The  cellular  processes  were  catego-
rized  into  several  groups  as  indicated  by  black  boxes.

ships  of  hypoxia-induced  genes  listed  in  Table  1.  We  in-
vestigated  the  interactions  between  hypoxia-induced 
genes  and  their  first  neighbors,  but  displayed  only  the 
number  of  interacting  neighbors.  The  network  indicates 
that  most  of  hypoxia-induced  genes  over-expressed  in 
-/-  embryonic  mouse  were  mainly  transcriptionally 
Gα13
regulated  by  HIF1α  directly  or  indirectly  as  depicted  in 
Fig.  3  (In  our  QRT-PCR  experiment,  Hif1α  was  down 
regulated  by  3  fold  at  10  day;  data  not  shown).  We  also 
observed  that  several  genes  in  network  such  as Hspa1A 
(heat  shock  70  kDa  protein  1A),  Igfbp3, Vegf, Kdr  and 
Anxa2  interacted  with  several  neighbor  genes,  suggest-
ing  that  these  genes  play  a  potent  role  in Gα13  knock-
out-induced  hypoxic  responses.  Moreover,  a  compar-
ison  of  our  microarray  data  with  another  published  data 
(Accession  No.  E-MEXP-392  in  ArrrayExpress  database: 
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/microarray-as/aer/result?queryFor= 
Experiment&eAccession=E-MEXP-392)  suggested 
that 
apart  from  hypoxia-related  genes  such  as Egln1,  genes 
that  were  responsible  for  angiogenesis  such  as  Vegf 
were  upregulated  in  a  similar  manner  as  that  of  embry-
onic  stem  cells  under  hypoxic  conditions  (Fig.  4),  sug-
-/-  embryonic  cells,  hypoxic  con-
gesting  that  in  Gα13
dition  might  exist  similarly.

A  number  of  transcription  and  translation  factors 
were  downregulated  in  Gα13  knockout  embryos

Functions  of  genes  that  have  more  than  50%  down-
regulation  in  the  expression  level  among  filtered  genes 
are  summarized  in  Table  3.  The  expression  of Gα13 
(also  known  as  Gna13)  at  9.5d,  9.75d,  10d  and  10.5d 
(log2  ratio  values  of  -1.3,  -1.8,  -2.3  and  -2.8  re-
spectively)  was  confirmed.  A  number  of  transcription 
and  translation  factors  were  downregulated.  Cell  cycle 
regulators  including  DNA  replication  effectors  were  also 
downregulated.  Some  of  the  important  down-regulated 
genes  were  Ccnd1, Ccnd2, Ranbp1  (RAN  binding  pro-
tein  1), Ranbp5  (RAN  binding  protein  5), Cdc6  (cell  divi-
sion  cycle  6  homolog), Cdc34  (cell  division  cycle  34  ho-
molog),  Fen1  (flap  structure-specific  endonuclease  1), 
Sox3 (SRY-box  3), etc.  Ccnd1  and  Ccnd2  modulate  the 
matrix  metalloproteinase  activity  and  cell  motility.  Ccnd1 
is  also  involved  in  the  expression  of  Rac1  (ras-related 
C3  botulinum  toxin  substrate  1)  that  stimulates  the  dor-
sal  ruffle  formation  acell  motility  (Arato-Ohshima  and 
Sawa,  1999;  Manes et al.,  2003).  Rangap1  (Ran  GTPase 
activating  protein  1)  mediated  by  Ran  (member  RAS  on-
cogene  family)  regulates  cell  division  (Arnaoutov  and 
Dasso,  2003).  Ran  activity-involved  proteins  such  as 
Ranbp1,  Ranbp5  and  Rangnrf  (Ran  guanine  nucleotide 
release  factor)  were  marginally  downregulated.  Ppm1g 
(protein  phosphatase  1G,  magnesium-dependent,  gam-
ma  isoform),  Rcc2  (regulator  of  chromosome  con-
densation  2),  Kpna2  (karyopherin  alpha  2),  Cdc6,  Cdc34, 
Fen1  and  Rrm2  (ribonucleotide  reductase  M2  polypep-
tide)  participate  in  the  processing  of  cell  division. 
Cacybp  (calcyclin  binding  protein)  is  involved  in  the  cal-
cium-dependent  protein  degradation  process  (Filipek, 
2006).  Ubfd1  (ubiquitin  family  domain  containing  1),

creased  genes  which  may  be  affected  by  hypoxia  were 
used  to  construct  the  hypothetical  network.  First  neighbors 
were  omitted  on  the  basis  of  interaction  with  only  one  hy-
poxia-induced  gene  and  number  of  neighbors  was  repre-

(nestin)  (Yang et al.,  1997),  Nr2f1  (nuclear  receptor  sub-
family  2,  group  F,  member  1)  (Armentano et al.,  2006), 
Sox3  (Collignon  et al.,  1996)  and  Arg1  (arginase,  liver) 
(Yu  et al.,  2002)  are  required  for  the  development  of 
mouse  central  nervous  system.

Discussion
The  G  protein  Gα13  plays  a  key  role  in  the  mouse  em-
bryonic  development.  Several  lines  of  evidence  indicate 
that Gα13  knockout  mice  die  due  to  the  abnormality  of 
angiogenesis,  but  the  molecular  mechanism  has  not  yet 
been  completely  elucidated  (Offermanns et al.,  1997).  In 
-/-  deletion  in 
order  to  determine  the  outcome  of  Gα13
mouse  embryos,  whole  gene  expression  was  analyzed 
using  the  DNA  microarray  method.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1A 
and  Table  1,  the  genes  that  participated  in  the  proc-
esses  of  cell  differentiation,  cell-cell  adhesion  and  an-
giogenesis,  were  all  continually  overexpressed  from  9.5d 
to  10.5d.  As  shown  in  Table  3,  downregulated  genes 
were  related  to  the  cell  cycle,  DNA  replication,  protein 
modification  and  cell-cell  dissociation.  This  gene  level 
analysis  supported  the  morphological  observation  of 
blood  vessel  sprouting  and  branching  defects  due  to Gα13 
deficiency.  The  lack  of  oxygen  as  well  as  the  energy 
and  nutrient  depletion  due  to  vascular  system  defects 

caused  the  abnormality  of  organ  development  in  devel-
oping  mouse  embryos.  Blood  vessels  were  formed  from 
-/-  embryos  grew,  but  division, 
progenitor  cells  as  Gα13
movement  and  migration  of  endothelial  cells  of  blood 
vessels  that  are  dependent  on  the  Gα13  signaling  path-
way  did  not  occur,  thereby  inhibiting  angiogenesis. 
Based  on  our  data,  a  primitive  model  was  constructed 
as  shown  in  Fig.  5.
    The  analysis  of  the  whole  genome  expression  data 
using  Ingenuity  Pathway  Analysis  showed  statistically 
significant  gene  alterations,  pertaining  to  different  func-
tional  categories  and  occurring  at  various  time  points 
measured  in  the  knockout  mouse  embryos  (Fig.  6).  As 
shown,  the  deletion  of Gα13  resulted  in  not  only  abnor-
malities  of  cardiovascular  system  but  also  severe  im-
pediments  in  various  other  categories  including  metabol-
ic  pathway,  movement,  cancer,  proliferation,  cell  cycle, 
etc.  The  regulation  of  cancer-related  genes  is  not  sur-
prising  when  we  consider  the  importance  of  the  Gα12/ 
Gα13  family  members  in  cancer  biology  (Spiegelberg 
and  Hamm,  2007).
    Taken  together,  we  present  the  results  that  were  ob-
-/- 
tained  from  the  whole  genome  gene  expression  of Gα13
mouse  embryos  compared  to  wild  type  littermate  em-
bryos,  in  an  attempt  to  ascertain  the  roles  of  Gα13  dur-
ing  embryonic  development.  The  results  presented  here 

170 Genomics  &  Informatics Vol.  9(4)  161-172,  December  2011

throw  light  on  the  possible  mechanisms  of  Gα13  that 
are  involved  in  the  regulation  of  angiogenesis  and  cy-
toskeletal  rearrangements  during  embryonic  develop-
ment.  Moreover,  the  potential  characteristics  of Gα13 
and Gα12  in  causing  neoplasia  (Voyno-Yasenetskaya et 
al.,  1994)  as  well  as  their  roles  in  metastasis  (Spiegel-
berg  and  Hamm,  2007)  cannot  be  ignored,  and  our 
study  further  provides  clues  to  understanding  the  roles 
of  these  enigmatic  proteins  in  cancer  angiogenesis.
