Recent  technical  advances,  such  as  chromatin  immunoprecipitation  combined  with  DNA  microarrays  (ChIp-chip)  and 
chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing (ChIP-seq), have generated large quantities of high-throughput data. Considering 
that epigenomic datasets are arranged over chromosomes, their analysis must account for spatial or temporal characteristics. 
In that sense, simple clustering or classification methodologies are inadequate for the analysis of multi-track ChIP-chip or 
ChIP-seq data. Approaches that are based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) can integrate dependencies between directly 
adjacent measurements in the genome. Here, we review three HMM-based studies that have contributed to epigenetic 
research, from a computational perspective. We also give a brief tutorial on HMM modelling–targeted at bioinformaticians 
who are new to the field.

Keywords: chromatin states, epigenomics, hidden Markov models, noncoding DNA

Introduction

 Many  researchers  have  shown  that  formal  language 
theory is an appropriate tool in analyzing various biological 
sequences [1, 2]. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is most 
closely related to regular grammars, because an n-gram is a 
subsequence of n items from a given sequence, and language 
models that are built from n-grams are actually (n-1)-order 
Markov models. However, the research of modeling biological 
sequences has usually focused on nucleotide or amino acid 
sequences that encode RNA or interact with proteins [3-12]. 
On the other hand, noncoding DNA regions, which occupy 
approximately 98% of human DNA, have not been considered 
for HMM-based analysis. The reason is partially due to the 
fact  that  a  large  proportion  of  noncoding  DNA  has  been 
believed to have no known biological functions.

However,  recent  technical  advances,  such  as  chromatin 
immunoprecipitation  sequencing  (ChIP-seq),  DNase  I 
hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq), formaldehyde- 

assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) [13, 14], 
and  computational  epigenetics,  have  started  to  convert 
unannotated noncoding DNA into highly annotated functional 
areas  [15,  16].  The  work  is  analogous  to  dissecting  the 
region  that  constitutes  the  noncoding  DNA  and  under-
standing the type of meaning each element contains. For this 
reason,  the  field  of  epigenetics  has  received  a  boost  of 
attention and is currently among the fastest moving areas in 
molecular  biology.  However,  epigenetic  mechanisms  are 
highly  interwoven  in  a  complex  network  of  interactions. 
Disentangling this network is an important goal of epigenetic 
research. Thus, various bioinformatic challenges arise from 
the analysis of epigenetic data, and HMMs have played a 
significant role in solving important epigenetic problems, as 
HMMs are well suited to the task of discovering unobserved 
‘hidden’  states  from  ‘observed’  sequences  in  their  spatial 
genomic context.

In this paper, we give a tutorial review of the design of 
HMMs and their applications to solve various computational 
epigenetic problems. We selected three representative works

to compare different designs of HMMs for various compu-
tational epigenetic problems: the Li et al. [17] two-hidden- 
state HMM to determine transcription factor binding sites, 
the  Xu  et  al.  [18]  three-hidden-state  HMM  to  compare 
histone  modification  sites,  and  the  Ernst  and  Kellis  [19] 
multi-state multivariate HMM to analyze systematic state 
dynamics of human cells. We want to clarify the fact that this 
review is by no means exhaustive and that there exist many 
other types of HMMs for computational epigenetic problems.

HMMs and Their Design Issues

An HMM is a statistical model that can be used to describe 
observable events that depend on hidden factors. An HMM 
consists of two stochastic processes: an invisible process of 
hidden states based on a Markov chain and a visible process 
of observable symbols. A first-order HMM can be defined 
formally as a quintuple (S, , , a, e), where S = {1, 2, . . . 
,  n} is a  finite  set of  hidden  states;   is vector of  size  n 
defining the starting probability distribution;  = 1, 2, . . . 
, m is a finite set of output symbols; aij is a two-dimensional 
matrix of transition probabilities of moving from state i to 
state j; and ei(x) is an n × m matrix of emission probabilities 
of  generating  symbol  x  in  state  i.  The  key  property  of  a 
Markov  chain  is  that  the  probability  of  each  symbol  xi 
depends only on the value of the preceding symbol xi−1 [i.e., 
P(xi |xi−1)], not on the entire previous sequence [i.e., P(xi |xi
−1, . . . , x1)].

Fig. 1. A sample sequence, divided in 10-bp bins, annotated with
two  hidden  states:  M  and  U.

In  the  bioinformatics  context,  a  nucleic  one  for  genes, 
genomes, amino acids, or RNA is a sequence. And sequences 
can represent functional regions in the genome. Whereas 
previous  studies  of  coding  DNAs  and  promoters  usually 
modeled  their  HMMs  using  nucleotide  or  amino  acid 
sequences as their output symbols, recent HMM studies that 
are related to epigenomics tend to model their HMMs using 
chromatin marks in bins of equal length as output symbols, 
replacing the traditional nucleotide or amino acid sequences. 
To explain the difference, let us consider a simple exa-
mple. Suppose that adjacent regions of genomic sequences 
are divided into multiple 10-bp bins (though unrealistic), as 
in  Fig.  1,  in  which  some  kinds  of  chromatin  marks  or 
methylation profiles are annotated. Suppose also that we 
define two imaginary methylated states, ‘M’ (in green color) 
and ‘U’ (in orange color), based on some kinds of epigenetic 
profiles.

Let  us  consider  a  toy  HMM  for  Fig.  1.  Given  random 
training data, we try to determine five parameters of the 
HMM. An HMM is usually visualized as a directed graph 
with  vertices  corresponding  to  the  states  and  the  edges 
representing pairs of states with transition probability aij and 
emission probability ei(j), as in Fig. 2. The graph defines the 
topology of the model, while the emission and the transition 
probabilities define the parameters of the model. The given 
HMM tries to capture the statistical differences in the two 
hidden  states  of  ‘M’  and  ‘U.’  The  transition  probability 
represents  the  change  of  the  methylation  state  in  the 
underlying Markov chain. According to Fig. 2A, there is a 
20% chance of moving from state ‘M’ to state ‘U’ (aMU), an 
80% chance of staying in state ‘M’ (aMM), a 10% chance of 
moving from state ‘U’ to state ‘M’ (aUM), and a 90% chance 
of staying in ‘U’ (aUU). The probability of starting from M and 
U is 60% and 40%, respectively. M and U use different sets of 
emission  probabilities  to  reflect  the  symbol  statistics.  In 
epigenetic studies, emission symbols are not nucleotide or 
amino acid sequences. Rather, emission symbols are usually 
defined as a value or even a vector of chromatin marks.

Fig. 2A is an ergodic HMM. An ergodic HMM is one for 
which the underlying Markov chain is irreducible and admits 
a unique stationary distribution. In contrast, a left-to-right

version of an instantiated HMM in Fig. 2B is an HMM with a 
Markov chain that starts in a particular initial state, traverses 
intermediate  states,  and  terminates  in  a  final  state.  Each 
circle shape represents a hidden state. The random variable 
xt is the hidden state at time t. The variables ‘M’ and ‘U’ are 
the observations at time t (with St ∈ {M, U}). The arrows in 
the  diagram  denote  conditional  dependencies.  Unlike  an 
ergodic  HMM,  the  chain  may  not  go  backwards  while 
traversing the trellis.

Different HMM Designs for Identifying DNA 
Methylation Patterns

Genome-wide mapping of epigenetic information follows 
a basic three-stage design process [13]: conversion of the 
epigenetic information into genetic information, application 
of standard DNA techniques, and computational analysis to 
infer the epigenetic information. All experimental methods 
for epigenomic annotation generate large amounts of data 
and  require  efficient  ways  of  processing  the  data.  In  the 
remainder  of  this  review,  we  show  how  HMMs  have 
contributed to answering important epigenetic questions by 
summarizing  HMM-based  bioinformatic  works,  from  a 
computational perspective. Table 1 summarizes the HMM 
parameters of the three studies that will be reviewed in this 
paper, in the order of the hidden state complexity.

Two-State HMMs to Differentiate Non-Enriched 
Genomic Regions from Enriched Ones

Li  et  al.  [17]  developed  a  method  to  determine  tra-
nscription  factor  binding  sites  from  chromatin  immun-
oprecipitation combined with DNA microarrays (ChIP-chip) 
experiments on an Affymetrix tiling array of chromosomes 
21 and 22. Owing to the Affymetrix array characteristics and 
genome sequence similarity, probes with the same 25-mer 
sequence tend to be spotted at different locations on the 
chips.  Two-stage  procedures  were  employed  to  filter  out 
short-range  repetitive  probe  measurements  prior  to 
downstream analysis. Then, tiling array data from various 
experiments  were  gathered  to  normalize  and  model  the 
behavior  of  each  individual  probe,  where  the  behavior  of 
each probe was modeled as a normal distribution. Finally, a 
two-hidden-state  (ChIP-enriched  state  and  nonenriched 
state)  HMM  was  built  to  estimate  the  probability  of 
enrichment at each probe location. 

Given  J  potential  binding  sites  along  chromosomes 
covered  by  K  total  probes,  the  initial  probabilities  and 
transition probabilities of HMM were characterized, as in 
Fig.  3.  Initial  probabilities  were  set  to  J/K  for  the  ChIP- 
enriched state and to 1 − J/K for the nonenriched state. 
Transition probabilities were set to J/K for transition to a 
different state and 1 − J/K for staying in the same state. The

emission probability distribution of probe in a single dataset 
was set to N(μi + 2σi, (1.5σi)2) for the ChIP-enriched state 
2) for the nonenriched state (where μi and σi 
and N(μi, σi
are the mean and standard deviation, respectively, of probe 
i). The parameters were based on previous results with the 
Affymetrix SNP arrays [20].

Other methods that are based on two-state HMMs for the 
identification of methylated regions were proposed [22-25]. 
A common characteristic of these studies is the modeling of 
two different populations of measurements to differentiate 
nonenriched regions from enriched ones. Ji and Wong [22] 
suggested TileMap, which is an effective statistical tool to 
identify genomic loci that show transcriptional or protein 
binding  patterns  of  interest.  Martin-Magniette  et  al.  [23] 
proposed ChIP-mix, which is a statistical method based on 
the  mixture  of  regression  to  classify  probes  in  ChIP-chip 
experiments.  Johannes  et  al.  [24]  presented  a  parametric 
classification  method  for  genomewide  comparisons  of 
chromatin  profiles  between  multiple  ChIP  samples.  In 
Moghaddam  et  al.  [25],  they  showed  that  H3K4me2  and 
H3K27me3  distribution  patterns  were  similar  overall  in 
various  Arabidopsis  thaliana  accessions  and  remained 
largely unchanged in their F1 progeny [25].

Three-State HMMs for ChIP Analysis

One  general limitation of the methods in the previous 
section is that they only enable binary classification. For this 
reason,  a  three-state  HMM  has  been  proposed  for  the 
analysis of so-called differential histone modification sites 
(DHMSs) of H3K27me3 by Xu et al. [18]. To capture the 
histone modifications on the whole-genome scale, Xu et al. 
[18] proposed a qualitative analysis for the genome-wide 
comparison of histone modification sites by computationally 
comparing two ChIP-seq libraries generated from different 
cell types or experimental conditions. To do that, the whole 
genome was partitioned into 1-kb bins, and the number of 
centers of ChIP fragments was counted and normalized in 
each bin, generating a profile of ChIP fragment counts. 

Fig.  4.  A  three-state  hidden  Markov  model  (HMM)  [18].

Based on the observations of ChIP fragment counts, Fig. 4 
shows an HMM to infer the states of histone modification 
changes at each genomic location. The HMM is characterized 
by three features: the prior probability of the start state, the 
emission  probability,  and  the  transmission  probability.  A 
DHMS was defined as a bin in which the ratio of intensities 
between two profiles (L1 and L2) is larger than τ (L1-enriched 
DHMSs) or smaller than 1/τ (L2-enriched DHMSs), where 
τ is a predetermined threshold [19]. Based on the definition 
of a DHMS, the state Si takes one of the following three 
values: α0 if 1/τ ≤ p(1,i)/p(2,i) ≤ τ; α1 if p(1,i)/p(2,i) ＞ τ; 
and α2 if p(1,i)/p(2,i) ＜ 1/τ. (For a region of k bins, the 
notation x1,i, x2,i was used for the ChIP fragment counts in L1 
and L2, and the notation p1,i, p2,i was used for the intensity in 
L1 and L2, respectively, at the ith bin in that region.) The 
initial state is fixed to take the value of α0, since the region 
is assumed to start from the genomic locations where the 
histone  modification  is  depleted  in  both  libraries.  The 
emission probability P(x1,i, x2,i |si) was calculated as in Fig. 4 
by integrating p1,i and p2,i over all possible values constrained 
by si. The transmission probability table was trained using 
the Baum-Welch algorithm [21]. 

Other methods of three-state HMMs for the identification 
of methylated regions have been proposed. Seifert et al. [26] 
also proposed a three-state HMM specifically designed for 
the analysis of Arabidopsis MeDIP-chip data to differentiate 
between unmethylated (‘U’), methylated (‘M’), and highly 
methylated regions (‘I’). They utilized a three- state HMM 
with state-specific multivariate Gaussian emission densities 
to  analyze  methylation  levels  of  chromosomal  regions  in 
methylation profiles. Arand et al. [27] suggested a four-state 
HMM  (fully  methylated,  not  methylated  on  both  sides, 

148

methylated only on the lower strand, and methylated only on 
the upper strand) to determine the methylation status of 
both DNA strands.

Multiple-State  and  Multivariate  HMMs  for 
Analyzing Systematic State Dynamics of 
Human Cells

High-dimensional multivariate datasets occur in a large 
number of problem domains. In many cases, these datasets 
have either a sequential or temporal structure. To uncover 
which combinations of histone modifications are biologically 
meaningful, Ernst and Kellis [19] took a drastically different 
approach from others, particularly in two aspects: automatic 
determination  of  hidden  states  and  usage  of  a  massive 
amount of multivariate data as observed sequences. They 
applied  unsupervised  learning  methodologies,  converting 
the  ChIP-seq  dataset  from  the  Broad  Histone  track  into 
discrete annotation maps of 51 chromatin elements across the 
human genome. Fig. 5 summarizes their approach: genomic 
profiling, binarization, model learning, and annotation.

Fig.  5A  shows  that  the  profiles  are  represented  as  X1 
={x1,1, x1,2, ..., x1,m}, where xi,j is the fragment count at the jth 
bin in Li and m is the number of bins. As input, it receives a 
list  of  aligned  reads  for  each  chromatin  mark,  which  are 
automatically converted into presence or absence calls for 
each mark across the genome. Fig. 5B shows that the profile 
data were binarized separately at 200-base-pair resolution, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  12,  No.  4,  2014

based on a Poisson background model. The chromatin states 
were learned from the binarized data using a multivariate 
HMM.  Fig.  5C  shows  a  two-stage  nested  initialization 
procedure of hidden states. Ernst and Kellis [19] used an 
iterative  learning  expectation-maximization  approach  to 
infer state emission and transition parameters, with the best 
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Fig. 5D shows that 
each 200-base-pair interval was then assigned to its most 
likely state under the model. The model assumes a fixed 
number of 51 distinct hidden states, including promoter- 
associated, transcription-associated, active intergenic, large- 
scale repressed, and repeat-associated states. 

Originally, Jaschek and Tanay [28] discussed the necessity 
of  automatic determination  of  hidden states  in  designing 
HMMs. Ernst et al. [29] later proposed a more stable 15-state 
model that showed distinct biological enrichments [19].

Conclusion

In this paper, we reviewed three different types of HMMs 
and  their  applications  in  order  of  the  complexity  of  the 
hidden  states,  from  a  purely  computational  perspective. 
HMMs  provide  a  sound  mathematical  framework  for 
modeling  and  analyzing  epigenetic  data.  The  appropriate 
method for the analysis of DNA methylation depends upon 
the  goals  of  the  study.  Researchers  can  design  the  most 
appropriate  HMMs  for  their  specific  research  needs  and 
continued  improvements  in  analysis  methods  make  the
