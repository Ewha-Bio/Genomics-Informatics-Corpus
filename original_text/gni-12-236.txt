The genetic regulation of glucose and insulin levels might be modified by adiposity. With regard to the genetic factors that 
are altered by adiposity, a large meta-analysis on the interactions between genetic variants and body mass index with regard 
to fasting glucose and insulin levels was reported by the Meta-Analyses of Glucose- and Insulin-related trait Consortium 
(MAGIC), based on European ancestry. Because no replication study has been performed in other ethnic groups, we first 
examined the link between reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and fasting glucose and insulin levels in a large 
Korean cohort (Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study cohort [KoGES], n = 5,814). The MAGIC study reported 7 novel SNPs 
for fasting glucose levels and 6 novel SNPs for fasting insulin levels. In this study, we attempted to replicate the association 
of 5 SNPs with fasting glucose levels and 5 SNPs with fasting insulin levels. One SNP (rs2293941) in PDX1 was identified as 
a significant obesity-modifiable factor in Koreans. Our results indicate that the novel loci that were identified by MAGIC are 
poorly replicated in other ethnic groups, although we do not know why.

Introduction

The  rapid  socioeconomic  developments  in  developing 
countries have led to a shift in infrastructure, technology, 
and  food  supply,  promoting  overnutrition  and  sedentary 
lifestyles  [1].  Consequently,  the  prevalence  of  metabolic 
diseases,  such  as  obesity  and  type  2  diabetes,  has  risen 
dramatically  [2,  3].  In  particular,  Asian  countries  have 
experienced a notable increase in metabolic disease; thus, 
prevention and control of metabolic diseases should be the 
top public health priorities in Asian populations [3].

Glucose  and  insulin  levels  after  overnight  fasting  are 
important indicators of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, 
and type 2 diabetes [4]. Adiposity is believed modulate the 
genetic determinants of fasting glucose and insulin levels 
[5]. To identify genetic determinants that could be modified 
by  body  mass  index  (BMI),  the  interactions  between 
genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 

BMI with regard to fasting glucose and insulin levels were 
analyzed  by  the  Meta-Analyses  of  Glucose-  and  Insulin- 
related traits Consortium (MAGIC) [6]. MAGIC identified 
several  novel  genetic  variants:  7  SNPs  (ARAP1,  FOXA2, 
DPYSL5, PCSK1, PDX1, PPP1R3B, and OR4S1) for fasting 
glucose level and 6 SNPs (COBLL1-GRB14, IRS1, PPP1R3B, 
PDGFC, UHRF1BP1, and LYPLAL1) for fasting insulin level 
[6].  The  MAGIC  study  comprised  approximately  70,000 
nondiabetic individuals of European ancestry, and its results 
should be confirmed in other ethnic groups [7].

Because no replication study has been performed in other 
ethnicities, we examined these SNPs and their association 
with  fasting  glucose  and  insulin  levels  and  determined 
whether  they  are  modified  by  obesity  in  the  Korean 
population. The study design can be found in Fig. 1.

Methods
Study subjects and genotypes

The  subjects  and  their  genotypes  in  the  original  study 
have been reported [7]. The initial subjects were obtained 
from  a  subset  of  the  Korean  Genome  and  Epidemiology 
Study cohort (KoGES), known as Korean Association Re-
source (KARE, n = 8,842) [7]. Written informed consent 
was  obtained  from  all  participants,  and  this  project  was 
approved by the institutional review board at Korea National 
Institute of Health (KNIH).

ments, including weight and height, were also obtained, and 
BMI  was  calculated  as  weight  (kg)/height  (m2)  [2].  Bio-
chemical  assessments  were  performed,  including  fasting 
serum  glucose,  2-h  75  g  oral  glucose  tolerance  test,  and 
fasting serum insulin (FSI). A total of 3,028 subjects with 
prevalent hyperglycemia (fasting glucose ≥ 110, 2-h glucose 
level  after  75  g  oral  glucose  challenge  ≥  140),  or 
self-reported diabetes history were excluded. Of the 8,842 
individuals  who  were  examined  in  the  previous  genome- 
wide association study [7],  5,814  nondiabetic  individuals 
were selected.

Phenotypes and quantitative traits

SNP genotypes

Past  diabetes  history  was  obtained  through  structured 
questionnaires by interviewers. Anthropometric measure-

Resource  consortium.

The  genotypes  were  obtained  using  the  Affymetrix 
Genome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc., Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). The genotype quality control criteria have 
been reported in a previous genome-wide association study 
[7]. Briefly, every 500 ng of genomic DNA was genotyped on 
the  Affy  5.0,  and  the  Bayesian  robust  linear  genotyping 
algorithm  using  Mahalanobis  distance  was  used  for 
genotype calling [8]. Samples with a high missing genotype 
call rate (≥4%), high heterozygosity (＞30%), inconsisten-
cy in sex, and any tumor were excluded from subsequent 
analyses.

Genotype imputation

Of the 13 SNPs that were reported by the MAGIC con-
sortium,  4  SNPs  were  genotyped  in  the  original  KARE 
genotype data using the Affy 5.0. To maximize the validation 
SNPs in Koreans, the Chinese-Japanese HapMap dataset was 
imputed to obtain 6 additional SNPs. Thus, 10 SNPs were 
analyzed in this study. The detailed imputation procedure 
has been published. Briefly, the KARE dataset, comprising 
351,677 SNPs in 8,842 individuals, was merged with that of 
the international HapMap Phase II Japanese (JPT) + Chinese 
(HCB) panel 2 [9]. The genotypes of the KARE individuals 
were  imputed  using  IMPUTE  [10].  Using  the  following 
filtering scheme—INFO ≥ 0.5 and posterior probability ≥

KW  Hong,  et  al.  SNP-BMI  Interactions  and  Glucose  and  Insulin  Levels

0.9−1,827,004  SNPs  were  imputed,  and  6  SNPs  that 
matched among the 13 SNPs that were reported by MAGIC 
were selected for study.

Statistical analysis

quicktest.shtml),  and  the  dichotomized  BMI-SNP  inter-
actions were analyzed using PLINK, version 1.07 [11]. 

Results and Discussion

Glucose and insulin levels were natural log-transformed. 
To examine the effects of SNP-BMI interactions on them, we 
conducted 4 statistical tests for each SNP. In all analyses, 
residential area, age, sex, and BMI were the covariates. The 
first 2 tests were linear regression analyses of lean (BMI ＜ 
25)  and  overweight  subjects  (BMI  ≥ 25).  The  overall 
interactions  between  SNPs  and  BMI  were  analyzed  using 
continuous BMI values and dichotomized BMI (lean subjects 
were coded with 1, and overweight subjects were coded with 
2). Continuous BMI-SNP interaction analyses were perform-
ed using QUICKTEST (http://toby.freeshell.org/software/ 

The  fasting  serum  glucose  and  insulin  levels  of  our 
subjects are shown in Table 1. We divided subjects into 4 
groups, based on BMI; most Korean subjects lay in the 20 ≤ 
BMI ＜ 25 and 25 ≤ BMI ＜ 30 categories. The MAGIC study 
had BMI cutoffs of ＜ 25 and ≥ 30, and 237 of our subjects 
(4%)  had  BMI  ≥ 30.  Asians  have  lower  rates  of  over-
weightedness  and  obesity  than  Western  populations,  per 
conventional definitions (BMI ≥ 25 for overweightedness 
and ≥ 30 for obesity) [3]. Despite having lower BMIs, Asian 
countries have a similar or greater prevalence of diabetes 
versus Western countries [12]. Thus, we used BMI ＜ 25 and

BMI ≥ 25 to analyze the effects of SNPs and SNP-dichoto-
mized BMI interactions by stratum.

Of the 6 SNPs that were associated with FSI levels in the 
MAGIC studies, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, 
and no SNP was replicated in all 3 statistical tests (stratified 
BMI,  continuous  BMI  interaction  p-values,  and  dichoto-
mized  BMI  interaction  p-values)  (see  Table  2).  Of  the  7 
reported SNPs that were linked to fasting plasma glucose 
levels, 5 SNPs could be tested in the current study, and 1 SNP 
(rs2293941)  in  pancreatic  and  duodenal  homeobox  1 
(PDX1) was significantly associated in lean subjects (beta ± 
SE,  0.007  ±  0.002;  p  =  0.001)  but  not  in  overweight 
subjects.  The  SNP-continuous  BMI  interaction  was  not 
significant, but the SNP-dichotomized BMI interaction was 
marginal (p = 0.04).

Our results indicate that the novel loci that were identified 
by  MAGIC  are  poorly  replicated  in  other  ethnic  groups, 
although  we  do  not  know  why.  We  have  identified  an 
important  genetic  factor  of  glucose  metabolism,  PDX1, 
which regulates pancreatic beta-cell function and survival by 
governing expression of the insulin-encoding INS gene [13]. 
This study was limited by its exclusion of 3 other SNP-BMI 
interactions  from  MAGIC.  These  SNPs  could  not  be  ex-
tracted from the imputation data using the original Affy 5.0 
in the KARE study. Another limitation of this study was the 
relatively weak significance of its association results com-
pared with those of MAGIC. We do not know whether this 
lack of significance is due to the relatively smaller sample 
size of this study compared with MAGIC, the inaccuracy of 
imputation genotypes, or ethnic differences in the SNP-BMI 
interactions.  These  issues  should  be  addressed  in  other 
Asian populations.

Although  the  replication  of  gene-environment  interac-
tions  in  other  ethnic  groups  is  difficult,  interethnic  con-
servation of the interaction results might help us determine 
the  underlying  mechanisms  of  the  target  phenotypes. 
Further,  the  rs2293941  SNP  might  help  us  understand 
individual differences in beta-cell function.
