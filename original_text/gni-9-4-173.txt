Abstract

Recent  trends  in  generating  multiple,  large-scale  data-
sets  provide  new  challenges  to  manipulating  the  rela-
tionship  of  different  types  of  components,  such  as  gene 
expression  and  drug  response  data.  Integrative  analysis 
of  compound  response  and  gene  expression  datasets 
generates  an  opportunity  to  capture  the  possible  mech-
anism  of  compounds  by  using  signature  genes  on  di-
verse  types  of  cancer  cell  lines.  Here,  we  integrated  da-
tasets  of  compound  response  and  gene  expression  pro-
files  on  NCI60  cell  lines  and  constructed  a  network,  re-
vealing  the  relationship  for  801  compounds  and  341 
gene  probes.  As  examples,  obtusol,  which  shows  an  ex-
clusive  sensitivity  on  a  small  number  of  colon  cell  lines, 
is  related  to  a  set  of  gene  probes  that  have  unique 
overexpression  in  colon  cell  lines.  We  also  found  that 
the  SLC7A11  gene,  a  direct  target  of  miR-26b,  might  be 
a  key  element  in  understanding  the  action  of  many  di-
verse  classes  of  anticancer  compounds.  We  demon-
strated  that  this  network  might  be  useful  for  studying 
the  mechanisms  of  varied  compound  response  on  di-
verse  cancer  cell  lines.

Introduction

The  interest  in  studying  mechanisms  of  compounds  and 
finding  new  compounds  with  better  efficacy  than  known 
anticancer  drugs  has  recently  increased  due  to  the  de-
creasing  number  and  increasing  cost  of  newly  released 
anticancer  drugs  (Xu  and  Cote,  2011).  NCI60  project  as 
a  predictive  model  of  drug  response  and  gene  expres-
sion  was  developed  by  the  US  National  Cancer  Institute 
(NCI)  (Shoemaker,  2006).  This  panel  of  60  cell  lines  in-
cludes  nine  distinct  tumor  types:  leukemia  (LN),  colon

available  (http://dtp.cancer.gov/).  The  cell  line  response 
to  the  compounds  is  quantified  by  GI50  value，the  con-
centration  required  to  inhibit  the  growth  of  an  exposed 
cell  line  culture  to  50%  relative  to  the  untreated  control.
    Recently,  the  construction  of  biophysical  network 
models  of  numerous  components  has  contributed  to  our 
understanding  of  the  relationship  between  different  ty-
pes  of  biological  responses  (Pe'er  and  Hacohen,  2011). 
A  critical  question  remaining  is  how  to  interpret  the  net-
work  and  take  out  the  new  biological  insights  or  know-
ledge.  Our  approach  to  this  question  is  to  calculate  the 
simple  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  (PCC)  (Liu  et al., 
2007)  (Jobson et al.,  2007)  of  drug  response  and  gene 
expression  profile  over  diverse  NCI60  cell  lines.  It  is 
possible  to  obtain  a  certain  number  of  significant  corre-
lations  between  gene  expression  and  compound  re-
sponse  on  subsets  of  cancer  samples.  In  this  research, 
our  goal  is  to  create  a  global  network  including  all 
known  compound  data  and  gene  expression  profiles, 
and  to  subtract  specific  networks  of  genes  and  com-
pounds  revealing  unique  mechanisms  of  compound 
action.

Methods

Acquisition  and  filtration  of  compound  response 
data

Data  of  compound  response  (GI50)  on  NCI60  cell  lines 
was  downloaded  from  the  NCI  Developmental  Ther-
apeutics  Program  (DTP)  site  (www.//dtp.nci.nih.gov).  The 
GI50  data  released  in  August  2004  was  used  in  this 
study.  They  provided  more  than  40,000  compounds  with 
a  GI50  value  to  characterize  compound  sensitivity  to  di-
verse  NCI60  cancer  cell  lines.  GI50  is  defined  as  the 
concentration  of  a  compound  required  to  inhibit  cell 
growth  by  50%  after  exposed  to  the  compound  for  48 
hours  in  comparison  with  untreated  cells.  GI50  values 
were  further  transformed  to  －logGI50  to  linearly  profile 
the  compounds’  sensitivity.  The  2D  structures  and  che-
mical  names  of  compounds  were  also  obtained  through 
the  DTP  website  of  NCI.
    Compound  data  were  further  filtered  based  upon  sev-
eral  criteria;  the  number  of  missing  data  on  60  cell  lines 
＜5,  the  standard  deviation  (SD)  of  compound  response 
＞0.1,  and  －logGI50＞5  in  at  least  one  cell  line.  In  or-
der  to  remove  compounds  with  many  missing  data  (eg, 
GI50  value),  we  chose  compounds  with  missing  data  on 
only  less  than  5  cell  lines.  We  also  selected  compounds 
with  relatively  varied  response  on  diverse  cell  lines  by 
removing  compounds  with  consistent  response  on  all  60 
cell  lines  (ie,  SD＜0.1)  (Deeken  et al.,  2009).  Further-
more,  compounds  with  no  significant  potency  in  any  cell 

lines  were  removed.  Thus,  we  selected  compounds  with 
－logGI50＞5  (i.e.,  GI50＜10μM)  on  at  least  one  cell 
line.

Analysis  of  DNA  microarray  data

NCI60  gene  expression  data  was  also  downloaded  from 
the  DTP  website.  NCI60  gene  expression  data  gen-
erated  using  Affymetrix  u133A/B  microarrays  and  proc-
essed  using  the  MAS5  normalization  algorithm  (Zhou 
and  Rocke,  2005).  Data  for  a  total  of  44,928  gene  pro-
bes  screened  on  59  cell  lines  (data  missing  on  NCI-H23 
cell  line)  were  retrieved.  Gene  probes  with  a  standard 
deviation  of  ＞2  across  all  59  cell  lines  and  a  fold- 
change  of  ＞4  over  the  median  value  on  at  least  one 
cell  line  were  selected  for  the  further  analysis.

Constructing  network  and  data  visualization

Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  (PCC)  and  its  p-value 
between  compounds  and  genes  were  calculated  using 
drug  response  and  gene  expression  data  on  59  NCI60 
cell  lines.  The  criteria  of  PCC＞0.7  and  p-value＜0.01 
were  applied  to  select  compound-gene  relationship  for 
further  analysis.  Finally,  the  network  was  constructed  for 
links  between  compounds  and  genes  using  Cytoscape 
(http://www.cytoscape.org/)  (Merico  et al.,  2009).  The 
force-layout  algorithm  was  applied  to  optimize  the  top-
ology  of  network  (Garcia  et al.,  2007).
    The  2D  structures  and  annotation  of  compounds  were 
displayed  by  MarvinSketch  developed  by  ChemAxon 
(http://www.chemaxon.com/).  The  structural  similarity 
among  compounds  was  calculated  by  Pipeline  Pilot 
(Chu  et al.,  2009).  Hierarchical  clustering  of  compound 
and  gene  expression  data  was  carried  out  using  com-
plete  linkage  algorithm  (Williams et al.,  1976)  (http://bon-
sai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/).  Tree  Viewer  was 
used  to  visualize  the  clustered  data  (http://www.treeview. 
net).  All  figures  were  edited  using  Adobe  Illustrator  CS3 
(http://www.adobe.com).

Results  and  Discussion

Clustering  analysis  of  compound  response  data 

Among  48,151  compounds,  a  total  of  6,652  compounds 
satisfied  the  filtration  criteria  (see  methods  section  for 
details).  They  showed  a  significant  response  (－logGI50
＜5)  on  at  least  one  cell  lines  and  demonstrated  varied 
response  on  60  cell  lines  with  missing  data  on  less  than 
5  cell  lines.  We  carried  out  a  clustering  analysis  of  GI50 
data  for  these  6,652  compounds  over  60  cell  lines  (Fig. 
1A).  Three  major  patterns  were  observed  in  the  com-

pound  classification:  sensitive  or  resistant  responses  on 
most  cell  lines,  and  some  compounds  exhibiting  both 
sensitive  and  resistant  responses  in  a  cell  line-depend-
ent  manner.  Many  of  them  showed  a  difference  of  over 
＞100-fold  in  GI50  values  among  cell  lines,  which  im-
plied  a  cell  line-specific  mechanism  of  the  drug  action. 
For  example,  compounds  in  the  bottom  area  of  the  heat-
map  in  Fig.  1A  showed  resistant  response  (－logGI50=
∼－4)  on  most  cell  lines  (green  colors),  while  a  few  cell 
lines  gave  -logGI50＞5  (red  colors). 
    A  total  of  9  different  lineage  groups  are  represented 
by  NCI60  cell  lines.  Leukemia  cell  lines  tended  to  have 
relatively  sensitive  response  to  the  majority  of  cell  lines, 
although  they  were  clustered  in  two  separate  groups. 
They  were  clustered  together  with  some  lung  cell  lines. 
All  of  CNS  cell  lines  were  clustered  together  in  a  large 
group,  and  they  were  resistant  to  more  numbers  of 

Signatures  for  Compound  Response 175

compounds  than  other  lineage  groups.  Melanoma  groups 
were  shown  to  distribute  in  separate  clusters  from  CNS 
cell  lines.  Overall,  cell  lines  did  not  show  lineage-  spe-
cific  clustering  patterns  of  drug  responses;  however,  we 
could  find  some  unique  clustering  patterns  in  lineage 
groups，such  as  Leukemia,  CNS  and  Melanoma  cells. 
Among  6,652  compounds  with  varied  responses  on 
NCI60  cell  lines,  we  further  selected  801  compounds 
that  exhibited  a  significant  correlation  with  gene  probes 
in  the  DNA  microarray  data  on  NCI60  cell  lines  (Fig.  1B). 
Their  GI50  profile  showed  positive  or  negative  correla-
tions  with  the  expression  profile  of  at  least  one  gene 
probe  in  the  DNA  microarray  data.  We  focused  on  these 
compounds  for  the  network-based  analysis  of  com-
pound  and  gene  probe  pairs.

Clustering  analysis  of  gene  expression  data 

In  the  analysis  of  gene  expression  profile  from  DNA  mi-
croarray  data,  lineage-oriented  clustering  patterns  were 
more  obvious  than  in  the  compound  response  profile 
(Fig.  2).  We  used  a  total  of  5,635  filtered  gene  probes 
for  this  analysis  (See  Methods  section  for  details  of  fil-
tration).  Among  the  9  different  lineages  of  NCI60  cell 
lines,  Leukemia,  CNS  and  colon  cell  lines  were  com-
pletely  clustered  together  on  a  lineage  basis  (Fig.  2A). 
Melanoma  and  Renal  groups  were  also  well-clustered 
with  only  one  exception.  Most  lung  cell  lines  were  in-
cluded  in  a  single  cluster.  This  observation  was  roughly 
consistent  with  clustering  patterns  in  the  compound 
response.  Relatively  homogeneous  characteristics  in  cell 
lines  within  a  lineage  group  (leukemia,  CNS  and  melano-
ma)  were  observed  through  gene  expression  analysis, 
which  explains  the  similar  compound  responses  among 
cell  lines  of  common  lineages.  However,  cell  lines  of 
breast  and  ovary  did  not  show  a  lineage-oriented  clus-
tering  pattern,  indicating  that  they  are  more  heteroge-
neous  than  those  in  other  lineage  groups.  Thus,  the 
analysis  of  compound  responses  on  these  lineages  re-
quire  furthers  sub-clustering  of  cell  lines  to  find  im-
proved  correlations  between  compound  response  and 
gene  expression  profiles.
    We  could  also  identify  unique  gene  signatures  for 
several  lineage  groups.  A  large  number  of  up-regulated 
gene  signatures  were  observed  in  melanoma  cell  lines. 
In  the  cases  of  leukemia  and  colon  cell  lines,  significant 
gene  signatures  were  found  with  both  up-  and  down- 
regulated  patterns.  CNS  also  exhibited  a  small  line-
age-specific  gene  signature,  while  renal  cell  lines  did  not 
show  any  signature  groups  with  a  significant  expression 
pattern.  Among  these  5,635  gene  probes,  we  further  se-
lected  341  gene  probes  with  a  significant  correlation 
with  the  GI50  profile  of  a  compound  in  Fig.  1  (Fig.  2B). 
They  were  used  for  the  following  network-based  ana-
lysis.
    In  conclusion,  gene  expression  profiles  reveal  lineage- 
specific  clustering  patterns,  indicating  that  gene  sig-
natures  effectively  represent  the  distinct  biological  fea-
tures  in  the  lineage-based  analysis  of  cell  lines.  In  the 
other  hand,  the  compound  response  data  shows  rela-
tively  complicated  patterns  in  the  lineage  clustering,  in-
dicating  that  the  compound  response  is  the  outcome  of 
complicated  mechanisms  beyond  lineage-specific  fea-
tures.  Thus,  combining  the  GI50  with  gene  expression 
data  on  NCI60  panel  might  provide  a  new  tool  for  un-
derstanding  lineage-specific  versus  non-lineage-specific 
mechanisms  in  drug  action.

Network  analysis  of  the  relationship  between 
compound  response  and  gene  expression

A  large-scale  correlation  study  between  compound  re-
sponse  and  gene  expression  was  carried  out  using 
NCI60  cell  lines.  The  relationship  was  analyzed  on  a 
network  which  represents  similarity  of  GI50s  of  a  com-
pound  and  fold  change  of  a  gene  probe  over  59  cell 
lines  (Fig.  3).  Totals  of  801  compounds  and  341  gene 
probes  had  at  least  one  counterpart  with  a  significantly 
high  correlation  (PCC＞0.7  &  p-value＜0.01).  Most  of 
the  selected  gene  probes  had  more  than  one  connected 
compound  that  mediated  inter-connection  among  gene 
probes,  resulting  in  a  globular  shape  in  the  overall  net-
work  topology.  However,  a  small  number  of  compounds 
and  gene  probes  showed  an  isolated  network  containing 
only  one  or  a  few  number  of  compound-gene  probe 
pairs.  The  data  provide  a  useful  resource  for  studying 
and  predicting  the  mechanism  of  drug  actions  on  di-
verse  cancer  cells.
    To  further  explore  this  network,  we  picked  up  two 
sub-networks  to  examine  the  correlations  between  the 
involved  components.  Firstly,  as  shown  in  the  Fig.  4, 
compound  of  NSC710203  (Obtusol)  shows  a  close  rela-
tionship  with  207463_x_at,  204818_at,  and  3421_x_at. 
Obtusol  is  known  to  have  an  anti-bacterial  activity  (Vai-

Fig.  3.  Correlation  network  of  compounds  and  gene 
probes.  The  correlation  between  compound  response  and 
gene  expression  was  calculated  using  －log(GI50)  and 
log(fold  change)  values  on  NCI60  cell  lines.  Totals  of  801 
compounds  and  341  genes  were  selected  with  a  significant 
correlation  (p＜0.01)  displayed  with  connecting  edges.

Signatures  for  Compound  Response 177

gene  probes.  Three  probes  for  PRSS3  and  HSD17B2  genes

of  GI50  of  Obtusol  on  NCI60  cell  lines.  (A)  The  structure  of

rappan et al.,  2001;  Vairappan,  2003).  Among  three  re-
lated  gene  probes,  both  207463_x_at,  and  3421_  x_at 
represent  the  PRSS3  gene,  which  can  promotes  tumor 
growth  and  metastasis  of  human  pancreatic  cancer 
(Jiang  et al.,  2010).  Another  gene  probe  204818_at  is 
HSD17B2,  which  can  regulate  intracellular  levels  of 
granulosa  cells  (GCs)  (Svechnikova  et al.,  2007).  These 
two  genes,  PRSS3  and  HSD17B2  are  predicted  as 
Obtusol  related  genes.  Interestingly,  Obtusol  showed  a 
relatively  strong  sensitivity  on  only  a  small  number  of 
colon  cancer  cell  lines,  while  it  had  no  significant  sensi-
tivity  on  all  of  other  cell  lines  (Fig.  4B).  The  related 
genes,  PRSS3  and  HSD17B2,  showed  a  unique  up-reg-
ulation  on  most  of  colon  cell  lines.  It  seems  that  unique 
functions  of  these  genes  in  colon  cancer  cell  lines  might 
be  related  to  the  mechanism  of  action  of  Obtusol. 
However,  in  order  to  explain  the  specificity  of  Obtusol 
on  a  narrow  range  of  colon  cell  lines,  it  requires  further 
sub-classification  of  gene  signatures  within  the  cell  lines 
of  colon  cancers.
    Another  subnetwork  includes  a  gene  probe,  209921_ 
at,  and  a  total  of  39  related  compounds  (Fig.  5). 
209921_at  presents  SLC7A11  (solute  carrier  family  7 
(anionic  amino  acid  transporter  light  chain,  xc-  system), 
member  11),  which  has  been  known  as  a  direct  target 
of  miR-26b.  Its  expression  is  remarkably  increased  in 
both  breast  cancer  cell  lines  and  clinical  samples  (Liu et 
al.,  2011).  MiR-26b  is  a  down-regulated  gene  in  human 
breast  cancer  cell  lines  which  can  impairs  viability  and 
triggers  apoptosis  of  human  MCF7  cells  (Davoren et al., 
2008).  Based  on  2D  chemical  similarity,  27  out  of  39

ionic  amino  acid  transporter  light  chain,  xc-  system),  mem-
ber  11).

compounds  were  clustered  into  6  groups.  The  chemical 
names  of  cluster  centers,  their  biological  (or  chemical) 
information  and  the  number  of  compounds  in each clus-
ter  were  summarized  in  Table  2.  NSC249956  (Chapliatrin) 
is  isolated  from  Liatris  gracills,  which  has  many  anti-tu-
mor  constituents  (Gravuer  et al.,  2003).  NSC34821  (2- 
Propen-1-one,  2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-  1-(2-nitro  phe-
nyl)-,hydrochloride)  is  a  similar  chemical  of  alkylamino-
propiophenone  which  is  known  to  have  a  potent  anti-
neoplastic  activity  (Huang  and  Hall,  1996).  NSC708044 
(2-butenoic  acid,  4,4-dicyano-4-[(phenylmethylene)ami-
no]-,methyl  ester,  (Z,E)-(9CI))  has  an  effect  on  chemo-
resistance,  mediated  by  glutathione  transport  system 
(Dai  et al.,  2007).  NSC654206  (Naphthsaritone)  and  its 
related  compounds  was  used  in  the  treatment  and  con-
trol  of  insulin  resistance  and  hyperglycemia  (Cote  and 
Goodman,  1973).  NSC138333  (Cyclohexanone,  2,6-bis 
(4-(1,3-dihydro-2H-pyrrolo[3,4-b] quinolin-2-ylcarbonyl)-2- 
oxotetrahydro-3-furanyl)methyl  acetate),  one  of  pyrrolo- 
quinoline  derivative,  is  a  potent  inhibitor  for  PI3-kinase 
related  kinases  (Peng et al., 2002).  NSC38533  (Cyclohex-
anone, 2,6-bis(4-morpholinylmethyl)-,dihydrochloride) 
can  be  as  a  potential  drug  for  the  treatment  of  the 
ER-negative  breast  cancer  MDA-MB-231  and  SKBr3  hu-
man  breast  cancer  cells  (Somers-Edgar  et al.,  2011).  It 
is  implied  that  SLC7A11  plays  an  essential  role  in  the 
action  of  these  6  compound  classes.  We  have  demon-
strated  that  the  network-based  analysis  of  compound 
response  and  expression  patterns  is  a  new  promising 
approach  to  categorize  compounds  and  predict  the 
mechanism  of  action.

Compounds  in  Fig.  5  were  classified  into  6  clusters  based  on  chemical  similarity  (Tanimoto  index,＞0.8).  A  total  of  27  out  of  39  compounds 
belong  to  6  clusters.

    In  conclusion,  we  attempted  to  integrate  compound 
and  gene  expression  data  on  diverse  cancer  cell  lines. 
It  enabled  us  to  find  many  unexpected  relationships  be-
tween  genes  and  compounds.  Previously,  most  of  anal-
ysis  have  focused  on  finding  gene  signatures  (Ballif  et 
al.,  2011)  or  compounds  clusters  (Takigawa et al.,  2011), 
and  there  are  few  reports  on  the  cross  analysis  of  com-
pound  and  gene  expression  data  on  diverse  cell  types. 
In  the  present  study,  we  built  a  network  of  compound- 
gene  relationships  on  59  diverse  cell  lines  retrieved  from 
NCI60  datasets.  Patterns  in  subnetworks  provided  new 
clues  on  the  possible  mechanisms  of  compounds.
