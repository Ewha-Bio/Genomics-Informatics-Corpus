Abstract

The  use  of  genomic  information  in  genomic  selection 
programs  for  dairy  and  beef  cattle  breeds  has  become 
a  reality  in  recent  years.  In  this  investigation,  we  ana-
lyzed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for Hanwoo 
(n=50)  and  Holstein  (n=50)  breeds  using  the  Illumina 
Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  to  facilitate  genomic  selection 
and  utilization  of  the  Hanwoo  breed  in  Korea.  Analysis 
of  the  entire  genomes  showed  different  spectra  of  SNP 
frequencies  for  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  cattle.  The  study 
revealed  a  highly  significant  (p＜0.001)  difference  be-
tween  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  cattle  in  minor  allele  fre-
quency  (MAF).  The  average  MAFs  were  0.19±0.16  and 
0.22±0.16  for  Hanwoo  and  Holstein,  respectively.  From 
the  total  of  52,337  SNPs  that  were  successfully  identi-
fied,  about  72%  and  79%  were  polymorphic  in  Hanwoos 
and  Holsteins,  respectively.  Polymorphic  and  fixed  SNPs 
were  not  distributed  uniformly  across  the  chromosomes 
within  breeds  or  between  the  two  breeds.  The  number 
of  fixed  SNPs  on  all  chromosomes  was  higher  in  Hanwoo 
cattle,  reflecting  the  genetic  uniqueness  of  the  Hanwoo 
breed.  In  general,  the  rate  of  polymorphisms  detected  in 
these  two  breeds  suggests  that  the  SNPs  can  be  used 
for  different  applications,  such  as  whole-genome  associ-
ation  and  comparative  genetic  studies,  and  are  a  helpful 
tool  in  developing  breed  identification  genetic  markers.

Introduction

The  application  of  molecular  markers  to  study  genetic 
variation  has  evolved  very  rapidly  since  the  mid-1960s 
(Avise,  2004).  The  dominance  of  protein  electrophoretic 
methods  to  study  population  genetics  occurred  in  the 
1970s,  which  was  replaced  by  the  use  of  restriction  en-
zyme  analysis  (animal  mtDNA,  DNA  fingerprinting,  sin-
gle-copy  nuclear  DNA)  in  the  1980s.  In  recent  decades, 
the  introduction  of  polymerase  chain  reaction  (e.g., 
STRs,  AFLP,  SNPs)-based  DNA  genotyping  approaches 
has  provided  the  first  rapid  and  easy  assay  for  genetic 
data  analysis.
    Single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  are  believed 
to  contain  applicable  genomic  information  and  have 
been  used  widely  as  genetic  markers  in  population  ge-
netics  and  molecular  ecology  studies.  To  date,  two  full 
genome  assemblies  for  bovines  are  available,  Btau_4.2 
and  UMD3.1  (Bovine  Genome  Sequencing  and  Analysis 
Consortium,  2009;  Zimin et al.,  2009).  The  availability  of 
genome  assemblies  led  to  the  development  of  the 
Illumina  Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  genotyping  array 
(Matukumalli et al.,  2009;  Van  Tassell et al.,  2009).  The 
Illumina  Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  (Illumina  Inc.)  com-
prises  54,001  evenly  spaced  SNP  probes.  The  chip 
presents  an  average  SNP  spacing  of  51.5  Kb  across  the 
entire  genome,  offering  more-than-sufficient  SNP  density 
for  different  applications,  including  whole-genome  asso-
ciation  studies,  genomic  selection,  evaluation  of  genetic 
merit,  and  comparative  genetic  studies  (Alam  et al., 
2011;  Kijas et al.,  2009;  Lee et al.,  2010;  Matukumalli et 
al.,  2009;  Michelizzi  et al.,  2011;  Uemoto  et al.,  2010; 
Wade  et al.,  2009). 
    Evaluations  of  genetic  merit  based  on  SNPs  have  be-
come  an  important  area,  leading  to  enhanced  genetic 
improvements  in  dairy  and  beef  breeds  (Hayes  et al., 
2009).  For  instance,  the  application  of  SNPs  for  quanti-
tative  trait  loci  detection  and  genomic  selection  practi-
ces  in  dairy  cattle  has  been  reported  (Cole et al.,  2009; 
Hayes et al.,  2009).  Genomic  selection  requires  a  careful 
understanding  of  the  level  of  SNPs  in  each  cattle  breed. 
The  SNPs  in  public  databases  are  not  validated,  and 
the  level  of  polymorphisms  is  unknown  for  many  cattle 
breeds.  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we  evaluated  SNP  fre-
quency  spectra  and  the  rate  of  polymorphisms  in  the 
Hanwoo  and  Holstein  breeds  using  the  Bovine  SNP50 
BeadChip  genotyping  array  to  facilitate  genomic  evalua-
tion  and  selection  of  the  Hanwoo  breed.

Methods

Molecular  data

(n=50)  cattle  of 

(n=50)  and  Holstein 

Blood  samples  were  collected  from  genetically  unrelated 
Hanwoo 
the 
Nonghyup  Animal  Genetic 
Improvement  Programs 
(http://www.limc.co.kr;  http://www.dcic.co.kr/).  Genomic 
DNA  was  extracted  based  on  laboratory  procedures. 
Approximately,  200  ng  of  genomic  DNA  was  used  to 
commercially  genotype  each  sample  on  the  Illumina 
Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  (SNP  Genetics,  Seoul).  Samples 
were  processed  according  to  the  Illumina  Infinium-II  as-
say  manual.  Each  sample  was  whole-genome-amplified, 
fragmented,  precipitated,  and  resuspended  in  an  appro-
priate  hybridization  buffer.  Denatured  samples  were  hy-
bridized  on  the  prepared  Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  for  a 
minimum  of  16  h  at  48oC.  Following  the  hybridization, 
the  BeadChips  were  processed  for  the  single-base  ex-
tension  reaction,  stained,  and  imaged  on  an  Illumina 
Bead  Array  Reader.  Normalized  bead  intensity  data  for 
each  sample  were  loaded  into  the  Beadstudio  3.0  soft-
ware  (Illumina),  which  converted  fluorescent  intensities 
into  SNP  genotypes.  SNP  clusters  for  genotype  calling 
were examined for all SNPs using Beadstudio 3.0 software.

Data  analysis

The  SNP  frequencies  were  estimated  from  the  genotypic 
data.  The  calculated  SNP  frequencies  were  used  to 
construct  figures  and  examine  rates  of  polymorphisms 
and  variable  frequency  spectra  in  the  two  breeds  using 
Microsoft  EXCEL  (2007)  and  SPSS  package,  version 
17.0.  The  significance  differences  in  SNP  distribution 
between  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  for  minor  allele  frequen-
cies  were  tested  using  SPSS.

woo  and  Holstein  breeds  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  A 
total  of  52,337  SNPs  were  detected  in  both  Hanwoo 
and  Holstein  genomes.  Approximately,  72%  of  these 
SNPs  fell  within  the  range  of  0.1  to  0.9  for  Hanwoo. 
Similarly,  Holstein  displayed  about  78%  of  these  SNPs, 
which  are  considered  suitable  markers  for  genomic 
evaluation.  The  smallest  SNP  frequency  that  could  be 
observed  in  this  study  was  0.010  for  Hanwoos  and 
0.0004  for  Holstein.
    Averaged  across  the  two  breeds,  75%  of  SNPs  dis-
played  polymorphisms,  which  indicates  that  the  majority 
of  the  identified  SNPs  can  represent  genetic  character-
istics  of  the  two  breeds.  On  the  other  hand,  about  27% 
(Hanwoo)  and  20%  (Holstein)  of  SNPs  were  mono-
morphic  in  the  current  analysis  (Fig.  1).
The  SNP  data  were  also  used  to  compare  minor  allele 
frequency  (MAF)  patterns  between  the  Hanwoo  and 
Holstein  breeds.  As  indicated  in  Fig.  2,  the  analysis  re-
vealed  a  highly  significant  (Pearson’s  χ2  test=865,  p＜ 
0.001)  difference  between  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  for  MAF 
spectra.  The  average  MAFs  were  0.19±0.16  and 
0.22±0.16  for  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  breeds,  respec-
tively.  The  intermediate  MAF  spectrum  was  similar  for 
both  breeds,  but  the  distribution  was  different  for  mono-
morphic  or  fixed  alleles.  Of  the  total  SNPs,  47%  of  the 

Hanwoo  comprised  less  common  variants  (≥0.05−≤

0.5). 
    Further  breakdown  of  the  distribution  of  MAFs  re-
vealed  that  25%  and  28%  highly  polymorphic  SNPs  (≥

0.3−≤0.5)  were  observed  in  the  Hanwoo  and  Holstein 

genomes,  respectively.  Hanwoo  displayed  a  higher  level 
of  monomorphic  SNPs  (9%),  which  was  significantly  (p
＜ 0.01)  higher  than  in  Holstein  (Fig.  1).  The  frequency 

of  rare  alleles  (＞0−＜0.05)  was  about  3,767  (7.2%)

Chromosomal  level  variations  in  SNPs

We  further  examined  the  distribution  of  SNPs  at  the 
chromosomal  level  (Fig.  3a,  b).  SNPs  were  not  uniformly 
distributed  over  the  entire  genome  of  all  chromosomes 
in  Hanwoo  or  Holstein.  Each  chromosome  consisted  of 
variable  number  of  polymorphic  and  fixed  SNPs  (Figure 
3a,  b).  The  two  breeds  generally  displayed  a  similar  pat-
tern  of  SNP  distribution  over  autosomes  and  X  chromo-
somes,  but  Holstein  had  a  relatively  higher  level  of  poly-
morphisms  on  all  chromosomes. 
    The  number  of  available  SNPs  on  a  chromosome  de-
pends  on  its  length.  From  this  investigation,  it  was  ob-
served  that  the  total  number  of  SNPs,  as  well  as  genet-
ic  variation,  was  the  lowest  for  the  X  chromosome.  The 
proportion  of  SNPs  on  X  chromosomes  was  about  0.9% 
(Hanwoo)  and  1%  (Holstein).  There  was  a  slight  differ-
ence  between  the  number  of  SNPs  reported  on  the 
BeadChip  and  the  present  study.  We  deleted  about 
1,679  SNPs  from  unknown  chromosomes  from  the  data

morphic  and  (b)  monomorphic

during  the  analysis;  this  could  be  the  reason  for  the 
difference.
    The  distribution  and  level  of  fixed  SNPs  across  the 
genome  of  these  animals  were  also  evaluated.  SNPs 
were  fixed  across  the  chromosomes  of  Hanwoo  and 
Holstein  (Fig.  3b).  It  was  also  observed  that  the  number 
of  fixed  SNPs  varied  across  chromosomes  and  between 
breeds.  The  number  of  fixed  SNPs  was  generally  higher 
in  Hanwoo  as  compared  to  Holstein  (Fig.  3b). 

Discussion

In  the  human  genome,  the  most  common  form  of  genet-
ic  variation  is  a  simple  change  of  a  base  pair,  a  single 
nucleotide  polymorphism  (Broeckel  and  Hessner,  2006). 
Population  history,  selection  pressure,  and  other  pop-
ulation  genetic  factors  determine  the  frequency  and  pat-
terns  of  SNPs  in  the  genome.  Hence,  in  this  study,  we 
were  interested  in  examining  the  frequency  spectra  of 
the  entire  genome,  comprising  52,337  SNPs  in  Hanwoo 
and  Holstein  breeds.  The  SNPs  detected  using  the 
Illumina  Bovine  SNP50  Chip  were  informative.  SNPs  that 
are  significantly  associated  with  one  population  but  not 
the  other  can  be  used  as  informative  SNPs  for  that  par-
ticular  breed.  The  chi-square  test  was  performed  to  in-
vestigate  allele  frequency  spectra  differences  between 
Hanwoo  and  Holstein.  The  test  revealed  a  significant 
variation  in  MAF  proportion  between  the  two  breeds. 
This  genetic  difference,  detected  from  allele  frequency 
spectra,  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  Hanwoo  and 
Holstein  have  followed  unique  evolutionary  pathways  in 
different  geographic  locations.
    The  majority  of  SNPs  in  public  databases  has  not 
been  validated  in  several  cattle  breeds,  and  the  level  of 
polymorphisms  is  unknown  for  many  cattle  breeds  in 
the  world.  This  may  limit  the  application  of  SNPs,  such 
as  for  population  structure  or  whole-genome  association 
studies.  In  this  preliminary  study,  about  37,971  and 
41,724  polymorphic  SNPs  were  detected  in  Hanwoos 
and  Holsteins,  respectively,  with  an  average  poly-
morphism  rate  of  75%.  In  future  genome-wide  associa-
tion  and  population  genetics  studies,  the  selection  of 
highly  polymorphic  SNPs  is  paramount  to  guarantee  the 
most  optimal  result.  In  another  study,  Matukumalli et al. 
(2009)  used  the  Bovine  SNP50  BeadChip  and  found  that 
the  number  of  SNPs  with  minor  allele  frequencies  of  ≥
0.05  ranged  from  31,633  to  42,711  among  14  taurine 
breeds,  from  28,823  to  35,425  between  two  African 
breeds,  and  from  23,284  to  30,139  among  three  indicine 
breeds.  About  30%  of  SNPs  had  MAFs  ＞0.3  within  the 
taurine  breeds,  and  only  about  19%  had  MAFs  ＞0.3 
within  the  indicine  breeds  (Bovine  HapMap  Consortium, 
2009).  In  sheep,  averaged  across  the  breeds,  81%  of 

SNPs  displayed  polymorphisms,  which  indicates  that  the 
majority  of  identified  SNPs  predates  the  radiation  of  the 
domestic  breeds  that  were  sampled  (Kijas et al.,  2009). 
    The  number  of  polymorphic  and  monomorphic  SNPs 
was  not  uniformly  distributed  across  the  chromosomes 
between  the  two  breeds  or  within  a  breed.  The  number 
of  polymorphic  SNPs  was  higher  in  Holstein  on  all 
chromosomes.  In  contrast,  several  alleles  were  mono-
morphic  in  Hanwoo,  meaning  that  only  a  single  fixed 
gene  was  present.  As  alleles  became  fixed  in  Hanwoo, 
there  was  an  overall  decline  in  heterozygosity  as  the 
breed  became  homozygous  for  one  allele  or  the  other. 
In  the  past,  if  the  Hanwoo  population  remained  small 
and  isolated  for  several  generations,  there  was  a  possi-
bility  of  random  fixation  and  the  loss  of  some  alleles  by 
genetic  drift.  We  also  hypothesize  that  high  levels  of  al-
lelic  fixation  may  reflect  a  certain  level  of  inbreeding. 
Previously,  Lee  et al.  (2010)  reported  that  average  in-
breeding  varied  from  0.00%  to  0.97%  and  that  the  aver-
age  annual  rate  of  increase  in  inbreeding  was  0.14%  in 
Hanwoo.  Therefore,  the  level  of  inbreeding  in  Hanwoo  is 
still  low  and  may  not  be  a  major  concern.  Generally,  ge-
netic  variability  in  Hanwoo  should  provide  balance  in  a 
gene  pool  and  also  offer  genetic  variants  for  natural  and 
artificial  selection.  Furthermore,  the  current  breeding 
strategy  implemented  for  Hanwoo  cattle  in  Korea  should 
also  focus  on  minimizing  genetic  homogeneity  and 
maintaining  genetic  uniqueness  of  the  breed  while  im-
proving  beef  production.
    In  conclusion,  Hanwoo  and  Holstein  cattle  have  a  sig-
nificant  variation  of  genomic  SNP  (alleles)  frequency 
spectra,  implying  that  the  breeds  follow  unique  evolu-
tionary  paths  that  lead  to  genetic  differences  between 
the  two  breeds.  The  rate  of  SNP  polymorphisms  de-
tected  in  these  two  breeds  suggests  that  the  SNPs 
could  potentially  be  used  in  genomic  evaluations  and  as 
a  helpful  tool  in  developing  breed  identification  genetic 
markers.
