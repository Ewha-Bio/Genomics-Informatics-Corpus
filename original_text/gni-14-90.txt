Nuclear mitochondrial DNA segment (Numt) insertion describes a well-known phenomenon of mitochondrial DNA transfer 
into a eukaryotic nuclear genome. However, it has not been well understood, especially in plants. Numt insertion patterns 
vary from species to species in different kingdoms. In this study, the patterns were surveyed in nine plant species, and we 
found some tip-offs. First, when the mitochondrial genome size is relatively large, the portion of the longer Numt is also 
larger than the short one. Second, the whole genome duplication event increases the ratio of the shorter Numt portion in the 
size distribution. Third, Numt insertions are enriched in exon regions. This analysis may be helpful for understanding plant 
evolution.

Introduction

From the beginning of endosymbiosis between the origin 
eukaryote cell and alphaproteobacteria, the phenomenon of 
mitochondrial  gene  transfer  to  the  host  cell  is  still  an 
ongoing  evolutionary  process  [1,  2].  It  is  termed  nuclear 
mitochondrial DNA (Numt), pronounced “new might” [3]. 
In general, the mutation rate of nuclear DNA is lower than 
that of the mitochondrial genome. For this reason, Numt is 
often called a molecular fossil and is used as a molecular 
marker for speciation events in evolution [4, 5]. While Numt 
insertion is a well-known phenomenon, the mechanism of 
DNA insertion into the nuclear genome is not clear. One of 
the strongly supported hypotheses is that during the process 
of  double-strand  break  repair,  an  absorbed  mitochondrial 
DNA  fragment  is  inserted  into  the  nuclear  genome  via  a 
non-homologous end joining event [6-9].

After  whole-genome  sequencing  was  finished,  Numt 
analysis was performed in various species: cat, cattle, dog, 
fruit fly, gorilla, grasshopper, goose, horse, horseshoe bat, 
honeybee, human, maize, squirrel, and whale [10-17]. One 
review paper summarized all existences of Numt in complete 
genome sequences [18]. In the case of whale, a phylogenetic 

analysis of Numts with six whale species was carried out, 
establishing Numt as an evolutionary marker in speciation 
events [19]. In plant, a recent study discovered that Numt 
insertion  is  dispersed  throughout  the  periphery  of  the 
centromere [20]. But, there are many barriers in plant Numt 
analyses. Genomic complexity is a big problem in not only 
the  nuclear  genome  but  also  the  mitochondrial  genome 
[21-23].

In this article, Numts of two green algae (Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii  and  Coccomyxa  subellipsoidea),  three  monocots 
(Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, and Zea mays), and four eudicots 
(Vitis  vinifera,  Glycine  max,  Brassica  rapa,  and  Arabidopsis 
thaliana), for which whole-genome nuclear and mitochondrial 
sequences are publically available, were detected using the 
nucleotide-nucleotide  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool 
(BLASTN)  searches  and  subjected  to  a  basic  analysis  for 
their  fundamental  properties,  which  will  be  required  in 
further comparative genome analyses in plants.

Methods
Data sources

We  downloaded  all  of  the  genomic  data  and  gene 
annotation data (gff3) of two green algae genomes (C. rein-
hardtii and C. subellipsoidea) from the Joint Genome Institute, 
four  plant  genomes  (O.  sativa,  Z.  mays,  V.  vinifera,  and  A. 
thaliana)  from  the  Ensembl  genome  database,  two  plant 
genomes (G. max and S. bicolor) from the Plant Genome Da-
tabase, and the B. rapa genome and annotation information 
data, available online from the B. rapa Database. We also 
collected  each  mitochondrial  genome  sequence  from  the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). All 
these data sources are summarized in Table 1.

Detection of Numts and data generation

Plant  Numt  insertions  were  identified  using  BLASTN 
local alignment tools in the BLAST program package (ver. 
2.2.26), with mitochondrial genomic DNA as a query seq-
uence and each genome dataset as a BLAST database. The 
execution  options  included  an  e-value  cutoff  set  to  0.01, 
filtering switched off (-dust no), a mismatch penalty of –2, 
and a word size of 9. The neighboring Numt hits within 10 kb 
were,  if  necessary,  merged  into  a  single  event  of  Numt 
insertions. All of these analytical processes were carried out 
with in-house Python codes.

length information, we estimated the portion of each feature 
by  dividing  the  total  length  of  each  feature  (Si)  by  each 
whole-genome length (G). The relative abundance (RAi) of 
each feature was then calculated as follows:

RAi = Ci / (Si/G)

, where Ci is the count of the genic feature i in a species.

Results and Discussion

All of the data are summarized in Table 2. The genome size 
of the nine plants species varied from 48 Mb to 2 Gb. The 
mitochondria genome size also varied from 15.8 kb to 773 
kb. There was no correlation between whole-genome size 
and mitochondrial whole-genome size. We drew a correlation 
chart between whole nuclear genome length and the sum of 
the inserted Numt lengths (Fig. 1). The larger the genome 
size, the more nuclear mitochondrial insertions there were. 
This confirms a previous study result [18]. The added green 
algae  species  also  showed  this  tendency.  One  of  the  pe-
culiarities of plant species is their many Numt hits. Except 
for  green  algae  (C.  reinhardtii  and  C.  subellipsoidea),  the 
number  of  BLAST  hits  after  merging  all  overlapping  hits 
ranged  from  770  for  A.  thaliana  to  14,509  for  V.  vinifera. 
Furthermore, when integrating all of the neighboring hits 
within 10 kb into one single event, the hit count ranged from 
562 in A. thaliana to 9,022 in V. vinifera. This implies that the 
transposition  of  mitochondrial  DNA  of  plants  into  chro-
mosomal DNA is more preferable than in whale species [19].
Next, we examined the size distribution of the inserted 
Numts. Here, we merged the neighboring hits within 10 kb

by  plant  species.

we gathered the length information of the categories, such as 
gene,  coding  sequence  (CDS),  exon,  pseudogene,  and 
noncoding  RNA  (ncRNA)  (tRNA,  rRNA,  and  long  non-
coding RNA [lncRNA]), from the gene annotation files of 
each species (gff3 format). The total length of exons and 
introns included only the protein-coding genes. The total 
length of introns was computed by subtracting the total exon 
length  from  the  sum  of  all  gene  lengths.  With  all  of  the

into single events. The merged hits showed a high degree of 
variation in size—the shortest and largest being 25 bp and 
107 kb, respectively (Table 2). The size distribution of Numt 
was also quite variable between species (Fig. 2). Over 70% of 
Numts were less than 400 bp in all of the analyzed plants. 
Green algae species that had shorter mitochondrial DNA 
than other species had over 80% in the group with less than 
200  bp,  especially  in  C.  reinhardtii (over  96%).  V.  vinifera, 
which has a larger mitochondrial genome size than other 
plants, included 30% of Numts over 1 kb in size, and half of 
this group was over  5 kb. Z. mays, which  has  the largest 
genome and the second largest mitochondrial genome, and 
B. rapa, which has a relatively shorter genome than Z. mays, 
showed similar ratio distributions. In general, species having 
short  mitochondrial  genomes  had  a  large  ratio  of  short 
Numts. When comparing monocots and eudicots, there was 
no clearly shared feature. But, there were some differences 
when contrasting green algae and land plants. However, it is 
not  a  matter  of  the  species  group  but  rather  a  matter  of 
genomic size variation. There are two kinds of closely related 
speciation events: one is between A. thaliana and B. rapa, and 
the other is between S. bicolor and Z. mays. In each of the 
speciation events, there were whole-genome triplication or 
duplication events, leading to B. rapa and Z. mays [24, 25]. 
Because of that, each pair has a similar genomic content, but 
the within-pair Numt size distribution patterns are different. 
In general, B. rapa and Z. mays have lower ratios of long sizes 
of Numts than A. thaliana and S. bicolor, respectively. Genome 
triplication or duplication events may have split the long 

Table  3.  Numt  counts  by  genic  features

Numt sequences, such that the number of long Numts was 
reduced. These patterns were also observed in the speciation 
between G. max and V. vinifera.

In the previous whale Numt study [19], they also perfor-
med a Numt size distribution analysis. The average whale 
genome  size  is  2.5  Gb,  and  the  average  mitochondrial 
genome size is 16 kb. It has a much larger nuclear genome 
and  smaller  mitochondrial genome.  In  whales, the Numt 
size group over 5 kb is under 2%, but in plants, it is over 4%, 
and in V. vinifera, it is over 17%. It is presumed that as a result 
of  a  20-fold  larger  mitochondrial  genome,  even  if  going 
through the second whole-genome duplication event, there 
are  longer  Numt  sequences  that  still  reside  in  the  plant 
genome.

The next analysis was the classification of Numt insertion 
loci by genic features (Table 3). In land plants, a substantial 
portion of Numt hits lay in intergenic regions, except for 
green algae, where over 70% of the hits were found within 
genic boundaries. Within genic regions, over 90% of the hits 
overlapped exons. This is in contrast with the Numt hits in 
animals, like whales, where the total number of Numt hits 
was quite low and in which fewer hits were found in exons 
than in introns [19]. When we calculated the relative abun-
dance of each genic feature after accounting for the total size 
of each genic feature, the exon was the most enriched in 
most plants (Fig. 3). Considering the importance of exons in 
biological processes, it may be tempting to speculate that the 
numerous  Numt  insertions  into  exons  may  affect  the 
diversity of plant phenotypes.

Many  research  studies  on  Numt  analysis  have  been 
performed. But, they usually lack details on Numts, such as 
the  correlation  between  genome  size  and  inserted  Numt 
size, Numt size distribution ratio, loci classification by gene 
annotation, and so on. Our general basic analysis shows an 
interesting  tendency  but  is  still  not  enough  to  infer  the 
biological meaning. Currently, not many plant genomes have 
been completely sequenced, and furthermore, their accuracy 
is somewhat compromised due to high repeat contents or 
high  heterozygosity  in  the  genomes.  In  order  to  draw  a 
clearer picture of the effect of Numt insertion in the nuclear 
genome,  more  population-level  genomic  data  and  more 
accurate genome sequences may be required. Nevertheless, 
Numts  may  be  one  of  the  key  clues  of  the  mysterious 
biological implications of genomic analysis.
