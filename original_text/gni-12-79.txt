Transposable elements (TEs) are genetic elements that 
have the potential to move from one site to another in the 
genome.  Therefore,  TEs  mediate  diverse  recombination 
events and eventually can contribute to genomic evolution. 
In  addition,  TEs  contribute  to  genomic  instability  and 
diverse  diseases,  including  cancer.  However,  the  mecha-
nisms and extent of disease contribution of TEs are not well 
known yet. Regarding these areas, three review papers are 
reported  in  this  issue.  Dr.  Byung-Dong  Kim  of  Seoul 
National University reviewed foldback intercoil (FBI) DNA 
and the mechanism of DNA transposition mediated by FBI. 
In this review, he introduced the FBI DNA element and the 
mechanistic features that are relevant to the application of 
FBI  DNA  to  the  mechanisms  of  DNA  transposition.  Dr. 
Nam-Soo  Kim’s  group  of  Kangwon  National  University 
reviewed genome size variations in plants in relation to TEs. 
Of all eukaryotes, TEs are especially prevalent in plants. The 
extreme  genomic  size  variation  of  plants  has  posited  a 
conundrum  in  evolutionary  genetics.  The  authors  intro-
duced genomic size variations in relation to TEs using some 
examples, such as the Liliaceae family, known to have large 
genomes  in  angiosperms.  Dr.  Heui-Soo  Kim’s  group  of 

Pusan  National  University  reviewed  the  biological  impli-
cations of TEs in genomic evolution, genetic instability, and 
diverse  human  diseases.  They  gave  an  overview  of  the 
importance  of  TEs  in  studying  genomic  evolution  and 
genetic  instability  and  suggested  that  further  in-depth 
studies on the mechanisms related to these phenomena will 
be useful for clinical applications. There is another intere-
sting review regarding epigenetic regulation in this issue. Dr. 
Joomyeong  Kim’s  group  of  Louisiana  State  University 
introduced the regulation and function of the Peg3 imprinted 
domain. The authors summarized the information that we 
have learned so far regarding the Peg3 domain and discussed 
the similarities and differences between the Peg3 and other 
imprinted domains. The other three articles are the Korean 
Association Resource (KARE) data genomic analysis award 
winners. The analysis of KARE data from young scientists’ 
creative points of view has generated new interpretations 
and interesting evidence, which we should pay attention to 
in future studies.  

Genomics  &  Informatics  is  already  available  in  PubMed 
Central  and  PubMed.  Recently,  Genomics  &  Informatics 
applied to be listed in SCOPUS.
