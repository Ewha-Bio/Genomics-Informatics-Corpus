Abstract
Due to the increasing interest in SNPs and mutational hot 
spots for disease traits, it is becoming more important to 
define and understand the relationship between SNPs and 
their flanking sequences. To study the effects of flanking 
sequences on SNPs, statistical approaches are necessary 
to assess bias in SNP data. In this study we mainly applied 
Markov  chains  for  SNP  sequences,  particularly  those 
located in intronic regions, and for analysis of in-del data. 
All  of  the  pertaining  sequences  showed  a  significant 
tendency  to  generate  particular  SNP  types.  Most 
sequences flanking SNPs had lower complexities than 
average sequences, and some of them were associated 
with microsatellites. Moreover, many Alu repeats were 
found in the flanking sequences. We observed an elevated 
frequency  of  single-base-pair  repeat-like  sequences, 
mirror  repeats,  and  palindromes  in  the  SNP  flanking 
sequence  data.  Alu  repeats  are  hypothesized  to  be 
associated with C-to-T transition mutations or A-to-I RNA 
editing. In particular, the in-del data revealed an association 
between particular changes such as palindromes or mirror 
repeats. Results indicate that the mechanism of induction 
of in-del transitions is probably very different from that 
which is responsible for other SNPs. From a statistical 
perspective,  frequent  DNA  lesions  in  some  regions 
probably have effects on the occurrence of SNPs.

Introduction
The genomes of different individuals typically differ by 
millions of nucleotides, due in part to inheritance and de 
novo  formation  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs). There are more than 3,000,000 known SNPs in 
the human genome. SNPs have been studied extensively 
due to the high density genetic markers linked to disease 
risk, patient outcome, response to specific treatments and 
treatment side effects (Taylor et al., 2001). A set of SNPs 
suitable for research purposes can be retrieved from public 
databases, the largest of which is dbSNP. This database 
contained more than 10 million reference SNP records in 
2001 (Sherry et al., 2001). With increasing interest in SNPs 
and mutational hot spots for disease traits, it is becoming 
more important to define and understand the relationship 
between SNPs and their flanking sequences.

Mutations mainly occur in one of two ways: as a result 
of replication errors such as mismatches or frame shifts 
(Roos et al., 1996), or as a result of nucleotide alterations 
due to mutagens or radiation exposure (Ikehata et al., 
2004).  Mutations  can  form  differently  under  various 
constraints, and there are many factors associated with the 
failure of DNA repair. We believe that SNPs could be the 
effect  of  such  failures  and  their  original  sequences 
(especially their flanking sequences) could be the cause. 
Despite the possibility of the post hoc, ergo propter hoc 
fallacy,  SNP  location  can  be  an  important  constraint. 
Firstly,  mutation  rates  vary  among  regions  of  the 
mammalian genomes (Wolfe et al., 1989). For example, 
rates of frameshift mutation for runs of T's and A's are higher 
than those for runs of C's and G's, and the complementary 
strands  of  DNA  differ  with  respect  to  replication  and 
transcription (Burns et al., 1994; Francino et al., 1997). 
Secondly, location can affect SNPs, and the density of 
SNPs varies with the region involved (The International 
SNP Map Working Group, 2001). In this study, we aimed 
to  detect  statistically  significant  relationships  between 
SNPs and their flanking sequences, since some flanking 
sequences may influence particular SNPs.

Studies regarding the linguistic properties of nucleotide 
sequences were initiated soon after the first long DNA 
sequences became available (Brendel et al., 1986). Since 
the Markov chain model is useful in identifying biased 
sequences, we applied this model to detect SNP biases 
with respect to the flanking sequences. We developed 

methods designed to identify contrast words; those that are 
significantly over or under-represented by comparison 
with a model (Burge et al., 1992). We present the model 
employed for these purposes, together with the statistical 
procedure for identifying biased sequences.

Methods
Statistical methods
The Markov chain model was used to analyze the biases 
of SNPs and their flanking sequences (Schbath et al., 
1995). The Markov chain model enabled us to deduce the 
number of occurrences of SNP biases that are the net 
effects of the flanking sequences by reading whole given 
nucleotide  sequences.  In  this  research,  we  assigned 
different Markov orders, such as 1, 3, 5, and 7, to remove 
the effects of bias of flanking nucleotides which include 
mono-, di-, tri-, up to tetra-nucleotides.

Let W = (w1 w2 … wm) be the word made by concatenation 
of m nucleotides and N(W) be its observed count in a 
sequence, which has a length of m. Under the Markov 
maximal order model (Leung et al., 1996), the expected 
count of W, E(W), is calculated by

 …     … 

 …   

Having obtained the theoretical expectation for a count 
of the word, we needed a statistical way to compare it with 
the actual observed count in a statistically meaningful way. 
In this work, we used the z value statistics proposed by 
Schbath  et  al.  (1997),  where  var(W)  represents  the 
calculated variance of N(W) - E(W). The main advantage 
of using the z value is that it follows a reduced normal 
distribution for a sufficiently large value of N(W) (Schbath 
et al., 1995).

The z value is the measure of the bias of a word in a text. 
When the z value drops to zero, it indicates that there is ‘no 
bias’ of the word in a genomic text, while a large negative z 
value indicates that there is an ‘under-representation’ and 
a large positive z value indicates that there is an ‘over- 
representation’.  For  large  sequences  and  counts,  the 
variance for the maximal Markov model can be approximated 
by the following expression (Schbath et al., 1995).

A Statistical Analysis of SNPs and Their Flanking Sequence 69

For each word W, we counted the number of occurrences 
of  the  word  in  the  given  sequences  and  computed  its 
expected frequency and variance using the count of smaller 
words and the previous formula. We then tested whether 
the z value was significant or not, i.e. if it was compatible 
with the assumptions of the Markov model. Since we knew 
that z values are distributed in a normal distribution, we 
needed to elucidate whether the absolute z value was 
higher than a given threshold, which is 3.29 for 1% or 1.96 
for 5% statistical significance, for a single test.

In this study, the Markov chain model was used to 
evaluate the significance of a word by taking into account 
the distribution of words of size m - 2, which measures the 
significance of an individual word only when all bias caused 
by the words of smaller sizes are removed. If a motif is 
degenerate, i.e. not strictly conserved in comparison with 
its consensus sequence, we can detect less significant 
results because this approach is used to count only exact 
words. If we include insertions and deletions in our count, 
the approach may be more accurate. Another important 
point lies in the definition of a ‘significantly’ biased word. 
Whichever statistic and model are used, the significance 
of the deviation between N(W) and E(W) varies with the 
counts of N(W) because the statistical test can distinguish 
a small deviation with higher accuracy when the counts are 
larger.  For  this  reason,  we  also  defined  and  labelled 
difference value to sequences that had a large z value.

Data sources and programs
Human SNP sequences were obtained from the NCBI 
database, namely dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 
SNP/) (Benson et al., 2000). Because dbSNP is one of the 
largest SNP databases, providing user-friendly options, 
those  SNPs  that  were  validated  by  cluster,  frequency, 
submitter, and double hit were selected. For example, 
1,600,949 out of 3,245,651 intron sequences were identified 
to be validated. We excluded those sequences that had 
flanking sequences that were too short or had a significant 
number of missing characters denoted by N. There were 
no identical sequences in the NCBI database. Among eight 
functional classes in the NCBI database, we primarily 
analyzed intronic regions. To have an appropriate option, 
we  used  SNPs  that  had  a  true  single  nucleotide 
polymorphism with two alleles. We also tested other SNP 
classes such as in-dels. The flanking-sequence-checking 
software was written in C++, which is freely accessible at 
http://plaza.snu.ac.kr/~best/essay/FCP.zip.

mononucleotides flanking SNPs is very different from a 
normal distribution (Fig. 1A). A few sequences have values 
close to zero, meaning that there is no bias. Among the 
highest  12  SNPs  and  their  flanking  mononucleotides 
shown in the Table 1, all the sequences had the approximate 

Table 1. SNPs and their flanking mononucleotides.

Results
We gleaned some insights from the analysis of SNPs and 
their flanking sequences in genomic intronic regions. Even 
though functionally, introns are somewhat disregarded in 
eukaryotes, some SNPs in intronic regions may play an 
important role by affecting the expression level of relevant 
genes or proteins (Liu et al., 2004). Some RNA editing in 
intronic regions are considered to affect splicing sites and 
modulate splice site selection (Flomen et al., 2004).

Biases of the mononucleotides flanking SNPs
We studied genomic intron data because of its abundance 
in the database, and because there are fewer biological 
constraints in intronic regions compared to functional or 
exonic regions (although there are functional regions in 
introns). Mononucleotides flanking SNPs were analyzed 
by the Markov chain model to find higher absolute z values 
(Table 1). A high absolute z value indicated that the SNPs 
and their flanking nucleotides appeared to be significantly 
biased in intronic regions. The histogram distribution of the

same z value with respect to their reverse or complementary 
sequences except in the cases of T[A/T]A and A[A/T]T. The 
z value of T[A/T]A is 40.10, over-represented, and that of 
A[A/T]T is -12.75, under-represented. Interestingly, the 
same mononucleotides flanking SNPs such as T[A/G]T, 
A[T/C]A were over-represented.

Biases of the dinucleotides flanking SNPs
We also used the Markov chain model to analyze SNPs 
and their flanking dinucleotides. Histogram distribution of 
the dinucleotides flanking SNPs can be approximated by 
a normal distribution (Fig. 1B). However, the distribution 
of the dinucleotides flanking SNPs is wide, and the small 
peaks around a z value of 18 are due to over-represented 
sequences in Figure 1B. Interestingly, in this analysis, there 
was a significant portion of over-represented sequences 
among sequences that have high absolute z values (Table 
2). In most cases, the flanking dinucleotides consisted of 
double bases like AA, TT, CC, and GG. Also the first 
base-pair of the left flanking dinucleotides and the last 
base-pair of the right flanking dinucleotides had a high 
tendency  to  be  the  same  as  shown  in  GA[T/C]GG, 
CC[A/G]TC, CA[T/C]GC, and GC[A/G]TG. This symmetrical 
pattern of SNPs was consistently observed and hypothesized 
to be responsible for the over-represented sequences.

The  twelve  greatest  z  values  in  the  results  of  the 
dinucleotides  flanking  SNPs  were  positive,  and  the 
greatest z values were from the results of the mononucleotide 
to the tetranucleotide transition. We presume that biases 
normally lie on the over-represented sequences in such a 
way  that  some  flanking  sequences  stimulate  DNA  to 
generate SNPs, and these sequences are under biological 
constraints that are weakest near the SNP sites, or that it 
is  hard  to  repair  DNA  around  the  over-represented 
sequences.

Biases of the trinucleotides flanking SNPs
The trinucleotides flanking SNP analysis found that the 
over-represented sequences were symmetrical around 
the SNPs and behaved as microsatellites (Table 3). In our 
test, z values were distributed in a normal distribution. 
However,  the  human  genome  is  filled  with  repeated 
sequences such as microsatellites. So most symmetrical 
sequences  are  slightly  over-represented  due  to  their 
conserved repeat motif. We should endeavour to interpret 
results carefully when using the Markov chain model. The 
results of the trinucleotides flanking SNPs were generally 
similar to those of the dinucleotides flanking SNPs. The 
histogram distribution of the trinucleotides flanking SNPs 
can be approximated by a normal distribution (Fig. 1C). 
This histogram has a narrow bell shape but the distribution 
of the trinucleotides flanking SNPs is wide because of a few 
highly over-represented sequences.

Numerous  over-represented  sequences  had  large 
absolute z values. In the cases of CCC[A/G]AGT and

ACT[T/C]GGG, both had high z and difference values. Both 
sequences  were  parts  of  specific  motifs  such  as 
CCTCAGCCTCCC[A/G]AGTAGCT GGGAC and GTCC 
CAGCTACT[T/C]GGG AGGCTGAGG. They are probably 
related to Alu repeats (ATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGCC 
GAGG [GenBank:551 542]). There are a few single-base-pair 
repeat-like sequences such as TTT[T/C]TTT and AAA[A/G]AAA 
which  were  also  over-represented.  However,  these 
showed relatively low difference values. The over-represented 
sequences showed a much lower complexity. The left and 
right flanking bases had a tendency to be the same. We 
also found that, in 16 out of the 30 cases of the highest 
absolute z value sequences, the first base-pair of the left 
group of trinucleotides and the last base-pair of the right 
group  of  trinucleotides  were  the  same,  for  example 
CTC[A/G]CTC,  ACA[T/C]GCA,  GAC[A/G]GGG,  and 
GTT[T/C]GAG. Usually, they were located in various single 
base-pair repeat regions or microsatellite regions. Since 
these sequences had high positive z values, we presume 
that they were over-represented partly because of their 
single-base-pair rich sequences and partly because of 
their microsatellite repeats. For example, GAC[A/G]GGG 
sequences were not symmetrical but the sequences were 
G-rich.  Although  these  were  single  base-pair  rich 
sequences, other sequences turned out to be microsatellites 
such as CTC[A/G]CTC and ACA[T/C]ACA. 

Microsatellites  are  frequently  observed  in  human 
genomes, and they have conserved repeat motifs. Most 
symmetrical  sequences  are  slightly  over-represented 
because  of  their  conserved  repeat  motifs.  However, 
microsatellites are highly polymorphic markers and their 
length varies due to a high rate of mutation. To some extent, 
biological constraints do not affect microsatellite regions. 
Some highly over-represented SNP sequences may be 
caused by DNA slippage, which results in the loss of proper 
hydrogen bonding in DNA (Levinson et al., 1987). SNPs 
can easily be formed by Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) 
mutations as well as by hydrogen bond losses. We also 
found  combinations  of  two  microsatellites  that  were 
symmetrical around SNPs such as ATA[T/C]ACA and 
TAT[A/G]TGT. We found many AT and AC repeats in 
ATA[T/C]ACA sequences. In this case, it was considered 
that SNPs were formed by two SSR mutations in the 
upstream  and  downstream  regions  of  SNPs.  This  is 
plausible because SSR mutation rate is much higher than 
SNP mutation rate, even though the loci of SSR mutations 
are restricted (Brinkmann et al., 1998). In the case of 
GTG[T/C]GCG,  the  assumption  of  SSR  mutation  was 
barely  applied  because  GC  repeats  are  greatly 
under-represented in the human genome (International 
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001). However, 
GTG[T/C]GCG had a very high difference value. C-to-T 

transition mutations, the most abundant SNP type, could 
probably be used to explain this phenomenon best. In 
humans, DNA methylation occurs predominantly at CpG 
dinucleotides and plays an essential role in many transcription 
processes, such as development, and X-chromosome 
inactivation (Robertson et al., 2000). These methylated 
sites are considered to exhibit high rates of C-to-T transition 
mutations (Zingg et al., 1997).

Biases of the tetranucleotides flanking SNPs
The  results  from  the  tetranucleotides  flanking  SNPs 
showed a strong relationship with Alu repeats (Table 4). 
Since Alu repeats are very frequent in the human genome 
and have conserved motifs, these results showed high 
difference values despite their low observed and expected 
counts. No identical sequences were discovered in the 
NCBI database. Histogram distribution of the tetranucleotides 
flanking SNPs can be approximated by a normal distribution 
(Fig. 1D). However, two sequences are highly over-represented. 
Also, two sequences are highly under-represented as a 
result of the over-represented sequences. We ceased 
further inspection after the analysis of the tetranucleotides 
flanking  SNPs  due  to  a  lower  number  of  each  SNP 
sequence.

We discovered that the sequences AGGC[A/G]TGAG, 
CTCA[T/C]GCCT, CCAC[T/C]GCAC, GTGC[A/G]GTGG, 
TCAC[T/C]GCAA, ATCA[T/C]GCCA, ATCC[A/G]CCTG, 
CAGG[T/C]GGAT, and GAGG[T/C]GGAG had Alu motifs 
such as GGGATAACAGGC[A/G]TGAGCCACTGCG and 
its  reverse  complement  CACGGTGGCTCA[T/C]GCC 
TGTAATCCC [GenBank: 15145591], GGTGTGAGCCA

A Statistical Analysis of SNPs and Their Flanking Sequence 73

AGGCTGGAGTGC[A/G]GTGGCTCATTCC  [GenBank: 
21322214], AGCTCGGCTCAC[T/C]GCAACCTCCGCC 
[GenBank: 15809152], GAGCCGAGATCA[T/C]GCCAC 
TGCACTC  [GenBank:  33667252],  ACCTGGTGATCC 
[A/G]CCTGCCTCGGCC  and  its  reverse  complement 
GGCCGAGGCAGG[T/C]GGATCACCTGAG [GenBank: 
2895321],  and  GGACTAAGGAGG[T/C]GGAGCTTGC 
AGT [GenBank: 18450199], respectively. Alleles of almost 
all  sequences  were  [A/G]  or  [T/C].  Moreover,  these 
sequences had CpG-like motifs such as [T/C]G, and its 
reverse complement C[A/G]. Alu repeats are known to be 
associated with C-to-T transition or RNA editing (Kim et al., 
2004).  Individual  Alu  elements  have  24  or  more  CpG 
dinucleotides that are easy to mutate as a result of the 
deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues (Batzer et al., 
1993). Alu CpGs account for about one-third of the potential 
methylation sites in human DNA (Hellmann-Blumberg et 
al., 2005). Alu repeats may also be related to adenosine 
deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) editing (Eisenberg et 
al., 2005). This study shows that some of the SNP databases 
actually display somatic modification, namely A-to-I RNA 
editing (Knight et al., 1996). Alu repeats can be used as 
the evolutionary mechanism and can actually influence the 
accumulation of SNPs in the genome (Batzer et al., 1995).
The  sequence  AAAA[A/T]ATAT  had  an  Alu  motif 
represented by AAAAAAAAA AAA[A/T]ATATATATATAT 
[Gen-Bank:2275185]. The 3’ terminus of the Alu element 
almost  always  consists  of  a  run  of  A’s  that  is  only 
occasionally interspersed with other bases (Levanon et al., 
2004). In addition, individual Alu repeats are also flanked 
by short (A+T)-rich direct repeated sequences that form 
when the elements integrate into staggered chromosomal 
breaks, and are thought to have appeared as a result of 
the  endonucleolytic  activity  of  LINE-derived  reverse 
transcriptase  (Jurka,  1997).  However,  in  the  case  of 
AAAA[A/T]ATAT  data,  many  simple  TA  repeats  were 
found after the 3’ oligo(dA)-rich tails of Alu elements.

Biases in in-del data
We analyzed the mononucleotides flanking in-del to test 
the Markov chain model with different data, and to find the 
highest absolute z values in in-del data (Table 5), although 
this model has been used in other studies (Schbath et al., 
1995; Leung et al., 1996; Schbath, 1997; Rocha et al., 
1998). The number of validated data in in-dels was 6,963. 
While in-del sequences that have the same left and right 
mononucleotides were significantly under-represented, 
sequences that have the different mononucleotides flanking 
in-dels were over-represented; the opposite result from the 
mononucleotides flanking SNPs (Table 1). This suggests 
that the formation of in-del variation is significantly different 
from that of SNPs and that the Markov chain model is a good

model to find different biases in various data sets. In the 
in-del data, few mirror repeats were observed in the flanking 
sequences. However, we did find some palindromes and 
mirror repeats in the alleles of the in-del data. Particularly, 
many long tandem repeats were found in relatively large 
alleles of the in-del data. There were 40 in-del sequences, 
the alleles of which were 24 bps or larger in nucleotide 
length.  We  found  approximately  8  putative  stem  loop 
structures that consisted of 4 or more base-pair hairpins 
among these 40 alleles (Table 6). For example, the allele 
of rs16434 ([-/TCCCACGCGAGTGTGGTGGGACCTTG]) 
has a stem loop structure (underlined) [dbSNP:rs16434]. 
We found approximately 9 mirror repeats that consisted of 
4 or more bp units among the 40 alleles (Table 7). For 
example, the allele of rs1610903 ([-/GGTGAGGGTGA 
GGGTATATGGGGAGT]) has mirror repeats (underlined) 
[dbSNP:rs1610903]. H-DNA can also be formed in mirror 
repeats (Mirkin et al., 1987).

Discussion
As for the comparison of histogram distributions, biases of 
the mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides flanking SNPs 
could be observed clearly (Fig. 2). The mononucleotides 
flanking SNPs had an effect on a large percentage of the

total number of SNP sequences (Fig. 2). Moreover, the 
distribution of the dinucleotides flanking SNPs was skewed 
and  long-tailed  because  of  a  few  over-represented 
sequences. The distribution of the trinucleotides flanking 
SNPs was also wide and long-tailed despite the narrow bell 
shape.  In  the  tetranucleotides  flanking  SNPs,  a  few 
sequences were highly biased. Thus, we concluded that 
the  long-tailed  distributions  suggest  the  effects  of  the 
flanking sequences on SNPs.

We suggest that three main factors are the cause of 
SNPs. Firstly, SNPs may occur in some regions where 
biological constraints are not in effect, to some extent. High 
polymorphism at microsatellite loci probably represents 
the fact that SNPs at some microsatellite loci may not be 
very harmful. Alu repeats are mobile genetic elements and 
to some degree, biological constraints probably do not 
affect Alu repeats. In this study, a few flanking sequences 
that have stem loop structures, and palindrome sequences 
such as TTGATTTTTT[A/T]AAAAAATCAA [dbSNP:rs4607190] 
were found even though it was not possible for statistical 
significance to be inferred. A SNP at the center of the 
palindrome may not significantly affect its structure.

Secondly, some sequences may cause a great deal of 
damage to certain nucleotides. It is plausible to think that 
biological constraints are the most important factor for SNP 
occurrence. However, at least in a statistical perspective, 
frequent DNA lesions in some regions can have effects on 
SNP occurrence in coding regions, and intron regions. We 
also applied Markov chains for the analysis of sequences 
in coding regions (data not shown). In both intron regions 
and coding regions, the greatest z values were positive. 
If biological constraints were the most important factor of 
SNP occurrence, the greatest z value would have been 
negative. The loss of proper hydrogen bonds by mismatches 
or unusual structures can be caused by microsatellites, 
palindromes, mirror repeats and A-tracts (McCarthy et al., 
1991). DNA slippage is probably the most frequent cause 
of DNA lesions. A surprising portion of the human genome 
consists  of  repetitive  DNA  sequences  such  as  short 
tandem repeat sequences. These mutate at a higher rate 
than the majority of DNA sequences (Asicioglu et al., 2004). 

Nucleotides  at  the  loops  of  palindrome  sequences 
probably have compromised hydrogen bonds. 

Thirdly, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to 
correct DNA lesions and noncanonical DNA structures 
may hinder some of these. However, some proteins can 
recognize  damaged  DNA  and  repair  it  effectively.  For 
example, human XPA and RPA probably recognize helical 
distortions in DNA (Vasquez et al., 2002). DNA damage 
may  affect  the  structure  of  the  double  helix,  and 
noncanonical structures are vulnerable to the effects of 
DNA damage. In in-del data, large in-dels are probably 
caused predominately by stem structure and H-DNA, as 
intramolecular hydrogen bonds induce stem structures 
(Kim, 1985) and hydrogen bonds in H-DNA induce triplex 
formation. Some large in-dels are also probably caused by 
long tandem repeats. In H-DNA, one half of the purine 
strand  enters  the  triplex  whereas  the  other  half  is 
unstructured and can form a duplex with the complementary 
oligonucleotide (Belotserkovskii et al., 1992). It is most likely 
that triplexesin mirror repeats, stem structures and large 
DNA slippage are the cause of large insertions or deletions. 
Naturally  occurring  H-DNA-forming  sequences  are 
mutagenic in mammalian cells and can induce large-scale 
deletion (Wang et al., 2004). However, the factors that 
cause SNPs are complicated, and require further research 
and experimental proofs. The future work for SNP data 
analysis will include challenges such as the development 
of  statistical  methods,  and  the  characterization  of  the 
interactions of SNP data.
