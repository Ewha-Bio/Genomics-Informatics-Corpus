In  this  issue,  diverse  topics  of  genome  biology  and 
informatics,  such  as  non-coding  RNAs,  biological  impli-
cation  of  introns,  transcriptome  sequencing,  disease- 
association  of  genetic  variants,  oncogenomics,  genetic 
evolution, and analysis of promoter regions are published. 
Drs. Yong Sun Lee and Xiaoyong Bao’s group (University of 
Texas)  reviewed  the  biogenesis  and  functions  of  tRNA- 
derived RNA Fragments (tRFs). tRFs is a newly introduced 
class of non-coding RNAs. Considering that tRFs are not 
random degradation products but are functional non-coding 
RNAs through specific tRNA cleavage, their review must be 
helpful  to  understand  this  emerging  class  of  non-coding 
RNA.  Dr.  Sun  Shim  Choi’s  group  (Kangwon  National 
University) raised interesting questions about intron. For 
examples,  why  only  eukaryotes  have  introns  or  why  the 
amount of total introns varies in different species and in 
different genes? In their review, they summarized previous 

researches about the functional roles or benefits of introns 
and suggest their view. Transcriptome sequencing is now one 
of the common and clinically applicable genome analyses 
tools.  In  this  issue,  Dr.  Sangwoo  Kim’s  group  (Yonsei 
University)  introduced  the  routine  workflow  of  trans-
criptome  sequencing  workflow  together  with  related 
software, focusing particularly on transcriptome reconstru-
ction and expression quantification. There are three papers 
regarding genetic evolution in diverse species. Dr. Kornsorn 
Srikulnath’s group (Kasetsart University) reviewed the role 
of  chromosome  changes  in  crocodilian  evolution  and 
diversity.  Dr.  Heebal  Kim’s  group  (Seoul  National  Uni-
versity) reported the genes related to positive selection in 
commercial pig breeds and also estimated the heritability in 
Holstein  breeding.  For  further  details,  please  visit  G&I
