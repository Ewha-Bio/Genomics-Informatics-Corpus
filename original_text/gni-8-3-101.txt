Abstract

During  the  last  decade,  large  community  cohorts  have 
been  established  by  the  Korea  National  Institutes  of 
Health  (KNIH),  and  enormous  epidemiological  and  clin-
ical  data  have  been  accumulated.  Using  these  in-
formation  and  samples  in  the  cohorts,  KNIH  set  out  to 
do  a 
large-scale  genome-wide  association  study 
(GWAS)  in  2007,  and  the  Korea  Association  REsource 
(KARE)  consortium  was  launched  to  analyze  the  data  to 
identify  the  underlying  genetic  risk  factors  of  diseases 
and  diverse  health  indexes,  such  as  blood  pressure, 
obesity,  bone  density,  and  blood  biochemical  traits.  The 
consortium  consisted  of  6  research  divisions,  formed  by 
25  principal  investigators  in  19  organizations,  including 
18  universities,  2  institutes,  and  1  company.  Each  divi-
sion  focused  on  one  of  the  following  subjects:  the  iden-
tification  of  genetic  factors,  the  statistical  analysis  of 
gene-gene  interactions,  the  genetic  epidemiology  of 
gene-environment  interactions,  copy  number  variation, 
the  bioinformatics  related  to  a  GWAS,  and  a  GWAS  of 
nutrigenomics.  In  this  special  issue,  the  study  results  of 
the  KARE  consortium  are  provided  as  9  articles.  We 
hope  that  this  special  issue  might  encourage  the  ge-
nomics  community  to  share  data  and  scientists,  including 
clinicians,  to  analyze  the  valuable  Korean  data  of  KARE.

netic  factors  as  well  as  environmental  factors.  However, 
each  single  genetic  effect  might  contribute  a  small  part 
to  the  phenotype.  Therefore,  large  sample  sizes  and  ge-
nome-wide  analysis  are  necessary  to  identify  multiple 
genetic  factors.  Since  2001,  the  Korea  National  Institute 
of  Health  (KNIH)  has  established  cohorts  nationwide  and 
accumulated  epidemiological  and  clinical  information  on 
a  large  scale,  up  to  300,000  subjects.  Using  these  sam-
ples,  KNIH  set  to  produce  genotype  data  in  2007  and 
proceeded  to  perform  a  genome-wide  association  study 
(GWAS).  In  order  to  make  the  most  of  the  massive  phe-
notype  and  genotype  data  set,  the  extramural  research 
consortium  was  organized  to  host  scientists  interested 
in  these  data.  The  Korea  Association  REsource  (KARE) 
consortium  consists  of  6  research  divisions,  formed  by 
25  principal  investigators  in  19  organizations,  including 
18  universities,  2  institutes,  and  1  company.  Each  divi-
sion  focused  on  one  of  following  subjects:  the  identi-
fication  of  genetic  factors,  the  statistical  analysis  of 
gene-gene  interactions,  the  genetic  epidemiology  of 
gene-environment  interactions,  copy  number  variation, 
bioinformatics  related  to  GWAS,  and  a  GWAS  of  nu-
trigenomics.
    In  this  issue,  9  papers  were  selected  from  the  consor-
tium.  Hong et al.  (2010)  investigated  the  feasibility  of  us-
ing  imputed  SNPs  for  a  GWAS  with  blood  pressure 
traits  to  determine  whether  they  could  improve  the  pre-
vious  results  that  were  analyzed  without  imputation  (Cho 
et al.,  2009).  Park et al.  (2010)  performed  a  GWAS  for 
blood  pressure  with  3  different  phenotype  models: 
young  hypertensive  cases  versus  elderly  normotensive 
controls,  the  upper  25%  versus  the  lower  25%  of  SBP 
distribution,  and  SBP  and  DBP  as  continuous  traits.  Kim 
et al.  (2010c)  conducted  a  GWAS  for  hematological  pa-
rameters  using  copy  number  variations.  Kwon  and  Kim 
(2010)  analyzed  a  GWAS  for  3  erythrocyte  traits,  such 
as  hemoglobin,  hematocrit,  and  red  blood  cells.  Doo 
and  Kim  (2010)  conducted  an  association  study  be-
tween  an  ADIPOQ  gene  SNP  (rs182052)  and  obesity  in 
Korean  women.  Kim  et  al.  (2010b)  compared  the 
Affymetrix  SNP  array  5.0  and  oligoarray  platforms  for 
defining  copy  number  variation.  Oh et al.  (2010)  applied 
a  joint  identification  approach  to  large-scale  GWA  data 
in  order  to  identify  genetic  variants  of  obesity  for  the 
Korean  population.  Kim  et al.  (2010a)  applied  a  struc-
tural  equation  model  to  a  GWAS  for  the  following  two 
purposes:  to  model  a  complex  relationship  between  a 
genetic  network  and  traits  as  risk  factors  and  to  achieve

a  better  understanding  of  the  biological  mechanism 
through  not  only  a  single  gene  but  also  many  genes  in-
volved  in  the  pathway  of  the  trait.  Kim  et al.  (2010d) 
conducted  targeted  resequencing  of  loci  identified  by 
the  KARE  GWAS  to  detect  potential  casual  and/or  rare 
variants  for  complex  traits,  such  as  type  2  diabetes  and 
triglycerides.
    During  the  last  2  years  of  the  consortium,  there  have 
been  more  than  15  meetings  and  gatherings  to  present 
and  discuss  results  of  the  KARE  data  analysis.  Up  to 
100  participants  were  involved  in  the  discussions,  estab-
lishing  a  new  paradigm  of  science  in  genomics  in  Korea. 
The  events  would  not  have  been  possible  had  KNIH  de-
cided  not  to  make  the  valuable  data  open  to  the 
consortium.  As  members  of  the  consortium,  we  appre-
ciate  the  members  of  the  Center  for  Genome  Science  in 
KNIH,  the  Ansung  and  Ansan  epidemiological  cohorts, 
and  DNALink  for  producing  and  managing  such  enor-
mous  and  valuable  resources.  Lastly,  we  hope  to  apply 
these  investigations  to  better  serve  the  health  of  the 
participants  in  the  cohorts.
