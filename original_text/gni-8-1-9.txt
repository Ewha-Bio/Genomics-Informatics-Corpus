Abstract

in 

involved 

Integrins  are  transmembrane  receptor  proteins  that  me-
diate  cell-cell  adhesion  and  cell-extracellular  matrix 
(ECM)  adhesion.  The  deregulation  of  cell-ECM  adhesion 
and  the  abnormal  expression  of  beta1  (β1)  integrins 
(ITGB1s)  are 
tumor  development  and 
metastasis.  In  the  liver,  the  expression  of  integrins  and 
ECM  proteins  can  be  a  cause  of  hepatocellular  carcino-
ma  (HCC)  development.  We  performed  direct  DNA  se-
quencing  of  24  individuals,  and  identified  23  sequence 
variants  of ITGB1  polymorphisms.  Among  these  23  var-
iants,  7  common  variants  were  selected  based  on  fre-
quencies  and  linkage  disequilibrium,  and  then  geno-
typed  in  a  larger-scale  group  of  subjects  (n=1,103).  The 
genetic  associations  of  ITGB1  polymorphisms  with  the 
clearance  of  HBV  and  HCC  outcome  of  HBV  patients 
were  analyzed  using  logistic  regression  models  and  Cox 
relative  hazard  models.  Although  there  was  no  sig-
nificant  association  observed  between 
the  poly-
morphisms  and  the  HCC  outcome  of  HBV  patients,  the 
second  most  common  haplotype  (ITGB1  haplotype-2 
[C-C-C-C-T-C-T])  was  putatively  associated  with  HBV 
clearance  (OR=0.75,  p=0.008  and Pcorr=0.05).  The  minor 
allele  frequency  (MAF)  of  ITGB1  haplotype-2  of  the 
spontaneously  recovered  (SR)  group  was  significantly 
higher  than  that  of  the  chronic  carrier  group  (CC)  (freq. 
=  0.248  vs.  0.199).  The  information  derived  from  this 
study  could  be  valuable  for  understanding  the  genetic 
factors  involved  in  the  clearance  of  HBV.

Introduction

The  hepatitis  B  virus  (HBV)  is  a  crucial  factor  in  bringing 
about  acute  and  chronic  liver  diseases  (Lin et al.,  2005). 
Approximately  350  million  people  are  chronically  in-
fected  with  HBV  all  over  the  world.  In  fact,  more  than 
1  million  HBV  carriers  die  annually  because  of  HBV-re-
lated  diseases  such  as  liver  cancer  (Chang et al.,  2005). 
Each  year,  nearly  50  million  cases  are  newly  diagnosed, 
and  out  of  that,  90%  of  the  affected  individuals  were  in-
fants  while  the  remaining  5∼10%  were  adults  (Merican 
et al.,  2000).  Continuous  HBV  infection  can  cause  liver 
cirrhosis  (LC)  and  hepatocellular  carcinoma  (HCC)  (Lin et 
al.,  2005).  HCC  is  the  most  widespread  and  severe  form 
of  malignancies  that  are  diagnosed  in  adults.  Patients 
infected  with  the  hepatitis  B  or  C  virus  are  more  likely 
to  develop  HCC,  which  in  turn  is  accompanied  by  liver 
cirrhosis.  The  progression  of  HCC  results  in  a  stepwise 
series  of  events.  Each  step  in  the  development  of  HCC 
appears  to  be  linked  to  separate  genetic  and  epigenetic 
aberrations.  These  changes  are  associated  with  alter-
ations  in  the  expression  or  formation  of  an  oncogene  or 
a  tumor  suppressor  gene  (Patil et al.,  2009).  In  addition, 
several  previous  studies  have  also  reported  associations 
between  genetic  polymorphisms  and  the  risk  of  HCC 
and/or  HBV  clearance,  e.g.,  histone  deacetylase-10 
(HDAC10)  and  secreted  phosphoprotein-1  (SPP1)  poly-
morphisms,  and  interleukin-10  (IL10)  haplotypes  were  al-
so  shown  to  be  associated  with  HBV  clearance  and/or 
HCC  development  (Lin  et al.,  2005;  Park  et al.,  2007; 
Shin  et al.,  2003;  Shin  et al.,  2007).
    Members  of  the  integrin  family,  the  beta1  (β1)  in-
tegrins  (ITGB1;  MIM#  135630)  are  heterodimeric  struc-
tures  consisting  of  a  common  β1  subunit  that  is 
non-covalently  associated  with  one  of  nine  different  α 
subunits.  These  molecules  are  widely  distributed  in  vari-
ous  cells  and  they  mediate  cell-cell  and  cell-ECM  inter-
actions  that  are  related  to  many  biological  functions  in 
the  development  of  cell  or  tissues,  hemostasis  and  im-
mune  response  (Garrido et al.,  2001).  It  has  been  shown 
that  the  deregulation  of  cell  adhesion  to  the  ECM  and 
the  abnormal  expression  of  ITGB1s,  particularly  the  α5
β1  down-regulation,  are  closely  associated  with  tumor 
development  and  metastasis.  Especially  in  the  liver,  the

infection  and  HCC  development 
(Lara-Pezzi  et al.,  2001;  Lee  et al.,  2009).
    Based  on  these  observations  in  the  area  of  tumor  and 
cancer  development,  we  hypothesized  that  the  poly-
morphisms  in  the ITGB1  gene  could  influence  the  clear-
ance  of  HBV  and  HCC  progression  among  HBV-infected 
patients.  We  performed  extensive  screening  of ITGB1  by 
direct  sequencing  to  detect  polymorphisms,  and  we  ex-
amined  their  genetic  associations  with  HBV  clearance 
and  HCC  progression.  Here,  we  report  23  genetic  poly-
morphisms  identified  in ITGB1  and  their  genetic  associ-
ations  with  HBV  clearance  and  HCC  progression  in  a 
Korean  population  (n=1,103).

Methods

Subjects  and  outcomes

A  total  of  1,103  Korean  subjects  having  either  present 
or  past  evidence  of  HBV  infection  were  prospectively 
extracted  from  the  outpatient  clinic  of  the  liver  unit  and 
from  the  Center  for  Health  Promotion  of  Seoul  National 
University  Hospital  from  January  2001  to  August  2003. 
These  subjects  were  divided  into  two  groups  according 
to  their  serologic  markers:  the  chronic  carrier  (CC)  group 
and  the  spontaneously  recovered  (SR)  group.  The  CC 
and  SR  groups  were  composed  of  670  and  433  sub-
jects,  respectively  (Table  1).  The  HBsAg-positive  patients 
(CC  group)  were  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)- 
positive  over  a  6-month  period.  They  were  followed  up 
for  disease  progression  at  least  every  6  months.  The  di-
agnoses  of  the  CC  and  SR  subjects  were  established 
by  repeated  seropositivity  of  the  hepatitis  B  surface  an-

had  other  types  of  liver  disease  such  as  autoimmune 
hepatitis,  toxic  hepatitis,  primary  biliary  cirrhosis,  or 
Budd-Chiari  syndrome  were  also  excluded  from  the 
sample.  None  of  the  patients  had  a  previous  history  of 
immunosuppression  or  anti-viral  treatment.
    Informed  consent  was  gained  from  each  patient,  and 
the  Institutional  Review  Board  of  Human  Research  at 
Seoul  National  University  Hospital  approved  the  study 
protocol.  Liver  cirrhosis  was  diagnosed  pathologically  or 
by  the  clinical  evidences  of  portal  hypertension  such  as 
visible  collateral  vessels  on  the  abdominal  wall,  esoph-
ageal  varices  on  the  esophagogastroscopy,  palpable 
splenomegaly,  and  sonographically  definite  findings  of 
cirrhotic  liver  or  ascites.  HCC  was  diagnosed  as  de-
scribed  previously  (Bruix  et al.,  2001).  The  clinical  pa-
rameters  are  summarized  in  Table  1.

Sequencing  analysis  of  ITGB1

Using  the  ABI  PRISM  3730  DNA  analyzer  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA),  we  sequenced  all  exons, 
including  exon-intron  boundaries  and  promoter  regions 
(∼1.5  kb),  to  discover  polymorphisms  of  the ITGB1  gene 
using  DNA  samples  of  24  unrelated  healthy  Korean 
individuals.  Twenty  seven  primer  sets  for  amplification 
(Supplementary  Table  1)  and  sequencing  analysis  were 
designed  based  on  GenBank  sequences  (NT_008705.15). 
Sequence  variants  were  verified  by  chromatograms.

Genotyping  with  fluorescence  polarization  de-
tection

In  order  to  genotype  the  polymorphic  sites  in  our  study, 
amplifying  primers  and  probes  were  designed 
for 
TaqMan  (Livak,  1999).  Primer  Express  (Applied  Biosys-
tems)  was  used  to  design  both  the  PCR  primers  and 
the  MGB  TaqMan  probes.  One  allelic  probe  was  labeled 
with  the  FAM  dye  and  the  other  with  the  fluorescent  VIC 
dye  (Supplementary  Table  2).  Typically,  PCR  was  run  in 
the  TaqMan  Universal  Master  mix  without  UNG  (Applied 
Biosystems)  at  a  primer  concentration  of  900  nM  and  a 

Genetic  Effects  of  ITGB1  Haplotype  in  HBV    11

TaqMan  MGB-probe  concentration  of  200  nM.  The  re-
action  was  performed  in  a  384-well  format  in  a  total  re-
action  volume  of  5  ul  using  20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The 
plate  was  then  placed  in  a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9700, 
Applied  Biosystems)  and  heated  for  2  min  at  50oC  and 
for  10  min  at  95oC,  followed  by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for 
15  s  and  60oC  for  1  min.  The  TaqMan  assay  plate  was 
then  transferred  to  a  Prism  7900HT  instrument  (Applied 
Biosystems)  where  the  fluorescence  intensity  of  each 
well  was  read.  Fluorescence  data  files  from  each  plate 
were  analyzed  by  automated  software  (SDS  2.1).  Primer 
sequences  are  listed  in  Supplementary  Table  1.

Statistical  analysis

Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  was  inferred  using  the  algo-
rithm  (Haploview)  that  searches  for  a  spine  of  strong 
|D’|  and  LD  coefficient  r2  running  from  one  marker  to 
another  (Barrett  et al.,  2005).  Haplotypes  of  each  in-
dividual  were  determined  using  the  algorithm  (PHASE, 
version  2.0)  developed  by  Stephens  et al  (Stephens  et 
al.,  2001).  Subjects  with  missing  genotypes  were  omit-

ted  in  the  analysis  of  individual  single-nucleotide  poly-
morphisms  (SNPs)  and  haplotypes.  The  genotyping  suc-
cess  rate  was  ＞ 99%,  which  makes  the  omission  of  a 
few  individuals  unlikely  to  change  the  results  of  the 
analysis.  For  analysis  of  viral  clearance  as  an  outcome, 
logistic  regression  models  were  used  for  calculating 
odds  ratios  (95%  confidential  interval)  and  correspond-
ing  p-values  controlling  for  age  (continuous  value)  and 
sex  (male=0,  female=1)  as  covariates.  Cox  models  were 
used  for  calculating  relative  hazards  and  P-values  con-
trolling  for  sex  and  status  of  liver  cirrhosis  among  the 
CC  group.
    The  effective  number  of  independent  marker  loci  in 
ITGB1  was  calculated  to  correct  for  multiple  testing,  us-
ing  the  software  SNPSpD  (http://genepi.qimr.edu.au/ 
general/daleN/SNPSpD/),  which  is  based  on  spectral  de-
composition  (SpD)  of  matrices  of  pair-wise  LD  between 
SNPs  (Nyholt,  2004).  The  resulting  number  of  in-
dependent  marker  loci  was  applied  to  check  for  multiple 
testing.  Statistical  powers  were  calculated  using  the 
software,  “Power  for  Genetic  Association  Analyses” 
(PGA)  (Menashe  et al.,  2008).  PGA  is  an  application

specifically  designed  to  calculate  statistical  power  and 
other  values  in  case-control  association  studies.  A 
co-dominant  (1df)  model  with  relative  risk  1.3,  disease 
prevalence  value  of  HBV  7.1%  (Lee et al.,  1998),  effec-
tive  degree  of  freedom  (EDF)  2,  and  an  alpha  error  level 
of  5%  was  used  to  calculate  the  statistical  power.

Results

Through  direct  sequencing  of  24  individuals,  we  identi-
fied  23  sequence  variants  in  the  ITGB1  gene:  4  in  the 
promoter  region,  7  in  coding  regions  of  exons,  11  in  in-
trons,  and  1  in  the  3’-untranslated  region  (3’-UTR)  (Fig. 
1A).  Pairwise  comparisons  of  all  23  polymorphisms  re-
vealed  two  sets  of  markers  in  absolute  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  (|D’|=1  and  r2=1,  Fig.  1A).  Among 
these  23  variants,  7  common  polymorphisms  (−401T＞
C, −170C＞A,  ＋5479A＞C,  ＋7377C＞T,  ＋9685T＞

C, ＋33920G＞T,  and ＋34701C＞T)  were  selected  for 
larger-scale  genotyping  (n=1,103)  based  on  location,  mi-
nor  allele  frequency  (MAF＞0.05),  and  LD.  No  significant 
deviations  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  (HWE)  were 
observed  (p＞0.05,  Table  2).  Five  major  haplotypes 
showed  frequencies  greater  than  0.05  and  accounted 
for  over  89.6%  of  the  distribution  (Fig.  1B).  Statistical 
powers  of  each  polymorphism  are  shown  in  Table  3.
    Association  analyses  of  HBV  clearance  (CC  vs.  SR) 
and  HCC  occurrence  (HCC  vs.  CH/LC)  for  each  poly-
morphism  and  haplotype  of  the  ITGB1  gene  were  per-
formed  using  logistic  regression  models,  controlling  for 
age  and  sex  as  covariates  (Table  3).  The  P-values  and 
odds  ratios  of  each  polymorphism  and  haplotype  are 
shown  in  Table  3.  Among  polymorphisms,  the  second 
most  common  haplotype  of  the  ITGB1  gene,  ITGB1 
haplotype-2 [C-C-C-C-T-C-T],  was  found  to  be  puta-
tively  associated  with  HBV  clearance,  i.e.,  the  frequency 
of  individuals  bearing  the  ITGB1  haplotype-2  allele 
among  the  SR  group  was  significantly  higher  than  those 
in  the  CC  group  (freq.=0.248  vs.  0.199,  OR=0.75, 
p=0.008, Pcorr=0.05).  Although  the  significances  were  not 
sociations  were  also  observed  in −401T＞C  (rs2504001) 
retained  after  correction  for  multiple  testing,  similar  as-

and ＋33920G＞T  (rs2153875).  There  was  no  associa-
tion  observed  between  ITGB1  polymorphisms  or  hap-
lotypes  and  HCC  occurrence  (Table  3).
    To  analyze  the  role  of  ITGB1  polymorphisms  in  the 
onset  age  of  HCC,  Cox  relative  hazards  analysis  for  age 
of  HCC  occurrence  was  performed  for  the  CC  group. 
No  significant  association  was  observed  (Table  3).

Discussion

Integrins  play  a  major  role  in  cell-cell  and  cell-ECM 

adhesion.  They  mediate  signaling  cascades  that  are  in-
volved  in  many  cell  functions.  Up-regulated  β integrins 
in  the  vascular  endothelium  function  as  angiogenesis  in-
hibitors  in  blood  vessels  of  some  human  tumors  (Bridger 
et al.,  2008;  Carlson  et al.,  2008).  The  abnormal  ex-
pression  of  β integrins  and  the  deregulation  of  cell- 
ECM  adhesion  can  be  causes  of  tumor  cell  develop-
ment,  growth,  and  metastasis.  Previous  studies  have 
suggested  that  the  down-regulation  of  integrin  α5β1  is 
associated  with  the  growth  of  tumor  cells  (Lara-Pezzi et 
al.,  2001;  Bridger et al.,  2008),  and  higher  expression  of 
β1  integrin  (ITGB1)  mRNA  is  significantly  associated 
with  docetaxel  resistance,  which  inhibits  the  effect  of 
chemotherapy  for  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
(Mori  et al.,  2008).  In  addition,  β integrins  have  key 
roles  in  the  primary  tumor  formation,  metastatic  dissem-
ination  and  inhibition  of  tumor  cell  senescence  in  mouse 
models  which  have  breast  and  pancreatic  cancer  (Streuli 
and  Akhtar,  2009). 
    In  this  study,  we  demonstrated  that  the  second  most 
common  haplotype,  ITGB1  haplotype-2  [C-C-C-C-T- 
C-T],  was  putatively  associated  with  HBV  clearance.  In 

addition,  there  were  association  signals  in −401T＞C 

(rs2504001) located in the promoter region and ＋33920G＞
T  (rs2153875)  in  intron  14,  although  significances  were 
not  retained  after  correction  for  multiple  testing.  If  the 
promoter  polymorphism  is  located  in  transcription  bind-
ing  sites,  it  can  induce  the  alteration  of  the  transcription 
factor  binding  and  affects  transcriptional  regulation. 
Previous  studies  demonstrated  the  associations  of  SNPs 
in  promoter  regions  with  HBV  infection  and/or  HCC 
occurrence.  First  of  all,  histone  deacetylase  10  (HDAC10) 
polymorphism  (HDAC10-589C>T)  was  associated  with 
the  clearance  of  HBV  infection  and  onset  age  of  HCC. 
The  promoter  activity  of  this  SNP  was  measured  by  lu-
ciferase  activity  reporter  assay.  The  functional  assay 
showed  that  luciferase  activity  of  “T”  allele  was  sig-
nificantly higher than that of  “C” allele of HDAC10-589C＞
T  (Park et al.,  2007).  Second,  interleukin-18  (IL-18)  poly-
morphism  (IL-18-148G＞C)  in  promoter  is  associated 
with 
risk  of  HCC.  The  promoter  activity  of 
IL-18-148G＞C  measured  by  luciferase  assay  revealed 

that −148C  allele  represses  transcriptional  activity  com-
pared  with  the −148G  allele  (Kim et al.,  2009).  In  addi-

the 

tion,  the  promoter  SNPs  of  tumor  necrosis  factor-α 
(TNF-α)  (TNF-α-863  and  TNF-α-308)  (Kim  et al., 
2003b)  and  transforming  growth  factor-  β1  (TGF- β1) 
(TGF-β1-509)  were  associated  with  HBV  clearance 
and/or  HCC  occurrence  (Kim  et al.,  2003a).
    The  involvements  of  β  integrin  polymorphisms  in 
HBV  infection  and  HCC  development  have  not  been  re-
ported  in  previous  studies.  However,  SNPs  in  other  fam-
ily  member  of  integrin  genes  showed  associations  with

Bold-face  indicates  SNPs  selected  for  larger-scale  genotyping.

HBV  and  HCC.  Integrin  αv  (ITGAV)  SNPs,  which  are  lo-
cated  in  introns  (rs9333289, rs11685758,  and rs2290083) 
and  3’-UTR  (rs1839123),  and  a  haplotype  (haplotype-1 
[C-C-G])  were  found  to  be  significantly  associated  with 
chronic  hepatitis  and  HBV-infected  HCC  in  a  Korean 

population  (Lee  et al.,  2009).  In  that  study,  rs9333289, 
rs11685758  and  rs1839123  were  associated  with  sus-
ceptibility  to  HBV-infected  HCC,  and rs2290083  was  as-
sociated  with  susceptibility  to  both  chronic  infection  of 
HBV  and  HBV-infected  HCC.  In  addition,  the  major  hap-

lotype,  haplotype-1 [C-C-G]  for  rs11685758-rs2290083- 
rs1839123,  was  associated  with  decreased  susceptibility 
to  chronic  infection  of  HBV  (OR=0.59,  95%  CI=0.36∼
0.97,  p=0.04)  and  HBV-infected  HCC  (OR=0.58,  95% 
CI=0.34∼0.98,  p=0.04).  In  comparison  with  our  study, 
the  association  between  haplotype-1 [C-C-G]  and  the 
decreased  susceptibility  to  chronic  HBV  infection  was 
similar  to  our  results  with ITGB1 haplotype-2 [C-C-C-C- 
T-C-T].  The  previous  study  may  be  less  reliable  than  our 
study  because  of  relatively  small  subjects  (n=304)  and 
p-values  which  did  not  undergo  multiple  testing  correc-
tions.  However,  in  spite  of  the  relatively  less  reliability, 
this  study  demonstrated  the  association  between  ITGAV 
polymorphisms  and  susceptibility  to  HBV  infection  (Lee 
et al.,  2009).  Therefore,  the  alpha  subunit  of  integrin, 
ITGAV  may  be  a  candidate  partner  for  the  beta  subunit 
of  integrin,  ITGB1  in  the  case  of  HBV  infection.
    Additional  studies  have  suggested  the  associations 
between  integrin  polymorphisms  in  introns  and  human 
diseases.  In  particular,  α4  and  α9  integrin  poly-
morphisms  (ITGA4  and ITGA9,  respectively)  were  shown 
to  be  associated  with  autism  and  nasopharyngeal  carci-
noma  (NPC),  respectively.  One  ITGA4  polymorphism  in 
intron  (rs155100)  showed  association  with  autism  in  a 
Portuguese  population,  and  eight  ITGA9  intron  poly-
morphisms  (rs169188,  rs197721,  rs149816,  rs169111, 
rs197770,  rs2212020,  rs189897,  and  rs197757)  were 
associated  with  NPC  in  a  Malaysian  Chinese  population 
(Correia  et al.,  2009;  Ng  et al.,  2009).  Similar  associa-
tions  between  integrin  polymorphisms  and  human  dis-
eases  in  various  European  populations  were  proposed 
by  another  study,  i.e.,  α4  integrin  polymorphisms 
(ITGA4)  (rs1449263  in  the  promoter  and  rs3770138  in 
an  intron)  were  significantly  associated  with  multiple 
sclerosis  (MS)  in  Basque  and  Nordic  populations  (The 
rs1449263  polymorphism  was  associated  with  MS  only 
in  the  Basque  population,  whereas  the  rs3770138  was 
associated  only  in  the  Nordic  population.)  (O'Doherty et 
al.,  2007).
    In  summary,  we  identified  23  genetic  variants  in  the 
human  ITGB1  gene.  Seven  common  polymorphic  sites 
were  selected  for  genotyping  in  our  HBV  cohort,  and 
statistical  analyses  showed  that  ITGB1  haplotype-2 
[C-C-C-C-T-C-T]  was  putatively  associated  with  HBV 
clearance.  Our  findings  will  provide  useful  information 
for  further  genetic  studies  of  this  important  gene.
