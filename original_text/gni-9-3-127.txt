Abstract

The  Epstein-Barr  virus-transformed  lymphoblastoid  cell 
line  (LCL)  is  one  of  the  major  genomic  resources  for  hu-
man  genetics  and  immunological  studies.  Use  of  LCLs 
is  currently  extended  to  pharmacogenetic  studies  to  in-
vestigate  variations  in  human  gene  expression  as  well 
as  drug  responses  between  individuals.  We  evaluated 
four  common  internal  controls  for  gene  expression  anal-
ysis  of  selected  hematopoietic  transcriptional  regulatory 
genes  between  B  cells  and  LCLs.  In  this  study,  the  ex-
pression  pattern  analyses  showed  that  TBP  (TATA 
box-binding  protein)  is  a  suitable  internal  control  for  nor-
malization,  whereas  GAPDH 
(glyceraldehyde-3-phos-
phate  dehydrogenase)  is  not  a  good  internal  control  for 
gene  expression  analyses  of  hematopoiesis-related 
genes  between  B  cells  and  LCLs  at  different  subculture 
passages.  Using  the  TBP  normalizer,  we  found  sig-
nificant  gene  expression  changes  in  selected  hema-
topoietic  transcriptional  regulatory  genes  (downregulat-
ion  of RUNX1, RUNX3, CBFB, TLE1,  and NOTCH2;  up-
regulation  of  MSC  and  PLAGL2)  between  B  cells  and 
LCLs  at  different  passage  numbers.  These  results  sug-
gest  that  these  hematopoietic  transcriptional  regulatory 
genes  are  potential  cellular  targets  of  EBV  infection, 
contributing  to  EBV-mediated  B-cell  transformation  and 
LCL  immortalization.

EBV-infected  B  cells  are  transformed  into  continuously 
proliferating  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines  (LCLs),  which  pro-
vide  genomic  resources  for  human  genetics  and  im-
munological  studies.  However,  there  is  a  limitation  of 
LCL  utilization,  due  to  possible  genetic  changes  in  the 
process  of  EBV  transformation  (Shukla  and  Dolan,  2005; 
Haas et al.,  2006).  It  is  controversial  that  LCLs  are  suit-
able  as  an  experimental  material  of  genomewide  associ-
ation  studies  (Simon-Sanchez et al.,  2007).  Nonetheless, 
the  use  of  LCLs  is  currently  extended  to  pharmacoge-
netic  studies  to  investigate  variations  in  human  gene  ex-
pression  as  well  as  drug  responses  between  individuals. 
For  example,  gene  expression  phenotypes  were  inves-
tigated  in  LCLs  for  the  relative  impact  of  nucleotide  and 
copy  number  variation  (Stranger  et al.,  2007).
    EBV  infection  induces  gene  expression  changes  in  B- 
cells,  contributing  to  immortalization.  A  number  of  cel-
lular  genes  have  been  identified  as  targets  of  EBV  in-
fection  in  various  systems,  including  inducible  and  sta-
ble  lymphoma  cell  lines  that  have  been  transfected  with 
particular  viral  gene  expression  vectors  or  infected  with 
EBV  (Carter  et al.,  2002;  Kelly  et al.,  2002;  Cahir- 
McFarland et al.,  2004;  Kang et al.,  2005).  For  gene  ex-
pression  analysis,  appropriate  internal  controls  should 
be  carefully  selected  to  normalize  the  expression  of  tar-
get  genes  in  LCLs.  Generally,  housekeeping  genes  are 
used  as  internal  controls  for  gene  expression  studies, 
assuming  that  such  genes  exhibit  relatively  constant  ba-
sal  levels  of  gene  expression  under  all  conditions.  How-
ever,  not  all  housekeeping  genes  are  always  applied  to 
the  normalization  of  gene  expression  data  under  all  con-
ditions  (Thellin  et al.,  1999).  It  has  been  reported  that 
the  comparison  of  target  gene  expression  needs  partic-
ular  internal  controls  that  are  suitable  in  different  tissues 
or  different  physiological  conditions  in  human  and  other 
organisms  (Selvey  et al.,  2001;  Vandesompele  et al., 
2002;  Lossos et al.,  2003;  Filby  and  Tyler,  2007;  Theis 
et al.,  2007;  Rho  et al.,  2010).  Among  housekeeping 
genes, GAPDH  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  a  good  in-
ternal  control  in  tumor  cell  lines  (Janssens et al.,  2004), 
while  HPRT  has  been  identified  as  a  good  reference 
gene  for  cancer  research  when  comparing  solid  tumor 
tissue  samples  with  normal  tissue  samples  (de  Kok  et 
al.,  2005;  Ohl et al.,  2005).  Thus,  it  is  recommended  that 
suitable  internal  controls  should  be  determined  for  accu-

rate  normalization  of  gene  expression  data. 
    For  peripheral  blood  cells  or  leukemia/lymphoma  cell 
lines, GAPDH  is  frequently  used  to  normalize  gene  ex-
pression  data  (Natkunam  et al.,  2005;  Saunders  et al., 
2005).  According  to  our  previous  microarray  data,  the 
choice  of  GAPDH  may  be  problematic  as  an  internal 
control  of  gene  expression  analysis  before  and  after 
EBV  infection.  In  addition,  as  the  use  of  LCLs  is  ex-
panded  to  various  areas  of  genomics,  including  phar-
amcogenomics,  gene  expression  analysis  of  LCLs  needs 
optimized  internal  controls.  Here,  we  evaluated  four 
common  internal  controls  for  gene  expression  analysis 
between  B  cells  and  LCLs,  applying  them  to  an  ex-
pression  analysis  of  selected  hematopoietic  transcrip-
tional  regulatory  genes. TBP  was  finally  selected  as  an 
optimal  internal  control  for  gene  expression  analysis  be-
tween  B  cells  and  LCLs. 

Methods

Cell  culture  and  sample  preparation

Peripheral  blood  was  obtained  from  the  Jungang  Blood 
Center  of  the  Korean  Red  Cross.  Ficoll-Hypaque  gra-
dient  centrifugation  was  performed  to  isolate  peripheral 
blood  mononuclear  cells  according  to  the  manufac-
turer’s  instructions  (Amersham).  Primary  CD19(+)  B  cells 
were  then  purified  by  negative  selection  using  a  B  cell 
isolation  kit  (Miltenyi  Biotech).  EBV  viral  stock  was  col-
lected  from  the  culture  of  an  EBV-transformed  B95-8 
marmoset  cell  line,  which  was  maintained  at  37oC  and 
5%  CO2  for  4∼7  days  and  then  stored  at  －80oC  until 
needed.  EBV  infection  of  primary  B  cells  and  LCL  gen-
eration  were  performed  as  described  elsewhere  (Hur et 
al.,  2005).  Briefly,  EBV-infected  B-cells  were  incubated 
in  RPMI-1640  supplemented  with  10%  FBS  and  pen-
icillin-streptomycin  (100μg/100  unit)  for  10∼20  days 
until  clumps  of  EBV-infected  B  cells  were  visible.  The 
culture  medium  was  then  changed  with  fresh  complete 
medium  for  subsequent  subculture.  When  cell  numbers 
of  EBV-infected  B-cells  reached  approximately  10  mil-
lion  cells  per  culture  flask,  the  cells  were  used  for  the 
next  passage  at  a  seeding  density  of  2∼5×105  cells/ 
ml.  At  this  point,  the  LCL  was  referred  as  passage  num-
ber  1.  Next,  the  LCL  culture  was  divided  for  continuous 
subculture  with  fresh  medium  approximately  twice  per 
week  and  maintained  to  passage  number  100.

Expression  analysis

Total  RNA  was  isolated  from  B-cells  and  counterpart 
LCLs  from  three  donors  using  Trizol  (Invitrogen)  and 
treated  with  DNase  I  prior  to  the  synthesis  of  first-strand 

cDNA  using  oligo  (dT)  primer  and  the  Superscript  II  re-
verse  transcription  kit  (Invitrogen).  Semi-quantitative  RT- 
PCR  was  performed  for  some  selected  genes.  Gene  ex-
pression  levels  of  some  selected  genes  were  estimated 
by  semiquantitative  RT-PCR  with  the  following  con-
ditions:  25  cycles  of  40  sec  at  94oC,  40  sec  at  60oC, 
and  100  sec  at  72oC  for RUNX3, MSC,  and GAPDH  and 
32  cycles  for  NOTCH2  and  TLE1. 
    For  quantitative  real-time  PCR,  amplification  mixtures 
(50  ul)  contained  10∼100  ng  of  first-strand  cDNA  tem-
plate,  25  ul  of  2×  SYBR  Green  Master  Mix  buffer  (Invi-
trogen),  and  600  nM  of  forward  and  reverse  primers 
(Table  1)  for:  control  genes  β-actin  (ACTB),  glycer-
aldehyde-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (GAPDH),  β2-mi-
croglobulin  (B2M),  and  TATA  box-binding  protein  (TBP); 
and  target  genes  pleiomorphic  adenoma  gene-like  2 
(PLAGL2),  musculin  (MSC)/activated  B-cell  factor  (ABF1), 
transducin-like  enhancer  of  split  1  (TLE1),  Notch  homo-
log  2  (NOTCH2),  Runt-related  transcription  factor  1 
(RUNX1),  Runt-related  transcription  factor  3  (RUNX3), 
and  core  binding  factor  beta  subunit  (CBFB).  PCR  cy-
cles  were  95oC  for  10  min,  followed  by  40  cycles  of 
95oC  for  15  sec,  and  60oC  for  1  min.  Reactions  were 
run  on  an  ABI  HT  7900  (Applied  Biosystems).  Relative 
expression  levels,  Δ(CTgene-CTcontrol),  were  displayed  as 
the  difference  in  CT  (threshold  cycle)  between  genes  of 
interest  and  internal  control  genes.

    For  the  correlation  coefficient  analysis  of  gene  ex-
pression  patterns,  expression  levels  of  particular  genes 
of  interest  were  normalized  to  four  different  reference 
genes.  Then,  correlation  coefficients  were  calculated 
from  the  expression  levels  (CT  values),  normalized  to 
pairs  of  reference  genes  (e.g., ACTB  vs TBP, ACTB  vs 

B2M, ACTB  vs GAPDH, TBP  vs B2M, TBP  vs GAPDH, 
B2M  vs  GAPDH).

able  internal  control  for  gene  expression  analysis  of  vari-
ous  types  of  LCLs,  we  evaluated  four  common  house-
keeping  genes  as  internal  control  genes.  First,  we  ex-
tracted  expression  data  on  ACTB,  TBP,  B2M,  and 
GAPDH  as  well  as  some  genes  of  interest  from  our  pre-
vious  microarray  data  (Baik et al.,  2007),  indicating  up-
regulation  of GAPDH  and ACTB  in  LCLs  compared  to  B 
cells.  However,  TBP  and  B2M  exhibited  less  than  a 
2-fold  change  between  B-cells  and  LCLs  (Table  2).  In 
addition,  with  regard  to  B  cell  transformation,  some 
genes  of  interest  were  randomly  selected  for  expression 
studies  of  hematopoiesis  and  lymphomagenesis-related 
genes.  Our  microarray  data  showed  that PLAGL2, MSC, 
TLE1,  RUNX1,  and  NOTCH2  exhibited  significant 
changes  in  gene  expression  levels  between  B-cells  and 
LCLs  (Table  2),  whereas  the  other  genes  (i.e.,  RUNX3, 
CBFB)  exhibited  less  than  a  2-fold  change.  For  these 
selected  genes,  RT-PCR  had  similar  gene  expression 
patterns  for  RUNX3,  MSC,  TLE1,  and  NOTCH2  as  the 
microarray  data  (Fig.  1). 
    Four  common  housekeeping  genes  were  included  in 
the  quantitative  real-time  PCR  of  hematopoietic  tran-
scriptional  regulatory  genes  so  that  relative  gene  ex-
pression  levels  could  be  obtained  by  normalization.  In  a 
comparison  of  gene  expression  only  between  B  cells 
and  early  passages  of  LCLs,  similar  patterns  in  hema-
topoietic  gene  expression  were  observed  when  normal-
ized  by TBP, ACTB,  and B2M  but  not  by GAPDH  (Fig. 
1B),  indicating  that  the  expression  pattern  of  GAPDH 
deviated  from  those  of  the  other  housekeeping  genes. 
This  result  suggested  that GAPDH  expression  might  be 
upregulated  in  EBV-infected  B  cells  during  LCL  gene-
ration.  Indeed,  GAPDH  upregulation  was  seen  in  LCLs 
of  different  passage  numbers  compared  with  B  cells 
when  normalized  by  TBP  (Fig.  1C). 
    Next,  expression  levels  of  hematopoietic  genes  were 
plotted  in  reference  to  each  internal  control  (Fig.  1C).  In 
a  comparison  of  expression  patterns  between  B  cells 
and  three  different  time  points  of  long-term  subcultures 

of  LCLs  (i.e.,  L1:  EBV-infected  B  cells,  L2:  early  passage 
LCLs,  L3:  late  passage  LCLs),  correlation  coefficients  of 
individual  expression  patterns  were  calculated  by  pair- 
wise  comparison  of  normalized  expression  levels  using 
four  different  internal  controls  (Table  3).  For  seven  genes 
that  were  tested,  TBP-normalized  expression  levels  of 
each  gene  were  correlated  with  ACTB-normalized  ex-
pression  levels,  whereas  the  worst  correlation  coeffi-
cients  of  normalization  between GAPDH  and B2M  were 
seen.  This  result  suggested  that TBP  or ACTB  might  be 
a  suitable  internal  control  for  gene  expression  analyses 
of  hematopoiesis-related  genes  in  various  subculture 
passages  of  LCLs.  However,  our  previous  microarray 
data  showed  that  ACTB  was  upregulated  by  about  4- 
fold  in  LCLs  compared  with  B  cells  (Baik  et al,  2007). 
Therefore, TBP  was  finally  selected  as  an  internal  con-
trol  for  further  gene  expression  analysis  of  hemato-
poietic  transcriptional  regulatory  genes  of  interest.   
    Next,  the  optimized  internal  control, TBP,  was  applied 
to  the  gene  expression  analysis  of  seven  randomly  se-
lected  hematopoietic  transcriptional  regulatory  genes  in 
LCLs.  Real-time  PCR  results  showed  that  gene  ex-
pression  levels  of  MSC,  TLE1,  RUNX1,  PLAGL2,  and 
GAPDH  changed  dramatically  between  B  cells  and 
LCLs,  whereas  those  of  RUNX3  and  CBFB  changed 
slightly  after  EBV  infection  (Fig.  1C).  Interestingly,  the 
upregulation  or  downregulation  patterns  that  were  de-
tected  in  EBV-infected  cells  were  sustained  until  the 
middle  passage  number  (100)  of  LCLs.  Thus,  these  re-
sults  suggest  that  dysregulation  of  these  selected  hema-
topoietic  genes  may  contribute  to  EBV-mediated  B  cell 
transformation  and  LCL  immortalization. 

Discussion

Gene  expression  studies  of  EBV-transformed  LCLs  have 
commonly  used GAPDH  or ACTB  as  internal  controls  for 
normalization  (Baran-Marszak  et al.,  2002).  In  our  pre-
vious  study,  global  gene  expression  patterns  between  B

cells  and  LCLs  were  obtained  from  our  microarray  anal-
ysis,  in  which  GAPDH  was  used  as  an  internal  control 
for  validation  of  gene  expression  (Baik  et al.,  2007).  In 
general,  internal  control  genes  need  relatively  constant 
basal  levels  of  gene  expression  in  experimental  condi-
tions.  However,  our  microarray  data  suggested  that 
some  housekeeping  genes  might  be  dysregulated  be-
tween  B  cells  and  LCLs.  Therefore,  we  evaluated  four 
common  housekeeping  genes  as  suitable  internal  con-
trols  for  the  normalization  of  mRNA  expression  and  ap-
plied  them  to  a  gene  expression  study  of  potential  cel-
lular  target  genes  of  EBV  infection.  Our  results  showed 
that  the  transcriptional  level  of GAPDH  increased  in  the 
process  of  EBV-mediated  B-cell  transformation.  The  up-
regulation  of GAPDH  might  be  involved  in  B-cell  repro-
gramming  during  LCL  generation.  Alternatively,  GAPDH 
might  be  a  direct  cellular  target  gene  of  EBV  infection. 
Generally,  the  expression  of  B  cell-specific  genes  is  lost, 
and  B  lineage-inappropriate  genes  are  upregulated  dur-
ing  malignant  transformation  of  lymphoid  cells,  suggest-
ing  B-cell  reprogramming  during  EBV-mediated  B-cell 
transformation  (Janz  et al.,  2006).  Therefore,  GAPDH 
may  not  be  suitable  for  internal  controls  in  gene  ex-
pression  analyses  between  B-cells  and  LCLs.  Further-
more,  a  correlation  coefficient  analysis  for  gene  expres-
sion  profiles,  normalized  by  four  housekeeping  genes, 
showed  that  TBP  was  found  to  be  a  suitable  internal 
control  in  the  gene  expression  analysis  between  B  cells 
and  LCLs.  Moreover, TBP  expression  level  was  found  to 
be  moderately  abundant  in  B  cells  and  LCLs,  as  de-
termined  by  the  CT  difference  between  genes  of  interest 
and  TBP  (Fig.  1B).  Although  many  other  housekeeping 
genes  were  not  evaluated  in  this  study,  at  least  TBP 
can  be  used  as  an  optimum  internal  control  for  gene 
expression  analysis,  regardless  of  the  status  of  B-cells 
(e.g.,  primary,  EBV-infected  B-cells)  or  long-term  sub-
culture  of  LCLs.  Thus,  we  finally  selected TBP  as  a  nor-
malizer  for  further  gene  expression  studies  of  hema-
topoietic  transcriptional  regulatory  genes.
    It  is  known  that  the  hematopoietic  genes  that  were 
selected  for  this  study  are  involved  in  hematopoiesis 
and  lymphoid  malignancies.  For  example,  PLAGL2,  a 
developmentally  regulated  C2H2  zinc  finger  on  chromo-
some  8q12,  is  the  main  target  for  pleomorphic  ad-
enomas  of  the  salivary  gland.  Recently,  it  was  reported 
that PLAGL2 induced  acute  myeloid  leukemia  in  cooper-
ation  with CBFB-MYH11  in  mice  (Landrette et al.,  2005). 
Our  results  showed  that  PLAGL2 was  upregulated  in 
EBV-infected  B-cells  and  LCLs,  suggesting  that PLAGL2 
may  be  a  potential  target  of  EBV-mediated  B-cell  trans-
formation.  On  the  other  hand,  RUNX  family  members 
are  heterodimeric  transcription  factors  composed  of  an 
α subunit,  RUNX,  and  a  β subunit,  CBFβ.  Of  the 

Expression  Analysis  and  Internal  Control  in  LCLs    131

three  members  of  the  RUNX  family, RUNX1  is  known  as 
a  master  regulatory  gene  of  hematopoiesis.  According 
to  the  literature, RUNX3  was  identified  as  a  cellular  tar-
get  of EBNA-2  in  the  inducible  cell  line  (Spender et al., 
2002).  The  distal  P1  promoter  of  RUNX1  controls  ex-
pression  of  the RUNX1c  isoform,  while  the  proximal  P2 
promoter  expresses  RUNX1a  (AML-1a)  and  RUNX1b 
(AML-1b)  (Miyoshi et al.,  1991). RUNX3  represses  tran-
scription  from  the RUNX1  P1  promoter,  indicating  tran-
scriptional  crossregulation  of  RUNX1  by  RUNX3  in  hu-
man  B  cells  (Spender et al.,  2005).  On  the  contrary,  our 
PCR  results  showed  that RUNX1  expression  was  down-
regulated  in  parallel  with  slight  downregulation  of RUNX3 
between  B  cells  and  LCLs,  which  is  inconsistent  with  a 
previous  report  of  crossregulation  by  RUNX3.  This  dis-
crepancy  might  be  due  to  a  different  PCR  target  of 
RUNX1  isoforms,  because  the  RUNX  isoform  that  we 
examined  in  our  study  was  the  RUNX1  P2  transcript 
rather  than  RUNX1  P1  transcripts.  Musculin  (activated 
B-cell  factor-1,  MSC)  is  a  basic  helix-loop-helix  tran-
scription  factor,  and  its  expression  is  restricted  to  a 
subset  of  lymphoid  tissues,  lymphoblastoid  cell  lines, 
and  activated  human  B  cells.  MSC  (ABF-1)  expression 
is  restricted  to  a  subset  of  lymphoid  tissues,  lympho-
blastoid  cell  lines,  and  activated  human  B  cells  (Massari 
et al.,  1998),  suggesting  that MSC  is  a  downstream  tar-
get  of  the  B-cell  receptor  signal  transduction  pathway. 
With  respect  to  cell  growth,  EBV  infection  mimics  B-cell 
activation  signals  or  factors,  such  as  CD40-CD40L,  IgM, 
and  LPS,  so  that  EBV-infected  B-cells  exhibit  greater 
proliferation  than  resting  B-cells  (Kilger  et al.,  1998). 
Thus,  the  upregulation  of  MSC  in  LCLs  might  be  re-
sponsible  for  greater  proliferative  activity  in  EBV-infected 
B-cells  compared  with  B-cells.  TLE  (transducin-like  en-
hancer  of  split)  genes  are  human  homologs  of  the Dro-
sophila  groucho  gene.  TLE1  binds  to  the  Runt  domain 
and  the  C  terminus  of RUNX1  to  inhibit RUNX1-induced 
transactivation  of  the CSF1  (colony  stimulating  factor  1) 
receptor.  Our  PCR  analysis  showed  that  TLE1  and 
NOTCH2  were  downregulated  in  LCLs  compared  with 
B-cells,  suggesting  that  Notch  signaling  may  be  in-
volved  in  EBV-mediated  B-cell  transformation.  Taken  to-
gether,  our  results  suggest  that  the  hematopoietic  tran-
scriptional  regulatory  genes  that  were  tested  in  this 
study  may  be  potential  cellular  targets  of  EBV  infection 
during  LCL  generation. 
    In  conclusion,  we  evaluated  four  common  internal 
controls  for  a  gene  expression  analysis  between  B  cells 
and  LCLs  and  found TBP  as  a  suitable  internal  control. 
Expression  analysis  using  a TBP  normalizer  allowed  us 
to  identify  dramatic  changes  in  selected  hematopoietic 
transcriptional 
(downregulation  of 
RUNX1, RUNX3, CBFB, TLE1,  and  NOTCH2;  upregula-

tion  of  MSC  and  PLAGL2)  during  EBV-mediated  B-cell 
transformation  and  LCLs  at  different  passages.  There-
fore,  these  genes  may  be  potential  cellular  targets  of 
EBV  infection  and  potential  reference  biomarkers  of  LCL 
generation.
