Protein  phosphorylation  at  tyrosine  residues  is  a  key 
regulatory  event  that  modulates  insulin  signal  trans-
duction.  We  studied  the  PTPN1  gene  with  regard  to 
susceptibility  to  Korean  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM) 
and  its  related  quantitative  traits.  A  total  of  seven  SNPs 
[g.36171G＞A 
(rs3787343), 
g.58208A＞G 
(rs754118), 
g.69560C＞G  (rs6020612),  g.69866G＞A  (rs718050),  and 
g.69934T＞G  (rs3787343)]  were  selected  based  on  fre-
quency  (＞0.05),  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  status,  and 
haplotype  tagging  status.  We  studied  the  seven  SNPs  in 
483  unrelated  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  (age: 
64±2.8  years,  onset  age:  56±8.1  years;  206  men,  277 
women)  and  1138  nondiabetic  control  subjects  (age: 
64±2.9;  516  men,  622  women).  The  SNP  rs941798  had 
protective  effects  against  T2DM  with  an  odds  ratio  of 
0.726  (C.I.  0.541∼0.975)  and  p-value=0.034,  but  none 
of  the  remaining  six  SNPs  was  associated  with  T2DM. 
Also,  rs941798  was  associated  with  blood  pressure,

been  associated  with  T2DM  in  previous  reports  of 
Caucasian-American  and  Hispanic-American  popula-
tions.  This  is  the  first  report  that  shows  an  association 
between  PTPN1  and  T2DM  in  the  Korean  as  well  as 
Asian  population.

Introduction

Protein  phosphorylation  at  tyrosine  residues  modulates 
intracellular  signaling  pathways,  and  this  modulation  is 
an  essential  determinant  of  insulin  signal  transduction 
(Goldstein et al.,  1998;  Evans  and  Jallal,  1999).  Protein 
tyrosine  phosphatase  1B  protein  (PTP1B),  encoded  by 
the PTPN1  gene,  regulates  the  tyrosine  phosphorylation 
of  insulin  receptor  (Seely  et al.,  1996)  and  insulin  re-
ceptor  substrate  1  (Goldstein et al.,  2000),  which  leads 
to  downregulation  of  insulin  signaling. PTPN1  deficiency 
in  mice  results  in  increased  insulin  sensitivity  (Elchebly 
et al.,  1999)  and  enables  normalization  of  blood  glucose 
levels  (Klaman  et al.,  2000).  Moreover,  it  has  been 
shown  that  inactivation  with  antisense  oligonucleotides 
regulates  the  expression  of  genes  that  are  involved  in 
lipogenesis,  such  as  SREBF1,  suggesting  that  PTP1B 
may  play  a  role  in  the  enlargement  of  adipocyte  energy 
storage  (Rondinone  et al.,  2002).
    The  human  PTPN1  gene  maps 
to  chromosome 
20q13.13,  a  syntenic  region  of  the  distal  arm  of  mouse 
chromosome  2  that  harbors  quantitative  trait  loci  for 
body  fat  and  body  weight  (Lembertas et al.,  1997).  The 
PTPB1  gene  consists  of  10  exons,  spanning  74  kb,  and 
the  first  intron  is  longer  than  50  kb.  In  humans,  several 
linkage  signals  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM) 
(Bowden et al.,  1997),  BMI  (Hunt et al.,  2001),  fat  mass, 
and  energetic  intake  (Collaku  et al.,  2004;  Dong  et al., 
2003;  Lembertas et al.,  1997)  were  reported  at  this  lo-
cus  in  different  populations,  further  supporting  the  can-
didacy  of  PTPN1  involvement  in  T2DM  and  obesity.  In 
Poland,  a  family-based  linkage  study  of  T2DM  showed 
the  highest  logarithm  of  the  odds  score  (Ji et al.,  1997; 
Klupa et al.,  2000).  This  locus  also  showed  evidence  of 
linkage  with  early  onset  T2DM  (onset=45  years)  in  a 
subset  of  55  French  families  (Zouali  et al.,  1997).

    Since  the  discovery  of  the PTPN1  gene  (Forsell et al., 
2000),  multiple  studies  have  attempted  to  examine  its 
role  in  susceptibility  to  T2DM.  A  missense  variant  in  the 
coding  region  of  PTPN1  was  found  to  be  associated 
with  T2DM  and  glucose  tolerance  in  the  Danish  pop-
ulation  (Echwald  et al.,  2002),  and  an  insertion/deletion 
polymorphism  in  the  3’-untranslated  region  was  asso-
ciated  with  insulin  resistance  (Di  Paola et al.,  2002).  In 
an  extensive  analysis  of  the  PTPN1  gene  locus,  Bento 
et al.  (2004)  observed  associations  between  multiple 
SNPs  and  T2DM 
independent  Caucasian- 
American  case-control  samples.  The  evidence  for  asso-
ciation  was  most  consistent  for  SNPs  in  the  region  that 
spanned  the  3’-end  of  intron  1  to  the  last,  intron  8.  All 
of  the  associated  SNPs  lay  in  a  single  haplotype  block, 
and  one  common  haplotype  (frequency=36%)  was  found 
to  be  strongly  associated  with  T2DM.  The  same  group 
evaluated  and  confirmed  previous  findings  of  SNPs  and 
haplotypes  of  PTPN1  for  association  with  quantitative 
glycemic  traits  in  Hispanic-American  subjects  from  the 
Insulin  Resistance  Atherosclerosis  Study  Family  Study 
(IRASFS)  (Palmer  et  al.,  2004).  However,  a  recent 
meta-analysis  that  included  7883  individuals  from  three 
large  European  case-control  samples  (from  the  US, 
Poland,  and  Scandinavia)  did  not  replicate  this  associa-
tion  for  any  single  SNP  or  haplotype  (Florez  et al., 
2005).  A  conclusion  of  the  association  between PTPN1 
and  T2DM  in  Asian  and  African  populations  is  needed.
    Despite  the  inconsistency  of  the  association  with 
T2DM,  the  evidence  that PTPN1  might  be  a  significant 
contributor  to  genetic  susceptibility  to  T2DM  seems  to 
be  strong.  Because  no  study  of  PTPN1  in  association 
with  T2DM  in  the  Asian  population  has  been  presented, 
we  provide  the  first  report  of  the  susceptibility  of  the 
PTPN1  gene  in  Korean  T2DM  and  its  related  quantita-
tive  traits. 

Methods

Subjects

The  24  DNA  samples  from  Korean  subjects  that  were 
used  for  the  initial  sequencing  were  randomly  selected 
from  unrelated  local  residents  with  no  history  of  familial 
diseases.  With  24  samples  (48  chromosomes),  it  might 
be  expected  that  more  than  90%  of  SNPs  have  a  fre-
quency  that  is  greater  than  0.05  (Eberle  and  Kruglyak, 
2000).  We  studied  483  unrelated  patients  with  type  2 
diabetes  (age:  64±2.8  years,  onset  age:  56±8.1  years; 
206  men,  277  women)  and  1138  nondiabetic  control 
subjects  (age:  64±2.9;  516  men,  622  women).  All  sub-
jects  who  enrolled  in  this  study  originated  from  the 
Ansung-Ansan  prospective  community  cohort.

    In  this  study,  diabetic  subjects  were  recruited  accord-
ing  to  American  Diabetes  Association  criteria  from 
10,038  individuals  in  the  Ansung-Ansan  prospective 
community  cohort.  Nondiabetic  subjects  who  had  no 
history  of  diabetes,  no  first-degree  relatives  with  dia-
betes,  fasting  plasma  glucose  levels  less  than  6.1 
mmol/L,  and  hemoglobin  A1c  (HbA1c)  levels  less  than 
5.8%  were  recruited  from  the  cohort.  To  be  eligible, 
normal  control  subjects  also  had  to  be  free  of  medi-
cations  for  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  dyslipidemia. 
The  study  was  approved  by  the  institutional  review 
board  of  the  Korean  National  Institute  of  Health.  Written 
informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all  subjects. 

Measurement  of  clinical  characteristics

Both  T2DM  and  normal  control  subjects  were  aged  60 
years  and  older.  The  clinical  characteristics  of  the  sub-
jects  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  All  study  subjects  were 
examined  in  the  morning  after  an  overnight  fast  and  60 
min  and  120  min  after  an  oral  glucose  tolerance  test 
(OGTT).  The  parameters  that  were  measured  were 
height,  weight,  body  mass  index  [BMI:  weight  (kg)/ 
square  of  height  (m2)],  waist  and  hip  circumference, 
waist-to-hip  ratio  (WHR:  waist/hip),  and  blood  pressure. 
Blood  samples  were  drawn  for  biochemical  measure-
ments:  fasting  plasma  glucose  (GLU0),  OGTT  60  min 
and  120  min  plasma  glucose  (GLU60  and  GLU120,  re-
spectively),  fasting  plasma  insulin  (INS0),  OGTT  60  min 
and  120  min  plasma  insulin  (INS60  and  INS120,  re-
spectively),  HbA1c,  total  cholesterol  (TCHL),  triglycerides 
(TG),  and  high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDL). 
Using  the  measurements,  low-density  lipoprotein  choles-
terol  [LDL:  TCHL-TG-(HDL/5)],  area  under  glucose  curve 
(AUCGLU),  area  under  insulin  curve  (AUCINS),  homeo-
stasis  model  assessment  of  insulin  resistance  [HOMA- 
IR:  GLU0*INS0/(22.5*14.182)],  quantitative  insulin  sensi-
tivity  check  index  [QUICKI:  1/(log(GLU0)＋log(INS0)],  and 
insulin  sensitivity 
(ISI)  were  calculated.  The 
QUICKI  was  derived  using  the  inverse  of  the  sum  of  the 
logarithms  of  the  fasting  insulin  and  fasting  glucose 
levels.  This  index  correlates  well  with  glucose  clamp 
studies  (r=0.78)  and  is  useful  for  measuring  insulin  sen-
sitivity  (IS),  which  is  the  inverse  of  insulin  resistance  (IR) 
(Katz  et al.,  2000).

Sequencing  analysis  of  the  human  PTPN1  gene

We  sequenced  all  exons,  including  exon-intron  bounda-
ries  and  the  promoter  region  (approximately  1.5  kb),  to 
discover  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  24 
DNA  samples  from  Koreans  using  the  ABI  PRISM  3730 
DNA  analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA, 

PTPN1  Gene  Association  with  Korean  T2DM    101

USA).  Sixteen  primer  sets  for  the  amplification  and  se-
quencing  analysis  were  designed  based  on  GenBank 
sequences  (Ref.  Genome  seq.  NT_011362  released  on 
February  19,  2004).  Information  regarding  primers  is 
available  on  our  website  (http://www.ngri.re.kr/SNP/). 
Sequence  variants  were  verified  by  chromatograms.

Genotyping

the 

Among 
identified  polymorphisms,  seven  SNPs 
(g.36171G＞A,  g.58166G＞A,  58208A＞G,  g.64840C＞T, 
g.69560C＞G,  g.69866G＞A,  and  g.69934T＞G)  were 
selected  based  on  frequency  (＞0.05),  linkage  dis-
equilibrium  (LD)  status,  and  haplotype  tagging  status.  In 
addition,  one  indel  (g.1484G_ins)  was  selected  based  on 
previous  reports  (Bento  et al.,  2004;  Burdon  et al., 
2006).
    SNPs  were  genotyped  using  amplifying  primers  and 
probes  designed  for  TaqMan  (Livak,  1999).  Primer 
Express  (Applied  Biosystems)  was  used  to  design  both 
the  PCR  primers  and  the  MGB  TaqMan  probes.  One  al-
lelic  probe  was  labeled  with  the  FAM  dye,  and  the  other 

was  labeled  with  the  fluorescent  VIC  dye.  PCRs  were 
run  in  TaqMan  Universal  Master  mix  without  UNG 
(Applied  Biosystems)  and  with  PCR  primer  concen-
trations  of  900  nM  and  TaqMan  MGB  probe  at  a  con-
centration  of  200  nM.  Reactions  were  performed  in 
384-well  format  in  a  total  reaction  volume  of  5μl  using 
20  ng  of  genomic  DNA.  The  plates  were  then  placed  in 
a  thermal  cycler  (PE  9700,  Applied  Biosystems)  and 
heated  at  50oC  for  2  min  and  95oC  for  10  min,  followed 
by  40  cycles  of  95oC  for  15  s  and  60oC  for  1  min,  with 
a  final  soak  at  25oC.  The  TaqMan  assay  plates  were 
transferred  from  the  thermal  cyclers  to  a  real-time  PCR 
system  (Prism  7900HT,  Applied  Biosystems)  that  read 
the  fluorescence  intensity  of  each  well  of  the  plate. 
Fluorescence  data  files  from  each  plate  were  analyzed 
using  automated  software  (SDS  ver.  2.1,  Applied  Biosy-
stems).

pared  by  student  t-test  for  all  variables,  except  sex, 
which  was  compared  by  the  chi  square  test.  Deviation 
of  genotype  frequency  from  the  expected  Hardy-Wein-
berg  equilibrium  was  examined  with  the  chi  square  test. 
To  approximate  a  normal  distribution,  TG,  INS  0,  INS60, 
INS120,  AUCINS,  HOMA-IR,  QUICKI,  ISI,  and  MALB_U 
were  log-transformed  before  analysis.  We  examined 
linkage  disequilibrium  (D’)  and  generated  a  plot  for  the 
PTPN1  gene  using  Haploview  v3.2  (http://broad.mit.edu/ 
haploview/)  (Barrett  et al.,  2005).  Haplotypes  were  in-
ferred  using  Haploview.  Differences  in  genotype  frequen-
cies  between  T2DM  patients  and  controls  were  com-
pared  using  the  chi  square  test,  and  the  mode  of  in-
heritance  was  analyzed  by  a  logistic  regression  pro-
cedure.  Genotypes  were  given  codes  of  0,  1  and  2;  0, 
1  and  1;  0,  0  and  1  in  the  additive,  dominant,  and  re-
cessive  models,  respectively.  The  associations  between 
SNPs  or  haplotypes  and  T2DM-related  subphenotypes 
were  determined  by  linear  regression  analysis  while  con-
trolling  for  age,  sex,  and  BMI  among  normal  control 
subjects.  The  SAS  statistical  software  package  (SAS 
Institute  Inc.  Cary,  NC,  USA)  was  used  to  perform  gen-
eral  statistical  analyses.  Statistical  significance  was  de-
termined  at  a  two-tailed  value  of  p＜0.05. 

Korean  SNP  database 

Information  on  most  of  the  SNPs  that  are  described  in 
this  study  is  available  in  the  Korean  SNP  database 
(http://www.ngri.re.kr/SNP/),  which  was  constructed  at 
the  Center  for  Genome  Sciences  (Korean  National 
Institute  of  Health).

Results

Most  of  the  variables  that  are  shown  in  Table  1  were 
significantly  higher  in  T2DM  patients  than  normal  con-
trols,  but  HDL  cholesterol  and  INS60  [insulin  level  at  1 
hour  after  oral  glucose  tolerance  test  (OGTT)]  were  low-

    Through  direct  sequencing  of  all  exons  and  their 
boundaries  in  the  PTPN1  gene,  including  up  to  -1500 
bp  of  the  5’-flanking  region,  19  SNPs  were  identified 
(Table  2).  The  genomic  positions  of  the  SNPs  are  illus-
trated  in  Fig.  1A.  The  SNPs  that  were  selected  for  fur-
ther  study  are  in  bold  and  with  an  asterisk  (*);  they  had 
more  than  a  5%  allele  frequency  and  a  tagging  of  the

Discussion

In  this  study,  we  investigated  the  effect  of  seven PTPN1 
SNPs  on  susceptibility  to  T2DM  and  its  related  quantita-
tive  traits  in  a  Korean  Ansung-Ansan  prospective  com-
munity  cohort.  Our  T2DM  association  results  are  similar 
to  those  that  were  found  for  the  Caucasian-American 
population  (Bento  et al.,  2004)  and  Hispanic-American 
population  (Palmer  et  al.,  2004)  but  differ  from  a 
European  study  (Florez et al.,  2005),  which  did  not  find 
any  significant  associations  even  though  they  obtained 
the  same  haplotype  block.
    A  total  of  five  SNPs  consisting  of  haplotype  2  (Fig. 
1C)  showed  a  significant  association  with  QUICKI.  Two 
(rs941798  and  rs3787348)  of  the  five  SNPs  also  were 
associated  with  ISI.  The  results  imply  that  the  associa-
tion  between PTPN1  and  T2DM  may  be  caused  by  in-
sulin  resistance.  Although  the  association  with  QUICKI 
was  significant,  the  differences  between  genotypes  were 
not  clear.  However,  the  ISI  was  decreased  in  individuals 
who  had  at  least  one  minor  allele.  This  result  is  well 

these 

results 

imply 

the  SNP 

supported  by  a  previous  report  (Palmer  et al.,  2004). 
    The  association  between  the PTPN1  gene  and  blood 
pressure  was  greatly  in  concordance  with  previous  two 
reports  (Cheyssac  et al.,  2006;  Spencer-Jones  et al., 
2005).  Both  reports  suggested  that PTPN1  gene  variants 
increase  blood  pressure.  Moreover,  our  results  showed 
a  more  significant  increase  in  systolic  blood  pressure  in 
homozygotes  of 
rs718050  minor  allele. 
Although PTPN1  is  an  important  regulator  of  the  insulin 
signaling  pathway, 
that  SNP 
rs718050  may  be  a  useful  marker  to  predict  hyperten-
sion.
    We  also  identified  the  increased  tendency  of  TG  in 
homozygotes  of  rs6020612;  the  minor  allele  homo-
zygotes  were  observed  in  only  two  individuals.  Although 
this  association  was  reported  in  other  reports  (Cheyssac 
et al.,  2006;  Spencer-Jones et al.,  2005),  the  associated 
SNP  had  a  higher  frequency  of  minor  allele  homozy-
gotes.  Therefore,  the  association  between  PTPN1  and 
TG  should  be  confirmed  using  other  SNPs  that  have 
been  previously  reported.
    PTP1B  also  inhibits  leptin  signaling  through  the  de-
phosphorylation  of  JAK2  and  STAT3  (Zabolotny  et al., 
2002;  Cheng et al.,  2002).  Moreover,  it  was  shown  that 
inactivation  with  antisense  oligonucleotides  regulates  the

expression  of  genes  that  are  involved  in  lipogenesis, 
such  as  SREBF1,  suggesting  that  PTP1B  may  play  a 
role  in  the  enlargement  of  adipocyte  energy  storage 
(Rondinone  et al.,  2002).  Two  SNPs  (rs941798  and 
rs3787348)  effected  decreased  HDL  cholesterol  levels  in 
minor  allele  homozygotes.  This  result  also  has  been  re-
plicated  in  another  report  (Cheyssac  et al.,  2006),  but 
the  previous  report  showed  a  marginal  association, 
while  our  results  revealed  lower  p-values  (rs941794 
p=0.002,  and  rs3787348  p=0.003).  Both  SNPs  showed  a 
significant  association  with  blood  pressure,  implying  that 
the  increased  blood  pressure  might  result  in  low  HDL 
cholesterol  levels  and  be  related  to  lipid  metabolism, 

which  is  another  molecular  pathway  of PTPN1  function 
(Santaniemi  et al.,  2004).
    This  is  the  first  report  that  shows  the  association  be-
tween PTPN1  and  T2DM  in  the  Korean  as  well  as  Asian 
population.  We  hope  this  study  will  increase  our  knowl-
edge  about  T2DM  pathophysiology.
