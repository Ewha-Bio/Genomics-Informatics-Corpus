Abstract 

Integrated genomics refers to the use  of  large-scale, 
systematically  collected  data  from  various  sources 
to  address  biological  and  biomedical  problems.  A 
critical  ingredient to a successful  research  program 
in  integrated  genomics  is  the  establishment  of  an 
effective computational  infrastructure.  In  this review, 
we  suggest  that  the  computational  infrastructure 
challenges include developing tools for  heterogeneous 
data organization and  access,  innovating techniques 
for combining  the  results  of  different  analyses,  and 
establishing  a  theoretical  framework for  integrating 
biological  and  quantitative  models.  For  each  of  the 
three areas - data integration,  analyses  integration, 
and  model  integration- we  review some  of  the  current 
progress and  suggest  new topics of  research.  We  argue 
that  the  primary  computational  challenges  lie  in 
developing  sound 
for 
understanding  the  genome  rather  than  simply  the 
development  of  algorithms  and  programs.

Introduction 
The  era  of  genomics  was  brought  into  prominence  with 
the  initiation  of  the  Human  Genome  Project  in  October 
of  1990.  The  Human  Genome  Project  was  declared 
complete  in  April  2003  after  13  years  of  international  effort 
(Collins,  Morgan,  and  Patrinos,  2003).  Many  other  genome 
projects  have  been  completed  with  more  than  100 
(non-viral)  whole  genomes  already available and  many 
more  genomes  in  the  pipeline.  Current  sequencing

capacity  is  such  that  a  relatively  medium-sized  genome 
like  that  of  Drosophila pseudoobscura can  be  completed 
by  a  single  company,  essentially  in  one  month.  As 
genomic  sequencing  has  become  routine,  attention  has 
begun  to  focus  on  so-called  post-genomic technologies 
including  large-scale transcript  assays,  proteomics, 
combinatorial  chemistry,  and  so  on  (with  an  unfortunate 
accompanying  proliferation  of  neologisms  including: 
transcriptome,  proteome,  metabolome,  etc.).  It  is  too 
premature to  put  strong  emphasis  on  any  particular 
sub-field  such  as  "proteomics"  or  "functional  genomics" 
but  it  is  clear  all  of  these  activities  involve  an  important 
principle:  large-scale,  high-throughput,  systematic 
collection  of  data  without  explicit  predefined  hypotheses. 
In  this  review,  we  will  refer  to  all  such  activities  "genomic 
sciences"  or  "genomic  approaches." 

As  mentioned,  genomic approaches  to  biological 
problems  involve the  idea  of  systematic  data  collection 
at  all  levels  of  information,  including  the  genome,  the 
state  of  the  cell  (e.g.,  the  transcriptome,  the  proteome, 
the  metabolome,  etc.),  and  the  phenotype  (e.g.,  anatomy, 
physiology,  clinical,  etc.).  Genomic  approaches  have 
several  important  advantages.  First,  they  leverage 
high-throughput 
technologies  and  streamlined 
production  processes  to  obtain  data  at  a far  higher speed 
and  lower  expense  than  is  possible  through  individual 
experimentation.  Second,  by generating  a large  collection 
of  data  and  making  it  publicly available,  they allow  the 
research  community  access  to  resources  that  are  relevant 
to  the  original  problem  as  well  as  to  many  innovative 
and  unanticipated  problems.  Most  importantly,  the 
availability of  large-scale systematic  data  allows  for  new 
kinds  of  inferences and  discoveries that  can  be  only 
made  when  the  entire  data  is  available.  For  example, 
in  recent  years,  genomic technologies  have  been 
increasingly  used  to  address  human  disease specific 
problems  such  as  typing  hidden  variation  in  human 
cancer  (e.g.,  Alizadeh  eta/.,  2000;  West  eta!.,  2001), 
tracking  infectious  disease agents  and  hosts  (e.g., 
Metzker  eta/.,  2002;  Hillis,  2000),  discovering  new  drug 
targets  (e.g.,  Foth  eta!.,  2003;  Kissinger  eta/.,  2002), 
discovering  new  genes  and  molecular  processes 
involved  in  diseases,  and  many  other  innovative 
applications. 

The  profusion  of  various  large-scale  data  has  led  to 
the  coining  of  the  phrase  "Integrated  Genomics."  This 
phrase,  as  used  in  various  literatures,  is  associated  with 
a  vague  (but  exciting)  hope  that,  given  large  quantities 

8  Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  2(1)  7-18,  March  2004 

of  genome-scale data  collected  at  different  levels of 
biological  organization  and  from  a  variety of  organisms, 
we  should  be able to  utilize  all  this  information  in  a 
comprehensive  manner. 

The  grand  answer to  such  a challenge  "here  is  a way 
that  anybody asking  any  biological  question  can  bring 
all  evidence to  bear"  is  obviously  impossible and  really 
speaks  to how science  is  carried  out in  general.  However, 
from  a  computational  viewpoint,  we  might  envision  an 
integrated  computing  environment  for  genome-scale 
modeling  in  which  a scientist would  be able  to  describe 
a  hypothesis to  be  tested  as  a  precise  combination  of 
model  components.  Each  specification  would  be 
computable and  would  be coupled  with  appropriate  data 
sources  to  score  the  hypothesis.  The  computable 
components  would  be  modular  such  that  different  ideas 
or  data  expressed  as  these  modules  could  be 
interchangeably  combined  to  construct  a  grand 
computable  hypothesis and  test  of  hypothesis.  For 
example,  one  should  be  able  to  specify  various 
hypotheses  about  signal  transduction  pathways,  which 
in  turn  could  be  used  to  compute  a  genome-wide 
expression  pattern,  this  expression  pattern  serving  as 
input  into a  model  relating  the  expression  pattern  to 
phenotypic  data. 

This,  of  course,  is  a  rather  lofty goal  given  that  so 
many of the  biological  and  computational  questions 
relevant  to  building  such  a system  are  still  unanswered. 
Rather  than  focusing  on  the  details of  what  such  a system 
might  look  like,  we  instead  focus  our  discussion  on  a 
number of  "integrative  principles" that  might  be employed 
as  we  work towards  such  a goal.  At  the  most  basic  level 
we  need  tools  and  systems  for  Data Integration including 
signal  processing  of  the  primary data (e.g.,  microarray 
measurements),  statistical  characterization  (e.g.,  image 
analysis from  radiological  measurements,  text  mining), 
and  organiZation  (e.g.,  integrated  databases).  At  the  next 
level  we  need Anal}sis lntegralion wherein  we  can  employ 
a  multitude  of  analysis tools for  biological  inference  but 
in  such  a way that  different  analyses  and/or their  outputs 
can  be  combired.  Finally,  we  need  tools  and  systems 
for  Mode/Integration.  Ideally,  the  various  analysis  tools 
should  incorporate  biological  process  models as their 
principles.  Similarly,  their outputs should  either  explicitly 
or  implicitly suggest  new  biological  process  models  (e.g., 
an  estimate  of  gene  regulatory  network should  then 
translate  into  a  new  model  of  molecular  interactions and 
pathways).  These  models  then  should  be combinable 
either  in  their output  states  or  as  principles for  analyses. 
For  example,  two  different  models  for  a gene family,  say 
one  based  on  a Hidden  Markov  Model  and  another  based 
on  secondary  structure,  should  be combinable  for 

function  prediction. 

The  goal  of  this  review  is  to  explore  some  of  the 
computational  challenges  within  each  of these three  areas 
that  must  be  met  if  we  are to  practice  a truly  integrative 
genomics.  In  particular,  we  discuss  our  vision  of  the 
principles and  accompanying  computational  framework 
that  would  allow  for  a  theoretically  sound,  uniform 
approach  to  integrated  genomic analyses.  In  addition 
to  discussing  these  integrative  principles,  we  highlight 
current  research  and  future  challenges for  establishing 
a computational  infrastructure  to  meet  the  demands of 
integrated  large-scale  data  analysis. 

Data  Integration 
The  ultimate  goal  of  data  integration  in  bioinformatics 
is  to  provide analysis  tools  with  unified access  to  the 
great  variety of  large-scale data.  As  mentioned  in  the 
introduction,  there  are  three  classes  of  problems  that 
need  to  be  solved  by a computational  system  for  data 
integration.  The  first  class  of  problems  is  what  we  might 
call  "instrumentation  problems." These  are computational 
problems associated  with  obtaining  the  most  accurate 
and  efficient  measurements  from  organisms.  The  second 
class  of  problems  might  be called  "data  characterization 
problems." These  problems  involve transforming  and 
encapsulating  primary  data  in  an  organized  and 
comparable  manner.  For  example,  taking  functional  MRI 
data and  identifying  morphological  landmarks  in  such 
a  way  to  make  different  individual  measurements 
comparable  is  a  data characterization  problem  (e.g., 
Kennedy  eta!.,  2002).  The  third  class  of  problems  is 
the  more familiar  problem  of  establishing  a  database 
system  for  easy  access  to  heterogeneous  data. 

Data  Acquisition 
The  main  tradeoff  in  many  high-throughput technologies 
is  that  between  volume  of  data and  accuracy of  data. 
Some  high-throughput technologies  such  as  standard 
multiplexed  sequencing  have  been  sufficiently 
standardized  such  that  there  is  no  real  tradeoff  between 
data volume  and  data  quality.  However,  for  the  majority 
of  newer  technologies  such  as  transcript  assays, 
proteomics,  microarray  biochemistry,  and  sequencing 
by  hybridization,  obtaining  reliable  instrumentation  is  still 
a  large  challenge.  An  example  of  this  is the  computations 
required  to  obtain  reliable  microarray gene  expression 
measurements.  For  eDNA type of  arrays,  many  different 
methods  have  been  presented  for  correcting  for 
array-to-array standardization,  dye/channel  bias, 
robotic  pin  bias,  and  so on  (e.g.,  Kerr  and  Churchill, 
2001;  Yang  et at.,  2002).  In  practice,  all  of  these  factors 

Computational  Challenges  for  Integrative  Genomics  9 

play a great  role  in  the  array  measurements;  yet  there 
are  still  significant  sources  of  error  and  there  is  a  need 
to  develop  new  computational  tools  especially with 
respect  to  noise  reduction  and  feature  recognition  at  the 
primary  image  level  (e.g.,  de-trend  analysis).  Similar 
problems arise  for  20  protein  gels  as  well  as  for  primary 
signal  processing  from  a  mass  spectroscopy  instrument 
(Efrat  eta!.,  2002).  As  a  third  example,  detection  of 
genomic alteration  by  array  Comparative  Genomic 
Hybridization  (aCGH)  is  quickly  becoming  an  essential 
tool  for  cancer  biology.  However,  there  are  many 
computational  and  statistical  challenges  associated  with 
aCGH,  such  as  reliable  copy  number  determination  and 
extrapolation  of  the  clone  data  to  genomic  regions 
(Mantripragada  eta!.,  2004;  Wang  and  Guo,  2004). 
It  is  expected  that  many  of  these  problems  will  be 
solved  soon  with  a  combination  of  better  physical 
instruments and  algorithms.  For  example,  the  early 
automated  sequencers  also  had  many  instrumentation 
problems  with  both  the  device  itself  and  the  algorithms 
that  interpreted  the  spectra.  However,  there  is  also  another 
important  family  of  problems  that  require  more  research, 
namely computational  support for  developing  new 
high-throughput technologies.  For  example,  Sequencing 
By  Hybridization  (SBH)  is  an  important  strategy  for 
reaching  the  next  level  of  efficiency  in  genomics  (Ben-Dar 
eta/.,  2001).  The  design  of  a  proper  set  of  oligomers 
that  will  minimize  cross  hybridizations  and  allow efficient 
assembly  is  still  an  unresolved  problem.  In  particular, 
many  of  the  current  approaches  do  not  seem  to  take 
into account that  much  of  the  genome  consists  of  related 
gene families  or  related  sequence  pieces.  This  kind  of 
computational  support  for  data  acquisition  is  a  weakly 
developed  area  that  is  likely to  be  critical  for  continued 
development  of  genomic technologies.  Another  case 
example  can  be  found  in  computational  support  for 
phenotyping.  Ultimately,  the  real  interest  in  genomic 
approaches  is  in  associating  the  rapidly  obtained 
genomics  data  to  phenotypic  predictions  such  as  risk 
for  cancer  recurrence.  High-throughput  phenotyping, 
especially at the  anatomical  level,  is  a huge bottleneck 
in  allowing  sufficient  data  collection.  Image  analysis, 
image  reconstruction,  and  image-based  signal 
processing  are all  expected  to  be  important  areas  of 
computational  development  (Yarrow  eta/.,  2003)  in  this 
context. 

Data  Characterization  and  Encapsulation 
In  information  processing  theory,  a  distinction  is  made 
between  "data"  and  "information",  where  data  refers  to 
the  primary  measurements  (after  correction  for 
instrumentation  problems)  and  information  refers  to  a 

transformation  of  the  data  into  an  organized  structure 
that  can  be  used  for  higher  level  inferences  (so-called 
"knowledge").  A canonical  problem  in  transforming  data 
to  information  is  processing  of  text  found  in  scientific 
literature.  From  the  computational  point  of  view,  the  text 
is  unstructured  data  that  must  be  organized  into 
specifically typed  information.  For  example,  we  may  be 
interested  in  collecting  information  to  construct  an  overall 
view  of  Drosophila development.  Each  primary  text  must 
be  mined  for  gene  names,  mutations,  possible  phenotypic 
effects,  possible  gene interactions,  and  so  on.  The  steps 
involved  are:  (1)  developing  annotation  standards and 
software  tools  for  annotating  training  documents  with 
respect  their  syntactic  structure  and  semantic  content 
(especially  tied  to  specific  domain  knowledge,  say 
Drosophila development);  (2)  curating  a  training  set 
following  the  syntactic  rules;  and  (3)  developing 
algorithms  for  automatic  training  of  components  that  will 
recognize  the  relevant  syntactic  and  semantic  structures 
accurately  in  new  documents.  In  many  ways,  these 
problems  point  to  a  model  driven  (or  more  generically, 
knowledge  driven)  characterization  of  the  primary  data. 
That  is,  to  determine  the  important  components  of  a journal 
article,  we  already  need  some  model  of  the  knowledge 
ontology.  We  can  analogize  this  to  similar  ideas  in 
mathematical  statistics  where  the  idea  of  a  "sufficient 
statistic"  is  to  obtain  a function  of  the  data  that  is  sufficient 
to  characterize  some  probability distribution  (i.e.,  a model). 
In  other  words,  data  characterization 
involves 
transformation  and  reduction  of  data  to  the  most  relevant 
bits  of  biological  information.  But,  we  cannot  determine 
what  is  most  relevant  without  a  prior  knowledge  model. 
Using  programming  jargon  we  might  call  this  process 
of  transforming  and  extracting  primary  data  to  a 
representation  that  provides  sufficient  and  efficient 
information  vis-a-vis some  prior  model  (or  even  a vaguely 
determined  set  of  prior  models),  data encapsulation.  We 
want  our  data  encapsulated  in  such  a  way  that  only 
the  interface  necessary  for  knowledge  modeling  in  any 
particular  domain  is  exposed.  An  important  aspect  of 
encapsulation 
is  what  we  might  call  "context 
independence".  Given  some  primary  measurements,  we 
would  like to  extract  information  that  is  as  context 
independent  as  possible.  For  example,  one  might 
consider  expression  microarray  normalization  as  a 
process  of  making  the  measurement  values  context 
independent of  particular  arrays.  The  act  of  attaching 
functional  annotation  to  a  particular  subsequence  of  the 
genome,  say  calling  it  an  exon,  is  also  an  act  that  makes 
a  particular  stretch  of  sequence acquire  a  context 
independent  property,  namely  that  of  an  exon. 

A  dual  notion  to  making  data  context  independent  is 

10  Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  2(1)  7-18,  March  2004 

making  data  "comparable".  By  this  we  mean  charac(cid:173)
terizing  the data  in  such  a  way  that  the  representation 
in  one  measurement  is  comparable  to  another 
measurement.  A  concrete  example of  this  is  sequence 
alignment  of  multiple  genomic  strings.  Sequence 
alignment  makes the  positions  comparable  (positional 
homology)  such  that  we  can  compute quantities  like 
distances  between  the two  strings.  The  alignments also 
provide  context  independence for  individual  nucleotides 
in  the sense that  we  can  commonly  discuss  particular 
nucleotides  independent of  their context  within  each 
string.  We  return  to a discussion  of  context  independence 
and  comparability  in  the  section  on  Model  Integration. 
As  mentioned  previously,  phenotyping  is an  important 
COfl1JCll19l1l:  d  integrative genomics.  A relatively straightfaward 
phenotyping  problem  is  the  characterization  of  anatomical 
image  data.  Here  we  first  have  the  challenge  of 
encapsulating  a  large amount  of  information,  i.e.,  pixels, 
in  a  biologically  relevant  manner.  Suppose  the  data  of 
interest  are  images  of  the  brain.  Our  prior  knowledge 
model  includes the  general  geometry of  the  brain  (oval 
3D  structure)  and  information  about  gross anatomy.  This 
knowledge  must  be  used  to  segment  the  image 
(encapsulate  the  data)  into  relevant  anatomical  regions. 
Given  such  segmentation  we  would  next  want  to  allow 
comparison  between  different  brain  images (sampled 
from  different  individuals or at  different times),  which  might 
require  isolating  homologous  landmarks,  coordinatizing 
the  landmarks,  and  transforming  different coordinates 
from  different  images  into a  common  system  (Bookstein, 
1991).  Many  phenotypic data  characterization  problems 
are  even  more complex.  For  example,  in  neurogenomics 
we  are  interested  in  genomic basis  of complex  phenotypes 
some of  which  may  be  only  measured  through  behavioral 
assays  such  as  memory,  navigation,  conditioning,  and 
so on.  In  these  cases,  the  very  basic  representation  of 
data  is  a  challenge.  Many of  these  problems  are  similar 
to  challenges  that  are  found  in  systematics  and  taxonomy. 
Taking  advantage of  the  many  methods and  ideas that 
have  been  developed  in  these  literatures  will  aid  greatly 
in  our  task of  moving  towards  an  integrative genomics. 

Data  Management  and  Accessibility 

The  last  class  of  problems  in  data  integration  is  the  more 
common  problem  of  establishing  databases  and 
connecting  heterogeneous  data  sources.  While  there  has 
been  great  progress  in  databases for  genomics,  this  area 
continues to  remain  a  major  challenge  (Stein,  2003).  Much 
of  the  information  associated  with  the  Human  Genome 
Project  (HGP)  and  similar  projects on  other organisms 
is  served  through  controlled  Web  interfaces  rather  than 
by  direct  access to  conventional  databases.  Many 

difficulties arise  from  a  lack of  coordinated  vocabularies. 
Recent  efforts  on  developing  ontologies  will  certainly  help 
with  this  problem  (Ashburner  eta/.,  2000;  Harris  et a/., 
2004).  A serious  challenge  is  to  enable  biologists  to cope 
with  frequent  changes  of  assumptions,  experimental 
hypotheses,  and  techniques;  biological  data sources  are 
often  loosely coupled  with  voluntary  quality and  standards 
control  and  not  uncommon  introduction  of  completely 
novel  data types.  The traditional  data  integration  scenario 
starts with  the  local schemas  of  several  actual  data 
sources and  one  global schema  against  which  queries 
are asked.  In  the  warehousing approach  a  database 
corresponding  to  the  global  schema  is  built.  Warehousing, 
and  more  generally building  derived  value-added 
databases,  is  an  important aspect  of  the  landscape of 
biological  data.  For  example,  the  GUS  (Genomics  Unified 
Schema)  developed  at  the  University of  Pennsylvania 
is a warehousing  scheme designed  to  integrate  biological 
sequences,  annotations,  gene  expression,  gene 
regulation,  and  proteomics  under the  central  dogma of 
biology:  Genes  to  RNA  to  Protein  (Davidson  eta/.,  2001). 
An  important  principle  here  is  that  by modeling  the  data 
scheme around  the  most  invariant central  theory for  the 
types  of  data,  we are able to  derive consistent  schema 
for  heterogeneous  data.  By  itself  warehousing  is  not  a 
satisfactory solution  in  the  integration  scenarios we 
consider  here  because there  is  too  much  volatility and 
need  for  flexibility  (Stein,  2003).  What  is  required  is  a 
set  of  approaches  that  promote peer data integration, 
where  there  is  no global  schema  but  a  mapping  between 
various  different  data  schema.  An  especially  important 
challenge for  peer  data  integration  is  tools  for  dealing 
with  data  redundancy (Deutsch and  Tannen,  2003) and 
semi-automatically discovering  data  relations  by schema 
matching  and  mapping  (Rahm  and  Bernstein,  2001). 

Analysis  Integration 
The  motivating  observation  behind  analysis  integration 
is  that  biological  phenomena  are  commonly context 
dependent and  any single  inference  based  on  marginal 
measurements  tends to  be weak with  both  large false 
positives  and  false  negatives.  For  example,  in  Kim  et 
a/.  (2000)  we  developed  an  algorithm  for  predicting  novel 
multi-transmembrane  proteins.  However,  application  of 
this  algorithm  to  genomic  data  can  result  in  10%  of  the 
potential  genes scoring  positive,  which  would  translate 
into thousands  of  genes for  the  Drosophila  genome. 
Overcoming  problems  like  this  requires  incorporating 
additional  types  of  analyses  such  as clustering  candidates 
into gene  families,  considering  codon  usage,  negative 
selection  against  known  databases,  and  so on.  Ideally, 

Computational  Challenges  for  Integrative  Genomics  11 

integration  of  all  of  these  separate  procedures  should 
be  as  seamless  as  possible. 

In  order to  achieve  such  seamless  integration  between 
different  methods  our  analytical  tools  need  to  meet  at 
least three  criteria.  First,  the  output  of  different  analyses 
must  be  compatible  in  the  sense  that  they  must  allow 
conjunction  of  the  results.  Where  existing  software tools 
do not  provide  for  easy  conjunctions,  translators  must 
be  designed  to  make  the  output  of  various algorithms 
compatible.  For  example,  the  output  of  two  different 
programs  for  exon  prediction  could  be  either 
sub-sequences or categorical  labels  (e.g.,  yes/no)  over 
the  (partially)  shared  input  set.  Thus  the  outputs  can 
be combined  because  the  programs  share  the  same 
type of  output  or  because  they  share  the  same  type 
of  inputs  and  the  outputs  are functions  over the  input 
types.  Second,  there  must  be  a  value  scheme  for 
quantifying  the  reliability  of  each  output,  such  as 
probabilities,  ranks,  scores,  and  so  on.  Finally,  there  must 
be a way of  computing  a  reasonable  function  (say,  some 
calculus)  of  combined  value  schemes  in  order  to 
characterize  the  acceptability of  given  hypotheses  under 
combined  analyses.  The  last  two  components  allow  us 
to  combine  heterogeneous  algorithm/analyses  results. 
The  most  natural  approach  is  to  adopt  a  probabilistic 
interpretation  of  the  value  scheme,  which  will  allows  us 
to  use  existing  machinery from  probability theory for  the 
value  calculus. 

We  note  that  combining  inference from  different 
analyses  requires  the  consideration  of  interactions of 
different  biologically-based  analysis  schemes,  not  just 
some  algorithmic  scheme  for  combining  analyses.  For 
example,  given  a difficult  optimization  problem  such  as 
the  maximum  likelihood  phylogeny  estimation  (cf, 
Felsenstein,  2003)  one  might  create  a  strategy  of 
combining  the  results  of  various  heuristic algorithms. 
However,  this  is  different  from  the  problem  of  maximizing 
the  probability  of  obtaining  the  correct  phylogeny,  which 
might  be  best  approached  by  analyzing  different  data 
sources  as  well  as  incorporating  any  constraints  from 
prior  biological  knowledge.  Thus,  any  value  scheme 
attached  to  the  results  should  be  based  on  some 
reasonable  principle of  relating  the  output  to the  biological 
goal,  and  not  just  on  algorithmic  considerations. 

Designing  value  schemes 

Two  of  the  most  important  ways  in  which  values  could 
be  assigned  to  outputs  are  the  following: 

1)  A stochastic  model  is  chosen  for  the  process  producing 
the  input  data.  The  value  associated  with  an  output 
is  then  the  probability that  the  particular  output  is 

produced.  For  example,  in  a  pairwise  alignment 
problem,  we  could  define an  underlying  stochastic 
process  that  transforms  an  unknown  common  string 
into the  two  given  strings  (or,  equivalently,  one  of  the 
given  strings  into  the  other)  with  specific  rates  of 
insertions,  deletions  and  substitutions.  The  value  or 
score  associated  with  an  alignment  would  then  be 
the  probability  that  the  alignment  represents  a 
homology  of  the  process.  Actual  alignment  scoring 
schemes  in  use  do correspond,  modulo  some  cosmetic 
translation,  to  this  process view.  As  another  example, 
in  phylogeny estimation  a stochastic  model  such  as 
the  Jukes-Cantor  model  or the  Kimura  2-parameter 
model  is  chosen  (Felsenstein,  2003).  The  likelihood 
of  a particular  tree topology with  particular  edge  lengths 
is  proportional  to  the  probability that  this  choice  would 
produce the  observed  data  (assuming  that  the  prior 
probabilities  are  uniform). 

2)  The  value  associated  with  an  output  is  its  significance, 
i.e.,  the  (un)likelihood  of  observing  this  output  pattern 
in  a  suitable  null  model.  The  null  model  for  DNA 
sequences  could  be  sequences  generated  as  i.i.d. 
random  variables,  sequences  sampled  uniformly from 
a  language  generated  by a suitably defined  grammar, 
sequences  produced  by  simulating  a  suitable 
evolutionary  process  (if  the  evolutionary  relationship 
between  the  taxa  is  understood),  etc.  For  other  objects 
such  as  RNA  or  protein  secondary  structures 
appropriate  null  models  have  to  be  defined  based 
on  the  context. 

We  review  some  examples  of  model-based  and 

null-hypothesis  based  value  schemes  below. 

Model-based  value  schemes 

Bioinformatics  algorithms  need  to  embody  more  explicit 
generative  models  of  the  data  if  their  results  are to  be 
integrated  following  sound  probabilistic  principles.  One 
example  of  where  this  has  already  been  done  is  the 
use  of  hidden  Markov  models  (HMMs)  for  biological 
sequence  modeling  and  alignment  (Durbin  et at.,  1998). 
Heuristic  alignment  programs  like  BLAST  can  be  seen 
as  approximations  of  the  more  expensive  full  dynamic 
programming  algorithms  used  with  HMMs.  However, 
HMMs  in  their  basic  form  do  not  constitute  a sufficiently 
flexible  structure for  analysis  combination.  Fortunately, 
HMMs  are  members  of  the  broader  class  of  probabilistic 
graphical  models  (Lauritzen,  1996)  that  includes  Bayes' 
nets,  Markov  random  fields,  and  (under  appropriate 
interpretation)  probabilistic  grammars.  One  problem  is 
that  typical  models  with  sufficient  flexibility  can  be  complex 

12  Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  2(1)  7-18,  March  2004 

with  large  numbers  of  parameters.  These  parameters 
can  be  difficult to  estimate  and  even  if  the  parameter 
values  are  known  the  model  can  be difficult  to  compute. 
Thus,  one  key challenge  is  how to  efficiently compute 
the  probabilities.  There  are  several  possible approaches, 
including  approximations,  compacting  (computing 
equivalence  classes),  computing  marginal  distributions, 
and  using  conditional  distributions. 

The  problem  of  maximum  likelihood  estimation  of 
phylogenies  has  been  considered  a  notoriously difficult 
computational  problem  in  the  bioinformatics  literature 
(reviewed  in  Felsenstein,  2003).  Part  of  the  argument 
is  that  even  for  a  fixed  choice  of  parameter values, 
computing  the  probability  of  a  particular  set  of 
observations  at  the  tips  requires  exponential  time  if  done 
in  a  brute-force  manner.  By  setting  up an  appropriate 
metric  space  for  the  set  of  possible  models,  analyzing 
the  structural  properties of  the  probability  landscape over 
this  metric  space,  and  using  the  well-developed theory 
of  approximation  algorithms,  one  can  show that  it  is 
possible to  produce  guaranteed  approximations  to  the 
maximum  likelihood  for  simple  stochastic  models  of 
evolution  (Farach  and  Kannan,  1999;  Cryan  eta/.,  1998). 
One  would  like to  extend  these  ideas to  produce all  choices 
of  parameter  values that  produce high  probabilities for 
the  observed  outputs  and  extend  them  to  more  complex 
model  families. 

Several  general  schemes  are  in  common  use for 
obtaining  marginal  probabilities  from  stochastic 
processes  relatively  efficiently  including  Markov  Chain 
Monte  Carlo  (MCMC),  Gibbs  sampling,  and  Expectation 
Maximization  (EM).  However,  actual  efficiency and 
implementation 
is  case-dependent.  Conditional 
distributions are  also commonly  used  in  computing 
random  variables  (Gentle,  2003).  The  idea  here  is  to 
find  an  easily  computable  distribution that  is a dominating 
distribution  for  the  domain  of  the  random  variable we 
desire.  The  desired  distribution  may  be  computed 
conditional  on  the  dominating  distribution.  Application 
of  all  of  these  techniques  to  computational  biology 
problems  is  still  in  infancy. 
Null  hypothesis-based  value  schemes 

BLAST  is  perhaps  the  most  famous  program  that 
produces  value  schemes  in  its  output  that  rely  on  a  null 
hypothesis.  The  null  hypothesis  used  by  BLAST  is  a fairly 
simple  one  - sequences  generated  position  by  position 
in  i.i.d.  fashion.  In  some  applications  an  overly  simple 
null  hypothesis can  artificially  lower  the  "background 
signal"  level  thereby  causing  us  to  misread  too  many 
things  as  strong  signals,  and  thus  become  inundated 
with  too  much  signal.  As  an  example,  the  BLAST  statistics 

do not  reflect  the  fact  that  all  of  the  sequences  in  the 
databases  have a  dependency structure  imposed  by 
their  evolutionary  history.  Thus  if  the  researcher would 
like to  assess the  probability of  getting  a  hit  of  score 
X if  one  were  to  search  all  molecules  in  life  (as  opposed 
to  all  random  sequences),  the  resulting  p-value would 
be  quite different.  The algorithmic  difficulty with  a  more 
sophisticated  null  hypothesis  is  that  computing  the 
probability can  be very  hard.  For  instance,  one  can  easily 
generate th,e  null  distribution  that  corresponds to  a 
Jukes-Cantor process,  but  uniformly sampling  strings 
of  a  certain  length  generated  by a grammar  is  a  difficult 
problem. 

Using value schemes to integrate algorithmic analysis 

As  mentioned  above,  once analysis  algorithms  produce 
probability scores  for  the  results  vis-a-vis the  focused 
biological  inference,  standard  probability calculus  can 
be  used  to  derive a  combined  inference.  The  key  is 
constructing  a  reasonable  manner  by  which  joint 
probabilities  can  be  considered.  For  example,  given two 
pairs  of  genes  A and  B,  we  may wish  to estimate  whether 
they  have  direct  molecular  interactions.  Analysis  of  a 
functional  genomics  data  set  with  protein-protein  (P-P) 
interaction  information  may  yield  some  estimate  of  Prob(A 
and  B interact!  positive  P-P assay scores).  Another 
analysis  of  their transcriptional  co-expression  may  yield 
another  probability score  P(A and  B interact  I expression 
correlation  )  0.5).  The  question  is  how to  compute  Prob(A 
and  B interact  I positive  P-P scores AND  expression 
correlation  )  0.5).  This  requires  us  to  model  certain  joint 
distributions and  in  a  more  complicated  set  of  analyses, 
postulate a  dependency  relationship  as  the  full  joint 
distribution  of  all  outcomes.  A  possible example  of  such 
combined  inference  is  so-called  Bayesian  integration 
methods (Drawid  and  Gerstein,  2000;  Troyanskaya  et 
a/.,  2003).  This  method  involves  selecting  a  prior 
assumption  on  marginal  distributions  (i.e.,  the  prior 
distributions)  and  an  inter-relational  structure  possibly 
represented  as  a  graphical  model.  One  problem  with 
this  approach  is  that  in  many  cases  the  prior structure 
for  the  relationship  of  the joint  events  is  extremely  poorly 
known.  It  is  difficult  to  introduce  reasonable  assumptions 
about  the  inter-relationships of  many  outcomes.  For 
example,  it  is  very difficult  to  state  with  confidence the 
joint  probability of  positive  outcomes for  two  different 
interaction  assays  for  two  genes,  say from  proteomics 
and  from  expression  analysis. 

A possible approach  here  is  to  estimate  the  dependent 
relationships  through  a  training  set.  This  would  be 
analogous  to typical  network  modeling  of  gene  regulation. 
For  example,  we  may  wish  to  predict  whether a  given 

Computational  Challenges  for  Integrative  Genomics  13 

open  reading  frame  codes  for  G  protein-coupled 
receptors  (GPCR;  a  particular  kind  of  protein).  We  may 
have  a  training  data  set  with  known  GPCRs,  several 
different  prediction  algorithms  (e.g.,  Kim  et at.,  2000) 
with  probability scores.  For  each  input sequence,  each 
prediction  algorithm  produces a  marginal  probability 
value  of  GPCR  assignment.  Again,  the  relationship 
between  algorithm  outputs  and  the  combined  output  can 
be  represented  as  a  probabilistic  graphical  model.  We 
can  then  estimate  the  graph  structure  and  conditional 
probabilities that  maximize  the  likelihood  of  training 
dataset assignment  at  a special  "combined  output''  vertex 
(Friedman  and  Koller,  2003).  Possible  problems  here 
mirror  those  of  standard  network  models,  that  is, 
computational  complexity  is  high  and  it  is  difficult to  obtain 
sufficient  amounts  of  data. 

Integrating different parametric models  through  a 
connecting  semi-parametric  model  criteria 

Process  models  are  often  integrated  into  analysis 
algorithms  in  the  construction  of  the  objective function 
or  distance  measures.  For  example,  a  model  of  molecular 
evolution  might  be  incorporated  into a  likelihood  objective 
function  or distance  measures  between  two  sequences. 
Each  objective  function  or  distance  measure  with  a finite 
set  of  parameters  might  be  seen  as  representing  a 
parametric  process  model.  One  approach  to  integrating 
different  models  is  by connecting  the  different  objective 
functions  or  distance  measures  into  a semi-parametric 
family  of  models.  Suppose  we  have  k  different objective 
functions  or  distance  measures,  MD, p,), ... ,  fk(D,  pJ, 
where  D is  the  input  data  and  Pi  is  the  ith  parameter 
set.  A  simple  semi-parametric function  is  a weighted 
linear combination  L(D,a  , p) = a1~(D, p,)+ .. +akfk (D,  Pk), 
where  a1  is  the  ith  mixture  coefficient.  This  construction 
marginal  objective  function  by setting  all  ak= 0,  k * i. 
has  the  desirable  property that  we  can  recover  the  ith 

An  example  of  combining  models 

through 
semi-parametric criteria  comes  from  recent  work  in 
phylogenetic  methods.  J.  Kim  and  M.  Sanderson 
(unpublished)  constructed  such  a  semi-parametric 
model  for  phylogeny  reconstruction  where  the 
semi-parametric function  spanned  the  different  models 
from  the  standard  maximum  parsimony  estimator  to  the 
standard  maximum  likelihood  estimator.  In  this  case,  the 
maximum  parsimony  estimator  had  an  objective  function 
of  the  form  fm,J..D,  p,  .. Â· Pn)  while the  maximum  likelihood 
had  the  form  trri..D.  p, = P2. =  ... Pn).  That  is,  the  maximum 
likelihood  estimator  had  an  identical  objective function 
but  maximized  over a  subspace  of  possible  parameter 
set.  This  led  to  a semi  parametric  estimator  of  the  form 
L(D,a  ,p)=fmp(D,p,  ...  Pn)+a  Â·Vat(P,"'Pn),  thus  when 

a  = 0,  it  led  to  the  standard  maximum  parsimony  model 
whereas  when  a = oo,  it  forced  the  variance  term  to  zero 
resulting  in  the  standard  maximum  likelihood  estimator. 
This  is  a special  case  of  different  models where  the  models 
differ  by  subspace  restrictions on  the  parameter  set. 
The  key  to  this  kind  of  model  integration  by 
semi-parametric objective function  construction  is 
selecting  the  appropriate  connecting  function.  While  a 
linear  connecting  function  is  simple,  there  are  several 
desirable  properties  to  consider  and  remain  as  open 
problems: 

(1)  Given  some  general  form  for  the  connecting  function, 
L(D, a, p),  and  a  reasonable  definition  of  function 
complexity,  say  number  of  parameters,  what  is  the 
least  complex function  such  that  there  are  values 
of  a  that  recovers  each  marginal  objective function? 
This  problem  asks  us  to  construct  a  connecting 
function  in  a  minimal  way  such  that  we  can  set  the 
parameters  of  the  connecting  function  to  recover  the 
properties  of  each  input  objective  function.  Thus,  we 
are  guaranteed  that  the  semi-parametric  model 
"contains"  all  the  input  models. 

(2)  For  objective  functions,  we  are typically  interested 
in  the  characteristics  of  the  points  of  the  parameter 
set  (or  functions  of  the  points)  at  the  extrema.  For 
example,  if  the  objective  function  is  the  likelihood 
function  for  a  phylogeny  given  some  model  of 
molecular  evolution,  then  we  are  interested  in  what 
kinds  of  trees  are  output  for  some  input  dataset;  that 
is  what  kinds  of  trees  maximize the  likelihood  function. 
If 'we  were  to  construct  a semi-parametric  objective 
function,  then  we  would  be  interested  in  the trees 
at  the  maximum  of  the  new objective function.  Suppose 
now we  were  given  some  collection  of  objective 
functions  (and  implied  models)  and  a  set  of  data. 
Also,  suppose  we  had  a desired  output  for  each  input 
data,  say as  a training  set.  Is  there  an  efficient  way 
to  construct  a semi-parametric connecting  objective 
function  such  that  the  function  has  parameter  values 
at  which  the  training  set  can  be  recovered?  That 
is,  if  we  are  given  some  choice  of  models  and  a 
set  of  desired  outputs  for  an  input data  set,  can  we 
construct  a family  of  integrated  models that  will  recover 
the  outputs?  This  question  asks whether  a  method 
can  be  found  to  constructively  generate  a 
semi-parametric  method  that  might  agree  with  some 
prior  biological  knowledge. 

(3)  The  semi-parametric connection  function  is  a  family 
of  models  in  which  depending  on  some  parameter 
set,  which  we  denoted  as a  ,  we  can  change  the 
behavior  of  the  analysis  making  it  more  like one  model 

14  Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  2(1)  7-18,  March  2004 

versus  another.  In  biological  situations,  this  change 
in  behavior  may  be  scale  or  process  dependent.  For 
example,  when  comparing  the  expression  of  two 
genes,  at  low  levels  of  expression  we  might  consider 
their  behavior similar  because  both  are  nearly  "off". 
However,  at  higher  levels  of  expression  one  might 
say the  genes are  related  if  the  expression  levels 
are  correlated  over  different  experiments.  One  simple 
semi-parametric  implementation  of  this  scenario  is 
as  !1....x, .0 =a  I x- y I +(1-a )cos -1(x, .0.  That  is,  as 
a weighted  combination  of  the  Euclidean  distance 
between  the  two  expression  levels  x and  y  and  the 
correlation  between  x and  y  (the  angle).  Biological 
reasoning  suggests that the  mixture parameter a should 
be  related  to  the  input  values  themselves.  This 
suggests  a  new class  of  semi-parametric objective 
model  families  where  the  choice  of  the  particular 
function  is  selected  by the  input  data themselves. 
Similar  problems  might  be  raised  with  the  training 
data  set  idea  discussed  above.  Can  we  construct 
a  semi-parametric  model 
that  chooses  the 
appropriate  member  of  the  family  from  the 
characteristics  of  the  input  data?  Studying  this  class 
of  semi-parametric  models  is  likely to  lead  to  other 
problems  such  as  whether one  might  be  able to 
construct  a  family  that  can  be  consistently  trained. 

Model  Integration 
In  a  biological  context  the  term  'modeling'  generally  refers 
to  an  abstraction  of  a  biological  system  amenable  to 
analysis  for  understanding  and  eventual  prediction  of 
the  systems  behavior  via  analytical  or  numerical 
computation.  Many of  the  best  computational  analysis 
tools  implicitly and  explicitly  incorporate  models  of 
biological  processes  including  biophysical,  biochemical, 
physiological,  morphological,  and  evolutionary 
processes.  For  example,  stochastic  models  of  molecular 
evolution  are  used  in  likelihood-based  estimation  of 
phylogenies  and  known  splicing  reactions  are  used  in 
gene  prediction  algorithms.  As  noted  above,  model 
integration  has  very wide-ranging  interpretations  and 
possible  directions.  Here  we  provide some  example of 
how  biologically  motivated  process  models  might  be 
exploited  in  order to  develop a  richer  set  of  models  for 
molecular  sequence  and  gene  expression  data. 

Biological  Criteria  for  Data  Encapsulation 
In  our  discussion  of  data  integration  we  discussed  the 
need  to  characterize  and  encapsulate  data  in  such  a 
way  as  to  make  it  "context  independent"  and 
"comparable." The  suitability of  different encapsulation 

schemes  often  depends on  the  questions  being  asked, 
however  a  number of  biological  criteria  are  commonly 
invoked  to  establish  comparability.  For  example,  referring 
to  portions  of  a  proteins as  a "domains"  is  one  type of 
encapsulation  motivated  by an  underlying  biological 
hypothesis of  similarity  with  respect  to  structure and 
function.  Another  primary  biological  model  for  establishing 
comparable  and  context 
independent  units  of 
characterization  is  that  of  homology.  The  concept  of 
homology  invokes 'a  notion  of  "sameness" and  continuity 
of  descent  (i.e.  traits  in  different  organisms  that 
correspond  to a single trait  in  a common  ancestor;  Wagner, 
2001;  Wagner  and  Stadler,  2003).  period  Hand  in  hand 
with  homology statements  is  the  notion  that  biological 
systems  can  be  decomposed 
into  sets  of 
quasi-independent elements.  That  is,  we  recognize  units 
of  homology  by the  fact  that  such  units  exhibit  a certain 
degree  of  independence  through  development  or 
evolution.  Hypotheses  of  homology and  decomposability 
are  widely  used  in  genomics,  either  implicitly or  explicitly. 
For  example,  the  BLAST  algorithm  can  be  seen  as 
generating  a set  of  ranked  hypotheses about  sequence 
homology.  In  fact,  statements  of  homology are  often  an 
absolute  requirement  for  comparative  genomic  analyses. 
A particularly  pressing  challenge  if  we  are to achieve 
an  integrative  genomics that  scales  from  sequences  to 
phenotypes  is  to  come  up with  useful  working  definitions 
of  homology that  can  be applied  at  levels  of  organization 
above  the  sequence  level.  For  example,  a way  of  defining 
homology at  the  level  of  genetic subnetworks would 
greatly facilitate  comparative  functional  genomic  analyses 
across  disparate  genomes  by focusing  attention  on 
similarities  and  dissimilarities  among  groups 
(subnetworks)  of  genes  rather  than  individual  genes. 
Similarly,  a  suitable  decomposition  in  terms  of 
subnetworks  would  be  useful  at  the  level  of  analysis 
integration.  For  example,  given  data on  gene  expression 
and  protein-protein  interaction  we  might  ask whether 
these  two  types  of  data  are telling  us  the  same  thing, 
not  on  a gene-by-gene basis,  but  rather  at  the  level 
of  sets  of  interacting  genes (i.e.  the  details  might  be 
different,  but  the  story  is  essentially the  same).  Similar 
challenges  remain  for  defining  homology for  complex 
phenotypes  (e.g.  behavior). 

Model  Derived  Constraints 
Above  we  discussed  some  of  the  challenges  we  face 
when  trying  to  integrate  value  schemes  from  different 
types  of  analyses.  How,  for  example,  might we  calculate 
joint  probabilities for  outcomes  at  two  distinct  levels of 
biological  organization  or  operating  under  distinct 
evolutionary  models?  As  a concrete  example,  suppose 

Computational  Challenges  for  Integrative  Genomics  15 

we  have an  algorithm  for  producing  the  likely starting 
positions  of  a  particular  gene (annotated  with  value 
schemes)  and  another  algorithm  for  producing  the  likely 
locations  of  regulatory  elements  for  that  gene  similarly 
annotated.  We  would  like to  combine  the  information 
produced  by these  algorithms  in  order  to  come  up with 
a  combined  representation  of  the  genome  in  terms  of 
gene-promoter  pairs.  One approach  is  to  view the  outputs 
of  the  two algorithms  as  random  variables X  and  Y 
respectively.  The  value  schemes  associated  with  the 
algorithms  give  us  "prior"  distributions  for  X and  Y.  How 
might  we  derive  the  posterior  distribution  of  interest? 
We  suggest that  one way  to  facilitate  such  integration 
is  to  encode  empirically  or  computationally  derived 
biological  knowledge  as  models  that  specify constraints 
or  probabilities  on  the  possible outcomes  at  a different 
level.  For  example,  detailed  studies  of  genes  and 
promoters  across  might  lead  us  to  the  conclusion  that, 
generally speaking,  "Regulatory elements  occur within 
5K  base  pairs  of  exons."  This  imposes  a constraint  on 
the  joint distribution of X and Y.  The  posterior  distributions 
of X and  Y are  the  marginal  distributions of  this  constrained 
joint  distribution.  To  generalize,  we  expect  the  biological 
constraints  governing  the  relationship  between  two 
random  variables  to  take  the  form  of  constraints.  The 
constraints  might  be  (1)  structural  constraints  which  are 
based  on  the  geometry of  the  object  being  found  by 
the  algorithm;  (2)  relational  constraints  in  which  certain 
set  of  measurements  have functional  relationships;  and 
(3)  abundance  constraints  which  are  constraints  on  how 
many or  how few  a number  of  some  feature  must  occur 
around  a  particular  locus.  A  challenge  is  to  develop 
general  algorithmic  techniques  for  computing  (modes 
of)  posterior  distributions  under any of  these  types  of 
constraints.  A constraint  oriented  view  of  joint  priors  can 
lead  to  new  algorithmic  approaches.  For  example,  joint 
distributions can  be  described  more  succinctly from  a 
geometrical  point  of  view  (e.g.,  Allman  and  Rhodes,  2003; 
Geiger  et a/.,  2002;  Kim,  2000). 

Extended  models  of  molecular  evolution 
Many sequence  models  such  as  HMM  and  generative 
grammar  models  are  described  in  terms  of  "sequence 
production",  but  in  reality  sequences  are  not  generated 
or  produced  in  the  manner  described  by these  models. 
For  example,  HMMs  describe  sequence  generation  as 
a  left  to  right  production  of  nucleotide  symbols,  but  this 
is  not  how the  original  sequences  are  produced  by 
biology.  In  fact,  the  sequences  have  a  biological 
generative  process,  namely  genealogical  inheritance and 
evolutionary  change.  Models  of  molecular  evolution 
provide  fundamental  principles  for  inferring  biological 

processes  from  static  data  (e.g.,  inference of  phylogenetic 
trees  representing  genealogical  relationship)  and  help 
to  assess  probabilistic  significance of  inferred  patterns 
(e.g.,  probability of  sequence  identity  between  two 
homologous  molecules).  As  the  types  of  genomic  data 
grow,  there  is  a need  to  develop  new  models  and  extend 
currents  models  for  new  types  of  data  and  more 
complicated  modes  of  evolution.  Here  we  discuss three 
examples,  evolutionary  dynamics  of  short  oligo tags, 
non-coding  sequences,  and  gene  expression. 

Evolutonary  dynamics  of short  oligomers 

High-throughput  technologies  often  use  small 
subsequences,  oligomers  (  100  bases,  as  surrogate 
markers  for  larger  sequences.  Even  under  standard 
models  of  evolution  for  larger  sequences,  e.g.  Poisson 
mutation  process,  the  dynamics  of  sequence tags  are 
not  well  understood.  The  solution  to  this  problem  will 
impact  many techniques  such  as  arrays  that  depend 
on  the  detection  of  short  sequence  motifs.  As  a first  step 
problem,  suppose  we  have  a collection  of  sequences 
related  to  each  other  by a  tree  graph.  This  tree  graph 
may  represent  genealogies  of  whole  genomes  or  the 
genealogy  of  gene  duplications  within  a  genome. 
Assuming  a constant  rate  Poisson  mutation  process,  we 
wish  to  know  the  dynamics of  the  presence/absence 
of  sequences  tags  of  particular  length  k.  We  have studied 
this  problem  tor  tags  of  sufficient  length  and  fixed  size 
such  that  the  probability of  non-homologous  presence 
is  low;  under this  simple  scenario the  probability of 
presence of  a tag  of  length  kat some  node  in  the  tree 
is  a  geometric  distribution  with  parameters  dependent 
on  the  relative  time-length  of  the  left  and  right  subtrees 
pending  from  the  node.  However,  for  even  this  simple 
problem,  the  solution  is  unknown  for  the  ensemble  of 
tag  lengths  because  the  different  tags  and  tags  at  different 
length  are  dependent  on  each  other. 
Evolutionary dynamics  of non-coding sequences 

Functional  non-coding sequences  include  promoters, 
enhancers,  chromatin  structural  elements,  small  RNA 
elements,  as  well  as  introns and  UTRs  (e.g.  Hall  eta!., 
2002;  Chi  eta!.,  2003;  Herbert,  2004).  These  kinds  of 
elements are  subject  to  different  kinds  of  evolutionary 
forces,  such  as  frequent  insertions  and  deletions, 
sequence  conversion,  and  transpositions  (Carter  and 
Wagner,  2002;  Lynch,  2002;  Hahn  eta!.,  2003).  For 
example,  Kim  (2001)  has  studied  the  evolutionary 
dynamics  of  intervening  sequences  in  between 
conserved  sequences  in  the  regulatory  region  of  the 
Drosophila gene  hairy and  found  evidence for  neutral 
random  change  in  sequence  length.  Functional  annotation

d  these kirds d  elemenls  has  been  the focus d  reN research 
efforts (ENCODE;  http://www.genome.gov/ENCODE}.  In 
particular,  it  would  be  desirable  to  use  models  of 
evolutionary dynamics  for  both  algorithm  development 
and  for  significance  calculations.  Currently,  most  of  the 
algorithms and  probability calculations  are  based  on  point 
mutations  or small-order  linear  dependency  models. 
The  primary work  required  for  these  studies  is  a 
systematic  study of  the  empirical  evidence.  Compilations 
of  the  positional  distribution  of  the  non-coding 
sequences,  such  as  frequency  distribution  of the  length 
of  conserved  sequences,  frequency  distribution  of 
intervening  sequences,  and  their  relation  to  the  coding 
sequences  is  only  beginning  to  be available (e.g.,  Stein 
et at.,  2003;  Kent  et at.,  2003;  Cooper  et at.,  2003;  Hampson 
et at.,  2002;  Jareborg  et at.,  1999}.  Comparative  genomics 
approaches  have  been  useful  in  this  context  and  have 
lead  to  methods for  functional  prediction  (e.g.,  Levy  et 
at.,  2001;  Rivas  eta!.,  2001;  Wasserman  et at.,  2000}. 
The  observed  empirical  distributions can  be used  to  derive 
heuristic significance  values  for  predicted  non-coding 
sequences.  Statistical  compilations  can  give  heuristic 
assessment  of  significance of  a given  putative  functionally 
important  non-coding  sequence.  But,  for  more  principled 
inference,  an  evolutionary  process  model  will  need  to 
be  developed  building  on  the  recent  works  studying  the 
evolution  of  non-coding  sequences  (e.g.,  Kim,  2001; 
Rogozin  et a!.,  2002;  Ohta,  1997}. 
Evolutionary  dynamics  of gene  expression 

Recent  studies  (Rifkin  eta!.,  2003}  indicate that  the 
expression  level  of  individual  genes  follow an  evolutionary 
dynamics  similar  to  many  continuous  quantitative traits 
(e.g.,  body  size,  bristle  numbers).  Traditionally, 
quantitative trait  evolution  is  modeled  using  a variety of 
diffusion  processes  (reviewed  in  Hansen,  1997).  For 
example,  a quantitative trait  under  stabilizing  selection 
can  been  modeled  using  the  Orstein-Uhlenbeck process 
(diffusion  under a centralizing  force-field;  Hansen,  1997; 
Hansen  and  Martins,  1996).  These  kinds  of  models  can 
be  used  to  predict the  expected  dispersion  of  gene 
expression  levels  across  different  lineages  of  organisms 
which  in  turn  can  be  used  to  predict the functional 
significance of  expression  level  akin  to  the  kinds  of 
inferences  made  in  sequence analysis.  There  are  several 
open  problems  here:  (1)  methods to  measure fundamental 
parameters  of  the  process from  data;  (2)  incorporation 
of  pleiotropic  and  epistatic  regulatory connections 
between  different  genes;  and  (3)  extension  to  different 
kinds  of  continuous  stochastic  processes. 

One  of  the  fundamental  parameters  in  such  a  model 
is  the  gene  specific  rate  of  mutational  change  per  unit 

time  (in  the  expression  level).  A complicating  factor  is 
that  different  genes  have different  degrees  of  epistatic 
input from  other  genes  that  affect  its  expression.  A gene 
with  a large  number of  other  genes affecting  ns  expression 
is  also  expected  to  show a  high  mutation  rate  because 
the  change  in  any of  the  other  genes  will  affect  its 
expression.  One  possible  approach  is  to  estimate a 
characteristic degree of  regulatory  connectivity for  a 
particular organism  and  model  ensemble  behavior. 
Finally,  many  varieties  of  diffusion  processes  predict a 
normal  distribution  for  the trait  value.  Typical  gene 
expression  data  sets,  studied  under artificial  mutagenesis, 
show a  distribution  similar to  a  normal  distribution  but 
with  a large tail  indicating  a mixture  model  of  small  effects 
(normal)  and  large  effects  (long  tail)  (e.g.,  Hughes,  2000; 
Rifkin  et at.,  2000}.  Such  mixture  models  can  be  studied 
by  pooling  the  various  studies and  using,  for  example, 
Bayesian  estimation  procedures  to  separate  the 
distributions.  For  modeling  quantitative evolutionary 
dynamics,  an  important  determinant  is  the  genetic 
component  of  the  linear variance-covariance  structure 
of  the traits  (ct.,  Lande,  1979;  Lande  and  Arnold,  1983). 
This  is  because,  similar  to  the  gradient matrix of  a 
continuous  dynamical  system,  the  linear  genetic 
variance-covariance  matrix determines the  short-term 
direction  and  magnitude  of  change.  The  main 
complication  in  the  gene expression  case  is  extreme  high 
dimensionality and  possibly  complicated  high-order joint 
distributional  structure.  However,  from  many  empirical 
observations,  it  is  clear  that  the  dynamics of  gene 
expression,  whether  in  a  developmental  sense  or  with 
respect  to  genetic variants,  do not  fully  span  the  possible 
dimensions,  in  fact  all  evidence suggests far  less  (e.g., 
Rifkin  et at.,  2000).  Thus,  one  possible approach  is  to 
reduce  dimensionality  by estimating  the  "biologically 
relevant",  i.e.,  noise-free,  dimensions of  the  gene 
expression  space  and 
the 
variance-covariance  structure with  respect  to  some 
reasonable  basis vector  of  the  reduced  dimensions.

Conclusions 
In  the  introduction  to this  review  we  noted  that  many 
genomic  approaches  share at  least  one  major feature 
- high  throughput  systematic collection  of  data without 
explicit  predefined  hypotheses.  While  such  efforts  have 
been  critiqued  as  being  "fishing  expeditions"  there  is 
a  real  strength  in  leveraging  large-scale data  both  for 
specific  problems as  well  as  for  new  problems.  In 
particular,  as  our  knowledge  of  the  organism  becomes 
more  complete  and  complex,  we  expect  that  the  nature 
of  the  questions  we  pose  will  change.  Already,  in  the 

Computational  Challenges  for  Integrative  Genomics  17 

field  of  gene  regulation  we  have  moved  from  the  concept 
of  "master  regulatory  genes"  to  gene  regulatory  cascades. 
Numerous  analyses  of  functional  genomic  data  suggest 
that  co-regulatory dynamics  tend  to  be  both  complex 
and  context  dependent.  Thus  the  question  of  interest 
may  not  be  whether  any  given  gene  interacts  with  any 
other  gene  (the  answer  may  be  both  "yes"  and  "no" 
depending  on  context),  but  rather  "what  is  the  overall 
architecture  of  genetic  regulatory  interactions which 
drives  the  dynamics  of  the  system?" 

Our  science  moves  beyond  the  descriptive,  to  the 
"integrative",  when  we  begin to  use  genomic data to 
test  or derive  specific  biological  hypotheses.  We  are at 
a  point  where  we  can  begin  to  undertake such  model 
driven  approaches to  genomics.  However,  it  is  our  view 
that  to  do so  effectively the  field  will  have to  address 
many of  the  issues  raised  in  the  previous  pages.  Most 
critical  amongst  these  challenges  is  developing  a  unified 
theoretical  foundation  for  biological  data  analysis  and 
knowledge  representation.  In  the  end,  all  our  scientific 
knowledge  is  model  based  or  theory  based.  Even  the 
proper  interpretation  of  the  movement  of  a  nucleotide 
sequence  on  an  agarose  gel  requires  a  model  theoretic 
understanding  of  statistical  mechanics.  The  main 
difference  between  such  measurements  and  genome 
scale  measurements  is  that  we  already  have  a 
well-defined  model  understanding  of  the  movements  of 
charged  molecules  in  an  electrical  field.  The  future  waits 
for  a similar  model  theoretic  view  of  the  whole  genome 
and  the  organism.
