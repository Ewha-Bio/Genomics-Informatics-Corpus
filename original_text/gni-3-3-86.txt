Abstract 
Human  brain  EST data provide important clues for our 
understanding of the molecular biology associated with 
the  function  of  the  normal  brain  and  the  molecular 
pathophysiology with brain disorders. To systematically 
and  efficiently  study the  function  and  disorders  of  the 
human brain,  45,773 human brain  ESTs were collected 
from  27  human  brain  eDNA  libraries,  which  were 
constructed from normal brains and brain disorders such 
as brain tumors, Parkinson's disease (PO) and epilepsy. 
An analysis of 45,773 human brain ESTs using our EST 
analysis  pipeline  resulted  in  38,396  high-quality  ESTs 
and  35,906  ESTs,  which  were  coalesced  into  8,246 
unique gene clusters,  showing a significant similarity to 
known genes in the human RefSeq, human mRNAs and 
UniGene  database.  In  addition,  among  8,246  gene 
clusters,  4,287  genes  (52%)  were  found  to  contain 
full-length  eDNA  clones.  To  facilitate  the  extraction  of 
useful information in collected these human brain ESTs, 
we  developed  a  user-friendly  interface  system,  the 
Korea Brain Unigene Database (KBUD). The KBUD web 
interface allows access to our human brain data through 
three  major  search  modes,  the  BioCarta  pathway, 
keywords  and  BLAST  searches.  Each  result  when 
viewed  in  KBUD  offers  comprehensive  information 
concerning the analyzed human brain ESTs provided by 
our data as  well  as  data  linked to various  other public 
databases. The user-friendly developed KBUD,  the first 
world-wide web interface for human brain EST data with 
ESTs of human brain disorders as well as normal brains, 
will  be  a  helpful  system  for  developing  a  better 
understanding  of  the  underlying  mechanisms  of  the 
normal brain well as brain disorders. The KBUD system 
is freely accessible at http://kugi.kribb.re.kr/KU/cgi

Introduction 
The large-scale EST collections of mammalian brains 
including the human brain were performed to rapidly 
identify the expressed genes and understand the gene 
regulation in the brain. These brain  ESTs have been 
produced as the result of worldwide efforts, with major 
contributions being made through the Brain Molecular 
Anatomy Project (BMAP, http://trans.nih.gov/bmap/), the 
NIH-Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC,  http://mgc.nci. 
nih.gov/),  and  the  Cancer  Genome  Anatomy  Project 
(CGAP, http://cgap.nci.nih.gov). These efforts permit the 
discovery of transcripts that are expressed  in  the brain 
and  attempt  to  localize  the  site  of  expression  of  all 
transcripts in the brain by large-scale parallel analyses of 
gene  expression.  In  addition,  the  collected  brain  ESTs 
can  serve as key resources for brain functional studies 
based on genomics, including exon detection, alternative 
splicing analysis, single-nucleotide polymorphisrns (SNPs) 
and gene expression studies using a microarray as well as 
gene discovery and gene mapping (Adams et a/.,  1992; 
Boguski eta/., 1995; Ermolaeva eta/., 1998; Mathe eta/., 
2002; Picoult-Newberg eta/., 1999). In addition, an EST 
set obtained from specific regions of the brain in the case 
of certain brain diseases provides molecular insights into 
biological  phenomena  and  cellular  physiology  under 
specific brain disease conditions. 

Several databases for genes that are expressed in the 
brain  have  been  reported  to  date.  The  NCBI's  dbEST 
database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/} supplies 
BMAP mouse brain EST sequences. The CGAP website 
provides  an  index  of  the  genes  that  are  generated  in 
various cancer tissues including brain cancer in humans 
and  the  mouse.  In  addition,  the  Electronic Atlas  of the 
Developing Human Brain (EADHB) database (http://www. 
ncl.ac.uk/ihg/EADHB/database/EADHB_database. html) 
and  the  EMAGE  Mouse  Gene  Expression  Database 
provide  gene  expression  patterns  during  the  early 
development of the human brain, and information related 
to spatial 20 and 3D visualizations for them. The human 
brain EST database, which provides information concerning 

KBUD: The Korea Brain  UniGene Database  87 

genes expressed in normal human brain as well as human 
brain disorders such as brain tumor and PD, has not been 
reported,  although the BMAP database supplies mouse 
brain ESTs and the CGAP database supplies for genes 
expressed  in  various  cancer  tissues  including  human 
brain cancer. 

To systematically and efficiently study the function and 
disorders of the human brain, a collection of an entire set 
of  genes  expressed  in  the  normal  brain  and  in  brain 
disorders  such  as  brain  tumor,  PD  and  epilepsy  was 
performed  as  a  part  of  the  MOST 21 C  Frontier  R & D 
program in neuroscience, started in Korea. For the efficient 
collection  of  full-length  cDNAs  and  rarely  expressed 
genes,  we  used  oligo-capping  methods  to  construct 
full-length  eDNA  libraries  (Oh  et at.,  2004)  and  Bento 
Soares's method to construct a normalized eDNA library 
(Soares et at.,  1994). By large scale sequencing of the 
clones from these brain libraries, a large number of human 
brain ESTs could be generated. To extract various type of 
information from these brain ESTs and facilitate their use, 
we developed  a  user-friendly web  interface,  the  Korea 
Brain Unigene Database (KBUD) system. In this paper, we 
describe  the  human  brain  EST  analysis  pipeline,  the 
construction of the KBUD system and its use. The KBUD 
system  provides  the  various  information  of our human 
brain  ESTs  and  allows the  investigator to  undertake  a 
sophisticated search using relevant linked websites. 

Methods 
Human brain EST sequence data 
The human brain EST sequences used in this study were 
obtained by the 5' -end sequencing of the clones from 27 
high-quality brain eDNA libraries containing a full-length 
eDNA library, normalized eDNA libraries and subtracted 
eDNA  libraries,  constructed  using  various  methods,  as 
described previously (Kim  et at.,  2004;  Oh  eta/., 2004; 
Soares et at., 1994). The brain tissue samples used were 
as follows:  One  normal  brain tissue,  ten  different brain 
tumor tissues, and one temporal lobe and three different 
hippocampuses  from  epilepsy  patients  as  well  as  one 
normal  substantia nigra from  a normal subject and one 
substantia nigra from a PD patient. 

Human brain EST analysis 
Pre-processing:  Base-calling  and  quality  assessment 
were  performed  with  the  phred  program  (Ewing  et at. 
1998). Vector and linker sequences were located using 
the  FASTA  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk!fasta/)  program  and 
were subsequently removed.  Low-quality bases defined 
by the ph red program were trimmed from both ends of the 

EST  sequences.  Human  repetitive  elements  and  low 
complexity regions were masked using the RepeatMasker 
(http://repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu) program. 
EST sequences having an  identity of at least 90% with 
human  mitochondrial DNAs or ribosomal  RNAs over at 
least 90bp were also excluded.  ESTs of at least 100 bp 
after both vector and low-quality trimming were regarded 
as "high-quality"  ESTs. 
Annotation: The annotation of the ESTs was carried out by 
stand-alone BLAST programs and locally installed 
databases  (Altschul  et at.,  1990). The  individual 
high-quality ESTs were searched against the human 
RefSeq (Pruitt et at.,  2005). The remaining ESTs were 
searched against the human mRNA (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ 
genbankl) subset extracted from the GenBank database and 
subsequently against the UniGene database (Hs.seq.all, 
build #184) for similarity comparisons using BLASTN. We 
carried out a BLAST search with a cut-off identity of 97% 
and an E value of 1 e"10
, and over at least 100 bp of ESTs 
compared with the RefSeq, GenBank mRNA and UniGene 
data. After the ESTs were clustered into gene indices by 
the BLAST results and a eDNA clone containing the best 
hit score in each cluster was invested with I D (ex. BKU000001 ), 
selected  as  a  representative  unique  gene.  The  CAP3 
program was used to assemble the ESTs in each cluster 
into contigs (Huang et at.,  1999). 
Detennination  of full-length  eDNA: The  fullness  of  our 
human  brain  ESTs was determined by comparing  EST 
sequences  against  the  coding  sequences  of  Human 
RefSeq entries and known human mRNAs. We categorized 
them into four groups, as follows: 1) full-length eDNA (Full); 
at least 97% identity over the first 100 bases of the CDS 
(coding sequence), including the ATG initiation codon, 2) 
candidate full-length eDNA (Can-Full);  matched at least 
1 00 bp against the 5' UTR of the upstream CDS region, 3) 
partial  eDNA  (Partial);  not containing  an  ATG  initiation 
codon and matched at least 1 00 bp against CDS region, 
4) 3' UTR; not covering any CDS region and matched to 
the 3'  UTR of the downstream CDS region, 5) Unknown; 
matched only against ESTs or a gene having an unknown 
CDS region which can not be defined. 

Construction of the KBUD system 
KBUD was written using python and peri script for the EST 
annotation  work  and  was  implemented  in  a  relational 
database structure using MySQL DBMS. The web-front 
end  was  handwritten  in  HTML.  Web-based  database 
searching  was  implemented  with  CGI-Perl  scripts.  To 
allow a BLAST search of the user's query data, the BLAST 

88  Genomics & Informatics  Vol.  3{3) 86-93, September 2005 

suite  of  programs  were  downloaded  from  the  NCBI 
BLAST ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blastl).

we  constructed  27  brain  eDNA  libraries  from  various 
human brain tissues,  as shown in Table 1.  Brain tumor 
tissues  such  as,  glioblastoma,  oligodendroglioma, 
neuroblastoma and meningioma, were used in  order to 
study the pathogenesis of brain tumors. In addition, brain 
tissues obtained from patients with PD and epilepsy were 
used in order to study other brain  disorders.  27  eDNA 
libraries  consisting  of  19  full-length  enriched  eDNA 
libraries, and 7 normalized eDNA libraries and 1 subtracted 
library were constructed  from  the  start full-length  eDNA 
libraries  in  order  to  discover  genes  that  are  rarely 
expressed  in  the  brain.  In  total,  45,773  clones  were 
randomly selected from these 27 libraries and were used 
for  5'-end  single-pass  sequencing.  These  brain  ESTs 
served as the key data set of KBUD.  In addition, human 
brain  EST will  continue  to  be  generated  from  various 
eDNA  libraries  and  will  be  updated  in  the  KBUD 
accordingly. 

Human brain EST analysis pipeline 
The obtained 45,773 EST sequences were subjected to 
quality control  procedures,  as shown  in  pre-processing 
diagram in  Fig.  1,  namely, trimming of the vector region 
and the removal of low-quality or short (less than 1 00 bp) 
sequences. After screening out 1 ,616 ESTs derived from

cut-off values are described in the method section. The number of ESTs and unique gene clusters in each category are represented in 
parenthesis. 

mitochondrial  DNAs,  ribosomal  DNAs,  and  human 
repetitive sequences,  38,396 high-quality ESTs with an 
average length of 589 bp were generated. 

To  annotate  high-quality  ESTs,  38,396  ESTs  were 
sequentially  analyzed,  as  shown  in  the  annotation 
process of Fig.  1.  When we compared these ESTs with 
human RefSeq using the BLAST program, 28,787 ESTs 
(75%) showed a significant similarity to known genes in 
the human RefSeq and the remaining 6,072 ESTs (15%) 
In  addition,  the 
were  matched  to  human  mRNAs. 
remaining  1,048  EST  (3%)  were  matched  to  UniGene 
ESTs and 2,490 (7%) showed no match or a match lower 
than 97% nucleotide identity to previously reported known 
genes  in  the  public database.  A total  of  35,906  known 
ESTs  were  clustered  into  8,246  unique  known  genes 
based  on  BLAST similarity scores.  The cluster number 
per total  known  ESTs  was  estimated  to  be  about  23% 
(8,246 /35,906) from a transcript analysis using the CAP3 
program.  The  complexity  of  the  collected  genes,  on 
average, was slightly higher than that of the Cap-trapper 
eDNA libraries collated by normalization and subtraction 
(Carninci eta/., 2000). Table 2 shows that 8,246 unique gene 
clusters  consisting  of  4,777  of  contigs  and  6,597  of 
singletons  were  obtained  using  the  CAP3  program.  The 
4,m contigs were assembled from 29,309 EST sequences. 
To determine the fullness of  our human brain  ESTs, 
8,246 gene clusters for 38,396  high  quality ESTs were 
compared to human  RefSeq entires and  known  mRNA. 
As shown  in  Fig.  2,  4,287  genes  (52%)  were  shown  to 
contain  full-length  eDNA clones  (21 ,434),  whereas  291 
(4%)  contained  candidate 
full-length  eDNA  clones 
(1, 198).  In  addition,  1 ,908 genes  (23%)  contained  only 
partial  eDNA clones  (7,062)  and  1,760 (15%)  matched 
only the 3' UTR of genes from eDNA clones (5, 164). The 
frequency  of  full-length  eDNA  containing  full-length

lower  than  that  reported  by  other  researchers  using 
full-length  eDNA 
libraries.  These  data  concerning 
full-length cDNAs generated from various brain sources 
help in  understanding the regulation of the transcription 
of  genes  expressed  in  the  human  brain  and  could  be 
used  in  a functional  analysis of the  human  brain.  All  of 
these data are stored in the KBUD system. 

KBUDsystem 
To facilitate the use of the analyzed human brain  ESTs 
and to provide useful information concerning these ESTs 
for  other  investigators,  we  constructed  a  user-friendly 
web interface, the KBUD system using our human brain 
EST  data  set.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3,  the  KBUD  web 
interface allows easy access to  the data through  three 
major  search  modes,  the  BioCarta  pathway,  keyword 
and  BLAST  searches.  Each  result  provides  concise 
information concerning an interesting gene in the human 
brain  ESTs  and  more  detailed  information  can  be 
obtained  using  data linked to  diverse public databases 
such  as  Unigene,  OMIM  and  Ensemble.  The  public 
database  links  and  sequence  analysis  links  provide  a 
variety  of  resources  related  to  Korea  Brain  UniGene 
(KBU) on the internet. The wide variety of information for 
KBU using useful links permit the user to more easily and 
quickly analyze the gene for further study.

from  Korean  patients with  brain  disorders such  as brain 
tumors, PD and epilepsy. The KBUD system is quickly and 
easily  accessible  to  any  investigator  for  searching  the 
interesting brain cDNAs and also  permits more detailed
