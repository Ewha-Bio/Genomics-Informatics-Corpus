Abstract

Simple  sequence  repeats  (SSRs)  are  ubiquitous  short 
tandem  duplications  found  within  eukaryotic  genomes. 
Their  length  variability  and  abundance  throughout  the 
genome  has  led  them  to  be  widely  used  as  molecular 
markers  for  crop-breeding  programs,  facilitating  the  use 
of  marker-assisted  selection  as  well  as  estimation  of  ge-
netic  population  structure.  Here,  we  report  a  software 
application,  “SSR-Primer Generator”  for  SSR  discovery, 
SSR-primer  design,  and  homology-based  search  of  in 
silico  amplicons  from  a  DNA  sequence  dataset.  On  sub-
mission  of  multiple  FASTA-format  DNA  sequences, 
those  analyses  are  batch  processed  in  a  Java  runtime 
environment  (JRE)  platform,  in  a  pipeline,  and  the  result-
ing  data  are  visualized  in  HTML  tabular  format.  This  ap-
plication  will  be  a  useful  tool  for  reducing  the  time  and 
costs  associated  with  the  development  and  application 
of  SSR  markers.

Introduction

Simple  sequence  repeats  (SSRs)  are  DNA  elements 
found  ubiquitously  in  eukaryotic  genomes;  in  SSRs,  1-6 
nucleotides  are  tandemly  repeated.  SSR  loci  have  a  rel-

atively  high  mutation  rate,  resulting  in  variation  in  the 
number  of  repeat  units.  The  instability  of  SSRs  mainly 
results  from  slipped-strand  mispairing  errors  during  the 

DNA  replication  process  (Schlötterer,  2000).  In  partic-

ular,  the  mutation  rate  of  SSRs  has  been  suggested  to 
increase  with  the  repeat  number,  with  longer  SSRs  hav-
ing  a  mutation  bias  to  become  shorter  SSRs  (Kruglyak 
et al.,  1998).
 SSRs  are  found  throughout  the  genome.  They  are 
more  abundant  in  non-coding  regions  than  in  coding  re-
gions  (Li  et al.,  2004).  In  particular,  SSR  density  in 
non-coding  regions  was  highest  within  the  5'-UTRs  of 
genes,  followed  by  that  in  3'-UTRs,  introns,  and  inter-
genic  regions  (Hong  et al.,  2007).  In  contrast  to  non- 
coding  regions,  coding  regions  prevalently  harbor  trinu-
cleotide  SSRs,  reflecting  the  codon  structure  in  these 
regions  (Hong et al.,  2007).  SSRs  are  also  preferentially 
associated  with  gene-rich  regions,  with  heterochromatin 
SSRs  mostly  associated  with  retrotransposons  (Hong et 
al.,  2007).  These  data  suggest  that  SSR  distribution  is 
non-random.  In  particular,  association  of  SSRs  with 
genes  may  play  important  roles  in  determining  gene 
function,  such  as  altering  transcription,  translation,  RNA 
splicing  or  stability  (Li et al.,  2004).  As  an  example,  the 
expansion  of  trinucleotide  GAG  repeats  in  the  coding  re-
gion  of  the  huntingtin  gene  in  humans  can  lead  to 
Huntington’s  disease  (reviewed  in  Li  et al.,  2004).
    The  nature  of  SSRs  gives  them  a  number  of  advan-
tages  over  other  molecular  markers  (Jewell et al.,  2006): 
(i)  SSRs  show  high  transferability  between  related  spe-
cies,  with  high  allelic  diversity;  (ii)  multiple  SSR  alleles 
may  be  detected  at  a  single  locus  by  using  a  simple 
PCR-based  screen;  (iii)  SSRs  are  co-dominant;  (iv)  they 
are  distributed  all  over  the  genome,  but  especially  occur 
in  association  with  genes;  and  (v)  analysis  of  SSRs  may 
be  semi-automated.  Thus,  SSR  markers  allow  for  rapid 
generation  of  genetic  data  from  a  relatively  small 
amount  of  sample,  with  high  reliability  and  reproduci-
bility.  They  are  particularly  useful  for  genetic  mapping, 
linkage  and  association  studies,  as  well  as  for  phyloge-
netic  and  population  studies.
    Recently,  with  the  increase  in  the  availability  of  DNA 
sequence  information,  there  has  been  an  increased 
need  for  automated  methods  to  find  SSR  loci  and  de-
sign  primers  for  amplification  of  SSR  loci  from  large  se-
quence  datasets;  this  would  be  a  particularly  useful  tool 
in  crop-breeding  programs  where  it  could  aid  marker- 
assisted  selection  as  well  as  estimation  of  genetic  pop-

ulation  structure.  Moreover,  homology-based  search  for 
amplicons  including  SSRs  would  be  helpful  to  develop 
SSR  markers  linked  to  genes.  Given  this  need,  we  have 
recently  developed  an  application,  “SSR-Primer  Genera-
tor  (SSRPG),”  which  encompasses  the  following  func-
tions:  (i)  discovery  of  SSR  loci  from  large  amounts  of 
DNA  sequence  data,  including  the  SSR  flanking  regions; 
(ii)  design  of  PCR  primers  that  target  amplification  of  the 
SSR,  (iii)  homology-based  search  for  the  predicted  SSR 
amplicons,  and  (iv)  visualization  of  results.  Moreover, 
SSRPG  provides  a  function  for  producing  SSR-primer 
pairs  that  are  unique  in  an  analyzed  dataset  and  that 
form  stable  duplexes  with  the  template  DNAs  under  a 
given  PCR  condition.  The  described  application  is  pub-
licly  available  at  the  http://168.188.15.158:8080/ssrpg.

Work  Flow  of  SSRPG

SSRPG  is  a  user-friendly  web-application  for  (i)  finding 
SSRs,  (ii)  designing  SSR-primers,  and  (iii)  homology- 
based  search  for  their in silico  amplicons  in  a  batch 
process  (Fig.  1).

SSR  search 

SSRs  are  searched  from  an  input,  which  should  be  giv-
en  in  the  form  of  multiple  FASTA  format  DNA  se-
quences,  by  SPUTNIK.  The  resulting  output  is  a  com-
bined  result  table  providing  summary  information  of  the 
SSRs  identified,  and  that  includes  the  repeat  types  iden-
tified,  the  motifs  involved,  their  positions,  length,  repeat 
scores,  and  the  flanking  regions.  After  a  search  for 
SSRs,  sequences  containing  the  SSRs  and  their  flanking 
regions  and  their  summary  information  are  used  as 
queries  (sequence,  SSR-target  region,  primer  product 
size  range,  etc.)  that  are  required  for  the  creation  of  a 
PRIMER3  input  file.

SSR-primer  design 

A  PRIMER3  input  file  is  created  into  which  the  following 
parameters  are  entered:  (i)  common  parameters  for  all 
sequences,  including  required  primer  size  (20  bases), 
primer  Tm  (59oC),  primer  GC%  (maximum:  60%;  mini-
mum:  40%),  Max  Tm  difference  (integer:  1),  Max  com-
plementarity  (PRIMER_SELF_ANY=5),  Max  3'  comple-
mentarity  (PRIMER_SELF_END=2),  Max  Poly-X  (integer: 
3),  CG  clamp  (integer:  0),  Max  3'  stability  (integer:  9), 
and  Max  Ns  accepted  (integer:  0);  and  (ii)  parameters 
for  individual  sequences,  including  primer  sequence  ID, 
nucleotide  sequence  containing  the  SSR  derived  from 
the  first  step  (SSR  search),  the  SSR  target  region,  and 
the  product  size  range  (minimum:  150  bases).  These  pa-
rameters  have  been  set  as  strict  criteria  to  ensure  ro-
bust  PCR  amplification  in  Brassica  species. 
    SSR-primers  are  designed  from  the  complete  input  by 
PRIMER3,  and  the  resulting  output  (i.e.,  SSR  ID,  PCR 
product  size,  primer  ID,  primer  sequence,  primer  length, 
primer  Tm,  primer  GC%)  is  parsed.  To  increase  the  sta-
bility  of  primers  as  well  as  PCR  efficiency,  primer  pairs 
with  simple  repetitive  DNA  sequences  are  filtered  from 
the  full  list  of  primer  sets,  and  similarly,  cross-homolo-
gous  primer  pairs  showing  high  sequence  similarity  (i.e., 
≥90%)  between  different  primer  pairs  are  also  filtered 
out.  However,  if  one  of  such  a  pair  of  primers  is  unique, 
the  pair  is  not  removed  from  the  full  list  of  primer  sets, 
because  it  may  bring  about  specific  amplification  in  a 
given  template.

Homology-based  search  for  in  silico  amplicons 

The  resulting  in silico  amplicons  (SSR  PCR  products) 
can  be  selectively  searched  against  NCBI  non-re-
dundant  protein  sequence  database  by  using  BLASTX, 
with  adjustment  of  cutoff E-value  (i.e.,  1E-20),  and  best 
BLAST  hit  for  each  amplicon  is  parsed  (i.e.,  score,

E-value,  description,  and  alignment  result).  This  analysis 
provides information whether the SSR amplicons are asso-
ciated  with  protein-coding  regions.  Selectively,  the  use  of 
nucleotide  sequence  database,  including  promoters,  5'-/ 
3'-UTRs,  exons,  and  introns,  with  BLASTN  enable  to  ana-
lyze the genomic feature for amplicons. However, this step 
will  be  available  with  an  administration  authorization  after 
local  installation  of  SSRPG  because  of  dependence  on 
server performance. A source code for SSR-Primer Genera-
tor is also available from the authors upon request (yplim@ 
cnu.ac.kr).

Additional  options 

To  produce  SSR-primers  from  unique,  contiguous  tran-
script  sequence  data,  ESTs  can  be  clustered  and  as-
sembled  by  TGICL  (Pertea et al.,  2003),  and  the  result-
ing  contig  and  singleton  sequences  can  then  be  used 
as  a  query  for  the  analysis  process  in  SSRPG.
    As  another  option,  redundancy  between  different  pri-
mer  datasets  that  have  been  generated  in  different  work 
flows  can  be  assessed.  This  process  would  prevent  du-
plication  in  primer  orders  when  primers  are  derived  from 
the  same  DNA  region.

Data  visualization 

After  completion  of  each  process,  the  corresponding  da-
ta  on  SSRs,  SSR-primers,  and  BLAST  search  are  visua-
lized  in  HTML  format  and  can  be  downloaded  as  a 
tab-delimited  text  file.  In  particular,  because  the  results 
are  cross-linked  to  each  other,  co-visualization  of  differ-
ent  data  is  allowed  in  HTML  format.  All  results  produced 
from  each  process  are  also  stored  into  a  MySQL 
database.

Implementation 

SSRPG  is  supported  on  Linux  and  on  Java  Virtual 
Machine  (JVM)  operating  systems.  The  programs  (i.e., 
SPUTNIK,  PRIMER3,  BLAST,  and  Python  scripts  for  da-
ta  parsing  and  filtering),  which  make  up  the  analysis 
pipeline  shown  in  Fig.  1,  are  batch-processed  with  sup-
porting  of  JSP  programming.  Data  processing  and  input 
and  output  services  are  implemented  as  servlets  running 
in  an  Apache  Tomcat  container  on  a  Webserver.  A 
MySQL  database  is  also  used  to  manage  data  that  are 
produced  during  corresponding  analysis  processes.

format  DNA  sequences;  (ii)  it  provides  ease  of  use 
through  access  to  the  web;  (iii)  it  allows  batch  process-
ing  of  the  analysis  pipeline;  (iv)  it  allows  extra-process-
ing  for  increasing  the  stability  of  primers  (filtering  of  pri-
mer  sets  with  repeat  sequences  and  with  cross-homol-
ogy  between  different  data  sets);  and  (v)  it  allows 
cross-linking  between  different  results  in  HTML-based 
tabular  format  (viz.,  data  integration).  Moreover,  homol-
ogy-based  search  for in silico  amplicons  would  be  help-
ful  to  develop  SSR  markers  linked  to  genes.  Such  an 
approach  also  enables  one  to  identify  marker  trans-
ferability  between  closely  related  genomes  by  compar-
ing  amplicons  to  other  related  genomic  sequences.

Performance  Testing  of  SSRPG

For  performance  testing  of  SSRPG,  197,047  genomic 
survey  sequences  (GSSs)  and  148,391  expressed  se-
quence  tag  (EST)  sequences  of Brassica rapa ssp. peki-
nensis  were  processed  in  SSRPG.  In  particular,  ESTs 
were  initially  clustered  and  assembled  by  TGICL,  and  a 
total  of  16,834  unique  sequences  were  analyzed.  Based 
on  the  type  of  primary  SSR  motif,  a  total  of  29,245  and 
4,101  SSRs  were  found  in  the  GSS  and  EST  datasets, 
respectively,  and  of  those  SSRs  found,  10%  for  GSS 
and  17%  for  EST  were  finally  designed  as  SSR-primer 
pairs  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  use  of  stringent  parame-
ters  for  primer  design  as  well  as  the  filtration  process 
that  removes  the  primer  pairs  having  simple  repetitive 
DNA  sequences  and/or  showing  cross-homology  with 
high  sequence  similarity,  those  SSR-primers  will  enable 
robust  PCR  amplification.  To  test  the  utility  of  SSR-pri-
mers  designed,  we  performed  the  PCR  assay  with  150 
and  114  sampled  GSS-  and  EST-derived  primer  sets, 
respectively.  The  resulting  assay  revealed  a  high  suc-
cess  rate  of  PCR  amplification  (98.7%  for  GSS  and 
95.6%  for  EST)  (Table  1).  Moreover,  clear  single  ampli-
con  was  observed  in  the  assay  regardless  of  repeat 
types  (data  not  shown).  This  result  supports  that  SSRPG 
produces  SSR-primers  with  high  specificity  and  stability 
for  PCR.  Additionally,  in  the  primer  design,  SSRs  with  C 
or  G-containing  motif  (i.e.,  AC,  AAG,  ATC,  AAC,  AGG, 
AGC,  ACT,  CCG,  AAAG  motifs)  showed  relatively  high 
success  rate  comparing  to  those  with  AT-rich  motif  (i.e., 
AT,  AAT,  and  AAAT  motifs)  (Table  1).  This  suggests  that 
the  degree  of  GC  content  as  well  as  low  complexity  in 
SSRs  and  their  flanking  regions  affect  the  determination 
of  target  regions  for  SSR-primer  design.
