Abstract

Epigallocatechin  gallate  (EGCG),  a  well-known  anti-
oxidant  molecule,  has  been  reported  to  cause  hep-
atotoxicity  when  used  in  excess.  However,  the  mecha-
nism  underlying  EGCG-induced  hepatotoxicity  is  still 
unclear.  To  better  understand  the  mode  of  action  of 
EGCG-induced  hepatotoxicity,  we  examined  the  effect 
of  EGCG  on  human  hepatic  gene  expression  in  HepG2 
cells  using  microarrays.  Analyses  of  microarray  data  re-
vealed  more  than  1300  differentially  expressed  genes 
with  a  variety  of  biological  processes.  Upregulated 
genes  showed  a  primary  involvement  with  protein-re-
lated  biological  processes,  such  as  protein  synthesis, 
protein  modification,  and  protein  trafficking,  while  down-
regulated  genes  demonstrated  a  strong  association  with 
lipid  transport.  Genes  involved  in  cellular  stress  re-
sponses  were  highly  upregulated  by  EGCG  treatment,  in 
particular  genes  involved  in  endoplasmic  reticulum  (ER) 
stress,  such  as  GADD153,  GADD34,  and  ATF3.  In  addi-
tion,  changes  in  genes  responsible  for  cholesterol  syn-
thesis  and  lipid  transport  were  also  observed,  which  ex-
plains  the  high  accumulation  of  EGCG-induced  lipids. 
We  also  identified  other  regulatory  genes  that  might  aid 
in  clarifying 
the  molecular  mechanism  underlying 
EGCG-induced  hepatotoxicity.

leaves  of  Camellia sinensis  and  contains  several  poly-
phenolic  components,  such  as  catechin,  epicatechin, 
epicatechin  gallate  (ECG),  epigallocatechin  (EGC),  and 
epigallocatechin  gallate  (EGCG).
    In  addition  to  its  prominent  role  as  a  common  bever-
age,  green  tea  has  demonstrated  profound  biochemical 
and  pharmacological  activities,  including  antioxidative 
activities  and  anti-inflammatory  and  anticarcinogenic 
properties  (Isbrucker et al.,  2006).  The  beneficial  effects 
of  green  tea  on  health  have  been  backed  by  multiple 
scientific  reports,  which  have  proposed  the  involvement 
of  green  tea  in  various  biological  processes,  such  as  in-
hibition  of:  telomerase,  mitogen-activated  protein  kinase 
(MAPK),  activator  protein-1,  nuclear  factor  (NF)-kB,  bind-
ing  of  epidermal  growth  factor  to  its  receptor,  angio-
genesis,  and  activation  of  apoptosis  (Vittal et al.,  2004).
    However,  it  is  becoming  more  apparent  that  green  tea 
compounds  might  also  cause  deleterious  effects  at 
pharmacological  concentrations  in  certain  cases  (Lam-
bert  et al.,  2007).  For  example,  in  France  and  Spain, 
cases  of  hepatic  attack  have  been  reported  after  the 
use  of  hydroalcoholic  extracts  of  green  tea  as  a  com-
plement  of  diets.  These  observations  have  led  to  the 
suspension  of  marketing  authorization  of  these  products 
in  both  countries.  In  animal  models,  EGCG  causes  a 
high  mortality  rate  in  adult  female  Swiss  Webster  mice 
and  hepatotoxicity  in  immature  C57BL/6  female  mice 
(Galati  et al.,  2006;  Goodin  and  Rosengren,  2003). 
Additionally,  recent  studies  have  shown  that  several 
phenolic  antioxidant  food  additives  can  accelerate  oxi-
dative  damage  to  DNA,  proteins,  and  carbohydrates, 
despite  their  antioxidative  action.  The  molecular  mecha-
nism  of  prooxidative  action  and  hepatotoxicity  that  are 
induced  by  EGCG  remains  poorly  understood.  Galati et 
al.  (2006)  reported  that  cell  death  induced  by  EGCG 
was  associated  with  increased  production  of  reactive 
oxygen  species  (ROS)  and  depletion  of  reduced  gluta-
thione  (GSH)  and  catechol-o-methyltransferase  (COMT). 
The  mechanism  of  EGCG-induced  cell  death  was  sug-
gested  in  previous  reports,  which  implicated  the  apopto-
sis  pathway  (Schmidt et al.  2005)  and  the  endoplasmic 
reticulum  (ER)  stress-related  pathway  (Dodo et al.,  2008). 
    To  gain  insight  into  the  molecular  mechanism  under-
lying  EGCG-induced  cytotoxicity,  we  used  a  microarray 
approach,  which  allowed  us  to  observe  the  global  ef-
fects  of  EGCG  on  hepatic  gene  expression.  Time  course

observations  of  the  gene  expression  profile  were  made. 
We  propose  in  the  present  study  that  hepatic  cell  death 
resulting  from  high-concentration  EGCG  treatment  is 
mainly  caused  by  ER  stress.

Methods

Chemicals

EGCG  was  purchased  from  Sigma  (St.  Louis,  MO,  USA). 
DMEM,  fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS),  penicillin/streptomycin, 
TRIzol,  and  DEPC-treated  water  were  obtained  from 
Invitrogen  (Carlsbad,  CA,  USA).

Cell  culture 

The  HepG2  cell  line  was  cultured  in  DMEM  medium 
supplemented  with  10%  heat-inactivated  FBS,  100  U/ml 
penicillin,  and  100  mg/ml  streptomycin  and  maintained 
in  a  monolayer  culture  at  37oC  in  an  incubator  of  hu-
midified  air  with  5%  CO2.  Subconfluent  cells  (80%)  were 
passaged  with  a  solution  containing  0.05%  trypsin  and 
0.02%  EDTA.

Cell  viability  assay

HepG2  cells  were  treated  with  test  substances  dissolved 
in  10%  DMSO  for  24  h.  After  the  treatment,  cell  viability 
Ⓡ
, 
was  assessed  using  the  resazurin  assay  (CellTiter  Blue
Promega,  Madison,  WI,  USA).  Cells  were  incubated  with 
medium  containing  resazurin.  A  kinetic  assay  of  resor-
ufin,  produced  from  resazurin  by  vital  cells,  was  per-
formed  by  measuring  its  absorbance  (570  nm)  in  a 
SpectraMax  microplate 
(Molecular  Devices, 
Sunnyvale,  CA,  USA).  The  absorbance  at  600  nm  was 
used  as  reference.

RNA  isolation  and  DNA  microarray

Total  RNA  was  extracted  using  Trizol  at  each  time  point 
in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s  procedures.  RNA 
quantification  and  purity  (260/280  ratio)  were  determined 
with  a  UV/VIS  spectrophotometer  (ND-1000,  NanoDrop 
Technologies,  Wilmington,  DE,  USA).
    The  Applied  Biosystems  Human  Genome  Survey 
Arrays  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA), 
which  contain  60-mer  oligonucleotide  probes  represent-
ing  a  set  of  32,878  individual  mouse  genes  and  more 
than  250  control  probes,  were  used  for  differential  gene 
expression  profiles.  Microarray  experiments  were  per-
formed  according  to  the  manufacturer’s  instructions. 
Digoxigenin  (DIG)-UTP-labeled  cRNA  was  generated 
from  5  μg  of  total  RNA  and  amplified  using  a  chem-

iluminescent  reverse  transcription  (RT)  in  vitro  tran-
scription  labeling  kit  (Applied  Biosystems).  Briefly,  each 
microarray  was  prehybridized  in  hybridization  buffer  with 
blocking  reagent  at  55oC  for  1  h.  DIG-labeled  cRNA  tar-
gets  (10μg)  were  fragmented  to  100?400  bp  and  hybri-
dized  with  each  prehybridized  microarray  at  55oC  for  16 
h.  The  arrays  were  washed  with  hybridization  wash  buf-
fer  and  then  with  chemiluminescence  rinse  buffer. 
Chemiluminescent  signals  were  generated  by  incubating 
the  arrays  with  anti-DIG-alkaline  phosphatase  and 
chemiluminescence  substrate.  Images  were  collected  for 
each  microarray  using 
the  1700  Chemiluminescent 
Microarray  Analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems).  Microarray 
images  were  autogridded,  and  the  chemiluminescent 
signals  were  quantified,  corrected  for  background,  spa-
tially  normalized,  and  exported  for  a  quality  report. 
Microarray  data  with  quality  reports  above  the  manu-
facturer's  threshold  were  used  for  further  analysis.

Analysis  of  microarray  expression  data

Signal  intensities  were  imported  into  GenPlex  software 
(Istech  Inc,  Korea),  where  interarray  quantile  normal-
ization  was  performed  in  order  to  minimize  the  effect  of 
external  variables  introduced  into  the  data.  Quality  filter-
ing  of  unreliable  spots  (flag  value＜100  and  S/N＜3) 
was  performed  before  normalization.  Then,  the  ex-
pression  intensities  were  log2-transformed.  Differentially 
expressed  genes  (DEGs)  were  selected  by  one-way 
ANOVA,  and  correction  for  multiple  testing  was  then 
performed  using  Benjamini-Hochberg  multiple  testing  to 
derive  a  false  discovery  rate  estimate  from  the  raw 
p-values.  A  false  discovery  rate  of  1%  was  used  as  a 
cutoff  for  statistical  significance.  We  took  the  average 
value  from  the  gene  expression  ratio  obtained  in  3  or 
more  biological  replicates.
    For  further  analysis,  DEGs  were  divided  into  gene 
clusters  according  to  expression  level  at  each  time 
point.  Hierarchical  clustering  was  applied  to  genes  using 
Euclidean  distance  as  a  similarity  measurement,  as  im-
plemented  in  the  Genesis  software  program  (http:// 
genome.tugraz.at).  Additionally,  DEGs  were  divided  into 
categories  according  to  biological  process  using  the 
PANTHER  (Protein  ANalysis  THrough  Evolutionary  Relat-
ionships)  Protein  Classification  System  (Applied  Biosys-
tems,  https://panther.appliedbiosystems.com).

Semiquantitative and real-time quantitative RT-PCR

For  semiquantitative  and  real-time  quantitative  RT-PCR, 
glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate  dehydrogenase  (GAPDH) 
was  used  as  an  internal  control  with  the  5’-  ccatcat-
gaagtgtgacgttg  -3’  and  5’-  gtgctaggagccagagcagta  -3’ 

primer  set.  For  each  sample,  the  same  total  RNA  used 
for  microarray  hybridization  was  reverse-transcribed  us-
ing  1μM  oligo  (dT)  primer  with  Superscript  Ⅲ reverse 
transcriptase  (Invitrogen).  The  thermal  profiles  consisted 
of  94oC  for  5  min  for  initial  denaturing,  followed  by  25∼
35  cycles  of  94oC  for  30  s,  55∼65oC  for  30  s,  and 
72oC  for  30  s  to  1  min.  All  RT-PCR  reactions  were  re-
peated  at  least  3  times.  Triplicate  real-time  RT-PCR  ex-
periments  were  performed  using  the  MiniOpticon  system 
(Bio-Rad,  Hercules,  CA)  and  the  DyNAmo  Flash  SYBR 
Green  qPCR  kit  (Finnzymes,  Espoo,  Finland).  A  melting 
curve  was  obtained  for  each  PCR  product  after  each 
run  to  confirm  that  the  signal  corresponded  to  a  unique 
amplicon  of  the  product  size.  The  primers  were  5’-  gaa

Statistical  analysis

All  experiments  were  carried  out  3  times.  Results  are 
presented  as  mean  values±SE. 

Results

viability  of  the  cells  but  not  at  higher  concentrations 
(1000-3500  uM).  At  higher  concentrations,  rather,  EGCG 
caused  a  significant  decrease  in  cell  viability  (Fig.  1). 
The  lethal  concentration  30  (LC30)  of  EGCG  against 
HepG2  cells  was  determined  as  850  uM,  according  to 
nonlinear  regression  analysis.  EGCC  at  850  uM  was 
used  for  the  following  experiments.

Cell  viability  following  treatment  with  EGCG

The  effect  of  EGCG  on  HepG2  viability  was  monitored 
by  resazurin  assay,  which  measures  the  reducing  ca-
pacity  of  mitochondria  in  cells.  Based  on  the  cell  via-
bility  assay  results,  it  seemed  that  the  treatment  of 
EGCG  at  low  concentrations  (10-100  uM)  increased  the 

Identification  of  differentially  expressed  genes

Gene  expression  profiling  was  performed  to  examine  the 
temporal  changes  of  gene  expression  in  EGCG-treated 
HepG2  cells.  Total  RNA  was  prepared  from  the  cells 
treated  with  850  uM  of  EGCG  for  6,  12,  24  h,  and  0  h

(the  control).  The  cRNAs  were  subsequently  synthesized 
and  hybridized.  Analyses  revealed  that  EGCG  treatment 
significantly  (p＜0.01)  altered  the  expression  of  1343 
genes  (http://kotis.nifds.go.kr).  Interestingly,  activating 
transcription 
(ATF3)  and  N-myc  down-
stream-regulated  gene  1  (NDRG1)  showed  marked  over-
expression  (more  than  5-fold),  while  inhibitor  of  DNA 
binding  1  (ID1)  revealed  a  drastic  downregulation  (more 
than  10-fold)  by  EGCG  treatment  at  all  3  time  points.

Clustering  and  functional  enrichment  analysis 

To  characterize  patterns  of  transcript  expression  during 
the  time  course,  hierarchical  clustering  was  performed 
on  the  1343  genes,  and  these  genes  were  classified  into 
4  clusters  (Fig.  2A).  The  temporal  cluster  analysis  re-
vealed  4  clusters  of  transcripts  that  were  either  down-
regulated  (cluster  1;  407  genes  and  cluster  2;  336 
genes)  or  upregulated  (cluster  3;  358  genes  and  cluster 
4;  242  genes).  Genes  in  cluster  1  showed  a  trend  of  ex-
pression  that  decreased  up  to  12  h  and  increased 
slightly  at  24  h.  Genes  in  cluster  2  showed  a  gradual 
decrease  up  to  24  h.  On  the  contrary,  genes  in  cluster 
3  showed  overexpression  up  to  12  h  and  slight  under-
expression  at  24  h.  Cluster  4  contained  genes  with 
gradually  increasing  expression  up  to  24  h.

HepG2  cells,  overrepresented  biological  processes  of 
each  cluster  were  identified  using  the  PANTHER  gene 
expression  data  analysis  tool  (Fig.  2B).  According  to  the 
analyses,  biological  processes,  such  as  cell  cycle,  tran-
scription,  nucleic  acid  metabolism,  carbohydrate  metab-
olism,  oncogenesis,  protein  targeting/localization,  and 
cell  proliferation/differentiation,  showed  significant  en-
richment  in  cluster  1,  and  signal  transduction,  cell  com-
munication,  lipid/fatty  acid  transport,  cell  structure  and 
motility,  vitamin/cofactor  transport,  mRNA  splicing,  pro-
tein  phosphorylation,  and  purine  metabolism  were  in 
cluster  2. 
    Clusters  3  and  4  also  revealed  enrichment  of  certain 
biological  processes,  such  as  protein  biosynthesis,  pro-
tein  metabolism  and  modification,  and  B  cell  immunity 
for  cluster  3  and  intracellular  protein  traffic,  vesicle 
transport,  and  amino  acid  metabolism  for  cluster  4.

EGCG  increases  expression  of  genes  related  to 
protein  biosynthesis  and  protein  metabolism/ 
modification 

Treatment  with  EGCG  led  to  elevated  expression  of 
genes  associated  with  protein  biosynthesis  and  protein 
modification  (Table  1),  including  eukaryotic  translation

(DUSPs),  peptidylprolyl 

initiation  factors  (EIFs),  mitochondrial  ribosomal  proteins 
(MRPLs),  ribosomal  proteins  (RPLs),  dual  specificity 
phosphatases 
isomerase  H 
(PPIH),  protein  phosphatase  2A,  regulatory  subunit 
B(PPP2R4),  and  protease,  serine,  21(PRSS21).  Many  of 
these  transcripts  showed  significant  elevation  in  ex-
pression  (more  than  2-fold)  at  12  h. 

Effects  of  EGCG  on  intracellular  protein  traf-
fic-related  genes

Many  genes  related  to  protein  trafficking  were  upregu-
lated  by  EGCG  treatment  (Table  2).  Transcripts  in  this 
biological  process  showed  a  peculiar  increase  in  ex-
pression  at  24  h.  In  particular,  genes  like  choroider-
emia-like  (CHML),  N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive  factor  at-
tachment  protein  gamma  (NAPG),  and  WD  repeat  do-
main  24  (WDR24)  showed  overexpression,  greater  than 
4-fold,  at  24  h. 

EGCG  alters  expression  of  several  genes  related 
to  lipid  metabolism

EGCG  treatment  turned  out  to  cause  underexpression  of 
many  genes  related  to  lipid  metabolism  (Table  3).  The 
expression  of  genes  involved  in  lipid  transport,  including 
caveolin  1  (CAV1),  niemann-pick  disease,  type  C1 
(NPC1),  oxysterol-binding  protein-like  1A  (OSBPL1A), 
and  clusterin  (CLU),  were  downregulated,  as  shown  by 
PANTHER  gene  expression  data  analysis  (Table  1).  In 
particular,  NPC1  has  been  reported  to  be  involved  in 
the  intracellular  trafficking  of  cholesterol  (Pacheco  and 
Lieberman,  2008).  On  the  other  hand,  the  expression  of 
genes  related  to  the  cholesterol  biosynthetic  pathway, 
including  isopentenyl-diphosphate  delta  isomerase  1 
(IDI1),  farnesyl-diphosphate  farnesyltransferase  1  (FDFT1), 
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA  reductase  (HMGCR), 
and  HMG-coenzyme  A  synthase  1  (HMGCS1),  was  up-
regulated  at  24  h  after  EGCG  treatment.  These  ob-
servations  indicate  that  treatment  with  EGCG  induces 
the  synthesis  and  accumulation  of  cholesterol  in  HepG2 
cells.

EGCG  increases  expression  of  cellular  stress 
and  ER  stress  markers 

Treatment  with  EGCG  resulted  in  elevated  expression  of 
cellular  stress  markers,  such  as  transcription  factors, 
markers  of  DNA  damage,  cell  cycle/apoptosis,  and 
genes  associated  with  redox  status  (Table  4).  Of  partic-
ular  note,  3  genes-activating  transcription  factor  3 
(ATF3),  activating  transcription  factor  4  (ATF4),  and 
CCAAT/enhancer  binding  protein 
(C/EBP),  gamma 
(CEBPG)-are  known  to  be  associated  with  ER  stress. 
The  involvement  of  ER  stress  in  EGCG-induced  cytotox-
icity  was  further  monitored  by  real-time  RT-PCR  of  dif-
ferentially  expressed  marker  genes  (Fig.  3).  The  results 
showed  that  ATF3,  which  is  a  member  of  the  ATF/CREB 
subfamily  of  the  basic  region  leucine  zipper  (bZIP)  fam-
ily,  was  increased  by  more  than  8-fold  in  6-h-treated 
cells.  In  addition,  members  of  the  CCAAT/enhancer 
binding  protein  (C/EBP)  family  of  transcription  factors, 

the  apoptosis-inducing  proteins  GADD153 
such  as 
(CHOP)  and  GADD34,  were  also  upregulated 
in 
6-h-treated  cells.  The  expression  of  GADD153  and 
GADD34  was  increased  more  than  2-fold  at  all  time 
points. 
Prolonged  ER  stress  can  perturb  mitochondria,  trigger-
ing  oxidative  stress.  Ca2＋-induced  oxidative  stress  can 
cause  both  cell  death  and  activation  of  NF-кB  signal-
ing  (Ji  and  Kaplowitz,  2006).  In  this  study,  NFKBIE  was 
differentially  expressed  at  6  h  (2.6-fold)  and  12  h 
(2.2-fold),  but  at  24  h  it  was  not  significantly  expressed 
(1.1-fold).  NFKBIE  is  known  as  a  member  of  the  family 
of  NF-κB  inhibitory  proteins  (IκBs)  that  interact  with 
NF-κB  in  unstimulated  cells  (Komissarova et al.,  2008), 

Verification  of  microarray  data

To  verify  the  gene  expression  profiles  from  the  oligonu-
cleotide  microarray,  6  genes  that  showed  significant  up-

104    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  7(2)  97-106,  June  2009

and  calcium  signaling  in  the  normal  physiological  state.
    In  our  study,  EGCG  exposure  to  HepG2  cell  cultures 
resulted  in  a  marked  increase  in  the  mRNA  level  of 
genes  associated  with  protein  synthesis  and  modifi-
cation.  This  is  not  surprising,  because  repairing  hepatic 
damage  requires  the  massive  production  of  new  pro-
teins  and  modification  of  proteins.  EGCG  treatment  also 
revealed  upregulation  of  many  genes  involved  in  protein 
secretion,  including  intracellular  protein  trafficking.  These 
expression  patterns  were  consistent  with  those  of  pyr-
azole,  a  known  inducer  of  ER  stress  (Nichols  and  Kirby, 
2008).
    EGCG-induced  upregulation  of  GADD34,  GADD153, 
and  ATF3  provides  genetic  evidence  for  the  presence  of 
EGCG-caused  ER  stress.  Even  though  GADD153,  a 
member  of  the  C/EBP  gene  family  of  transcription  fac-
tors,  has  already  been  reported  to  be  induced  by 
growth  arrest,  DNA  damage,  or  UV  irradiation,  recent 
studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  gene  also  has  great 
responsivity  to  ER  stress  (Outinen et al.,  1999;  Wang et 
al.,  1996).  In  addition,  it  has  previously  been  shown  that 
GADD153  induces  cell  death  by  promoting  protein  syn-
thesis  and  oxidation  in  the  stressed  endoplasmic  retic-
ulum  (Marciniak et al.,  2004).  The  transcription  of  ATF3 
usually  increases  within  2  h  from  stress  exposure,  and 
ATF3  protein  can  function  as  a  homodimer  or  as  a 
member  of  the  complex  of  the  CCAAT/enhancer  binding 
protein  (C/EBP)  family  of  transcription  factor,  such  as 
GADD153.  Jiang et al.  (2003)  also  found  that  ATF3  is  in-
duced  in  response  to  ER  stress.  GADD34  encodes  a 
regulatory  subunit  of  an  eIF2α-directed-phosphatase 
complex  that  promotes  the  recovery  of  protein  synthesis 
in  cells  exposed  to  ER  stress,  causing  more  ER  stress 
(Lai  et al.,  2007). 
    In  addition  to  genes  related  to  ER  stress,  apopto-
sis-related  genes,  like  BNIP3  and  BNIP3L,  were  also  up-
regulated  around  2-fold  after  12  h  and  around  4-fold  af-
ter  24  h  of  EGCG  treatment  in  HepG2  cells.  According 
to  a  previous  report,  induction  of  BNIP3  localized  itself 
to  mitochondria  and  triggered  a  loss  of  membrane  po-
tential  and  an  increase  in  reactive  oxygen  species  pro-
duction,  which  often  lead  to  cell  death  (Burton  and 
Gibson,  2009).  These  results  imply  that  EGCG  exposure 
to  HepG2  cells 
induces  BNIP-mediated  apoptosis 
through  disturbances  of  ER  functions. 
    There  have  been  various  studies  to  elucidate  the  mo-
lecular  mechanism  of  EGCG  activity.  Although  some 
EGCG-interacting  molecules  have  been  identified,  the 
molecular  mechanism  of  its  cytotoxic  activity  is  not  yet 
fully  clarified.  Recently,  Kuzuhara  et al.  (2006)  reported 
that  EGCG  and  its  related  derivatives  that  have  a  galloyl 
group  interacted  with  DNA  and  RNA  directly,  while  cat-
echin  and  its  related  derivatives,  lacking  a  galloyl  group,

each  time  point  and  represents  the  mean±SEM  of  3  in-

to  semi-

tern  assayed  by  microarray  (Fig.  3).

Discussion

The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  effects 
of  EGCG  on  hepatic  gene  expression  and  to  understand 
the  underlying  mechanism  of  hepatotoxicity  for  this  pol-
yphenol  in  vitro.  Our  study  revealed  that  high  concen-
trations  of  EGCG  affected  the  expression  of  a  large 
number  of  genes  in  various  cellular  pathways  (1343 
genes).  The  functional  enrichment  analysis  of  the  differ-
entially  expressed  genes  provided  new  insight  into  the 
molecular  mechanism  of  EGCG  for  its  undesirable 
effect. 
    We  showed  that  high  concentrations  of  EGCG  acti-
vate  the  unfolded  protein  response  (UPR),  resulting  in 
increased  expression  of  ER  stress  response  genes  in 
cultured  human  HepG2  cells.  ER  not  only  is  the  place 
of  protein  synthesis  and  package;  it  also  plays  a  central 
role  in  various  signaling  pathways.  Dysfunction  of  the 
ER  can  be  induced  by  various  biological  disturbances, 
so-called  ER  stress.  UPR  is  one  of  the  well-known  ER 
stresses,  and  it  may  be  associated  with  cellular  apopto-
sis  in  HepG2  cells.  The  UPR  is  reported  to  be  required 
for  safe-guarding  protein  synthesis,  post-translational 
modifications,  folding  and  secretion,  calcium  storage, 

did  not  interact  with  DNA  or  RNA.  On  the  other  hand, 
Ermakova  et al.  (2006)  reported  that  glucose-regulating 
protein  78  (GRP78),  a  molecular  chaperone  in  the  ER,  is 
an  EGCG-binding  protein.  In  the  report,  EGCG  and  cat-
echins,  containing  a  galloyl  group,  showed  stronger  in-
hibition  of  GRP78  than  EC,  EGC,  and  catechins  that 
lacked  a  galloyl  group.  This  observation  strongly  sup-
ports  the  existence  of  an  interaction  between  the  galloyl 
group  and  GRP78. 
    ER  stress  contributes  to  intracellular  lipid  accumu-
lation,  which  is  mediated  by  ER-associated  trans-
membrane  sterol  response  element-binding  protein  1 
(SREBP1),  an  ER  membrane-bound  transcription  factor. 
SREBP1  activates  genes  encoding  enzymes  in  the  cho-
lesterol/triglyceride  biosynthesis  and  uptake  pathway  (Ji 
and  Kaplowitz,  2006).  The  present  study  showed  that 
EGCG-induced  ER  stress  increased  the  expression  of 
genes  responsible  for  cholesterol/triglyceride  biosyn-
thesis,  including  HMGCR  and  HMGCS1,  and  decreased 
the  expression  of  genes  responsible  for  lipid  transport, 
including  CAV1,  NPC1,  OSBPL1A,  and  CLU.  Interesting-
ly,  clusterin  (CLU),  a  multifunctional  heterodimeric  glyco-
protein,  is  known  for  its  implication  in  a  wide  range  of 
physiological  functions,  such  as  lipid  transport,  tissue 
repair  and  remodeling,  membrane  protection,  and  pro-
motion  of  cell  interaction.  It  has  been  reported  that  in-
duction  of  clusterin  may  represent  a  protective  response 
against  oxidative  stress  (Shannan et al.,  2006).  More  re-
cently,  clusterin  has  been  proposed  as  a  candidate  bio-
marker  for  kidney  injury  (Sieber  et al.,  2009). 
    Based  on  the  analyses  of  the  presented  microarray 
data,  it  seems  clear  that  high  concentrations  of  EGCG 
cause  cell  death,  probably  via  the  apoptosis  pathway, 
by  inducing  ER  stress  and  the  expression  of  ER  stress 
response  genes  (GADD153,  GADD34,  and  ATF3).  The 
presented  results  strongly  suggest  that  high  concen-
trations  of  EGCG  might  cause  fatty  liver  through  ER 
stress-induced  accumulation  of  lipids  in  living  subjects. 
The  identification  of  other  regulatory  genes  may  also  aid 
in  clarifying 
the  molecular  mechanism  underlying 
EGCG-induced  hepatotoxicity.
