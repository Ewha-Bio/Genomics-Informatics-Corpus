Kimchi is a traditional Korean food prepared by fermenting vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage and radishes, which are 
seasoned with various ingredients, including red pepper powder, garlic, ginger, green onion, fermented seafood (Jeotgal), 
and salt. The various unique microorganisms and bioactive components in kimchi show antioxidant activity and have been 
associated with an enhanced immune response, as well as anti-cancer and anti-diabetic effects. Red pepper inhibits decay 
due to microorganisms and prevents food from spoiling. The vast amount of biological information generated by academic 
and industrial research groups is reflected in a rapidly growing body of scientific literature and expanding data resources. 
However, the genome, biological pathway, and related disease data are insufficient to explain the health benefits of kimchi 
because of the varied and heterogeneous data types. Therefore, we have constructed an appropriate semantic data model 
based on an integrated food knowledge database and analyzed the functional and biological processes associated with 
kimchi in silico. This complex semantic network of several entities and connections was generalized to answer complex 
questions, and we demonstrated how specific disease pathways are related to kimchi consumption.

Introduction

Kimchi is a salty, fermented preparation of cabbage that is 
widely  consumed  in  the  traditional  Korean  diet.  Certain 
types of kimchi are prepared by mixing salted cabbage with 
spicy  ingredients,  such  as  red  pepper  powder,  garlic,  and 
ginger, while others are prepared without red chili pepper or 
are soaked in a savory liquid. Kimchi is prepared by mixing 
cabbage well with other vegetables, fish seasoning, and salt, 
and packing it into jars. The various unique microorganisms 
[1] and bioactive components present in kimchi have shown 
antioxidant  activity  and  have  been  associated  with  an 
enhanced  immune  response,  as  well  as  anti-cancer  and 
anti-diabetic  effects.  For  example,  components  produced 
during the fermentation process show anti-cancer effects via 
the inhibition of the Ras oncogene signaling pathway [2], 
and anti-atherosclerotic effects are seen via a reduction in 
low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol oxidation [3-6]. During 

the  fermentation  process,  bacteria  in  the  environment, 
predominantly from the genera Lactobacilli, Leuconostoc, and 
Weissella, produce byproducts that contribute to the pungent 
flavor of kimchi and include beneficial bioactive compounds 
[7, 8]. 

In  particular,  the  red  chili  pepper,  the  component  of 
kimchi that makes it spicy, is a potent antioxidant due to its 
high vitamin C levels and capsaicin content. Furthermore, 
red  pepper  inhibits  the  decay  of  microorganisms  and 
prevents  food  from  spoiling.  The  physiological  effects  of 
kimchi thus originate from bioactive compounds present in 
its ingredients, and the functions of these are amplified by 
the fermentation process. Therefore, the health-promoting, 
probiotic, and functional properties  of  kimchi can  be  op-
timized by manipulating the types and amounts of ingre-
dients,  and  by  using  appropriate  probiotic  starters  and 
kimchi preparation methods such as fermentation. Optimally 
produced kimchi can be a very healthy food [9].

However, the available genome, biological pathway, and 
related disease data are still insufficient to explain the health 
benefits of kimchi. An integrated database of these data is 
not  available,  because  it  is  difficult  to  control  for  the 
heterogeneous data types. Furthermore, biological processes 
are interrelated on many levels and their regulation presents 
complexity. These interactions must be understood in detail 
to successfully manage risks in the development of biological 
products. Evidence-based information on kimchi should be 
provided  by  both  public  and  proprietary  information 
sources,  including  public  databases,  experimental  results 
from  individual  studies,  text-mining  analyses,  and  know-
ledge management systems. The model integrating this data 
would represent the accumulated knowledge in this domain 
that could be browsed and mined interactively. In this study, 
we have constructed the proper semantic data model and 
extracted  integrated  information  on  kimchi's  nutritional 
content, and its effects on physiology and disease, based on 
analyses of the functional and biological characteristics of 
kimchi in the scientific literature.

Methods
Semantic modeling 

We used a semantic tool for knowledge base management, 
BioXM  (Biomax  Information  AG,  Munchen,  Germany), 
which was developed for object-oriented semantic integra-
tion. In this approach, semantically identical objects and the 
associations between them are identified and mapped based 
on  data  and  descriptive  meta-information  [10].  This  pri-
marily involves the mapping of biological objects and des-
criptive data from literature to common objects like genes, 
diseases,  or  chemical.  Associations  between  entities  are 
mapped  as  relations  (e.g.,  chemical  X  is  associated  with 
disease A) and object relation information is contextually 
structured (e.g., gene B is regulated negatively/positively by 
chemical X). Using objects as nodes and relations as edges, 
a “semantic network” can be generated that provides infor-
mation on the connections between participating objects. 
Various elementary concepts, such as elements, relations, 
and annotations, are defined in Fig. 1 and the study workflow 
is illustrated in Fig. 2. We modified this complex semantic

complex questions, as is shown in Fig. 3. To access the data 
easily,  we  used  the  BioXM  tool,  which  provides  visual 
browsing of the knowledge network (Fig. 3), as well as data 

mapping and query wizards (Fig. 4) that automatically adapt 
to the changes of a given data model. This system enabled us 
to create knowledge networks with flexible workflows for 
handling data and information types.

Data collection by text-mining and data analysis 

Pathway Studio software 9.0 (Elsevier, Atlanta, GA, USA) 
was used to collect information on biological processes and 
diseases  related  to  kimchi,  based  on  information  in  the 
Korean Food Standard Reference (KFSR). Pathway Studio 
software allows the automatic extraction of regulatory and 
physical  interactions  from  MEDLINE  abstracts  using  a 
natural-language-processing  technology  called  MedScan 
[11]. Interactions extracted by MedScan, which contain a 
formalized  set  of  relationships,  are  imported  into  the 
Pathway  Studio  database  and  analyzed  further  using 
data-mining  tools  for  knowledge  inference  [12].  Since 
MedScan  keeps  the  reference  of  the  original  article  with 
information  on  the  extracted  interaction,  it  also  allows  a 

quick review of extracted facts and identification of relevant 
publications. Thus, it facilitated our pathway reconstruction 
by  selecting  the  appropriate  interactions.  All  interactions 
found  were  manually  curated,  and  only  validated  inte-
ractions were included in the pathways.

Results
Semantic data modeling

Elements and relations were maintained and linked by 
relation and object. This semantic model enabled elements 
to  be  mapped  to  known  elements.  Relations  between 
biological data are used to efficiently extract interactions of 
interest.  The  semantic  modeling  in  this  study  was  con-
figured in the generic BioXM knowledge management en-

vironment to create a knowledge base for this translational 
systems  biology  approach.  We  constructed  semantic  net-
works for the discovery of a network biomarker using BioXM 
software (Biomax Information AG), which is a customizable 
knowledge base management tool for scientific data. The 
graphical data model is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Table 1, 
we created elements such as “Foods,” “Foods Group,” “Food 
Name,” “Metabolites,” and nine other elements to describe 
the  available  biological  knowledge.  Information  on  the 
interconnection of elements is captured in relations such as 
“is related to” for “Foods” or “regulates” for a metabolite 
that regulates expression of a gene. This network consisted 
of  13  elements  and  20  relations.  The  semantic  network 
provided  information  on  connections  between  included 
objects instantly. Therefore, this integrated semantic data 
model was used to create new knowledge networks with 
flexible workflows.

Data configuration

This  semantic  model  enabled  us  to  integrate  existing 
public  databases  and  experimental  data  derived  from  the 
literature. To populate the knowledge base with data from 
public databases, we manually generated mappings in imp-
ort-templates. A graphical wizard for import-template gene-
ration provided a selection of possible import options and 
mappings.

Construction of the KFSR

The  United  States  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA) 
food and nutrient databases provide the basic infrastructure 
for food and nutrition research, nutrition monitoring, policy, 
and dietary practice. The databases date back to 1892 and 
they are unique, as the only databases available in the public 
domain  that  perform  these  functions.  The  Nutrient  Data 
Laboratory  develops  and  maintains  the  USDA  Standard 
Reference  and  related  data  products  [13].  The  Standard 
Reference is the major source of food composition data in the 
United  States.  It  provides  the  foundation  for  most  food 
composition databases used in food policy, research, dietary 
practice,  and  nutrition  monitoring.  The  USDA  databases 
were used to construct the KFSR. This product is the basis of 
numerous other applications that address nutrients in foods. 
The  database  contains 
information  on  agricultural 
commodities, as well as data on formulated and processed 
foods. Currently, the database contains values for up to 140 
different  food  components,  including  nitrogen  (protein), 
total fat, carbohydrates, and moisture, as well as individual 
fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals in ＞7,500 
foods.  We  have  added  five  traditional  Korean  foods,  i.e., 
kimchi,  bulgogi,  bibimbap,  doenjang,  and  gochujang.  To 
construct a useful KFSR, we integrated 11 public databases 
as shown in Table 2, with a total of 26,848,859 records.

Data analysis of kimchi from the knowledge base

We  found a total 4,351 genes strongly associated with 
kimchi's secondary metabolites using the KFSR, as shown in 
Fig. 3. First, 1,237 kimchi metabolites were extracted form 
＞7,500 foods in KFSR and 4,351 genes were associated with 
1,237 kimchi metabolites. Through the semantically integ-
rated  datasets,  we  discovered  genes  that  were  associated 
with kimchi metabolites. This network is shown in Fig. 4. 
We  used  the  Kyoto  Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes 
(KEGG) pathway to classify genes by metabolic function. 
The genes in Table 3 are classified into six categories, and 
309  of  these  genes  were  found  to  be  involved  in  lipid 
metabolism. At first, we initiated a cardiovascular disease 
network analysis related to kimchi using 30 genes. Of these, 
27  were  directly  connected  by  interactions  such  as 
regulation,  promoter  binding,  direct  regulation,  protein 
modification,  and  miRNA  regulation.  Genes  like  ADCY5, 
ADCY1, ADCY2, GNAS, CTNNB1, EDN1, and RAC1 were the 
most highly connected nodes with node degrees of ≥10 (p < 
0.001)  (Fig.  5A).  Adenyl  cyclases  (ADCYs)  are  critical 
regulators  of  metabolic  and  cardiovascular  function,  and 
ADCY5 is increased in hearts with pressure-overloaded left 
ventricular  hypertrophy  [14,  15].  In  addition,  guanine 
nucleotide-binding  protein  Gs  (GNAS)  overexpression 
results in increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimulation and 
cardiomyopathy  [16],  as  shown  in  Fig.  4A.  In  addition, 
GNAS leads to the activation of β-catenin which is a mul-
tifunctional  protein  coded  by  the  CNNB1  gene.  Although 
there has long been speculation on the association between 
kimchi and heart disease, Lee et al. [16] demonstrated that 
kimchi may not adversely affect blood pressure and cardiac 
function.

Kimchi is effective in enhancing immune function [3, 18, 
19]; however, the scientific evidence to support this claim 
has been insufficient. In this work, we performed an immune 
disease network analysis related to kimchi, based on public 
information  and  using  39  selected  genes.  Twenty-three 
genes were directly connected to each other by interactions 
such  as  regulation,  promoter  binding,  direct  regulation, 
protein modification, and miRNA regulation. In particular, 
PTPRC, LCK, JAK3, ZAP70, and VEGFA were the most highly 
connected nodes with node degrees of ≥7 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 
5B). Specifically, PTPRC and JAK3 were found to regulate 
innate immune responses [20-22]. This analytic information 
database, the KFSR, may suggest ways to analyze and more 
effectively use existing scientific data.

Discussion

For a long time, many nutritionists have believed, based 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  4,  2016

on  metabolomics  data,  that  well-fermented  kimchi  has 
numerous anti-biotic activities [23, 24]. Recently, this has 
led to a significant increase in kimchi export. Kimchi has 
gradually gained popularity, even among foreigners, and it 
has  become  a  globally  recognized  food.  However,  the 
genome, biological pathway, and related disease data are still

insufficient to explain the health benefits of kimchi. The-
refore, we investigated, in silico, a kimchi network based on 
public  information  using  network-based  systems  biology 
tools,  including  BioXM  and  Pathway  Studio.  The  in  silico 
network data used in our study were based on published 
literature. With a long-term aim to search for the metabolic 
pathways affected by kimchi and kimchi’s effects on various 
diseases,  we  first  re-analyzed  the  data  for  better  compa-
rability. Then, a number of specific biomolecular networks 
for kimchi were built in various ways. Genes analyzed in 
Pathway  Studio  were  shown  to  be  key  players  in  various 
cellular pathways and mechanisms, such as inflammation, 
cell proliferation, and immunity, which could be altered by 
underlying causes, such as disease Moreover, these biological 
processes were also related to obesity. This interpretation 
supports  the  view  that  there  are  common,  underlying 
markers for targeted biological processes. Our results should 
be considered only the initial effort in understanding the 
interrelated characteristics of the highly complex metabolic 
pathway of kimchi. Experimental studies will also be needed 
to verify this in silico kimchi network.
