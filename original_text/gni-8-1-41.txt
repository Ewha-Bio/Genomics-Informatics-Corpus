Abstract

Statins  are  competitive  inhibitors  of  hydroxy-3-methyl 
glutaryl  coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  and  used 
most  frequently  to  reduce  plasma  cholesterol  levels  and 
to  decrease  cardiovascular  events.  However,  statins  al-
so  have  been  reported  to  have  undesirable  side  effects 
such  as  myotoxicity  and  hepatotoxicity  associated  with 
their  intrinsic  efficacy  mechanisms.  Clinical  studies  re-
currently  reported  that  statin  therapy  elevated  the  level 
of  liver  enzymes  such  as  ALT  and  AST  in  patients  sug-
gesting  possible  liver  toxicity  due  to  statins.  This  ob-
servation  has  been  drawn  great  attention  since  statins 
are  the  most  prescribed  drugs  and  statin-therapy  was 
extended  to  a  larger  number  of  high-risk  patients.  Here 
we  employed  rat  primary  hepatocytes  and  microarray 
technique  to  understand  underlying  mechanism  respon-
sible  for  statin-induced  liver  toxicity  on  cell  level.  We 
isolated  genes  whose  expressions  were  commonly 
modulated  by  statin  treatments  and  examined  their  bio-
logical  functions.  It  is  of  interest  that  those  genes  have 
function  related  to  response  to  stress  in  particular  im-
munity  and  defense  in  cells.  Our  study  provided  the  ba-
sic  information  on  cellular  mechanism  of  statin-induced 
cytotoxicity  and  may  serve  for  finding  indicator  genes  of 
statin  -induced  toxicity  in  rat  primary  hepatocytes.

Introduction

Statins  are  competitive  hydroxy-3-methyl  glutaryl  coen-
zyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  inhibitors  that  inhibit  the 
synthesis  of  cholesterol  from  mevalonic  acid  and  the 
drugs  most  frequently  used  to  reduce  plasma  cholester-

ol  levels  and  decrease  cardiovascular  events  (Abu et al., 
2005).  However,  the  side  effects  associated  with  the  use 
of  statins  have  been  highlighted  by  the  withdrawal  of 
cerivastatin  from  the  market  in  2001  (Baycol  website) 
due  to  its  causing  a  relatively  high  incidence  of  myo-
pathy  and  rhabdomyolysis  (Yamazaki  et al.,  2006). 
    Together  with  myotoxicity,  there  have  been  lingering 
concerns  regarding  statin-induced  hepatotoxicity  from 
the  time  of  introduction  of  lovastatin  in  1987,  the  first 
member  of  the  class.  Millions  of  patients  have  now  re-
ceived  these  drugs.  Asymptomatic  increases  in  amino-
transferase  levels  develop  frequently  (Maddrey  et al., 
2005).  Since  statins  inhibit  cholesterol  synthesis  in  the 
liver  much  more  than  in  any  other  tissue,  it  is  not  sur-
prising  that  elevations  in  the  liver  enzymes  ALT  and  AST 
have  been  noted  since  the  first  clinical  trial  with  lova-
statin  (Hamelin et al.,  1998).  In  the  case  of  statin  ther-
apy,  four  types  of  hepatic  syndromes  need  to  be  con-
sidered;  acute  liver  failure,  hepatitis,  cholestasis  and 
transaminitis.  Initial  toxicology  studies  in  animals  sug-
gested  that  statins  may  cause  significant  liver  problems. 
Although  the  usual  doses  of  lovastatin  did  not  cause 
significant  liver  injury,  when  given  in  very  high  dose  they 
caused  hepatocellular  necrosis  in  rabbits  (Chalasani,et 
al.,  2005).  Similarly,  high  doses  of  simvastatin  caused 
hepatocellular  necrosis  in  guinea  pig  (Chalasani  et al., 
2005).  The  liver  injury  in  these  animals  could  be  pre-
vented  or  reversed  with  supplementing  animals  with  me-
valonate  suggesting  that  depletion  of  mevalonate  or  its 
down-stream  metabolite  might  be  responsible  for  liver 
injury  (Chalasani  et al.,  2005).
    According  to  adverse  effect  reports,  it  seemed  that  all 
of  these  hepatic  adverse  effects  do  not  have  any  sig-
nificant  increase  with  statin  therapy  (Abu,  et al.,  2005). 
However,  as  the  use  of  lipid  lowering  treatment  includ-
ing  statins  was  extended  to  a  larger  number  of  high-risk 
patients,  the  potential  of  statin-induced  liver  toxicity  be-
came  a  major  concern  for  the  safety  profile  of  statins. 
Moreover,  a  large-scale  clinical  study  encouraged  the 
use  of  statins  in  a  wide  range  of  patients  at  varying  lev-
els  of  risk  for  cardiovascular  events  and  independently 
of  baseline  cholesterol  levels  (Heart  Protection  Study, 
2002,  Wilmshurst  et al.,  2002). 
    Taken  together,  it  seemed  that  the  most  concerning 
issue  for  statin  safety  resides  its  potential  to  cause 
acute  liver  failure  during  wide  use  of  cholesterol  low-
ering  therapy.  To  address  this  concern,  it  would  be 
helpful  to  understand  underlying  mechanism  of  statin-in-

duced  toxicity  using  a  commonly  used  system.  In  the 
presented  work,  rat  primary  hepatocytes  were  used  as 
a  model  system  to  assess  statin-induced  toxicity  by 
combining  microarray  technique.  This  effort  will  provide 
deeper  knowledge  of  the  mechanisms  responsible  for 
the  toxic  effects  of  statins  along  with  putative  indicator 
genes  for  statin  -induced  toxicity  in  rat  primary  hepato-
cytes. 

Methods

Preparation  of  rat  primary  hepatocytes

from  Gibco 

Rat  primary  hepatocytes  were  isolated  using  a  modified 
method  described  in  elsewhere  (Klaunig, et al.)  and  by 
Percoll  centrifugation.  All  media  and  reagents  were  pur-
chased 
(NY,  USA)  unless  mentioned 
differently.  In  brief,  liver  was  perfused  via  portal  vein 
first  with  Ca2＋/Mg2＋  free  Hank’s  balanced  salt  solution 
(HBSS-)  containing  0.5  mM  EGTA  and  10  mM  HEPES 
for  2∼3  min  and  then  with  HBSS  with  Ca2＋/Mg2＋  con-
taining  10  mM  HEPES  and  0.5  mg/ml  collagenase 
(Wako)  for  6∼7  min  at  a  flow  rate  of  20  ml/min. 
Perfused  livers  were  isolated,  decapsulated  and  dis-
persed  in  ice-cold  HBSS-.  Dispersed  cells  were  filtered 
with  100μm  meshes,  rinsed  and  suspended  in  ice-cold 
50%  (v/v)  Percoll  (Amersham,  NJ,  USA)  and  centrifuged 
at  50  g  for  10  min  at  4oC.  Hepatocytes  were  rinsed  and 
suspended  in  Williams’  E  culture  media  supplemented 
with  10%  (v/v)  FCS,  2  mM  L-glutamate,  100  U/ml  pen-
icillin,  100μg/ml  streptomycin  and  10  mM  HEPES.  Cell 
cultures  showing  more  than  80%  viability,  based  on  try-
pan  blue  exclusion,  were  used  for  further  experiment.  All 
cultures  were  maintained  at  37oC  in  a  water-saturated 
5%  CO2  incubator  and  culture  media  were  changed  ev-
ery  day.

Cell  viability  assay  through  MTT  assay

Resazurin  assay  was  performed  to  estimate  cell  toxicity 
of  each  drug  using  rat  primary  hepatocytes.  Drugs  were 
first  dissolved  in  DMSO  (Sigma),  diluted  to  the  desired 
concentration  with  water  and  administrated  to  cells  for 
24  hours.  Then  20μL  of  CellTiter-Blue  (Promega)  were 
added  and  the  treated  cells  were  cultivated  in  CO2  in-
cubator  (NuAire,  US/NU-4350G)  for  4  hours.  The  level  of 
toxicity  was  observed  by  optical  density  using  micro-
plate  reader  (SpectraMax  plus/384,  Molecular  Devices, 
USA)  at  wavelength  of  570  nm. 

Drug  treatment  and  RNA  extraction

The  analytic  grade  statins  were  purchased  from  Sequoia 

Research  Product  (Pangbourne,  UK).  The  cells  were 
treated  with  the  drugs  at  designated  concentrations  (EC, 
1/25  of  LC20,  1/5  of  LC20  and  LC20)  for  24  hours  and 
lysed  with  lysis  buffer  (Invitrogen).  The  RNAs  were  ex-
tracted  using  easy-spinTM  Total  RNA  Extraction  Kit 
(Invitrogen).  Extracted  RNAs  were  quantified  with  spec-
trophotometer 
(NanoDrop  ND-1000,  Rockland,  DE, 
USA),  and  their  purity  was  estimated  by  ratio  of  optical 
density  at  230/260  nm  and  260/280  nm  of  wavelength. 

Analysis  of  gene  expression  using  DNA  micro-
array

Rat  Genome  230  2.0  GeneChips  (Affymetrix,  USA)  were 
used  to  profile  gene  expression  modulation  caused  by 
statins  in  this  experiment.  All  procedures  were  followed 
by  the  manufacturer’s  protocol  described  in  elsewhere 
(Ahn et al.,  2009).  In  short,  the  first  and  second  strand 
cDNAs  were  synthesized  using  One-Cycle  cDNA  Syn-
thesis  Kit  1  and  Sample  Cleanup  Module  1.  cRNAs  were 
transcribed  from  the  synthesized  cDNA  by  In  Vitro 
Transcription  (IVT)  Labeling  Kit  1,  and  fragmented  in  5X 
fragmentation  buffer  at  94oC  for  35  min.  The  fragmented 
cRNAs  were  hybridized 
the  gene  chips  using 
Hybridization  Control  Kit  1,  and  incubated  at  45oC  for 
16  hours.  Then  the  chips  were  washed  and  scanned  us-
ing  Affymetrix  GeneChip  Scanner.

in 

Micorarray  data  analysess

The  microarray  data  were  uploaded  to  Genplex  3.0  pro-
gram  (Istech,  Korea)  and  normalized  with  MAS5,  Global 
&  scale  method  recommended  by  Affymetrix.  Further 
statistical  analyses  were  mainly  performed  using  tools 
provided  by  Genplex  program. 

Results  and  Discussion

Cell  viability  assay  and  determination  of  LC20  for 
statins

We  treated  rat  primary  hepatocytes  with  variety  of  con-
centration  of  test  compounds,  cerivastatin,  simvastatin 
and  lovastatin  for  24  h  to  monitor  their  effects  on  cell 
viability  using  MTT  assay.  Cerivastatin,  simvastatin  and 
lovastatin  showed  significant  cell  death  and  revealed 
very  typical  viability  curves  with  dose-dependent  manner 
(Fig.  1).  The  LC20  for  each  drug  were  determined  as 
160μM,  120μM  and  200μM  respectively.  Cell  viability 
test  revealed  that  simvastatin  caused  more  cytotoxicity 
than  cerivastatin  and  lovastatin  in  rat  primary  hepato-
cytes.  This  observation  was  further  confirmed  by  other 
cell  viability  assay  using  HepG2  cells  (data  not  shown) 

Gene  Expression  Analysis  of  Statin  Cytotoxicity    43

where  simvastatin  also  showed  higher  cytotoxicity  than 
other  two  statins.  These in vitro  observations  could  not 
explain  or  reflect  exactly  what  happens  in  clinical  use  of 
statins  but  still  may  arouse  a  question  concerning  liver 
toxicity  induced  by  high  dose  of  statins  (Bolego, et al., 
2002).  Based  on  the  cell  viability  test  and  bibliographical 
searches,  the  concentrations  of  drugs  for  the  experiment 
were  set  at  1/25  fold  of  LC20,  1/5  fold  of  LC20  and  LC20. 
An  additional  concentration  (0.5  μM)  was  added  to  the 
experiment  to  monitor  the  expression  of  genes  which 
are  related  to  the  drug  efficacy. 

Analysis  of  gene  expression  from  rat  primary 
hepatocytes  treated  by  statins

Using  four  different  drug  concentrations  and  an  un-
treated  control,  the  effect  of  statins  on  gene  expression 
in  rat  primary  hepatocytes  was  assessed  by  microarray 
experiments.  Gene  expression  pattern  of  each  drug  was 
analyzed  by  One-way  ANOVA  (p  value  ＜0.05)  with  mul-
tiple  test  correction 
(Benjamini-Hochberg  FDR)  and 
showed  6,923,  2,688  and  4,383  genes  significantly 
modulated  at  least  one  dose  point  of  cerivastatin,  lova-
statin  and  simvastatin  treatment,  respectively.  To  exam-
ine  relations  between  drug  concentration  and  expression 
pattern,  hierarchical  clustering  analysis  (HCA)  was  per-
formed  for  each  drug  treatment  (Fig.  2).  The  HCA  re-
vealed  grouping  of  gene  expression  profiles  along  with

groups  into  the  same  cluster.  In  cerivastatin  treated  samples,  1/25  and  1/5  LC20  dose  groups  were  clustered  into  the  same
group  unlikely  simvastatin  and  lovastatin  treated  samples  which  showed  clustering  of  EC  and  1/25  LC20  dose  groups  into  the 
same  group.

the  drug  concentrations  and  resulted  in  four  distinctive 
hierarchical  clusters  in  samples  instead  of  five  clusters 
due  to  grouping  of  1/25  and  1/5  LC20  samples  in  the 
same  cluster.  Simvastatin  and  lovastatin  treatment  re-
sulted  in  grouping  EC  and  1/25  LC20  samples  into  the 
same  cluster  whereas  cerivastatin  treatment  resulted  in 
grouping  1/25  LC20  and  1/5  LC20  samples  into  the  same 
cluster.  This  observation  can  be  explained  by  the  differ-
ence  of  clinical  doses  of  the  drugs.  It  is  known  that  cer-
ivastatin  has  more  potent  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibition 
effect  than  other  statins  (Stein  et al.,  1997).  Based  on 
the  HCA  results,  it  seemed  that  cerivastatin  also  caused 
more  toxicity  than  other  two  statins  at  1/25  LC20  con-
centration.

Isolation  of  differentially  expressed  genes  by 
statin  treatment

Genes  whose  expressions  are  highly  modulated  (more 
than  two  fold)  by  statin  treatments  compared  with  con-
trol  were  isolated  from  each  drug  and  dose  conditions 
after  ANOVA  test  described  in  the  previous  section. 
Table  1  summarized  numbers  of  genes  showed  more 
two  expression  level  changes  in  treatment  group.  In 
brief,  cerivastatin  seemed  to  cause  the  most  serious  ef-

fect  on  gene  expression  in  every  dose  conditions. 
Numbers  of  significantly  modulated  genes  by  cerviasta-
tin  were  greater  up  to  five  fold  than  lovastatin  or  sim-
vastatin  depending  on  the  dose  conditions.  Since  cer-
ivastatin  showed  very  similar  expression  patterns  in  1/25 
and  1/5  LC20  doses  and  relatively  small  numbers  of 
DEG  (342  and  409  genes),  both  dose  groups  were  com-

lovastatin  and  simvastatin  revealed  similar  expression 
patterns  and  small  DEG  numbers  at  EC  and  1/25  LC20 
dose  groups  and  the  two  groups  were  combined  into  a 
single  group  (Low)  as  well  (Fig.  2  and  Table  1).

Isolation  of  Common  genes  modulated  by  three 
statins

As  mentioned  in  previous  section,  samples  were  group-
ed  as  low,  mid  and  high  depending  on  doses  and 
drugs.  Using  Venn  diagram  analysis,  commonly  modu-
lated  genes  by  the  drugs  at  each  dose  were  isolated.

respectively.  According 
(Kanehisa  and  Goto,  2000)  of  these  commonly  modu-
lated  genes,  all  three  drugs  modulated  genes  related  to 
statin  efficacy,  such  as  biosynthesis  of  steroids  and  fat-
ty  acid  metabolism,  at  low  and  mid  dose  groups  (Table 
2).  But  in  high  dose  treatment,  the  drugs  modulated 

low,  mid  and  high-dose

genes  related  to  cell  cycle  regulation  and  immune  re-
sponse  as  well  as  genes  in  fatty  acid  metabolism.  This 
observation  suggested  that  the  drugs  provoked  consid-
erable  cytotoxicity  in  rat  primary  hepatocytes  at  high 
dose  (Table  2).  Principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  of 
these  commonly  modulated  genes  (219  in  total)  classi-
fied  samples  into  three  well  defined  groups  such  as 
control,  a  group  mixed  with  low  and  mid  doses  and  a 
group  of  high  doses.  Based  on  these  results,  it  seemed 
obvious  that  statin  treatment  caused  toxic  effect  and 
distinctive  gene  modulation  only  at  high  dose  admin-
istration  (Fig.  3). 

Gene  Ontology  analysis  of  DEG  by  statin  treat-

To  further  investigate  which  biological  process  were  af-

was  performed  by  using  PANTHER  program  (Protein

(Fig.  4).  Gene  Ontology  analysis  also  showed  that  the 
most  enriched  GO  terms  by  statin  treatments  belonged 
to  cellular  metabolic  process  and  response  to  stress.  In

Isolation  of  indicator  genes  for  statin-induced 
cytotoxicity

Based  on  what  we  observed  from  DEG  analysis  and  GO 
analysis  of  DEG,  we  tried  to  isolate  genes  which  may 
serve  as  indicator  genes  for  statin-induced  cytotoxicity 
in  rat  primary  hepatocytes.  For  this  purpose,  genes 
which  were  significantly  modulated  by  all  three  statins 
and  belonged  to  response  to  stress  were  isolated  as 
putative  markers 
for  statin-induced  cytotoxicity.  29 
probes  fit  to  these  criteria  were  isolated  and  subjected 
to  hierarchical  clustering  (Fig.  5).  HCA  showed  a  very 
clear  clustering  of  genes  and  samples  into  two  groups. 
First  cluster  was  composed  of  low  dose  treatments  of 
each  drug  such  as  EC  and  1/25  LC20  dose  groups  ex-
cept  for  1/5  LC20  group  of  lovastatin  treatment.  Second 

cluster  was  mainly  composed  of  high  dose  samples 
such  as  1/5  LC20  and  LC20  groups  except  1/25  LC20  of 
cerivastatin.  The  last  cluster  was  composed  of  two  high 
dose  samples  of  cerivastatin  and  simvastatin.  Based  on 
the  expression  pattern  of  selected  genes,  cerivastatin 
seemed  to  have  greater  effect  on  expression  of  cytotox-
icity  related  genes  than  other  two  statins.  On  the  con-
trary,  lovastatin  seemed  to  have  the  least  effect  on  the 
expression  of  cytotxocity  related  genes.  Taken  together 
presented  results  and  previous  reports,  the  isolated  29 
probes  may  serve  as  indicator  genes  of  statin-induced 
cytotoxicity  in  rat  primary  hepatocytes.

PCR  verification  of  expression  level  of  the  puta-
tive  indicator  genes 

Since  understanding  the  gene  level  mechanism  of  sta-
tin-caused  hepatotoxicity  was  main  purpose  of  this 
study,  selected  29  probes  were  further  studied.  First,  bi-

induced  acute  phase  response 

ological  function  of  each  probe  was  watched  for  and 
corresponding  genes  were  isolated.  From  29  probes  iso-
lated  as  stress  markers,  we  were  able  to  identify  21 
genes  whose  functions  are  annotated  (Fig.  6).  It  was  re-
marked  that  many  genes  are  known  to  have  their  in-
volvements  in  inflammatory  or  coagulation  response 
such  as  Ccl2,  Ccl7,  Cxcl2,  F2r,  F3  and  Crp  among  an-
notated  genes  (Bharadwaj et al.,  1999;  Hsu et al.,  2006; 
Johnston et al.,  1999).  This  observation  concurred  with 
previously  reported  clinical  effects  of  statins  on  in-
flammation  or  coagulation  (Dols  et al.,  2009,  Maitland- 
van  der  Zee et al.,  2009).  This  implied  the  involvement 
of  these  biological  pathways  in  the  observed  cytotoxic 
effect  of  statins  on  rat  hepatocytes. 
    Genes  involved  in  cell  proliferation  were  also  found 
from  the  probe  set,  for  example  Cdc42ep5  predicted 
and  Tgfbeta2.  Beside  genes  involved  in  inflammation 
and  proliferation,  a  liver  specific  gene,  Hnf4alpha  was 
isolated.  Hnf4alpa  is  known  as  a  liver  specific  tran-
scription  factor  and  reported  to  have  interaction  with 
SMAD3/4  protein  in  TGFbeta  pathway  (Zannis  et al., 
2001).  Hnf4alpha  is  also  reported  to  have  implication  in 
ER  stress 
liver 
(Luebke-Wheeler  et al.,  2008). 
    Expression  of  annotated  21  genes  was  further  exam-
ined  by  RT-PCR  to  confirm  microarray  results  (Fig.  6). 
As  seen  in  Fig.  6,  some  of  them  (Creb3I3,  Lamc2,  Flat 
and  Oldlr1)  did  not  produce  any  detectable  PCR  prod-
ucts  but  still  most  of  them  showed  certain  concordance 
to  microarray  results.  In  particular,  genes  whose  func-
tions  are  closely  related  to  liver  toxicity  such  as  Crp, 
Hnf4alpha  and  TGFbeta2  showed  very  good  con-
cordance  between  microarray  and  RT-PCR  results. 
    In  the  presented  study,  we  employed  gene  expression 
profiling  techniques  and  bioinformatic  analyses  to  find  a 
set  of  genes  which  may  serve  as  indicators  for  statin-in-
duced  liver  toxicity.  Since  statins  are  mostly  widely  used 
drugs  in  the  world  to  treat  pandemic  hyperchorestero-
lemia  and  have  been  reported  recurrently  to  have  liver 
toxicity  in  clinical  uses,  finding  genes  which  could  ex-
plain  underlying  mechanism  and  serve  as  indicator  is  of 
most  interest  in  drug  development  and  regulation  field. 
By  combining  an in vitro  model  system  and  microarray 
techniques,  we  were  able  to  isolate  genes  whose  ex-
pressions  were  commonly  modulated  by  statins  and 
which  also  had  biological  functions  related  to  response 
to  stress.  It  is  still  too  early  to  say  that  the  genes  listed 
in  this  work  could  serve  as  biomarkers  for  statin-in-
duced  liver  toxicity  but  they  demonstrated  the  potential 
of  gene  expression  analysis  for  understanding  and  pre-
dicting  certain  effects  of  drugs  such  as  statin-induced 
cytotoxicity  in  rat  primary  hepatocytes.  To  further  vali-
date  current  findings  and  make  applicable  to  clinical 

purpose,  it  will  necessary  to  compare  biomarkers  from 
rat  primary  hepatocytes  with  those  from  human  primary 
hepatocytes  or  those  from  human  liver  tissues  (Hart  et 
al.,  2010).
