Abstract

biosynthetic 

peptidoglycan 

Monofunctional 
trans-
glycosylase  (MBPT)  catalyzes  the  formation  of  the  gly-
can  chain  in  bacterial  cell  walls  from  peptidoglycan  sub-
units:  N-acetylglucosamine  (NAG)  and  acetylmuramic 
acid  (NAM).  Bifunctional  glycosyltransferases  such  as 
the  penicillin  binding  protein  (PBP)  have  peptidoglycan 
glycosyltransferase  (PGT)  on  their  C  terminal  end  which 
links  together  the  peptidoglycan  subunits  while  trans-
peptidase  (TP)  on  the  N  terminal  end  cross-links  the 
peptide  moieties  on  the  NAM  monosaccharide  of  the 
peptide  subunits  to  create  the  bacterial  cell  wall.  The 
singular  function  of  MBPT  resembles  the  C  terminal  end 
of  PBP  as  it  too  contains  and  utilizes  a  similar  PGT 
domain.  In  this  article  we  analyzed  the  infectious  and 
non  infectious  protein  sequences  of  MBPT  from  31  dif-
ferent  strains  of  bacteria  using  a  variety  of  bioinformatic 
tools.  Motif  analysis,  dot-plot  comparison,  and  phyloge-
netic  analysis  identified  a  number  of  significant  differ-
ences  between  infectious  and  non-infectious  protein  se-
quences.  In  this  paper  we  have  made  an  attempt  to  ex-
plain,  analyze  and  discuss  these  differences  from  an 
evolutionary  perspective.  The  results  of  our  sequence 
analysis  may  open  the  door  for  utilizing  MBPT  as  a  new 
target  to  fight  a  variety  of  infectious  bacteria.

Introduction

Monofunctional  biosynthetic  peptidoglycan  transglycosy-
lase  is  a  member  of  Glycosyltransferase  Family  51  and 
present  in  over  3000  bacterial  species  as  well  as  three

eukaryotic  species:  moss,  green  algae,  and  ameboid 
(Sauvage et al.,  2008).  As  its  name  suggests,  the  protein 
is  involved  in  the  process  of  peptidoglycan  synthesis  by 
catalyzing  the  formation  of  glycan  chains  (Yuan  et al., 
2007).  The  Glycosyltransferase,  GT,  family  can  be  div-
ided  into  two  categories:  monofunctional  GT  and  bifunc-
tional  GT  which  has  a  glycosyltransferase  domain  as 
well  as  transpeptidase  domain  (Terrak et al.,  2008).  The 
bifunctional  GT  class  has  been  thoroughly  studied  as  a 
target  of  antibiotics  as  penicillin  is  known  to  bind  to  the 
transpeptidase  domain  of  the  bifunctional  GT  or  the 
penicillin-binding  protein  (Berardino,  1996;  Barrett,  2007). 
Monofunctional  biosynthetic  peptidoglycan  transglyco-
sylase  polymerizes  disaccharide  units  to  form  glycan 
chains,  which  are  cross-linked  by  transpeptidase  to 
build  the  peptidoglycan  walls  of  the  bacterial  cell  (Berar-
dino  et al.,  1996;  Terrak  et al.,  2008). 
    MBPT  catalyzes  the  formation  of  peptidoglycan  sub-
units  which  consist  of  two  monosaccharides:  N-acetyl-
glucosamine  (NAG  or  GlcNAc)  and  N-acetylmuramic 
acid  (NAM  or  MurNAc),  that  are  connected  by  a  β (1,4) 
glycosydic  bond  (Terrak et al.,  2008)  (Fig.  1).  The  NAM 
monosaccharide  has  two  different  peptide  moieties 
which  are  cross-linked  by  the  transpeptidase  enzyme  on 
the C terminal end of the PBP enzyme or by a monofunc-
tional  transpeptidase  protein  such  as  DD-transpeptidase, 
DD-carboxypeptidase,  and  DD-endopeptidase  (Ghuysen 
et al.,  1998;  Yuan et al.,  2007).  The  NAM  peptide  chain 
containing  D-alanine,  D-glutamic  acid,  and  meso-dia-
minopimelic  acid  is  present  in  the  thinner  cell  walled, 
gram  negative  bacteria  such  as  Hemophilus influenza. 
Gram  positive  bacteria  such  as  Staphylococcus aureus 
have  a  thicker  cell  wall  as  the  peptide  sequence  is: 
L-alanine,  D-glutamine,  L-lysine,  and  D-alanine.  MBPT 
links  the  nucleophilic  hydroxyl  group  on  the  fourth  car-
bon  of  the  NAG  moiety  to  the  electrophilic  carbon  with 
the  protruding  diphospholipid  chain  of  the  NAM  moiety 
(Yuan  et al.,  2007).  An  over  expression  of  the  MBPT 
gene,  mgt,  causes  an  increase  in  the  formation  of  the 
peptidoglycan  subunits,  in  vitro,  as  further  work  can  be 
done  to  analyze  the  precise  lengths  of  the  glycan  chain 
created  by  monofunctional  and  bifunctional 
trans-
peptidase  which  may  infer  further  differences  between 
infectious  and  non  infectious  bacteria  (Di  Berardino  et 
al.,  1996).  The  generation  of  MBPT  from  the mgt  gene 
also  gives  MBPT  its  own  identity  separate  from  the  bi-

Fig.  1.  Monofunctional  Biosynthetic  peptidoglycan  transglycosylase  (MBPT),  also  known 
as  Peptidoglycan  Glycosyltransferase,  acts  as  an  inducer  of  polymerization  to  produce 
the  long  carbohydrate  chains  of  the  bacterial  cell  wall.  MBPT  is  a  catalyst  which  joins 
the  diasaccharide  subunits  (NAG-NAM)  of  membrane  bound  Lipid  2  intermediates  to  cre-
ate  elongated  Lipid  peptidoglycan  subunits  such  as  Lipid  4,  6,  8,  to  form  the  carbohy-
drate  chain.  Protein  sequences  of  MBPT  and  PBP,  penicillin  binding  protein,  are  pre-
sented  above  the  mechanism  to  demonstrate  the  similarity  between  the  monofunctional
and  bifunctional  protein  sequences  and  their  usage  of  the  PGT  domain.

functional  PBP  which  is  transcribed  from  the pbp  gene 
even  though  both  enzymes  share  a  great  deal  of  homol-
ogy  in  their  respective  PGT  domains  (Barrett,  2007; 
DiBerardi  et al.,  1996;  Paik  et al.,  1997;  Spratt  et al., 
2006).  Bioinformatic  analysis  of  the  monofunctional 
transpeptidase  protein  may  provide  further  insight  into 
the  actions  of  infectious  bacteria  especially  in  compar-
ison  to  MBPT  and  PBP.  The  precise  role  of  each  pepti-
doglycan  synthesizing  enzyme  is  still  unknown  as  it  is 
possible  that  the  biosynthesis,  repair,  and  upkeep  of  the 
cell  wall  is  so  vital  that  each  enzyme  may  be  called 
upon  for  a  different  reason  be  it  synthesizing  a  new  cell 
wall,  repairing  the  cell  wall,  or  fixing  mistakes  in  the 
structure  of  the  cell  wall  all  of  which  are  similar  to  the 
role  of  polymerases  in  DNA  construction.  Though  the 
two  proteins  have  similar  roles,  structures,  and  domains 
(PGT),  MBPT  is  present  in  a  great  many  more  bacteria 
than  PBP  with  a  wide  variety  of  habitats  as  well  as 
forms  of  infection  suggesting  that  MBPT  may  play  a  key 
role  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  cell  wall  in  a  majority  of 
bacteria  and  a  new  source  of  differentiation  in  the  path-
ology  of  bacteria. 
    Bacterial  pathogenicity  has  been  one  of  the  highly 
studied  fields  for  obvious  reasons  and  has  lead  to  the 
identification  of  a  variety  of  virulence  factors  such  as 
adhesion  molecules,  metabolic  enzymes,  and  toxins, 
which  take  advantage  of  a  host’s  resources  to  allow  the 
infectious  bacteria  to  multiply  and  spread  (Yang  et al., 

2008).  The  degree  of  infection  and  its  aggressiveness 
can  be  defined  by  the  infectious  bacteria’s  virulence 
which  gages  the  potency  of  an  infectious  agent  based 
on  its  ability  to  invade  the  host’s  system  and  induce 
disease.  An  infectious  agent  has  to  be  able  to  penetrate 
the  host’s  immune  system  and  find  an  area  in  the  host 
to  multiply  which  is  predicated  on  the  infectious  bac-
teria’s  mode  of  conveyance  as  well  as  the  makeup  of 
the  cell’s  surface.  The  role  of  PBP  has  been  deeply 
studied  as  it  has  been  traditionally  targeted  by  a  variety 
of  antibiotics  giving  it  the  name,  penicillin  binding  pro-
tein  (Suginaka et al.,  2007).  A  number  of  sequenced  ge-
nomes  from  a  variety  of  bacterial  species  indicate  that 
a  majority  of  bacterial  species  have  acquired  genes  via 
horizontal  gene  transfer  which  allows  them  to  be  better 
suited  to  survive  in  certain  environmental  conditions  or 
niches  (Schmidt  and  Hensel,  2004).  Horizontal  gene 
transfer  can  be  achieved  through  a  variety  of  mecha-
nisms  including  natural  transformation  (Schmidt  and 
Hensel,  2004),  an  exchange  of  plasmids  and  pathoge-
nicity  islands  by  way  of  conjugation  (Schierack  et al., 
2006)  as  well  as  transduction  by  bacteriophages  (Wagner 
and  Waldor,  2002).  Evolutionary  differences  between  in-
fectious  and  non  infectious  bacteria  are  apparent  in  their 
protein  sequences  as  the  two  factions  continue  to  sepa-
rate  from  one  another  and  exploit  new  environments  for 
species  proliferation.  The  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  an-
alyze  MBPT  sequences  derived  from  infectious  and  non

infectious  microbial  organisms  using  a  variety  of  bio-
informatic  tools.  Here,  we  hypothesize  that  the  se-
quence  and  the  function  of  MBPT  differs  significantly 
between  the  two  groups.  The  differences  in  the  protein 
sequence  may  play  a  decisive  role  in  defining  the  path-
ogenicity  of  a  microbe. 

Methods

fifteen  sequences 

The  sequences  for  analysis  were  obtained  from  the 
NCBI  website  (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).  Thirty  one 
sequences  were  carefully  selected  based  on  their  size, 
function,  and  organism  origin.  The  selected  sequences 
include 
from  bacterial  species 
(fourteen  gamma  proteobacteria  and  one  alpha  proteo-
bacteria)  that  are  known  to  be  infectious  in  humans  and 
sixteen  sequences  from  non  infectious  bacterial  species 
(nine  alpha  proteobacteria  and  six  beta  proteobacteria). 
MBPT  was  chosen  because  of  its  occurrence  in  a  num-
ber  of  non  infectious  as  well  as  infectious  bacteria  from 
a  wide  variety  of  environments.  The  bacteria  were  se-
lected  based  on  the  severity  of  pathogenicity  as  the 
most  infectious  diseases  were  found  in  the  gamma  pro-

teobacteria  family  and  represented  in  the  infectious  bac-
teria  chosen  for  analysis. 
    Motifs  were  identified  using  the  MEME  Motif  Disco-
very  Tool  at  the  default  settings  except  for  increasing 
the  maximum  number  of  motifs  to  ten  (Bailey  et al., 
2006).  The  identification  of  similar  motifs  as  well  as  the 
analysis  of  the  phylogenic  tree  aided  in  the  construction 
of  the  dot  plots  to  further  analyze  the  position  of  specif-
ic  amino  acid  motifs  in  the  selected  protein  sequences. 
    Dot  matrices  were  constructed  using  the  dotmatcher 
program  in  which  the  chosen  sequences  were  com-
pared  to  show  similarity  among  the  infectious  bacteria 
and  the  non  infectious  bacteria  (Landes  et al.,  1998). 
Similarity  between  the  sequences  was  assessed  by 
showing  likeness  through  diagonal  fragments  in  which  a 
straight  diagonal  line  exemplifies  a  high  degree  of  sim-
ilarity  where  as  scattered  diagonal  fragments  illustrate 
points  of  difference  between  the  compared  protein 
sequences.  The  sequences  were  assessed  in  the  dot 
matcher  program  using  a  distance  matrix,  data  matrix, 
and  a  chi-squared  analysis  to  solely  project  the  diagonal 
fragments  of  similarity  between  the  axes  of  the  graph.

a  represents  alpha,  b  represents  beta,  and  g  represents  gamma  proteobacteria.  The  non  infectious  bacteria  have  an  asterisk
while  the  infectious  bacteria  do  not.  The  numbers  in  this  table  represent  each  of  the  31  bacteria  species  chosen  for  analysis
for  the  (b)  as  well.  (b)  The  sequences  of  motifs  5,  6,  8,  9,  and  10  are  presented  in  the  figure  above.  The  numbers  to  the

the  length  of  the  sequence  in  the  MBPT  enzyme  followed  by  the  sequence  itself.  For  example:  in  motif  5,  the  first  bacterium 
is  number  8, Escherichia coli O157:H7 str. Sakai,  has  a  length  of  204  amino  acids  which  are  shown  in  the  reading  sequence.

with  a  window  size  of  10  and  a  threshold  of  23  were 
performed  in  order  to  examine  the  similarities  between 
two  sequences  of  infectious  bacteria,  noninfectious  bac-
teria  as  well  as  between  infectious  and  non-infectious 
bacteria.  Further  analysis  was  done  to  exemplify  the  dif-
ferences  between  pathogenic  and  non  pathogenic  bac-
teria  and  to  isolate  and  evaluate  the  subtle  differences 
between  the  bacteria  sequences. 
    Our  sequences  were  aligned  using  Clustal  X  (Thomp-
son  et al.,  1997).  The  phylogenic  tree  was  constructed 
using  the  neighbor-joining  method  from  the  sequence 
alignment  using  PHYLIP  (Felsenstein,  1989).  The  “Boot-
strapping”  method  was  performed  on  the  phylogenic 
tree  to  assure  the  position  of  the  clades  as  well  as  pre-
senting  evolutionary  relationships  between  the  infectious 
and  non  infectious  bacteria.  The  tree  was  then  viewed 
in  TREEVIEW  for  further  evaluation  of  the  selected  se-
quences  (Page  et al.,  1996).

Results

When  analyzing  the  MBPT  motifs  of  infectious  and  non 
infectious  bacteria  it  becomes  apparent  that  there  are 
several  distinct  differences  between  MBPT  in  infectious 
versus  non  infectious  bacteria.  The  infectious  bacteria 
share  motifs  5  and  6  while  the  non  infectious  bacteria 
share  domain  9  (Fig.  2).  Motif  5  is  present  in  sequences 
1  (Shewanella sp. W3-18-1)  through  10  (Yersinia pseu-
dotuberculosis PB1/＋)  as  well  as  sequence  12  (Haemo-
philus influenza PittGG)  through  14  (Pseudomonas aeru-
ginosa PA7)  which  are  all  members  of  the  gamma  pro-
teobacteria  family.  Motif  5  is  not  present  in  the  se-
quences  of  11  (Haemophilus influenza PittEE)  from  the 

gamma  proteobacteria  family  and  15  (Phenylobacterium 
zucineum HLK1)  from  the  alpha  proteobacteria  family 
and  is  also  missing  from  the  non  infectious  bacteria 
group  marked  with  an  (*).  Motif  9  is  present  in  se-
quences  11  and  15  as  well  as  all  of  the  non  infectious 
bacteria  *16  (Oligotropha  carboxidovorans  OM5)  through 
*31  (Ralstonia metallidurans CH34)  with  the  exception 
of  *25  (Azoarcus sp. BH72).  Motif  6  is  in  all  of  the  in-
fectious  bacteria  except  for  1  (Shewanella sp. W3-18-1) 
and  15  (Phenylobacterium zucineum HLK1)  as  well  as 
being  absent  in  all  of  the  non  infectious  bacteria.  Motif 
8  exists  only  in  the  bacteria  from  two  different  genuses: 
Shigella  and  Escherichia  as  these  two  bacteria  are 
closely  related. 
    The  dot  plots  show  the  degree  of  similarity  between 
specified  protein  sequences  of  infectious  and  non  in-
fectious  bacteria  (Fig.  3).  The  dot  plots  comparing  non 
infectious  to  infectious  strains  of  bacteria  enable  specific 
points  of  the  protein  structure  to  be  identified  and 
analyzed.  The  data  produced  by  the  dot  plots  reinforces 
the  minute  differences  found  between  specified  protein 
sequences  and  can  be  used  for  further  analysis  of  dif-
ferent  amino  acid  residues  among  two  different  species 
of  bacteria.  The  dot  plots  comparing  non  infectious  to 
infectious  bacteria  underline  the  motifs  that  are  con-
served  between  the  two  types  of  bacteria  such  as motifs 
1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 while reinforcing the motifs within specific 
domains  that  are  not  shared:  6,  5,  9,  and  8.
    As  hypothesized,  the  phylogenic  tree  analysis  identi-
fied  two  distinct  clades:  one  aligning  the  infectious  bac-
teria  and  the  other  aligning  the  non  infectious  bacteria 
(Fig.  4).  The  non-  infectious  bacteria  are  divided  be-
tween  alpha  and  beta  classes  of  proteobacteria  as  al-

Fig.  3.  The  dot  plot  comparisons 
show  the  amount  of  dissimilarity 
between  infectious  and  non  in-
fectious  bacteria  when  an  MBPT 
protein  sequence  from  infectious 
and  non  infectious  bacteria  are 
compared  to  one  another.  Infec-
tious  and  non  infectious  dot  plot

within  the  two  groups  of  bacteria.

most  all  of  the  infectious  bacteria  are  in  the  gamma 
proteobacteria  family  except  for Phenylobacterium zuci-
neum HLK1,  an  alpha  proteobacteria.  The  lower  scores 
of  some  of  the  infectious  bacteria  like Shigella dysenter-
iae Sd197, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7,  and Phenylo-
bacterium zucineum HLK1  show  some  evolutional  and 
sequential  distance  between  these  species  of  bacteria 
and  the  other  species  of  infectious  bacteria  yet  are  able 
to  remain  within  the  infectious  grouping.  The  bacteria 
Rhodopseudomonas palustris CGA009  exhibits  some 
phylogenetic  distance  by  its  lower  score  while  remaining 

in  the  non  infectious  group  of  bacteria.  The  evolutionary 
distance  of  bacteria  in  the  phylogenic  the  tree  shows 
adaptation  of  these  bacteria  to  new  niches  that  others 
are  not  able  to  propagate  in  and  these  differences  be-
come  apparent  in  the  sequence  of  MBPT  for  the  partic-
ular  bacteria.

Discussion

The  phylogenic  analysis  of  MBPT  shows  a  definite  sep-
aration  in  the  protein  sequence  between  a  variety  of  in-

68    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(2)  63-69,  June  2010

in  mimicry  of  a  non 

fectious  and  non  infectious  bacteria.  The  formation  of 
the  phylogenic  tree  shows  the  possibility  that  infectious 
bacteria  may  have  evolved  from  non  infectious  bacteria 
due  to  the  separation  of  the  two  types  of  bacteria 
(Maurelli,  2006).  An  analysis  of  the  bacterial  motifs 
shows  particular  differences  among  the  infectious  and 
non  infectious  bacteria  including  the  presence  of  motifs 
5,  6,  and  8  in  the  infectious  bacteria.  Absence  and 
movement  of  motifs  9  and  10  are  noted  among  the  in-
fectious  and  non  infectious  bacteria  and  may  also  glean 
more  insight  into  the  pathogenicity  of  bacteria.  Motifs  1, 
2,  and  3  are  recognized  as  being  structurally  required 
by  all  of  the  bacteria.  The  movement  of  motif  10  is  evi-
dent  in  our  motif  analysis  and  further  investigation  may 
give  us  a  clue  as  to  why  it  is  prominently  in  one  posi-
tion  in  the  infectious  bacteria  and  another  in  the  non  in-
fectious  bacteria.  The Phenylobacterium zucineum HLK1 
bacteria  not  only  lacks  the  traditional  motifs  for  infection 
but  also  has  motif  10  arranged  on  the  outside  of  the 
protein  sequence 
infectious 
bacteria.  The  fact  that  an  infectious  bacteria  can  imitate 
a  non  infectious  bacteria  is  concerning  but  the  only 
clear  anomaly  in  this  study.  The  changes  between  spe-
cific  amino  acids  in  the  MBPT  sequences  reinforces 
evolutionary  changes  between  infectious  and  non  in-
fectious  bacteria  which  enable  the  infectious  bacteria  to 
take  advantage  of  new  roles  for  further  propagation  of 
their  species  that  the  non  infectious  bacteria  are  unable 
to  assume.  Comparison  of  motif  organization,  amino 
acid  sequences,  dot  plots  and  the  phylogenic  tree  can 
isolate  particular  points  of  divergence  between  the  in-
fectious  and  non  infectious  bacterial  sequences  that 
may  be  exploited  as  a  new  source  to  fight  infection. 
Further  sequential,  biochemical,  and  evolutionary  analy-
sis  may  continue  to  show  details  found  in  the  analysis 
presented  here  for  a  novel,  applicable  treatment  to  a 
wide  variety  of  infectious  bacteria. 
    The  bioinformatic  analysis  of  Monofunctional  Biosyn-
thetic  Peptidoglycan  Transglycosylase  presented  here 
shows  a  clear  distinction  in  the  protein  sequence  be-
tween  the  infectious  and  non  infectious  bacteria.  Further 
analysis  can  be  done  to  create  a  viable  application  to 
fight  a  multitude  of  bacterial  infection  using  MBPT.  An 
analysis  of  the  role  of  MBPT  in  cell  division  may  further 
shed  some  light  on  its  cellular  role  as  well  as  its  ability 
to  evade  antibiotics,  like  β-lactam,  which  inhibit  the  bi-
functional  transpeptidase  activity  of  PBP  (Di  Berardino 
et al.,  1996).  A  comparison  of  the  monofunctional  and 
bifunctional  protein  sequences  may  produce  further  in-
sight  in  the  pathogenicity  of  these  cell  wall  building 
proteins.  The  analysis  presented  here  provides  a  basis 
on  which  further  research  for  utilizing  MBPT  as  a  new 
target  for  inhibiting  bacterial  infection  can  be  built  upon.
