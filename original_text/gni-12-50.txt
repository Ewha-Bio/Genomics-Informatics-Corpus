We  present  a  new  next-generation  sequencing-based  method  to  identify  somatic  mutations  of  lung  cancer.  It  is  a 
comprehensive  mutation  profiling  protocol  to  detect  somatic  mutations  in  30  genes  found  frequently  in  lung  adeno-
carcinoma. The total length of the target regions is 107 kb, and a capture assay was designed to cover 99% of it. This method 
exhibited about 97% mean coverage at 30× sequencing depth and 42% average specificity when sequencing of more than 
3.25 Gb was carried out for the normal sample. We discovered 513 variations from targeted exome sequencing of lung 
cancer cells, which is 3.9-fold higher than in the normal sample. The variations in cancer cells included previously reported 
somatic mutations in the COSMIC database, such as variations in TP53, KRAS, and STK11 of sample H-23 and in EGFR of 
sample H-1650, especially with more than 1,000× coverage. Among the somatic mutations, up to 91% of single nucleotide 
polymorphisms  from  the  two  cancer  samples  were  validated  by  DNA  microarray-based  genotyping.  Our  results 
demonstrated the feasibility of high-throughput mutation profiling with lung adenocarcinoma samples, and the profiling 
method can be used as a robust and effective protocol for somatic variant screening.

Introduction

Non-small-cell lung cancer is an increasingly common and 
lethal  disease,  accounting  for  25%  of  all  cancer  deaths. 
Sequencing  of  the  lung  cancer  genome  is  of  particular 
interest for identifying driver mutations and their pathways 
involved  in  cancer  growth  and  development  [1].  Somatic 
mutational  profiles  are  crucial  for  cancer  diagnosis  and 
classification, which lead to tailoring the best therapeutic 
strategy to individual patients [2]. 

Previous  studies  using  the  Sanger  sequencing  method 
have identified several key mutations associated with lung 
cancer. Massive PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of 
623 candidate cancer genes in 188 lung adenocarcinomas 
discovered  26  mutational  target  genes  [3].  Although  the 
study  provided  highly  valuable  results,  it  is  very  time- 
consuming and costly－so much so that a single laboratory 

can  hardly  perform  this  kind  of  large-scale  sequencing 
projects. 

A mass spectrometric-based mutation detection techno-
logy,  named  OncoMap,  has  been  effective  in  identifying 
somatic mutations in cancer genomes [4]. Currently, it can 
detect more than 1,000 mutations in 112 commonly mu-
tated genes that were previously identified as oncogenes and 
tumor  suppressors  [5].  Although  OncoMap  is  a  high- 
throughput method for mutational profiling with both fresh 
frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue samples, the mutation 
detection is limited to previously identified mutations, and it 
cannot discover novel mutations. 

Recent  advancements  of  next-generation  sequencing 
technology  have  made  breakthroughs  in  identifying  un-
known somatic mutations [6]. Combined with sequencing 
technology,  targeted  enrichment  techniques  have  been 
developed to reduce sequencing cost and time [7]. Several 
recent studies have reported targeted resequencing of cancer

samples using next-generation sequencing technologies [8, 
9]. 

Here,  we  present  a  fast  and  cost-effective  method  to 
identify somatic mutations in lung cancer. We surveyed the 
literature and chose 30 mutational target genes that were 
associated strongly with lung adenocarcinoma development. 
Target gene capture was performed using selector probes, 
which involved circularization and amplification of specific 
restriction fragments covering the target genes using rolling 
circle amplification [10]. The captured target DNAs were 
analyzed  by  next-generation  sequencing  to  find  somatic 
variations. This method could be useful to detect previously 
known recurrent mutations as well as novel variations.

Methods
Preparation of genomic DNA from cancer cell lines 

We ordered normal genomic DNA sample from the Coriell 
Institute Cell Repository (CCR ID NA17022; Camden, NJ, 
USA), which originated from a normal Caucasian male of 
European descent. For cancer genomic DNAs, H-1650 and 
H-23  cancer  cells  were  cultured  and  harvested  for  DNA 
preparation. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted with the 
QIAamp  DNA  blood  kit  according  to  the  manufacturer's 
instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The DNA quality 
and  quantity  were  assessed  with  the  use  of  a  Nanodrop 
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, 
DE, USA).

Design and oligonucleotides

The list of the entire exons for the 30 genes was obtained 
from a consensus coding sequence database, CCDS (build 
36.3), showing a total number of 701 exons covering 102 kb, 
according to hg18 (March, 2006 assembly). 

Targeted  restriction  fragments  were  selected  using 
Disperse software [11]. Templates for circularization of each 
chosen targeted fragment (selector probes) were designed 
using  ProbeMaker  software  [12].  Each  selector  probe 
consisted of two sequences of 20－25 nucleotides comple-
mentary to the ends of its targeted restriction fragment. 

The 3'-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA 
Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA) were prepared by incu-
bating the oligonucleotides with 1× Tdt buffer (NEB), 1× 
CoCl2  (NEB),  0.1  mM  dUTP-biotin  (Roche  Diagnostics, 
Mannheim,  Germany),  and  0.2  units/μL  terminal  trans-
ferase (NEB) in a final volume of 50 μL. The reaction was 
incubated  at  37°C  for  1  h  and  followed  by  enzyme 
inactivation at 75°C for 20 min.

genomic  DNAs  from  each  sample,  including  SfcI  and 
Hpy188I in NEB buffer 4; DdeI and AluI in NEB buffer 2; MseI 
and Bsu36I in NEB buffer 3; MslI and BfaI in NEB buffer 4; 
HpyCH4III and Bsp1286 in NEB buffer 4; SfcI and NlaIII in 
NEB  buffer  4;  MseI  and  HpyCH4III  in  NEB  buffer  4;  and 
HpyCH4V  and  EcoO109I  in  NEB  buffer  4  (New  England 
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The restriction reactions con-
tained  1  unit  each  of  two  restriction  enzymes  and  their 
corresponding compatible NEB buffer in 1× concentration 
and 0.85  μg/μL bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a total 
volume of 10 μL. The reactions were incubated at 37°C for 
60 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 80°C for 20 min. 
A total of 80 μL of pooled digested sample was mixed 
with 10 pM biotinylated selector probes, 1 M NaCl, 10 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 in a 
total volume of 160  μL. The mixture was incubated and 
hybridized at 95°C for 10 min, 75°C for 30 min, 68°C for 30 
min, 55°C for 30 min, and 46°C for 10 h. The hybridized 
solution was mixed with 10 μL M-280 streptavidin-coated 
magnetic beads (3.35 × 107 beads/mL; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, 
CA, USA) in 1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM 
EDTA, and 0.1% Tween-20 in a final volume of 200 μL and 
incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After incubation, 
the beads were collected using a ring magnet and washed in 
1 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1% 
Tween-20 in a total volume of 200 μL at 46°C for 30 min 
with rotation.

Multiple displacement amplification 

Genomic fragments were circularized by incubating the 
beads  with  1×  Ampligase  reaction  buffer,  0.25  U/μL 
Ampligase (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA), and 0.1 μg/μL 
BSA in a total volume of 50 μL at 55°C for 10 min. The 
circularized  molecules  were  separated  from  the  beads  by 
incubation with 5 μL sample buffer at 95°C for 10 min and 
collected  with  a  ring  magnet  rack.  The  supernatant  was 
incubated with 5 μL reaction buffer and 0.2 μL enzyme mix 
(Templiphi; GE Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) at 30°C 
for 4 h, followed by inactivation at 65°C for 10 min.

Real-time quantitative PCR analysis

The  enriched  samples  were  analyzed  with  real-time 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) and DNA quantification to eva-
luate  enrichment  bias  and  specificity.  PCR  primers  were 
placed  randomly  in  the  targeted  regions  and  quality 
controlled using standard genomic DNA. The qPCR results 
were used to estimate how much target DNA was present in 
the  amplification  products,  and  then,  the  specificity 
(proportion target material) was estimated by measuring the 
amount of DNA in the reactions.

Eight different restriction reactions were used to digest 

The enriched and pre-enriched control DNAs were diluted

(final dilution 1:3,600) in a PCR mix containing 1× PCR 
buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 unit Platinum Taq, 0.2 mM dNTP 
(10297-018; Invitrogen), 1× SYBR Green I, 10% DMSO, and 
0.16 μM of either on-target primer or off-target primer to a 
total volume of 30 μL. The genomic reference DNA was 10 
ng of template in the same PCR mixture as described above. 
The qPCR was performed using an LC480 Real-Time PCR 
system (Roche), and the conditions were as follows: 95°C for 
5 min followed by 40 cycles of (95°C 15 s, 56°C 30 s), with 
end-point  measurement  of  the  fluorescence  after  each 
completed cycle.

Library preparation and massive parallel sequencing 

Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer's 
instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 5 μg of 
gDNA in 200 μL nuclease-free water was fragmented by a 
Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liege, Belgium) at high power for 30 
min  (30  s  ON  and  30  s  OFF).  Overhangs  of  fragmented 
gDNA were converted to blunt ends using T4 DNA ligase 
and Klenow enzyme. Subsequently, an ‘A’ base was added to 
the ends of double-stranded DNA using Klenow exo- (3' to 5' 
exo minus). The paired-end adaptor (Illumina) with a single 
‘T’ base overhang at the 3' end was ligated to the products 
above. The PE adaptor-ligated products were separated on a 
2% agarose gel and excised from the gel from approximately 
400 bp to 500 bp. The sequencing libraries were bar-coded to 
allow sequencing of 6 samples in one lane of a flow cell. 
Size-selected DNA fragments were enriched by PCR with PE 
primers  1.1  and  2.1  (Illumina).  The  concentration  of  the 
libraries was measured on both a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and Qubit IT (Invitrogen). Finally, the libraries 
were validated by a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). The gDNA library was sequenced using the 
Illumina  genome  analyzer  GAIIx  according  to  the  manu-
facturer’s instructions.

Short read alignment and variation calling 

A total of 76-bp paired-end or single-end sequence reads 
with  ~200-bp  insert  size  were  aligned  to  the  human 
reference genome (NCBI build 37, hg19) with BWA algo-
rithm1 ver. 0.5.8c and default parameters [13]. Two mis-
matches were permitted in a 45-bp seed sequence. Putative 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small INDELs 
were called by the pileup vcf function of Samtools (ver.0.1.9) 
[14].  The  options  used  in  filtering  variations  were  a 
minimum of 6 for mapping depth and quality threshold of 50 
for  single  nucleotide  variations  (SNVs)  and  20  for  small 
INDELs. Predicted SNVs were compared with NCBI dbSNP 
version 131 (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/) 
to remove known SNP information. Non-synonymous SNV 
information  was  extracted  by  comparing  UCSC  (http:// 

genome.ucsc.edu/)  reference  gene  information  with  the 
somatic mutation list in the COSMIC cancer information 
database (http://www. sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). 
PolyPhen (polymorphism phenotyping) was utilized to pre-
dict  possible  changes  in  protein  structure  and  function 
resulting from a non- synonymous amino acid change.

Genome-wide SNP analysis 

SNP genotyping was performed using the Axiom geno-
typing solution, including an Axiom Genome-Wide ASI 1 
Array Plate and reagent kit, according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, total 
genomic DNA (200 ng) was treated with 20 μL of dena-
turation buffer and 40 μL neutralization buffer, followed by 
amplification for 23 h using 320 μL of Axiom amplification 
mix. Amplified DNA was randomly fragmented into 25 to 
125 base pair (bp) sizes with 57 μL of Axiom fragmentation 
mix at 37°C for 30 min, followed by DNA precipitation for 
DNA clean-up and recovery. DNA pellets were dried and 
resuspended with 80 μL of hybridization master mix; 3 μL 
of suspended sample was kept for sample qualification. A 
hybridization-ready  sample  was  denatured  using  a  PCR 
machine at 95ºC for 20 min and 48ºC for 3 min. Denatured 
DNA was transferred to a hybridization tray and loaded onto 
a GeneTitan MC with an Axiom ASI array plate (Affymetrix). 
Hybridization continued on the GeneTitan for 24 h, followed 
by  loading  of  ligation,  staining,  and  stabilization  reagent 
trays into the instrument. After chip scanning, the cel in-
tensity file was normalized, and genotype calling was done 
using Genotyping Console 4.1 with Axiom GT1 algorithms 
according to the manufacturer’s manual. The cut-off values 
for  data  quality  control  were  DISHQC  ≥ 0.82  for  hybri-
dization and QC call rate ≥ 97%.

Results
Capture design

The 30 genes known to be mutated in lung cancer were 
chosen for targeted resequencing (Table 1). The 701 coding 
regions  in  30  genes  covered  102  kb  according  to  the 
consensus  coding  sequence  (CCDS)  database.  Capture 
sequences to achieve redundant coverage over the coding 
regions were chosen based on length (100－1,000 bp) and 
GC  content  (20－65%)  and  to  avoid  repetitive  genomic 
elements  in  the  ends.  After  analysis  of  in  silico-digested 
restriction  fragments  of  the  target  regions,  the  best 
combinations  of  restriction  enzymes  were  selected  to 
provide over 99% coverage of targeted bases.

cinoma cell lines (H-1650 and H-23) were examined in this 
study. It is reported in the COSMIC database that the H-1650 
cell line has a deletion mutation in the EGFR gene, while the 
H-23 cell line has mutations in the KRAS, STK11, and TP53 
genes. 

After target gene enrichment, the enriched DNAs were 
analyzed using qPCR with primers targeting the regions of 
interest, along with qPCR primers targeting irrelevant, non- 
amplified  loci  outside  the  target  regions.  The  correlation 
between the replicates was high (average r2 = 0.97), and the 
majority of primer pairs clustered within a range of 3 Cts 
(threshold cycle in qPCR). Therefore, the enrichment was 
highly reproducible, and the enrichment bias was minimal. 
The enriched DNAs showed an average Ct of 17 with the 
target primers, while primer pairs targeting loci outside of 
the target regions had average Cts of 33. This indicated that 
the enrichment was target-specific. The average specificity in 
the normal samples was 28% when calculated from the Ct

was more than 95% at 30×, but two genes, CDKN2A and 
LTK,  showed  low  coverage  of  75%  and  84%,  respectively 
(Table 1). 

Using the final mapped reads, we constructed a genomic 
profile database for detecting SNVs (Supplementary Table 1) 
and short insertions and deletions (INDELs) (Supplemen-
tary Table 2). In each sample, we identified 81－179 SNVs 
and 50－90 small INDELs in target gene regions (Table 4). 
Cancer samples (H-1650 and H-23) showed about twice as 
many SNVs than the normal sample (NA17022).

By  subtracting  SNVs  found  in  the  SNP  databases,  we 
identified cancer-specific somatic mutation candidates, and 
identical somatic mutations of the cancer cell lines in the 
COSMIC  database  were  found.  All  previously  known  so-
matic mutations in the TP53, KRAS, and STK11 genes of 
sample H-23 and in the EGFR gene of sample H-1650 were 
identified in this study (Table 4).

The  validity  of  the  data  was  also  examined  with  a 
genome-wide  SNP  microarray,  which  has  37 SNPs  in  the 
target  region  (Axiom  Array;  Affymetrix).  The  genotyping 
data showed 80－91% concordance without any bias (Table 
5).  The  disconcordant  variations  were  not  biased  to  any 
sample, coverage, or genotype.

Discussion

Our targeted resequencing method for somatic mutation 
profiling in lung cancer from 30 cancer-related genes pro-
duced  unbiased  target  DNAs  repeatedly.  Analysis  of  the 
enriched  DNAs  by  next-generation  sequencing  identified 
previously known mutations in the samples. Further ana-
lysis of more samples by targeted resequencing will reveal 
many novel variant candidates.

Target  enrichment  was  performed  using  Selector  tech-
nology (Halo Genomics, Uppsala, Sweden), which showed 
improved coverage and compatibility with next-generation 
sequencing library construction by employing rolling-circle 
amplification [10]. This method exhibited about 97% mean 
coverage at 30× depth, average 42% specificity, and high 
reproducibility  (r2  =  0.98)  of  target  enrichment  in  the 

Fig.  1.  Target  coverage  in  cancer  and  normal  samples.  The 
cumulative  coverage  of  targeted  bases  (i.e.,  the  fraction  of  all 
sequenced  bases  in  the  target  regions  that  share  more  than  a 
particular  read  depth)  were  plotted  after  sequencing  4.34  Gb  of 
H-1650 (black), 6.03 Gb of H-23 (blue), and 3.25 Gb of NA17022
(red).  The  sequencing  yield  in  the  three  samples  resulted  in  30×
coverage  of  92%  (H-1650),  95%  (H-23),  and  97%  (NA17022)  of
all  target  regions.

coverage, specificity, and reproducibility across the targeted 
loci. 

On average, 4.3 gigabases (Gb) was produced per sample, 
and they were mapped to the reference genome (NCBI build 
37, hg19) at a 73－90% mapping rate (Table 3). 

The 26－41% of the uniquely mapped reads were found in 
the region of interest, demonstrating moderate specificity of 
this  approach.  The  normal  sample  showed  the  lowest 
mapping rate (73.03%) but the highest specificity (41.58%), 
indicating that cancer genomes are less efficient for exome 
sequencing due to genomic changes.

In addition, about 97% of the targeted bases were covered 
at more than 30× (Fig. 1). This high depth coverage could 
allow us to examine low-purity cancer samples, which are 
not normally analyzed by Sanger sequencing or genotyping 
tools. The actual coverage of the normal sample differed, 
depending on the gene. The coverage of most target genes

normal sample (Tables 1－3), indicating that this is appli-
cable to targeted resequencing of clinical samples. Although 
the enrichment specificity was moderate, this was overcome 
by increasing sequencing depth. As the total DNA bases of 
the target regions was 107 kb, 97% coverage at 30× depth 
was  achieved  by  3.25  Gb  of  sequencing,  which  does  not 
create any cost issues by using next-generation sequencing 
technologies.

Exome resequencing has proven to be robust and effective 
for  somatic  variant  detection  in  coding  regions  [31,  32]. 
Comparisons of sequencing data from normal and cancer 
tissues  from  individual  patients  have  unveiled  individual 
somatic  mutation  profiles.  However,  the  cancer  cell  lines 
that we used had no normal cell pairs. To solve this problem, 
we tried to remove previously known normal variations as 
much as possible. Predicted SNVs from the sequencing data 
were further filtered using common variation information 
from  the  most  updated  dbSNP  database.  As  a  result,  we 
found many somatic mutations, which included previously 
reported  mutations  in  the  COSMIC  database,  such  as 
variations in TP53, KRAS, and STK11 of sample H-23 and in 
EGFR of sample H-1650 (Table 4). Especially, the number of 
reads that covered the four variations was more than 1,000. 
This provides many advantages when compared to whole- 
genome sequencing or whole-exome sequencing. Sequen-
cing  of  cancer  samples  has  raised  several  issues,  such  as 
sample purity and cancer heterogeneity. These shortcomings 

can  only  be  overcome  by  in-depth  sequencing  of  target 
regions.  Therefore,  our  protocol  is  also  useful  for  cost- 
effective  somatic  mutation  screening  of  admixed  clinical 
cancer samples.

Compared  to  whole-genome  sequencing,  targeted  se-
quencing  has  an  issue  with  uneven  coverage  of  targeted 
genes. In Table 3, cancer samples showed fewer sequencing 
reads at target regions. This low target capture efficiency in 
cancer samples could be explained by genetic variations in 
cancer  genomes  that  inhibit  the  hybridization  between 
cancer  DNA  fragments  and  the  designed  capture  oligo-
nucleotides. This may be overcome by trial-and-error scree-
ning in selecting more efficient oligonucleotides. 

There are two kinds of target capture technologies: hybri-
dization and PCR. Hybridization-based target capture has 
been widely used and is able to cover more target regions but 
is time-consuming and hard to handle with many samples. In 
contrast, the PCR-based method is faster and allows us to 
handle more samples. Our protocol is a multiple displace-
ment amplification-based method that is as efficient as the 
PCR-based method. For example, hybridization-based target 
capture  methods,  such  as  the  Agilent  SureSelect  target 
enrichment  kit  and  NimbleGen  SeqCap  EZ  kit,  normally 
handle 1－8 samples at the same time, while our protocol 
with a liquid handler could process 96 samples in parallel. 
This costs 12 times less money. Therefore, our target enrich-
ment is scalable and easy to handle with multiple samples.

This can result in remarkable reduction of total cost when 
combined  with  multiplexed  next-generation  sequencing. 
Therefore, our target resequencing protocol provides a scal-
able sample-handling tool for a genetic variation study of 
lung adenocarcinoma.
