Abstract

to 

their  offspring 

Little  evidence  supports  the  existence  of  imprinted 
genes  in  chicken.  Imprinted  genes  are  thought  to  be  in-
timately  connected  with  the  acquisition  of  parental  re-
sources  in  mammals;  thus,  the  predicted  lack  of  this 
type  of  gene  in  chicken  is  not  surprising,  given  that  they 
leave 
their  own  heritance  after 
conception.  In  this  study,  we  identified  several  imprinted 
genes  and  their  orthologs  in  human,  mouse,  and  zebra-
fish,  including  30  previously  identified  human  and  mouse 
imprinted  genes.  Next,  using  the  HomoloGene  database, 
we  identified  six  orthologous  genes  in  human,  mouse, 
and  chicken;  however,  no  orthologs  were  identified  for 
SLC22A18,  and  mouse Ppp1r9a  was  not  included  in  the 
HomoloGene  database.  Thus,  from  our  analysis,  four 
imprinted  genes  (IGF2,  UBE3A, 
candidate  chicken 
PHLDA2, and GRB10)  were  identified.  To  expand  our 
analysis,  zebrafish  was  included,  but  no  probe  ID  for 
UBE3A  exists  in  this  species.  Thus,  ultimately,  three 
candidate  imprinted  genes (IGF2, PHLDA2, and GRB10) 
in  chicken  were  identified. GRB10  was  not  significant  in 
chicken  and  zebrafish  based  on  the  Wilcoxon-Mann- 
Whitney  test,  whereas  a  weak  correlation  between 
PHLDA2  in  chicken  and  human  was  identified  from  the 
Spearman's  rank  correlation  coefficient.  Significant  asso-
ciations  between  human,  mouse,  chicken,  and  zebrafish 
were  found  for  IGF2  and  GRB10  using  the  Friedman's 
test.  Based  on  our  results, IGF2, PHLDA2,  and GRB10 
are  candidate  imprinted  genes  in  chicken.  Importantly, 
the  strongest  candidate  was  PHLDA2.

Introduction

Imprinted  genes  are  not  inherited  in  a  recessive  or  dom-
inant  fashion  (http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press/2002/ 
November/epigenetics.htm);  instead,  they  are  mono-
allelic,  meaning  that  they  are  epigenetically  expressed 
from  a  single  parent-specific  allele  (either  paternal 
[sperm]  or  maternal  [egg]).  Such  genes  are  also  asyn-
chronously  replicated  from  pre-imprinted  chromosomes 
(Reik  and  Walter.,  2001).  Imprinting  is  believed  to  be  im-
portant  in  placental  mammals,  because  it  may  affect  the 
transfer  of  resources  between  mother  and  offspring; 
however,  imprinted  genes  also  exist  in  higher  seed 
plants,  which  utilize  a  placenta-like  tissue  known  as  en-
dosperm 
the  developing  embryo.  Even 
egg-laying  mammals  (i.e.,  monotremes)  show  imprinting 
in  suckling-related  genes.  However,  the  existence  of  im-
printed  genes  in  chicken (Gallus gallus)  is  controversial 
(Miguel et al.,  2004).  For  example, IGF2,  which  is  pater-
nally  expressed  in  marsupials  (e.g.,  possums)  and  mam-
mals,  is  not  similarly  expressed  in  birds  (Yokomine  et 
al.,  2005).  Nonetheless,  the  arrangement  and  substance 
of  the  chicken  genome  is  highly  conserved  in  many  hu-
man  imprinted  domains,  including  the  human  imprinted 
gene  cluster  that  contains  IGF2, H19, KCNQ1, ASCL2, 
and CDKN1C  (Rapkins  et al.,  2006).  If,  as  has  been 
suggested,  imprinted  genes  are  intimately  connected 
with  the  acquisition  of  parental  resources,  we  would  not 
anticipate  the  existence  of  such  genes  in  chicken,  which 
leave 
their  own  heritance  after 
conception.  Phylogenetic  analyses  expose  that  the  rela-
tionship  between  human  and  mouse  is  closer  than  that 
between  human,  mouse,  and  chicken.  Similarly,  the  rela-
tionship  between  zebrafish  and  chicken  is  quite  distant 
(Shah  et al.,  2004).  Nonetheless,  we  assumed  that 
chicken  have  imprinted  genes  due  to  the  existence  of 
common  ancestral  genomic  regions  that  have  evolved 
on  a  similar  basis  in  each  of  the  aforementioned 
species.  The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  identify  can-
didate  imprinted  genes  in  chicken  based  on  an  analysis 
of  orthologous  genes  in  human,  mouse,  zebrafish,  and 
chicken  using  the  HomoloGene  database.

Methods

Data  selection

Human,  mouse,  chicken,  and  zebrafish  were  selected  as 
our  experimental  units.  All  gene  expression  data  for 
these  species  were  compiled  into  a  CEL  file  using  the 
GEO 
(Gene  Expression  Omnibus)  database  at  the 
National  Center  for  Biotechnology  Information  (NCBI).  A 
list  of  imprinted  human  and  mouse  genes  were  obtained 
from  http://www.geneimprint.com/site/genes-by-species; 
the  probe  ID  and  name  of  each  gene  were  downloaded 
from  http://www.affymetrix.com/support/technical/annota-
tionfilesmain.affx  to  confirm  the  information.  All  data 
were  subsequently  compiled  in  HomoloGene  (ftp://ftp. 
ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/FTPsite/build57). 

Statistical  analysis

To  determine  how  strongly  the  various  data  were  con-
nected,  we  calculated  correlations  for  all  of  the  genes  in 
the  network  using  a  hard  cutoff,  with  1  signifying  an  ab-
solute  correlation  for  those  values  greater  than  0.5  and 
0  for  all  other  values.  We  then  summed  the  re-coded 
values  to  analyze  connectivity  strength.  The  data  were 
also  analyzed  using  nonparametric  statistical  tests.  To 
test  for  differences  between  each  pair  of  species,  we 
used  the  binomial  exact  test  and  the  Wilcoxon-Mann- 
Whitney  test.  We  also  computed  Spearman's  and 
Kendall's  correlation  coefficients  to  analyze  the  relation-
ships  between  pairs  of  species,  and  the  Kolmogor-
ov-Smirnov  test  was  used  to  confirm  differences  be-
tween  pairs  of  species.  Finally,  the  Friedman's  test  was 
used  to  identify  differences  between  more  than  three 
species.  All  statistical  tests  used  in  this  study  were  per-
formed  using  Python  and  statistical  package  R  (R-proj-
ect,  http://www.r-project.org/).

Results  and  Discussion

Identification  of  orthologous  genes  in  human, 
mouse,  chicken,  and  zebrafish  using  Homolo-
Gene 

Given  that  the  imprinted  genes  in  human  and  mouse  are 
known,  we  selected  them  as  our  experimental  units.  The 
imprinted  status  of  each  species  was  downloaded  from 
the  Internet  (http://www.geneimprint.com/site/genes-by- 
species).  Thirty  orthologous  imprinted  genes  were  found 
in  human  and  mouse.  We  next  used  the  HomoloGene 
database  to  search  for  homologous  genes  in  human, 
mouse,  and  chicken.  Of  the  24,  17,  and  seven  genes 
identified  in  the  three  species,  respectively,  six  were 
found  to  be  orthologous  (PPP1R9A, IGF2, SLC22A18, 
PHLDA2, UBE3A, and  GRB10;  Table  1).

Identification  of  candidate  imprinted  genes  in 
chicken

We  calculated  correlation  values  for  each  of  the  genes 
using  a  hard  cutoff,  and  then  summed  the  recoded  con-
nection  strengths,  as  shown  in  Table  1  (see  the  Mate-
rials  and  Methods).  From  this  result,  we  confirmed  five 
highly  conserved  orthologous  genes  (IGF2, SLC22A18, 
PHLDA2, UBE3A, and GRB10)  in  human,  mouse,  and 
chicken.  This  represents  the  average  connectivity  for 
identical  genes  with  different  probe  IDs.  We  next  com-
puted  connectivity  values  for  the  genes  in  each  species, 
and  found  that SLC22A18  was  not  orthologous  between 
human,  mouse,  and  chicken.  Consequently,  using  the 
binomial  exact  test,  we  identified  four  potential  im-
printed  genes  in  chicken  (IGF2, PHLDA2, UBE3A, and 
GRB10).

of  nonparametric  tests  with  zebrafish  added  to  the  list 
of  species.  No  probe  ID  was  identified  for UBE3A  in  ze-
brafish,  so  we  excluded  it  from  our  analysis.  To  test  for 
differences  in  distribution  between  each  pair  of  species, 
we  used  the  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney  test  and  the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test.  According  to  our  results, 
GRB10  was  different  chicken  and  human.  We  also  cal-
culated  Spearman's  and  Kendall's  correlation  coeffi-
cients  to  compare  the  relationships  between  each  pair 
of  species.  A  weak  relationship  was  identified  for 
PHLDA2  between  chicken  and  human,  which  reached  a 
significance  level  of  α=0.05  (Table  2).  Finally,  we  used 
the  Friedman's  test  to  compare  differences  in  associa-
tion  among  the  four  species. IGF2  was  not  significant  in 
any  case,  while  GRB10  was  not  significant  in  human, 
mouse,  and  chicken  (Table  3).

Comparison  of  our  data  with  comparative  data 

To  compare  our  data,  referred  to  as  comparative  data, 
we  computed  correlations  for  all  data  and  summed  the 
values.  We  considered  only  those  genes  that  were  re-
lated  to  chicken.  Based  on  the  Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney 
test  and  the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov  test, GRB10  was  dif-
ferent  chicken  and  zebrafish  using  our  data;  however,  it 
was  significant  using  comparative  data.  In  contrast, 
PHLDA2  was  different  chicken  and  mouse  using  our  da-
ta,  while  it  was  not  significant  using  comparative  data. 
Using  Spearman's  and  Kendall's  correlations,  PHLDA2 
was  shown  to  be  weakly  related  between  chicken  and 
human  using  our  data;  however,  no  correlation  was 
found  using  comparative  data.  Finally,  a  weak  correla-
tion  was  identified  for  GRB10  using  comparative  data, 
but  not  using  our  data.  The  Friedman's  test  for  IGF2 
produced  identical  results  regardless  of  whether  our  da-
ta  or  comparative  data  were  used,  but  for PHLDA2,  the 
result  of  comparative  data  was  not  the  same  for  hu-
