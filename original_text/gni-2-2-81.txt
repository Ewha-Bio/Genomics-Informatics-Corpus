Abstract 
To  examine  whether  the  IL-1A  (-889)  polymorphism 
associates with a risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
acts  interactively with  the  apolipoprotein  (APOE)  £4  in 
the  development  of  AD,  we  performed  genotype 
analyses of the  I L -1 A and the APOE of the  1 02  Korean 
AD patients and 200 Korean non-demented controls. We 
failed  to  detect a significant difference  in  genotypic and 
allelic  frequencies  of  IL-1A  between  the  AD  group  and 
control  group.  No  overexpression  of  the  IL-1A  CIT 
genotype and I L -1 AT allele was found when we analyzed 
the late-onset and early-onset patients, separately. There 
was  no  significant  genetic  interaction  between  IL-1A 
polymorphism and the APOE polymorphism. In conclusion, 
the 
IL-1A  polymorphism  did  not  contribute  to  the 
development of AD  independently  or  interactively with 
the APOE £4 allele in  Koreans.

Introduction 
lnterleukin-1  (IL-1), a potent acute phase proinflammatory 
cytokine,  is  known  to  play  an  important  role  in  the 
development of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  It was reported 
to  regulate  amyloid  beta  protein  (Aj3)  production  and 
increase the phosphorylation of tau  protein  (Sheng eta/., 
1996, 2000).  Its level was elevated in cerebral cortex and 
cerebrospinal  fluid  of  AD  patients,  and  activated  IL-1 
immunoreactive  microglia  were  also  proliferated 
significantly in the cerebral cortex of AD patients (Griffin et 
a/.,  1989; Cacabelos et at.,  1991). 

In 2000,  Grimaldi and his colleagues reported that the 
genetic  polymorphism  in  the  promoter  region  of  IL-1A 
(-889) was significantly associated with the risk of AD.  In 
their population, the IL-1A T allele conferred the risk of AD 
in dose-dependent manner. The odds ratios for AD in the 
IL-1A T-heterozygous  subjects  were  1.84  and  those  of 
IL-1A T-homozygous subjects were 6.33. The association 
of  AD  with  IL-1A  polymorphism  was  also  replicated  in 
several  other  populations  (Du  et at.,  2000;  Nicoll  eta/., 
2000;  Rebeck,  2000;  Combarros  eta/.,  2002;  Hedley et 
at.,  2002).  Moreover, 
this  polymorphism  might  be 
functional. The IL-1A TT genotype significantly increased 
the  transcriptional  activity  of  the  IL-1  alpha  gene  with 
respect to the CC genotype (Dominici eta/., 2002). 

However, there was substantial ethnic difference in the 
allelic  frequency  of  the  IL-1A  (-889)  T  and 
IL-1A 
T-conferred AD  risk.  While the frequency of the  IL-1A T 
was 17.8%-33% in Caucasians (Duet a/., 2000; Grimaldi 
et  a/.,  2000;  Minster  et  a/.,  2000;  Nicoll  et  a/.,  2000; 
Rebeck, 2000; Kolsch eta/., 2001; Combarros eta/., 2002; 
Fidani eta/., 2002; Green et at., 2002;  Hedley eta/., 2002; 
Pirskanen  et a/.,  2002),  it  was  less  than  11.3%  in  East 
Asians (Ki  eta/., 2001;  Kuo eta/., 2003; Tsai eta/., 2003) 
and  the  IL-1A  T-AD  association  was  not  significant  in 
Asians (Ki eta/., 2001; Kuo eta/., 2003; Tsai eta/., 2003). 
Therefore we investigated the association of AD with 
the 
its 
interaction with APOE polymorphism in the development 
of AD in Koreans. 

IL-1A  (-889)  polymorphism  and  examined 

Materials and Methods 
The  AD  patients were  selected  from  the  patients who 
had  visited  the  dementia  clinic  at  Seoul  National 
University  Hospital  and  from  the  community-dwelling 

82  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol.  2(2) 81-85, June 2004 

elderly individuals in three districts of Seoul (Kwanak-gu, 
Seocho-gu,  Nowon-gu).  All  the  non-demented  normal 
control  subjects  were  community-dwelling  elderly 
individuals randomly selected from those three districts. 
We  administered  the  Korean  version  of the  CERAD 
assessment  packet  (Lee  et  at.,  2002)  and  Modified 
Hachinski  Ischemic Score (MHIS) (Rosen eta/.,  1980) to 
all the subjects. Following this evaluation, a diagnosis for 
each  subject  was  made  at  a  consensus  meeting; 
diagnoses for dementia were made according to DSM-IV 
criteria  (APA,  1994)  and  diagnoses  for  probable  AD 
according  to  NINCDS-ADRDA  criteria  (McKhann  eta/., 
1984 ).  The  subjects who were  diagnosed as  cognitively 
normal and got less than 3 of MHIS were included in the 
normal  control  group.  Age-at-onset  was  defined  as  the 
age  at  which  the  patient  or  his  family  first  noticed  the 
symptoms required for the diagnosis. The cut-off between 
late-onset AD and  early-onset AD was  65 years of age. 
The  control  subjects  were  also  divided  into  the  young 
controls aged 64 years or less and the old controls aged 
65  years  or  over.  The  subjects  with  cerebrovascular 
disorders, neurologic disorders, and psychiatric disorders 
including  depression  were  excluded  from  the  patient 
group  as  well  as  the  control  group.  The  Institutional 
Review  Board  of  Seoul  National  University  Hospital, 
Korea, approved the study protocol and informed consent 
was obtained from all  participants or their guardians. 

Genomic  DNA  for  genotyping  was  extracted  from 
peripheral venous blood. IL -1 A ( -889) polymorphism was 
determined using a dynamic allele specific hybridization 
method  (DASH)  (Howell  et a/.,  1999). The polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) primers  (forward, 5'-TITTTACATAT 
GAGCCTTCAAT-3'; biotinylated reverse, 5'- TTAATAATAG 
T AACCAGGCAAC-3')  and  the  two  fluorescent  labeled 
probes  (5'-AGGCAACATCAT TGAAG-3'  and  5'-AGGC 
A  ACACCA TTGAAG-3'),  complementary  to  the  both 
allelic sequences of the IL-1A (-889) polymorphism, were 
added  to  a  96-well  microliter plate,  and  PCR  was  then 
performed.  After PCR,  the  plate was  placed  in  a DASH 

instrument (Hybaid ltd.) and heated from 35oC to 85oC at a 
rate  of  0.3°C/sec.  Probe-duplex  denaturation  was 
determined  by  the  decrease  in  fluorescence.  The  IL-1A 
(-889) genotypes were determined from the fluorescence 
curves  as  previously  described  (Howell  et  at.,  1999). 
APOE  genotyping  was  performed  using  a  slight 
modification  of the  method  reported  by  Wenham  et a/. 
(1991). 

The differences in both allele and genotype frequency 
between the AD  patients and the control  subjects were 
compared  using either a Fisher's exact test or Pearson 
Chi  square  test  when  appropriate.  Logistic  regression 
analyses  controlling  for  age  (age  at  onset  for  AD), 
gender and APOE genotype were performed to calculate 
the  odds  ratio  (OR)  associated  with  the  IL-1A  (-889) 
polymorphism on the risk for AD.  And  the age at onset 
between  groups  was  compared  using  Student  T  test. 
SPSS  version  10.0  for  Windows  was  used  for  these 
statistical analyses. 

Results 
A  total  of  1 02  sporadic AD  patients  and  200  controls 
were enrolled in this study. Among the 102 AD patients, 
34 subjects were early-onset AD patients (age at onset= 
58.8±3.7  years,  age  =  62.8±3.6  years,  range  =  54-71 
years,  58.3%  female)  and  68  subjects  were  late-onset 
AD  patients  (age  at  onset  =  75.3±35.9  years,  age  = 
78.3±5.8  years,  range  =  67-97  years,  67.6%  female). 
The 200 control subjects were also stratified by age into 
38 young controls (age= 60.8±3.0 years,  range= 53-64 
years,  89.5%  female)  and  162  old  controls  (age  = 
72.6±5.7 years,  range= 65-88 years, 72.8% female). 

There were no significant differences in the allelic and 
genotypic  frequencies  of  the 
IL-1A  polymorphism 
between the AD patients and control subjects (Table 1 ). 
The  distributions  of  the 
IL-1A  (-889)  and  APOE 
genotypes were  in  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  in  both 
the  AD  patients  and  controls.  The  frequency  of the  T

allele was  7.5%  in  our normal  elderly  :::ontrols,  and  the 
IL-1A T-homozygous subject was  not  :>bserved  in  both 
the  patient  group  and  control  group,  which  was  quite 
consistent  with 
in 
Koreans (Ki eta/., 2001 ). 

the  previously  rep1)rted 

results 

As expected, the APOE £4 was mor:J prevalent in the 
AD  patients than  in the controls (p<O.C 0001 ).  However, 
the  IL-1A T  allele  was  not  overrepre~ented in  the  AD 
group  compared  with  the  control  grcup  (P>0.1 ).  The 
IL-1A T-AD  association  was  not significant either after 
stratifying the subjects by the type of AD (Table 1) or the 
presence  of APOE  £4  allele  (Table  2).  The  age- and 
gender-adjusted odds ratio for AD conferred to the IL-1A 
Twas 0.61  (95%  C.l.  = 0.27- 1.37),  and  the interaction 
term  between  the  IL-1A  T  and  the  APOE  £4  was  not 
significant in logistic regression analysis. 

The  age-at-onset  was  not  influenced  by  the  IL-1A 
polymorphism.  The  mean  age-at-onset  of  the  AD 
patients  with  the  IL-1A C/C  genotype  (69.9±9.4  years) 
was not different from that of the AD patients with IL-1A 
CIT genotype (69.0±9.4 years). 

Discussion 
In  this  study,  we  did  not  find  a  significant  association 
between  the  IL-1A (-889)  polymorphism and  AD  risk  in 
Koreans,  which  is  consistent  with  the  three  previous 
studies on Asians (Ki  et at.,  2001; Kuo eta/., 2003; Tsai 
et  at.,  2003).  However,  the  absence  of  association 
between  the  IL-1A (-889)  polymorphism  and  AD  in  the 
present  study  is  not  merely  attributed  to  the  ethnic 
difference.  Five  out  of  the  11  previous  studies  on 
Caucasians  could  not  find  any  significant  association 
either (Minster eta/., 2000; Kelsch eta/., 2001;  Fidani et 
a/.,  2002;  Green  et at.,  2002;  Pirskanen  et at.,  2002). 
Therefore,  another factors  including  lack of power and 
linkage disequilibrium of IL-1A (-889) polymorphism with 
other nearby responsible gene on  chromosome 2 could 

be the sources of the conflicting results. 

The  frequency  of the  IL-1A T  allele  in  our controls, 
7.5%, was much lower than those of Caucasians which 
were  reported  to  be  17.8  %  - 33%  (Du  et  a/.,  2000; 
Grimaldi  eta/.,  2000;  Minster et at.,  2000;  Nicoll  eta/., 
2000;  Rebeck,  2000;  Kolsch  eta/., 2001;  Combarros et 
a/.,  2002;  Fidani et at.,  2002; Green eta/., 2002;  Hedley 
eta/., 2002;  Pirskanen eta/., 2002),  but it was similar to 
those of East Asians (7.1 %-11.3%; Ki eta/., 2001; Kuo et 
a/.,  2003;  Tsai  eta/.,  2003).  Therefore,  in  East Asians, 
much  larger sample  size  may  be  required  for verifying 
the  same  odds  ratio  for  AD  conferred  to  the  IL-1A  T 
compared with Caucasians. Because of this low T allele 
frequency  as  well  as  the  insufficient  sample  size,  the 
power of the  present  study was  65%  if we  considered 
that the odds of the IL-1A (-889) T allele for AD were 2. 
Moreover, there was no IL-1A T homozygous subject 
in  our sample.  Among  the  six previous  positive studies 
(Duet at.,  2000; Grimaldi eta/., 2000;  Nicoll eta/., 2000; 
Rebeck,  2000;  Combarros  eta/.,  2002;  Hedley  eta/., 
2002),  three  studies found  that  only TIT genotype was 
significantly associated with AD  risk (Nicoll  eta/., 2000; 
Rebeck,  2000;  Hedley  et  a/.,  2002).  Therefore  the 
association  between  AD  and  IL-1A TIT  in  Korean  was 
not examined in the present study, and waits for further 
investigation  in  an  extended  sample.  In  other  three 
studies  that  the  dose-dependent  AD  risk  conferred  to 
IL-1A T allele was confirmed (Duet at., 2000; Grimaldi et 
a/., 2000; Combarros eta/., 2002), the AD risks conferred 
to  IL-1A (-889)  CIT  genotype were  less than  2  (1.39  -
1.84).  This  modest  contribution  of  IL-1A  T  allele  may 
further complicate the power of present study. 

Age-at-onset  was  also  suggested 

(-889)  polymorphism  with  AD.  While 

to  be  a 
confounding  factor  to  influence  on  the  association  of 
IL-1A 
the 
association of AD  with  IL-1A (-889)  polymorphism was 
significant  only  in  early-onset  cases  in  Glimaldi  et  at. 
(2000)  and  Rebeck  (2000),  it  was  significant  only  in 

84  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 2(2) 81-85, June 2004 

late-onset cases in  Hedley et a/.  (2002).  Therefore,  the 
limited association of IL-1A (-889) polymorphism with AD 
according  to  age  at  onset  is  still  controversial.  In  the 
present  study,  the  association  of IL-1A (-889)  was  not 
found  either  in  the  early  onset  AD  patients  or  in  the 
late-onset AD patients. 

Combarros eta/. (2002) reported that in the presence 
of the APOE £4  allele the relative risk of IL-1A (-889) T 
allele carriers was approximately double the risk of IL-1A 
(-889}  T  allele  non-carriers.  However,  in  the  present 
study, the association of AD with the IL-1A (-889} Twas 
not significant regardless of the presence or absence of 
the APOE £4 allele.  Thus the absence of the AD- IL-1A 
(-889)  T  association  in  our  sample  was  not  a  biased 
result confounded by the APOE polymorphism. 

to 

In  conclusion,  we  failed 

find  any  evidence 
supporting  an  association  between  the  IL-1A  (-889) 
genetic polymorphism and AD in  Koreans.  We also did 
not find any significant association after the stratification 
according to age at onset or APOE genotype.
