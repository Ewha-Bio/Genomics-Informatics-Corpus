Abstract 

The  nucleotide  sequence  of pZM01 , a small  cryptic 
plasmid  of Zymomonas mobilis  ATCC1 0988  was 
determined.  Analysis  of 1 ,680  bp  of  sequence 
revealed  69  %  identity with  Shigella  sonnei  plasmid, 
pKYM  and  61  %  identity with  Nostoc  sp.  ss  DNA 
replicating plasmid. Analysis of a deduced amino acid 
sequence of an  orf of pZM01  revealed  75  %  identity 
and  90  %  similarity with  the repA  gene  of Syn(cid:173)
echocystis sp.  plasmid pCA2.4. The upstream region 
of the repA gene of pZM01  possesses six directed 
repeat sequences and two inverted repeat sequences 
at downstream of the IR consensus sequence of nick 
region  of rolling  circle  replication  (RCR)  plasmid.  A 
typical  terminator hairpin  structure  was found  at the 
downstream  region  of repA gene.  Degradation  of 
single-stranded  plasmid  DNA  by S1  nuclease  was 
detected  by Southern  hybridization.  It  suggests  that 
pZM01  replicates by a rolling circle mechanism in Z. 
mobilis ATCC1 0988 cells.

Introduction 

Zymomonas  is very interesting organisms because of their 
powerful  activity  in  ethanol  fermentation  (Skotnicki  eta/., 
1981)  by  the  Entner-Doudoroff  (ED)  pathway  (Swing  and 
De  Ley,  1977). Zymomanas  strains  have  plasmids  that

range  in  size  from  1 .4  kb  to  50  kb,  and  particularly Z. 
mobilis  ATCC10988  has  three  small  size  plasmids  and 
three  large  size  plasmids,  named  pZM01-pZM06  (1.7, 
1.9, 2.7,  7.3,  16.7, and 31.6kb in  size). The small plasmids 
(pZM02  and  pZM03)  of Z.  mobilis  ATCC  10988 were 
modified for E.  cali-Z.  mobilis shuttle vectors (Afendra and 
Drainas,  1987;  Scordaki  and  Drains,  1990).  And  some 
shuttle vectors were  developed to  introduce foreign  genes 
such  as  a cellulase  gene  (Brestic-Goachet et a/.,  1989), a 
~-carotene degrading  gene  (Misawa  et a/.,  1991)  into 
Zymomanas  to  overcome  their substrate  range.  The 
nucleotide  sequence  of  a 2.7  kb  plasmid  pZM03  of  Z. 
mobilis  ATCC10988  was  already  determined  (Misawa  et 
a/.,  1989). Two  arts  were  predicted  in  2749  bp  of  pZM03 
and its mobilization function was reported (Scordaki A., and 
Drainas C.,  1990; Afendra eta/., 1999). 

Results and Discussion 
Isolation and cloning of the pZM01 
Plasmids  from  Zymamonas  strains  have  been  reported, 
and  the  number  and  the  size  of Zymomonas  plasmids 
were strain-dependent (Skotnicki eta/., 1984). Six plasmids 
of Z.  mobilis ATCC1 0988  have been  reported  and  named 
pZM01-6  ranging  form  1.5kb  to  50kb  in  size.  But  in  this 
study,  five  plasmids  were  identified  on  1.0%  agarose  gel 
(Fig.  1A). The  sizes  of the  small  plasmids  were  estimated 
by comparison  to  the  commercial  E.  coli plasmids,  whose 
sizes  have  already  been  known.  Mobility  of  the  second 
small plasmid was similar to that of the pNEB193, a 2.7 kb 
plasmid.  The  size  and  the  nucleotide sequence of this  2.7 
kb  plasmid  have  previously  been  reported  as  pZM03 
(Scordaki,  and  Drains.  1990;  Misawa eta/.,  1989).  But 
pZM02 was  not found  in  our strain.  The  smallest plasmid 
pZM01  was  isolated  and  digested  with  restriction 
enzymes.  It  has  single  Haelll,  EcoRI,  Xbal,  EcoRV  and 
Spel  site.  £caRl-digested  pZM01  was  cloned  into  pBC 
SK+  to  give  pCZ4.  The  pCZ4  was  mapped  by  some 
restriction  enzymes  (Fig.  1 B).  Two  similar  size  plasmid 
pZM01-D  and  pZM02-D  (*D;  for  Drainas  C.,  Arvanitis  et 
a/.,  2000)  of Z.  mobilis  ATCC10988  have  been  reported. 
But  in  this  study,  only  single  fragment  was  detected  on 
agarose gel when the smallest plasmid band(s) was eluted 
and digested with some restriction enzymes.

pZM01  was  determined  (The  nucleotide  sequence  was 
numbered from  the Xbal  site)  (Fig.  2).  The  (G+C)  content 
was  38.75  %.  This  value  is  very  low  compared  to  the 
(G+C) content of the Z. mobilis ZM4 genome (about 46 %, 
Swing  et.  al.,  1977),  while  some  regions  of  plasmid 
sequence (from 1250 to 1680 nt) is relatively high (52.9 %). 
pZM01  sequence (pZM01-K, K for Kang H.L) was 1680bp 
that was  bigger than  that of pZM01-D and  pZM02-D (-D 
for  Drainas;  Arvantis  et a/.  2000).  Nucleotide  homology 
between  pZM01-K and  pZM02-D was  higher (94%)  than 
between  pZM01-K and  pZM01-D  (88%).  And  also  the 
size  of pZM02-D  was  closer to  pZM01-K (1669)  than 
pZM01-D (1651bp). The BLASTX program was also used 
to  search  the  homology  of  the  putative  amino  acid 
sequence.  The  result  of the  BLASTX search  showed that 
one  putative  open  reading  frame  (orf)  about a  1008  bp 
(241 nt-1238nt)  in  size  was  strongly  homologous  to  the

repA  gene  product  (replication  initiation  protein)  of  some 
bacterial  plasmid,  especially  the  Shigella  sonnei  plasmid 
pKYM  (74% identity)  (Croft  eta!.,  1983;  Kodaira  eta/., 
1995;  Sugiura eta/.,  1984)  and  Nostoc  species  ss  DNA 
plasmid (61  % identity). 

Genebank accession number 
The  DNA  sequence  of  pZM01  was  directly  submitted  to 
Genebank, Accession number AF030624. 

Alignment of the  pZM01  open  reading  frame 
with other proteins 
Many bacterial  replication  initiation  proteins  were  found  to 
be  homologous  to  the  pZM01-K open  reading  frame  by 
BLAST analysis  (Fig.  3).  The repA open  reading  frame  of 
Synechocystis  plasmid  pCA2.4  (Accession  number 

L 13739;  identities=45%,  similarities=64%),  ssDNA plasmid 
of Nostoc  (Accession  number  M81381;  identities=43% 
similarities=65%)  and  Shigella  sonnei  plasmid  pKYM 
(Accession  number  M38574;  identities  =54%,  similarity 
=71%)  were  very  homologous  to  that  of  pZM01-K repA. 
Although  amino  acid  sequence  of  pZM02-D  was  short 
(184  residue).  It was  more  homologous to  pZM01-K (334 
residue)  (identity  96%,  similarity  97%).  Amino  acid 
sequence homology between pZM01-D (348  residue)  and 
pZM01-K  (334  residue)  was  56%  identity and  72% 
similarity. Therefore,  pZM01-K thought to be a homolog of 
pZM02-D.  Orf  of  pZM01-K  has  three  conserved 
sequences,  region  I,  II  and  Ill.  Region  II  contained  motif 2 
of pC194 (del Solar eta!., 1998) that was thought to be the 
metal-binding  domain  of RepA  (Fig.  4).  Region  Ill  also 
contained motif 3 of pC194 RepA.

Analysis of the promoter region of repA 
In  1680 bp  of  a complete  DNA  sequence  of  the  pZM01 , 
1008 bp was revealed to be an orf for rep A. The nucleotide 
sequence from 1 to 240 was AT-rich {the G+C content was 
31.6%)  and  was  thought  to  be  a promoter  region  and 
possible  upstream  regulation  region.  Six  tandem  12  nt 
direct  repeated  sequences  (AAAAATAC  GGTC  repeat) 
were  found  from  sequence  33  to  104 without  intervening 
sequence.  Among  these  six  repeated  sequences,  five 
were  completely  identical  (A 1-A5),  but  the  last  one  A6 
{AAAAATACTTTAC)  was  not  identical  but very  similar to 
A 1-A5 repeats. One more inverted repeat {B1  and B2) was 
found  (Fig.  2)  right upstream of ATG  codon.  The  repeated 
sequence  of the  upstream  region  of the repA gene of the 
bacterial  plasmid  have  been  reported.  In  Erwinia  stewartii 
plasmid pSW500, these  repeated  sequences were named 
iterons,  which  serve  as  binding  sites  for the  regular  A 
protein and are required for the control of the plasmid copy 
number and  plasmid  incompatibility  (Fu  et at.,  1995).  In 
addition,  these  iterons  existed  in  the  origin  of  replication 
regions  of  many  plasmids  (Chattoraj  et at.,  1985).  Right 
downstream  of  A5  sequence,  one  conserved  sequence 
CTTGATA  of  pC194  nick  region  in  rolling  circle  (RC) 
replicons was found (del Solaret a/.,  1998). 

To prove the promoter sequence,  the putative promoter 
region  of  the  repA  gene  of  pZM01  was  tested  by  the 
promoter probing vector pRS415,  using the /acZ genes as 
a reporter system. About a 700 bp size upstream  region of 
repA  was  amplified  by the  PCR  method  and cloned Smal 
site  of  pRS415.  The  promoter activity  of  700  bp,  630  bp,

and  270  bp  of insert  DNA  fragments  that  were  excised 
from the PCR product were tested (Fig. 4). About one third 
of the transformants of three plasmid constructs generated 
blue  color.  The  plasmid  DNA that  was  prepared  from  the 
blue colonies generated about 700 bp,  630 bp, and 270 bp 
fragment,  respectively,  by  EcoRI  and  BamHI  double 
digestion.  About  half  of  white  colonies  also  had  insert 
fragments.  Those  white  colonies  might  resulted  from 
inserting the promoter fragment by reverse orientation  into 
the pRS415.  As a result of this test,  a minimum of 240 bp 
fragments  of  the  upstream  region  of repA  worked  as  a 
promoter. 

Analysis of the downstream region of repA

repA  is  very  low,  26%.  Furthermore,  this  region  revealed 
that  it  had  an  inverted  repeat  and  might  form  a hairpin 
structure  (Fig.  5).  Downstream  of  the  putative  hairpin, 
another AT-rich sequence {T3-sA3-s)) was found (Fig. 2). 

pZM01  replicates by a rolling circle mechanism 
The  DNA prepared  using the  rapid  agarose  block method 
(Borges, et at.,  1993) was electrophoresed and transferred 
to an NC membrane directly or after S1  nuclease treatment 
without  denaturation  (Yang,  et at.,  1996).  The  directly 
transferred  NC  membrane  could  absorb  only  the  ssDNA 
intermediate  of  pZM01 , and  generated  hybridized  signal 
by the pZM01  probe.  But the  S1  nuclease-treated sample 
did  not  show  any  hybridized  signal  at  all  by  the  pZM01 
probe.  The existence  of  ssDNA indicates that the  pZM01 
replicates  by a rolling  circle  mechanism  producing  ssDNA 
intermediate  (Fig.  6).  The  amino  acid  sequences  of  many 
small  plasmids  which  replicate  by  a  rolling  circle 
mechanism  exhibit  a strong  homology  with  the  RepA 
protein of pZM01  (Yasukawa, eta/., 1991 ).

Methods 
Bacterial strains, plasmids and culture conditions 
Z.  mobilis  ATCC10988  (type  strain;  Km'  Cm';  contains 
pZM01,  pZM03,  pZM04,  pZM05,  pZM06)  was  grown 
anaerobically at 30'C  in  RM  broth(10% glucose,  1% yeast 
extract)  supplemented  with  (NH4)2S04  (0.1 %),  KH2P04 
(0.2%)  and  MgS04  (0.1%)  (Skotnicki  et at.,  1981).  E.  coli 
DH10B  (F-,  mcrA,  (mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC)  80d/acZM15 
lacX74  deaR  recA1  endA1  araD139  (ara,  leu)7679  ga/U 
ga/K rpsl nupG)  E.  coli  was  cultured  in  LB  medium 
containing  appropriate  antibiotics.  Chloramphenicol, 
ampicillin,  streptomycin,  and  kanamycin  were  used  at  a 
final  concentration  of  34mg/ml,  50mg/ml,  50mg/ml  and 
50mg!ml  respectively.  The  cloning  vector  pNEB193  and 
pBC  SK+  were  purchsed  from  New  England  Biolabs  and 
Stratagene,  respectively.  pRS415  was  used  to  prove  the 
promoter region of the repA gene (Simon, et at,  1987). 

Preparation  of plasmids from Z.  mobilis ATCC 
1 0988 and recombinant techniques 
Z.  mobilis  ATCC10988 cells  were  grown  anaerobically for 
1 day in 200 ml  of RM  broth. The plasmids were extracted 
by the alkaline lysis method,  and then were further purified 
by CsCI  density gradient ultracentrifugation  (Sambrook,  et 
a/.,  1989).  DNA were  electrophoresed on  agarose gel  and 
transferred  to  the  nylon  membrane  by capillary  transfer 
method.  The  nylon  membranes  were  fixed  by  UV 
crosslinker  (Stratagene,  USA).  Probe  labelling  and  signal 
detection  were  carried  out  by the  enhanced  chemi(cid:173)
luminescence  (ECL)  method  (Amersham,  USA).  Other 

recombinant  DNA  techniques  were  performed  as 
described by J. Sambrook and D. W.  Russeltis (Sambrook, 
eta/., 1989). 

Detection of the promoter function 
A  set  of  oligomers  (REP-1:  5" -ATCGAACAAGGT  GATA(cid:173)
TTATTT-3",  REP-2:  5" -ATCATAGTGACCTTC  TTGGT(cid:173)
CAT -3")  were  designed to  amplify the  upstream  region  of 
the repA gene.  The 700bp PCR  product was purified by a 
PCR purification kit (Qiagen,  Germany) and  ligated into the 
Smal  site  of  the  pRS415  (Simons  RW.,  1987)  promoter 
probing  vector  to  give  pPro5.  The  PCR  product  was  also 
digested with  Spe/  or Xbal,  filled-in  with  Klenow fragment. 
630bp  or 270bp  fragments  were  eluted  and  also  ligated 
into  the  Sma/  site  of the  pRS415.  The  ligated  DNA  was 
transformed  into the  E.  coli  DH10B and spread  on  the  LB 
agar  plate  containing  50mg/ml  ampicillin  and  0.002%  X(cid:173)
Gal. 

Detection of the single stranded plasmid DNA 
Single-stranded  plasmid  DNA  was  detected  by  modified 
method  of  Yang  and  McFadden  (1993).  Well-grown  Z. 
mobilis ATCC10988 cells were harvested and lysed in  lysis 
buffer  (8%  sucrose,  50mM  EDT A,  0.1% Triton  X-1 00, 
50mM  Tris-HCI,  pH8.0,  1 Omg/ml  lysozyme,  1 00/.(g/ml 
RNase  A)  for  6hr at  37'C  and  then  treated  with  0.5mg/ml 
proteinase  K and  1%  sodium  N-laurlysarcosine  for  6hr  at 
55 'C.  Lysates  were  extracted  with  phenol  and  chloroform 
and  then  precipitated.  Twenty  microgram  of  DNA  was 
treated  with  5  unit of  S1  nuclease for  1 hr at 37'C.  Twenty 
microgram  of  S1  nuclease-treated  or untreated  DNA were 
subjected  to  1%  agarose  gel  electrophoresis  and  then 
transferred to a nylon  membrane in  1 ox sse without prior 
denaturation.  Probe  was  labelled  by  enhanced 
chemiluminescence  (ECL)  method  according  to  the 
manufacturer' s protocol (Amersham).
