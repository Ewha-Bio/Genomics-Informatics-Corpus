Abstract

identified  by 

Genome-wide  association  studies  (GWASs)  have  greatly 
contributed  to  the  identification  of  common  variants  re-
sponsible  for  numerous  complex  traits.  There  are,  how-
ever,  unavoidable  limitations  in  detecting  causal  and/or 
rare  variants  for  traits  in  this  approach,  which  depends 
on  an  LD-based  tagging  SNP  microarray  chip.  In  an  ef-
fort  to  detect  potential  casual  and/or  rare  variants  for 
complex  traits,  such  as  type  2  diabetes  (T2D)  and  trigly-
cerides  (TGs),  we  conducted  a  targeted  resequencing  of 
loci 
the  Korea  Association  REsource 
(KARE)  GWAS.  The  target  regions  for  resequencing 
comprised  whole  exons,  exon-intron  boundaries,  and 
regulatory  regions  of  genes  that  appeared  within  1  Mb 
of  the  GWA  signal  boundary.  From  124  individuals  se-
lected  in  population-based  cohorts,  a  total  of  0.7  Mb 
target  regions  were  captured  by  the  NimbleGen  se-
quence  capture  385K  array.  Subsequent  sequencing, 
carried  out  by  the  Roche  454  Genome  Sequencer  FLX, 
generated  about  110,000  sequence  reads  per  individual. 
Mapping  of  sequence  reads  to  the  human  reference  ge-
nome  was  performed  using  the  SSAHA2  program.  An 
average  of  62.2%  of  total  reads  was  mapped  to  targets 
with  an  average  22X-fold  coverage.  A  total  of  5,983 
SNPs  (average  846  SNPs  per  individual)  were  called  and 
annotated  by  GATK  software,  with  96.5%  accuracy  that 
was  estimated  by  comparison  with  Affymetrix  5.0  geno-
typed  data  in  identical  individuals.  About  51%  of  total 
SNPs  were  singletons  that  can  be  considered  possible 
rare  variants  in  the  population.  Among  SNPs  that  ap-
peared  in  exons,  which  occupies  about  20%  of  total 
SNPs,  304  nonsynonymous  singletons  were  tested  with 
Polyphen  to  predict  the  protein  damage  caused  by 
mutation.  In  total,  we  were  able  to  detect  9  and  6  po-

Introduction

(SNPs)  have  been  available 

Since  the  completion  of  the  Human  Genome  Project 
(Venter  et al.,  2001),  millions  of  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphisms 
for  under-
standing  the  pattern  of  the  human  genome  structure,  re-
sulting  in  the  construction  of  a  high-density  haplotype 
map  (International  HapMap  Consortium  2005).  These 
advances  in  genomics,  along  with  the  development  of 
high-throughput  and  high-density  microarray-based  gen-
otyping  platforms,  have  led  genome-wide  association 
(GWA)  studies  to  seek  genetic  variations  related  to  hu-
man  diseases.  Indeed,  GWA  studies  have  been  highly 
effective  in  identifying  common  variants  (MAF＞5%), 
showing  strong  evidence  of  association  with  complex 
−7)  (Cirulli  et al.,  2010). 
diseases  and  traits  (p＜5×10
Most  common  variants  identified  by  GWA  studies,  how-
ever,  have  shown  small  effects  on  disease  risk  (e.g., 
odds  ratio  of  1.2)  and  low  levels  of  heritability  (Aulchen-
ko et al.,  2009;  Cirulli et al.,  2010;  Zeggini et al.,  2008). 
These  limitations  in  GWA  studies  imply  that  additional 
genetic  variants  (such  as  rare  variants)  remain  to  be  de-
tected  to  explain  the  missing  heritability  of  complex 
traits.  GWA  studies  have  shown  an  additional  limitation 
in  identifying  causal  variants  for  complex  traits  as  well, 
since  this  approach  depends  highly  on  LD-based  tag-
ging  SNP  microarray  chips.
    Next-generation  sequencing  (NGS)  technologies,  such 
as  the  Illumina  Genome  Analyzer  (GA),  Roche/454  FLX 
system,  and  ABI  SOLiD  system,  recently  have  sig-
nificantly  improved  throughput  and  reduced  the  cost  re-
markably  as  compared  to  capillary-based  electropho-
resis  systems  (Shendure et al.,  2004).  For  example,  in  a 
single  experiment  using  the  Roche/454  FLX,  the  se-
quences  of  approximately  100  million  reads  of  up  to 
350  bases  in  length  can  be  determined  (Rothberg et al., 

132    Genomics  &  Informatics    Vol.  8(3)  131-137,  September  2010

2008).  Therefore,  NGS  technologies  are  regarded  as  one 
of  many  revolutionary  methods  of  large-scale  personal 
genome  sequencing.  In  this  regard,  NGS  technologies 
are  highly  attractive  for  overcoming  the  limitations  of 
GWASs  by  providing  a  way  of  fine-mapping  to  identify 
causal  and/or  rare  variants.  Some  rare  sequence  var-
iants  revealed  to  date  by  whole  genome  sequencing  or 
targeted  sequencing  using  NGS  technologies  have  been 
reported  for  their  association  with  rare  diseases,  such 
as  Mendelian  disorders  (Ng et al.,  2010),  while  a  few  are 
associated  with  complex  diseases,  such  as  type  2  dia-
betes  (T2D)  in  the  large-scale  population. 
    Recently,  we  conducted  the  Korea  Association  RE-
source  (KARE)  project,  the  first  Korea  GWA  study  for 
complex  diseases,  including  T2D,  as  well  as  for  various 
quantitative  traits,  including  anthropometric  and  blood 
biochemical  traits  (Cho  et al.,  2009).  From  the  KARE 
GWA  study,  we  were  able  to  identify  numerous  sig-
nificant  genome-wide  common  loci  for  diverse  complex 
traits.  Most  of  those  loci,  however,  showed  small  effects 
on  the  traits  of  interest-even  no  functional  relevance  to 
the  traits.  Thus,  in  the  hope  of  understanding  missing 
heritability  for  complex  traits  of  interest,  we  extended 
our  findings  from  the  KARE  GWA  study  to  the  detection 
of  causal  and/or  rare  variants  by  performing  targeted  re-
sequencing  using  the  Roche  454  Genome  Sequencer 
(GS)  FLX  instrument  in  124  individuals,  selected  from 
Korean  population-based  cohorts.

Methods

Samples

For  targeted  resequencing,  samples  were  selected  from 
two  population-based  cohorts,  the  Ansung  and  Ansan 
cohorts,  which  were  initiated  as  a  part  of  the  Korean 
Genome  Epidemiologic  Study  (KoGES)  in  2001.  Sample 
selection  was  stratified  to  three  groups  in  order  to  in-
crease  the  chances  of  identifying  causal  and/or  rare  var-
iants  for  T2D  and  plasma  triglycerides.  Group  1  samples 
included  40  T2D  patients,  diagnosed  by  2006  WHO 
guidelines.  Group  2  samples  included  42  nondiabetic  in-
dividuals,  selected  from  the  lower  quartile  of  fasting 
plasma  triglycerides  (TGs)  (44-56  mg/dl)  in  the  study 
cohorts.  Group  3  samples  comprised  42  individuals,  se-
lected  from  the  upper  quartile  of  fasting  plasma  TGs 
(321-395  mg/dl)  in  the  study  cohorts.  Thus,  Group  2 
samples  were  considered  as  common  controls  for 
Group  1  T2D  cases  as  well  as  for  Group  3  samples, 
which  had  high  levels  of  plasma  TGs.  About  5μg  of 
genomic  DNA  per  individual  was  used  for  subsequent 
targeted  sequence  capture  and  sequencing  experiments. 

Targeted  capture  and  sequencing

Target  regions  for  resequencing  comprised  the  whole 
exon,  exon-intron  boundary,  and  regulatory  region  (10 
kb  upstream  from  the  transcription  start  site)  of  genes 
that  appeared  within  1  Mb  of  the  GWA  signal  boundary 
for  complex  traits,  such  as  T2D  and  TG.  Adding  genes 
for  BMI,  waist-hip  ratio  (WHR),  and  bone  density,  based 
on  the  KARE  study  results,  a  total  of  45  genes,  covering 
about  670  kb,  were  selected  as  targets  for  resequencing 
(Table  1).  To  capture  the  targeted  regions,  the  Nimble-
Gen  Sequence  Capture  385K  array  method  was  applied 
(NimbleGen,  Madison,  WI,  USA).  Sequencing  of  capture 
regions  was  carried  out  by  the  Roche  454  GS  FLX  se-
quencer  on  a 
(Roche,  Basel, 
Switzerland)  according  to  the  manufacturer's  protocols. 
Image  analysis  and  base  calling  were  performed  using 
the  GS  FLX  pipeline  software  (version  2.3)  with  default 
parameters.

Read  mapping

Human  genome  UCSC  hg18  was  used  as  the  reference 
for  the  mapping  of  reads  produced  from  sequencing 
experiments.  Mapping  of  sequence  reads  to  the  human 
reference  genome  was  performed  using  the  SSAHA2 
(version  2.5.2)  program.  The  reference  human  genome 
was  formatted  by  SSAHA2  using  parameters  -454  for 
indexing/hashing  before  mapping.  The  mapping  of  se-
quence  reads  to  the  formatted  reference  was  performed 
using  SSAHA2.  The  best  mapping  per  read  was  de-
termined  using  the  parameters  -454 -best 1.  Mapped 
reads  were  changed  to  Binary  Sequence  Alignment/Map 
(BAM)  format  by  samtools  (version  0.1.8)  using  the  pa-
rameters view -bt.  Mapping  results  were  recalibrated  by 
the  GATK  program  using  the  parameters  -cov Quality-
scoreCovariate -cov DinucCovariate.

Variant  calling

The  GATK  module,  unified  genotyper,  was  used  for  var-
iant  calling  via  a  two-step  procedure.  In  the  first  step, 
a  raw  variant  call  was  generated  with  the  parameters 
--platform ROCHE454 -confidence 50 --heterozygosity 
1.000000e-03 -stand_call_conf 30.0.  In  the  second  step, 
a  filtered  variant  call  was  produced  with  the  parameters 
--filterExpression "QUAL＜30.0 II AB＞0.75 && DP＞40 II 

QD＜5.0 II HRun＞5 II SB＞−0.10". 

Accuracy  test  for  sequence  calls

As  an  accuracy  test,  some  of  the  total  sequence  calls 
generated  from  124  individuals  were  compared  with

Results  and  Discussion

The  GWA  study  has  been  considered  a  highly  reliable 
method  of  identifying  genetic  markers  associated  with 
complex  traits.  However,  it  is  usually  agreed  that  GWA 
studies  have  limitations  in  understanding  the  total  herit-
ability  for  a  given  complex  trait  (Manolio et al.,  2009).  In 
an  effort  to  explain  the  missing  heritability  of  complex 
traits,  the  identification  of  causal  variants  and  rare  var-
iants  is  a  choice,  along  with  the  identification  of  struc-
tural  variants,  such  as  copy  number  variation  (CNV)  and 
epigenetic  modifications. 
    Currently,  we  conducted  a  KARE  GWA  study  for  nu-
merous  complex  traits,  including  T2D  and  fasting  plas-

ma  triglycerides  (TGs).  To  detect  causal  variants  and 
rare  variants  for  T2D  and  TGs,  we  performed  targeted 
resequencing  for  genes  located  within  a  1  Mb  region  of 
SNPs  identified  in  the  KARE  GWA  study  for  their  strong 
evidence  of  association  with  T2D  or  TGs.  Exons,

gions,  we  also  included  regions  for  BMI,  WHR,  and 
bone  density  for  targeted  resequencing.  Samples  for  se-

first  exon)  were

quencing  included  40  T2D  cases  (Group  1),  42  non-
diabetic  individuals  with  low  TGs  (Group  2),  and  42  in-
dividuals  with  high  TGs  (Group  3).  Group  2  samples 
were  used  as  controls  for  T2D  case  samples  as  well  as 
high-TG  samples  in  this  study  (see  METHODS). 
    The  overall  study  involved  several  steps,  such  as  tar-
get  region  capture,  sequencing,  mapping,  SNP  calling, 
SNP  annotation,  and  functional  prediction  of  identified 
SNPs  with  an  in silico  tool  (Fig.  1).  Target  regions  for 
the  sequence  capture  included  41  genes  covering  a  to-
tal  size  of  670  kb  (Table  1).  Sequencing  for  captured  re-
gions  with  the  Roche  454  Genome  Sequencer  FLX  gen-
erated  an  average  of  about  108,317 
(one 
read=300-350  bp)  per  individual  (Table  2).  Sequence 
reads  that  passed  the  initial  quality  criteria  were  aligned 
to  the  reference  human  genome  (hg18)  using  the 
SSAHA2  (version  2.5.2)  program.  It  is  estimated  that 

reads 

62.2%  of  the  reads  were  mapped  to  the  target  region 
(Table  2),  with  a  fold  coverage  of  22X  (Fig.  2).  For  ex-
ample,  the  mean  depth  information  of  the  targeted 
gene,  HSD11B1,  on  chromosome  1  in  all  3  groups  is 
demonstrated  in  Fig.  3. 
    Sequence  variant  (single  nucleotide  polymorphism, 
SNP)  calling  was  carried  out  by  the  GATK  unified  geno-
typer  module.  The  quality  criteria  for  variant  calling  were 
10X  coverage  by  reads  and  base  calls  with  a  Phred-like 
quality  score  greater  than  30  (Ewing  and  Green.  1998). 
The  GATK  Genomic  Annotator  module  was  applied  to 
SNP  annotations,  based  on  UCSC  hg18  and  dbSNP 
build  130,  generating  information,  such  as  dbSNP  rs  ID, 
SNP  location,  and  SNP  function.  A  total  of  5,983  var-
iants  (average  846  variants  per  individual)  were  called 
and  successfully  passed  our  variation  quality  criteria. 
Seventeen  percent  of  the  annotated  SNPs  have  not

been  reported  in  the  dbSNP  database  and  are  regarded 
as  novel  SNPs  (Table  3).  An  average  of  168  of  the  846 
SNP  calls  per  individual  appeared  in  exon  regions,  of 
which  31  SNPs  (18.21%)  were  nonsynonymous  SNPs 
that  can  lead  amino  acid  changes  (Table  3). 
    The  accuracy  of  sequence  calls  was  estimated  by 
comparing 
them  with  array-based  genotype  data 
(Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0)  in  the 
identical  individual.  Concordance  rates  were  97.95%  in 
the  homozygous  reference,  95.99%  in  the  homozygous 
nonreference,  and  95.46%  in  the  heterozygous  genotype 
(Table  4). 
    We  counted  genetic  variants  that  were  shared  in  each 
individual.  About  51%  of  the  total  SNP  calls  (3,049 
SNPs)  were  singletons  (Fig.  4).  To  detect  novel  SNPs 
that  can  influence  T2D  and  TGs,  we  selected  304  non-
synonymous  SNPs,  identified  from  candidate  genes  for 
T2D  and  TGs,  and  tested  their  relevance  to  the  function 
of proteins-the expression products of candidate genes-by 
in  silico  functional  analysis.  Analyses  by  PolyPhen

(Sunyaev et al.,  2001)  predicted  9  novel  nonsynonymous 
singleton  SNPs  for  T2D  and  6  for  TGs  that  showed  po-
tentially  damaging  effects  on  candidate  gene  products 
for  T2D  and  TGs  (Table  5).  Thus,  it  is  considered  that 
these  SNPs  are  potentially  causal  and  rare  variants, 
possibly  influencing  T2D  and  fasting  plasma  TG  levels.
