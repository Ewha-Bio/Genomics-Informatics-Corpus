Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are involved in 
diverse  biological  processes,  including  the  control  of  cell 
proliferation and differentiation. Accordingly, a number of 
studies  have  reported  that  altered  miRNA  expression  is 
related  to  tumor  cell  growth,  invasion,  and  metastasis. 
Recent studies have revealed that tumor-associated miRNAs 
are present in human plasma and serum, suggesting that 
plasma miRNAs can be useful non-invasive biomarkers. In 
this issue, Dr. Yong Sung Kim’s group (KRIBB) measured the 
plasma expression levels of three miRNAs to investigate the 
usefulness  of  miRNAs  for  gastric  cancer  detection.  DNA 
microarray techniques have been widely used in biological 
research  to  understand  the  pathobiology  of  diseases. 
Microarray experiments also enable researchers to identify 
gene sets undergoing a response to a specific stimulus, as 
well as to analyze dynamic responses at the level of the gene 
regulatory  network.  Prof.  Sangsoo  Kim’s  group  (Soongsil 

University) has constructed an insulin-mediated regulatory 
network  by  using  published  gene  expression  microarray 
datasets of human skeletal muscle samples. In this issue, 
based  on  a  motif  discovery  method,  they  developed  a 
regulatory  network  for  insulin-mediated  genes  by  inte-
grating  methods  based  on  TF  binding  motifs  and  gene 
expression  variations.  The  development  of  transgenic 
biotechnologies has led to safety concerns regarding gene-
tically  modified  organisms,  particularly  in  food  crops.  Ik- 
young  Choi’s  group  (Seoul  National  University)  demon-
strated  the  success  of  NGS  data  in  characterizing  the 
genetically  modified  rice  genome. There  are  three  intere-
sting  and  informative  application  notes  in  this  issue:  ‘A 
Database  of  Gene  Expression  Profiles  of  Korean  Cancer 
Genome,’  ‘VBioindex:  A  Visual  Tool  to  Estimate  Biodi-
versity,’ and ‘A Frequency Profile of the ChromHMM Pro-
moter States.’
