Asian populations contain a variety of ethnic groups that have ethnically specific genetic differences. Ethnic variants may be 
highly  relevant  in  disease  and  human  differentiation  studies.  Here,  we  identified  ethnically  specific  variants  and  then 
investigated their distribution across Asian ethnic groups. We obtained 58,960 Pan-Asian single nucleotide polymorphisms 
of  1,953  individuals  from  72  ethnic  groups  of  11  Asian  countries.  We  selected  9,306  ethnic  variant  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms (ESNPs) and 5,167 ethnic variant copy number polymorphisms (ECNPs) using the nearest shrunken centroid 
method. We analyzed ESNPs and ECNPs in 3 hierarchical levels: superpopulation, subpopulation, and ethnic population. We 
also identified ESNP- and ECNP-related genes and their features. This study represents the first attempt to identify Asian ESNP 
and ECNP markers, which can be used to identify genetic differences and predict disease susceptibility and drug effectiveness 
in Asian ethnic populations.

Introduction

There has been an explosion of data describing genetic 
variants in humans. Structural genetic variations, such as 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number 
variations (CNVs), have given rise to myriad differences in 
human  populations  [1].  The  study  of  human  genetic 
variations has both evolutionary significance  and medical 
applications  and  can  help  scientists  understand  ancient 
human  population  migrations  as  well  as  how  different 
human groups are biologically related to one another [2, 3]. 
SNPs  represent  the  most  frequent  type  of  human  DNA 
variation  [4].  The  main  goals  of  SNP  research  include 
understanding the genetics of the human phenotype varia-
tion and, especially, the genetic basis of human diseases [5, 
6]. Genome-wide linkage and association studies have been 
made possible by highly accurate methods for typing SNPs 
[7].  CNV  is  a  form  of  genomic  structural  variation  that 

results in the cell having an abnormal number of copies of 
one or more sections of DNA [8]. CNVs can be limited to a 
single gene or include a contiguous set of genes. CNVs can 
result in having either too many or too few dosage-sensitive 
genes, which may be responsible for a substantial amount of 
human phenotypic variability, complex behavioral, traits and 
disease  susceptibility  [9].  A  copy  number  polymorphism 
(CNP) is a CNV that occurs in more than 1% of the po-
pulation [10]. SNP platforms can also be used for typing 
CNVs. This allows for generalized genotyping of both SNPs 
and CNVs simultaneously on a common sample set, with 
advantages in terms of cost and unified analysis. Although 
CNP detection from SNP genotyping data is a difficult task 
and has the limitation of false positive results, it will provide 
a  more  comprehensive  view  of  genomic  variations  and 
complement genome-wide association studies in identifying 
disease susceptibility loci.

SNPs are being used in studies of human migration and

evolution, as well as those of human health. The Human 
Genome Organization (HUGO) Pan-Asian SNP Consortium 
reported a large-scale survey of autosomal variations from a 
broad geographic sample of 72 Asian human populations 
[11].  The  study  indicated  that  most  populations  show 
relatedness within ethnic or linguistic groups, despite signi-
ficant gene flow among groups. This relatedness may have 
important  implications  for  our  understanding  of  genetics 
and  disease.  Data  on  ethnic  populations  in  the  Pan-Asia 
region can be valuable to show the spectrum of genetic diver-
sity and networks of ethnic groups. Thus, notwithstanding 
the  population  size  problem  in  some  ethnic  groups,  we 
investigated the ethnic specificity based on SNP and CNP 
information. Here, we identified genetic variations－ethni-
cally  specific  SNPs  (ESNPs)  and  ethnically  specific  CNPs 
(ECNPs)－of  Asian  populations  using  SNP  genotypic 
profiling. These ESNP and ECNP markers can be used to 
identify genetic differences and to predict disease suscep-
tibility and drug effectiveness in Asian populations.

Methods
Dataset

We obtained a genome-wide 58,960-SNP dataset (Affy-
metrix  GeneChip  Human  Mapping  50K  Xba  chip;  Affy-
metrix  Inc.,  Santa  Clara,  CA,  USA)  from  the  HUGO 
Pan-Asian SNP Consortium website (http://www4a.biotec. 
or.th/PASNP) [12]. The SNP data were obtained from 1,833 
individual DNA samples collected from blood and buccal 
samples of 72 Asian and non-Asian ethnic groups. Filtering 
SNPs  is  an  important  step  in  genome-wide  studies  to 
minimize  potential  false  findings.  We  filtered  SNPs  at  2 
levels: individual and SNP. In the individual-level filtering 
step, we removed individual SNPs that had a ＜90% geno-
typing  call  rate  and  that  were  not  in  Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium (p ＜ 0.001). We filtered out 89 of the initial 
1,833 individuals and used SNPs from the 1,744 individuals 
for further study. In the SNP-level filtering step, 1,692 of the 
initial 58,960 SNPs were filtered out, because 389 SNPs had 
an  SNP  call  rate  below  90%,  451  SNPs  were  physically 
unmapped, 103 SNPs could not be mapped to dbSNP, and 
749 SNPs were monomorphic. Finally, we obtained 56,025 
SNP markers from 1,744 genotyped individuals, represen-
ting  72  ethnic  groups  in  the  HUGO  Pan-Asian  SNP 
Consortium.

For comparison with other ethnic variants, we obtained 
SNPs of 209 HapMap individuals representing 4 populations 
(China Han [CHB]; Japan Japanese [JYP]; USA European 
[CEU];  Africa  Yoruba  [YRI])  (http://www.hapmap.org/). 
The 243 SNPs in the HUGO Pan-Asian with the HapMap 
dataset were nonshared SNP loci and excluded.

Haplotype phasing by fastPHASE

Phasing  is  needed  to  determine  which  variants  are  in-
herited by an individual at each locus and to more accurately 
determine the relationships between unrelated individuals 
in large population datasets. Using phasing population data, 
we can identify haplotypes, which are essentially segments 
of DNA that are common to a particular ethnic group. The 
fastPHASE program version 1.1.4 [13] was used to estimate 
missing  genotypes  and  reconstruct  haplotypes  from 
unphased  SNP  genotype  data  of  unrelated  individuals  in 
order to identify ethnicity-specific SNPs.

Analysis of CNPs

SNP genotyping arrays recently have been used for CNP 
detection and analysis, because  the  arrays  can serve dual 
roles for SNP- and CNV-based association studies. To detect 
CNP  markers  from  the  SNPs,  we  used  the  Affymetrix 
Genotyping Analysis Software and Copy Number Analysis 
Tool (CNAT version 3.0), which was downloaded from the 
Affymetrix website (http://www.affymetrix.com/products/ 
software). We calculated the distribution of genomic smoo-
thing copy number signal intensity (upper-boundary = 2.78, 
lower-boundary = 1.51) to detect the CNPs (Supplementary 
Fig. 1). We regarded markers with values beyond the upper- 
and lower-boundary values as CNVs. Then, we selected the 
CNPs that presented variation in ＞1% of the individuals as 
CNVs that occurred in more than 1% of the population [14]. 
We  downloaded  the  detection  tools  from  the  website 
(http://www.affymetrix.com/products/software) and used 
these programs for our Pan-Asian SNP data. We regarded 
markers  with  values  outside  of  the  upper-  and  lower- 
boundary values as CNVs. Then, we selected CNPs which 
presented variation in ＞1% of the 1,196 individuals.

Selection of ethnicity-specific genetic variations: 
ESNPs and ECNPs

To  investigate  the  distribution  of  ESNP  and  ECNP 
markers  in  Pan-Asian  ethnic  groups,  we  performed  the 
following steps, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. First, we 
classified the ethnic groups into 3 hierarchical categories by 
population  estimation  of  the  phylogenic  analysis  (in 
Supplementary Fig. 2): superpopulation (clustering size = 
4),  subpopulation  (ESNP  clustering  size  =  12,  ECNP 
clustering size = 11), and ethnic population (ESNP clus-
tering size = 72, ECNP clustering size = 60). The clustering 
size in parentheses refers to how many distinct populations 
were  used  in  the  ESNP  and  ECNP  analysis.  The  super-
populations  consisted  of  African,  Caucasian,  American 
Indian, Asian, and outlier (Indian and Uyghur) populations. 
The subpopulations comprised population groups based on

linguistic  similarities  and  population  structures  and  2 
additional groups (Mongoloid features [IN-NI]/Mongoloid 
features  [IN-TB]  and  China  Uyghur  [CN-UG]),  and  the 
ethnic populations represented each ethnic group. Second, 
we identified ethnicity-specific variations based on SNPs and 
CNPs markers using the nearest shrunken centroid method 
(NSCM), which is not affected by the minor-allele frequency 
[15,  16].  The  NSCM  of  the  R  package  pamr  carried  out 
multiple tests for genetic heterogeneity and frequency spec-
trum on genes having ethnicity-specific variants. It shrinks 
each of the class centroids toward the overall centroid for all 
classes by a threshold. This shrinkage makes the classifier 
more  accurate  by  eliminating  the  effect  of  noise.  This 
method is a suitable attempt to solve the classification pro-
blem when there are a large number of features from which 
classes and a relatively small number of cases are predicted, 
and it is a significant approach to identify which features 
contribute most to the classification [15]. Third, we iden-
tified specific ethnic groups that correlated with each SNP or 
CNP. Finally, to investigate the characteristics of ethnicity- 
specific variations, we obtained the top 10% of ESNPs and 
ECNPs markers.

Functional analysis of ESNP and ECNP markers

To investigate the characteristics of the ECNP- and ESNP- 
related  genes,  we  selected  the  ECNP  and  ESNP  markers 
ranked in the top 1% of the ethnically specific variations. We 
mapped ESNP and ECNP markers to gene structure, based 
on  Entrez  gene-centered  information  at  NCBI  [16].  We 
identified the relationships among ESNP- and ECNP-genes 
using the Ingenuity Systems Pathway Analysis tool (http:// 
www.ingenuity.com), which is a web-based tool for pathway 
and network analysis of genes.

Results and Discussion
Genotype features

We obtained 58,960 Pan-Asian SNPs from 72 Pan-Asian 
populations listed in the supplementary documents (Sup-
plementary Table 1). The SNP dataset shows the spectrum of 
genetic and phenotypic diversity in Asian populations and 
allows us determine the ethnic specificity of Asian popu-
lations based on ESNP and CNP makers.

We  devised  an  approach  to  identify  ethnic  differences 
from  the  genotype  profiles  of  the  populations.  Pan-Asian 
SNPs  were  filtered  using  several  steps,  as  described  in 
Materials  and  Methods.  With  the  filtered  SNPs,  we  exa-
mined the inter-SNP distances, the allele frequency, and the 
heterozygosity  distribution  to  identify  the  genotypic  fea-
tures of each ethnic group. The average inter-SNP distance 
was 52 kb. More than 41% of SNPs fell below 10 kb, and 14% 

was  over  100  kb  (Supplementary  Fig.  3).  The  inter-SNP 
distance distribution within 10 kb of one another was similar 
to the distribution observed in the HapMap data.

We  investigated  minor  allele  frequency  and  hetero-
zygosity across the ethnic groups (Supplementary Fig. 4). 
We compared SNP genotypes in the ethnic groups with those 
identified by the HapMap [17] consortium. The proportion 
of  Pan-Asian  SNPs  in  each  minor  allele  frequency  and 
heterozygosity range was similar to those of the 4 HapMap 
ethnic groups. In particular, the SNP proportions for CN- 
UG,  Proto-Austroloids  (IN-DR),  and  Singapore  Indian 
(SG-ID) were almost the same as those of the 4 HapMap 
ethnic  groups.  We  found  that  5  ethnic  groups  (America 
Melanesians  [AX-ME],  Thailand  Mlabri  [TH-MA],  Indo-
nesia Mentawai [ID-MT], CN-UG, and SG-ID) had minor 
allele frequency and heterozygosity distributions that were 
significantly  different  from  those  of  other  ethnic  groups. 
Approximately 40% of the SNPs in the AX-ME, TH-MA, and 
ID-MT populations fell into the ＜0.05 range. The propor-
tion of SNPs with heterozygosity ＜0.05 was lowest in the 
CN-UG and SG-ID groups, whereas the proportion of SNPs 
with heterozygosity ＜0.10 was highest in the TH-MA and 
AX-ME groups.

Distribution of ESNPs and ECNPs

We  confirmed  the  high  proportion  of  African  (YRI)- 
specific SNPs from 3 races: Asian, Caucasian, and African 
(Supplementary  Fig.  5).  Then,  to  search  ESNPs  from 
Pan-Asian ethnic groups, we identified 9,306 ESNPs from 
the Pan-Asian SNP markers and examined the distribution of 
the ESNPs at the 3 population levels: super-, sub-, and ethnic 
population (Fig. 1A). We found that 67.82% of ESNPs in the 
superpopulation level were others, including IN-NI, IN-TB, 
and CN-UG. It could show that isolated ethnic groups keep 
their  original  features  and  that  these  features  are  also 
presented in other population levels. In the subpopulations, 
Austronesian,  IN-NI,  and  IN-TB  had  95.31%  of  ESNPs. 
Additionally, we identified 28,282 CNPs based on the SNP 
chip  profiles  and  then  selected  5,167  ECNPs.  We  then 
examined the ECNPs in the 3 population levels (Fig. 1B). In 
the  superpopulations,  36.57%  of  the  ECNPs  occurred  in 
Caucasoids.  Of  the  subpopulation  ECNPs,  56.26%  had 
Mongoloid features and 36.95% occurred in Uyghurs. Across 
the  ethnic  groups,  26.35%  of  the  ECNPs  were  from 
Caucasoids  (IN-NL).  Most  ECNPs  occurred  in  Caucasoid 
populations  (IN-NL,  IN-IL,  IN-DR,  IN-SP,  IN-EL,  IN-WI, 
IN-WL, and SG-ID) and in ethnic groups that have Mon-
goloid  features  (IN-NI,  IN-TB,  and  CN-UG).  The  ethnic 
group  having  Mongoloid  features  had  more  ECNPs  than 
other  groups,  which  shows  that  Pan-Asian  ECNPs  could 
serve  as  the  criteria  for  ethnic  specificity  in  Pan-Asian

The features of genes associated with ESNPs and 
ECNPs

We  obtained  genes  associated  with  ESNPs  and  ECNPs 
based on the NCBI Gene database [18]. We identified 156 
ESNP-related  genes  and  52  ECNP-related  genes  (Supple-
mentary Table 2). Most of the ESNP-containing genes were 
associated  with  known  molecular  functions  encoded  for 
cellular assembly and maintenance, cellular movement, cell 
death and survival, and lipid metabolism (Table 1). These 
ESNP-related gene sets (CEP192, GRK5, TUBGCP3, TUBGCP6, 
ABCA1, CHGA, ITGB3, VAV2, MYLK3, ANK2, ITGB3, ELN, 
LTBP4,  FAM107B,  DIDO1,  HOXD3,  PRPX2,  KCNMA1, 
RASGRF1,  NF1,  and  UBR2)  showed  association  with 
diseases,  such  as  cardiovascular  disease,  dermatological 
diseases  and  conditions,  developmental  disorders,  and 
connective tissue disorders. Defects in latent transforming 
growth factor beta binding protein 4 (LTBP4) may be a cause 
of  cutis  laxa  and  severe  pulmonary,  gastrointestinal,  and 
urinary abnormalities [19]. Centrosomal protein 192 kDa 
(CEP192) is part of a large multisubunit complex required 
for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome. This gene is 
regulated by hepatitis B virus and has roles in cells, such as 
duplication,  replication,  assembly,  and  nucleation.  The 

ECNP-related genes are associated with known molecular 
functions encoded for cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, 
molecular transport, and drug metabolism (Table 1). These 
ECNP-containing genes (ARID1B, CAPN7, DDR2, SLC22A1, 
SLC22A3, ASTN2, GABRA5, GABRG3, RBFOX1, TLR4, MAG, 
TLR4, SNX9, and SYNJ2) are associated with cardiovascular 
disease, neurological disease, psychological disorders, and 
developmental disorders. Interestingly, the APOBEC gene, 
encoding  the  C→U  editing  enzyme  family,  such  as 
apolipoprotein  B  mRNA  editing  enzyme  and  catalytic 
polypeptide-like 2, is associated with ECNPs. This editing 
gene could be affected by genetic diversity and admixtures in 
Pan-Asian  populations.  In  this  ethnically  specific  genetic 
variation study, we found the features of gene sets having 
ethnically specific variations. The AT-rich interactive domain 
1B  (SWI1-like) (ARID1B) gene encodes  an AT-rich DNA 
interaction  domain-containing  protein.  This  protein  is  a 
component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex 
and may play a role in cell-cycle activation. It is associated 
with chromatin- mediated maintenance of transcription and 
nervous  system  development.  This  gene  is  related  to 
autosomal dominant mental retardation type 12. Discoidin 
domain  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  2  (DDR2)  is  associated 
with  colorectal  neoplasm,  metastatic  colorectal  cancer, 
hepatocellular  carcinoma,  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumor,

and  so  on.  These  ethnically  specific  genetic  variations 
represent relationships with cell cycling, metabolism, and 
the  developmental  and  immune  systems.  These  genetic 
variations can be affected by admixture and evolution. These 
ethnically specific variants may be forced to adapt in order to 
survive in new environments and play a significant role in 
development  and  functional  systems  associated  with 
diseases [20].

Conclusion

Our analysis was able to identify ethnically variable SNPs 
associated  with  phenotypic  changes.  We  selected  9,306 
ESNPs and 5,167 ECNPs in 72 Pan-Asian populations. We 
found that representative ethnic groups with specific ESNPs 
are recently branched-out subpopulations, whereas repre-
sentative ethnic groups with ethnic specific CNPs are early 
fixed  subpopulations,  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Fig.  6. 
This  likely  occurred  due  to  accelerated  and  accumulated 
genetic drifts or selective pressure. This shows that ESNPs 
may participate in the ongoing creation of genetic variation 
through selective pressure or selective sweep. These eth-
nically  specific  variations  are  associated  with  156  ESNP- 
related genes and 52 ECNP-related genes. Ethnically specific 
genetic  variations  may  affect  phenotype  variation  and 
disease susceptibility. Although it is not enough information 
to compare ECNP distribution and ESNP distribution direc-

tly,  significant  gene  sets  having  ESNPs  or  ECNPs  can  be 
useful to study disease risk and drug susceptibility.
