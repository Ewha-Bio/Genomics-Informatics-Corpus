Abstract

The  haplotypes  of  a  200  kb  region  in  the  human  chro-
mosome  X  terminal  band  (q28)  were  analyzed  using  the 
International  HapMap  Project  PhaseII  data,  which  had 
been  collected  for  three  analysis  panels  (YRI,  CEU,  and 
CHB＋JPT).  When  multiple  linkage  disequilibrium  blocks 
were  encountered  for  a  panel,  the  neighboring  hap-
lotypes  that  had  crossover  rate  of  5%  or  more  in  the 
panel  were  combined  to  generate  'haploid'  configura-
tions.  This  resulted  in  8,  7,  and  5  'haploid'  config-
urations  for  the  panels  of  YRI,  CEU,  and  CHB＋JPT, 
respectively.  The  multiple  sequence  alignment  of  these 
'haploids'  was  used  for  the  calculation  of  allele-sharing 
distances  and 
the  subsequent  principal  coordinate 
analysis.  Two  'haploids'  in  CEU  and  CHB＋JPT  were 
hypothesized  as  'parental'  in  light  of  the  observations 
that  the  successive  recombinants  of  these  haploids  can 
model  two  other  haploids  in  CEU  and  CHB＋JPT,  and 
that  their  configurations  were  consistent  with  those  in 
YRI.  This  study  demonstrates  the  utility  of  haplotype 
phylogeny  in  understanding  population  evolution.

Introduction

Linkage  disequilibrium  (LD),  the  nonrandom  association 
of  alleles  at  different  loci,  is  the  result  of  evolutionary 
history  of  the  population  involving  mutations,  selection, 
recombination,  population  bottleneck  and  random  genet-
ic  drift  (Xiong  &  Jin,  2007).  A  haplotype  is  a  set  of 
co-occurring  polymorphic  alleles  on  the  same  chromo-
some.  As  haplotypes  partition  the  genome  into  blocks 
that  show  strong  LD,  while  the  blocks  are  separated  by 
weaker  association  or  recombination  hotspots.  The  hap-
lotype  block  model  has  particular  implications  in  the 
study  of  dense  markers  such  as  single  nucleotide  poly-
morphism  (SNP)  as  it  implies  that  a  smaller  number  of

markers  (tagging  SNPs)  are  necessary  to  uniquely  dis-
tinguish  different  haplotypes.
    The  International  HapMap  Project  aims  to  produce 
such  valuable  haplotype  information  of  the  human  ge-
nome  (The  International  HapMap  Consortium,  2003).  A 
total  of  270  samples,  90  samples  from  each  of  three 
major  ethnic  groups,  African,  Asian,  and  European,  were 
genotyped,  phased  and  release  to  the  public  freely 
(Thorisson  et al.,  2005).  Taking  advantage  of  such  rich 
and  yet  free  resource,  various  research  hypotheses  can 
be  tested.  As  an  example,  the  readily  downloadable 
haplotype  configurations  of  the  panels  can  be  compared 
and  phylogenetic  relationship  among  them  can  be  pur-
sued  to  glean  how  the  haplotypes  might  have  been 
evolved.  Phylogenetic  studies  based  on  haplotypes  are 
not  new;  genetic  association  studies  have  been  done 
with  haplotypes  inferred  from  restriction  endonuclease 
mapping  in  fruitfly  (Templeton  et al.,  1987).  Recently, 
haplotype  phylogeny  has  been  advocated  for  detecting 
disease  susceptibility  loci  (Bardel  et al.,  2005).  A  hap-
lotype  phylogenetic  tree  was  constructed  based  on  six 
tagging  SNPs  of  DTNBP1  (Mutsuddi  et  al.,  2006). 
Genealogical  relationships  among  haplotypes  in  a  chro-
mosome  2  8.4  kb  region  without  obligate  recombination 
events  were  demonstrated  using  the  CEU  samples  only 
(The  International  HapMap  Consortium,  2005).  If  other 
population  samples  such  as  YRI,  CHB,  and  JPT  had 
been  included,  the  haplotype  blocks  would  have  been 
fragmented  due  to  a  number  of  historical  recombination 
events  and  phylogenetic  studies  with  such  a  small  block 
would  have  not  been  informative. 
    In  this  study,  instead  of  conventional  tree-based  phy-
logeny,  principal  coordinate  analysis  (PCoA)  (Higgins, 
1992)  was  employed  using  the  haplotype  data  on  a  re-
gion  encompassing  multiple  blocks.  As  PCoA,  albeit  dis-
tance-based,  is  useful  to  grasp  the  major  trend  among 
the  sequences,  it  would  be  worth  to  try  how  PCoA  per-
forms  with  such  a  dataset.  As  an  illustrative  purpose,  a 
region  of  200  kb  in  chromosome  Xq28,  which  is  about 
1  Mb  away  from  the  pseudoautosomal  region  (PAR2)  at 
the  tip  of  X  chromosome  long  arm,  was  chosen  and  the 
haplotype  structures  of  three  ethnic  groups  that  showed 
apparent  recombination  events  were  compared.  This  re-
gion  of  the  human  genome  harbors  several  important 
disease  genes  such  as  glucose-6-phosphate  dehydroge-
nase  (G6PD),  cancer/testis  antigens  (CTAG1B,  CTAG2), 
and  Gab3  protein  (GAB3). 

Methods

Genotype  and  haplotype  data 

The  genotype  data  used  in  this  study  were  of  the 
Release  21/phaseII  of  the  International  HapMap  Project 
(The  International  HapMap  Consortium,  2005)  and  were 
downloaded  from  the  Project  web  site  (Thorisson et al., 
2005)  using  Haploview  4.1  (Barrett  et al.,  2005).  The 
HapMap  Project  intended  to  cover  all  three  major  ethnic 
groups  and  collected  DNA  samples  from  four  pop-
ulations:  90  each  from  30  trios  of  African  Yoruba  people 
(YRI)  and  30  trios  of  western  European  ancestry  in  the 
US  (CEU),  and  45  each  from  unrelated  Chinese  in 
Beijing  (CHB)  and  Japanese  in  Tokyo  (JPT)  (The  Interna-
tional  HapMap  Consortium,  2003).  As  the  genotypes  of 
Chinese  and  Japanese  were  very  similar  to  each  other, 
the  HapMap  Consortium  pooled  these  groups  as  a  sin-
gle  analysis  panel  (CHB＋JPT)  (The  International  HapMap 
Consortium,  2005).  Consequently,  genotype  and  phased 
haplotype  data  were  available  in  three  separate  analysis 
panels,  namely,  YRI,  CEU,  and  CHB＋JPT.  Upon  down-
loading  the  genotype  data  separately  for  each  analysis 
panel,  various  pairwise  LD  measures  were  calculated  for 
markers  having  minor  allele  frequency  of  5%  or  more. 
LD  blocks  were  defined  usinge  the  default  parameters 
settings  and  haplotypes  for  each  block  were  estimated 
by  the  EM  algorithm  implemented  in  Haploview  (Barrett 
et al.,  2005).  Included  in  the  Haploview  output  for  each 
haplotype  were  population  frequency  and  transition 
probability  (crossover  percentage)  to  the  haplotypes  in 
the  neighboring  blocks.  The 
International  HapMap 
Project  also  provides  phased  haploid  structures  for  each 
individual  in  the  analysis  panels.  They  were  downloaded 
from  the  ftp  site.

Generation  of  'haploids' 

Haplotypes  from  neighboring  blocks  were  connected  to 
generate  a  long  'haploid'  configuration.  All  possible 
combinations  having  crossover  rate  of  5%  or  more  were 
used  in  enumeration  of  the  putative  'haploid'  configura-
tions.  A  'haploid'  was  denoted  as  ceu.i.j.k,  indicating 
that  it  was  generated  by  combining  the  i, j,  and  k-th 
haplotype  from  the  first,  second,  and  third  block  of  the 
CEU  panel,  respectively.  Those  'haploids'  having  identi-
cal  configuration  were  grouped  together  and  one  of 
them  was  arbitrarily  chosen  to  represent  the  group.

Calculation  of  allele-sharing  distance  and  PCoA

Dissimilarity  between  a  pair  of  'haploids'  was  calculated 
as  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  different  alleles  over  the 

Haplotype  Phylogeny  of  Xq28    131

number  of  all  the  markers.  No  correction  for  multiple 
substitutions  was  made,  as  only  the  polymorphic  sites 
were  included  in  the  multiple  alignments.  The  resulting 
dissimilarity  matrix  was  then  used  to  lay  out  the  'ha-
ploids'  onto  a  multidimensional  space  using  a  classical 
multidimensional  scaling  routine  implemented  in  R  stat-
istical  system  (http://www.r-project.org).  The  first  two 
principal  coordinates  were  taken  and  plotted  for  visual 
inspection  of  the  relationship  between  'haploids'.

Inference  of  ancestral  alleles

The  alleles  of  chimpanzee,  orangutan,  and  macaque  or-
thologous  to  the  human  Xq28  region  were  downloaded 
using  the  Table  Browser  of  UCSC  Genome  Browser. 
The  human  ancestral  allele  was  inferred  parsimoniously, 
i.e.,  as  the  chimpanzee  allele  if  and  only  if  the  chimpan-
zee  allele  was  the  same  with  one  of  the  human 
bi-alleles.  If  the  chimpanzee  allele  was  missing,  the  or-
angutan  and  macaque  alleles  were  looked  up  in  turn.

Results

from 

(data  not  shown).  Haplotypes 

The  genotype  data  of  the  chromosome  Xq28  200kb  re-
gion  were  downloaded 
International  HapMap 
Project  web  site  (http://www.hapmap.org)  using  Haplo-
view  (Barrett et al.,  2005).  See  Table  1  for  the  summary 
information  of  the  markers.  For  each  analysis  panel,  LD 
blocks  and  recombination  hot  spots  were  identified  us-
ing  Haploview 
re-
constructed  by  Haploview  for  each  block  are  shown  in 
Fig.  1.  For  YRI  (Fig.  1A),  seven  haplotypes  having  fre-
quency  greater  than  1%  were  found  for  the  first  block, 
while  three  haplotypes  were  found  respectively  for  the 
other  two  short  blocks.  Similarly  for  CEU  (Fig.  1B)  and 
CHB＋JPT  (Fig.  1C)  panels,  haplotypes  were  recon-
structed  separately  for  three  blocks.  It  should  be  em-
phasized  that  for  YRI,  unlike  the  other  non-African  pan-
els,  about  the  first  half  of  the  SNPs  listed  in  Table  1  had 
high  recombination  rate  and  consequently  not  included 
in  the  haplotypes.  Also  shown  in  Fig.  1  are  the  con-
nections  between  neighboring  haplotypes.  Thick  and 
thin  lines  were  drawn  for  the  crossover  percentage 
greater  than  10%  and  1%,  respectively.  As  the  panels 
were  different  one  another  in  haplotype  boundaries,  it 
was  not  possible  to  directly  compare  the  haplotypes 
from  different  panels.  Instead  we  regenerated  the  'ha-
ploid'  sequences  that  covered  the  200  kb  region  by  re-
combining  the  neighboring  haplotypes  having  crossover 
rate  of  5%  or  more.  There  were  eight,  seven,  and  five 
such  'haploids'  for  YRI,  CEU,  and  CHB＋JPT,  respec-
tively. 
    In  order  to  find  the  phylogenetic  relationship  among

the  haplotypes  covering  the  same  genomic  region,  a 
multiple  sequence  alignment  of  these  'haploid'  se-
quences  has  been  created.  As  shown  in  Table  1,  a  total 
of  47  SNPs  had  been  used  at  least  once  in  the  hap-
lotype  reconstruction.  However,  some  of  them  were 
monomorphic  in  at  least  one  other  panel  and  removed 
from  the  multiple  alignment.  A  total  of  25  markers  had 
been  polymorphic  in  all  three  panels  and  used  in  the 
subsequent  analysis.  Consequently  some  redundancies 
were  noticed  among  the  'haploid'  sequences  as  shown 
in  Table  2.  There  were  four  and  five  non-redundant  'ha-

ploids'  for  YRI  and  non-YRI  panels,  respectively.  As  not-
ed  above,  a  large  portion  of  loci  had  high  recombination 
rate  in  YRI  panel  and  haplotypes  were  not  constructed 
in  that  portion  ('un-haplotyped').  For  the  YRI  individuals, 
the  phased  individual  genome-wide  haploid  structures 
constructed  by  the  International  HapMap  Project  were 
downloaded  and  grouped  according  to  the  'haploid' 
structures  that  were  generated  from  this  study.  The 
'un-haplotyped'  portion  was  then  filled  in  by  the  con-
sensus  among  the  grouped  haploid  structures,  while  the 
polymorphic  sites  were  left  with  'N'.  In  order  to  validate

the  presence  of  other  non-YRI  'haploids'  as  well,  they 
were  also  compared  with  the  phased  individual  haploid 
structures  constructed  by  the  International  HapMap 
Project.  Their  frequencies  observed  in  that  individual  da-
ta  were  shown  in  Table  2.  Although  the  frequencies  esti-
mated  from  the  multi-haplotype  crossover  rate  were 
qualitatively  similar  to  those  observed  values,  all  the 
'haploids'  constructed  in  this  study  had  the  observed 
frequency  higher  that  5%,  the  same  cutoff  used  for  the 
crossover  percentage.  In  fact,  all  the  individual  haploids 

with  frequency  higher  than  5%  were  represented  in  the 
non-redundant  'haploids'  constructed  in  this  study. 
    For  each  pair  of  the  non-redundant  'haploids',  the  al-
lele-sharing  distance  was  calculated  to  form  a  dissim-
ilarity  matrix.  PCoA  was  then  performed  to  lay  out  those 
nine  'haploids'  in  a  multidimensional  space,  while  pre-
serving  the  distance  relationship  as  much  as  possible. 
The  first  two  dimensions  were  plotted  (Fig.  2).  The  an-
cestral  and  YRI  'haploids'  were  separated  into  two 
groups  along  the  first  principal  coordinate  (PC1)  axis, 
showing  a  progressive  substitution  pattern  in  the  last  six 
loci  for  yri.3.0.0, yri.4.0.0, yri.0.0.0, and  ancestral  'ha-
ploid',  while yri.1.0.0 was  the  most  distinct  with  a  highly 
polymorphic  pattern.  Interestingly  there  were  nearby 
non-YRI  'haploids'  that  showed  congruent  patterns:  for 
example, c＋j.2.1.1  was  located  on  the  lower  PC1  side 
as yri.3.0.0,  while c＋j.0.0.0 was  on  the  higher  PC1  side 
as yri.0.0.0. Among  those  five  non-YRI  'haploids',  these 
two  were  the  most  distant,  sharing  just  two  alleles  out 
of  25,  while  the  other  three  were  intermediate.  In  fact, 
the  first  five  alleles  of c＋j.0.2.1 were  that  of c＋j.0.0.0, 
while  the  rest  were  that  of c＋j.0.2.1.  It  is  cautiously  hy-
pothesized  that  c＋j.0.2.1  might  have  been  a  recombi-
nant  of c＋j.2.1.1 and c＋j.0.0.0.  Even  more  interesting 
is  that  of  ceu.0.1.3,  which  showed  the  pattern  of  c＋
j.0.2.1 in  the  first  19  loci,  while  the  last  six  were  that  of 
c＋j.0.0.0.  It  implies  that  another  round  of  recombination 
between  and c＋j.0.0.0 might  have  produced ceu.0.1.3. 
This  is  the  most  parsimonious  phylogenetic  model 
among  these  non-YRI  'haploids'.  Taken  together,  it  can 
be  hypothesized  that  c＋j.2.1.1  and  might  have  been 
the  'parental'  haploids,  while  the  putative  ancestral  'ha-
ploid'  had  a  structure  interlaced  with  both  'parental' 
haploids,  implying  they  might  have  been  diverged  from 
the  ancestral  'haploid'.  The  haploid  c＋j.3.0.0 had  the 
first  four  loci  that  were  different  from c＋j.0.0.0  and  yet

Discussion

    This  study  demonstrated  the  usefulness  of  haplotype 
phylogeny  in  reconstructing  evolutionary  history  of  the 
haplotypes.  When  applied  to  various  ethnic  groups  or 
populations,  it  has  the  potential  to  suggest  putative  mi-
gration  pathways.  Although  similar  study  can  be  per-
formed  with  the  genotype  or  'haploid'  configuration  of 
the  individuals,  such  strategies  typically  rely  on  some 
sort  of  genetic  distance  measure  and  the  detailed  con-
figuration  would  be  hidden  by  the  distances.  Conse-
quently  if  a  'haploid'  is  found  in-between  two  others,  it 
cannot  be  definitely  inferred  whether  it  is  a  mixture  of 
the  latter  or  not.  Character-based  phylogenetic  methods 
might  be  suitable  in  resolving  these  issues.  However, 
these  methods  assume  independent  variation  of  the  al-
leles  and  cannot  incorporate  the  evolutionary  concepts 

of  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  and  nonrandom  recombi-
nation.  The  method  presented  here,  haplotype  phylog-
eny,  takes  advantage  of  the  simplification  presented  by 
LD  and  haplotypes.  For  cases  with  historical  recombina-
tion  events,  the  conventional  tree-based  methods  such 
as  UPGMA  or  neighbor-joining  (Saitou  &  Nei,  1987)  may 
not  be  appropriate,  while  PCoA  still  works  by  showing 
the  major  trends  in  sequences  (Higgins,  1992).
    The  analysis  of  an  admixture  population  in  genomic 
scale  may  be  best  handled  by  a  model-based  clustering 
method  (Xu  et al.,  2008)  such  as  STRUCTURE  (Falush 
et al.,  2003).  However,  it  is  for  testing  model  hypothesis 
and  not  for  the  discovery  of  admixture.  It  also  requires 
lengthy  computational  time.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
method  presented  here  is  appropriate  for  locating  the 
potential  loci  of  crossover  events  at  the  fine  scale  utiliz-
ing  all  the  common  markers.  The  results,  then,  may  be 
tested  with  STRUCTURE.
    However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  work  presented 
here  has  some  limitations.  For  example,  the  spacing  be-
tween  neighboring  SNPs  were  rather  coarse  (∼10  kb)

The  two  putative  ‘parental’  haploids  in  CEU  and  CHB＋
JPT,  c＋j.2.1.1 and  c＋j.0.0.0 had  alleles  congruent  to  the 
two  most  distant  haplotypes  yri.3.0.0 and  yri.1.1.0, respec-
tively.  The  haploid c＋j.0.2.1 might  be  a  recombinant  of  the 
two  putative  'parental'  haploids,  while  another  round  of  re-
combination  between  c＋j.0.2.1 and  c＋j.0.0.0 might  have

lution  data  coupled  with  more  samples  become  avail-
