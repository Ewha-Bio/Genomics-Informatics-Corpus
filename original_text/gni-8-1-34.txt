Abstract

Radiofrequency  (RF)  radiation  might  induce  the  tran-
scription  of  a  certain  set  of  genes  as  other  physical 
stresses  like  ionizing  radiation  and  UV.  To  observe  tran-
scriptional  changes  upon  RF  radiation,  we  exposed 
WI-38,  human  lung  fibroblast  cell  to  1763  MHz  of  mo-
bile  phone  RF  radiation  at  60  W/kg  of  specific  absorp-
tion  rate  (SAR)  for  24h  with  or  without  heat  control. 
There  were  no  significant  changes  in  cell  numbers  and 
morphology  after  exposure  to  RF  radiation.  Using  quan-
titative  RT-PCR,  we  checked  the  expression  of  three 
heat  shock  protein 
(HSPA1A,  HSPA6  and 
HSP105)  and  seven  stress-related  genes  (TNFRSF11B, 
FGF2,  TGFB2,  ITGA2,  BRIP1,  EXO1,  and  MCM10)  in  RF 
only  and  RF/HS  groups  of  RF-exposed  cells.  The  ex-
pressions  of  three  heat  shock  proteins  and  seven 
stress-related  genes  were  selectively  changed  only  in 
RF/HS  groups.  Based  on  the  expression  of  ten  genes, 
we  could  classify  thermal  and  non-thermal  effect  of 
RF-exposure,  which  genes  can  be  used  as  biomarkers 
for  RF  radiation  exposure.

Introduction

Non-ionizing  radiofrequency  (RF)  radiation  refers  to  the 
electromagnetic  waves  ranging  between  10  MHz  and 
300  GHz.  It  is  constantly  produced  by  many  electronic 
devices  sources  such  as  mobile  phones,  base  stations, 
television  and  computer.  We  are  surrounded  by  these 
electronic  devices  in  daily  living  and  working  environ-
ments.  Because  the  usage  of  radiofrequency  radiation  is 
persistently  increasing,  we  need  to  understand  its  bio-
logical  effect  at  cellular  and  molecular  levels  in  detail.

  HSPs  have  been  well  known  as  a  marker  of  impending 
cell  damage  and  indicator  of  cellular  stress  such  as  heat 
shock  as  well  as  RF  radiation  (Tian et al.,  2002;  Yu et 
al.,  2007).  When  biological  samples  is  exposed  to  RF 
radiation  at  a  low  SAR  (＜1  W/kg)  or  for  short  duration, 
the  temperature  remains  constant  within  a  normal  phys-
iological  range.  In  contrast,  if  we  apply  higher  SAR  (＞
10  W/kg)  and/or  prolonged  RF  exposure,  the  temper-
ature  of  exposure  system  is  increased  even  in  the  pres-
ence  of  cooling  system.  In  this  sense,  the  expression  of 
HSP70  increased  time-  and  dose-dependently  at  above 
50  W/kg  SAR  of  2,450  MHz  for  1∼3  h  in  glioblastoma 
cells  (Wang  et al.,  2006).  However,  the  expression  of 
heat  shock  proteins  may  change  upon  non-specific 
stimuli.
    Recent  studies  have  focused  on  effect  of  non-thermal 
RF  radiation  in  biological  systems  (Chauhan et al.,  2007; 
Huang et al.,  2008;  Lee et al.,  2006;  Luukkonen et al., 
2009;  Qutob  et  al.,  2006;  Sanchez  et  al.,  2007; 
Takashima  et al.,  2006;  Verschaeve,  2009).  Most  of 
these  studies  have  shown  no  significant  effect  on  cel-
lular  and  molecular  levels  in  a  variety  of  condition. 
Microarray  analysis  of  gene  expression  showed  that 
there  is  no  evidence  that  non-thermal  RF  radiation  affect 
gene  expression  in  U87MG  glioblastoma  cells  exposed 
to  1.9  GHz  RF  at  SARs  from  0.1  to  10  W/kg  for  4  h  and 
24h,  respectively  (Chauhan  et al.,  2007;  Qutob  et al., 
2006).  Takashima  et al.  (2006)  also  failed  to  find  any 
changes  in  cell  proliferation  with  continuous  exposure  at 
up  to  100  W/kg  except  at  SAR  of  200  W/kg  suggesting 
that  RF  radiation  at  200  W/kg  SAR  affected  the  cells  by 
combined  with  heating  medium.  Similarly,  Sanchez et al. 
reported  that  there  were  no  effects  of  1,800  MHz  RF  ra-
diation  at  2  W/kg  SAR  on  HSP  expression  and  apopto-
sis  in  human  skin  cells  compare  to  ultraviolet  (UV)  and 
heat  shock  (Sanchez et al.,  2007).  In  our  previous  stud-
ies,  neither  of  cell  cycle  changes  nor  DNA  damage  as 
was  detected  in  after  1,763  MHz  RF  exposure  at  an 
SAR  of  10  W/kg  SAR  in  Jurkat-T  cells  or  20  W/kg  in  au-
ditory  hair  cells  (Huang  et al.,  2008). 
    Although  most  of  the  studies  on  the  biological  effect 
of  RF  exposure  could  not  detect  any  molecular  changes, 
some 
reports  could  demonstrate  RF-specific  gene 
expression.  Exposure  of  2.45  GHz  high  frequency  elec-
tromagnetic  field  to  glioma  cells  at  SAR  levels  above  20 
W/kg  led  to  an  increased  level  of  HSP70,  even  when 
the  effect  of  raised  temperature  is  taken  into  account 
(Tian  et al.,  2002).  Lee  et al.  found  that  2.45  GHz  RF 

radiation  at  10  W/kg  of  SAR  for  2∼6  h  affected  ex-
pression  of  221  genes  including  apoptosis-related  genes 
and  the  cell  cycle  genes  in  human  HL60  cells  without 
significant  increase  of  HSP  expression  (Lee et al.,  2005). 
1,800  MHz  RF  radiation  at  2  W/kg  got  24  h  in  rat  neu-
ron  altered  expression  of  cytoskeleton  genes  such  as 
microtubule-associated  protein  2  (MAP2)  and  signal 
transduction-related  genes  as  well  as  immediate  early 
gene  (EGR1)  (Zhao  et al.,  2007).  Recently,  it  has  been 
shown  that  exposure  to  900  MHz  GSM-modulated  RF  at 
1  W/kg  SAR  for  up  to  72  h  alters  morphological  matura-
tion  of  neural  cells  through  cytoskeleton  regulating  fac-
tors  such  as  β-thymosin  (Del  et al.,  2009).  These  re-
ports  suggest  that  RF  exposure  might  alter  the  cytoske-
leton  and  activates  signal  transduction  pathways,  thus 
lead  to  the  abnormal  neural  growth.  Yu et al.  also  found 
that  RF  exposure  induce  HSP27  and  HSP70  as  well  as 
phosphorylation  of  ERK1/2  and  JNK1/2  in  human  lens 
epithelial  cells  (Yu  et al.,  2007). 
    In  this  study,  we  exposed  normal  human  fibroblast, 
WI-38  cells  to  1,763  MHz  RF  radiation  at  60  W/kg  SAR 
for  24h  and  evaluated  effects  of  RF  radiation  on  molec-
ular  level  by  quantitative  RT-PCR  for  three  HSP  genes 
and  seven  stress-related  genes,  which  were  selected 
from  gene  expression  analysis  using  microarray  on 
RF-exposed  cells.

Methods

Cell  culture 

Normal  human  lung  fibroblast,  WI-38  cells  were  pur-
chased  from  ATCC  and  grown  in  DMEM  (Wellgene, 
Korea)  supplemented  with  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal 
bovine  serum  (FBS),  100  mg/ml  streptomycin,  and  100 
U/ml  penicillin  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  at  37oC 
in  a  5%  CO2  incubator.  The  cells  with  passage  number 
from  18  to  21  were  used  for  this  study.  Morphological 
changes  in  cells  were  observed  under  phase  contrast

microscope  (magnification  40X)  and  cell  numbers  were 
checked  using  hemocytometer.

Radiofrequency  (RF)  radiation  exposure  system

The  condition  for  RF  exposure  was  described  in  the 
previous  study  (Lee  et al.,  2006).  Briefly,  a  real  Code 
Domain  Multiple  Access  (CDMA)  signal  at  1,762.5  MHz 
was  applied  for  RF  exposure.  The  exposure  system  was 
first  equilibrated  to  37oC  for  2  h  and  WI-38  cells  in  100 
mm  culture  dish  containing  18  ml  of  growth  medium 
were  exposed  at  SAR  values  of  60  W  per  kg  for  24  h. 
The  temperature  in  the  chamber  was  maintained  at 
37±0.2oC  by  circulating  water  within  the  cavity  for  “RF 
only”  samples  (n=4),  while  the  temperature  in  the  cham-
ber  was  not  controlled  for  “RF/HS”  samples  (n=4). 
Before  and  after  RF  radiation  exposure,  temperature  of 
each  sample  was  measured  (Fig.  1).  Cells  were  immedi-
ately  harvested,  counted  and  processed  for  further 
analysis.  Cells  were  also  divided  separately  and  cultured 
at  37oC  in  a  5%  CO2  incubator  as  a  control  (n=8).

of  RF  radiation  exposure.

Quantitative  RT-PCR

Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  cells  using  RNeasy  Mini 
Kit  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA,  USA)  according  to  the  manu-
facturer’s  protocol.  One  microgram  of  total  RNA  was 
converted  to  cDNA  using  Superscript  II  reverse  tran-
scriptase 
(Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  and  oli-
go-(dT)12-18  primers  (Invitrogen,  Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  ac-
cording  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  The  qRT-PCR 
was  performed  in  a  total  reaction  mixture  containing 
cDNA,  SYBR  Premix  Ex  Taq  (Takara  Bio  Inc.,  Shiga, 
Japan),  Rox  reference  dye,  and  primers  specific  for 
each  gene  (Table  1).  Samples  were  analyzed  with  the 
ABI  PRISM  7000  sequence  detection  system  (Applied 
BioSystems,  Foster  City,  CA).  All  PCRs  were  performed 
in  triplicate,  and  the  specificity  of  the  reaction  was  de-
termined  by  melting  curve  analysis  at  the  dissociation 
stage.  We  normalized  each  value  with  GAPDH  and  rep-
resented  relative  expression  to  control. 

Hierarchical  clustering

Hierarchical  clustering  analysis  was  performed  with  the 
standardized  expression  values  using  the  “Manhattan” 
distance  metric,  and  the  “Ward”  linkage  algorithm.  The 
expression  values  were  standardized  across  samples 
with  the  median  value  and  inter-quartile  range  (IQR)  of 
each  transcript.  Statistical  supports  for  the  clustering 
were  obtained  by  bootstrapping  (BP)  analysis  and  the 
approximately  unbiased  (AU)  test  using  the  “pvclust” 

package  of  R  statistical  software.  For  the  informative-
ness  of  genes,  we  used  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  as  pre-
viously  described  (Furey  et al.,  2000).

Statistical  analysis 

Each  value  measured  in  independent  experiments  was 
represented  as  the  mean±standard  deviation  (SD). 

Results  and  Discussion

To  understand  the  non-thermal  effect  of  RF  radiation, 
we  exposed  WI-38,  normal  human  lung  fibroblast  cells 
to  1,763  MHz  RF  at  a  SAR  of  60  W/kg  for  24  hours 
with  (RF  only)  or  without  (RF/HS)  operating  cooling  sys-
tem  and  checked  the  expression  of  genes  by  quantita-
tive  RT-PCR.  We  recorded  output  of  RF  exposure  sys-
tem,  and  also  measured  temperature  of  medium  for 
eight  samples  right  after  RF  exposure  (Fig.  1).  Even 
though  there  are  some  variations  in  SAR,  RF  radiation 
was  almost  constantly  maintained  for  24  hours.  We  had 
four  samples  for  RF  only  group  with  controlling  temper-
atures  at  37oC  during  RF  exposure  and  the  other  four 
samples  for  RF/HS  group  were  exposed  to  RF  radiation 
and  heat  at  40∼42oC.  Among  these  two  groups,  we 
could  not  find  any  significant  changes  in  morphology 
and  number  of  cells  in  comparison  to  unexposed  control 
cells  (Fig.  2A).  On  the  other  hand,  24  hr-heat  shock  ex-
posure  resulted  in  the  decrease  of  cell  numbers  to 
50-70%  (Fig.  2B).  Long  term  heat  shock  exposure  might

induce  cell  death,  while  RF  radiation  with  heat  shock  for 
the  same  duration  in  RF/HS  group  did  not  induce  cell 
death.
    HSPs  have  been  widely  used  as  a  marker  of  impend-
ing  cell  damage  and  indicator  of  cellular  stress  such  as 
heat  shock  as  well  as  RF  radiation  (Tian  et al.,  2002). 
We  measured  the  level  of  mRNAs  for  HSPA6,  HSP1A1 
and  HSP105  using  quantitative  RT-PCR  in  two  groups. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  3A,  the  expression  levels  of  three 
HSPs  in  RF/HS  groups  and  heat  shock  control  group 

were  higher  than  RF  only  exposure  and  control  samples. 
Taken  together,  the  expression  of  HSPs  tested  in  this 
study  were  consistently  elevated  in  RF/HS  exposure 
samples,  but  not  in  RF  only  groups.  Even  the  exposure 
at  higher  SAR  (60  W/kg)  and  longer  duration  did  not  in-
duce  HSPs  as  it  did  at  a  lower  SAR  (10∼20  W/kg)  in 
previous  results  (Huang et al.,  2008).  We  tried  to  sepa-
rate  the  non-thermal  effect  of  RF  radiation  using  in-
tensive  temperature  control  system  to  observe  the  ex-
pressions  of  HSP.  Because  hot  spots  might  occur  within

lated  genes  (B)  and  down-regu-

cells  in  exposure  chamber,  RF  radiation  energy  might  be 
not  deposited  on  biological  sample  in  a  homogeneous 
manner  (McNamee et al.,  2009).  In  addition,  Tian et al. 
(2002)  suggested  that  high  frequency  electromagnetic 
field  exposure  can  induce  HSP70  expression  through  an 
unknown  mechanism  other  than  a  thermal  effect.  From 
our  results,  we  suggest  that  heat  shock  stimuli  (40  or 
42oC)  might  be  distinct  from  thermal  RF  radiation.  It  can 
be  intriguing  to  assess  whether  there  are  the  differences 
between  heat  shock  and  thermal  RF  radiation  in  respect 
to  molecular  and  cellular  levels.
    From  our  microarray  datasets  using  various  cell  lines 
on  stress  responses,  we  selected  seven  stress-related 
genes  which  significantly  were  up-regulated  (TNFRSF11B, 
FGF2,  TGFB2,  and  ITGA2)  or  down-regulated  (BRIP1, 
EXO1,  and  MCM10)  in  RF  radiation  exposure  compared 
to  unexposed  control.  We  checked  the  expressions  of 
seven  genes  in  RF  only,  RF/HS  and  control  samples  us-
ing  quantitative  RT-PCR  (Fig.  3).  Although  expression 
levels  of  genes  tested  in  this  study  highly  varied  among 
samples,  mRNA  levels  of  TNFRSF11B  (p＜0.05),  FGF2 
(p＜0.01)  and 
(p＜0.05)  were  significantly 
up-regulated  only  in  RF/HS  groups.  The  expression  lev-
els  of  BRIP1  (p＜0.05),  EXO1  (p＜0.01),  and  MCM10 
(p＜0.01)  were  significantly  down-regulated  only 
in 
RF/HS  samples.  None  of  seven  genes  were  changed  in 
RF  only  group  in  comparison  to  the  control  group.
    From  the  expression  profiling  data  of  ten  genes,  we 
tried  to  check  whether  eight  RF  exposure  samples  could 
be  classified.  Using  the  normalized  expression  values

from  quantitative  RT-PCR  for  tested  ten  genes,  we  ap-
plied  hierarchical  clustering  method  to  analyze  the  ex-
pression  patterns.  Statistical  supports  for  it  were  ob-
tained  by  bootstrapping  (BP)  analysis  and  the  approx-
imately  unbiased  (AU)  test.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4,  cluster 
dendrogram  with  AU/BP  values  (%)  indicated  that  four 
RF  radiation  samples  of  RF/HS  group  are  closely  clus-
tered  while  other  four  samples  of  RF  only  group  gathered 
to  one  cluster.  Among  ten  genes,  two  HSPs  (HSPA1A, 
HSP105),  two  up-regulated  genes  (TNFRSF11B,  TGFB2) 
and  two  down-regulated  genes  (EXO1,  MCM10)  are  in-
formative  to  understand  that  these  are  affected  by  RF

radiation  (Table  2). 
    Four  up-regulated  genes  are  related  to  the  cellular 
communication.  For  instance,  TNFRSF11B  (also  known 
as  osteoprotegerin,  OPG)  is  a  member  of  the  TNF-re-
ceptor  superfamily  and  reported  to  inhibit  osteoclast  for-
mation  and  function.  This  gene  is  specifically  stimulated 
by  TGFB  including  TGFB2  and  TGFB3  (Thirunavukkara-
su et al.,  2001).  Considering  that  both  TNFRSF11B  and 
TGFB2  were  up-regulated  by  RF  radiation,  effect  of  RF 
radiation  at  high  SAR  on  osteoclast  differentiation  may 
be  interesting.  Meanwhile,  down-regulated  four  genes 
are  related  to  DNA  metabolism.  For  instance,  EXO1  enc-
odes  a  protein  with  5'  to  3'  exonuclease  activity  as  well 
as  an  RNase  H  activity.  It  is  similar  to  the  Saccharo-
myces  cerevisiae  protein  Exo1  which  is  involved  in  mis-
match  repair  and  recombination  (Genschel et al.,  2002). 
BRIP1  (as  known  BACH1)  is  a  member  of  the  RecQ 
DEAH  helicase  family  and  directly  interacts  with  the 
C-terminal  BRCT  repeat  of  the  breast  cancer  suscepti-
bility  protein  BRCA1  (Kumaraswamy  et al.,  2007).  This 
report  suggests  that  BRIP1  is  critical  not  only  for  the 
timely  progression  through  the  S  phase  but  also  for 
maintaining  genomic  stability.  We  previously  could  not 
find  any  changes  of  cell  cycle  and  DNA  damage  after 
exposure  of  1763  MHz  at  10  or  20  W/kg  SAR  for  up  to 
48h  in  auditory  hair  cells  and  Jurkat-T  cells,  respectively 
(Huang  et  al.,  2008).  This  discrepancy  of  our  ob-
servations  may  result  from  difference  in  cell  type  and  RF 
radiation  dosage.  In  respect  with  cell  cycle,  further 
study  for  evaluation  of  these  genes  is  required  after  RF 
radiation  exposure  at  high  SARs.
    Many  studies  indicate  that  biological  effect  of  RF  ra-
diation  is  controversial  or  even  not  reproducible.  Some 
reasons  including  different  exposure  system,  thermal 
confounding  factor,  cell  type  and  experimental  variations 
can  be  hypothesized  for  these  different  observations  al-
though  it  still  remains  unclear.  Therefore,  we  could  not 
exclude  the  possibility  that  RF  exposure  affect  biological 

Expression  Profiling  of  Radiofrequency  Radiation    39

system  on  cellular  and  DNA  level.  Most  important,  there 
are  no  reliable  indicators  for  RF  radiation  on  molecular 
level.  We  applied  1,762.5  MHz  RF  radiation  at  60  W/kg 
of  SAR  to  normal  fibroblast,  WI-38  cells  for  24  h.  We 
failed  to  find  significant  changes  in  cellular  proliferation 
and  morphology  after  RF  radiation  exposure  compared 
to  heat  shock  treatment.  However,  analysis  of  quantita-
tive  RT-PCR  for  HSPs  showed  high  variations  in  ex-
pression  levels  among  RF  radiation  exposed  samples.  In 
addition,  RF  radiation  affected  expression  levels  of 
genes  including  TNFRSF11B,  EXO1,  and  MCM10.  Since 
it  has  been  unknown  about  relationship  between  above 
genes  and  RF  radiation,  they  may  be  potential  in-
dicators  to  differentiate  thermal  effect  and  non-thermal 
effect  during  RF  radiation.  It  will  be  interesting  to  exam-
ine  whether  expression  levels  of  these  genes  after  RF 
radiation  exposure  are  distinct  from  that  of  other  stres-
sors  such  as  UV,  ionizing  radiation  in  further  study.
