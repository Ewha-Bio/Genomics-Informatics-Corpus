Abstract

Domains  are  the  building  blocks  of  proteins.  Exon  shuf-
fling  is  an  important  mechanism  accounting  for  combi-
nation  of  a  limited  repertoire  of  protein  domains  in  the 
evolution  of  multicellular  species.  A  relative  excess  of 
domains  encoded  by  symmetric  exons  in  metazoan 
phyla  has  been  presented  as  evidence  of  exon  shuffling, 
and  symmetric  domains  can  be  divided  into  old  and 
new  domains  by  determining  the  ages  of  the  domains. 
In  this  report,  we  compare  the  spread,  versatility,  and 
subcellular  localization  of  old  and  new  domains  by  ana-
lyzing  eight  metazoan  genomes  and  their  respective  an-
notated  proteomes.  We  found  that  new  domains  have 
been  expanding  as  multicellular  organisms  evolved,  and 
this  expansion  was  principally  because  of  increases  in 
class  1-1  domains  amongst  several  classes  of  domain 
families.  We  also  found  that  younger  domains  have 
been  expanding  in  membranes  and  secreted  proteins 
along  with  multi-cellular  organism  evolution.  In  contrast, 
old  domains  are  located  mainly  in  nuclear  and  cytoplas-
mic  proteins.  We  conclude  that  the  increasing  mobility 
and  versatility  of  new  domains,  in  contrast  to  old  do-
mains,  plays  a  significant  role  in  metazoan  evolution,  fa-
cilitating  the  creation  of  secreted  and  transmembrane 
multidomain  proteins  unique  to  metazoa.

Introduction

Domains  are  the  building  blocks  of  proteins.  Domains 
functions  of  multi-domain  proteins  contribute  to  our  un-
derstanding  of  the  proteins  (Lee  &  Lee,  2008).  Domains 
can  occur  as  single-domain  proteins  or  in  combinations 
to  form  multi-domain  proteins  (Han,  et al.,  2007).  The 
analyses  of  complete  genome  sequences  have  revealed

that  multi-domain  proteins  have  increased  in  number 
during  evolution;  two-thirds  of  prokaryote  proteins  con-
tain  more  than  two  domains,  whereas  in  eukaryotes 
about  four-fifths  of  proteins  are  multi-domain  (Chothia, 
et al.,  2003).  These  data  indicate  that  eukaryote  proteins 
are  developing  more  complex  domain  architectures  and 
properties,  formed  by  domain  duplication  and  combina-
tions  of  a  limited  repertoire  of  domain  types  (Ye  & 
Godzik,  2004). 
    The  eukaryote  exon-intron  structure  suggests  that  do-
main  accretion  can  be  accomplished  by  the  acquisition 
of  exons  encoding  one  or  two  domains  (Liu,  et al., 
2005).  In  other  words,  protein  domains  tend  to  be  en-
coded  by  one  exon,  or  small  combination  of  exons,  that 
begin  and  end  in  the  splice  frame.  The  duplication  and 
rearrangement  of  such  exons  can  create  novel  genes 
with  revised  functional  properties.  This  domain  reuse 
has  been  described  as  the  exon  shuffling  theory  (Patthy, 
1999),  mediated  by  intronic  recombination  of  exons  en-
coding  protein  domains  (Eickbush,  1999)  and  by  the  ac-
tion  of  retrotransposons  (Moran,  et al.,  1999).  Proteins 
that  are  composed  of  a  number  of  discrete  domains  are 
termed  mosaic  proteins,  and  are  particularly  abundant  in 
metazoan  phyla  (Kolkman  and  Stemmer,  2001).
    Exon  shuffling  suggests  that  the  two  flanking  introns 
of  a  domain-encoding  exon  should  have  symmetric 
phase  combinations  (Patthy,  1999).  Intron  phases  are 
determined  by  the  examination  of  the  translational  read-
ing  frame  relative  to  the  intron,  and  introns  are  thus  de-
scribed  as  phase  0,  1,  or  2  introns.  Of  the  nine  possible 
combinations  of  flanking  introns,  three  are  symmetric 
(0-0,  1-1,  and  2-2)  and  six  are  asymmetric.  The  length 
of  a  symmetric  exon  is  always  a  multiple  of  three 
nucleotides.  Only  symmetric  exons  can  be  duplicated  in 
tandem  or  deleted  without  affecting  the  reading  frame, 
whereas  the  duplication  and  deletion  of  asymmetric 
exons  can  disrupt 
frame 
(Patthy,  1996).  Comparisons  between  human  exon- 
boundary  domains  and  bacterial  domains  have  indicated 
that  1-1  domains  are  associated  with  the  origin  of  ani-
mal  multicellularity,  whereas  0-0  domains  are  shared  be-
tween  eukaryotes  and  prokaryotes  (Kaessmann,  et al., 
2002).  This  comparison  also  indicates  that  0-0  domains 
date  back 
the  prokaryote/eukaryote  di-
vergence  and  can  thus  be  defined  as  ‘old  domains’, 
whereas  1-1  domains  were  created  recently  and  can 
thus  be  termed  ‘young  domains’. 
    In  this  study,  we  analyzed  eight  metazoan  genomes

corresponding  to  Pfam  domains,  and  the  positions  of 
exon  boundaries.  We  defined  the  “domain-exon  border 
box”  to  determine  relationships  between  domain  boun-
daries  and  exon  boundaries.  To  be  classified  as  an 
exon-boundary  domain,  exon  borders  were  required  to 

be  located  inside  the  border  boxes  [−10,  ＋10]  at  both 

ends  of  a  domain  (Fig.  1).  In  forming  correlations  be-
tween  a  domain  and  the  number  of  encoding  exons, 
there  are  three  possible  relationships:  one  domain  one 
exon,  one  domain  many  exons,  and  many  domains  one 
exon.  In  this  study,  we  focused  on  the  first  two 
relationships. 

Sub-cellular  localizations  of  old  and  young  do-
mains

Sub-cellular  localizations  of  human,  mouse,  and  rat  pro-
teins  were  extracted  from  the  “subcellular  location” 
comments  in  the  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot  database  (Wu, 
et al.,  2006).  Only  the  exact  and  complete  matches  to 
one  of  the  following  phrases  were  included:  “Nucleus”, 
“Cytoplasm”,  “Secreted”,  “Type  I  membrane  protein”, 
or  “Type  II  membrane  protein”.  We  excluded  proteins 
with  multiple  matches  and  multi-pass  membrane 
proteins.  For  membrane  proteins,  protein  sequences 
were  divided  into  cytoplasmic,  transmembrane,  and  ex-
tracellular  segments. 

Results

Identifying  the  reuse  of  old  and  young  domains 
during  metazoan  evolution

We  extracted  exon-boundary  domains  of  the  eight 
aforementioned  organisms  from  Ensembl  and  Pfam  re-
sults  if  both  ends  of  the  domains  encoding  exon(s)  were 
located  within  a  “domain-exon  border  box”.  Then, 
exon-boundary  domains  of  each  organism  were  divided 
into  nine  classes  according  to  the  combinations  of  their 
surrounding  intron  phases.  We  defined  a  protein  domain 
flanked  by  phase  1-1  introns  as  a  class  1-1  domain  and 
a  protein  domain  flanked  by  phase  0-0  introns  as  a 
class  0-0  domain.  The  numbers  of  the  exon-boundary 
and  the  class  of  domains  are  given  in  Table  1.  To  ex-
amine  which  class  domains  were  expanded  during  met-
azoan  evolution,  we  calculated  the  relative  frequency  of 
the  nine  classes  of  each  species  and  compared  these 
figures.  Each  relative  frequency  was  obtained  by  divid-
ing  the  number  of  domains  of  each  class  by  the  total 
number  of  exon-boundary  domains.  The  relative  fre-
quency  of  each  class  in  the  eight  organisms  is  shown 
in  Fig.  2,  which  makes  clear  that  the  relative  frequency 
of  class  0-0  domains  is  higher  than  that  of  class  1-1

ferences  in  the  spread,  versatility,  and  sub-cellular  local-
ization  of  old  and  young  domains  during  metazoan 
evolution.

Methods

Data  preparation

We  downloaded  gene  structures  and  protein  sequences 
of  primates  (human  and  chimpanzee),  rodents  (mouse 
and  rat),  dog,  fish  (zebrafish  and  tetraodon),  and  worm 
(Caenorhabditis elegans)  from  the  Ensembl  (Hubbard, et 
al.,  2007)  database  (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release45/). 
The  gene  data  included  genomic  exon  positions,  intron 
phase  information,  and  gene  descriptions.  Exon  phases 
were  obtained  by  the  analysis  of  the  two  flanking 
introns.  If  several  transcripts  for  any  particular  gene  had 
been  described,  we  selected  the  longest  coding  struc-
ture  for  analysis,  to  retain  the  maximum  number  of 
domains.
    The  domain  content  of  protein  sequences  was  ana-
lyzed  with  Pfam  23  (Finn, et al.,  2006).  In  this  work,  we 
used  Pfam  domains  rather  than  structurally  defined 
SCOP  (Andreeva,  et al.,  2004)  domains,  because  Pfam 
domains  offer  better  coverage  of  genomes,  especially 
for  membrane  proteins.  The  positions  in  proteins  of  do-
main  hits,  with  the  cutoff  E-value  of  0.01,  were  ob-
tained,  and  the  positions  in  amino  acid  coordinates 
were  converted  to  positions  in  cDNA  sequences.  We  in-
cluded  only  genes  with  more  than  one  Pfam  domains 
for  further  analysis.

domains  in C. elegans,  tetraodon,  and  zebrafish,  where-
as  the  relative  frequency  of  class  1-1  domains  is  higher 
than  that  of  class  0-0  domains  in  mouse,  chimpanzee, 
and  human.  All  the  remaining  classes  showed  relatively 
similar  frequencies.  Because  class  0-0  domains  are  re-
lated  to  old  domains  and  class  1-1  domains  are  asso-
ciated  with  modern  domains,  as  described  above,  these 
results  indicated  that  the  young  domains  became  widely 
spread  during  metazoan  evolution  whereas  old  domains 
became  under-represented  during  this  process. 

Comparing  the  versatility  of  old  and  young  do-
mains

In  multi-domain  proteins,  most  protein  domains  have 
few  partner  domains  and  appear  in  a  highly  conserved 
order  (Vogel,  et al.,  2004).  Certain  domains  appear, 
however,  in  many  unrelated  domain  architectures.  That 
is,  they  are  mobile  and  promiscuous  domains,  charac-
terized  by  their  ability  to  fold  independently.  This  feature 
prevents  misfolding  when  such  a  domain  is  inserted  into 
a  new  protein  and  these  domains  are  typically  short  and 
show  high  versatility  (Han,  et al.,  2007)  . 
    We  examined  partner  domains  of  class  0-0  and  class 
1-1  domains  to  identify  which  might  be  more  versatile. 
To  do  this,  we  extracted  N-terminal  and  C-terminal  part-
ner  domains  from  class  0-0  and  1-1  domain  of  the  eight 
organisms,  and  then  obtained  distinct  partner  domains 
of  the  two  classes  of  each  domain.  The  average  number 
of  distinct  partner  domains  in  the  two  classes  of  each 
domain  was  calculated  by  dividing  the  number  of  dis-

gans,  tetraodon,  and  zebrafish,  whereas  the  relative  fre-
quency  of  class  1-1  domains  is  higher  than  that  of  class 
0-0  domains  in  mouse,  chimpanzee,  and  human.  The  rela-
tive  frequency  of  these  two  domain  types  was  approx-

tinct  partner  domains  by  the  domain  frequency.  For  ex-
ample,  if  a  domain  D  appears  in  5  proteins  and  has  10 
distinct  partner  domains,  the  average  number  became 
2.0  (10/5).  This  analysis  shows  that  class  1-1  domains 
had  1.8  partner  domain  families  and  class  0-0  domains 
had  0.7  partner  domain  families,  on  average.  The  other 
class  domains  had  0.8-1.0  partner  domain  families.  This 
indicates  that  class  1-1  domains  are  the  most  versatile, 
and  class  0-0  domains  are  the  most  static.  Because 
class  1-1  domains  are  encoded  either  by  a  single  exon 
or  by  multiple  exons,  we  examined  partner  domains  of 
both  exon  types  to  identify  which  type  is  more  versatile. 
Domains  encoded  by  single  exons  had  2.3  partner  do-
main  families  and  domains  encoded  by  multiple  exons 
had  1.4  partner  domain  families.  This  indicated  that 
class  1-1  domains  encoded  by  single  exons  are  the 
most  versatile. 

Sub-cellular  localization  of  symmetric  domain 
families

To  identify  the  contributions  to  multicellularity  of  old  and 
young  domains,  we  investigated  whether  there  were  sig-
nificant  differences  in  the  number  of  old  and  young  do-
mains  in  the  proteins  in  different  sub-cellular  locations. 
To  do  this,  human  protein  localization  information  in  the 
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot  database  was  used. 
    From  this  database,  we  collected  a  total  of  5,339  hu-
man  genes  where  sub-cellular  locations  were  defined  as 
one  of  the  nucleus,  the  cytoplasm,  the  extracellular  en-
vironment  (secreted  proteins),  and  the  cell  membrane.

aThe  total  number  of  exon-boundary  domains.

The  sub-cellular  localizations  of  protein  domains  were 
determined  using  the  protein  sub-cellular  locations.  Of 
the  8,363  human  exon-boundary  domains,  the  sub-cel-
lular  localizations  of  3,562  were  identified.  From  these 
3,562  domains,  class  0-0  and  1-1  domains  were  se-
lected  for  study.  We  observed  that  the  average  diversity 
of  class  0-0  domains  and  class  1-1  domains  varied  be-
tween  different  sub-cellular  compartments  (Table  2).  For 
class  0-0  domains,  the  frequency  order  was  nucleus＞ 
cytoplasm＞secreted＞membrane (p-value＜9.8E-170). On 
the  other  hand,  the  frequency  order  of  class  1-1  do-
mains  was  membrane＞secreted＞nucleus＞cytoplasm 
(p-value＜3.7E-289).  The  domains  in  membrane  proteins 
were  further  divided  into  cytoplasmic,  transmembrane, 
and  extracellular  domains.  Interestingly,  most  exon- 
boundary  domains  in  membrane  proteins  were  located 
in  the  extracellular  region,  and  most  class  1-1  domains 
of  membrane  proteins  were  located  in  extracellular  re-
gions  with  a  small  number  of  domains  found  in  cyto-
plasmic  and  transmembrane  segments.  Class  1-1  do-
mains  accounted  for  most  exon-bordering  protein  do-
mains 
transmembrane  protein 
segments.
    In  conclusion,  the  analyses  of  sub-cellular  localization 
showed  that  class  1-1  domains  have  been  extensively 
reused  in  the  evolution  of  membrane  and  secreted  pro-
teins,  where  they  are  involved  in  cell-cell  signaling,  cel-
lular  adhesion,  and  cellular  migration,  all  of  which  are 
crucial  to  the  evolution  of  multicellularity.  In  contrast, 
most  class  0-0  domains  are  located  in  proteins  of  the 
nucleus  and  the  cytoplasm,  which  means  that  such  do-
mains  are  not  directly  related  to  the  evolution  of 
multicellularity.

in  extracellular  and 

Discussion

The  comparative  analyses  of  exon-boundary  domains 
from  human  and  other  eukaryotes  suggest  that  young 
(class  1-1)  domains  expanded  and  old  (class  0-0)  do-
mains  contracted  during  metazoan  evolution.  This  in-
dicates  that  young  domains  played  important  roles  in 
metazoan  evolution  and  the  contributions  of  old  do-
mains  to  multicellularity  were  relatively  small.  We  found 

that  the  expansion  of  young  domains  occurred  mainly 
because  of  expansion  of  class  1-1  domains  amongst 
the  several  classes  of  domain  families.  The  analysis  of 
the  versatility  of  the  old  and  young  domains  also 
showed  that  the  young  domains  are  the  most  versatile; 
with  a  versatility  index  twice  that  of  other  domain 
classes.  The  analysis  of  sub-cellular  localization  in-
dicated  that  modern  domains  are  mainly  located  in  the 
proteins  of  extracellular  regions  and  in  extracellular  seg-
ments  of  membrane  proteins,  consistent  with  previous 
studies  showing  that  proteins  in  extracellular  regions 
evolve  faster  than  those  of  intracellular  proteins  (Julenius 
&  Pedersen,  2006).  Most  old  domains  are  located  in  the 
nucleus  and  cytoplasm.  In  conclusion,  the  increasing 
mobility  of  young  domains  played  a  significant  role  in 
metazoan  evolution,  facilitating  the  creation  of  secreted 
and  transmembrane  multidomain  proteins  unique  to 
metazoa.  In  contrast,  old  domains  became  less  mobile 
as  multicellular  organisms  evolved.
