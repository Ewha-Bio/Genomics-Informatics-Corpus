Most common complex traits, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cancers, are known to be associated with multiple 
genes,  environmental  factors,  and  their  epistasis.  Recently,  the  development  of  advanced  genotyping  technologies  has 
allowed us to perform genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For detecting the effects of multiple genes on complex 
traits, many approaches have been proposed for GWASs. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is one of the powerful 
and efficient methods for detecting high-order gene-gene (GxG) interactions. However, the biological interpretation of GxG 
interactions identified by MDR analysis is not easy. In order to aid the interpretation of MDR results, we propose a network 
graph analysis to elucidate the meaning of identified GxG interactions. The proposed network graph analysis consists of 
three steps. The first step is for performing GxG interaction analysis using MDR analysis. The second step is to draw the 
network graph using the MDR result. The third step is to provide biological evidence of the identified GxG interaction using 
external biological databases. The proposed method was applied to Korean Association Resource (KARE) data, containing 
8838 individuals with 327,632 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, in order to perform GxG interaction analysis of body mass 
index (BMI). Our network graph analysis successfully showed that many identified GxG interactions have known biological 
evidence related to BMI. We expect that our network graph analysis will be helpful to interpret the biological meaning of GxG 
interactions.

Introduction

In recent years, a significant advance of technology has 
been  achieved  in  both  genotyping  and  computing  fields, 
which has enabled us to perform large-scale genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs) [1, 2]. GWASs have provided 
enormous  potential  in  identifying  genetic  variants  for 
common complex diseases. By GWASs, researchers have dis-
covered many genetic variants that affect common complex 
traits, such as height, type 2 diabetes, and blood pressure 
[3-5].

In particular, the nature of obesity is related with many 
chronic  diseases,  such  as  type  2  diabetes,  cardiovascular 
disease, and cancers [6-8]. In addition, it has been found that 
obesity  may  be  caused  by  multiple  genes,  environmental 
factors, and those interactions [9-11].

In order to identify the genes associated with obesity, body 
mass index (BMI) has been commonly used as an obesity- 
related  phenotype  or  trait  in  GWASs.  Many  studies  have 
reported that the genetic variants in FTO are associated with 
BMI [12, 13]. Most of these studies have used the single 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach, in which 
each single susceptible locus is searched in association with 
obesity.  The  single  SNP  approach  has  long  been  used  in 
detecting  genetic  traits,  and  it  is  especially  optimal  for 
Mendelian traits. However, complex traits are well known to 
be  caused  by  multiple  genetic  factors  as  well  as  several 
environmental  factors  and  their  interactions.  Thus,  the 
single SNP approach is not appropriate for detecting multi-
ple  genetic  factors  affecting  common  complex  polygenic 
traits.

associated with complex traits, the multifactor dimensio-
nality  reduction  (MDR)  method  has  been  proposed  by 
Ritchie et al. [14] and applied in detecting gene-gene (GxG) 
interactions [15, 16]. However, their approach can be app-
lied only to binary traits, and the covariates that may affect 
the phenotype can not be adjusted. In order to overcome 
these drawbacks, generalized MDR (GMDR) analysis was 
proposed  by  Lou  et  al.  [17],  in  which  both  binary  and 
quantitative  traits  can  be  considered  phenotypes  while 
adjusting for covariates.

Although  MDR  and  GMDR  have  been  widely  used  to 
detect GxG interactions in genetic association studies, their 
applications  have  been  mainly  involved  in  dealing  with 
candidate genes or a small set of genes. Since enormous com-
putational complexity and high-speed computing resources 
are required in GWASs, neither MDR nor GMDR has been 
successfully applied to GWASs. In order to overcome these 
computational  limitations,  we  previously  proposed  an 
efficient stepwise approach to identify GxG interactions for 
GWAS data [18] using cuGWAM, a graphic processing units 
(GPU)-based MDR program [19].

However, it still remains a challenge to have a biological 
interpretation of the identified GxG interactions. In order to 
elucidate the identified GxG interactions, we propose a net-
work graph analysis. Our network analysis method focuses 
not only on the biological meaning but also on the strength 
of interaction.

We applied our network graph approach to Korean Asso-
ciation Resource (KARE) data for GxG interactions and its 
interpretation. We first performed GMDR analysis for BMI. 
Using our network graph analysis, we then identified several 
GxG interactions having reasonable biological interpretation 
from the network graph using public biological resources.

Methods
The KARE data

The  KARE  project,  established  as  part  of  the  Korean 
Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES) in 2001, has started 
to undertake a large-scale genome-wide association analysis 
in Korean population-based cohort. These cohorts consist of 
10,038 participants in the urban Ansan (n = 5,020) and rural 
Ansung (n = 5,018) communities. The objective of the KARE 
project is to identify genetic factors of several clinical traits 
and lifestyle-related diseases by GWAS, based on population- 
based cohorts. In this analysis, we focused on BMI, one of 
more than 260 lifestyle-related traits.

DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of 
all  participants  and  were  genotyped  with  Affymetrix  Ge-
nome-Wide Human SNP array 5.0 (Affymetrix, Rockville, 
MD, USA). Genotypes were called using Bayesian Robust

Linear Modeling using the Mahalanobis distance (BRLMM) 
algorithm [20]. We performed a quality control process for 
the sample and genotype as previously described in Cho et al. 
[2]. In order to increase the coverage of common variants 
and  capture  additional  association  signals,  we  performed 
SNP  imputation  with  PLINK  using  the  Japanese/Chinese 
(JPT/CHB) component of HapMap as the reference. After 
sample  and  genotype  quality  controls,  327,872  SNPs  for 
8,842  individuals  were  available  in  the  KARE  data.  We 
applied  our  proposed  regularization  method  to  Korean 
genome-wide data. 

Network graph analysis

GMDR analysis step
GWAS datasets usually have enormous number of mar-
kers, which causes a severe computational burden. In order 
to  deal  with  this  computation  problem,  the  single  SNP 
association test with covariate adjustment is performed to all 
SNPs  in  a  dataset.  This  step  can  be  achieved  via  several 
toolkits  that  support  regression  analysis,  such  as  PLINK. 
Filtering by specific criteria, such as p-value, is subsequently 
performed in order to reduce the number of SNPs.

With the selected SNPs from the single SNP association 
analysis, exhaustive two-way GMDR analysis is then applied. 
However, general toolkits supporting GMDR analysis can 
only  handle  hundreds  of  SNPs.  Although  the  number  of 
SNPs in this step can be reduced by giving more stringent 
criteria,  it  may  ignore  the  SNPs  having  marginally  less 
significant  effects.  In  addition,  a  scheme  to  reduce  over-
fitting,  such  as  cross-validation,  requires  increased  linear 
computation  time.  In  order  to  solve  this  problem,  faster 
toolkits  are  recommended,  such  as  GPU-based  GMDR 
analysis toolkits like cuGWAM [19].

Since the number of combinations in GMDR analysis is 
usually very large, all results of GMDR can not be stored. 
Thus, a criterion is needed to store the specific interactions 
satisfying the criterion, such as balanced accuracy (BA).

Network graph construction
Network graph is often used to visualize multiple sets of 
interactions. It consists of nodes and edges connecting two 
nodes. For simplicity of representation, we focus on two-way 
interactions. Since the two-way interaction is for the relation-
ship between two variables, it can be easily represented as a 
graph that contains two nodes representing two variables of 
interaction and an edge corresponding to the interaction. 
According  to  this  scheme,  all  interactions  identified  by 
GMDR analysis can be visualized in the network graph. 

However,  this  scheme  can  cause  too  complex  a  graph 
structure when the number of interactions is large. Thus, it 
is  recommended  to  select  a  certain  number  of  possible

interactions in the network graph to reduce the complexity 
of the network graph. Alternatively, the complexity of the 
network graph can be reduced by gene mapping information. 
Since many SNPs are placed in a gene or adjacent to a gene, 
it is possible to annotate multiple SNPs into a single node of 
a gene according to their position. However, this approach 
requires a delicate mapping process.

In addition, the network graph can represent the strength 
of the interaction by the thickness of the edgeï¼that is, the 
higher the number of interactions between two nodes, the 
thicker the edge becomes. 

Network graph analysis
It  is  important  to  derive  a  reasonable  biological  inter-
pretation of identified GxG interactions. Here, we propose a 
network graph analysis step to aid the biological interpre-
tation of the identified GxG interaction by using existing 
biological resources. In other words, the goal of this step is 
to find known biological evidence that supports the iden-
tified GxG interactions. 

Resources used in this step consist of either a pair of a 
marker and target or two related markers, where a marker 
corresponds  to  a  gene  or  SNP  and  a  target  represents  a 
biologically  proven  target  related  with  a  marker.  From  a 
resource  with  marker  and  target  information,  such  as 
HuGENet [21], miRBase [22], and is-rSNP [23], we simply 
assume that there is biological evidence if two SNPs within 
an interaction share the same biological target defined in the 
biological  resource.  For  resources,  such  as  COXPRESdb 
[24], having information about the correlation among genes, 
we assume that all correlated genes in these resources have 
biological interactions. Although this is a naÃ¯ve assumption, 
the use of these resources is mainly to support the inter-
actions identified by GMDR analysis. Note that many known 
biological resources have their own unique data structures 
that differ from each other. Consequently, the integration of

Results

In  our  GMDR  analysis  using  KARE  data,  we  first  per-
formed the single SNP association test via PLINK (http:// 
pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) using a linear re-
gression model with covariate adjustment of age, area, and 
sex. We used the p-value from linear regression as a criterion 
of screening and used a p-value threshold of 3 Ã 10ï¼1 for the 
screening process; 101,837 SNPs were carried out after the 
screening process, as a result of the single SNP association 
test. The top 10 SNPs with the smallest p-values are listed in 
Table 1. The GMDR analysis was then performed using our 
GPU-based software, cuGWAM [19], in order to evaluate all 
possible  two-way  interactions  and  used  a  10-fold  cross- 
validation scheme, with covariate adjustment of age, area, 
and sex. An exhaustive search for two-way interactions from 
the selected SNPs took 19 h on the GPU system with three 
GTX285 graphic cards. In this step, a total of 51,853,363,660 
possible two-way interaction models were evaluated. 

In GMDR analysis, 10-fold cross-validation was used. For 
each cross-validation set, the top 10,000 interactions with 
the highest test BAs were selected, where BA is defined as 
the arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity [25]. We 
then calculated cross-validation consistency (CVC), which 
represents how many times the same two-way interaction is 
selected out of 10 cross-validation sets. Finally, we perfor-
med a screening step for every pair of interactions achieved 
from GMDR analysis that satisfied the two criteria, CVC â¥

Finally, we found 524 two-way interactions under these 
screening criteria. Among these interactions, 127 are from 
genes that are known to be associated with obesity and are 
summarized in Table 2. Among these interactions, five 
genesï¼FTO, CBARA1, CHUK, SLIT3, and NRXN3ï¼and 59 
SNPs have been reported in previous studies [15, 16, 26-29]. 
Visualization of these 524 two-way interactions into a net-
work  graph was  then  made  after  annotating  SNPs  to  the 
genes. We used Gephi (https://gephi.org) as a visualization 
tool. Gene annotation was performed according to the hg18 
human genome reference and dbSNP 129. These 524 two- 
way interactions are displayed in the network graph (Fig. 1). 
Each node represents either an SNP or gene. If a SNP is 
annotated to a known gene, then it is denoted by the gene 
name.  The  number  of  interactions  between  nodes  was 
represented as the thickness of the edge. For example, node 
FTO has a very thick edge with node NT5C2. Conversely, 
some nodes have a large number of nodes that are connected 
with it. We call these nodes hub nodes or hub SNPs. Hub 
nodes are represented by a gray background color.

these  genes  in  the  metabolism  pathway  is  related  to 
oxidative phosphorylation, which plays an important role of 
hepatic  mitochondrial  function  in  the  development  of 
obesity [31].

have weak main effects but have strong interactions with 
other SNPs. Table 3 shows the SNPs from hub genes that 
show significant two-way interactions with other SNPs but 
have weak marginal effects in the single SNP analysis.

For  the  network  graph  analysis,  four  public  databases 
(HuGENet [21], COXPRESdb [24], miRBase [22], and is- 
rSNP  [23])  were  collected  and  used  to  investigate  the 
biological  relationship  between  two  SNPs  with  an  inter-
action. A short summary of each database is given in Table 4. 
All databases used in this study were converted from the 
original bulk to a database table with automated script for 
the integrated investigation. The script for this conversion 
can be provided upon request. 

In order to improve the biological relevance of the inter-
pretation, we excluded all interactions having linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) between two SNPs. One of the results of 
the network graph analysis is given in Fig. 2. We identified at 
least one line of biological evidence among 26% of the 524 
GxG interactions.

In order to investigate the relationship between CVC and 
the rate of biological evidence, we performed an additional 
network analysis using 1,838 interactions (CVC â¥ 7) and 
found out that there was a strong relationship between CVC 
of the GMDR analysis and the presence of known biological 
evidence. As shown in Table 5, the proportion of interactions 
having  a  known  biological  interaction  was  significantly 
higher when CVC = 10 than when 7 â¤ CVC ï¼ 10 (39% vs. 
17% on average). In addition, from the network analysis of 
179 interactions having CVC = 10, 69 interactions showed 

biological  evidence  and  30  (43%  of  69)  shared  a  known 
relationship against BMI-related diseases, such as cardio-
vascular disease, body weight, hypertension.

Discussion

The main purpose of a GWAS is to detect genetic variants 
represented  by  a  single  SNP  or  a  set  of  SNPs  that  are 
associated with common complex polygenic traits of interest 
[2,  4,  5,  16,  17].  However,  it  is  commonly  known  that 
multiple  genetic  factors  as  well  as  several  environmental 
factors  and  their  interactions  are  involved  in  causing 
complex  diseases.  Thus,  the  single  SNP  approach  is  not 
appropriate for detecting multiple genetic factors for com-
mon complex polygenic traits. Recently, many researchers 
have  tried  GxG  interaction  analysis  in  GWASs.  However, 
they  focused  on  rather  restricted  regions  with  a  small 
number of SNPs due to computational complexity [32, 33].
In this paper, we have successfully performed two-way 
GxG  interaction  analysis  of  8,838  individuals  with  the 
selected 101,837 SNPs, which cover most genomic regions. 
It became possible with the help of a GPU-based system with 
three  GPU  graphic  cards.  It  took  only  19  h  to  perform 
51,853,363,660 possible two-way interaction analyses with 
10-fold cross-validation.

Our results showed that the FTO, CBARA1, CHUK, SLIT3, 
and NRXN3 genes are strongly associated with obesity. In 
addition,  our  approach  provided  more  information  about 
possible  GxG  interactions.  Note  that  some  SNPs  having 
weak main effects showed strong interactions with other 
SNPs (Table 3). It would have been very difficult to detect 
these  SNPs  through  single  SNP  analysis,  which  demon-
strates  the  usefulness  of  our  approach  in  detecting  GxG 
interactions.

In addition, our analysis provided some novel interactions 
that  have  not  been  reported  in  previous  studies.  For 
example, 9 SNPs from the FTO gene were found to have 
interactions with SNPs from CNNM2, AS3MT, and NT5C2. 
Similar  interactions  were  found  between LOC301738  and

PDZRN4, as shown in Fig. 1.

Our  network  graph  summarizes  two-way  interactions 
between SNPs very efficiently. We expect that this visuali-
zation tool could be helpful to researchers. It is also quite 
efficient to identify specific patterns and hub genes. 

Through our network graph analysis, we also identified 
several  pieces  of  evidence  that  supported  the  identified 
interactions with known biological information. From the 
investigation with four published databases, we found that 
39% of a total of 179 interactions with CVC = 10 are known 
to have biological interactions from the four databases we 
collected. In addition, our network graph analysis showed a 
higher  identification  rate  of  shared  biological  relevance 
when the CVC was large than when the CVC was low, which 
suggests that interactions having a high value of CVC tend to 
share  more  known  biological  evidence  that  are  actually 
related the phenotype. 

In summary, our network graph analysis from GxG inter-
action analysis successfully identified the relationship bet-
ween interactions from GMDR analysis and actual biological 
relevance. In addition, our strategy interpreted GxG inter-
actions very effectively in finding known biological evidence 
using multiple public databases, especially in finding evi-
dence that is actually related with the phenotype.
