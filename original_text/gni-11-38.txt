In cancer genome studies, the annotation of newly detected oncogene/tumor suppressor gene candidates is a challenging 
process. We propose using concept lattice analysis for the annotation and interpretation of genes having candidate somatic 
mutations  in  whole-exome  sequencing  in  acute  myeloid  leukemia  (AML).  We  selected  45  highly  mutated  genes  with 
whole-exome sequencing in 10 normal matched samples of the AML-M2 subtype. To evaluate these genes, we performed 
concept lattice analysis and annotated these genes with existing knowledge databases.

Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most well- 
studied diseases in the genomic research area [1, 2]. AML 
occurs usually in middle-aged people and is diagnosed by 
increasing leukemic myeloblasts in blood over 30% [3]. AML 
is  a  genetically  heterogeneous  disease,  since  1/3  of  AML 
patients have chromosomal rearrangements, like t(8;21) and 
t(15;17), but other AML patients have normal karyotypes 
[4].  With  recent  advances  of  high-throughput  genomic 
technology, a favorable prognosis has been observed with 
some genetic changes in cytogenetically normal AML [5]. 
These  results  were  reflected  by  the  World  Health 
Organization  (WHO)  diagnostic  criteria;  the  NMP1  and 
CEBPA  mutations  were  included  in  the  2008  revision  of 
these  criteria  [6].  The  molecular  change  of  AML  is  con-
sidered  to  be  the  accumulation  of  somatic  mutations  in 
hematopoietic progenitor cells [7]. Next-generation sequen-
cing technology gave us new insights into the clonal hete-
rogeneity of leukemic mutations so that we can make an 
explanation  why  some  of  these  mutations  are  highly  re-

producible  but  others  are  very  rare  [8].  Still,  in  30%  of 
cytogenetically normal AML, the genetic causality origin or 
strongly  associated  genetic  changes  have  not  yet  been 
discovered [9, 10]. 

With advances of high-throughput technology, discovery 
of  disease-associated  genes  is  growing  [11].  As  a  conse-
quence, the genetic knowledge databases are growing ra-
pidly. Accordingly, the annotation of candidate causal genes 
in genetic studies is a very challenging process for resear-
chers. We propose a workflow of the detection of somatic 
mutation candidates in 10 normal matched AML samples 
and  introduce  concept  lattice  analysis  for  clustering  the 
samples that have highly mutated genes in common.

Methods
Primacy sequence analysis

We received the fastq files of whole-exome sequencing 
results of tumor and matched normal sample data of 10 AML 
patients from the Korea Genome Organization in December 
2012.  There  were  no  patient-related  medical  or  charac-

teristic data. We aligned the sequencing reads to the human 
reference genome (hg 19, GRCh37) from USCC by BWA 
0.6.2 [12] (Figs. 1 and 2). To filter the known single nucle-
otide polymorphisms (SNPs), we used dbSNP bulid 137. We 
removed PCR duplicates and filtering low-quality SNPs by 
Samtools  0.1.18  [13],  Picard  1.68  [14],  and  GATK  2.3.4 
[15]. After the filtering process, the SAM file was converted 
to VCF file by VCF Tools 0.1.10 [16]. For detecting somatic 
mutation candidates, we obtained the difference in VCF files 
between tumor and normal samples. For annotation of these 
somatic mutation candidates, we used the ANNOVAR tool 
[17]. 

Formal concept analysis

We  used  formal  concept  analysis  (FCA)  for  the  con-
struction  of  hierarchical  relationships  among  samples 
sharing highly mutated genes [18]. FCA is a useful method 
in  conceptual  clustering  of  objects,  attributes,  and  their 
binary relationship. In FCA, the sets of formal objects and 
formal attributes together with their relation to each other 
form  a  “formal  context,”  which  can  be  represented  by  a 
crosstable. In our case, the objects are 10 AML samples, and 
the attributes are 45 highly mutated genes. We defined the 
formal context as K = (G, M, I), where G is a set of objects 
(i.e., samples), M is a set of attributes (i.e., mutated genes), 
and I ⊆ G × M is the incidence relations where (g, m) ⊆ I if 
object g has attribute m. For A ⊆ G and B ⊆ M, we define the 
operators A' = {m ∈ M|gIm for all g ∈ A} (i.e., the set of 
attributes common to the objects in A) and B' = {g ∈ G|gIm 
for  all  m  ∈ B}  (i.e.,  the  set  of  objects  common  to  the 
attributes in B). A pair of (A, B) is a formal concept of k(G, 
M, I) if and only if  A ⊆ G, B ⊆ M, A' = B, and A = B'. A is 
called the extent and B is the intent of the concept (A, B). The 
extent consists of all objects belonging to the concept while 
the intent contains all attributes shared by the objects. The 
concept  of  a  given  context  is  naturally  ordered  by  the 
subconcept-superconcept relation, defined by (A1, B1) ≤ 
(A2, B2): ＜=＞ A1 ⊆ A2 (＜=＞ B2 ⊆ B1).

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

The ordered set of all concepts of the context (G, M, I) is 
denoted by C(G, M, I) and is called the concept lattice of (G, 
M, I). We represent the structure of this concept lattice with 
a Hasse diagram, in which nodes are the concepts and the 
edges correspond to the neighborhood relationship among 
the concepts. All concepts above an object label (below the 
attribute  label)  include  that  object  (attribute).  The  top 
element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept 
that  contains  all  objects.  The  bottom  element  is  a  zero 
concept having no object.

Mutation analysis

The  most  frequently  mutated  genes  across  all  samples 
were USP9Y and MUC5B; these genes were mutated in 5 
samples.  These  genes  were  also  highly  mutated  in  each 
sample; for USP9Y genes, it had 6 nonsynonymous muta-
tions in sample 3. We have selected 45 highly mutated genes 
(1.5%) from 2981 mutated genes. We defined highly mu-
tated  genes  as  genes  having  3  or  more  nonsynonymous 
mutations  in  each  sample  (Table  3).  In  a  comparison  of 
mutations  with  the  COSMIC  database  [19],  among  45 
highly mutated genes, 21 genes matched to hematopoietic 
and  lymphoid  tissue  malignancy  terms,  and  21  genes 
matched  to  other  cancer  types.  In  3  genes,  there  was  no 
matched term in COSMIC (Table 4).

We used the concept lattice to construct the hierarchical 
relationship between the samples that had 45 highly 
mutated genes. Concept Biolattice analysis is a mathe-
matical framework based on concept lattice analysis for 
better biological interpretation of genomic data. The top 
element of a lattice is a unit concept, representing a concept 
that contains all objects. The bottom element is a zero 
concept having no object [20, 21]. For comparing with the 
Concept lattice (Fig. 5), we also performed hierarchical 
clustering analysis by Ward method. In hierarchical clus-
tering, cluster 1 has 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 9, and 10), 
cluster 2 has 2 samples (nos. 4 and 7), and others have 1 
sample each (Fig. 6). We divided the samples into 4 
subgroups by interpretation of the concept lattice result (Fig. 
7). Lattice subgroup 1 shared SYNE1 gene mutation, and 
samples 3, 4, and 7 were included in this subgroup. 
Subgroup 2 was comprised of 5 samples (nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, and 
9) that had MUC5 gene mutations in common. Samples 10 
and 8 could be isolated by the uniqueness of their mutated

point  mutations  include  7,483  synonymous  single  nucle-
otide variations (SNVs), 4,297 nonsynonymous SNVs, 282 
stopgain  SNVs,  14  stoploss  SNVs,  and  5  frameshift  sub-
stitutions, and the Indels include 247 frame shift insertions, 
310 frameshift deletions, and 68 nonframe shifts (Fig. 4). 
For  each  patient,  the  average  nonsynonymous  mutation 
count was 429.7 (SD, 97.16).

About 342 to 665 genes have nonsynonymous somatic 
mutation candidates at least once in each AML sample (Table 
2). Recurrent mutated genes were observed in all samples.

Discussion

In this study, we proposed a workflow of matched normal 
AML  exome  sequencing  analysis  and  the  framework  for 
defining  sample  subgroups.  We  observed  every  sample 
having a nonsynonymous mutation associated with hema-
tological and lymphoid malignancy genes, but the candidate

oncogenes showed diverse characters.

We selected 45 genes that had 3 or more nonsynonymous 
mutations and performed hierarchical clustering analysis of 
the samples by these genes. In classic hierarchical clustering 
analysis by Ward’s method, we could not identify the genetic 
relationship of those clusters. On the other hand, the result 
of concept lattice analysis gave us insight into the mutational 
pattern of each sample.

In subgroup 1, samples 3, 4, and 7 shared SYNE1 gene 
mutations.  SYNE1  gene  encodes  a  spectrin  repeat-con-
taining protein expressed in skeletal and smooth muscle and 
peripheral blood lymphocytes that localizes to the nuclear 
membrane [21]. This gene is not a well-known leukemic 
gene but is observed in some hematological malignancies

and other cancer types [22]. In glioblastoma, SYNE1 muta-
tion is significantly correlated with the overexpression of 
several known glioblastoma survival genes [23]. In the case 
of  sample  3,  the  ITGAX  gene,  encoding  ankyrin  repeat 
domain 18A, was mutated. This gene is well known by the 
association with leukemia [24] and lung cancer [25]. For 

sample 4, the possible oncogene is LAMC3. LAMC3 gene 
encodes  laminins,  which  are  the  major  non-collagenous 
constituent of basement membrane. LAMC3 mutations are 
associated with several cancers, including colon cancer, lung 
cancer,  and  melanoma,  and  candidate  tumor  suppressor 
genes in bladder transitional cell carcinoma [26]. LAMC3 is

involved in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt signaling 
pathway, since it has a role in cell adhesion. The ANKRD18A 
gene is the oncogene candidate for sample 7 and is a novel 
epigenetic regulation gene in lung cancer [25]. Therefore, it 
is  possible  that  the  pair  relationship  of  those  genes 

(ITGAX-SYNE1,  LAMC3-  SYNE1,  and  ANKRD18A-SYNE1) 
could  contribute  together  to  evolve  the  leukemic  cell 
transformation. 

The major limitation of our study is that we could not 
validate  the  mutation  results  by  Sanger  method  or  deep

sequencing.  We  selected  highly  mutated  genes  having  3 
mutations or more, but this definition is arbitrary, so we 
might have lost candidate oncogenes in some patients. 

In this study, we suggest the concept of clustering samples 
that have diverse mutated genes. AML is very heterogeneous 
genetic disease. Despite the small number of samples we 
have studied, the genetic variation patterns were not com-
mon for all samples. It could have been better to evaluate 
more sample data for analysis by clustering analysis.
