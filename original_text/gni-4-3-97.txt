Abstract 
Background: In acute leukemia patients, several successful 
methods of expression profiling have been used for various 
purposes,  i.e.,  to  identify new disease class,  to select a 
therapeutic  target,  or  to  predict  chemo-sensitivity  and 
clinical  outcome.  In  the  present  study,  we  tested  the 
peripheral blood of 4 7 acute leukemia patients in an attempt 
to identify differentially expressed genes in AML and ALL 
using a Korean-made 10K oligo-nucleotide microarray. 
Methcxls: Total RNA was prepared from peripheral blood 
and  amplified  for  microarray  experimentation.  SAM 
(significant analysis of microarray) and PAM (prediction 
analysis  of microarray)  were  used  to  select  significant 
genes.  The  selected  genes  were  tested  for  in  a  test 
group, independently of the training group. 
Results: We identified 345 differentially expressed genes 
that differentiated AML and ALL patients (FWER<0.05). 
Genes were selected using the training group (n=35) and 
tested for in the test group (n=12). Both training group and 
test group discriminated AML and ALL patients accurately. 
Genes that showed relatively high expression in AML patients 
were deoxynucleotidyl transferase, pre-S lymphocyte gene 3, 
B-cell  linker,  CD9  antigen,  lymphoid  enhancer-binding 
factor 1,  CD79B antigen, and early B-cell factor.  Genes 
highly  expressed  in  ALL  patients  were  annexin  A 1, 
amyloid  beta  (A4)  precursor protein,  amyloid  beta  (A4) 
precursor-like  protein  2,  cathepsin  C,  lysozyme  (renal 
amyloidosis),  myeloperoxidase,  and  hematopoietic 
prostaglandin D2 synthase. 
Conclusion: This study provided genome wide molecular 
signatures  of  Korean  acute  leukemia  patients,  which 
9learly identify AML and ALL.  Given with other reported 
signatures, these molecular signatures provide a means 
of  achieving  a  molecular  diagnosis  in  Korean  acute 
leukemia patents.

Introduction 
The exact diagnosis and classification of acute leukemias 
are of clinical  importance due to the different treatment 
approaches  required.  Acute  myelogenous  leukemia 
(AML) is a malignant disease of the bone marrow in which 
hematopoietic precursors are transformed and arrested 
in an earlier stage of development. AML is diagnosed on 
the presence of greater than  20% blasts in  the marrow 
(Jaffe eta/., 2001 ). Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is 
also a  malignant clonal  disease of the  bone  marrow in 
which early lymphoid precursors proliferate and replace 
the normal hematopoietic cells of the marrow. Although 
AML  and  ALL  are  distinct  clinical  and  morphological 
disease  entities,  no  single  test  is  currently  capable  of 
differentiating them.  The classification  proposed  by the 
French-American-British (FAB) is based on morphology 
and  cytochemistry,  and  involves  eight major subtypes, 
i.e.,  MO to M7 (Bennet eta/.,  1976; Bennet eta/., 1985). 
The new World Health Organization (WHO) classification 
incorporates molecular, cytogenetic,  and clinical features 
with  morphology  (Jaffe  et a/.,  2001 ),  and  provides  new 
prognostic  markers  and  suggests  disease-specific 
therapeutic approaches.  For example,  all-trans-retinoic 
acid and arsenic trioxide have revolutionized the treatment 
of acute promyelocytic leukemia characterized by t ( 15: 17) 
(q22:q21)  (Kelly  eta/.,  2001).  However,  the  standard 
diagnostic methods required for leukemia are complex, 
time-consuming,  and  require  experienced  specialists. 
Moreover, the diagnoses of some patients remain obscure 
based on current classifications.  In addition, therapeutic 
strategies  determined  on  the  basis  of classification  are 
unsatisfactory. For example, the most appropriate treatment 
for standard-risk AML,  which accounts for over half of all 
cases  of this  disease,  has  not  been  firmly  established. 
Moreover, this subgroup is difficult to classify,  because it 
includes  cases  with  various  numerical  and  structural 
cytogenetic abnormalities that occur infrequently,  which 
makes it difficult to determine their prognostic significances 
(Grimwade eta/., 2001 ).  Moreover, cytogenetic analysis 
provides no clues in cases of AML with a normal karyotype, 
which account for the majority of cases in the standard-risk 
group.

Gene expression profiles have recently been featured in 
research  programs concerning  hematologic malignancies. 
The diagnosis and  classification  of leukemia  have been 
mainly issued for several years. Golub eta/. successfully 
classified AML and ALL using molecular signatures (Golub 
eta/.,  1999), and the studies by Bullinger eta/. (Bullinger 
eta/., 2004)  and Valk eta/. (Valk eta/., 2004) suggested 
that molecular classifications based on  gene expression 
profiles  could  provide  more  accurate  diagnoses  and 
classifications  and  predict  clinical  outcomes  better. 
Bullinger et at. identified a new molecular subtype of AML 
that  includes  two  prognostically  relevant  subgroups  of 
AML with a normal karyotype. Valk et at. reported several 
novel  clusters,  some  consisting  of  specimens  with  a 
normal karyotype and a unique cluster in a patient with a 
poor  clinical  outcome.  Several  clusters  identified  by 
Schoch et at.  (Schoch et at., 2002) and Debernardi et at. 
(Debernardi  et at.,  2003)  were  found  to  correspond  to 
cytogenetic and molecular definitions, such as, t ( 15; 17), 
t  (8;21),  and  inv  (16).  These,  collectively,  reflect  that 
genome-wide expression profiles and can be integrated 
into  clinical  practice  to  broaden  our  understanding  of 
these diseases. 

Here, we report on an application of gene-expression 
profiling to the differentiation of AML and ALL.  As far as 
we are aware,  this is the first report of gene expression 
profiling  by  oligo-nucleotide  Microarray  analysis  in 
hematological malignancies in Korea. 

Materials and Methods 
Patients and Clinical data 
Patients  diagnosed  with  AML  or  ALL  with  available 
peripheral  blood  samples  available  for  analyses  were 
enrolled  in  this  study.  A  total  of  47  patients  were 
analyzedat the Seoul  National University Hospital,  lnha 
University  Hospital,  Gachon  University  Gil  Medical 
Center,  Hallym  University  Medical  Center,  and  at  the 
Korean Cancer Center Hospital (Table 1 ).

Preparation of total RNA 
Mononuclear cells  were  isolated  from  peripheral  blood 
bycentrifugation  on  a  Ficoll  Hypaque  (density,  1.077; 
APB,  Upsalla,  Sweden)  density  gradient.  Total  RNA 
from these cells was isolated using TRIZOL (Gibco BRL, 
NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reference 
RNA was obtained from the Jerket cell  line. 

Oligo-neucleotidenucleotide Microarray analysis 
Total  RNA  (5  11g)  was  converted  into double stranded 
eDNA using the eDNA synthesis system (Roche) using 
T7-(dT)24  primer.  The synthesized  eDNA was purified 
using RNeasy kits (Qiagen, Valencia, http://www.qiagen. 
com), and prepared cDNAs were labeled with Cy5-UTP (for 
reference  RNA)  or  Cy3-UTP(for  test  samples)  using 
Megascript T7 kits (Ambionm Austin). cRNAs were cleaned 
using RNeasy (Qiagen). Labeled 1511g·of each cRNA was 
mixed and fragmented by heating to 94 oc for 15 min, and 
hybridized  with  a  Human  10  K  microarray (Macrogen, 
Seoul, Korea) for 16h at 42°C. Arrays were then washed 
and scanned with an Array scanner (Molecular Dynamics). 
Acquired 
images  were  processed  and  analyzed 
statistically with  respected  to  spot  intensities  using  an 
lmagene v4.1  software (Biodiscovery,  CA,  USA). 

Statistical analysis 
Nonnalization and filtering 
To  normalize  microarray  data,  we  used  the  within  pin 
group,  intensity dependent Loess method.  An  'MA-plot' 
was  used  to  represent  the  R  and  G  data,  where 
M=log2RIG and A=log2 (RG)1/2; R represents the F635 
signal  from  Cy-5  and  G  the  F532  signal  from  Cy-3 
labeling.  To  correct  for  pin  variation,  within  pin  group 
normalization'was performed. Raw data was normalized 
relative  to  a  (pin  tip+A),  i.e.  log2RIG  log2RIG-ci(A)  = 
log2Rf[ki (A) G] where ci (A) is the Lowess fit to the MA-plot 
for the  i th  pin  group  only,  i=1 ,2, .. .I and  I denotes  the 
number of pin  groups. The normalized data was filtered 
using  the  criteria  of  missing  value  >20%  in  studied 
samples.  Remained  data  with  missing  values  were 
adjusted  using  the  K  nearest  neighborhood  joining 
method. 

Selection of differentially expressed genes 
We used 35 samples (28 AML and  7 ALL) as a training 
group and 12 samples (9 AML and 3 ALL) as a test group. 
To 
identify  differentially  expressed  genes,  which 
discriminate AML from ALL, namely classifier genes, we 
used SAM (Significant Analysis of Micorarray). Classifier 
genes  were  determined  using  FDR  (<0.05).  Selected 
classifier genes were validated by class prediction using

Gaussian linear discriminant analysis in the independent 
test group. CLUSTER and TREEVI EW were used for data 
clustering and visualization (Eisen eta/.,  1998). 

Results 
Identification of classifier genes that differentiate 
AMLandALL 
We selected 35 samples as a training group from the 47 
samples to reduce the effect of individual variability. After 
normalization  and  filtering  as  described  above,  we 
obtained  10,000  gene  expression  data,  which  were 
available for further analysis. Based on the unsupervised 
clustering  of whole  samples,  AML  and  ALL  were  not 

differentiable due to high  noise levels in  the expression 
data (Fig.  1 ). 

To remove noise signals and identify genes differentially 
expressed  in  AML  and  ALL,  supervised  analysis  was 
performed using Significant Analysis of Microarray (SAM). 
Genes were selected using a False Discovery Rate (FOR) of 
<0.05  as  threshold,  and  345  genes  were  found  to  be  at 
significantly  different  levels  in  AML  and  ALL  (Fig.  2).  We 
selected  265  over-expressed  genes  in  ALL  and  80over(cid:173)
expressed genes in AML compared to the other classes 
(Fig. 2). 

Validation of classifier genes probability 
To verify the selected classifier genes, we performed class 
predictions with classifier genes in the test group, which 
consisted of 9 AML and 3 ALL patients. A cross-validation 
and a test error rate calculation were performed with PAM 
using 345 genes. Our data showed a remarkable ability to 
discriminate  between  AML  and  ALL  in  the  test  group. 
Finally,  we successfully discriminated all  AML and  ALL 
patients using these 345 classifier genes (Fig.  3).

Discussion 
Microarray technology has been applied to haematological 
malignancy  studies  on  disease  classification,  outcome 
prediction, pathway delineation, and  target identification. 
Some of this work has been very successful,  and these 
successes encouraged some to declare the dawn of a new 
era of quantitative and predictive biology, in which networks 
of gene interactions will  be unraveled and  mathematical 
algorithms  will  be  used  to  diagnose  diseases,  model 
disease progression, and predict outcome and response to 
treatment. 

Identification of Gene Expression Signatures in Korean Acute Leukemia Patients 

1 01 

By the  middle  of 2003 over  a  hundred  publications 
indirect  applications  of  DNA 
concerned  direct  or 
microarrays to haematological malignancies (Ebert et at., 
2004; Margalit et at., 2005). These studies fell into several 
overlapping areas. The first type involved basic profiling 
studies,  which  concerned  the origins and  aetiologies of 
tumors.  These studies often  involved  comparing  tumor 
gene  signatures with  signatures  of cells at a  particular 
haematological stage of development. Alternatively, the 
nature of aberrant gene expression  compared  with  the 
nearest  normal  cell  type  may  be  examined  to  reveal 
details  of  the  mechanism  of  tumorigenesis  or  tumor 
maintenance.  The  second  type  of  study  could  be 
described as classification studies, in which the aim was 
to identify the minimum set of genes required to define a 
particular tumor or tumor subclass.  Typically this study 
type follows on profiling studies and employs supervised 
clustering coupled with a machine learning algorithm or 
another type  of statistical  classifier.  The  best  of these 
studies have attempted to independently cross-validate 
the  classifier  set  using  further  arrays  or  conventional 
approaches in a new tumor sets. The third type of study 
involves  the  identification  of diagnostic and  prognostic 
markers.  In  this case,  supervised  learning  approaches 
are  employed  that are  similar to  associate  a  particular 
profile with a knownoutcome, the aim being to identify a 
small  subclass of genes with  predictive capability.  This 
might, for example, be coupled to a Kaplan-Meier survival 
curve to predict outcome for different tumor subsets, or to 
predict relapse or response to treatment. It is important to 
note that such classifiers can only be applied to defined 
tumor subsets. 

Genes highly expressed  in ALL in  the present study 
have been associated with the pathogenesis of lymphoid 
leukemias.  For  example,  annexin  A 1  was  highly 
expressed  in  ALL patients.  It was also reported to be a 
simple diagnostic marker for hairy cell  leukemia with an 
accuracy of 100% according to a previous report (Falini 
et  at.,  2004).  Amyloid  precursor  protein  has  been 
hypothesized  to  be  related  with  unknown  molecular 
mechanisms involved in leukemogenesis with ERG and 
ETS2 (Baldus et at.,  2004).  Moreover,  cathepsin C was 
proposed  to  be  a  significant  gene  for  large  granular 
lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia identification by expression 
profiling (Kothapalli et at.,  2003). 

Genes  highly  expressed  in  AML  include  B-cell 
related genes, such as pre-B lymphocyte gene 3,  B-cell 
linker,  lymphoid  enhancer-binding  factor  1,  and  early 
B-cell factor. The mechanism linking these genes to AML 
is not clear, which needs further investigations. 

The  classifiers  of  this  study  do  not  show  high 
concordance compared to previous studies. Golub et at. 

used  50 predictor genes to discriminate AML from ALL 
(Golub et at.,  1999). Twenty-five genes were chosen that 
were more highly expressed in AML  and 25 genes were 
more  highly  expressed  in  ALL  None  of  the  genes, 
however,  were  chosen  in  the  present  study  in  Korean 
population.  Although in the past years gene expression 
profiling has indeed shown great promise with regard to 
the  classification  of leukemia,  one  should  also  take  its 
limitations  into  account.  The  limitations  of  gene 
expression profiling are evident if the results of different gene 
expression  profiling  studies are  compared.  The quality of 
materials  used,  sample  processing,  the  application  of 
different  expression  platforms  and  the  wide  variety  of 
methods  used  for  pattern  discovery,  make  the  proper 
validation of the results of different studies difficult. 

In  Korea,  several  reports  have  been  issued  on 
microarray technology.  However,  to  date no  report has 
been  issued  on  the  use  of  this  technology  in  acute 
leukemia.  In  the  present  study,  we  identified  gene 
expression  profiles that differentiae AML  and  ALL We 
hope  that  this  approach  may  provide  broad  access  to 
high-quality  diagnoses  and 
in 
leukemia.
