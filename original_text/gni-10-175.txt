Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the leading causes of cancer deaths and can be caused by environmental factors as well as 
genetic factors. Therefore, we developed a prediction model of CRC using genetic risk scores (GRS) and evaluated the effects 
of conventional risk factors, including family history of CRC, in combination with GRS on the risk of CRC in Koreans. This study 
included 187 cases (men, 133; women, 54) and 976 controls (men, 554; women, 422). GRS were calculated with most 
significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism with CRC through a genomewide association study. The area under 
the curve (AUC) increased by 0.5% to 5.2% when either counted or weighted GRS was added to a prediction model consisting 
of age alone (AUC 0.687 for men, 0.598 for women) or age and family history of CRC (AUC 0.692 for men, 0.603 for women) 
for both men and women. Furthermore, the risk of CRC significantly increased for individuals with a family history of CRC in 
the highest quartile of GRS when compared to subjects without a family history of CRC in the lowest quartile of GRS (counted 
GRS odds ratio [OR], 47.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9 to 471.8 for men; OR, 22.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 344.2 for women) 
(weighted GRS OR, 35.9; 95% CI, 5.9 to 218.2 for men; OR, 18.1, 95% CI, 3.7 to 88.1 for women). Our findings suggest that 
in Koreans, especially in Korean men, GRS improve the prediction of CRC when considered in conjunction with age and family 
history of CRC.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC), also called colon cancer or large 
bowel  cancer,  includes  cancerous  growths  in  the  colon, 
rectum, and appendix [1]. With 655,000 deaths worldwide 
per year, it is the fourth most common form of cancer in the 
United  States  (US)  and  the  third  leading  cause  of 
cancer-related deaths in the western world [1, 2]. In Korea, 
CRC is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and its 
incidence is now dramatically increasing with the westerni-
zation of lifestyles [3]. According to statistics for Korea, the 
incidence of CRC was 9.8 per 100,000 men and 10.4 per 
100,000 women from 1999-2001 [4]. These incidence rates 

for CRC increased to 18.2 per 100,000 men and 13.7 per 
100,000 women in 2003 [5].

Given the high incidence of CRC and its significant cost to 
society,  the  ability  to  accurately  predict  the  possibility  of 
developing the disease using identifiable risk factors may 
help both physicians and patients prevent its occurrence [6]. 
Numerous  studies  have  identified  risk  factors  related  to 
CRC,  such  as  age,  sex,  family  history  of  CRC,  smoking, 
physical  activity,  aspirin/nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory 
drug (NSAID) use, vegetable intake, body mass index (BMI), 
alcohol consumption, and hormone replacement therapy by 
women [7-10]. 

Recently,  there  have  been  a  number  of  studies  that

J  Jo,  et  al.  Colorectal  Cancer,  Prediction  Model,  Genetic  Risk  Score  (GRS)

developed  a  risk  score  or  a  prediction  model  of  certain 
diseases, such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and cancers, 
using these identified risk factors [11, 12]. However, these 
risk scores or prediction models have excluded genetic risk 
factors.  Genetic  polymorphisms  contributing  to  certain 
disease  incidences,  such  as  CHD,  could  be  one  type  of 
emerging risk factor under investigation in studies generally 
focused  on  a  priori  selected  candidate  genes  [13,  14]. 
Advances in genome technologies have made it possible to 
genotype  and  evaluate  many  single-nucleotide  polymor-
phisms (SNPs) throughout the human genome to identify 
novel disease susceptibility genes [15]. 

A CRC prediction model has been developed in a previous 
study  that  estimates  the  probability  of  developing  CRC, 
given a specific age, risk factor profile, and time period in 
white  men  and  women  aged  50  years  and  older  [16]. 
However, genetic polymorphisms have not been included in 
the  study.  Another  prediction  model,  developed  among 
middle-aged  Japanese  men,  included  conventional  risk 
factors  without  genetic  risk  factors  [17].  A  recent  study 
developed a prediction of CHD risk, aggregating information 
from multiple SNPs into a single genetic risk score (GRS) 
and  determined  an  improvement  in  the  prediction  of 
incident CHD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) study [18]. 

From  recent  studies,  several  SNPs  that  may  play  an 
important role in triggering CRC have been introduced by a 
genome-wide  association  study  (GWAS)  among  whites, 
Japanese, and Chinese but not Koreans [19-22]. Moreover, 
prediction  models  that  were  developed  recently  were 
performed among whites and the Japanese population [16, 
17]. Previous studies have shown that combining multiple 
loci with modest effects into a global GRS might improve the 
identification  of  persons  who  are  at  risk  for  common 
complex  diseases  [23-25].  Therefore,  in  this  study,  we 
intended to describe a GRS by aggregation of multiple SNPs 
contributing  to  CRC  through  a  GWAS.  Furthermore,  we 
aimed to develop a prediction model consisting of conven-
tional risk factors as well as a genetic risk factor, such as GRS, 
in  Koreans  in  the  Korean  Cancer  Prevention  Study-II 
(KCPS-II). 

Methods
Study population

The initial study population included 200,595 individuals, 
20-77 years of age, who visited 16 health promotion centers 
nationwide  from  April  2004  to  December  2007  in  the 
KCPS-II. Of these, there were 325 confirmed cases of CRC 
[26],  but  132  cases  ≥55  years  of  CRC  onset  age  were 
excluded to obtain early-onset CRC cases. For controls, they 

were  recruited  from  the  Korean  Metabolic  Syndrome 
Research  Initiative  study,  a  part  of  KCPS-II,  in  Seoul, 
initiated in December 2005. A total of 9,128 individuals were 
recruited in 2006, and an additional 17,569 individuals were 
recruited in 2007. Therefore, the total Seoul cohort included 
26,697  volunteers.  Volunteers  from  the  first  round  had 
routine health examinations at the Health Promotion Center 
in university hospitals between January 2006 and December 
2007.  From  this  total,  1,004  individuals  were  genotyped 
using  Affymetrix  Genomewide  Human  SNP  Array  5.0 
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). However, 10 of 1,004 
individuals  were  removed  because  of  low  genotyping  call 
rates  (＜95%),  and  4  individuals  were  shown  to  have 
biological  relatives;  so,  one  member  of  each  pair  was 
excluded. Eleven and 2 individuals were also excluded as a 
result of gender mismatches [27]. An additional 6 cases and 
1  control  were  excluded  due  to  missing  anthropometric 
measurements  (height,  weight,  BMI,  waist  circumstance 
[WC],  and  blood  pressure  [BP])  and  self-reported  que-
stionnaire  information  (smoking  status  and  alcohol  con-
sumption).  A  detailed  description  of  the  KCPS-II  study 
design and methods of selection of controls in this study are 
published  elsewhere  [27].  Therefore,  a  total  of  1,163 
participants (men, 687; women, 476) were included in this 
study: 187 cases (men, 133; women, 54) and 976 controls 
(men, 554; women, 422). A written consent form was signed 
by all study participants, and the Institutional Review Board 
of Yonsei University approved the study protocol. 

Genotyping

DNA samples were isolated from the peripheral blood of 
participants and genotyped using Affymetrix Genomewide 
Human SNP Array 5.0 (Affymetrix Inc.) at DNA Link Inc. 
(Seoul, Korea). Internal quality control (QC) measures were 
employed to ensure accuracy of the data. The QC call rate 
(dynamic model algorithm) was ≥95%, and heterozygosity 
of X chromosome markers identified the gender for each 
sample. Genotype calling was performed by Birdseed (v2) 
algorithm. Chromosome Y was not analyzed. A total of 1,163 
individuals were genotyped via this platform in the analysis. 
PLINK (v1.07) was used to estimate identity by state (IBS) 
over all SNPs [28]. A default set of 426,019 SNPs was used 
for further analysis, as recommended by Affymetrix. In the 
quality assurance screening, we flagged SNPs with genotype 
call rates ＜ 95%, minor allele frequencies ＜ 0.01, and SNPs 
showing  deviation  from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium 
(HWE)  at  p  ＜ 0.0000001.  The  final  set  of  acceptable 
markers included 312,506 autosomal SNPs. Accuracy of the 
genotyping  was  calculated  by  Bayesian  robust  linear 
modeling  using  the  Mahalanobis  distance  (BRLMN) 
algorithm [29].

Chemistry and anthropometric measurements

Serum,  separated  from  peripheral  venous  blood,  was 
obtained from each participant after a 12-h fast and then 
stored  at  －70oC  until  analyzed.  For  anthropometric 
measurements,  WC  was  measured  on  exposed  waists 
midway between the lower rib and the iliac crest using a 
measuring tape. For difficult cases, WC was measured at 3 
cm above the navel. Weight and height were measured while 
participants were wearing light clothing. BMI was calculated 
as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m²). Both systolic 
and  diastolic  BP  was  measured  after  a  15-min  rest.  In 
addition,  each  participant  was  interviewed  using  a  struc-
tured questionnaire to collect information on smoking and 
alcohol consumption as well as demographic characteristics, 
such as age, gender, and family and past history of clinical 
diseases.  Cigarette  smoking  was  classified  into  never 
smokers,  ex-smokers,  and  current  smokers.  Alcohol  con-
sumption was divided into nondrinkers and current drinkers. 
Regular physical activity was tracked as either “yes” or “no”.

and

and CRC were: rs10083736 (GOT2), rs16987827 (DHX35), 
rs8046516  (GOT2),  rs9926182  (GOT2),  rs17523778

(H2AFY),  rs11150094  (WWOX),  and  rs9625253  (MN1) 
(Supplementary  Table  2).  Each  SNP  in  this  study  was 
assumed to be associated with risk according to an additive 
genetic  model,  which  performs  well,  even  when  the  true 
genetic  model  may  not  be  known  or  may  be  incorrectly 
specified [30].

A GRS was calculated on the basis of reproducible tagging 
of  SNP-associated  loci  reaching  genomewide  levels  of 
significance. In this study, the GRS was calculated with the 3 
SNPs in Korean men and 5 SNPs in Korean women showing 
the strongest association with CRC (p ＜ 10－6). The GRS 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

was created by two methods: a simple count method (count 
GRS) and a weighted method (weighted GRS) [31, 32]. Both 
methods  anticipated  each  SNP  to  be  independently 
associated with risk. We assumed an additive genetic model 
for each SNP, applying a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 to 
genotypes containing 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles, respectively. This 
model is known to perform well, even when the true genetic 
model  is  unknown  or  wrongly  specified  [30].  The  count 
model  assumes  that  each  SNP  in  the  panel  contributes 
equally to the risk for CRC and was calculated by summing 
the  values  for  each  of  the  SNPs.  The  weighted  GRS  was 
calculated  by  multiplying  each  beta-coefficient  by  the 
number of corresponding risk alleles (0, 1, 2). 

Outcome classification

The  principle  outcome  variables  were  prevalence  (n  = 
165) and incidence rates (n = 22), based on national cancer 
registry and hospitalization records. Although Korea has a 
national cancer registry, reporting was not complete during 
the time of follow-up, and consequently, hospital admission 
files were used to identify first admission events for CRC. An 
incident of CRC was coded as occurring, based on either a 
positive  report  from  the  national  cancer  registry  or  upon 
hospital admission for a cancer diagnosis [33]. According to 
the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10), CRC was coded as C18-C20 [34]. 

Statistical analysis

All analyses were conducted using PLINK version 1.06 
(Free Software Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) and SAS 
statistical software version 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA).  All  statistical  tests  were  two-sided,  and  statistical 
significance was determined as p ＜ 0.05. To evaluate general 
characteristics of the study population, means and standard 
deviations (SD) were calculated, and frequency of cigarette 
smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  and  physical  activity  was 
determined. Paired t-tests were performed to indicate the 
differences  between  case  participants  and  control  partici-
pants for both men and women. A X2 goodness-of-fit test 
was  used  to  assess  whether  SNPs  were  in  HWE  and  to 
determine differences in genotype frequencies between CRC 
cases and controls. The GRS was categorized into quartiles. 
The CRC risk associated with genotype was estimated as s 
ORs  and  95%  confidence  interval  (CI),  computed  using 
logistic regression with an additive genetic model. We also 
used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
and calculated the area under the curve (AUC; also known as 
the C statistic) to evaluate the discrimination power of the 
model.  In  addition,  internal  validity  of  each  model  was 
checked using bootstrap [35], while 10-fold crossvalidation 
was used for the external validity of each model (Supple-

Our analysis included 687 men (cases, 133; controls, 554) 

and 476 women (cases, 54; controls, 422), 20-77 years of

age  (SD)  was  42.9  (±  8.7)  years  for  the  study  popu-
lation-43.5 (± 8.9) for men and 42.0 (± 8.4) for women, 
respectively.  No  significant  differences  were  observed  in 
BMI, WC, systolic BP, or diastolic BP among case participants 
and  control  participants  for  both  men  and  women  (p  ＞ 
0.05); however, case participants were older and had a family 
history of CRC more than control participants in both men 
and women (p ＜ 0.001). 

Table  2  indicates  the  area  under  the  ROC  curves  for 
models that included both conventional risk factors and a 
genetic risk factor, GRS, compared with the AUC for the 
model that included only conventional risk factors. In the 
prediction model of CRC, we included age and family history 
of  CRC  as  conventional  risk  factors  and  counted  GRS  or 
weighted  GRS  as  genetic  risk  factors.  For  both  men  and 
women, including the GRS in the model increased the AUC 
over that observed when the AUC was based on only age or 
age and family history of CRC. For men, the AUC (95% CI) 
was  0.729  (range,  0.682  to  0.767)  for  conventional  risk

0.677 to 0.761) for conventional risk factors plus weighted 
GRS (p  ＜ 0.001). The AUC (95% CI) was 0.692 (range, 
0.647  to  0.732)  for  conventional  risk  factors  alone.  The 
increase in the AUC for the model with counted GRS was 
0.042  and  0.032  for  the  model  with  weighted  GRS.  For 
women,  the  AUC  (95%  CI)  was  0.650  (range,  0.615  to 
0.680) for conventional risk factors plus counted GRS (p ＜ 
0.001) and 0.646 (range, 0.612 to 0.674) for conventional 
risk factors plus weighted GRS (p ＜ 0.001). The AUC (95% 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

CI) was 0.603 (range, 0.569 to 0.637) for conventional risk 
factors alone. The increase in the AUC for the model with 
counted  GRS  was  0.052  and  0.048  for  the  model  with 
weighted GRS. 

We further examined the association between GRS and 
CRC risk for both men and women in the KCPS-II, with 
stratification  by  family  history  of  CRC  (Fig.  1).  The 
interaction between counted or weighted GRS and family 
history of CRC was significant in men, indicating a stronger 
genetic  effect  among  participants  with  a  positive  family 
history of CRC than in those without it (p for interaction ＜ 
0.05)  (ROC,  0.834  for  counted  GRS;  ROC,  0.822  for 
weighted GRS). Women with a positive family history of 
CRC in the highest quartile of weighted GRS had an OR of 
22.3 (95% CI, 1.4 to 344.2) and 18.1 (95% CI, 3.7 to 88.1) 
compared  to  those  without  a  family  history  of  CRC  and 
counted or weighted GRS in the lowest quartile, respectively 
(ROC = 0.826 for counted GRS; ROC = 0.818 for weighted 
GRS). However, they were not statistically significant (p for 
interaction  ＞ 0.05).  In  addition,  smoking,  alcohol  con-
sumption, BMI, and WC did not interact significantly with 
GRS (data not shown). 

Discussion

This  study  evaluated  the  ability  of  the  GRS,  which 
aggregates information from multiple genetic variants, to 
improve the prediction of CRC risk beyond the prediction 
risk afforded using conventional risk factors. For both men

and  women,  inclusion  of  counted  GRS  or  weighted  GRS 
increased  the  AUC  by  0.5%  to  4.2%  beyond  the  AUC 
provided by conventional risk factors, such as age and family 
history of CRC. Men with a positive family history of CRC 
and GRS in the highest quartile were determined to have a 
statistically  significant  increased  risk  of  CRC  than  those 
without  a  family  history  of  CRC  and  GRS  in  the  lowest 
quartile. However, women with a positive history of CRC 
and GRS in the highest quartile were determined to have an 
increased risk of CRC than those without a family history of 
CRC and GRS in the lowest quartile, but this result was not 
statistically significant. 

CRC  is  a  multifactorial  disease  involving  a  variety  of 
elements,  leading  to  the  development  of  clinical  mani-
festations [37]. This recognition had led to the development 
of  risk  assessment  tools  that  attempt  to  synthesize  the 
values  of  numerous  variables  into  a  single  statement 
regarding the risk of developing cancer [38]. In this study, 20 
SNPs  were  respectively  genotyped  in  Korean  men  and 
women. Among these SNPs, 3 SNPs in Korean men and 5 
SNPs in Korean women showing the strongest association 
with CRC were used for the calculation of GRS. The GRS was 
calculated using a linear weighting of 0, 1, or 2 for genotypes 
containing 0, 1, or 2 risk alleles, respectively. The weighted 
GRS was computed by multiplying each beta-coefficient by 
the number of corresponding risk alleles. However, when 
multiplying  each  beta-coefficient  by  the  number  of  cor-
responding risk alleles, negative values of beta-coefficients 
may be obtained in some genotypes of the SNPs. Therefore, 
it may affect the OR values for CRC when compared to the 
OR values for CRC determined using counted GRS. Still, the 
calculation results of both counted GRS and weighted GRS 
were similar to each other.

Cornelis et al. [31] and Ripatti et al. [32] used methods 
similar  to  the  GRS  created  for  our  study.  Several  other 
studies  have  reported  different  ways  of  calculating  risk 
scores for the prediction of diseases [39-41]. Horne et al. 
[39]  introduced  a  regression  method  for  calculating  risk 
scores that incorporated 3 genetic polymorphisms and other 
risk factors and found that the frequency of coronary heart 
disease  was  different  at  different  regression  score  levels. 
Ortlepp et al. [40] concluded that multiple SNPs are better 
than  single  SNPs  and  that  as  many  as  200  SNPs  may  be 
necessary for “reasonable” genetic discrimination. Aston et 
al. [41] suggested that a score based on 90 SNPs in 78 genes 
can predict the risk of breast cancer, but the identity of the 
SNPs  and  the  algorithm  for  calculating  the  score  remain 
proprietary.  An  alternative  way  to  calculate  GRS  using 
machine  approaches,  such  as  support  vector  machines 
(SVMs), could be introduced, as SVMs have already been 
used to deal with many biological problems, such as DNA 

expression profiles [42]. Still, further studies are needed to 
use  machine  learning  approaches,  such  as  SVMs,  for  the 
calculation of GRS. To our knowledge, there have been no 
studies evaluating a GRS using SNPs contributing to CRC for 
the prediction of the disease in the Korean population. 

The  present  study  evaluated  a  prediction  model  using 
counted GRS or weighted GRS together with conventional 
risk factors, such as age and family history of CRC among 
Koreans. The risk of CRC is said to increase in individuals 
with a family history of CRC, in particular those ＞50 years 
of age [43, 44]. From a recent study, a CRC prediction model 
was developed with known major risk factors of age, BMI, 
alcohol consumption, smoking status, and physical activity 
level  for  middle-aged  Japanese  men  [17].  Another  recent 
study  on  the  prediction  model  of  CRC  included  an  indi-
vidual’s age,  sex,  history  of CRC, sigmoidoscopy/colono-
scopy,  polyps,  family  history  of  CRC,  smoking,  physical 
activity,  aspirin/NSAID  use,  vegetable  intake,  BMI,  and 
hormone  replacement  in  women  [16].  In  our  study,  the 
prediction model of CRC was comprised of conventional risk 
factors, such as age and family history of CRC, together with 
the  GRS.  As  determined,  inclusion  of  counted  GRS  or 
weighted  GRS  revealed  improved  estimates  of  CRC 
prediction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors, 
such as age and family history of CRC. For example, when 
counted GRS were added to the prediction model of CRC 
consisting  of  age  and  family  history  of  CRC,  the  AUC 
increased by 4.2% in men and 5.2% in women, whereas the 
AUC increased by 3.2% in men and 4.8% in women when 
weighted  GRS  were  added  to  the  same  model.  Studies 
showing  significant  relationships  of  GRS  in  conjunction 
with  coronary  heart  disease,  type  2  diabetes,  and  breast 
cancer have reported that considering the contribution of 
multiple SNPs may improve the predictive value of GRS for 
such  diseases  [18,  31,  45].  In  other  words,  combining 
multiple loci with modest effects into a global GRS might 
improve identification of persons who are at risk for such 
diseases  [23-25].  For  example,  in  the  ARIC  study,  the 
contribution  of  multiple  SNPs  into  a  single  GRS  was 
responsible for an improvement in the prediction of incident 
CHD [18]. In a study that used counted GRS or weighted 
GRS to determine the risk for type 2 diabetes in US men and 
women,  individuals  in  the  highest  quintile  of  GRS had  a 
significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to 
those in the lowest quintile; however, the addition of GRS 
increased the AUC by only 1%. In this instance, the GRS was 
determined  to  be  useful  when  combined  with  the  joint 
effects of BMI and counted GRS or family history of diabetes 
and  counted  GRS  [30].  In  our  study,  individuals  in  the 
highest quartile of GRS had increased risk of CRC compared 
to those in the lowest quartile of GRS for both men and 

180

women. In addition, in strata of family history of CRC and 
GRS,  this  increase  was  even  higher  in  individuals  with  a 
family  history  of  CRC  in  the  highest  quartile  of  GRS 
compared to those without a family history of CRC in the 
highest quartile of GRS in both men and women. Still, there 
were statistically significant interactions in men but not in 
women. In this study, the most commonly used conventional 
risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, were 
also  not  included  in  the  prediction  model  of  CRC,  as 
smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  BMI,  and  WC  did  not 
significantly  interact  with  the  GRS.  Therefore,  further 
studies are needed to verify these results. 

A family history of CRC is commonly used as a surrogate 
marker for determining genetic susceptibility to CRC and 
remains one of the strongest risk factors for the disease [10, 
31,  46].  Approximately  25%  of  all  CRC  cases  occur  in 
individuals  with  a  family  history  of  the  disease  and  no 
genetic  disorders  [47].  In  addition,  some  retrospective 
studies have suggested that a history of CRC in a first-degree 
relative (a parent or sibling) elevates a person’s lifetime risk 
of CRC from 1.8-fold to 8.0-fold [10, 47]. This family history 
risk factor may encompass both genetic and shared environ-
mental components [31]. In our study, after controlling for 
age and GRS, the strong relationship between family history 
of CRC and risk of CRC persisted. These findings suggest 
that other risk loci remain to be discovered or that family 
history has a much larger shared environmental component 
than previously thought [31].

Our  study  was  not  without  limitations.  The  cross- 
sectional design precluded the determination of causality, 
and a prevalent case bias may exist due to the higher number 
of prevalent cases (n = 165) of CRC included compared to 
the  number  of  incident  cases  (n  =  22).  Combining  pre-
valence and incidence cases could introduce survival biases. 
Still, the 5-year survival rate for CRC in Koreans was 71.3% 
in 2009 while that in Americans, Europeans, and Japanese 
was 65.0%, 56.2%, and 65.2%, respectively [43]. It could be 
said  that  Koreans  have  higher  survival  rates  for  CRC 
compared  to  other  ethnic  populations.  Additionally,  this 
study is also a case-cohort study. Blood samples of prevalent 
cases used in this study were from baseline, and incidence 
cases during the follow-up period, suggested as prevalent 
cases in this study, might have been missed, as other blood 
samples were not taken. Therefore, those prevalent cases at 
baseline  might  have  become  incident  cases  or  mortality 
cases during the follow-up period. It is hard to say if this 
study was performed among survivors. Another limitation 
included  a  self-reported  family  history  of  CRC,  thus 
precluding the definitive exclusion of potential misclassi-
fications. The statistical power of the current study might be 
too low, as genotyping was performed separately for men and 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  3,  2012

women. In addition, performing multiple tests separately in 
both men and women may increase error rates. Although 
CRC affects men and women equally, gender differences in 
CRC may exist. For example, regarding colorectal polyps and 
tumors, men had a greater risk of polyps (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 
1.41 to 1.64) and tumors (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.68) 
than  women.  In  addition,  women  had  greater  number  of 
purely  right-sided  polyps  and  tumor  development  [48]. 
Therefore, detection of genetic effects separately in men and 
women may be needed. In addition, age differences in case 
and  control  participants  may  also  increase  error  rates,  as 
control participants may become CRC patients when they 
reach  the  case  age.  This  study  also  involved  the  lack  of 
validation  and  replication  of  the  current  study  results. 
Therefore, it is hard to say that there may have been a true 
association  between  GRS  and  CRC  in  Korean  men  and 
women. However, bootstrapping and 10-fold cross valida-
tion  were  used  for  internal  and  external  validity  of  this 
current  study.  Furthermore,  although  sigmoidoscopy/ 
colonoscopy  history  was  the  strongest  risk  factor  in  the 
previous study, this current study did not include it as one of 
the conventional risk factors of CRC. Cases included in this 
study were also relatively small. This study also excluded 
cases ≥ 55 years of CRC onset age to obtain early-onset CRC 
cases. Therefore, estimate effects of cases ≥ 55 years of CRC 
onset age were hard to be seen in this study. Finally, most 
SNPs found to be associated with CRC among the study 
population were not similar to those SNPs found in relation 
to CRC among other populations. It also could be due to 
differences  in  ethnic  population  and  the  ages  of  case 
participants  included  in  this  study  (cases  ＜ 55  years). 
Nevertheless, this relatively large-scale study demonstrated 
the effectiveness of the prediction model of CRC using the 
GRS consisting of only SNPs that associated significantly 
with CRC and evaluated the effects on the risk for CRC in 
combination with conventional risk factors, such as family 
history of CRC, with the GRS. Moreover, the present study 
included the Korean population, whereas previous studies 
involving CRC prediction models using conventional risk 
factors or the relationship of genetic risk factors to CRC were 
limited to white and Japanese populations [17, 20-22]. 

In conclusion, our  findings suggest that the  prediction 
model of CRC revealed improved prediction estimates when 
age,  family  history  of  CRC,  and  the  GRS  in  the  Korean 
population were included. Furthermore, when compared to 
those  in  the  lowest  quartile  of  GRS  in  the  presence  or 
absence of a family history of CRC, the risk of CRC was 
found  to  be  significantly  increased  in  individuals  with  a 
family  history  of  CRC  in  the  highest  quartile  of  GRS. 
However, it was statistically significant in men but not in 
women. Findings in this current study might provide a small

piece  of  evidence  in  prediction  of  CRC  for  reducing  its 
prevalence  and  incidence  rates.  The  prediction  model 
developed in this study needs to be validated or replicated in 
an independent population. Therefore, further studies are 
needed to be applied to the general population.
