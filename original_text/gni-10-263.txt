We developed a user-friendly, interactive program to simultaneously cluster and visualize omics data, such as DNA and 
protein array profiles. This program provides diverse algorithms for the hierarchical clustering of two-dimensional data. The 
clustering results can be interactively visualized and optimized on a heatmap. The present tool does not require any prior 
knowledge of scripting languages to carry out the data clustering and visualization. Furthermore, the heatmaps allow the 
selective display of data points satisfying user-defined criteria. For example, a clustered heatmap of experimental values can 
be  differentially  visualized  based  on  statistical  values,  such  as  p-values.  Including  diverse  menu-based  display  options, 
QCanvas provides a convenient graphical user interface for pattern analysis and visualization with high-quality graphics.

Introduction

Genomics and proteomics data are typically analyzed by 
hierarchical  clustering,  followed  by  visualization  with 
heatmaps [1-3]. Various algorithms have been implemented 
in the data clustering procedure [4]. The visualization of 
clustered  data  includes  tree-based  hierarchical  clustering 
patterns and heatmaps of experimental values [5]. Simul-
taneously  carrying  out  clustering  and  visualization  in  a 
single platform provides a convenient tool for choosing an 
appropriate clustering algorithm and finding patterns in the 
resulting heatmaps. Previously, bioinformaticists used pro-
grammable  tools, such as R and Matlab,  and commercial 
data-mining packages to analyze their data. A simple and 
integrated  program  will  allow  experimental  scientists  to 
intuitively identify meaningful patterns from a large dataset 
without requiring knowledge of scripting computer langua-
ges or statistical theory.

Herein, we introduce a user-friendly tool, QCanvas, which 
integrates diverse clustering algorithms and an interactive 
heatmap display interface (Fig. 1). This program directly im-
ports raw experimental data in a matrix format and displays 

these data in a heatmap. Various clustering methods can be 
applied to two-dimensional data, with the real-time genera-
tion of clustered heatmaps. Furthermore, subsets of heat-
map data can be selectively displayed, based on user-defined 
filters. QCanvas is an easy-to-use and powerful tool for fast 
data analysis and interpretation by bench scientists. Without 
any  knowledge  of  scripting  languages  and  without  any 
graphics-editing software, one can generate and customize 
tree-clustered heatmaps with high-quality graphics.

QCanvas: Implementation and Functions
Data clustering

QCanvas provides a total of eight popular measures for 
generating the similarity matrix－i.e., Correlation uncenter, 
Correlation center, Absolute corr-uncenter, Absolute corr- 
center,  Spearman  rank,  Kendall’s  tau,  Euclidean  distance, 
and City-block distance. All of these measures have typically 
been  included  among  the  data  clustering  methods  of 
previous  tools  [4].  In  QCanvas,  the  calculation  of  the 
similarity matrix is selectively applied to the data for the 
x-axis and the y-axis independently. Hierarchical clustering

is  simultaneously  carried  out  based  on  the  established 
similarity matrices. QCanvas provides diverse algorithms for 
hierarchical clustering, such as the average method, centroid 
method,  single  method,  and  complete  method.  QCanvas 
uses  a  standard  window-based  graphical  user  interface 
(GUI), providing multiple windows to comparatively visu-

alize patterns of various combinations of similarity matrices 
and hierarchical clustering methods. This program provides 
quantitative  trees  for  displaying  clustering  patterns  and 
similarity measures together.

QCanvas. Data retrieving, processing,
and  visualization  can  be  carried  out 
through interactive, user-friendly me-
nus.  QCanvas  provides  additional 
tools  for  the  optimization  of  size, 
color,  and  shape  of  trees  and  heat-
maps.

data for 20 selected genes in five cancer 
samples  were  used  for  this  demon-
stration.  Red  represents  up-regulated 
gene  expression,  and  green  represents 
down-regulated  gene  expression.  The 
scale  is  log2  (fold-change).  (A)  Input

Heatmap optimization for pattern recognition

QCanvas software recognizes text-based data in a matrix 
format.  For  demonstration  purposes,  a  small  microarray 
gene expression dataset is included in the software package 
and can be downloaded from the website (http://compbio. 
sookmyung.ac.kr/~qcanvas). Once the input data are im-
ported into the QCanvas window, a heatmap of the non- 
clustered data is displayed (Fig. 2A). The user can easily test 
various  data-clustering  and  tree-building  methods  on  the 
raw data and interactively select appropriate heatmaps with 
tree structures (Fig. 2B). The GUI provides various menu- 
based options to optimize the display of heatmaps, trees, and 
annotations. The colors, locations, and sizes of the trees and 
the annotations can be customized in a flexible manner. The 
scale and color scheme of the heatmaps can also be adjusted 
in an interactive window. The node colors can be customized 
for  positive,  negative,  missing,  or  zero  values.  The  color 
contrast between nodes can also be interactively adjusted. 
The overall vertical or horizontal size of a component of a 
figure can be customized and saved in postscript format for 
a high-image quality.

Data filtering for the selection of major markers

Heatmaps that are based on data clustering display the 
overall  profiles  of  the  experimental  values  for  the  given 
samples. QCanvas provides a data-filtering option to selec-
tively display data nodes satisfying a given threshold. In the 
example shown in Fig. 2C, data points with a 2-fold change 
(increase  or  decrease)  in  gene  expression  are  selectively 
displayed. In many cases, a dataset includes experimental 
values and statistical confidence levels together. The option 
for data filtering in QCanvas is useful for analyzing patterns 
in the experimental data that are statistically significant. One 
can filter the heatmap profiles using statistical confidence 
data  that  are  included  in  a  separate  file.  In  the  example 
shown in Fig. 2D, the gene expression data are filtered based 
on the p-values for the fold-change. QCanvas can import two 
separate files together for simultaneous data clustering and 
filtering. The GUI menu for data filtering enables the pattern

analysis to be performed easily, without the need for manual 
data processing or the use of scripting languages.

Conclusion

This report introduces QCanvas, a program that provides 
a convenient and powerful interface for the pattern analysis 
of large-scale omics data. This program enables the user to 
conduct data clustering, data filtering, and graphics editing 
simultaneously on an integrated platform. These steps are 
typically performed on omics data, such as DNA (or protein) 
microarray data. All essential functionalities were integrated 
into the user-friendly interface of QCanvas. The simple and 
intuitive  nature  of  this  tool  meets  the  practical  needs  of 
research scientists working on omics data who do not have 
expertise  in  bioinformatics  approaches.  The  program  is 
freely available with demo data and a step-by-step tutorial 
through  the  website  (http://compbio.sookmyung.ac.kr/ 
~qcanvas).
