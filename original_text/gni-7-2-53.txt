Abstract

the 

that 

fusion  of  vesicles  containing 

Recent  evidence  has  strongly  suggested 
the 
CAP/TC10  pathway  is  involved  in  the  trafficking,  dock-
ing,  and 
in-
sulin-responsive  glucose  transporter  Glut4  to  the  plasma 
membrane.  However,  little  is  known  about  how  the 
genes  employed  in  the  CAP/TC10  pathway  are  asso-
ciated  with  the  development  of  type  2  diabetes  mellitus. 
In  this  study,  we  sequenced  4  genes  of  the  CAP/TC10 
pathway  [SORBS1,  CBL,  CRK,  and  RHOQ]  in  24  in-
dividuals  to  identify  genetic  variations  in  these  loci.  A 
total  of  48  sequence  variants  were  identified,  including 
23  novel  variations.  To  investigate  the  possible  associa-
tion  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus,  3  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms  from SORBS1,  3  from CBL,  and  4  from 
RHOQ  were  genotyped  in  1122  Korean  type  2  diabetic 
patients  and  1138  nondiabetic  controls.  Using  logistic 
regression  analysis,  1  significant  association  between 
SNP  rs1376405  in  RHOQ  and  type  2  diabetes  mellitus 
[OR  =  8.714  (C.I.  1.714-44.29),  p  =  0.009]  was  found  in 
the  recessive  model.  Our  data  demonstrate  a  positive 
association  of  the  RHOQ  gene  in  the  CAP/TC10  path-
way  with  T2DM  in  the  Korean  population.

insulin 

receptor 

During  recent  years,  major  advances  have  been  made  in 
our  understanding  of  insulin  actions.  In  the  cell,  the  rec-
ognition  of  insulin  by  insulin  receptor  instigates  phos-
phorylation  of  several  intracellular  substrates,  such  as 
the  insulin  receptor  substrates  (IRS1-4)  (White  and 
Yenush,  1998),  calcineurin  B-like  protein  1  (Cbl1)  (Ribon 
and  Saltiel,  1997),  Src  homology  2  domain-containing 
transforming  protein  (Shc)  (Sasaoka et al.,  1994),  SH2B 
adaptor  protein  2  (SH2B2)  (Liu et al.,  2002),  and  p60DOK 
(Noguchi et al.,  1999).  Defects  in  genes  involved  in  the 
insulin  signaling  pathway  are  linked  to  the  pathogenesis 
of  type  II  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  (Zierath  and  Wall-
berg-Henriksson,  2002).
    In  the  CAP/TC10  pathway,  the  insulin  receptor  re-
cruits  and  phosphorylates  Cbl  proteins  through  an  inter-
mediary  adaptor  protein  called  SH2B2  (Liu, et al.,  2002). 
Binding  of  the  SH2  domain  of  SH2B2  to  the  phosphory-
lated 
facilitates  phosphorylation  of 
SH2B2,  which  then  serves  as  a  docking  site  for  Cbl  (Hu 
and  Hubbard,  2005).  Another  adaptor  protein,  termed 
sorbin,  and  SH2  domain-containing  1  (SORBS1),  which 
is  a  human  homolog  of  Cbl-associated  protein  (CAP), 
are  involved  in  the  targeting  of  Cbl  to  lipid  raft  micro-
domains  (Ribon  et al.,  1998).  Upon  phosphorylation  of 
Cbl,  the  Cbl/CAP  complex  provides  docking  sites  for 
the  recruitment  of  the  adaptor  protein  CRKII  and  the 
guanyl  nucleotide  exchange  factor  C3G  (Baumann et al., 
2000;  Ribon et al.,  1996).  Recruitment  of  C3G  results  in 
the  activation  of  the  small  GTP-binding  TC10  (protein 
product  of  the RHOQ  gene).  Activation  of  TC10  results 
in  cytoskeletal  rearrangements  that  are  needed  to  facili-
tate  Glut4  translocation  upon  insulin  signaling  as  well  as 
insulin-stimulated  glucose  uptake  (Chiang  et al.,  2001). 
A  recent  study  of  streptozotocin-induced  diabetic  ani-
mals  showed  that  Cbl  and  SORBS1  gene  expression 
was  significantly  reduced  and  that  the  activation  of 
TC10  was  also  abridged  (Gupte  and  Mora,  2006).  In 
spite  of  the  pivotal  role  of  the  CAP/TC10  pathway  in 
skeletal  muscle  and  adipose  tissue,  the  association  of 
effector  genes  with  T2DM  has  not  been  elucidated  well.
    In  the  present  report,  we  investigated  the  genetic  var-

iations  of  4  genes  encoding  major  components  of  the 
CAP/TC10  pathway-SORBS1,  CBL,  CRK,  and  RHOQ- 
and  analyzed  the  association  of  their  genetic  variations 
with  T2DM.

Methods

Subjects  and  measurements

We  studied  1,122  type  2  diabetic  cases  (586  men  and 
536  women;  age  56.2±8.80  years  (mean±SD),  BMI 
25.4±3.31  kg/m2)  and  1,138  nondiabetic  controls  (516 
men  and  622  women;  age  64.2±2.87  years,  BMI  23.7 
±3.7  kg/m2).  Diabetic  patients  were  recruited  from  a 
Korean  prospective  community  cohort  study  (Ansung- 
Ansan)  according  to  WHO  criteria.  Nondiabetic  controls 
had  no  history  of  diabetes  and  had  fasting  plasma  glu-
cose  levels  less  than  6.1  mmol/L  and  hemoglobin  A1c 
(HbA1c)  levels  less  than  5.8%.  The  study  was  approved 
by  the  institutional  review  board  of  the  Korean  National 
Institute  of  Health.  Written  informed  consent  was  ob-
tained  from  all  subjects.  The  clinical  characteristics  of 
subjects  are  shown  in  Table  1. 

Sequence determination of the human CAP/TC10 
pathway  genes

We  sequenced  all  exons,  including  exon-intron  bounda-
ries,  and  the  promoter  region  (approximately  1.5  kb)  to 
discover  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  24 
Korean  DNA  samples  using  the  ABI  PRISM  3730  DNA 
analyzer  (Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA). 
Twenty-eight  primer  sets  for  the  amplification  and  se-
quencing  analysis  were  designed  based  on  sequence  in-
formation  from  GenBank.  Detailed  description  about  pri-
mers  is  available  in  Supplementary  Table  1.  Individual 
sequence  variants  were  verified  on  chromatograms.

Genotyping

The  10  SNPs  were  selected  for  genotyping  based  on 
haplotype  tagging  and  minor  allele  frequency  (＞0.5%). 
SNPs  were  genotyped  using  amplifying  primers  and 
probes  designed  for  TaqMan  (Livak,  1999).  The  Primer 
Express  (Applied  Biosystems)  program  was  used  to  de-
sign  both  the  PCR  primers  and  the  MGB  TaqMan 
probes.  Information  regarding  primers  and  probes  is 
available  in  Supplementary  Table  2.  The  detailed  ex-
perimental  procedures  can  be  found  in  Park et al.  (2006).

Statistics

To  determine  whether  each  individual  variant  was  in 
equilibrium  at  each  locus  in  the  population  (Hardy- 
Weinberg  equilibrium),  χ2  tests  were  applied.  We  exam-
ined  the  linkage  disequilibrium  (LD)  coefficient,  γ2,  be-
tween  all  pairs  of  biallelic  loci  (Hedrick  and  Kumar, 
2001).  Genotype  frequencies  were  compared  between 
patients  and  controls  in  3  different  modes  (codominant, 
dominant,  and  recessive)  by  using  logistic  regression 
while  controlling  for  age,  sex,  and  BMI.  Genotypes  were 
given  codes  of  0,  1,  and  2;  0,  1,  and  1;  and  0,  0,  and 
1  in  the  codominant,  dominant,  and  recessive  models, 
respectively.  The  SAS  statistical  software  package  (SAS 
Institute  Inc.  Cary,  NC,  USA)  was  used  to  perform  gen-
eral  statistical  analyses.  Statistical  significance  was  de-
termined  by  a  two-tailed  value  of  p＜0.05  for  logistic 
regression.

Results  and  Discussion

To  discover  genetic  variations  in  the  tested  genes,  we 
sequenced  all  exons  and  their  boundaries,  including  1.5 
kb  upstream  of  the  SORBS1,  CBL,  CRK,  and  TC10 
genes,  in  the  DNA  samples  of  24  unrelated  Koreans.  We 
identified  48  sequence  variants  (including  23  novel  poly-
morphisms):  15  SNPs  in  the  promoter  region  (1  SNP  in 
CRK,  8  SNPs  in  SORBS1,  and  6  SNPs  in  RHOQ),  1 
SNP  in  the  5’  UTR  of CBL,  2  synonymous  SNPs  in  cod-
ing  sequences  (1  SNP  in CBL  and  1  SNP  in RHOQ),  23 
SNPs  in  introns  (8  SNPs  in CBL,  12  SNPs  in SORBS1, 
and  3  SNPs  in RHOQ),  and  7  SNPs  in  the  3’  UTR  (3

    Next,  we  selected  10  SNPs  for  larger-scale  genotyp-
ing  based  on  LDs,  position,  and  frequencies  (＞0.05).

and  -1510T＞C  (rs3754554)  in  the  promoter  region  of 
RHOQ;  and  +751G＞A  (novel)  in  exon  2.  No  deviation 
from  Hardy-Weinberg  equilibrium  was  observed  in  the 
genotype  frequencies  of  the  10  SNPs  in  the  1138  non-
diabetic  controls.
    Associations  of  the  10  SNPs  with  the  risk  of  T2DM 
were  analyzed  using  logistic  regression,  with  adjust-
ments  for  age,  sex,  and  BMI  as  covariates.  The  results 
of  the  logistic  regression  analysis  are  described  in  Table 
2.  rs1376405,  located  in  the  promoter  region  of  the 
RHOQ  gene,  had  a  risk  for  diabetes  in  the  recessive 
mode,  with  an  odds  ratio  of  8.714  (C.I.  1.714∼44.29) 
and  a  p-value=0.009  in  the  comparison  between  non-
diabetic  controls  and  cases.
    Overexpression  of  the  RHOQ  gene  has  been  shown 
to  inhibit  insulin-stimulated  GLUT4  translocation  in  adi-
pocytes  (Hou  and  Pessin,  2007).  One  hypothesis  is  that 
the  genetic  variation,  rs1376405  in  the  promoter  region 
of RHOQ,  affects  the  expression  level  of  TC10  protein, 
which  in  turn  influences  Glut4  translocation  to  the  plas-

ma  membrane  upon  the  insulin  stimulus.  As  a  result,  the 
genetic  variation  of  the  RHOQ  gene  could  lead  to  the 
increased  susceptibility  to  the  development  of  type  2 
diabetes  mellitus  in  the  Korean  population.  With  further 
functional  studies  in  row,  the  rs1376405  SNP  in  the 
RHOQ  locus  could  be  exploited  for  the  prediction  of 
T2DM  in  the  Korean  population.
