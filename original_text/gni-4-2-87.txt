Abstract 
With  the  rapid  development  of  MS  technologiesy,  the 
demands  for  a  more  sophisticated  MS  interpretation 
algorithm haves grown as well. We have developed a new 
protein fingerprinting method using a binomial distribution, 
(fBIND).  Withthe  fBIND,  we  improved  the  performance 
accuracy of protein fingerprinting up to the maximum 49% 
(more than MOWSE) and 2% than( at a previous binomial 
distribution  approach  studied  by  of  Wool  et  a/.)  as 
compared  to  the  established  algorithms.  Moreover,  we 
also  suggest  a  the  statistical  approach  to  define  the 
significance  of  transcription  factors  and  motifs  in  the 
identified proteins based on the Gene Ontology (GO).

Introduction 
As the tendency in biology researches has been moved 
from analysis on few genes/proteins to macroanalysis on 
more extensive genes/proteins, MS has been recognized 
as key biotechnology. In particular, MS can be considered 
as the  most important tool  in  performing  proteomics to 
understand biological phenomenon of living organisms at 
the large-scale protein  level.  Accordingly,  a  number of 
recent  researches  presented  several  software  and 
algorithms that can effectively analyze the results of MS

and  relevant  researches  have  been  actively continued 
(Fenyo, 2000;  rogers et at.,  2003; Cutler et at.,  2003). 

While  PepSea  and  Peptldent/Multildent  identified 
proteins on the basis of the number of matches between 
peptide molecular weight in  database and peptide from 
experiments,  they  didn't  support  accurate  analysis 
(Mann  eta/.,  1993;  Wilkins  eta/.,  1999;  Wilkins eta/., 
1998).  MOWSE  used  scoring  method  that  reflected 
characteristics of database beyond  simple matches as 
calculating 
frequencies  of  peptide  generated  from 
proteins  at  10kD  intervals  (Rappin  et at.,  1993).  The 
researches  based  on  probability  are  MASCOT  that 
identified  more  reliable  analysis  as  calculating  the 
probability that  random  hit could  occur,  ProFound  that 
calculated probability values of proteins using Bayesian 
approach and research by Wool eta/. that made scoring 
method using binomial distribution (Perkins eta/.,  1999; 
Zhang et at.,  2000; Wool and Smilansky, 2002; Clauser 
et  a/.,  1999).  MassSorter  which  provides  visual  and 
user-friendly  interface  is  a  convenient  tool  to  analyze 
data from MS experiment (Barsners eta/., 2006). 

While MOWSE scoring algorithm that is widely used in 
general is simple and relatively accurate,  it has the limit 
to  depend  on  relatively  large  masses  among  peptide 
fragments in experiments. In accordance with the research 
by  Pappin  eta/.,  most  proteins  are  distributed  around 
50kD and peptides created as hydrolyzing these proteins 
in trypsin are mainly small fragments. As reported above, 
yeast proteins also showed the similar distribution (data 
not shown).  While most peptides from experiments are 
small fragments, fragments don't have substantial effects 
on MOWSE score, but a small number of fragments with 
relatively  large  molecular weight fragment  significantly 
influence on MOWSE score. As shown in Fig. 1(A), for the 
performance of MOWSE scoring, its accuracy is substantially 
decreased when molecular weights of peptides are small. 
This phenomenon  is  also appeared  according to intact 
molecular weight of protein as shown  in  Fig.  1(8). The 
reason  is  that  proteins  with  larger  molecular  weights 
create more peptide fragments and on  this occasion,  a 
number of fragments with  lower molecular weights are 
generated. This MOWSE scoring algorithm is also applied 
to other peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) programs such 
as MASCOT and MS-Fit. Although scoring algorithm in 
the research by Wool eta/. was based on relatively simple 
probability,  its  performance  was  very  remarkable  as

of peptide fragment ranges and intact molecular weights

tended  to  be  slightly  declined  because  of  repetitive

identify  proteins  more  accurately  as  making  up  for 
disadvantages of existing algorithms. 

Methods and Results

distribution approach. This incorrect result arose from many Repetitive peptides.p14907, p 87194 

peptide pool created by trypsin was built up. This peptide 
pool consisted of only peptides in 500-4000Da that was 
experimentally  significant  among  molecular weights  of 
peptides. Moreover, in consideration of errors caused by 
biological  experiments,  this study assumed the missed 
cleavage  level  of  trypsin  to  level  2  and  peptides 
generated  on  this  level  were  included  in  peptide  pool. 
Next, peptide pool generated by the process above and 
data  related  to  yeast  protein  were  used  to  construct 
database  using  MySQL  4.2.13.  Yeast  proteins  in  the 
database were 5,406 for SWISS-PROT 42 and 9,007 for 
NCB I nr.  Peptide pool generated by trypsin consisted of 
718,106  and  1,040,173  records  for  SWISS-PROT  42 
and NCBI  nr,  respectively. 

Improved algorithm for identifying a protein 
Like the research by Wool eta/.  scoring method in fBI ND 
calculated  probabilities  with  respect  to  binomial 
distribution  as  described  below  and  applied  overlap 
penalty to reduce impacts from repetitive sequences (Fig. 
3) and proportional relation between molecular weights of 
proteins and the number of peptides. 

N = total  number of peptides in a protein 
r  = number of random match 
p  = number of match I number of peptide in database 
k  = frequency of overlapping match in a protein 

Perfonnance of fBI NO 
The  results  by  fBIND  were  compared  to  those  by 
MOWSE  and  researches  by  Wool  et  a/.  in  order  to 
evaluate  performances  of  fBIND  that  were  modified 
above.  The  test  sets  for  analysis  and  comparison  of 
performance  randomly  selected  1 00  proteins  from 
SWISS-PROT  release  42  and  then  10  peptides  from 
each theoretical peptide pool. Next, random error values 
among e = {-0.999, -0.998,  --·, 0,  --·, 0.998, 0.999} in the 
calculated mass of each selected peptide were added up 
for the test sets. These test sets proteins were divided into 
the sets by molecular weight of eacha peptide ( <1500Da,

of  eacha  protein,  and  each  set  was  independently 
analyzed.  It was assumed  that missed  cleavage was  0, 
mass tolerance was 1 Da and there was no modification. 
Consequently,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2(a,  b),  MOWSE 
showed low accuracies of 40.4% (SWISS-PROT release 
42)  and  12%  (nr)  in  PMF  with  peptides  of  less  than 
1500Da.  The  accuracies  of  MOWSE  were  gradually 
improved  in  accordance  with  increases  of  molecular 
weights  of peptides.  For  peptides  below 4000  Da,  the 
performances of SWISS-PROT release 42 and nr were 
improved  up  to  92%  and  79%,  respectively.  This 
phenomenon  in  accordance  with  peptide  ranges  also 
influenced  on  performances according to intact protein 
molecular weights. As shown in Fig. 2(c, d), as the sizes 
of proteins became larger, performances were gradually 
decreased. 

Then,  in  the  range  between  190kD and  200kD,  the 
accuracies in SWISS-PROT release 42 and nr reached 
57%  and  31%,  respectively.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the 
performances of fBIND didn't show significant differences 
as compared to researches by Wool  et at.  It is because 
scoring method of Wool eta/. showed high performances 
of  99.1%  and  97.9%  in  average  in  accordance  with 
peptide ranges and  protein  ranges,  respectively,  when 
SWISS-PROT release 42 was applied, as shown in Fig. 
1. The fBI NO that considered influences by increases of 
random hit rates in accordance with increases of peptide 
fragments  and  repetitive  sequences demonstrated higher 
performances as compared to researches by Wool et at.  As 
illustrated in Fig. 3 (a, b), the performances in accordance 
with  peptide  ranges were  99.6%  and  97.1% for SWIS 
S-PROT release 42 and nr,  respectively, with increases 
of about 1% and  2% for SWISS-PROT release 42  and 
nr, respectively, as compared to study of Wool eta/. The 
performances in accordance with sizes of proteins were

Significant transaiption factor/motif analysis 
This study tried  to  identify proteins more accurately as 
improving  existing  algorithms  and  analyzed  significant 
transcription  factor/motif  analysis  to  provide  useful 
information on identified proteins. MATCHTM and PATCH 
TM  of  TRANSFAC,  representative  transcription  factor 
analysis  tools,  are  very  useful  to  find  out transcription 
factors  binding  on  specific  sequences  using  position(cid:173)
specific matrixes and patterns (Matys eta/., 2003; Kel eta/., 
2003).  Moreover, 
the  representative  motif 
database, is important database collecting motifs in each 
protein (Mulder eta/., 2003).  However,  all  of them don't 
provide  information  on  how  much  important  it  is  the 
contribution of transcription factors or motifs identified by 
those tools  and  database  on  functions.  In  accordance 
with analysis of transcription factors existing on upstream 
of  yeast  ORF  by  MATCH™  and  PATCH™,  it  was 
observed  that  a  number  of  transcription  factors  were 
abundantly  appeared  regardless  of  specific  functions 
including that HIF-1  was appeared  up to  1614 times on 
total 5,406 upstream. Therefore, this study tried to analyze 
significant transcription factors and motifs contributing on 
specific  functions  using  cumulative  hypergeometric 
probability distribution as described below. 

Process of transaiption factors and motifs analysis 
First  of all,  yeast  ORF  and  proteins  were  divided  into 
relatively detailed function categories of about 1 05 with 
reference to data annotated with respect to the process 
among GOtenninology in Saccharomyces Genome Database 
(SGD) (Dwight eta/., 2002). Then, mapping of ORF region 
on  chromosome was  conducted  using  sirn4  to  acquire 
transcription factors binding on upstream of ORF included 
in each function category {Florea eta/., 1998). As reported 
by Zhu eta/., -1000 regions from a translation start site was 
considered as upstream region and transcription factors 
in relevant upstream region were analyzed by MATCH ™ 
and  PATCH™  {Zhu  and  Zhang,  1999).  Motifs of each 
protein were acquired from lnterPro database. Transcription 
factors and frequencies of motifs in each function category 
segmented into 105 categories were calculated and then, 
transcription factors and motifs characteristically appeared 
in each function categoryvvere analyzed through cumulative 
hypergeornetric probability distribution as shown below.

When  p{X:::::  i}:::;  0.001  satisfied,  relevant  motif  is

transcription factors and  motifs specifically generated  in 
each function acquired by the process above. 

Estimation for analyzing transcription factors and 
motifs 
Table  1  described  motifs  and  relevant  characteristics 
existing in each protein.  013527 has integrase motif as 
the protein  included in  DNA recombination  among  1 05 
segmented  categories.  As  a  result  of  analysis  using 
cumulative hypergeornetric probability distribution, integrase 
catalytic  domain  is  a  specific  motif  that  is  appeared 
especially a lot in DNA recombination category and it is 
considered that it contributes on the functions related to 
DNA recombination of 013527. This result is the same as

GO  mapping  results  of  lnterPro.  P00330  falls  under 
G0:0006113 fermentation according to GO mapping of 
SGD and includes in energy pathway, the upper category. 
Zinc-containing  alcohol  dehydrogenase  superfamily,  a 
motif found  in  P00330,  is  especially  appeared  a  lot  in 
energy  pathway  category,  alcohol  metabolism  and 
aldehyde metabolism category. It contributes on functions 
related  to  energy  pathway  of  P00330  and  has  the 
possibility to take part in other functions such as alcohol 
metabolism  and  aldehyde  pathway.  lnterPro  doesn't 
provide information on this motif. In accordance with GO 
mapping of SGD,  P0041 0 was mapped to G0:0009060 
aerobic respiration and included in energy pathway, the 
upper category. Copper center cu(A), an identified motif, 
was a specific motif neither to energy pathway category 
nor to  other categories.  However,  cupredoxin,  another 
motif, was appeared especially in the same category as 
P0041 0 and  also the specific motif in  ion transport and 
response  to  abiotic  stimulus  category.  As  explained 
above, this study provided information about contribution 
of motifs  identified  in  each  protein  through  cumulative 
hypergeometric probability distribution on functions and 
suggested to broaden function annotation more extensively. 
In accordance with annotation of yeast protein with respect 
to process among  GO mapping data of lnterPro,  about 
53% oftotal yeast proteins could be annotated. Meanwhile, 
when  significant factor/motif analysis of this study was 
combined with lnterPro, about 83% of total proteins were 
covered {Table 2). The detailed GO mapping information is

Discussion 

As large-scale protein researches have been analyzed, 
researches  on  instrument  related  to  MS,  experimental 
techniques  and  PMF  algorithm  have  been  actively 
studied.  In  particular,  we need the algorithm to identify 
accurate proteins without being sensitive to experimental 
errors in order to identify effective proteins. In accordance 
with  the development of MS,  a wide range of research 
results from algorithms of simple matches to algorithms 
based on sophisticated probabilities has been reported. 
Each  algorithm  demonstrates unique characteristics  in 
accordance with scoring methods. For example, MOWSE 
scoring  method  based  on  frequency  that  consists  of 
mainly peptide fragments show lower performances, but 
that  with  peptide fragments  of high  molecular weights 
demonstrates significantly higher performances. 

Moreover,  for  PMF  based  on  binomial  distribution 
presenta::l in the researches by Wool et a/. the performance 
tends to be slightly decreased when  measured peptide 
is randomly matched to proteins with repetitive sequences. 

92  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 4(2) 87-93, June 2006 

Consequently,  this  study developed  the  system  showing 
better performances as making  up for scoring  methods 
based  on  MOWSE  and  binomial  distribution  among 
PMF  algorithms  that  have  been  studied  until  now. 
Furthermore,  this study tried  to  provide  information for 
interpreting peptide fingerprinting results for researchers 
as  analyzing  significant  factors/  motifs  related 
to 
regulations and activities of identified proteins as well as 
for accurate  identification  of proteins.  In  the future,  this 
study  will  provide  information  on  fBIND  with  respect  to 
protein-protein  interaction  data  and  protein  sub-cellular 
localization  information.  The  fBIND  is  available  at  http:// 
genepool.kribb.re.kr/pmf/ and  supplementary information  is 
available  at  http://genepool.kribb.re.kr/pmf!lnstruction/
