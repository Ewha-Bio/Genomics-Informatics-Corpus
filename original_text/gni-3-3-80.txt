Abstract 
HExDB  is  a  database  for analyzing  exon  and  splicing 
pattern  information  in  Homo sapiens.  HExDB  is  useful 
for  specific  purposes:  1)  to  design  primers  for  exon 
amplification  from  eDNA  and  2)  to  understand  the 
change  of  ORFs  by  alternative  splicing.  HExDB  was 
constructed by integrating data from AltExtron which  is 
the computationally predicted exon database, Ensemble 
eDNA annotation, and Affymetrix genome tile published 
recently.  Although  it  may  contain  false  positive  data, 
HExDB  is  good  starting  point  due  to  its  sensitivity.  At 
present, there are as many as 2,046,519 exons stored in 
the  HExDB.  We  found  that  16.8% of the  exons  in  the 
database was constitutive exons and 83.1% were novel 
gene exons.

Introduction 
Alternative splicing is a versatile mechanism for producing 
a variety of transcripts and to regulate gene expressions 
for eukaryotes (Matlin et at.,  2005).  An  accurate splicing 
mechanism is critical  for at least  15% of human genetic 
diseases that are caused  by a splicing error (Cartegni  et 
at.,  2002;  Caceres  et at.,  2002;  Faustino  et  at.,  2003; 
Pagani  et at.,  2004).  Recent  microarray data combined 
with  ESTs  suggest  that  73%  of  human  genes  are 
alternatively spliced (Johnson et at.,  2003). 

There  are  many  databases  of  alternatively  spliced 
genes.  Broadly, they can  be classified  into two.  One is 
based on experimental data while the other is based on

The  experiment  based  database  includes  ASDB 
(Dralyuk et at.,  2000),  AsMamDB (Ji  et at.,  2001), Xpro 
(Gopalan et at.,  2004) and AEdb (Thanaraj et at.,  2004). 
The  data  they  processed 
in 
MEDLINE, sequence data from GenBank (Benson et at., 
2004) and SWISS-PROT (Bairoch et at., 2004) database. 
The  computational  method  based  databases  include 
AltExtron (Clark et at., 2002), Asforms (Brett eta/., 2001 ), 
ASAP (Lee et at., 2003) and TAP (Kan et at., 2002). They 
determined  splicing  sites  through  an  examination  of 
alignments  from  EST  and  mRNA  sequences.  The 
computational approaches, however, can be error prone 
owing to a limited gene coverage and it does not have a 
good  confidence  measure  (Thanaraj  et at.,  2004).  In 
2004, 
Institute  (EBI) 
launched  ASD,  the  Alternative  Splicing  Database,  to 
is  also  a 
combine 
computation based database. Whatever the method, it is 
necessary  for  researchers  to  develop  an  efficient 
alternative  splicing  prediction  method  and  databases. 
For a  more  efficient genome-wide disease  research,  a 
more  sensitive  way to  find  exons  is  needed.  In  other 
words,  despite of possible false  positives,  detecting all 
the  possible  exons  is  an  important  starting  point  for 
alternative splicing research and a database construction. 
Here, we present a new database that aims for finding 
maximum number of exons. It integrates many databases 
tor  exons  such  as  transcriptional  maps  of  ten  human 
chromosomes published recently (Cheng et at.,  2005).

Methods 
Integration of existing databases 
To construct HExDB, AltExtron  (Clark et at.,  2002) and 
Ensembl  eDNA annotations  (Hubbard  et a/.,  2005)  are 
used to gather primary exon  data.  AltExtron  is  a com(cid:173)
puter- generated database by EBI.  Ensembl annotation 
is primarily based on biological literature. 

AltExtron contains specific information about individual 
exon.  However,  it  does  not  contain  the  exact  genomic 
coordinates. Therefore, we transformed (i.e., matched) the 
sequences  to  the  genomic  coordinates  using  BLAST 
sequence  search  algorithm  (McGinnis  and  Madden, 
2004) and a genetic database querying. AltExtron has a 
file format described in its database turep:lge, 1/WW'.J.fb.oc.uW

Ensembl eDNA annotations contain many references. 
We  filtered  out  much  reference  information  to  extract 
only  the  position  information  and  the  gene  IDs  exons 
belong to. The ensembl annotation is stored as EMBL file 
format.  We  used  BioPerl  Module  Bio::SeqiO  to  parse 
annotated files. All the source codes are accessible from 
the supplementary material page of our database site. 

Transcriptomic Map from Affymetrix 
National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  launched 
the ENCODE project. It stands for ENCyclopedia of DNA 
Elements. As one of the results, Affymetrix inc. proposed 
5bp  resolution  Transcriptome  map  of  ten  human  chro(cid:173)
mosomes constructed by a microarray approach (Cheng 
eta/., 2005). 

Profiles generated by the microarrays were filtered at a 
threshold to create exon regions. Cheng et at.  chose the 
threshold level for each chip so that 94.8% of the exons 
were  already  known  in  the  exon  region  assignment. 
Cheng  et a/.  used  the term  'transfrags' to  denote these 
regions. We followed the same procedure to integrate the 
transfrag data with other databases collected. 

Cheng  et a/.  searched  for transfrags  on  ten  human 
chromosomes for eight kinds of cancer cell lines. Due to

Results and Discussion 
The number of Exons in HExDB 
29,853 exons were integrated into HExDB from AltExtron 
database. They belonged to 4,113 genes.  The average 
of number of exons was 7.3 per each gene. The distribution 
of exons within each gene is shown in  Fig. 2(a). 

299,646  exons  were  integrated  into  HExDB  from 
Ensembl database annotation information. Most of them 
were well positioned on chromosomes. Table 1 and Fig. 
2(b)  show the statistics of them for each  chromosome. 
However, there were 1572 exons that did not belong to 
proper chromosome contigs.

1,717,035 exons were found.  However,  due to unclear 
boundaries,  redundant  entries  were  assigned  to  the 
same  exons.  To  reduce  this  redundancy,  we  treated 
overlapped exons as single exon. The final exon number 
became 499,17 4.  It means the true total exon number is 
perhaps between the two numbers. Therefore, a further 
research  on  accurately 
is 
necessary to get the exact number of human exons. The 
numbers  of  transfrags  on  the  ten  chromosomes  are 
shown in Table 2. 

redundancy 

reducing 

The total  number of exons in  our HExDB combining 
all  the  above  source  databases  was  2,046,519.  This 
figure contains some redundancy from the integration of 
the  source  databases  (see  Table  2).  However,  we 
suggest that this is about the upper limit of exons in the 
human  genome.  In  contrast to the  average number of 
exons  per each  gene  in  AltExtron  and  Ensembl,  if  we 
suppose human genome contains around 30,000 genes, 
68.2, the number of exons per each gene in HExDB is far 
larger than that in others. 

Exon  data  of  HExDB  can  be  accessed  by  using 
interactive  genome  browser  as  shown  in  Fig.  3  or  by 
downloading  MySQL  database  file  (see  Fig.  4).  The 
genome browser was constructed by using custom-track 
feature of the UCSC genome browser. 

Conclusion 
The purpose of HExDB is to  list all  the  possible exons 
that  can  be  predicted  and  annotated  by  current 
technology. There can be some redundancy due to this. 
However,  it  can  give  us  the  estimation  and  the  most 
number  of  exon  data  possible.  To  do  research  on 
alternative splicing, to list all possible exons are needed. 
The  contribution  of  HExDB,  therefore,  is  to  provide 
biologists useful tool for research on alternative splicing 
as  well  as  the  most comprehensive  exon  information. 
We found that there were about two million exons in the 
human  genome  from  the  existing  exon  data.  This 
number is by no means definite or accurate and will  be 
adjusted in the future. However, we predict that it is close 
to the upper limit of the total number of human exons. To 
our  surprise,  there  were  a  great  number  of  unknown 
exons. This indicates that the actual number of genes in 
the genome can be as high as 100,000 due to the high 
number of exons.
