Osteoporosis is a medical condition of global concern, with increasing incidence in both sexes. Bone mineral density (BMD), 
a highly heritable trait, has been proven a useful diagnostic factor in predicting fracture. Because medical information is 
lacking about male osteoporotic genetics, we conducted a genome-wide association study of BMD in Korean men. With 
1,176 participants, we analyzed 4,414,664 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after genomic imputation, and identified 
five SNPs and three loci correlated with bone density and strength. Multivariate linear regression models were applied to

Introduction

Osteoporosis  is  defined  as  a  chronic  condition  that  is 
characterized by low bone mass and the micro-architectural 
deterioration  of  osseous  tissue,  leading  to  fragility.  Bone 
mineral density (BMD) has been established as the most 
significant diagnostic factor for osteoporotic fracture [1, 2].
Although more widespread in women, about 1.5 million 

males over the age of 65 have osteoporosis and another 3.5 
million are at risk in the United States [3]. Among Korean 
men, the prevalence of the condition has also increased by 
about 7.5%, according to national health survey data [4]. 
Major risk factors of male osteoporosis are aging and lifestyle 
choices, such as smoking, alcohol, and lack of exercise [5-7]. 
Genetic factors may also play a significant role, because BMD 
has been observed to have similar heritability patterns in 
both men and women [8]. Thought to be heritable, BMD is

78% in the lumbar spine and 84% in the femoral neck [9]. Up 
to 100 genes, associated with BMD, have been identified to 
date by various genetic studies [10, 11]. One current meta- 
analysis identified 56 loci including 32 new regions asso-
ciated with BMD with highly significant level [12]. The study 
had  demonstrated  several  genetic  loci  such  as  myocyte 
enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), zinc finger- and BTB-domain 
containing 40 (ZBTB40), low-density lipoprotein receptor- 
related protein 5 (LRP5), and forkhead box L1 (FOXL1) which 
have been significantly replicated in Korean population in 
later studies [13, 14].

However,  the  influence  of  sex-specific  genes  remains 
unclear, because most of the research has been conducted on 
highly homogeneous population samples, mostly European 
post-menopausal  women  [11].  Several  investigations  of 
genetic components in male osteoporosis are available, but 
they rely on candidate data or produced no significant results 
[15]. Moreover, cases of East Asian populations as the parti-
cipating demographic are largely absent from the literature 
or consist of replications and attempts to confirm results 
already derived from Caucasian samples [13, 14, 16]. A recent 
study of a Korean group was able to newly identify several 
polymorphic factors, but unfortunately, it utilized BMD from 
the radius and tibia, which is less important in the develop-
ment of bone deterioration than that of the lumbar spine and 
hip bone [17]. Investigating the etiology behind osteoporosis 
in  males  of  East  Asian  descent  is  of  high  diagnostic  and 
clinical importance. Therefore, our study aimed to evaluate 
the role of genetic polymorphisms in forming the BMD at the 
lumbar spine and femur bone in Korean men.

Methods
Study populations

We selected non-osteoporotic participants who were tested 
via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry from the Center for 
Health Promotion and Disease Prevention of Seoul National 
University  Hospital  and  the  Gangnam  Center  for  Health 
Promotion. The subjects underwent regular health check-ups 
from May 2009 to December 2013. Our sample consisted 
exclusively of Korean men aged between 20 and 60 years. 
This initial step of the procedure was performed to detect 
genetic defects associated with obesity and metabolic syn-
drome [18, 19]. Those with conditions that could affect body 
weight  were  excluded  from  the  study.  We  also  excluded 
individuals who had taken any medication that might influ-
ence BMD, such as bisphosphonate, within the last 3 months 
or had a history of surgery or foreign body insertion at the 
spine or femur. After applying the above criteria, 1,192 sub-
jects  were  selected.  After  excluding  16  participants  who 
were  related  to  each  other,  our  final  sample  consisted  of 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  2,  2016

1,176 individuals.

Phenotype measurement

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Prodigy Advance; Ge-
neral Electric Company, Fairfield, CT, USA) measurements 
at the lumbar spine and femur were obtained from all pati-
ents,  following  standard  protocols.  We  distinguished  and 
analyzed  three  BMD  phenotypes—lumbar  spine  (L1-L4) 
(LS-BMD), femur neck (FN-BMD), and femur total (FT-BMD)
—identified here as the average value of mineral density at 
the neck and greater trochanter of the femur bone. 

Genotyping and quality control

All participants underwent a microarray assay, using the 
Illunina HumanCore BeadChip kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, 
USA).  We  filtered  out  poor  quality  single  nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) and samples, which were defined as 
SNPs  with  a  monographic  genotype,  a  Hardy-Weinberg 
−6, a call rate ＜95%, and a minor allele 
equilibrium p ＜ 10
frequency  ＜1%.  After  quality  control,  the  remaining 
264,283 SNPs were used in subsequent analysis. 

Genotype imputation

All missing genotypes were imputed in order to examine 
any potential effect of the unmeasured variants. We used 
1,000 Genomes ASN Phase I integrated variant set release 
(v3) in National Center for Biotechnology Information 
(NCBI) build 37 (hg19) as a reference panel, along with PLINK 
software (version 1.07) [20] for strand alignment, SHAPEIT2 
[21]  for  phasing,  and  IMPUTE2  [22]  for  the  imputation 
procedure. Only variants with Info Score ≥0.9 were included 
in the final count, resulting in a total of 4,414,664 SNPs, 
which were either genotyped or imputed with high confidence.

Statistical analyses

Multivariate linear regressions, adjusted for the effects of 
age and body mass index (BMI, weight/height2, kg/m2) [23] 
via an additive model, were used to further investigate the 
influence  of  SNPs  on  BMD.  Genome-wide  association 
patterns  were  analyzed  by  the  PLINK  software  package 
version 1.07 [20], while quantile-quantile and Manhattan 
plots  were  obtained  by  R  software  3.2.2  (2015  The  R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing). Regional association 
plots of the significant SNPs were generated by LocusZoom 
−6 were considered 
software [24]. All results with p ＜ 1 × 10
statistically significant.

Association with previously identified loci

We  attempted  to  determine  similarities  between  our 
selected markers and five other genes, which have previously 
been identified as indicative of osteoporosis in Korean male

populations.  Tumor  necrosis  factor  receptor  superfamily 
member 11 (TNFSF11) on 13q14, FOXL1 on 16q24, LRP5 
on 11q13.4, ZBTB40 on 1q31.3, and MEF2C on 5q14 have 
been connected to BMD in several different genome-wide 
association studies (GWASs)—an association confirmed in 
Korean males by a number of replication studies [13, 14]. We 
examined  the  most  significant  SNP  regions  of  these  five 
genes by applying our markers and considering only results 
with a p ＜ 0.05.

Ethics statement

The  study  protocol  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review Board at Seoul National University Hospital (IRB 
No. H-0911-010-299) and all participants provided written 
informed consent.

Results

The mean age of the study subjects was 49.57 years, with 
BMI values between 16.58 kg/m2 and 37.27 kg/m2. We exa-
mined  distribution  patterns  of  three  BMD  phenotypes: 
LS-BMD, FN-BMD, and FT-BMD. LS-BMD ranged between 
0.78 g/cm2 and 1.84 g/cm2 (mean ± SD, 1.21 ± 0.38 g/cm2), 
FN-BMD ranged between 0.64 g/cm2 and 1.93 g/cm2 (mean ± 
SD, 0.98 ± 0.14 g/cm2), and FT-BMD ranged between 0.29 
g/cm2 and 1.93 g/cm2 (mean ± SD, 1.04 ± 0.14 g/cm2) (Table 
1). We identified five SNPs with a significant influence on

BMD (Table 2). Fig. 1 illustrates regional plots of the five 
significant  SNPs  within  200  kilobytes.  No  genomic 
association  between  FN-BMD  and  any  polymorphic 
nucleotides was established. Quantile–quantile and Manhattan 
plots of the p-values are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.
Examination of genomic location revealed that rs1712-
4500, which was the polymorphic nucleotide most closely 
associated with LS-BMD, is generally detected in potassium 
channel, subfamily K, member 1 (KCNK10) in 14q31.3 (Fig. 
1A). Rs34594869 and rs17124504, were observed upstream 
of  regions  with  high  linkage  disequilibrium  constants, 
defined here as D’ ＞0.8. Rs140155614 was most prominent 
in the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase domain containing 
1 (AGPHD1) locus 15q25.1 (Fig. 1B). All four of these SNPs 
occurred as intron variants. rs111822233, the only sequence 
to  influence  the  mineral  density  of  the  femur  total,  was 
positioned around the nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, 
member 2 (NR3C2) in 4q31.1 (Fig. 1C). The function of this 
SNP is currently undetermined.

In addition to establishing links between genetic polymo-
rphisms and BMD, our studies aimed to identify loci previ-
ously  confirmed  as  osteoporosis  factors  in  Korean  male 
populations  in  order  to  verify  our  outcomes  (Table  3). 
Rs61382873 in LRP5 exhibited the highest association with 
LS-BMD (p = 0.0009). Rs9567003 (p = 0.0033) in TNFSF11 
and rs9935828 (p = 0.0248) in FOXL1 were also linked to the 
lumbar spine region, albeit with higher p-values. Patterns of 
rs33997547 (p = 0.0057) in ZBTB and rs1664496 (p = 0.0012) 
in MEF2C were correlated with FT-BMD, while rs61769193 
(p = 0.0114) in ZBTB was found to influence FN-BMD.

Discussion

We  identified  five  SNPs  and  three  genomic  regions, 
associated  with  BMD.  Four  of  these  SNPs  (rs17124500, 
rs34594869,  rs17124504,  and  rs140155614)  were  linked 
with LS-BMD and dispersed between two loci (14q31.1 and 
15q25.1).  One  SNP  (rs111822233)  found  in  4q31.1  was 
exclusively associated with FT-BMD. We also re-evaluated 
three previously established genetic relationships. First, we 
confirmed  the  connection  between  LS-BMD  and  the  foll-
owing loci: rs61382873 in LRP5, rs9567003 in TNFSF11, 
and rs9935828 in FOXL1. Next, we linked rs33997547 in 

ZBTB40 and rs1664496 in MEF2C with FT-BMD and anal-
yzed rs61769193 expression patterns in FN-BMD.
Three  of  our  significant  markers—rs17124500,  rs345-
94869, and rs17124504—were located on the KCNK10 gene. 
This channel protein, embedded in the cellular membrane, 
consists of two pore-forming P domains and regulates K＋ 
concentration. The role of potassium ions in maintaining the 
acid-base homeostasis of most organs and tissues, including 
bones, has been well established in the literature [25]. Addi-
tionally, KCNK10 is located on 14q31, a locus previously 
associated with LS-BMD in linkage analyses [26]. Although 
the relationship between the gene and osseous metabolism 

66

www.genominfo.org

is  not  clear,  it  is  highly  possible  that  its  translational 
mechanisms influence bone biological parameters.

rs140155614  was  prominent  in  the  AGPHD1  domain. 
Alternatively known as hydroxylysine kinase (HYKK), this 
protein-coding gene and its associated pathway, catalyze the 
GTP-dependent  phosphorylation  of  5-hydroxy-L-lysine. 
Located on 15q25.1, it has a well-known connection to the 
development of lung cancer. CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4, 
a gene complex near AGPHD1, has been linked to nicotine 
dependence in several genetic studies [27]. Current scientific 
evidence is insufficient in determining the role of this locus 
in BMD development and maintenance. Further research in 
the  area  of  the  gene’s  replication  patterns  is  needed  to 
validate or dispute a relationship with BMD.

rs111822233 was the only genetic marker with a direct 
relationship to FT-BMD levels. Located on 4q31.1, it is near 
NR3C2, a nuclear receptor involved in steroid signaling and 
regulation.  Mineralocorticoid  and  various  sex  hormones, 
such as testosterone and estradiol, alternatively bind to the 
protein, which influences their secretion via a feedback loop 
[28]. Bone resorption has been reported to increase with the 
withdrawal of these sex hormones. Although estrogen is the 
major steroid in regulating ossein metabolism, testosterone 
is also important in the resorption mechanism [29]. Moreover, 
prevalence of osteoporosis in the hipbone has been shown to 
increase in men whose testosterone levels are lower than the 
reference range [30]. 

As established in our introduction, research conducted 
with Korean participants tends to be inconclusive owing to 
extensive  focus  on  replication  of  results  obtained  by  the 
original GWASs. Thus, we attempted to bridge this gap in 
information  by  validating  previously  established  genetic 
linkages in Caucasian populations, whose significance has 
been confirmed in Korean men by replication studies [13, 
14]. LRP5, MEF2C, and ZBTB40 belong to the Wnt signaling 
pathway, which is largely related to cellular development and 
growth. Several studies have observed a link between this 
cascade and BMD [31]. We utilized a series of SNP markers 
from various Wnt-associated genes and were able to prove as 
association  between  rs61382873  in  LRP5  and  LS-BMD, 
between rs33997547 in ZBTB40 and rs1664496 in MEF2C 
and  FT-BMD,  and  between  rs61769193  in  ZBTB40  and 
FN-BMD.  TNFSF11,  also  known  as  receptor  activator  of 
nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) plays a critical role in 
adequate bone metabolism via activation of osteoclast cells 
to regulate resorption [31]. We identified a significant SNP 
marker in TNFSF11, rs9567003, which was related to LS-BMD. 
Our results were consistent with those of a previous genetic 
research,  which  has  established  a  connection  between 
TNFSF11 and BMD of the lumbar spinal cord [31]. FOXL1 
was originally identified by Genetic Factors for Osteoporosis 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  2,  2016

(GEFOS) and has been associated with LS-BMD in European 
sample  groups;  this  result  has  been  replicated  with  high 
significance  in  Korean  populations  [13].  Our  marker  in 
FOXL1, rs9935828, was also correlated with LS-BMD levels. 
In conclusion, we described a series of new loci and con-
firmed GWAS results in Korean male populations by work-
ing with skeletal-specific BMD and gene associations. 

There  were  several  limitations  to  our  study.  First,  no 
replications were performed to validate our results. Because 
indicators for measuring BMD in men tend to be narrow, 
recruiting a sufficient replication sample proved challenging. 
Thus, we aimed to use previously identified genetic markers, 
which have been established as valid in our selected ethnicity 
and gender. Despite our efforts, BMD is a less meaningful 
factor of osteoporosis in men than in women. Additionally, 
we could not consider all factors, including sex, age, weight, 
and menopausal status, owing to using only young men as 
our  test  subjects.  Finally,  we  needed  a  very  large  sample 
because phenotypic variations are hard to detect in homo-
genous populations. However, our sample size was too small 
to employ a Bonferroni correction, and we were forced to set 
−6, thus increasing 
the significant threshold as p ＜ 1 × 10
the chance of false-positives. To minimize statistical error, 
we  thoroughly  analyzed  gene  functions  and  mechanisms. 
Nevertheless, further research is necessary to validate our 
findings. 

In conclusion, our study identified novel loci correlated 
with BMD at 14q31.3, 15q25.1, and 4q31.1 in Korean men. 
Future studies should investigate these associations and the 
underlying genetic mechanisms.
