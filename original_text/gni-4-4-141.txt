Abstract 
We sequenced 1,841 BAG clones by terminal sequencing, 
and 1 ,830 of these clones were characterized with regard 
to their human chromosomal  location and  gene content 
using  Korean  BAC  library  constructed  at  the  Korean 
Science (KCGS).  Sequence analyses of the 1 ,830 BAC 
clones  was  performed  for  chromosomal  assignment: 
1,144 clones were assigned to a single chromosome, 190 
clones apparently assigned to more than one chromosome, 
and  496  clones  to  no  chromosome.  Evaluating  gene 
content of the 1 , 144 BAC clones, we found that 706 clones 
represented 1 ,069 genes of which 415 genes existed in the 
BAC clones covering the full  sequence of the gene,  180 
genes covering a 50%-99%, and 474 genes covering less 
than 50% of the gene coverage. The estimated covering 
size of the KBAC clones was 73,379 kilobases (kb), in total 
corresponding to 2.3% of haploid human genome sequence. 
The identified BAC clones will be a public genomic resource 
for mapped clones for diagnostic and functional studies by 
Korean scientists and investigators worldwide.

February 2001  (Lander eta/., 2001 ), and later published 
the sequence of the entire genome (International Hunam 
genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004). These Reports 
suggested  that  the  number  of  human  genes  may  be 
-34,000, significantly fewer than previous estimates that 
ranged from 50,000-140,000 (Roest Crollius eta/., 2000). 
Complete analyses of chromosomes 6,  7,  14, and 20-22 
have already been published. In October 2003, complete 
data for chromosome 6 were published online in Nature, 
and complete data for chromosomes 7,  14, 20, 21  and 22 
were published in July 2003 (Hillier eta/., 2003), February 
2003 (Heilig eta/., 2003), December 2001  (Deloukas et at., 
2001 ),  May 2000 (Hattori et at., 2000) and December 1999 
(Dunham et at.,  1999), respectively. 

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAGs) use F-factor(cid:173)
based  vectors and  are  suitable for propagation of DNA 
segments up to 300 kb in Escherichia coli (Shizuya et at., 
1992). Their stability over hundreds of generations, capacity 
to  hold  genomic  inserts  of  large  size,  and  ease  of 
manipulation have established BAGs as invaluable tools for 
a variety of applications in human genetics, most importantly 
for  the  mapping  and  sequencing  of the  human  genome 
(McPherson et at., 2001; Lander et at., 2001 ).As a result of 
the Human Genome Project, the majority of human genes 
are available in a characterized and sequenced BAG format. 
BAGs have many advantages for the cloning of large-insert 
genomic DNAs of a species and have been used for a variety 
of  genetic  applications,  including  physical  mapping  of 
chrorrosomes and large-scale sequencing of genomes. 

A BAG clone containing an entire specific gene locus 
was  used  to  study  gene  regulation  in  a  model  tissue 
culture-based system. Also, a BAC that lacked a putative 
negatively regulating promoter sequence was constructed 
and used to transfect cell lines (Bochukova eta/., 2003). 
These experimental systems illustrate the potential of BAG 
clones in large-scale gene expression studies, new gene 
therapy strategies,  and validation of potential molecular 
targets  for  drug  discovery  (Bochukova  et  at.,  2003). 
Several very efficient methods have been developed for 
manipulating  BAG clones  by  retrofitting  constructs with 
marker and selection genes (Mejia et at., 1997; Kim et at., 
1998; Wang eta/., 2001 ). Both nonviral (Hart eta/., 1998) 
and  infectious  (Wade-Martins  et at.,  2001)  novel  gene 
transfer approaches have been developed and  used for 
genomic clone delivery. A BAC library has been constructed 
to provide reliable and efficient materials for constructing 

142  Genomics &  Informatics  Vol. 4(4) 141-146, December 2006 

sequence-ready maps (Kim et at., 1996). Also, BAC clones 
have  been  used  to  identify SNPs  for specific genes or 
regions in the human genome and for physical mapping 
studies.  Map··based  cloning  and  genome projects  have 
identified many individual genes, and these genes will be 
useful for other applications in biotechnology, diagnostics 
and gene therapy.  In particular,  identified genes can  be 
used in trans9enic-based approaches for further functional 
analysis.  Therefore,  1 ,841  BAC  clones  were  randomly 
selected  from  the  Korean  BAC  library,  and  BAC  end 
sequences were determined. We obtained the information 
on the chromosomal locations of specific genes should be 
useful for studies of gene function and genomic analysis. 

Materials and Methods 
Construction of BAC library 
A total  of 100,224 clones for the Korean BAC library were 
prepared from male donor DNA,  and a 2.9-fold redundant 
KBAC library was constructed (Park et at., 2006).  100,224 
BAC clones Wi3re placed in both of 1 ,044 96-well plates and 
261  384-well  plates. And four superpooled KBAC libraries 
were constructed to quickly isolate desired BAC clones by 
colony PCR. 

Plasmid DNA extraction of BAC clones 
A single BAC colony was picked and inoculated into 2 ml 
2xYT medium containing  chloramphenicol  (6.25  flg/ml) 
and incubated with shaking for 16 h at 37"C. BAC DNA was 
isolated by the standard alkaline lysis method (Sambrook 
et at.  1989). After incubation, the cells were harvested by 
centrifugation  at  2,500  rpm  in  swing  bucket  Qiagen 
09366Ffor 10 rnin, and plasmids were purified with a plasmid 
purification  kit  (Qiagen)  following  the  manufacturer"s 
instructions. The supercoiled BAC DNA was isolated and 
digested  with  the  restriction  enzymes  Hindlll  or  Notl  to 
identify DNA inserts from the BAC plasmids. 

BAC end sequencing and analysis 
BAC  ends  WE!re  sequenced  using  BigDye  Terminators 
(Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems) with an ABI3100 and 
ABI3730 automated sequencer. The BAC end sequences 
were  determined  using  M13  oligonucleotide  primers: 
forward (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3'} and reverse 
(5'-CGA T AAC.AA TTTCACACAGG-3'). Reaction mixturess 
contained 0.5pg of DNA, 2,..1  of BigDye terminator mix, 50of 
universal and reverse primers consisting of 13 oligonucleotides 
in a total volume of 20fll. This mix was denatured at 95°C 
for 5followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 45sec, 55oC for 30sec, 
and  60°C  for  4min.  Excess  BigDye  terminators  were 
removed usin!~ the Montage SEQ Cleanup kit (Millipore). 

As a part of sequence analysis, computational KBAC clone 
system and a few database systems on analysis information 
of Korean BAC clones have been constructed to provide 
information of sequences homology and !~enes in the BAC 
clones and their lengths and chromosomal locations, and 
to  manage  BLAST  search  processes  and  results.  This 
system was consists of process manager and map viewer. 
Submitted forward and reverse sequences (the FAST A 
format)  of  BAC  clones  on  this  system  analyzed  using 
BLAST with an E-value better than 1e.10to human genomes. 
Human genomes data was used NCBI data (ftp://ftp.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov/genomes/H_sapiens/, build number: 35, version: 
1 ). The BLAST results were parsed by process manager, 
and the parsed data-set systematically stored in database 
system. Finally, process manager perform a database search 
to find the involved complete genes in the KBAC clones. 

Results and Discussion 
A total of 1 ,841  Korean BAC(KBAC) clone!s were randomly 
selected from a KBAC library containing 100,224 clones 
and were sequenced by BAC-end sequencing, which was 
performed and preserved by the KCGS. Of these, 11  clones 
have not been sequenced at the first step, but 1 ,830 clones 
were characterized and localized to specific chromosomes 
by BLAST search. BLAST analysis localized 1,144 BAC 
clones to chromosomes totaling 73.4 Mb, which corresponds 
to about 2.3% of the human haploid genome (Table 1 ). A

706 clones included 415 genes covering 100% of the whole 
gene sequence, 180 genes covering >50%, and 4 7 4 genes 
covering <50% (Table 2). The 415 fully covered genes may 
be used directly or indirectly to study gene function. The 
KBAC  sequence  information  also will  be  useful  for the 
unambiguous  identification  of  genomic  regions,  for

producing clones for functional studies. The 1 ,069 genes 
were  evenly  distributed  among  chromosomes  using 
sequence-based maps (Fig. 2). 

To evaluate the importance of individual BAC clones 
identified in this study, we perfonned sequence comparisons 
using  the  CancerGenetics  and  Cancer500  databases, 
which contain  1 ,584 candidate cancer genes.  Of these 

cancer genes, 45 genes were partially included in our BAC 
clones while12 genes, 2,970 bp, AXL(42,848 bp), CXCL9 
(6,018  bp),  CXCL 10{2,377  bp),  EWSR1(32,234  bp), 
HFE(9,611  bp),  SLC2A4(5,292  bp),  TERC(450  bp), 
TGM4(39,966 bp), THBS1(16,388 bp), TIMP1(3,380 bp), 
and TRIM29(26,868 bp) were completely included in the 
KBAC  clones  {Table  3).  Those  clones  could  provide 

genome sequences to isolate the whole gene and other 
applications (e.g., promoter analysis). 

Our SAC library of Korean is constructed for several 
purposes,  for example to  compare  nucleotide diversity 
among ethnic groups. This KBAC library will be a useful 
reference, especially for comparing the levels of nucleotide 
diversity in genome-wide regions. In addition, the KBAC 
clones  were  also  intended  to  be  used  for  SAC-based 
comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH)  analyses. 
Comparative genomic studies with vertebrate genomes 
will  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the  molecular 
mechanisms  responsible  for  vertebrate  novelties  and 
provide  insight into the origins of modern  species.  Our 
KBAC library will  benefit both biomedical and  biological 
communitiesfor  these  genomic  applications.  Recently, 
SAC-based CGH showed a significant impact in the field 
of cancer cytogenetics as a powerful tool for the detection 
of aberrations  in  chromosome  copy  numbers,  even  in 
epithelial solid tumors,  in which tumor-specific genomic 
alterations  are  difficult  to  detect  using  conventional 
cytogenetics (Veltman eta/., 2002; Albertson and Pinkel, 
2003;  Mantripragada  et  a/.,  2004).  Finally,  SAC  end 
sequencing  was  introduced  as  a  tool  for  virtual  library 
screening  to  search  for  SACs  overlapping  with  large 
sequence contigs and to establish a baseline from which to 
expand contiguous sequences. KBAC sequence information 
also  will  be  useful  for  the  unambiguous  identification  of 
genomic  regions,  for  obtaining  information  on  full-length 
genes, and for producing clones for functional studies. 

The  immediate  goal  of  this  study  was  to  obtain 
sequences of the  KBAC  clones.  These  sequences will 
be useful for a variety of genetic applications,  including 
physical  mapping  of chromosomes  and  sequencing  of 
large parts of the genome. The mapped SAC clones will 
serve as a valuable resource for reference sequences in 
highly  variable  regions,  for  promoter  analysis  and  for 
comparative genomics studies.
