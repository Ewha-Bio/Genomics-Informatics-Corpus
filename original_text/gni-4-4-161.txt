Abstract 
The  establishment  of DNA  microarray  technology  has 
enabled high-throughput analysis and molecular profiling 
of various types of cancers. By using the gene expression 
data from microarray analysis we are able to investigate 
diagnostic applications at the molecular level. The most 
important step in the application of microarray technology 
to cancer diagnostics is the selection of specific markers 
from gene expression profiles. In order to select markers 
of immortalization and transformation we used c-myc and 
H-rasv12 oncogene-transfected NIH3T3 cells as our model 
system. We have identified 8751  differentially expressed 
genes  in  the  immortalization/transformation  model  by 
multivariate  permutation  F-test  (95%  confidence,  FOR 
<0.01 ).  Using the support vector machine algorithm, we 
selected 13 discriminative genes which could be used to 
predict immortalization  and  transformation  with  perfect 
accuracy. We assayed H- rasv12-transfected "transformed" 
cells to validate our irrrmrtalizatim'transfonration dassification 
system.  The  selected  molecular  markers  generated 
valuable additional information for tumor diagnosis, prognosis 
and therapy development.

vaccines or proteins for therapeutics. Although the number 
of residual cells, substrates and adventitious materials is 
usually minimal  in the final  products,  we need to check 
whether these substances can lead to transformation and 
tumors in recipients. To check the tumorigenic potential of 
cell substrates, it is necessary to check the tumorigenicity 
in vivo using immunocomprimized animal models such as 
Balb/c-nu  mice.  However,  these  methods  are  time 
consuming and expensive making it impractical to test cell 
substrates candidates in this way. By using biomarkers for 
cellular  transformation  we  can  classify  cell  substrates 
according to their transforming potentials without the need 
for costly animal testing. 

Normal diploid cells can divide a limited number of times 
before entering  into an  irreversible growth  arrest termed 
replicative senescence (Hayflick, 1965). A small percentage 
of cells can acquire unlimited proliferation potential, which 
is a key step in tumorigenesis (Greider, 1999). Telomerase 
activity has been  reported to be sufficient to immortalize 
human diploid fibroblasts (Bodnar eta/., 1998), while other 
studies have shown that the c-myc oncogene fulfils many of 
the  criteria for a gene  involved  in  the  immortalization  of 
human epithelial cells (Bouchard eta/., 1998). 

Signaling from the small GTPase, Ras, has been under 
intense  investigation  over  the  past  decade  due  to  its 
involvement  in  mediating  the  pathways  that  control 
transcriptional activation. The pathways include mediators 
of critical and diverse cellular functions such as proliferation, 
development,  differentiation,  and  apoptosis (Ayllon and 
Rebello, 2000). Mutations conferring constitutive activation 
of Ras occur frequently in many types of human cancers 
(Bos, 1989). Signaling pathways downstream of Ras have 
been  fairly well  defined,  and  their contribution  to  Ras(cid:173)
mediated transformation has been studied extensively. 
With  the  aim  of  reconstructing  tumorigenesis,  we 
have  used  mouse  fibroblast  NIH3T3  cells  to  establish 
models for immortalization and transformation by c-myc 
and/or H-rasv12
.  The  gene expression  profiles of these 
cells  were  analyzed  by  Affymetrix  microarray  to  find 
differentially expressed genes in each group. Finally, we 
selected  13  genes  which  could  be  used  to  predict 
whether the  tested  cells  were  normal,  immortalized  or 
transformed with one hundred percent accuracy. These 
genes and algorithm may be useful  in the classification 
of cell  substrates to  predict their transforming  potential 
without the need for in vivo tumorigenicity assays.

Materials and Methods 
Immortalization and transformation model 
NIH3T3  mouse  fibroblast  cells  were  maintained  in 
DMEM  suppl13mented  with  10% FBS  and  antibiotics of 
penicillin/streptomycin at 37 oc in a humidified incubator 
with  a  5%  C02  atmosphere.  We  established  stable 
NIH3T3(c-myc)  cell  lines  by  transfecting  NIH3T3  cells 
with  pcDNAe-myc  using  Lipofectamine  (Invitrogen, 
USA) and  selecting stable transfectants with  Geneticin 
(Invitrogen,  USA).  The  other  cell  lines  like  NIH3T3(H(cid:173)
rasv12)  and  f\IIH3T3(c-myc+H-rasv12)  were  established 
the  same  procedure.  The  expressions  of 
using 
transgenes was checked by Western blot analysis (data 
not shown),  and  the in  vitro  and  in  vivo  transformation 
potential  of cells  was  checked  using  soft  agar assays 
and  by  tumor  formation  assays  in  Balb/c-nu  mouse, 
respectively. 

RNA extraction and microarray experiments 
Total RNAs from cells was extracted using Trizol reagent 
(Invitrogen Inc., USA) and purified by column chromatography 
(RNeasy, Qiagen) according to the protocol provided by 
the  manufactiUrer.  The quality of RNA was checked  by 
quantifying  260/280  and  260/230  ratios  and  by  gel 
electrophoresis  (data  not  shown).  Following  ethanol 
precipitation,  RNA  was  stored  at  -80 oc  after  ethanol 
precipitation. Labeling and hybridization was performed 
as described in Affymetrix microarray protocol (Kim eta/., 
2004 ).  The array used in this experiment was Affymetrix 
mouse  genome  430  2.0  array  which  includes  39,000 
transcripts. Many experiments for control, c-myc, H-rasv12, 
and  c-myc+H-rasv12  microarray  experiment  were 
quadruplicated producing a total of 16 sets of microarray 
data. 

Data analysis 
Fluorescence  intensity  was  processed  and  measured 
using  GeneChip scanner 3000  and  intensity data was 
imported to an in-house microarray database. In order to 
normalize  data  and  remove  systemic  variance,  RMA 
(Robust Multi--Array Average) normalization was applied 
to remove systematic variance (Irizarry eta/., 2003). The 
application of RMA allowed the  raw  intensity values to 
be  background  corrected,  log2  transformed  and  then 
quantile  norn1alized.  A  linear  model  was  fitted  to  the 
normalized data to obtain an  expression  measurement 
for each probe set on each array. 

To characterize the differences between immortalized 
and  transformed  cells,  we  identified  genes  that  were 
differentially E!Xpressed among control,  immortalized (c-

myc), and transformed (c-myc+H-rasv12) Glasses using the 
multivariate permutation F-test (Simonet a/., 2004; Korn 
eta/., 2004).The false discovery rate (FDR) was defined 
as the  proportion  of genes reported  to  be  differentially 
expressed by our assay that were false positives. We used 
the  multivariate  permutation  test  to  provide  a  95% 
confidence level where the false discovery rate (FOR) was 
less than  1%. 

Gene  ontology  (GO)  (The  Gene  Ontology  Consortium, 
2000)  groups  of the  selected  genes were  identified.  This 
GO  analysis  was  performed  to  provide  information 
regarding  whether the  list  of significant  genes  selected 
by  the  analysis  was  different to  a  randomly  generated 
list  selected  from  all  genes  in  a  given  GO  category. 
This  type  of analysis  is  different from  a simple  annotation 
of  a  gene  list  using  GO  categories.  The  data  was 
expressed  as  the  observed  vs.  the  expected  ratio  where 
the  observed  was  defined  as  the  number of genes  in 
the  list  of significant genes  which  fell  into  a GO  category. 
The  expected  was  defined  as  the  average  number of 
genes  which  would  be  expected  to  fall  into  that  GO 
category  in  a subset of genes  randomly  selected  from 
all  genes  in  the  analysis.  A  GO category  consisted  of 
not  only  the  genes  which  were  described  by  that  GO 
term,  but  also  any  gene  which  was  described  by  any 
members  of  that  GO  term. 

We  also  developed  models  to  predict the  class  for 
samples, where the gene ontology is unknown. Although 
the  95%  confidence  with  FDR<0.01  was  a  strict 
constraint,  the  selected  genes  were  too  numerous  to 
construct  a  prediction  model.  We  pe1iormed  another 
feature selection step to obtain compact gene sets for an 
optimal  prediction  model.  Particularly,  we  used  a 
method  of  gene  selection  utilizing  support  vector 
methods  (SVM)  (Vapnik,  1998)  based  on  recursive 
feature  elimination  (RFE)  (Guyon  eta/.,  2002).  Gene 
selection  with  SVM  based  on  RFE  13liminates  gene 
redundancy  automatically  and  yields  better and  more 
compact gene subsets. We also developed a prediction 
model using the Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) 
algorithm  with  a  logistic  regression  model  and  RBF 
kernel  (Platt,  1998)  incorporating  the  !~enes that  were 
selected  by  SVM  based  on  RFE.  W13  estimated  the 
prediction error of each model using leave-one-out cross 
-validation  (LOOCV),  which  is  a  special  case  of n-fold 
cross-validation, where n is the number of samples in the 
dataset (Tan eta/., 2005). LOOCV has the advantage of 
utilizing  as  much  data  as  possible  for  training.  In 
addition, the test sets were mutually exclusive, and they 
effectively covered the entire dataset. L.OOCV provided 
a  method  which  maximized  the  data  obtained  from  a 
small  dataset  and  while  generating  as  accurate  an 

Prediction Model for the Cellular Immortalization and Transformation Potentials of Cell Substrates  163 

controls,  respectively.  Immortalized  cells  could  form  a 
colony in in vitro tumorigenicity assay, but not tumor mass 
in in vivo tumorigenicity assay, while NIH3T3(H-rasv12
)  and 
NIH3T3(c-myc+H-rasv12
)  cells could make massive tumor 
in vivo as well as in vitro. 

Identifying and characterizing differentially 
expressed genes 
We identified 8,751  differentially expressed genes from 
control,  immortalized,  and  transformed  cells  through 
multivariate permutation F-test with 95% confidence and 
1% false discovery rate. Upon analysis of the distribution 
of those genes along the chromosomes, we did not find 
any  preferential  locus  among  20  chromosomes  of the 
mouse genome (Fig.  1 ). These results may indicate that 
the  transcriptional  regulations  of  immortalization  and 
transformation do not ioverlab. 

To identify the characteristics of the 8, 751  genes, we 
performed gene ontology analysis based on observed vs. 
expected 
ratio.  Our  analysis  showed  statistically 
overrepresented GO terms within a group of genes (Table 
2).  Five  categories  of  gene  ontology  were  related  to 
differentially  expressed  genes  in  the  immortalization/ 
transformation model. Oxidoreductase activity, especially 
related to superoxide radicals, was altered in our model. 
This  is  likely  to  be  important  in  DNA  damage  and 
mutagenesis.  In addition, the genes identified that have 
nucleotide  kinase  activity  are  likely  to  be  important  in

Results and Discussion 
Models for immortalization and transformation 
NIH3T3  mouse  fibroblast  cells  can  be  maintained  in 
monolayer cells,  but it cannot be grown in  soft agar. To 
establish models for immortalization and transformation, 
we introduced c-myc and H-rasv12 expression plasmid to 
NIH3T3 cells and selected stable cell colonies as reported 
previously (Wiehle et al.,  1990). The tumorigenic potential 
of  NIH3T3,  NIH3T3{c-myc),  NIH3T3(H-rasv12
)  and 
NIH3T3(c-myc+H-rasv12
)  cells  were  checked  using  the 
colony formation in soft agar and tumor formation in vivo 
in Balb/c-nu mice (Table 1 ). We compared the tumorigenicity 
using  Vera  and  Hela  cells  as  negative  and  positive

Fig. 2.  Expression profiles of known  c-myctarget genes like Thbs1  (thrombospondin1),  Dusp1  (dual specificity phosphatase 1), 
Gadd45a (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 alpha) and Mina (mycinducible antigen) 

aberrant  DNA  synthesis  and  metabolism  predisposing 
cells  to  transformation.  One  of  the  most  interesting 
categories  deleted  involved  stem  cell  factor  receptor 
binding which  may be  representative of cancer cell  de(cid:173)
differentiation in our model. 

We have picked several genes out of the DEG lists to 
explain the effects of each oncogenes.  In particular,  we 
tested four gmes, which have been reported to be targets 
of c-myc transcriptional regulation. All of these genes were 
up- or down-r-egulated by the expression of c-myc (Fig. 2), 
however, the expression of all four genes was also affected 
by the ectopic expression of H-rasv12
. In the cases of Mina 
and  Dusp1,  H-rasv12  induced  the  expression  of target 
genes  at the  level  of c-myc-dependent  regulation.  The 
induction  of Thbs1  by  H-ras v12  was  higher  than  that 
observed for c-myc.  More interestingly, the transcription 
of Gadd45a has been shown to be suppressed by c-myc, 
while  H-ras v12  could  up-regulate  Gadd45a expression. 
The  effect  of H-ras v12  was  sufficient  to  overcome  the 
suppression by c-myc and up-regulate the expression of 
Gadd45a  in  cells  expressing  both  c-myc and  H-ras v12
. 
Although we picked only four genes from the DEG list, the 
information on gene expression revealed many interesting 

regulatory relationships between diffemnt oncogenes. 

Constructing prediction model 
To obtain small sets of discriminative genes, we performed 
an additional feature subset selection process using linear 
SVM based on RFE and discovered 13 informative genes 
(Table 3).  We constructed a prediction  model using the 
SMO algorithm with a logistic regression model and the 
radial basis function (RBF)-kemel. The performance of the 
prediction model was assessed using LOOCV and was 
found  to  be one hundred  percent accurate for the data 
analyzed.  We also validated our prediction model using 
microarray data from four H-ras-transfected transformed 
cell lines and they were correctly dassified as a transformed 
class. 

In order to visualize selected biomark1ars, we performed 
hierarchical clustering of 13 gene with average linkage and 
Manhattan  distance  measures  for  a  total  16  sets  of 
microarray data (Fig. 3). The heat map illustrated that data 
from H-rasv12-transfected transformed cell ~H-rasv12) data 
were closely clustered with c-myc+H-rasv  2  calss. 

We  have  created  composite  profiles  for  an  in  vitro 
immortalization  and  transformation  model,  which  was

the power of analysis of this sysem, more profiles on cell 
lines and cancer tissues need to be divulged. Based on 
the wrapper approach w~ were able to select 13 genes to 
establish  a  prediction  model  for  immortalization  and
