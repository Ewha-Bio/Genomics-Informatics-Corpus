Abstract 
In a variety of animal species,  the perinatal exposure of 
experimental  animals to the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo(cid:173)
p-dioxin (TCDD) leads to the immune dysfunction, which 
is more severe and persistent than that caused by adult 
exposure.  We  report  here 
the  changes  of  gene 
expression  and  the  identification  of the  marker-genes 
representing the dioxin exposure. The expressions of the 
transcripts were analyzed using the 11 K oligonucleotide(cid:173)
microarray from the bone marrow cells of male C57BU6J 
mice after an  intraperitoneal  injection  of 1 pg  TCDD/kg 
body  weight  at  various  time  intervals:  gestational  6.5 
day(G6.5),  13.5  day(G13.5),  18.5  day(G18.5),  and 
postnatal  3  (P3W)and  6  week  (P6W).  The  type  of 
self-organizing  maps(SOM)  representing  the  specific 
exposure  dioxin  could  be 
follows; 
G6.5D(C14),  G13.5D(CO,  C5,  C10,  C18),  G18.50(7), 
P3W(C2, C21 ),  and P6W(C4, C15, C20). The candidate 
marker-genes  were  restricted  to  the  transcripts,  which 
could  be  consistently  expressed  greater  than  ±2-fold  in 
three  experiments.  The  resulting  candidates  were  85 
genes,  the  characteristics  of  that  were  involved  in  cell 
physiology and cell functions such as cell  proliferation and 
immune  function.  We  identified  the  biomarker-genes  for 
dioxin exposure:  smc -like 2 from SOM C14 for the dioxin 
exposure  at  G6.5D,  focal  adhesion  kinase  and  6  other 
genes from CO, and protein tyrosine phosphatase 4a2 and 
3 other genes from C5 for G13.5D, platelet factor 4 from C7 
for G18.5D, fos from C2 for P3W.

Introduction 
2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin  (TCDD)  triggers  a 
wide 
including  cachexia, 
hepatotoxicity, fetotoxicity, teratogenicity, dermal lesions, 
and  immunotoxicity  in  a  variety  of  animal  species 
(Grassman  eta/.,  1998;  Poland,  A.  and  Knutson,  J.C., 
1982). Acute exposure of adult mice to TCDD results in a 
selective suppression of proliferating cells of the immune 
system and hematopoietic stem cells (Luster eta/., 1980; 
Tucker  et  a/.,  1986).  But  the  perinatal  exposure  of 
experimental animals to the TCDD leads to more severe 
and persistent immune dysfunction than that caused by 
adult exposure (Gehrs eta/., 1997; Hollyday eta/., 1991 ). 
Exaggerated  thymic  atrophy  of  TCDD  exposed  on 
perinatal period is caused by the reduction of thymocytes 
and  of  terminal  deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase(TdT), 
which is lymphocyte stem cell-specific enzyme  (Fine et 
a/.,  1989). The reduced T-lymphoid-reconstituting activity 
by dioxin could be explained by the altered hematopoietic 
progenitor  Lin- Sca-1 +cells  (Murante  and  Gasiewicz 
2000).  The 
influence  of  TCDD  exposed  on  adult 
hematopoietic stem cells  (HSCs), which possess the ability 
to  reconstitute  long-term  multi-lineage  hematopoiesis, 
showed that the cell numbers of the CD34- Sca-1 + c-kit 
was  increased  about  four-fold  upon  a  single  oral 
administration  of TCDD,  but these  TCDD-treated  HSC 
cells  almost lost long-term reconstitution  activity (Sakai 
et a/.,  2003).  The  short-term  kinetics  of hematopoietic 
cells  exposed  on  TCDD  were  reported  as  follows;  The 
bone-marrow cellularity and colony forming unit-granulocyte 
myelocyte(CFU-GM) were severely decreased until day 
1  after  exposure,  but  soon  recovered,  even  overshot. 
and  subsequently,  decreased  and  oscillated  again  to 
and  under  the  control  value  (Yoon  et  a/.,  2001).  The 
long-term effect of TCDD exposure from fetal to adult on 
a stem cell activity was not reported until now. 

TCDD  exert 

its  effects  primarily 

the 
ligand-activated transcription factor, the aryl hydrocarbon 
receptor  (AhR).  The  cytosolic  AhR-dioxin  complex 
translocates  to  the  nucleus  where  the  AhR  dimerizes 
with  AhR  nuclear  translocator  (ARNT)  protein.  This

heterodimer then  binds  to  dioxin  responsive  elements 
(DREs) 
the 
Ah-responsive  genes  (Safe,  2001 ).  Exposure to  dioxin 
can trigger a large array of genes with diverse functions. 
Gene  microarray technology  is  ideal  to  study the  toxic 
effects  of  TCDD  because  of 
to 
simultaneously monitor the expression profiles of a large 
number of genes. Puga eta/. (2000) used a high density 
microarray to investigate the in vitro effects of TCDD on 
hepatoma  cells  and  reported  that  out  of  5686  genes 
screened, TCDD treatment up-regulated 114 genes and 
down-regulated  196  genes.  Differential  toxicogenomic 
response to TCDD in  malignant and  nonmalignant cells 
was  reported  (Martinez  et  at.,  2002).  Applying  the 
pathway-specific  eDNA  arrays  on  apoptosis,  cytokine 
production and  angiogenesis to the samples of various 
organs, it was found that, TCDD alters the expression of 
a large cluster of genes differently at a specific organs 
such  as the apoptotic genes in  the case of thymus and 
spleen, and the genes for angiogenesis in liver (Zytun et 
a/.,  2002). 

Likewise there is 5,000-fold difference in the LD50 for 
the TCDD between the species, the clinical manifestations 
are also diverse.  Although the residual  TCDD could  not 
be detected in the exposed individuals, the history of the 
dioxin exposure would  be  important in  immune system. 
Once the stem cells of immune system were damaged by 
dioxin,  its  effects  could  be  lifelong-lasting.  Beside  the 
importance  of  direct  measurement  of  dioxin  from  the 
environment or from the each individual, it is necessary to 
develop the toxicogenomic markers that could  reflect 
the  past exposure  of dioxin.  Until  recently,  the  gene 
expression  profiles  by  perinatal  exposure  of dioxin, 
and the biomarkers reflecting the past history of dioxin 
exposure  have  not  been  reported.  In  the  current 
study,  we  evaluated  the  stem  cell  activity  and  the 
global expression of transcript in bone marrow cells of 
male C57BL/6N mice by challenging TCDD from fetal 
to adult ages. 

Methods 
Experimental animals 
TCDD  at  concentration  of  1  11g/kg  body  weight  were 
injected  intraperitoneally  to  male  C57BU6J  mice  at 
various time intervals: gestation 6.5 day,  13.5 day,  18.0 
day,  and  postnatal  3  and  6  weeks.  The  animals  were 
sacrificed at postnatal  1 0 week 

Bone Marrow Isolation 
The bone marrows are isolated from femurs and tibiae by 

flushing  Hanks'  Minimum Essential  Medium containing 
5% fetal  bovine serum and  Penicillin-Streptomycin. The 
bone  marrow cells were further isolated  by filtering  the 
suspension through 80-gauge nylon mesh (TETKO Inc., 
Briarcliff Manor, NY) and centrifugation. The RBCs were 
removed  by resuspending the pellet in erythrocyte lysis 
buffer (0.17  M NH4CI,  10 mM KHC03,  1 mM EDTA) on 
ice,  and  washed  once  more.  The  resulting  pellet was 
resuspended  in HMEM, the cells were enumerated with 
a  Neubauer  hemocytometer.  and  the  viability  were 
evaluated.  The  cell  viability was  evaluated  with  trypan 
blue dye (0.08%), and that was determined to be greater 
than  90%  in  all  experiments.  Bone  marrow from  each 
animal was prepared and analyzed separately 

Colony fonning assay 
Bone  marrow  cell  was  then  collected  under  sterile 
conditions  and  counted  by  hemocytometer;  104 cells 
were plated in 35mm plates in triplicate in 2ml Methocult 
M3430 Methyl cellulose medium (Stemcell Technologies; 
Vancouver,  Canada)  per  plate.  Plates  were  kept  in  a 
humidified incubator at 37°C  and 5.0% C02 for 10days. 
Plates were read by light microscopy, and colonies were 
counted.  The  mean  ±SD  was  calculated 
for  two 
replicated studies, with a total of five mice per time point. 

Microarray Protocol 
Experimental  procedures  for  microarray were  followed 
as  described  previously  (Kim,  2003)  Total  RNA  was 
prepared from the bone marrow cells using the TRIZOL 
(Gibco BRL;  NY,  USA) according to the  manufacturer's 
instructions.  The  quality  of  the  RNA  prepared  was 
confirmed  by  analyzing  the  samples  on  a  denaturing 
1.2% agarose gels. Total RNA(10ug) was converted into 
double-strand  eDNA using the  eDNA synthesis system 
(Roche)  with  T7-(dT)24  primer.  Then,  each  eDNA  was 
purified  using  the  RNase  kit(Qiagen;  Valencia,  USA). 
Each Cy3-(control), or Cy5-(dioxin-treated) labeled cRNA 
was  synthesized  using  the  Megascript  T7  kit(Ambion; 
Austin, USA), with Cy3-CTP and Cy5-CTP(APB; Uppsala 
Sweden).  The  cRNA  was  purified  using  RNeasy 
(Qiagen) and fragmented in fragmentation buffer (40mM 
Tris  [pH  8.1],  100mM  KOAc,  and  30mM  MgOAC)  by 
heating to  94 OC  for  15minutes.  Fragmented  cRNA was 
mixed with hybridization buffer, containing 100mM MES, 
1M  NaCI,  20mM  EDTA,  and  0.01%  Tween  20,  and 
hybridized  with  MAGIC  II-10K Oligo  Chip  (Macrogen; 
Seoul, Korea) for 16 hours at42°C. The arrays were then 
washed  and  scanned  with  an  array  scanner(APB). 
Acquired images were processed and analyzed statistically 
for interpretation of spot intensity results using lmagene 

version 4.1  software (Roche).  Nonbiological factors that 
might contribute to the variability of data were minimized 
using  global  normalization/scaling  with  data  from  all 
probe  sets.  Each  chip  contains  a  total  of  10,368 
elements, of which  10,108 genes/clusters. The length of 
oligonucleotides was 50-mer. 

Results and Discussion 
Until  recently  major  efforts  were  concentrated  on  the 
highly  sensitive  and/or  easy  methods  to  evaluate  the 
contamination  of  dioxin  in  environment  or  biological 
samples (Behnisch  eta/., 2001).  In the case of immune 
dysfunction, of which cause is supposed to be the dioxin 
exposure  in  the  past,  there  is  little  report  on  the 
development of toxicogenomic markers in vivo.  Here we 
prepared  the  immune  compromised  mice  by  dioxin 
exposure,  and  carry  out  gene  expression  profiling  to 
develop the genomic biomarker of dioxin exposure. 

As  the  animals  were  exposed  to  the  dioxin  at  the 
earlier  period  of gestation,  the  proliferative  activities  of 
HSC  measured  by  colony  forming  counts(CFC)  were 
more  severely  impaired.  The  CFC  of  HSC  from  adult 
mice,  exposed to the dioxin at the gestational 6.5 days, 
were 45% of activity. As the exposure was the late point 
of gestation,  the  proliferation  activities of bone  marrow 
cells were less impaired by raging  50  - 65%.  When the 
mice were treated with dioxin after weaning period such 
as  postnatal  3  week  or  6  weeks,  the  CFC  were 
decreased to 70% of the control  (Fig.  1 ).  The result was 
compatible for the  previous report on  the importance of 
perinatal exposure of dioxin (Gehrs eta/., 1997; Hollyday 
eta/., 1991 ).  This suggests that the HSCs formed at the 
early  stage  of development  are  more  important  in  the 
immune  function  of  adult  by  continuous  supply  of 
immune progenitor cells.

Toxicogenomic Markers on Dioxin Exposure  77 

The  whole  transcript  of  bone  marrow  cells  were 
clustered  by  the  self-organizing  maps  (SOM)  (Fig.  2). 
Among  the 25  patterns,  changes of expression  level  at 
the specific stage could be found.  The SOM C14 shows 
the specific increment of the transcripts at the first time 
point,  G6.5D,  and  then  those  transcripts  decreased  at 
any  other  time  points.  The  exposure  of  dioxin  at  the 
G13.5D could be matched to the SOM CO, C5, C10, C18. 
In the case of C18 the expression pattern was inversed. 
Likewise,  the  dioxin  exposure  at the  G18.5D  could  be 
corresponded to the C7; P3W to the C2 and C21; P6W to 
the  C4,  C15  and  C20.  The  result was  summarized  as 
Table 1.

In developing  biomarkers,  it is important to  minimize 
the non-biological  variation  and  to be  reproducible  and 
confidential  results.  Subsets  of  genes  were  selected 
based  on  differential  Cy3/Cy5  expression  ratios  that 
were  :::0:  12  I  in  response.  Among  them  the  candidates 

78  Genomics & Informatics  Vol. 2(2) 75-80, June 2004 

were restricted to the gene shown repeatedly at the three 
independent microarray experiments (Bendiagrams not 
shown). Total of 178 gene could be selected: One gene 
for G6.5D and P6W, 153 genes for G13.5D, 17 genes for 
G18.5D, and 6 genes for P3W (Table2). Considering that 
the half-life of dioxin is 2 to 3 weeks in rodent, the most of 
the loaded dioxins might be metabolized and the residual 
dioxin  would  not  remain  at  the  point  of  sacrifice 
especially for the prenatal challenging group. This might 
have favored the similar patterns of the transcript profiles 
or  not-remarkable  changes  in  expression.  But,  as  we 
postulated  that  immune  stem  cells  would  be  damaged 
and  their  expression,  quite  different  changes  of gene 
expression were observed  for the  prenatal  challenging 
groups. For the 178 candidate genes, their characteristics 
were  analyzed  by  gene  ontology  (Table  2).  When 
excluded the 150 unclassified genes from G13.5D, most 
of  the  transcripts  were  categorized  into  physiological 
processes, especially involving cell  proliferation.

To  develop  biomarker  reflecting  past  exposure  of 
dioxin at a specific age, we selected the genes that could 
be find on both experiments of the SOM analysis (Table 

1)  and  the  triplicated  experiments  (Table  3).  The 
resulting candidates were shown as bold in Table 3.  As 
there  were  so  many  genes  for the  G13.5D  group,  we 
further  restricted  for  the  transcript  with  fold-changes 
greater than 10. Table 4 shows the Types of SOMs reflecting 
the past exposure of dioxin, and the corresponding gene of 
which  expression  was  changed  consistently  in  three 
oligonucletide-microarray  experiments.  Here  we  propose 
the toxicogenomic biomarkers for dioxin exposure are as 
follows; smc -like 2 from SOM C14 for the dioxin exposure 
at G6.5D; focal  adhesion kinase and 6 other genes from 
CO,  and  protein  tyrosine  phosphatase  4a2  and  3  other 
genes from C5 for G13.5D;  platelet factor 4 and  2 other 
genes from  C7 for G18.5D,  fos from C2 for P3W.  When 
applied the  above  criteria for selecting  biomaker genes, 
the quite proper candidate gene could  not be identified. 
But the cyp1A1  gene has been used as a maker genes 
for  the  recent  exposure  of dioxin,  there  would  be  not 
difficulty in using cyp1A 1 gene as a marker (Drahushuk et 
a/., 2001 ). The proposal of biomarker for dioxin exposure 
would be verified further by a variety of methods, such as 
RT-PCR,  or real  time PCR etc.  Although the individuals 
could be contaminated for the dioxin just only once, they 
would  actually  be  exposed  repeatedly.  So  further 
experiment to develop the biomarkers might be needed 
for the multiple exposure of dioxin.
