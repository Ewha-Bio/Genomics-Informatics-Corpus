Structural information has been a major concern for biological and pharmaceutical studies for its intimate relationship to the 
function of a protein. Three-dimensional representation of the positions of protein atoms is utilized among many structural 
information  repositories  that  have  been  published.  The  reliability  of  the  torsional  system,  which  represents  the  native 
processes of structural change in the structural analysis, was partially proven with previous structural alignment studies. Here, a 
web server providing structural information and analysis based on the backbone torsional representation of a protein structure is 
newly introduced. The web server offers functions of secondary structure database search, secondary structure calculation, and 
pair-wise  protein  structure  comparison,  based  on  a  backbone  torsion  angle  representation  system.  Application  of  the 
implementation in pair-wise structural alignment showed highly accurate results. The information derived from this web server 
might be further utilized in the field of ab initio protein structure modeling or protein homology-related analyses.

Introduction

Protein is a primary component of living organisms that 
has structural and chemical roles. Among the many charac-
ters of proteins, the structural information has been a major 
concern  for  biological  and  pharmaceutical  studies  for  its 
intimate relationship to the function of the protein. Most of 
the databases of protein structure utilize structure analysis, 
based on the 3D representation of the positions of protein 
atoms. The space of possible positions of atoms of proteins, 
however, could be described using the torsional represen-
tation of atoms along the axis of covalent single bonds. Most 
of  the  movements  of  atoms  are  actually  limited  to  the 
rotations along the single bond axes, considering the rota-
tional property of covalent single bonds and the infrequency 
of the change of the length and angles of the covalent bonds 
for  high-energy  barriers.  The  reliability  of  this  torsional 

system, which represents the native processes of structural 
change in the structural analysis, was partially proven by 
previous research of structure alignment [1]. In most typical 
representation systems of protein structures, the 3D struc-
ture of proteins is represented by Cα atom positions on the 
Cartesian system. Better homology delineation was achie-
vable by applying the torsional representation of backbone 
structures than a typical Cartesian system in the structure 
alignment. The structures of two proteins were aligned using 
the information of the torsion angles of Cα atoms of the 
backbones to compare the structural similarity. The strings 
of  the  torsion  angles  of  the  two  protein  backbones  were 
compared using a sequence alignment algorithm. The con-
ducted  backbone torsion  angle-based structure  alignment 
has  advantages  over  typical  structure  alignment  methods 
from the comparison of backbone topology, rather than the 
general  globular  3D  shape  of  proteins  [2].  The  better

accuracy  of  the  torsion  angle  system  in  the  structural 
alignment  analysis  was  utilized  for  the  construction  of  a 
relevant  information  repository.  Thus,  a  structural  infor-
mation repository and analysis tool based on better struc-
tural representation of a torsional system might be appre-
ciable.  Here,  the  secondary  structural  information-  and 
structure comparison function-providing web server, based 
on the backbone torsional representation of a protein struc-
ture, is newly introduced. The structure alignment function 
with torsion angles of amino acid backbones was supplied in 
a developed web server. Functions of secondary structure 
database search, secondary structure calculation, and pro-
tein  pair-wise  structural  comparison  are  supplied.  The 
secondary structure of protein data bank (PDB) and struc-
tural classification of proteins (SCOP) entries are supplied 
using  MySQL  infrastructure.  Protein  secondary  structure 
calculation and pair-wise comparison functions are supplied, 
based on JAVA/JSP infrastructure.

Computational Methods

The newly developed web server serves information of the 
constructed secondary structure database from prebuilt 3D 
structure databases using a classification scheme, driven from 
backbone  torsion  angles.  The  utility  of  protein  structure 
comparison, based on the backbone torsional representation, 
is also provided by the server. Details of the classification 
scheme of secondary structures, the comparison method, and 
the similarity measurements are as follows.

Secondary structure determination

Three  categories  of  “helix,”  “extended,”  and  “others” 
were used for the classification of the secondary structures of 
each  residue.  Secondary  structure  determination  for  each 
residue referred to the backbone torsion angle values. Amino 
acid  residue  was  classified  into  “helix”  if  the  backbone 
torsion angles belonged to the range of (φ, ψ) = (－155° to 
－47°, －62° to －52°), (－104° to －47°, －52° to －37°), and 
(－117° to －104°, －52° to －37°). A residue was classified 
into  the  “extended”  secondary  structure  if  the  backbone 
torsion angles belonged to the range of (φ, ψ) = (－155° to 
－138°, 90° to 155°), (－140° to －64°, 90° to 180°), (－64° to 
－53°, 90° to 100°, or 110° to 168°). Residues with backbone 
torsion angles belonging to other ranges were classified as 
“others.” The range was determined based on typical Rama-
chandran plots.

Pair-wise structure alignment

Two measurements (RamRMSD and logPr) were used to 
determine the structural similarity of two aligned proteins, 
as described in the previous structure alignment study [1]. 

RamRMSD  was  named  for  the  value  representing  the 
distance  of  the  two  points  of  the  residues  on  the  Rama-
chandran plots of the two proteins. While RamRMSD is the 
root mean square deviation of the Euclidean distance of the 
φ and ψ angles of matched residues, which is similar to the 
measurement of Δt used by Karpen et al. [3], logPr is the 
statistical  quantity  that  describes  the  probability  that  a 
closer alignment than observed is possible. In this study, 
both the geometric  distance  of RamRMSD  and  statistical 
quantity  of logPr  were  utilized  for  the  assessment of  the 
structural  similarity  [2].  The  Euclidean  distance  can  be 
defined as follows:

D = (Δφ2 + Δψ2)1/2,

where D is the distance and

Δφ2 = (φ1 － φ2)2,  if (φ1 － φ2)2 ≤ 1802

(360 － |φ1 － φ2|)2,  if (φ1 － φ2)2 > 1802 

Δψ2 = (ψ1 － ψ2)2,  if (ψ1 － ψ2)2  ≤ 1802

(360 － |ψ1 － ψ2|)2,  if (ψ1 － ψ2)2 > 1802,

where φ1 and φ2 are φ angles from each residue and ψ1 
and ψ2 are ψ angles from each residue. Conditional terms 
are  added  to  find  the  smallest  distance  between  any  two 
angles with our －180° to +180° notation; i.e., for example, 
not to consider the distance of two angles, +180° and －180°, 
as 360° apart rather than 0° apart. The RamRMSD would be 
as follows:

RamRMSD = 

   
 

,

where n is the total number of residues to be compared 
and Dk is the distance of points of kth residues of each protein 
on each Ramachandran plot as defined above. RMSD is weak 
to small number of local deviations [4]. logPr circumvents 
this problem of the RMSD and is defined as the logarithm of 
the mean probability of finding a closer angular similarity 
than  the  observed  similarity  in  a  random  environment 
between each torsion angle pair of compared chains.

If the difference of the φ and ψ angles is defined as a 
vector Ω (ωφ1, ωψ1, ωφ2, ωψ2, … , ωφn, ωψn), where ωφk 
is the difference of two φ angles of the kth amino acid of each 
n-residue-long string and ωψk is the difference of two ψ 
angles of the kth amino acid of each n-residue-long string, the 
constant probability density function ρ(ω) and the Pr-value 
in a random environment could be mathematically written as

where n is the number of total residues being compared 
and every angular difference is presumed to be statistically 
independent. Because multiplied values range from 0 to 1, 
the  Pr-value  is  more  strongly  dependent  for  small  values 
than for large values. We used the logPr-value to circumvent 
a computational overflow problem and used log base 10 for 
easy  comprehension  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  the 
probability, Pr. Also, Bonferroni correction was applied for 
proper comparison of the similarities from protein pairs of 
different length. Thus, the logPr value could be defined as 
follows.

Global alignment with no gaps was performed using these 
two measurements. The comparison frame was shifted by a 
single residue for each frame with boundary conditions for 
the most similar alignment.

Parameter settings for alignments and clustering

Global alignment with a gap open penalty of 13, extension 
penalty of 3, and free end gap penalty was conducted for 
sequences  of  30  proteases  and  30  kinases.  A  UPGMA 
algorithm with bootstrapping of 100 replicates was used for 
tree  construction  from  a  sequence  of  proteases.  CLC 
bioinformatics workbench was used for alignment and tree 
calculation,  and  the  Geneious  workbench  was  used  for 
graphical representation. (8 + logPr), RamRMSD, and (1－ 
TM-score) were used for distance, and a Fitch-Margoliash 
algorithm  was  employed  for  building  trees  from  protein 
structures. TM-score was normalized by the size of the target 
protein of the comparison pair. An appropriate integer (8) 
was added to logPr to make distances positive. Trees were 
generated from a distance matrix using the FITCH program 
of the PHYLIP package. The Geneious workbench was used 
for graphical representation of trees.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis

ROC curve analysis illustrates the accuracy of a binary 
classifier with graphical representation of the specificity and 
sensitivity with varying threshold for the discrimination of 
true and false pairs on a plot. After setting a threshold for the

delineation  of  positive  and  negative  classes,  true  positive 
(TP),  true  negative  (TN),  false  positive  (FP),  and  false 
negative (FN) are defined. The sensitivity, or true positive 
rate (TPR), and specificity, or true negative rate (TNR), are 
defined as follows:

while numerical ROC values are also defined as follows:

where Ti  signifies the number of true  positives  ranked 
ahead  of  the  ith false  positive. An ROC curve  was drawn 
following these calculations. To draw the curve, the thre-
sholds  are  varied  from  the  ones  for  the  most  sensitive 
discrimination, where all predictions are positive, to the one 
for the most specific discrimination, where all predictions 
are negative. A good classifier would show high sensitivity 
and high specificity concurrently. The more accurate classi-
fier  displays  an  earlier  and  steeper  increase  of  the  curve, 
while a less accurate classifier displays a less steep increase 
in the lower left region. Thus, the area under the curve could 
possibly signify the accuracy of the classifier. Area under the 
ROC curve (AUROC) was calculated using approximations 
of the curve, with a grid width of 0.01.

Web Application Implementation

The secondary structure database was constructed from 
92,998 PDB chains and 64,799 SCOP entries based on the 
simple  classification  scheme  according  to  the  backbone 
torsion  angles  (http://lcbb.snu.ac.kr/TorsWebDB).  SCOP 
entry 3D structure files were obtained from the ASTRAL 
PDB style database [5-7]. The function of the calculation of 
new  secondary  structures  is  additionally  supplied.  The 
backbone  torsion  angle-based  structure  alignment  tool  is 
also  supplied  by  the  newly  developed  web  server.  The 
platform of the web application was built in the machine 
with an AMD phenome II quad-core CPU (3.0 GHz) and 
openSUSE  Linux  11.2  operating  system.  JAVA/JSP  infra-
structure  was  utilized  for  the  construction  of  the  server 
platform.

The web application introduced here offers functions of 
secondary  structure  database  search,  secondary  structure 
calculation, and pair-wise protein structure comparison. The

index page of the server web application supplies hyperlinks 
to the three functions, along with a general introduction and 
the explanation of the cases of limitations in the supply of 
data (Fig. 1). The query for each function is input, and the 
result is retrieved through JSP pages in coordination with 
MySQL  database  engines  in  the  case  of  the  secondary 
structure  database  search.  The  results  of  the  secondary 
structure  database  search  query  display  information  of 
entries of the searched database that satisfy the criteria (Fig. 
2). Protein structure comparison supports pair-wise com-
parison of proteins from both uploaded files and specified 
IDs  of  SCOP  entries,  and  the  result  of  the  comparison 
displays logPr and RamRMSD values as similarity measure-
ments and CPU times that were spent for the calculation of 
each value (Fig. 3). 

Example of Application

The robustness of the backbone torsion angle method in 

structure  alignment  was  partly  validated  before  by  the 
clustering analysis of 4 types of proteases [1]. More distant 
groups  of  proteins  were  used  for  the  assessment  of  the 
accuracy  of  the  backbone  torsion  angle  method  here.  A 
mixed set of 30 kinases and 30 proteases were clustered, and 
the accuracy of delineation was analyzed with the resulting 
1,770 pairs (Fig. 4). Trees of clustering from logPr (Fig. 4A) 
and RamRMSD (Fig. 4B) measurements showed an appa-
rent delineation of kinases from proteases. The distances 
between these two groups were very long, so that one could 
easily  recognize  the  perfect  separation  of  each  from  the 
other. The distances among kinases and proteases each were 
rather comparable in the case of logPr measurements, while 
RamRMSD  showed  much  shorter  distances  of  proteases 
than those of the kinases. The difference between the dis-
tances of the two measurements might have originated from 
the weighting of the smaller distance in the case of logPr, 
which might have caused the distances among kinases to 
shrink.  The  logPr  and  RamRMSD  tree  showed  a  smaller

showed  better  accuracy  than  the  TM-score 
result. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve  (D) shows  perfect performance  of the 
backbone torsion angle alignment with area
under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 1.0, while
the  TM-align  method  showed  similar  per-
formance with an AUROC of 0.6846 (RMSD)
and 0.6319 (TM-score) to that of a previous
set  of  little  functional  difference  [1].

distance  between  internodes  than  the  distance  between 
terminal  leaves  and  the  last  internode,  indicating  that 
structural  information  is  quite  homogeneous  within  the 
group  of  identical  functional  homology.  The  clear  dis-
crimination of two homology group members indicates that 
the  structural  classification  is  strongly  robust  with  the 
backbone torsion angle method, especially in the case of a 

lucid functional difference. 

The clustering tree from the TM-align RMSD measure-
ment did not show clear delineations between kinases and 
proteases,  while  it  showed  some  aggregations  of  each  as 
subclusters (Fig. 4C). Though 22 kinases were posed close 
to each other, members of this major cluster of kinases were 
in very close proximity to members of the protease group,

making them hard to be clearly separated from proteases, 
referring  the  pair-wise  distances.  Furthermore,  8  kinases 
were posed within the cluster of proteases. The distribution 
of pair-wise distances among 60 proteins was also rather 
even. This incomplete separation markedly shows the better 
ability  of  our  backbone  torsion  angle  method  than  the 
conventional  3D  alignment  algorithm,  like  the  TM-align 
method. The inferior performance of TM-align might be due 
to the inconsideration of connectional information among 
the matched Cα atoms. Neglect of this information might 
have made the algorithm crucially vulnerable to the similar 
ostensible shape, with different topology of the connecting 
backbones. According to our previous finding [2], the pro-
teins  generally  adopt  strong  globular  structures,  and  the 
most significant difference among proteins is the topology of 
the  backbone  structure.  Thus,  there  is  a  possibility  that 
TM-align might have been misled by the general globular 
positions of Cα atoms. This partly indicates the robustness 
of  backbone  torsion  angle  alignments  and  the  possible 
problems  of  3D  methods  that  neglect  the  connectional 
information of matched reference points.

The numerical measurement of accuracy of both of our 
new backbone torsion angle-based method and the typical 
3D  method  of  TM-align  was  performed  with  ROC  curve 
analysis (Fig. 4D). Fortunately, our new method, with both 
logPr  and  RamRMSD  measurements,  showed  perfect 
accuracy, with an AUROC of 1.0, which means that every 
pair-wise distance might be correctly classified as true or 
false  pairs.  This  clear  discrimination  reflects  the  long 
distance between the two groups in the trees of logPr and 
RamRMSD measurements (Fig. 4A and 4B). The TM-align 
method with RMSD and TM-score measurements, however, 
showed  no  marked  improvements  in  this  more  clearly 
distinctive set than the set of protease subtypes of a previous 
study [1], possibly indicating less robustness of 3D methods 
in more distinctive cases of functional differences. This is 
also shown by the similarity of the AUROCs of the RMSD 
(0.6846)  and  TM-score  (0.6319)  to  the  previous  ones  of 
0.5965 and 0.5494 each. The TM-score result showed worse 
performance than that of the RMSD result in the TM-align 
method assessment.

Conclusion

In this study, torsion angle-based representation of the 
protein backbone structure was utilized for the construction 
of a secondary structure information repository and analysis 
tool of pair-wise structure comparison. This web application 
provides a search interface for deposited secondary struc-
tures of PDB and SCOP entries and a secondary structure 
calculation  utility  for  the  user’s  own  structures.  It  also 

supports  a  pair-wise  protein  structure  comparison  utility 
that is more accurate than the typical 3D alignment method 
in both cases of clear functional differences, as shown here, 
and very similar functional homologies, as shown previously 
[1]. The web server tries to explain in as much detail as 
possible the changes and occurrence of exceptions along the 
computational processes.

A secondary structure search through a query string using 
sequence alignment algorithms might be possible for further 
improvements. Future protein structure research might be 
aided  more  through  a  secondary  and  tertiary  structure 
homology search utility. A tertiary and quaternary structural 
information repository might be possible to be newly built 
by  automatically  utilizing  the  possibility  of  1D  represen-
tations of protein structures using backbone torsion angles 
and better accuracy of structural homology delineations of 
the  comparison  tool  that  was  provided  here.  The  infor-
mation derived from this web application might be further 
utilized in the field of ab initio protein structure modeling or 
protein homology-related analyses.
