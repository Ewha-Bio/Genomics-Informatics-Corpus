Abstract

Single  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  in  the  promoter 
region  of  the  IL-1B  (interleukin-1)  gene  have  been  im-
plicated  in  a  variety  of  diseases  that  have  an  in-
flammatory  component.  However,  there  has  been  sig-
nificant  heterogeneity  among  study  results,  especially 
between  Caucasian  and  Asian  populations.  Recently,  it 
has  been  reported  that  SNPs  in  the  IL-1B  gene  affect 
transcription,  according  to  haplotype  context,  and  ge-
netic  association  studies  may  be  more  informative  if 
functional  SNP  haplotypes  of  population  are  analyzed. 
Therefore,  we  estimated  the  distribution  of  IL-1B  pro-
moter  haplotypes  in  433  Koreans  using  the  three  major 
functional IL-1B  promoter  SNPs  (IL-1B-1464,  -511,  and 
-31)  and  compared  the  results  with  those  in  Caucasians. 
The  difference  in  IL-1B  promoter  haplotype  frequency 
between  Korean  and  Caucasian  populations  was  stat-
istically  significant.  The  potentially  more  inflammatory 
haplotypes  had  higher  frequencies  in  Koreans  when 
compared  with  Caucasians.  These  Korean  haplotype  da-
ta  will  be  useful  for  future  association  studies  between 
IL-1B  SNPs  and  disease  risk.

SNPs  in  the  promoter  region  of  IL-1B  gene  have  been 
implicated  in  a  variety  of  diseases  that  have  an  in-
flammatory  component,  including  cardiovascular  dis-
ease,  gastric  cancer,  Alzheimer  disease,  and  periodontal 
disease  (Iacoviello  et al.,  2005;  Camargo  et al.,  2006; 
Griffin  et al.,  2000;  Kornman  et al.,  1997).  The  IL-1B 
gene  is  highly  polymorphic,  and  several  SNPs  have 
been 
frequently  associated  with  several  diseases 
(Iacoviello  et al.,  2005;  Francis  et al,  1999;  El-Omar  et 
al.,  2000).  However,  there  has  been  significant  hetero-
geneity  among  study 
results,  especially  between 
Caucasian  and  Asian  populations  (Camargo et al.,  2006;

results  with 

Lee  et al.,  2004;  Yang  et al.,  2004;  Zeng  et al.,  2003; 
Chang et al.,  2005;  Ma et al.,  2003;  Hodge et al.,  2001).
    Recently,  Chen et al  (Chen et al.,  2006)  reported  that 
SNPs  in  the IL-1B  gene  affect  transcription  according  to 
haplotype  context,  and  genetic  association  studies  may 
be  more  informative  if  functional  SNP  haplotypes  are 
analyzed,  rather  than  individual  functional  SNPs.  Further, 
they  showed  that  the  functional  haplotypes  differ  by 
ethnic  population.  These  findings  underlie  the  relevance 
of  population  haplotypes  in  the  design  of  genetic  stud-
ies  (Chen et al.,  2006).  In  view  of  these  findings,  we  es-
timated  the  distribution  of IL-1B  promoter  haplotypes  in 
433  Koreans  using  three  major  functional  IL-1B  pro-
moter  SNPs  (IL-1B-1464,  -511,  and  -31)  and  compared 
the 
in  Caucasian  and  African 
populations.  Although  the  IL-1B-3737  polymorphism  al-
so  had  allele-specific  differences  in  nuclear  protein  bind-
ing,  no  differences  in  promoter  activity  were  observed 
with  different  alleles  of  this  SNP  on  a  background  of  the 
other  SNP  sets  that  showed  higher  promoter  activity 
(Chen et al.,  2006).  Because  it  has  been  suggested  that 
the  functional  significance  of  IL-1B-3737  might  depend 
on  a  broader  haplotype,  we  used  the  three  SNPs  for 
haplotype  analysis.  Haplotypes  were  reconstructed  by 
PHASE  version  2.1,  using  previously  produced  genotype 
data  (Lee  et al.,  2004). 
    Of  the  possible  eight  haplotypes,  three  common  ones 
accounted  for  ≥98%  of  the  estimated  haplotypes  in  the 
Korean  population.  Table  1  shows  the  haplotype  fre-
quency  estimation  in  each  population.  The  potentially 
more  inflammatory  IL-1B-511T/-31C  haplotype  repre-
sented  53.5%  of  the  Korean  haplotypes,  compared  with 
33.7%  of  the  Caucasian  haplotypes.  So  far,  in  many 
previous  association  studies,  the  individual  SNP  ap-
proach,  most  frequently  using  IL-1B-511  and  IL-1B-31, 
has  been  adopted.  To  our  knowledge,  we  reported  first 
that  the IL-1B-1464  polymorphism  has  allele-specific  dif-
ferences  in  nuclear  protein  binding  and  is  associated 
with  a  clinical  disease  (Lee et al.,  2004).  The  biological 
implication  of  this  polymorphism  was  supported  by  in 
vivo  studies  by  Chen  et  al.  that  showed  that  the 
IL-1B-1464  polymorphism  has  substantial  allele-specific 
effects  when  both IL-1B-511  and IL-1B-31  were  alleles 
T  and  C,  respectively  (Chen et al.,  2006).  The  more  in-
formative  haplotype  1  (GTC),  containing  the IL-1B-1464 
polymorphism,  which  shows  the  highest  transcriptional 
activity,  represents  9.3%  and  6.0%  of  Korean  and 
Caucasian  haplotypes,  respectively,  whereas  haplotype

3  (GCT),  with  the  lowest  activity,  had  a  higher  frequency 
in  Caucasians  (64.8%)  when  compared  with  Koreans 
(44.2%)  (Table  1).  The  difference  in IL-1B  promoter  hap-
lotype  frequency  between  the  Korean  and  Caucasian 
(χ2=20.6, 
populations  was  statistically  significant 
p=0.000),  and  the  allele  frequencies  of  the  IL-1B-1464 
polymorphism  (rs#1143623)  were  also  significantly  differ-
ent  between  the  two  populations  (IL-1B-1464  G  allele 
frequencies  for  Korean  and  Hapmap  European=0.548 
and  0.672,  respectively)  (χ2=6.38,  p=0.01). 
    It  has  been  suggested  that  genes  that  are  involved  in 
immune  function  may  be  under  selective  pressure  in  di-
rect  interaction  with  the  environment  (Sawyer  et al., 
2004;  Kim et al.,  2005).  The  genes  that  influence  a  phe-
notypic  variation  between  populations  are  expected  to 
show  high  Fst  values.  Compared  with  the  Fst  value  for 
the  Caucasian-vs-Asian  comparison,  the  Fst  values  for 
the  African-vs-Asian  or  -Caucasian  comparisons  were 
remarkably  high  (Fig.  1).
    Previously,  we  reported  that  the  IL-1B-1464  poly-
morphism  contributes 
in-
testinal-type  gastric  cancer  among  Koreans  (Lee et al., 
2004).  As  a  curious  finding  in  our  report,  the  editor 
pointed  out  that  carriers  of IL-1B-1464  G  tend  to  have 
a  decreased  risk  of  diffuse-type  of  gastric  cancer,  which 
is  the  opposite  of  intestinal-type  gastric  cancer,  al-
though  both  intestinal  and  diffuse  types  of  gastric  can-
cer  are  related  to  Helicobacter  pylori-induced  gastritis 
(Furuta  et al.,  2004).  Our  results  showed  that  most 
IL-1B-1464  C  alleles  are  linked  to  the IL-1B-511T/-31C 
haplotype  (Table  1).  Considering  the  level  of  promoter 
activity  of  haplotype  2  (CTC),  we  cannot  exclude  the 
possible  association  between  this  haplotype  and  the  risk 
of  diffuse-type  gastric  cancer,  especially  depending  on 
interactions  with  other  regulatory  factors  (Lee  et al., 
2007).  Association  studies  that  use  individual  SNPs  ap-
pear  to  be  insufficient,  and  the  understanding  of  func-
tional  haplotype  structure  of  populations  could  provide 

the  development  of

potential  explanations  for  IL-1B-related  controversies 
and  ethnic-specific  associations.  Therefore,  we  believe 
that  these  Korean  haplotype  data  will  be  useful  for  fu-
ture  association  studies  between  IL-1B  SNPs  and  dis-
ease  risk.
