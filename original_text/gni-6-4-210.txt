Abstract

Due  to  the  polygenic  nature  of  cancer,  it  is  believed  that 
breast  cancer  is  caused  by  the  perturbation  of  multiple 
genes  and  their  complex  interactions,  which  contribute 
to  the  wide  aspects  of  disease  phenotypes.  A  systems 
biology  approach  for  the  identification  of  subnetworks  of 
interconnected  genes  as  functional  modules  is  required 
to  understand  the  complex  nature  of  diseases  such  as 
breast  cancer.  In  this  study,  we  apply  a  3-step  strategy 
for  the  interpretation  of  microarray  data,  focusing  on 
identifying  significantly  perturbed  metabolic  pathways 
rather  than  analyzing  a  large  amount  of  overexpressed 
and  underexpressed  individual  genes.  The  selected 
pathways  are  considered  to  be  dysregulated  functional 
modules  that  putatively  contribute  to  the  progression  of 
disease.  The  subnetwork  of  protein-protein  interactions 
for  these  dysregulated  pathways  are  constructed  for  fur-
ther  detailed  analysis.  We  evaluated  the  method  by  ana-
lyzing  microarray  datasets  of  breast  cancer  tissues;  i.e., 
normal  and  invasive  breast  cancer  tissues.  Using  the 
strategy  of  microarray  analysis,  we  selected  several  sig-
nificantly  perturbed  pathways  that  are  implicated  in  the 
regulation  of  progression  of  breast  cancers,  including 
the  extracellular  matrix-receptor  interaction  pathway  and 
the  focal  adhesion  pathway.  Moreover,  these  selected 
pathways  include  several  known  breast  cancer-related 
genes.  It  is  concluded  from  this  study  that  the  present 
strategy  is  capable  of  selecting  interesting  perturbed 
pathways  that  putatively  play  a  role  in  the  progression 
of  breast  cancer  and  provides  an  improved  interpret-
ability  of  networks  of  protein-protein  interactions.

Microarray  experiments  have  been  a  popular  approach 
for  identifying  marker  genes  that  are  related  to  the  pro-
gression  of  disease  by  providing  insights  into  ge-
nome-wide  gene  expression  data.  Conventional  analysis 
of  microarray  data  has  focused  on  finding  significantly 
overexpressed  and  underexpressed  genes  as  putative 
markers  of  disease.  This  has  been  useful  in  discriminat-
ing  the  roles  of  various  individual  genes  in  the  pro-
gression  of  disease  and  in  correlating  dissected  ex-
pression  signatures  with  clinical  outcomes  (Dhanasekar-
an  et al.,  2001;  Beer  et al.,  2002;  van’t  Veer  et al., 
2002;  Glinsky  et al.,  2004).  However,  comparing  ex-
pression  data  between  normal  and  diseased  conditions 
can  typically  yield  thousands  of  genes  that  are  differ-
entially  expressed  between  the  conditions  with  a  stat-
istical  confidence  (p＜0.05)  (Dhanasekaran et al.,  2001). 
That  is,  the  conventional  method  may  not  be  sufficient 
to  narrow  down  the  target  pathways  and  genes  for  dis-
criminating  disease  states,  because  only  a  few  sig-
nificantly  dysregulated  candidates  genes  can  be  studied 
in  detail  at  any  given  moment.  Moreover,  most  proteins 
are  known  to  mediate  their  functions  within  regulated 
complex  networks  or  pathways  of  interconnected  mac-
romolecules  by  forming  dynamic  topological  interac-
tomes.  Additionally,  genes  that  are  not  significantly  al-
tered  may  play  a  critical  role  with  other  significantly 
dysregulated  components  in  their  biological  pathways. 
Therefore,  a  systems  biology  approach  that  can  identify 
pathways  with  these  proteins  would  significantly  im-
prove  the  ability  to  find  disease-associated  genes  from 
micorarray  datasets.  This  also  would  be  useful  in  under-
standing  the  relationship  between  pathways  and  various 
phenotypes.
    There  has  been  a  tremendous  increase  in  information 
for  constructing  large-scale  protein-protein  interaction 
networks  from  public  interactome  databases,  such  as 
HPRD  (Peri et al.,  2004).  A  number  of  approaches  have 
been  demonstrated  for  identifying  subnetworks  of  pro-
tein-protein  interactions,  based  on  coherent  expression 
patterns  of  their  genes  (Chen  and  Yuan,  2006;  Chuang 
et al.,  2007).  There  also  is  a  study  that  has  identified 
candidate  genes  that  are  related  to  certain  diseases 
based  only  on  the  topological  features  of  the  network  of 
disease-related  protein-protein  interactions  (Hwang  et 
al.,  2008).  Recently,  several  methods  for  integrating  mi-
croarray  data  with  metabolic  pathways  have  been  pre-

sented  (Setlur et al.,  2007;  Grosu et al.,  2008).  None  of 
these  approaches  has  mapped  transcriptional  changes 
in  both  metabolic  pathways  and  protein-protein 
interactions.  Moreover,  protein-protein  interaction  net-
works  have  very  complex  topological  characteristics  that 
sometimes  impose  difficulties  in  interpretation.  There-
fore,  it  will  be  convenient  for  the  interpretation  if  the 
functional  modules  that  have  significantly  perturbed 
genes  are  first  identified  to  construct  a  subnetwork  of 
protein-protein  interactions  in  each  functional  module.  It 
is  believed  that  these  subnetworks  of  protein-protein  in-
teractions  in  each  functional  module  will  provide  greater 
interpretability  than  the  genome-wide  network  of  pro-
tein-protein  interactions.  Based  on  these  points  of  view, 
we  applied  3  steps  of  microarray  data  analysis.  First, 
differentially  expressed  genes  were  selected  using  the 
standard  t  test.  Second,  significantly  perturbed  metabol-
ic  pathways  were  selected  based  on  those  differentially 
expressed  genes.  A  test  for  the  statistical  significance  of 
the  selected  pathways  also  is  presented  in  this  study. 
Third,  subnetworks  of  protein-protein  interactions  in 
those  perturbed  metabolic  pathways  were  constructed 
for  further  interpretation  of  pathways  in  detail.
    Breast  cancer  is  one  of  many  complex  progressive 
diseases.  Due  to  its  polygenic  nature,  it  is  believed  that 
breast  cancer  is  caused  not  by  single  genes  but  rather 
by  perturbations  of  multiple  genes  and  their  complex  in-
teractions,  which  contribute  to  the  wide  aspects  of  dis-
ease  phenotypes.  Therefore,  we  apply  the  strategy  of 
microarray  analysis  using  the  “score  of  perturbation”  to 
identify  significantly  perturbed  pathways.  To  this  end, 
we  identified  significantly  perturbed  pathways  in  breast 
cancer  tissues,  thereby  providing  interesting  pathways 
that  putatively  play  roles  in  the  progression  of  breast 
cancer.  Furthermore,  we  constructed  a  subnetwork  of 
protein-protein  interactions  in  these  significantly  per-
turbed  pathways  for  further  interpretation  of  pathways  in 
detail.

Methods

We  used  the  dataset  from  Turashvili et al.  (2007),  which 
consists  of  2  types  of  breast  cancer  tissues;  i.e,  invasive 
lobular  and  ductal  carcinomas.  This  dataset  includes  a 
total  of  30  samples  that  consist  of  normal  ductal  cells 
from  10  patients,  normal  lobular  cells  from  10  patients, 
invasive  ductal  carcinoma  cells  from  5  patients,  and  in-
vasive  lobular  carcinoma  cells  from  5  patients,  which 
were  microdissected  from  cryosections  of  10  mastec-
tomy  specimens  from  postmenopausal  patients.  In  this 
dataset,  50  nanograms  of  total  RNA  was  amplified  and 
labeled  by  PCR  and  in  vitro  transcription,  and  samples 
were  analyzed  using  Affymetrix  U133  Plus  2.0  Arrays.

Pathways  from  KEGG  (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/path-
way.html)  databases  were  used  as  pathway  references 
for  analysis. 
    The  basic  idea  of  our  approach  is  to  identify  per-
turbed  pathways  that  have  relatively  large  amounts  of 
overexpressed  or  underexpressed  genes.  To  begin,  a  p 
value  that  is  calculated  from  the  standard  t  test  is  as-
signed  to  every  gene  in  each  pathway,  and  the  number 
of  significantly  perturbed  genes  (p＜0.01)  is  counted  in 
each  pathway.  Note  that  the  t  test  for  each  gene  is 
conducted  by  comparing  2  mean  values  of  gene  ex-
pression  between  20  samples  of  normal  breast  cancer 
cells  and  10  samples  of  invasive  cancer  cells.  The  score 
of  perturbation  for  each  pathway  is  assigned  with  the 
probability  that  we  can,  by  chance,  expect  at  least  the 
same  number  of  significantly  perturbed  genes  in  each 
pathway,  given  the  number  of  significantly  perturbed 
genes  in  the  background  set  of  genes.  This  probability 
is  calculated  using  the  cumulative  hypergeometric  dis-
tribution  as  follows:

    where n  is  the  number  of  genes  in  each  pathway, N

of  significantly  perturbed  genes  in  each  pathway,  and r 
is  the  number  of  significantly  perturbed  genes  in  whole 
pathways.  The  pathways  that  have  p＜0.01  are  selected 
as  significantly  perturbed  genes 
in  breast  cancer 
tissues.

Results  and  Discussion

To  explore  perturbed  pathways  in  breast  cancer  tissues, 
we  analyzed  the  microarray  dataset  from  Turashvilli  et 
al.  (2007),  which  was  downloaded  from  the  NCBI  GEO 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)  database.  The  dataset 
was  standardized  such  that  each  sample  array  has  a 
mean  of  0  and  a  standard  deviation  of  1.  The  dataset 
contains  samples  of  2  breast  cancer  tissues  and  their 
corresponding  normal  cells.  The  standard  t  test  was 
used  to  score  genes  for  overexpression  or  under-
expression  in  breast  cancer  tissues  in  comparison  with 
their  normal  tissues.  The  list  of  significantly  perturbed 
genes  (p＜0.01)  was  classified  into  known  biological 
pathways  to  select  target  pathways  that  are  perturbed 
in  breast  cancer  tissues,  as  described  in  Methods.  As  a 
result,  it  was  found  that  36  pathways  were  significantly 
perturbed,  based  on  the  score  of  perturbation  (p＜0.01) 
in  breast  cancer  tissues  (see  Supplementary  Table  S1).

including  Cell  Junctions  (Fig.  1),  the  ECM-receptor  inter-
action  pathway  (Fig.  2),  the  Focal  Adhesion  pathway 
(Fig.  3),  and  the  p53  signaling  pathway,  which  have 
been  implicated  to  play  a  role  in  the  progression  of 
breast  cancers  (Behmoaram  et al.,  2008;  Fata  et al., 
2004;  Lin  et al.,  2000;  Ryan  et al.,  2000).  It  is  well 
known  that  most  cancers  lack  active  tumor  suppressor 
p53,  which  inhibits  cell  growth  through  activation  of  cell 
cycle  arrest  and  apoptosis  and  that  the  activation  of 
NFKB1  is  induced  by  p53  (Ryan  et al.,  2000).
    There  are  significant  amounts  of  evidence  that  the 
ECM-receptor  pathway  is  related  to  the  progression  of 

breast  cancer.  For  instance,  Fata et al.  (2004)  reviewed 
considerable  research  that  indicated  that  mammary 
gland  branching  morphogenesis  is  dependent,  in  part, 
on  the  ECM;  ECM-receptors,  such  as  integrins  and  oth-
er  ECM  receptors;  and  ECM-degrading  enzymes,  includ-
ing  matrix  metalloproteinases  (MMPs)  and  their  in-
hibitors,  tissue  inhibitors  of  metalloproteinases  (TIMPs). 
They  also  provided  some  evidence  that  these  ECM 
processes  affect  1  or  more  of  the  following  processes: 
cell  survival,  polarity,  proliferation,  differentiation,  adhe-
sion,  and  migration.
    It  is  well  known  that  breast  carcinoma  most  often  is

associated  with  an  extensive  ‘stromal  reaction’,  termed 
desmoplasia,  in  which  excess  collagen  is  deposited 
(Fata et al.,  2004).  It  also  has  been  shown  that  aberra-
tions  in  the  integrity,  deposition,  and  composition  of  the 
ECM  often  are  associated  with  breast  cancer  (Lochter 
and  Bissell,  1995;  Petersen  et al.,  2001).
    In  addition,  upregulation  of  expression  of  the  fibrillar 

collagen  gene  is  an  indicator  of  the  metastatic  pheno-
type  (van't  Veer et al.,  2002;  van  de  Vijver et al.,  2002; 
Wang et al.,  2002).  The  ECM  and  its  receptors  that  at-
tenuate  or  augment  signaling  regulate  branching  mor-
phogenesis  in  a  process  that  may  be  considered  as 
controlled  invasion.  For  instance,  it  has  been  shown  that 
increased  collagen  type  I  upregulates  activated  MMP  2

△ corresponds  to  significantly  overexpressed  genes  and  ▽ to  significantly  underexpressed  genes.  Note  that Path1
represents  the  Cell Junctions  pathway,  Path2  is  the  ECM-receptor interactions  pathway,  and  Path3  is  the  Focal 
Adhesion  pathway.  It  is  noteworthy  that  there  are  several  genes  that  are  involved  in  more  than  1  pathway,  allowing 
crosstalk  between  pathways.

in  human  metastatic  breast  cancer  cells  (Thompson  et 
al.,  1994).  Other  collagens,  such  as  types  III,  V,  and  VII, 
also  are  altered  with  regard  to  expression  and  deposi-
tion  in  breast  cancer  (Barsky et al.,  1982;  Fukuda et al., 
2000;  Lagace et al.,  1985;  Wetzels et al.,  1991),  trigger-
ing  signals  that  lead  to  the  loss  of  structure  and  func-
tion  in  breast.
    There  also  are  several  indications  that  the  focal  adhe-
sion  pathway  is  related  to  the  progression  of  breast 
cancer.  For  instance,  Lin et al.  (2000)  reported  a  direct 
effect  of  progesterone  in  inducing  the  spread  and  adhe-
sion  of  breast  cancer  cells,  with  the  conclusion  that  pro-
gesterone-induced  cell  spreading  and  focal  adhesion 
may  have  significant 
tumor 
metastasis.  In  addition,  there  is  crosstalk  between  the 
ECM-receptor  pathway  and  the  focal  adhesion  pathway, 
in  which  several  proteins  bind  to  form  ECMs  that  bind 
to  their  receptors,  triggering  signaling  cascades  within 
the  focal  adhesion  pathway  and  leading  to  cell  motility, 
cell  proliferation,  and  cell  survival  (Fig.  2,  3).
    Table  2  shows  overexpressed  and  underexpressed 
genes  in  Cell  Junctions,  the  ECM-receptor  interaction 
pathway,  and  the  Focal  Adhesion  pathway,  including 
THBS2,  PDGF,  COL1A1,  COLA2,  COL3A1,  COL5A1, 
and  COL5A2.  There  are  several  indications  that  these 
genes  are  associated  with  cancer.  For  instance,  THBS2 
has  been  shown  to  function  as  a  potent  inhibitor  of  tu-
mor  growth  and  angiogenesis  (Potikyan  et al.,  2007;

Hawighorst et al.,  2001).  PDGF  is  known  to  activate  the 
RAS/PIK3/AKT1/IKK/NFKB1  pathway,  in  which  NFKB1 
induces  putative  antiapoptotic  genes  (Romashkova  et 
al.,  1999).  Collagen  type  I  (COL1A1,  COL1A2),  type  III 
(COL3A1),  and  type  V  (COL5A1,  COL5A2)  are  implicated 
in  playing  roles  in  the  progression  of  metastatic  breast 
cancer  (Barsky et al.,  1982;  Fukuda et al.,  2000;  Lagace 
et al.,  1985;  Thompson  et al.,  1994;  Wetzels  et al., 
1991).
    Based  on  the  selected  perturbed  pathways,  we  com-
bined  selected  metabolic  pathways  with  protein-protein 
interaction  information  by  constructing  a  subnetwork  of 
protein-protein  interactions  (e.g.,  Fig.  4).  To  contruct  a 
subnetwork  of  protein-protein  interactions  for  each  path-
way,  information  on  protein-protein  interactions  was  ex-
tracted  from  the  Human  Protein  Reference  Database 
(HPRD)  (Peri  et al.,  2004).  Fig.  4  shows  that  protein 
complexes  can  be  identified  based  on  the  definitions  in 
individual  metabolic  pathways,  in  which  the  protein-pro-
tein  interactions  can  be  categorized  into  intra-  or  in-
ter-pathway  interactions.  It  also  is  possible  to  identify 
significantly  perturbed  proteins  within  the  protein  com-
plexes  for  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  pathways.
    Based  on  perturbation  score,  we  present  36  sig-
nificantly  perturbed  pathways,  instead  of  collecting  a 
large  amount  of  significantly  dysregulated  individual 
genes.  The  selected  pathways  are  then  considered  to 
be  dysregulated  functional  modules  that  putatively  con-

represent  the  protein  complexes  of  IF, Actin, ITGB4, ITGA6,  and  BP180,  respectively  (see  Fig.  1).  (B)  Subnetwork  of  pro-
tein-protein  interactions  in  both  the  ECM-receptor Interaction  and  Focal Adhesion  pathways.  The  rectangular  boxes  with 
dashed  lines  represent  the  protein  complexes  of  ECM, ITGA,  and  ITGB,  respectively  (see  Fig.  3).  Note  that  3  protein  com-
plexes  in  (B)  can  be  subdivided  into  smaller  protein  complexes  based  on  the  definition  of  the  ECM-receptor  pathway  (Fig.
2).  Note  also  that  grey-colored  nodes  represent  significantly  perturbed  genes  (p＜0.01)  in  breast  cancer  tissues.

tribute  to  the  progression  of  disease.  The  result  of  this 
study  suggests  that  the  strategy  of  microarray  analysis, 
using  the  score  of  perturbation,  selects  several  interest-
ing  perturbed  pathways  that  are  implicated  in  the  pro-
gression  of  breast  cancer.  It  also  was  found  that  these 
selected  pathways  include  several  known  breast  can-
cer-related  genes.  Therefore,  based  on  the  selected 
pathways,  this  study  sets  the  stage  for  further  inves-
tigation  of  the  basic  mechanisms  that  serve  as  a  basis 
for  discriminating  different  breast  cancer  types  to  find 
new  therapeutic  drug  targets.
