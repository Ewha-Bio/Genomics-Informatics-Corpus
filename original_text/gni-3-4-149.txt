Albstract 
Asthma is an inflammatory airways disease characterized 
by bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airways obstruction, 
which results from a complex interaction of genetic and 
environmental  factors.  lnterleukin (IL)-13  and  IL-4  are 
important  in  lgE  synthesis  and  allergic  inflammation, 
therefore genes encoding IL -13 and IL-4 are candidates 
for  predisposition  to  asthma.  In  the  present  study,  we 
screened single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-13 
and IL-4 and examined whether they are risk factors for 
asthma.  We  resequenced  all  exons  and  the  promoter 
region  in  12  asthma  patients  and  12  normal  controls, 
and  identified  18  SNPs  including  2  novel  SNPs.  The 
linkage  disequilibrium(LD)  pattern  was  evaluated  with 
16 common SNPs, and haplotypes were also estimated 
within  the  block.  Although  IL-13 and  IL-4 are  localized 
within  27  kb  on  chromosome  5q31  and  share  many 
biological  profiles,  this  region  was  partitioned  into  2 
blocks.  One SNP and three SNPs were determined as 
haplotype-taggingSNPs (htSNPs) within  IL-13 and  IL-4 
haplotype-block, respectively. No significant associations 
were observed between any of the SNPs or haplotypes 
and development of asthma in  small number of Korean 
subjects. However, the genetic variants of IL-13 and IL-4 
would  provide  valuable  strategies  for  the  genotyping 
studies in large population.

Introduction 
Asthma is a common respiratory disease characterized 
by  intermittent  airways  obstruction  and  respiratory 
symptoms  that  are  caused  by  acute  and  chronic 
bronchial inflammation (Renauld, 2001). The development 
of asthma appears to be determined by the interaction 
between host susceptibility and a variety of environmental 
exposures (Howard et at.,  2001).  Linkage studies have 
mapped  asthma  susceptibility  genes  to  a  region  on 
chromosome 5q31  containing a cluster of proinflammatory 
cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 (Howard 
eta/.,  2001;  Mansur  eta/.,  1998).  The  IL-13  gene  is 
located 12 kb upstream of the IL -4 gene in a tail-to-head 
orientation.  Both  genes  have  been  genetically  and 
functionally  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of  asthma 
(Heinzmann  eta/.,  2000;  Noguchi  eta/.,  2001;  Walley 
and  Cookson,  1996).  These  CD4+  T-helper  type  2 
cytokines  play  crucial  role  in  the  allergic  response  by 
regulating the isotype switch of B cells from  lgM to  lgE 
synthesis (Punnonen eta/., 1994). They appear to share 
many,  but  not  all,  biological  profiles,  including  lgE 
production, CD23 and MHC class II expression, inhibition 
of  antibody-dependent  cell  mediated  cytotoxicity  with 
downregulation  of  lgG  receptor  1  (Fe 1 R I ),  and 
suppression of type  I  interferon (lzuhara and Shirakawa, 
1999;  Shirakawa  et a/.,  2000).  Although  it  has  been 
previously demonstrated  that  genetic variants  of  IL-13 
and IL-4 are associated with asthma or allergic disorders 
in  some  ethnic  groups  (Heinzmann  et at.,  2000),  real 
association with asthma in other population still remains 
to  be  elucidated.  In  this  study,  we  screened  genetic 
variants in IL -13 and IL -4, and examined their associations 
with  development  of  asthma  in  the  small  number  of 
Korean subjects. 

Materials and Methods 
Subjects 
A total  of 24 unrelated Korean  individuals consisting of 
12 asthma patients and 12 normal controls were used for 
SNP  screening.  All  patients  with  asthma  had  currently 
one  or  more  asthma  symptoms  and  the  physical 
examination  compatible  with  asthma  definition  by  the 
American  Thoracic  Society  (1987).  All  studies  were 
approved  by  the  institutional  review  board  of  Korea

Resequencing and genotyping analysis 
To  identify  common  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs)  in  IL-13  and  IL-4,  we  resequenced  the  entire 
coding  regions  and  approximately  up  to  the  -0.5  kb 
proximal  promoter  regions  in  genomic  DNA  from  24 
selected subjects. The each fragment amplified by PCR 
from genomic DNA was sequenced on both strands with 
an  ABI  Prism  3100  sequencer  (Applied  Biosystems, 
Foster City,  CA,  USA)  according to the manufacturer's 
instructions. PolyPhred program (http://droog.gs.washington. 
edu/PolyPhred.html) was used to assemble the sequences 
and identify SNPs (Nickerson et al.,  1997). In addition to 
resequencing, we also selected 10 known SNPs of each 
IL -13 and IL-4 from NCBI dbSNP database and genotyped 
for the same subjects using TaqMan assay with an ABI 
Prism  7900HT  Sequence  Detection  System  (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The ethnic comparison 
of  allele frequency was  performed  by searching JSNP 
database  (http://snp.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/)  and/or  dbSNP 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/) database. 

Statistical analysis 
Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectancy was examined 
with x2 test. Lewontin's D' was used to determine whether 
the  pairs of sites were  in  strong  linkage disequilibrium 
(LD). Haplotypes were inferred usirgthePL-EJvlalgorithm 
(http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/-junliu/plem')  (Qin  et 
al., 2002). Program SNPtagger (http://www.well. ox.ac.uk/ 
-xiayi/haplotypetindex.htrnl)  was  used  to  determine  the 
haplotype-tagging  SNPs  (htSNPs)  (Ke  and  Cardon, 
2003). The frequencies of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes 
were compared between patients and controls by Fisher's 
exact  test  or l  statistic,  as  appropriate,  using  SAS  for 
windows V8 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Statistical 
significance was inferred at a two-tailed value of P < 0.05. 

ResuHs and Discussion 
Genetic variants of IL-13 and IL-4 in the Korean 
population 
Resequencing and genotyping of IL-13 and IL-4 genomic 
DNA in 24 samples (including 12 asthma patients and 12 
normal  controls)  identified  18  SNPs,  including 2  novel 
SNPs,  in the Korean population (Fig.1 a and Table 1 ):  7 
SNPs  in  IL-13  and  11  SNPs  in  IL-4,  respectively.  As 
shown in  Table  1,  there were substantial differences of 
allele  frequencies  among  different  ethnic  groups. 

Furthermore,  some  SNPs  with  allele  frequency  up  to 
0.2 in Africans, selected from NCBI dbSNP database, 
showed  monomorphic  genotyping  data  in  Koreans: 
rs3212145,  rs2069746,  rs2069749  and  rs2069750  of 
IL-13; rs2243251, rs4986964 and rs2243286 of IL -4 (data 
not shown). These results reconfirmed that an extensive 
verification  of  public  SNPs  in  a  particular  population 
studied should be undertaken prior to their association 
studies as previously reported (Lee et al.,  2003). 

LD block structure and  haplotypes of IL-13 and 
IL-4 in the Korean population 
The  result  of  LD  analysis  of  IL-13  and  IL-4  was 
summarized in Fig.1 b.  Since  I D' I are strongly inflated 
for SNPs with  rare alleles,  high values can be obtained 
even  when  markers  are  in  fact  in  linkage  equilibrium 
(Ardlie et at.,  2002). Therefore, SNPs with frequency at 
least 5% were used for LD analysis.  Even if  IL-13 and 
IL-4 are localized within 27 kb on the proximal portion of 
chromosome 5q31  and  share  many biologic  activities, 
this region was decomposed into discrete 2 haplotype(cid:173)
blocks  in  the  Korean  population.  Complete  LD  was 
observed  between  any 2 of 10 SNPs  in  IL-4,  whereas 
there was no strong LD between the +571  C>A and the 
others  in  IL-13.  From this  result,  we could deduce that 
there might be more than one haplotype-block in IL-13. 
Halotypes  were  constructed  on 
the  basis  of  the 
genotype data using PL-EM algorithm within each block. 
Two  haplotypes,  identified  in  IL-13,  accounted  for  all 
observed  haplotype  diversity  (Fig.1 b).  Any  one  of  5 
SNPs within the IL-13 haplotype-block was determined 
as  htSNP,  because  they were completely matched.  In 
IL-4,  four  haplotypes  were  identified,  and  2  dominant 
haplotypes with frequencies over 5 % accounted for 96 
%of all haplotypes (Fig.1 b). There were 3 htSNPs, which 
capture 100% of the haplotype diversity observed within 
IL-4, as follows: htSNP1  was any one of -219 T>C, +338 
T>C,  +1354 T>C,  +4417 A>G,  +4591  C>A and  +5460 
A>G;  htSNP2 was any one of +8572G>A,  +8760 G>A 
and  +8797  A>C;  htSNP3  was  +3353  T>G.  In  case  of 
covering 2 common haplotypes, any one of 10 SNPs was 
identified as htSNP within IL-4. 

No association of IL-13 and IL-4 genetic variants 
with  asthma  in  the  small  number  of  Korean 
subjects 
For each SNP,  the genotype frequency was consistent 
with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium ( P > 0.31) and those of 
three alternative models, such as, co-dominant, dominant 
and  recessive  models,  were  not  significantly  different 
between  patients  and  controls  (P >  0.59)  (data  not
