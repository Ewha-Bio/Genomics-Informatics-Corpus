Abstract

A  few  bioinformatics  tools  have  been  used  to  find  out 
conserved  regions  as  probes.  We  have  developed  a 
system  based  on  a  heuristic  method  with  web  interfaces 
to  find  out  conserved  regions  against  microbial  geno-
mes.  The  system  runs  in  real  time  by  using  relative  en-
tropy  in  limited  narrow  regions  and  detecting  similar  re-
gions  between  pair  regions  with  local  alignment.  The 
system  could  be  useful  to  find  out  conserved  regions  as 
genome-wide  scale.

design,  probe  design

Introduction

Many  bioinformatics  tools  have  been  used  for  bio-
medical  applications,  especially  for  genome-based  re-
searches.  A  lot  of  biomedical  researches  have  focused 
on  finding  out  genetic  characteristics  related  with  dis-
eases.  Specifically  conserved  regions  among  strains, 
species  or  genus  can  be  interpreted  as  diverse  mean-
ings  depending  on  cases.  Specific  regions  among  some 
microbes  can  be  used  for  diagnostic  purpose,  especially 
when  using  microarray  chips.
    Homology  search  tools  such  as  FASTA  (Pearson, 
1990),  BLAST  (Altschul,  1998),  ClustalW  (Thompson, 
2002),  BLAT  (Kent,  2002)  are  generally  used  to  find  sim-

ilar  regions.  While  they  can  be  used  to  find  out  specific 
regions  among  a  given  genomes,  additional  processing 
should  be  done  to  manipulate  the  homology  search  re-
sults  to  extract  conserved  regions.  Since  the  most  pop-
ular  Primer3  was  released,  a  few  programs  have  been 
developed  for  primer  design  and  probe  design.  Some 
programs  such  as  PCR  Suite  (van  Baren,  2004)  and 
BatchPrimer3  (You,  2004)  provide  user-friendly  Primer3 
interfaces  including  web-based  environment.  Some  pro-
grams  have  been  developed  for  designing  very  specific 
primers  (Moro,  2009).  iCODEHOP  (Boyce,  2009)  uses 
multialignment  result  from  ClustalW.  Genomemasker 
(Andreson,  2006)  and  UniPrime  (Boutros,  2009)  treat  ge-
nome  sequences  for  primer  design.
    We  have  developed  COCAW  (Comparative  Observer 
for  Conserved  Areas  among  Whole  genomes),  which  has 
web  interfaces  for  the  input  of  multiple  genomes  and 
the  output  of  graphical  display  of  detected  conserved 
regions.

Overview  of  the  System

Fig.1  shows  the  general  algorithm  of  COCAW.  Common 
k-mer  patterns  are  detected  in  genomes  as  seed  pat-
terns  for  finding  out  the  candidates  of  conserved  pair 
regions.  To  select  comparison  regions  instead  of  com-

paring  whole  genomes,  the  information  entropy  for  each 
k-mer  is  calculated  against  whole  genomes.  After  se-
lecting  the  regions  to  be  compared  based  on  the  in-
formation  entropy,  local  alignment  is  calculated  to  de-
tect  final  conserved  pair  regions.
    Fig.  2  shows  the  main  web  interface  of  COCAW. 
Inputs  are  (a)∼(d)  including  a  reference  genome,  com-
pared  genomes,  the  comparison  range  of  the  reference 
genome,  and  tolerance  value  of  the  information  entropy 
comparison.  And  the  detected  conserved  regions  are 
displayed  at  (e)∼(f).  The  right  shot  shows  an  example 
of  the  summary  of  the  searched  result,  where  one  ge-
nome  has  a  similar  region  with  the  reference  genome 
and  no  similar  regions  are  found  between  the  reference 
genome  and  other  genomes.
    Fig.  3  shows  the  running  time  analysis  of  COCAW. 
X-axis  indicates  the  number  of  genomes  and  Y-axis  in-
dicates  the  running  time.  And  multiple  plots  for  error 
cutoffs  of  information  entropy  are  displayed.  While  the 
running  time  increases  rapidly  by  the  number  of  com-
pared  genomes,  it  is  still  very  practical  for  conserved  re-

gion  analysis  of  species  and  genus.

Discussion

COCAW  is  a  tool  for  scanning  multiple  genomes  for 
conserved  regions  and  it  could  be  useful  for  ge-
nome-wide  detection  of  the  patterns  as  probes  among 
a  group  of  genomes.  Currently  it  shows  the  detected 
conserved  regions  with  a  little  graphical  interface,  and  it 
will  be  upgraded  for  more  practical  and  informational  in-
terface  especially  for  multiple  genome  processing.
    COCAW  finds  out  conserved  regions  among  multiple 
genomes.  As  a  group-specific  pattern  is  an  exclusively 
conserved  region,  it  is  not  only  conserved  in  the  group 
but  also  should  not  be  in  other  genomes.  So  for  detect-
ing  very  strict  group  specific  patterns,  more  complicated 
and  time-consuming  processes  are  additionally  required.   
More  practical  algorithms  should  be  developed  for  mas-
sive  number  of  genomes  with  practical  user  interfaces 
for  diverse  applications.
