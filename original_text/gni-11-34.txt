This study evaluated the effects of somatic mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease progression 
and tried to verify the two-hit theory in cancer pathogenesis. To address this issue, SNP analysis was performed using the 
UCSC hg19 program in 10 acute myeloid leukemia patients (samples, G1 to G10), and somatic mutations were identified in 
the same tumor sample using SomaticSniper and VarScan2. SNPs in KRAS were detected in 4 out of 10 different individuals, 
and those of DNMT3A were detected in 5 of the same patient cohort. In 2 patients, both KRAS and DNMT3A were detected 
simultaneously. A somatic mutation in IDH2 was detected in these 2 patients. One of the patients had an additional mutation 
in FLT3, while the other patient had an NPM1 mutation. The patient with an FLT3 mutation relapsed shortly after attaining 
remission, while the other patient with the NPM1 mutation did not suffer a relapse. Our results indicate that SNPs with 
additional somatic mutations affect the prognosis of AML.

Introduction

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common type 
of leukemia among hematologic malignancies. This disease 
is a clonal hematopoietic disease that is caused by either 
inherited or acquired genetic mutations. AML is known to be 
a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease [1]. In 
order  to  cure  this  disease,  cytosine-arabinoside  (Ara-C)- 
based  chemotherapy  is  widely  used.  Two  thirds  of  AML 
patients who receive Ara-C based chemotherapy regimen, 
will achieve complete remission (CR). However, more than 
50%  of  patients  suffer  a  relapse  after  attaining  CR  [2]. 
Eventually,  a  great  majority  of  AML  patients  die  from 
progressive disease after relapse by various genetic changes 
that will endow tumor cells with resistance against most 

commonly  used  anticancer  agents.  Therefore,  it  is  prere-
quisite  to  identify  prognostic  markers  that  will  help  in 
deciding the suitable treatment modalities. A lot of studies 
have focused on finding somatic mutations in cancer cells by 
whole-exome  sequencing  (WES).  However,  these  studies 
did  not  fully  explain  the  mechanisms  of  how  disease 
relapses. 

In the initial development of cancer in humans, Knudson’s 
two-hit hypothesis has provided important insights into the 
pathogenesis  of  tumors  in  autosomal  dominant  tumor 
predisposition syndromes [3]. With an analogy, we focused 
on  the  additional  genetic  changes  that  will  predispose 
susceptible  individuals  with  a  pre-existing  genetic  abnor-
mality to develop leukemia. To address this issue, germline 
single  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP)  analysis  was  per-

formed using the UCSC hg19 program in 10 AML patients 
(samples,  G1  to  G10),  and  somatic  mutations  were 
identified in the same tumor sample using SomaticSniper 
and VarScan2. Our results suggest that SNPs with additional 
somatic mutations may directly affect the prognosis of AML 
and emphasize the need to validate in a larger patient cohort.

Methods
DNA sample preparation (normal and tumor 
samples)

Genomic  DNA  samples  were  prepared  for  WES.  They 
were freshly obtained from AML patients’ bone marrow at 
initial  diagnosis.  Subsequent  bone  marrow  samples  were 
aspirated  if  necessary  according  the  disease  status  of  the 
patients.  AML  blast  tumor  cells  were  isolated  from  bone 
marrow  of  each  patient  using  Ficoll  gradient  separation. 
Matching patients’ saliva samples were collected as germline 
controls. Each tumor and control DNA was extracted via 
standard protocols of DNA purification. DNA samples for 
validation were obtained from our frozen stock as needed.

Whole-exome sequencing

We  prepared  and  sequenced  exomes  using  the  Solexa 
sequencing technology platform (HiSeq2000; Illumina, San 
Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
We  randomly  sheared  3μg  of  genomic  DNA  using  the 
Covaris System to generate 150-bp inserts. The fragmented 
DNA  was  end-repaired  using  T4  DNA  polymerase  and 
Klenow polymerase, and Illumina paired-end adaptor oligo-
nucleotides were ligated to the sticky ends. We analyzed the 
ligation mixture by electrophoresis on an agarose gel and 
sliced and purified fragments of 200‒250 bp. The purified 
DNA library was hybridized with the SureSelect Human All 
Exons probes set (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to capture 
50  Mb  of  targeted  exons  following  the  manufacturer’s 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

instruction. We prepared the HiSeq2000 paired-end flowcell 
with the manufacturer’s protocol using the captured exome 
library. Clusters of PCR colonies were then sequenced on the 
HiSeq2000 platform using recommended protocols from the 
manufacturer.

Read mapping and alignment and variant analysis

We recently developed an in-house analysis pipeline for 
cancer  genome  sequencing  data.  This  pipeline  essentially 
includes  1)  mapping  and  alignment,  2)  discovery  of  se-
quence  nucleotide  variations  (SNVs)  and  insertions  and 
deletions (indels), and 3) filtering and annotation of SNVs 
and indels. Briefly, once the raw sequence data were created, 
the output short reads were aligned to a reference genome 
(NCBI  human  genome  assembly  build  36)  using  UCSC 
hg19. Each alignment was assigned a mapping quality score 
by UCSC hg19, which is the Phred-scaled probability that 
the  alignment  is  incorrect.  The  PCR  duplicates  were 
detected  and  removed  by  SAMTOOLS  (http://samtools. 
sourceforge.net/). After alignment, we used GATK v1.4 to 
call  SNVs  for  each  chromosomal  position.  Filtering  and 
annotation  of  SNVs  and  indels  were  performed  using 
ANNOVAR (http://www.openbioinformatics.org/annovar/). 
We defined somatic mutation SNVs as those detected by 
both SomaticSniper and VarScan2 with a somatic p-value < 
0.05. We also set a minimum coverage of 5 in both normal 
and tumor samples. Conclusively, final somatic mutations 
were selected using the in-house filter.

Results and Discussion

Germline  SNP  analysis  was  done  to  detect  germline 
heterozygous mutations that are carried by AML patients. To 
address  this issue,  germline SNP analysis was performed 
using the UCSC hg19 program in 10 AML patients (samples 
G1  to  G10)  (Table  1).  We  chose  18  major  genes  (TET2,

IDH2) to be analyzed in 10 samples (Table 2). Among these 
18 genes, KRAS and DNMT3A seemed to play a critical role in 
the progression of AML, associated with the chemotherapy 
response. KRAS is a protein product of the normal KRAS 
gene, which performs an essential function in normal tissue 
signaling, and the mutation of a KRAS gene is an essential 
step in the development of many cancers [4]. DNMT3A is a 
key component of the epigenetic regulation of genes, as it 

catalyzes  the  addition  of  methyl  groups  to  the  cytosine 
residue of CpG dinucleotides [5]. However, variations only 
in  KRAS  and  DNMT3A  are  not  enough  to  explain  the 
mechanism of AML progression, since additional somatic 
changes exist in AML patients.

SNPs  of  KRAS  were  detected  in  4  different  individuals 
(G2, G6, G7, and G8), as shown in Table 1, while those of 
DNMT3A were detected in 5 individuals (G3, G4, G6, G8, 
and G10) among 10 AML patients (Table 1). Patients G6 and 
G8  showed  SNPs  in  both  KRAS  and  DNMT3A.  We  then

searched for somatic mutations of each individual in order to 
prove the ‘two-hit’ theory. Table 3 shows the results of the 
somatic mutation analysis. SNPs of KRAS and DNMT3A were 
detected in both samples G6 and G8 (Table 3). However, they 
had different clinical courses after the first induction. They 
both attained a CR after the first induction; however, G6 
relapsed within 390 days after attaining remission, while G8 
did not relapse for 402 days. We suggested that an additional 
somatic  mutation  may  have  affected  the  clinical  courses 
above. A somatic mutation in IDH2 was identified in both G6 
and G8, while that of FLT3 and NPM1 was detected in G6 and 
G8, respectively. FLT3 mutation is known as a bad prognostic 
factor in AML [6]. NPM1 mutation, on the other hand, is 
usually  known  as  a  good  prognostic  factor  in  AML  [7]. 
Therefore,  we  could  speculate  that  SNPs  (KRAS  and 
DNMT3A)  with  additional  somatic  mutations  (FLT3  and 
NPM1) affect the prognosis of AML differentially. 

In addition, G2 and G7 shared the same SNPs in KRAS but 
their clinical courses showed a striking difference (Table 4). 
G7 had an additional germline SNP in KIT. This patient never 
attained CR despite intensive chemotherapy. As we searched 
further for somatic mutations in G7, a somatic mutation in 
TET2 was detected as a second hit. On the other hand, an 
NPM1 mutation was observed in G2, showing a divergent 
outcome compared with G7. G2 attained CR after the first 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  1,  2013

induction of chemotherapy and did not relapse. 

We observed a divergent outcome in patients having the 
same SNPs but with different somatic mutations as a second 
hit. Somatic mutations that were differentially detected at 
the time of diagnosis strongly suggest clinical implications 
and warrant future study in a larger cohort to enhance our 
understanding of the mechanisms of disease progression in 
AML.
