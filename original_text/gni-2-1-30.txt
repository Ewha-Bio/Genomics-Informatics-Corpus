Abstract 

To  investigate the  XIST  gene  expression  and  its  effect 
in  a  Klinefelter's  patient,  we  used  Klinefelter's  syndrome 
(XXY)  patient  with  azoospermia  and  also  used  a  normal 
male  (XY)  and  a  normal  female  (XX)  as  the control.  We 
were  performed  cytogenetic  analysis,  Y chromosomal 
microdeletion  assay (Yq),  semi-quantitative  RT -PCR,  and 
the  Northern  blot  for  Klinefelter's  syndrome  (KS)  patient, 
a  female  and  a  male  control.  We  extracted  total  RNA 
from  the  KS  patient,  and  from  the  normal  cells  of  the 
female  and  male  control  subjects  using  the  RNA  prep 
kit  (Qiagen).  eDNA  microarray contained  218  human  X 
chromosome-specific  genes  was  fabricated.  Each  total 
RNA  was  reverse transcribed  to the first  strand  eDNA 
and  was  labeled  with  Cy-3 and Cy-5 fluorescein.  The 
microarray was  scanned  by ScanArray 4000XL system. 
XIST  transcripts were  detected from  the Klinefelters  patient 
and  the  female  by RT -PCR and  Northern  blot  analysis, 
but  not  from  the  normal  male.  In  the  eDNA  microarray 
experiment,  we  found  24  genes  and  14 genes  are  highly 
expressed  in  KS  more  than  the  normal  male  and  females, 
respectively.  We  concluded  that  highly expressed  genes 
in  KS  may  be  a  resulted  of  the  abnormal  X inactivation 
mechanism.

Introduction 
X-chromosome  inactivation  (XCI)  is  initiated  from  the 
X-inactivation center (Xic)  in  female.  X inactivation 
normally occurs  ~andomly, with  an  equal  probability of 
either the  paternally  (Xp)  or  maternally (Xm)  inherited 
X being  inactivated  (Eichhorn  et at.,  1990).  Theoretically, 
the  observation  of  a single active  X chromosome  in  cases 
of  X-chromosome aneuploidy suggests  that  one X 
chromosome  is  always chosen  to  be active  rather  than 
different  numbers  of X chromosomes  being  chosen  to 
be  inactive.  For  example,  X-chromosome anueploidy  like 
nXY  (n)2)  consists  of  X+ X- Y and  X+  X- X- Y (X+, 
active X chromosome;  X-,  inactive X chromosome;  Y, 
Y  chromosome)  to  be  active. 

Klinefelter's  syndrome (KS)  is  defined  by  male  with 
one y  chromosome  and  at  least  two  X chromosome. 
KS  is  found  in  approximately 1 of  500  men.  Clinical  features 
include small  testes  ((10ml),  disproportionately  long  arms, 
legs,  gynecomastia  (breast  developmen_t},  elevated 
gonadotrophin  levels,  and  azoospermia.

in  humans 

To  obtain  the  X chromosome  expression  profile  in 
subjects  with  KS,  experiments  for  X  chromosome 
inactivation  were  performed.  The  human  X chromosome 
genes were  used  as  a  model  for  the  eDNA  microarray, 
which  mainly  consisted  of  218  genes on  X chromosome. 
For  detection  of  X-chromosome  inactivation  in  a  KS 
patient,  the expression  of  XIST  in  a  normal  male  (XY), 
a normal  female  (XX},  and  KS  patient  (XXY}  were  checked. 
The  XIST 
large 
non-protein-coding transcript  that  coats  the  inactive X 
chromosome  (Brockdorff  et at.,  1992;  Brown  et at.,  1992}. 
A  previous  study  reported 
isolation  and 
characterization  of  the  novel  gene,  XIST,  which  was 
expressed  from  Xi  but  not  from  Xa  chromosomes.  This 
discovery  represents  a candidate  for  a gene that  is  either 
involved  in  or  strongly  influenced  by X inactivation  (Brown 
et at.,  1991).  The  XIST  expression  can  indicate a  possib~e 
role  of  the X inactivation for  normal  spermatogenesis 
(Salida  et at.,  1992).  We  estimated  the  state  of  the  X 
chromosome  inactivation to  determine  whether  or  not 
the XIST  gene can  be expressed  in  a  normal  male,  a 
normal  female,  and  a  KS  patient.

Materials  and  Methods 

Patients  and  Controls 

A  normal  male  and  female,  and  a  Klinefelters  syndrome 
with  azoospermia  and  47  XXY,  at  the  CHA  General 
Hospital,  College  of  Medicine,  Pochon  CHA University 
(Seoul,  Korea),  gave  informed  consent  for  the  use  of 
their  blood. 

Cytogenetic and Y Chromosome  Microdeletion Assay 
Cytogenetic  analysis  was  performed  on  metaphase 
spreads  of  cultured  lymphocytes.  For  Yq  deletion  studies, 
DNA was  extracted  from  the  peripheral  blood  and 
amplified  by a  multi-PCR  method  with  primers  to  13  loci 
on  the  Y  chromosome,  including  one  SRY  and  12 
sequence-tagged  sites  (STSs)  (AZF-a  region:  sY84, 
sY86;  AZF-b  region:  sY  134,  sY  138,  MK5;  AZF-c  region: 
sY  152,  sY  147,  sY  254,  sY  255,  SPGY1,  sY  269,  sY  158) 
(Simoni,  2001;  Simoni  et al.,  1999). 

Cell  and  Its  culture  condition 
We  obtained  EBV-Iymphoblstoid  cell  lines  from  a  normal 
male,  female  and  Klinefelters  patient.  Cells  were  grown 
in  a  C02  incubator  (37"C,  5%  C02)  in  RPMI  1640  medium 
(Gibco  BRL,  Cergy  Pontoise,  France)  supplemented  with 
10%  heat-inactivated  fetal  bovine  serum  (Gibco  BRL, 
Cergy  Pontoise,  France),  1%  L-Giutamine  and  1% 
Antibiotic-antimicotic. 

RNA  Extraction  and  DNAse  treatment 

Total  RNA  lymphoblastoid  cell  from  normal  (male  and 
female)  and  KS  patient  isolated  by  using  the  Qiagen 
RNeasy  kit  according  to  the  recommendation  of  the 
manufacturer  protocol  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA).  Gel 
electrophoresis  and  spectrophotometric  reading 
assessed  RNA  quality.  RNA  preparation  was  treated  for 
10  min  at  37C  with  RNAse-free  DNAse  I (Roche  Boehringer 
Mannhein,  Germany)  and  stored  at  -8o·c. 

Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcription  Polymerase 
Chain  Reaction  (RT -PCR) 

RT -PCR for  XIST expression  performed  using  QIAGEN 
OneStep  RT -PCR  Kit  (Qiagen,  Valencia,  CA)  with  PCR 
DNA Thermal  Cycler  (Perkin  Elmer,  Norwalk,  CT). 
First-strand  eDNA was  synthesized  from  total  RNA  at 
5o·c for  30  min,  activated  HotStarTaq  DNA  Polymerase 
by  heating  at  95•c  tor  15  min.  PCRs  of  first-strand  eDNA 
were  performed  under conditions  of  40s  at  94·c.  40s 
at  56·c  and  1 min  at  72·c  each  cycle.  40  cycles  were 
done,  followed  by extension  for  10  min  at  72·c.  The  XIST 

expression  detected  using  the  following  primer  pairs: 
XIST  1,  5'--GAA  GTC  TCA AGG  CTT  GAG  TTA GAA G-3'; 
XIST  3a,  5'-ACA TTT TIC TCT  AGA  GAG  CCT  GGC-3'; 
XIST  3b,  5'-GCC  AGG  CTC  TCT  AGA  GAA AAA TGT -3'; 
XIST  5,  5'-TGT CTG  CAT AAA AGC  AGA TT-3';  Pyruvate 
dehydrogenase  (PDH)  1,  5'-GGA ATG  GAT  GAG  GAC 
CTG  GA-3';  Pyruvate  dehydrogenase (PDH)  2,  5'-CTI 
CCA CAG  CCC  TCG  ACT  AA-3'  (Brown  et al.,  1991). 
These  primers  can  generate 705bp (XIST 1 and  3a),  380bp 
and  240bp (XIST  3b  and  5)  and  105bp (PDH1  and  PDH2) 
PCR  fragment,  respectively.  The  RT -PCR products were 
subjected  to  electrophoresis  on  a  1%  agarose  gel. 

Northern  Blot  Analysis 
Total  RNA  (20  ug)  was  electrophoresed  on  1.25  % agarose 
gel  containing  37%  formaldehyde  and  20X MOPS  for  5hr 
at  150V,  and  then  transferred  to  positively charged  nylon. 
Then,  blots were  hybridized  with  32P-Iabeled  DNA 
fragment  from  705  bp  PCR  product  using  XIST  primer 
1 and  3a  as a  probe  for  19.3  kb XIST  RNA.  The  probe 
of  Human  GAPDH  (1.28  kb)  was  used  for  northern  blot 
analysis  as  a  control. 

Array  Fabrication 
218  eDNA clones  of  human  eDNA  collection  were  kindly 
provided  from  the  Center for  Functional  analysis  of  Human 
Genome,  Korea.  Clone  inserts were  PCR-amplified  from 
culture  and  purified  by  PCR  Cleanup  Kit  (Millipore, 
Billerica,  Mass.,  USA).  PCR  from  plasmid  miniprep  DNA 
was  carried  out  for  96  well  microtiter  plates.  PCR  products 
were  dissolved  for  spotting  on  slide  by 50%  DMSO,  and 
then  spotted  onto  Corning  GAPS  II  slides  (Corning),  coated 
with  an  amino-silane  surface  chemistry. 

Probe  Preparation  and  Hybridization  to  eDNA 
microarray 
Ribonucleic  acid  (40  ug)  was  reversed  transcribed  using 
Superscript  II  RT  kit  (Gibco,  Grand  Island,  USA)  with  1 
mM  Cy3  and  Cy5  labeled  dUTP  (NEN).  To  purify  labeled 
cDNAs  from  unincorporated  nucleotides,  probes  were 
filtered  through  Ethanol  preparation.  The  human  eDNA 
microarray (spotted  by  Digital  Genomics)  that  contained 
218  human  genes  were  prehybridized  in  10  mg/ml  BSA, 
5X  SSC,  0.1%  SDS  and  25%  formamide  for  45  min  at 
58·c.  washed  by dipping  five  times  in  Milli_Q_water,  and 
dried  the  slide  by  centrifuge  at  650  rpm  at  room 
temperature for  5 min.  Fluorescent eDNA  probes were 
dried  after  Ethanol  preparation  and  resuspended  in  12 
ml  hybridization  buffer  (25%  formamide,  5x sse,  0.1% 
SDS).  After  combination  of  Cy3  and  Cy5  labeled,  we 
added  0.025-0.1  mg/ml  Cot-1  DNA and  0.5  mg/ml  poly

A  to samples,  all  was  denatured  at  95•c  for  5  min.  The 
probes  were  applied  to a  prehybridized  array,  covered 
with  a  22  X 22  mm  glass coverslip  (Corning),  and  placed 
in  a  humidified  hybridization  chamber.  After  hybridization, 
the slide was  washed  for  5  min  with  2X  SSC/ 0.1%  SDS 
at  room  temperature,  and  washed  again  for  10  min  with 
0.1X  SSC/0.1%  SDS  at  room  temperature,  and  finally 
washed  four  times  for  1 min  with  0.1X sse  with  continuous 
agitation.

Analysis  of  Gene  Expression 

The  slide  was  dried  by centrifugation,  scanned  by 
ScanArray 4000XL system  and  analyzed  with  GeneSight 
3.2  (BioDiscovery,  USA).  The  intensity of  each  spots  were 
expressed  numerically with  autoalign  method  in  program, 
the  data  were  normalized  with  global  normalization 
method  on  GeneSight  (BioDiscovery,  USA).  The  data 
generated  by  image  processing  were  imported  into 
GeneSpring  (version  6  Silicon  Genetics,  Redwood,  CA) 
to classify  by category.  The  ratio  threshold  was set  at 
2.0  in  our  study.  Only those  genes,  which  showed  as 
increase  or  decrease  of  2.0  fold  or  greater,  were 
considered  as  differentially  expressed.

Results 

The  identification of X  inactivation  in a  normal  male 
and  female,  and  KS  patient  by  semi-quantitative 
RT -PCR  and  northern  blot  analysis 

To  identify whether  KS  has an  inactive X chromosome 
or  not,  the  expression  of  XIST  (X-inactivation  specific 
transcript)  was analyzed  from  a  normal  male  (46,  '6' ), 
a  normal  female  (46,  Sf.),  and  a  KS  patient  (47,  XXY) 
by semi-quantitative  RT -PCR (Fig.  1a).  The  analysis 
showed  that  XIST  transcripts  can  be detected  in  all  blood 
samples  from  a  normal  female  (46,  Sf.)  and  a  KS  patient 
(47,  XXY)  with  two  X chromosomes.  On  the  other  hand, 
the  expression  of  XIST  transcripts  in  a  normal  male  (46, 
'6')  was  negative.  All  samples  were  positive for  pyruvate 
dehydrogenase  (PDH)  transcripts  according  to the 
semi-quantitative  RT -PCR.  After  semi-quantitative 
RT -PCR,  we  confirmed  this  result  by northern  blot  analysis 
(Fig.  1b and  c).  However,  the  results  of  the  northern  blot 
by  using  XIST  probe  were  different  from 
the 
semi-quantitative RT -PCR results  of  the female( Sf.)  and 
KS  subject  in  terms  of  the  band  size  of the XIST  transcript 
(Fig.  1b).  There  was  the  same  positive  expression  for 
GAPDH  in  the  normal  male,  the  normal  female,  and  the 
KS  patient,  respectively  (Fig.  1c). 

Differential  expression  of  X  chromosomal  genes  in 
a  normal  male  vs  KS  patient  and  a  normal  female 
vs  KS  patient 

The  eDNA's  were  generated  through  reverse  transcription 
from  three  samples,  and  eDNA's  of  a  normal  female  and 
male  were  labeled  Cy3,  and eDNA of a  KS  patient  was 
Cy5  (Fig.  2a  and  b).  In  the  DNA  microarray,  218  genes 
were  X chromosome  specific  genes.  When  we compared 
the  KS  patient  with  a  normal  female,  we found  that  14 
genes  were  deferentially expressed  (Table 1).  When

gel  and  was  transferred  to  a positively  charged  nylon  yielding 
three  lanes.  The  figure  shows  bands  in  a lane of  the  female  and

comparing  a  normal  male  with  the  KS  patient  in  the  same 
way,  their  24  genes  were  differentially expressed  (Table 
1).  These  genes  showed  higher expression  by two-folds 
in  the  KS  patient  than  that  of  the  male  or  female  eDNA. 
According  to  a  previous  study,  Sudbrak  eta/.  (2001) 
found  through  the  eDNA  microarray  experiment  of  normal 
females,  normal  males,  and  females  with  supernumerary 
X  chromosome  that  many  genes  showed  elevated

Discussion 
In  this  study,  we  demonstrated  the  expression  pattern 
of  XIST  transcripts  in  the  normal  male  (46,  t ),  the  normal 
female  (46,  ~) and  the  KS  patient  (47,  XXY)  by 
semi-quantitative  RT -PCR (Fig.  1a).  The  XIST  expression 
in  the  KS  patient  can  be  an  identifying  factor  for  the 
existence  of  X  inactivation.  Interestingly,  there  was  a 
different expression  between  the  female  and  the  KS  patient 
for  the  240  bp  band  in  Fig.  1a;  there  was  more  expression 
in  the  female  than  the  KS  patient.  Further  research  is 
necessary to  narrow the  possible  reasons  this  data.  Then, 
we  verified  the XIST  expression  by semi-quantitative 
RT -PCR and  through  northern  blot  analysis  (Fig.  1b  and 
c).  Interestingly,  XIST  transcript  showed  the  double  band 
for  the  female  (46,  ~) and  the  KS  patient  (47,  XXY)  in 
Frg.  1b.  Hong  et a/.  (1999)  and  Memili  et a/.  (2001)  presented 
the  structural  data  for  the  murine  Xist  gene.  Two  major 
isoforms  of  Xist  can  be  detected  by  northern  analysis, 
which  are  consistent  with  differential  polyadenylation. 
According  to  the  recent  structure  of  human  XIST,  there 
is  a  high  sequence  similarity  between  the  3'  regions  of 
human  XIST  and  mouse  Xist.  However,  human  XIST  has 
an  intron  in  this  region,  and this  intron  spans  the  majority 
of  the  sequence  of  high  similarity  between  the  mouse 
and  human  (Hong  eta/.,  2000).  Our  data  may  indicate 
that  the  human  XIST  double  band  may  be,  in  fact, 
alternatively  spliced  forms  of  19.3kb  and  16.5kb 
transcripts. 

From  observing  the  results  of  the  semi-quantitative 
RT-PCR,  the  process  of  how X  inactivation  occurs  in 
the  KS  patient  was  a mystery.  A comparative  experiment 
of  X chromosome  gene  expression  in  a  normal  male, 
a  normal  female,  and  a  KS  patient was  performed  by 
eDNA  microarray.  We  have  identified the  significantly 
elevated  expression  of  14  genes  and  24  genes  on  the 
X chromosome  of  the  KS  patient  than  in  female  and  male 
controls  (F/M),  respectively.  We  suggest  that  X 
inactivations  of  KS  through  genes are  highly expressed 
tend  to  have an  abnormal  X  inactivation  mechanism. 
According  to  Sudbrak  eta!.  (2001),  females  with  a 
supernumerary X chromosome  have  many  genes  that 
were  found  to  escape X-inactivation.  In  cells  with  four 
or five  X chromosomes  for  such  as  XIST,  intracellular 
mRNA  concentrations  should  therefore  be from  three  to 
four  times  higher than  in  normal  female  cells.  Although 
both  the  normal  male  and the  KS  patient  have a  same 
man  with  Y chromosome,  the  expression  difference  is 
not  due to  the  numbers  of  X chromosomes.  The  data

comparing  the  KS  patient and  the  male  possibly show 
similar  results  to  the  data  between  the  KS  patient  and 
the  female  because the  genes that  are supposed  to  be 
inactivated  have  been  activated. 

Among  the  genes that  are  expressed  higher in  the 
KS  patient,  muscle  isoform  of  the  phosphorylase  kinase 
alpha  subunit  (PHKA1)  (Table  1)  and  ribosomal  protein 
S4,  X-linked  (RPS4X)  genes  (Table  1)  are  known  to  be 
physically  linked  with  XIST  near the  X inactivation  center 
(XIC)  (Fisher  et at.,  1990;  Lafreniere  et at.,  1993).  Further 
investigation  of  the  specific gene expression  near  Xic 
may  help  clarify the  mechanism  of  X  chromosome 
inactivation. 

Moreover,  members of  the  ETS  oncogene family  (ELK1) 

(Table 1)  belong  to the  ETS  oncogene superfamily,  and 
the  expression  of  this  gene is enhanced  in  a  testicular 
germ  cell  tumor  with  an  excess  of  active  X chromosomes 
(Kawakami  et at.,  2003).  Previous  studies  (Hasle  et at., 
1995;  Rapley  et at.,  2000)  reported  that  KS  can  be a 
risk factor  to  the  germ  cell  tumor.  Consequently,  we cannot 
exclude the  relationship  between  a  highly expressed  gene 
in  the  KS  patient  and  testicular  germ  cell  tumor  of  a 
normal  male. 

Therefore,  through  eDNA  microarray we  gained  the 
general  gene  expression  profile on  the  X chromosome 
of  a  KS  patient.  However,  for  a  systemic  study on  X 
inactivation  mechanism  a  repetition  of  the  experiment 
using  more  samples  is  necessary,  and  further  research

may be especially  needed  on  the  highly expressed  genes 
of  a  KS  patient.
