The introduction of metagenomics into the field of virology has facilitated the exploration of viral communities in various 
natural habitats. Understanding the viral ecology of a variety of sample types throughout the biosphere is important per se, 
but it also has potential applications in clinical and diagnostic virology. However, the procedures used by viral metagenomics 
may produce technical errors, such as amplification bias, while public viral databases are very limited, which may hamper the 
determination of the viral diversity in samples. This review considers the current state of viral metagenomics, based on 

examples from Korean viral metagenomic studies－i.e., rice paddy soil, fermented foods, human gut, seawater, and the 

near-surface atmosphere. Viral metagenomics has become widespread due to various methodological developments, and 
much attention has been focused on studies that consider the intrinsic role of viruses that interact with their hosts.

Introduction

Viruses  are  the  most  abundant  and  diverse  biological 
entities in the biosphere, and their global numbers have been 
estimated at 1.2 × 1030 and 2.6 × 1030 in the ocean and soil, 
respectively  [1].  Thus,  viruses  are  key  elements  that 
contribute  to  the  life  cycles  of  cellular  organisms  [2]. 
However, the study of viral ecology in natural habitats has 
been limited due to the difficulties of viral culture [3]. The 
lack of a ubiquitous marker gene, such as the 16S rRNA gene 
shared by all bacteria and archaea, also hampered our under-
standing of the genetic diversity of viruses, prior to the intro-
duction of metagenomics into the field of viral ecology [1, 4]. 
Recently,  viral  metagenomics  has  enabled  researchers  to 
explore the community structure and diversity of viruses in 
various natural ecosystems [5]. This methodology depends 
on a priori knowledge of the viral types that may be present 
[6, 7].

The  first  viral  metagenome  of  uncultured  marine  viral 
communities was published in 2002 [8], and there have been 
many  subsequent  advances  in  the  methodologies  (e.g., 
methods for amplifying the initial viral genomes) and tools 
used  for  bioinformatics  analysis  in  viral  metagenomics. 

These technical developments have facilitated explorations 
of the abundance and diversity of viruses from a wide range 
of natural habitats in Korea. In Korea, viral metagenomics 
was applied for the first time to unique samples, including 
fermented foods and atmospheric samples, as well as ha-
bitats where viruses are expected to have significant roles, 
such as rice paddy soil, seawater, and the human gut. This 
review describes recent advances in viral metagenomics and 
provides summaries of studies that have been conducted to 
characterize  Korean  viral  metagenomes.  In  addition,  the 
advantages and disadvantages of the most widely used viral 
DNA  amplification  methods  are  discussed,  based  on 
empirical  knowledge.  Further  directions  for  the  study  of 
virus-host interactions are also highlighted.

Approaches  to  Viral  Ecology  Using  Meta-
genomics

Viral  metagenomics  is  the  study  of  viral  metagenomes 
(known  as  viromes),  which  are  obtained  directly  from 
environmental samples using viral particle purification and 
shotgun  sequencing.  Viral  metagenomic  studies  have  in-
creased  gradually  since  the  expansion  of  metagenomic

approaches  to  viral  ecology;  i.e.,  over  200  (61  reviews) 
investigations  of  the  viral  communities  in  environmental 
samples  have  been  published  (Fig.  1)  [8-13].  In  2002, 
Breitbart  et  al.  [8]  used  shotgun  library  sequencing  and 
reported that the majority of the sequences in marine viral 
metagenomes shared no similarity with any genes in public 
databases, which suggested that most environmental viruses 
remained  uncharacterized.  This  was  the  first  study  using 
viral  metagenomic  approaches  in  the  field.  Subsequently, 
many studies have surveyed the viral diversity of unexplored 
habitats using viral metagenomics.

Cultivation in a host is usually necessary to obtain a virus 
from the environment that is being investigated. However, 
the  application  of  metagenomics  techniques  based  on 
genetic information can circumvent this obstacle [14]. Based 
on the physical characteristics of virions, viral particles can 
be isolated from environmental samples, which are enriched 
using a combination of size filtration (e.g., ＜0.22 μm) and 
density gradient centrifugation (e.g., 1.35-1.5 g/mL cesium 
chloride) [14], so that the virome can be obtained from the 
purified  viral  particles.  There  is  a  lack  of  evolutionarily 
conserved  genes,  such  as  the  prokaryotic  16S  ribosomal 
RNA gene, in viral genomes. Therefore, the fragmented viral 
metagenomic sequences obtained by whole-genome shot-
gun DNA sequencing are used to analyze the viral ecology 
instead. Viral genomes are small (on average, they comprise 
a  few  to  several  dozen  kilobases);  so,  valuable  genome 
coverage can be achieved easily by DNA sequencing. The 
advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 
454  pyrosequencing  and  Illumina  sequencing,  makes  it 

easier  to  achieve  suitable  genome  coverage  at  low  cost. 
Indeed, over 90 of either nearly complete or complete novel 
viral genomes were assembled using these methods in recent 
studies [9, 10, 15-20]. However, it is inevitable that an am-
plification step is necessary for small viral genomes prior to 
DNA sequencing. Linker amplified shotgun library (LASL) 
and  multiple  displacement  amplification  (MDA)  are  the 
main  methods  used  to  amplify  viromes  in  viral  metage-
nomics. The LASL method, developed by Breitbart et al. [8], 
PCR-amplifies  a  virome  after  adapter  attachment  to 
randomly fragmented viral DNAs. The application of adapter 
attachment is restricted to double-stranded DNA sequences; 
so,  only  double-stranded  DNA  (dsDNA)  viruses  can  be 
detected using the LASL method. Thus, the dominance of 
dsDNA  tailed  bacteriophages  was  reported  initially  in 
uncultured marine viral assemblages [8], as well as other 
environmental samples, such as kimchi [11], aquatic water 
[8], and feces [21]. The MDA technique [22] amplifies DNA 
isothermally  using  the  phi29  polymerase  and  random 
hexaprimers and has been used before in microbiology [22]. 
The high amplification efficiency of this method means that 
it  is  suitable  for  amplification  during  viral  metagenomics 
applications. Particularly, the phi29 polymerase of the MDA 
technique selectively amplifies circular genomes (estimated 
at 100 times) [10], and it has facilitated the discovery of 
abundant  single-stranded  DNA  and  RNA  viruses  in 
environmental samples [23, 24] (described in detail below).

Assignment  of  Viral  Sequences  Based  on 
Their Metadata and Potential Hosts

The  analysis  of  viral  metagenome  data  using  bioinfor-
matics  is  one  of  the  most  challenging  aspects  of  viral 
metagenomics. One million to 1 billion reads of viral meta-
genomic  sequences  are  typically  generated  by  high- 
throughput  sequencing  platforms  (with  an  average  read 
length of 350‒400 bp using 454 GS-FLX Titanium and 2 × 
150  bp  using  Illumina  HiSeq  2500).  After  removing  any 
low-quality,  redundant,  and  chimeric  sequences,  the  viral 
sequences are compared to sequences in public databases 
(e.g.,  the  GenBank  non-redundant  nucleotide  database, 
MG-RAST, and CAMERA) using BLAST [25] or USEARCH 
[26].  The  identification  of  viral  sequences  based  on 
significant amino acid similarity (E-value of <10－3) was first 
described  by  Breitbart  et  al.  [8],  and  it  has  since  been 
extended  to  the  exploration  of  environmental  viromes, 
although the E-score applied to viral metagenomic studies 
appears to be regarded as “a loose standard” [27].

Most  of  the  environmental  viromes  detected  by  viral 
metagenomics  are  defined  as  orphan  (unassigned)  se-
quences. The majority of viral sequences shares no amino 
acid similarity with previously observed genes (average 40% 
to 50%, occasionally up to 90%, of sequences); so, they are 
characterized  as  “unknown”  [5].  Comparisons  of  viral 
sequences with the data in public databases have demon-
strated  that  little  is  known  about  environmental  viruses. 
Thus,  the  majority  of  the  unassigned  sequences  in  viral 
metagenomes is often regarded as “junk sequences” due to a 
lack of suitable bioinformatics tools and viral databases for 
their characterization [1, 28]. At present, the viral databases 
are biased toward animal and plant viruses, although viruses 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  3,  2013

that  infect  prokaryotes  (bacteriophages)  are  sparsely  re-
presented. Most of the latter are restricted to phages that 
infect  bacteria  belonging  to  the  phyla  Proteobacteria, 
Firmicutes,  and  Actinobacteria  [29,  30].  Moreover,  even 
“known” viral sequences share low amino acid similarities 
(＜50%) with viral protein sequences [9, 11, 13, 31]; so, the 
majority of environmental viruses representing novel viral 
species and their viral diversity is much greater than con-
sidered previously. The observation of a high percentage of 
ORFans (open reading frames with no homologs in known 
genes in the databases) in viral genomes [32] also supports 
the  novelty  of  environmental  viromes.  Thus,  researchers 
could discover novel viruses in orphan sequence pools that 
currently  remain  “untapped  resources.”  These  findings 
indicate our current lack of knowledge about viral genetic 
information  and  emphasize  the  need  for  physiological 
studies  of  viruses  to  understand  viral  ecology  based  on 
genomic data.

Viral Metagenomes from Korean Samples

 Using viral metagenomic approaches, viral diversity and 
abundance  have  been  investigated  in  various  natural 
ecosystems in Korea, including rice paddy soil, fermented 
foods,  the  human  gut,  seawater,  and  the  near-surface 
atmosphere (Table 1). The morphologies of environmental 
viruses  have  been  imaged  using  transmission  electron 
microscopy (Fig. 2). Sipho- and podo-like tailed viruses were 
found  in  fermented  foods  (Fig.  2A-2C),  while  non-tailed 
small viruses were detected in the near-surface atmosphere 
(Fig. 2G-2I). Various types of tailed, non-tailed, circular, and 
long  linear  viruses  were  found  in  the  human  gut  (Fig. 
2D-2F). In general, the virions ranged in size from 30 to 60

nm.  In  agreement  with  the  results  of  previous  viral 
metagenomic studies [23, 31], over half of the sequences in 
the Korean environmental viromes were described as orphan 
sequences,  based  on  comparisons  with  viral  proteins  in 
public databases (Table 1). Most of the sequences identified 
were assigned to the Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Myoviridae 

families  of  dsDNA  viruses  and  the  Circoviridae,  Germi-
niviridae,  Nanoviridae,  and  Microviridae  families  of  ssDNA 
viruses (Fig. 3). The first viral metagenomic study in Korea 
surveyed uncultured viral assemblages in rice paddy soil in 
2008  [10],  where  MDA  was  used  with  phi29  DNA  poly
merase and random hexaprimers to amplify viral DNA and to 

124

construct clone libraries for metagenome sequencing. The 
soil was found to contain a rich pool of unknown ssDNA 
viruses and dsDNA viruses. This study also focused on the 
effect of MDA amplification on different types of genomic 
DNA and showed that MDA preferentially amplified circular 
DNA  genomes.  This  was  also  demonstrated  using  an 
environmental sample from surface seawater [12], where 
dsDNA  viruses  alone  were  retrieved  in  the  LASL  library, 
whereas ssDNA viruses were overwhelmingly represented 
in the MDA library. Thus, the amplification methods used in 
viral metagenomics can affect the ratios of viral sequences 
greatly and lead to inaccurate estimates of viral diversity.

Next,  Park  et  al.  [11]  investigated  the  abundance  and 
diversity  of  uncultured  viral  assemblages  in  fermented 
shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut－fermented foods that have 
been consumed for a long time around the world. In contrast 
to the soil virome, dsDNA bacteriophages from the families 
Myoviridae,  Podoviridae,  and  Siphoviridae  dominated  the 
fermented foods, and they contained a low complexity of 
viral  assemblages  compared  with  other  environmental 
habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, 
and soil. However, it is possible that the viral diversity of the 
viromes  detected  in  fermented  foods  may  have  been 
constrained to dsDNA viruses by the LASL method.

A large number of unknown microbes, such as bacteria, 
archaea, microbial eukarya, and viruses, constitute up to 1012 
bacteria per gram of feces in the human gastrointestinal tract 
[33],  and  it  is  expected  that  gut  viruses  will  affect  the 
relationships  among  viruses,  bacteria,  and  gut  epithelial 
cells [34]. Kim et al. [13] investigated the abundance and 
diversity of DNA viruses in fecal samples from five healthy 
Koreans, particularly ssDNA viruses. Using epifluorescence 
microscopy  with  SYBR  Gold  staining  [35],  the  viral 
abundance ranged from 108 to 109 per gram of feces, which 
was 10-fold less than the bacterial abundance in many other 
environments that harbored 10-100-fold more viruses (e.g., 
aquatic environments). Moreover, the diversity of gut viral 
assemblages  was  lower  than  that  of  gut  bacteria.  These 
results  support  Reyes  et  al.  [29],  who  found  that  viral- 
microbial interactions in the human intestine could not be 
described as a predator-prey relationship, and instead, it was 
referred to as “kill the winner,” which was driven by a lytic 
life cycle. 

Airborne  viruses  are  now  regarded  as  major  environ-
mental risk factors for complex disease pathogenesis [36- 
38].  However,  the  atmosphere  remains  “one  of  the  last 
frontiers of biological exploration on Earth” [9]. Using viral 
metagenomics with an advanced airborne particle sampling 
system,  Whon  et  al.  [9]  conducted  the  first  study  of  the 
diversity and community composition of airborne viruses in 
the  near-surface  atmosphere.  The  viral  abundance  in  the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  3,  2013

atmosphere  exhibited  seasonal  changes  (increasing  from 
autumn  to  winter  before  decreasing  until  spring)  in  the 
range  of  106  to  107  viruses  per  m3,  and  the  temporal 
variations in viral abundance were inversely correlated with 
seasonal  changes  in  temperature  and  absolute  humidity. 
Plant-associated  ssDNA  geminivirus-related  viruses  and 
animal-infecting  circoviruses  dominated  the  viral  assem-
blages, with low numbers of nanoviruses and microphages in 
air viromes, which suggests that airborne viral assemblages 
are affected greatly by terrestrial plants and animal activities.
The compositions of viral assemblages are determined by 
how the virome is amplified. Thus, the compositions of the 
viral assemblages detected in fermented foods and marine 
samples are biased toward dsDNA viruses, such as sipho-, 
podo-,  and  myophages,  when  the  LASL  method  is  used, 
whereas the viral assemblages detected in rice paddy soil, 
human gut, marine, and near-surface atmosphere samples 
contain high proportions of ssDNA viral sequences, due to 
the  use  of  MDA,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  In  addition,  the 
compositions  of  the  viral  assemblages  characterized  in 
Korean  environments  tend  to  depend  on  their  specific 
microbial  features.  The  human  gastrointestinal  tract  and 
fermented  foods  are  exposed  to  massive  numbers  of  gut 
bacteria  and  lactic  acid  bacteria,  respectively  [39-41].  By 
contrast,  the  atmosphere  contains  far  less  cellular  meta-
bolism and reproductive activity than other environments, 
such as the soil, seawater, fermented foods, and the human 
gut [42]. On this basis, the lowest abundance of eukaryotic 
viruses was observed in the viral assemblages in the human 
gut  and  fermented  foods,  whereas  a  high  abundance  of 
eukaryotic viruses was detected in the near-surface atmo-
sphere. High levels of prokaryote and eukaryote cells are 
present in rice paddy soil [43] and seawater [44], and so, 
comparable  amounts  of  bacteriophages  and  eukaryotic 
viruses were detected in their viromes.

Discovery  of  Single-Stranded  DNA  Viruses 
in Korean Environments

The development of viral metagenomics has facilitated the 
discovery of novel, previously undescribed viral species. An 
artifact of the MDA method is that it selectively amplifies the 
circular genomes of ssDNA viruses, so that a large number of 
ssDNA  viral  sequences  have  been  identified  in  environ-
mental  viromes.  Thus,  there  is  great  interest  in  the  dis-
tribution  and  host  range  of  ssDNA  viruses.  In  particular, 
microphages from the family Microviridae have been identi-
fied in a wide range of environments [13, 45, 46]. In contrast 
to  the  ecology  of  marine  dsDNA  phages,  marine  ssDNA 
phages in the family Microviridae have distinct spatial and 
temporal  distributions  [45].  ssDNA  microphages  were

125

MS  Kim,  et  al.  Viral  Metagenomics

abundant in the healthy human gut and their genotypes were 
much  more  diverse  than  those  reported  previously  [13]. 
Moreover,  prophage-like  elements  in  the  genomes  of  gut 
microbes,  such  as  Bacteroides  and  Prevotella  spp.,  were 
characterized as a novel subgroup in the family Microviridae 
[13, 47], while viral sequences from the human gut were 
clustered with prophage-like elements from Bacteroides and 
Prevotella  spp.  [13].  This  suggests  that  Bacteroides  and 
Prevotella  spp.  are  included  within  the  host  range  of  the 
ssDNA microphages in the human gut [47].

Eukaryotic  ssDNA  viruses  that  infect  plants  and 
mammals have been identified in many environmental viro-
mes. Circoviruses that are known to infect birds and pigs 
have also been identified in the viromes of invertebrates and 
a fish [48, 49], while geminiviruses that cause plant diseases 
have been detected in whiteflies, which act as insect vectors 
of  plant  viruses  [50].  A  recent  study  by  Whon  et  al.  [9] 
investigated airborne DNA viral assemblages in near-surface 
atmosphere  samples  and  showed  that  a  high  number  of 
viruses (log 6 to 7 viruses per m3) were present in the air, 
which  were  dominated  by  geminivirus-related  viruses. 
These  viruses  were  identified  as  plant  fungal  pathogen- 
infecting mycoviruses－i.e., Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypoviru-
lence-associated  DNA  virus  1－which  indicates  that  the 
airborne viral assemblages in the near-surface atmosphere 
may  have  strong  interactions  with  plants.  These  results 
highlight the extensive distribution of ssDNA viruses in a 
wide range of environments, and their host ranges may be 
wider  than  previously  recognized.  Thus,  the  discovery  of 
novel  genomes  of  ssDNA  viral  families  in  metagenomic 
studies could revolutionize our knowledge of the ecology 
and evolution of ssDNA viruses.

Virus-Host Interactions and Emerging Tech-
nologies

In the last decade, viral ecologists have focused on com-
munity-level analyses of viruses to understand their abun-
dance and genetic diversity in specific environments. The 
ecological effects of viruses, particularly bacteriophages, are 
known to control host populations via the “kill the winner 
system,” while they drive mortality and evolutionary change 
in microorganisms via lateral gene transfer by infecting their 
host  bacteria,  although  the  basic  issue  of  “who  infects 
whom” is poorly understood [2, 29, 51, 52]. In the ocean, for 
example, viruses regulate the microbial abundance, release 
dissolved organic matter, and affect global biogeochemical 
cycles by killing up to 40% of host bacteria per day [53, 54]. 
In  contrast,  symbiotic  functions  of  viruses,  such  as  host 
survival,  competition,  and  protection  from  pathogenic 
infections, are beginning to be understood [55], and evi-

dence for a beneficial interaction in phage-host interactions 
was found in the mammalian gut ecosystem [29, 56]. When 
host  survival  is  threatened,  a  variety  of  environmental 
factors  can  trigger  prophage  induction,  and  the  liberated 
prophages may become completely virulent [57]. Overall, 
these studies suggest that prophage induction may respon-
sible for triggering dysbiosis and changes in the microbial 
population by altering host phenotypes, thereby leading to a 
new environmental niche.

Traditionally, host culture-dependent techniques, such as 
plaque assays, have been widely used for the identification of 
phage  and  host  bacteria  interactions.  However,  plaque 
assays  require  isolated  host  bacteria;  so,  they  are  low- 
throughput methods. This method is also difficult to apply 
to  environmental  samples  where  lysogenic  infections  are 
prevalent,  because  the  method  relies  on  observations  of 
visible  plaque  formations,  which  are  often  absent  from 
lysogenic infections [3, 58, 59]. Recently, Deng et al. [52] 
demonstrated a new technique, known as “viral tagging,” for 
identifying the interactions between cultivated host bacteria 
and their phages, which used the nucleic acid stain SYBR 
Gold to generate fluorescently labeled phages, so that the 
host cells fluoresced with viral tagging, thereby allowing the 
sorting of virus-tagged cells by flow cytometry [52, 60]. This 
emerging  technique  is  undoubtedly  helpful  for  not  only 
exploring  virus-host  interactions  in  their  natural  habitats 
when  the  method  is  combined  with  other  experimental 
tools,  such  as  single  viral  genomics  [61]  and  phageFISH 
[62], but also identifying viral receptors in macro-organisms 
(e.g., the mammalian gut) if the method is combined with a 
fluorescently  labeled  receptor  protein  during  histological 
examinations.

Conclusion

The  emergence  of  viral  metagenomics  has  facilitated 
advances  in  virology  and  allowed  us  to  understand  novel 
aspects of viral ecology. At present, viral metagenomics is a 
powerful and sensitive technique for detecting viruses that 
cannot be identified by traditional culture- and sequence- 
based  approaches.  Most  importantly,  viral  metagenomics 
suggests  that  novel  viruses  interact  constantly  with  the 
human population. Thus, viral metagenomics can facilitate 
the improved surveillance of viral pathogens in the fields of 
public health and food security. This technique can be used 
to understand viral ecology by exploring the environmental 
viromes that are generated by viral metagenomics.
