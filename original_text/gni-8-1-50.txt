Abstract

Mercuric  chloride,  a  model  nephrotoxicant  was  used  to 
elucidate  time-  and  dose-  dependent  global  gene  ex-
pression  changes  associated  with  proximal 
tubular 
toxicity.  Rat  kidney  cell  lines  NRK-52E  cells  were  ex-
posed  for  2,  6  and  12  hours  and  with  3  different  doses 
of  mercuric  chloride.  Cell  viability  assay  showed  that 
mercuric  chloride  had  toxic  effects  on  NRK-52E  cells 
causing  20%  cell  death  (IC20)  at  40μM  concentration. 
We  set  this  IC20  as  high  dose  concentration  and  1/5 
and  1/25  concentration  of  LC20  were  used  as  mid  and 
low  concentration,  respectively.  Analyses  of  microarray 
data  revealed  that  738  genes  were  differentially  ex-
pressed  (more  than  two-fold  change  and  p＜0.05)  by 
low  concentration  of  mercuric  chloride  at  least  one  time 
point  in  NRK-52E  cells.  317  and  2,499  genes  were  dif-
ferentially  expressed  at  mid  and  high  concentration  of 
mercuric  chloride,  respectively.  These  deregulated  genes 
showed  a  primary  involvement  with  protein  trafficking 
(CAV2,  CANX,  CORO1B),  detoxification  (GSTs)  and  im-
munity  and  defense  (HMOX1,  NQO1).  Several  of  these 
genes  were  previously  reported  to  be  up-regulated  in 
proximal  tubule  cells  treated  with  nephrotoxicants  and 
might  be  aid  in  promoting  the  predictive  biomarkers  for 
nephrotoxicity.

Introduction

Mercury  is  unique  among  the  heavy  metals  in  that  it  can 
exist  in  several  physical  and  chemical  forms,  including 
elemental  mercury,  which  is  a  liquid  at  room  temper-
ature  (Zalups,  2000).  Among  the  chemical  forms  of  mer-

cury,  the  inorganic  species  are  far  more  nephrotoxic. 
Renal  proximal  tubular  cells  represent  the  primary  target 
site,  where  highly  reactive  inorganic  mercury  ions  rapidly 
accumulate  and  induce  acute  or  chronic  kidney  injuries 
(Zalups,  2000).  Despite  the  numerous  studies  the  mech-
anisms  whereby  this  metal  exerts  its  negative  effects  in 
the  kidney  is  not  fully  understood.  One  of  the  main  and 
common  mechanisms  behind  heavy  metal  toxicity  has 
been  attributed  to  oxidative  stress.  Mercury  induces  oxi-
dative  stress  and  ROS  production  by  binding  to  intra-
cellular  thiols.  This  metal  also  cause  direct  damage  to 
the  mitochondrial  and  microsome  metabolism,  and 
modifies  renal  cell  membrane  and  tubular  polarity  (Lash 
and  Zalups,  1992). 
    Changes  in  the  expression  of  mRNA  specifically  ex-
pressed  in  the  injured  kidney  cells  are  some  of  the  ear-
liest  events  that  accompany  renal  injury.  This  is  accom-
panied  by  alterations  in  the  expression  of  other  genes 
(e.g.  KIM1,  cystatin  C,  clusterin  and  osteopontin)  that 
contribute  either  to  cellular  repair  or  recovery  of  renal 
function  (Amin  et al.,  2004).  A  number  of  approaches 
have  been  used  to  identify  components  of  the  complex 
responses  to  nephrotoxicants,  which  are  not  only  poten-
tial  biomarkers  but  also  therapeutic  targets.  Gene  ex-
pression  in  acute  renal  failure  has  been  analyzed  with 
microarrays  in  several  studies  (Amin et al.,  2004;  Huang 
et al.,  2001;  Safirstein,  2004).  However,  the  results  vary 
because  of  a  lot  of  potential  confounding  factor,  such 
as  species  difference,  injury  difference,  microarray  plat-
form  difference  and  dose  and  time  difference. 
    Many  studies  identified  KIM1  as  potential  renal  mark-
er  through  gene  expression  analyses  after  kidney  injury. 
KIM1  is  a  type  I  transmenbrane  protein  that  is  not  de-
tectable  in  normal  kidney  but  is  expressed  at  high  levels 
in  proximal  tubule  epithelial  cells  after  toxic  injury 
(Ferguson et al.,  2008;  Ichimura et al.,  2004).  Recently, 
the  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  and 
European  Medicines  Agency  have  adopted  KIM1  as  a 
standard  biomarker  for  the  preclinical  safety  evaluation 
of  novel  drug  candidates.  While  KIM1  was  adopted  as 
a  biomarker  of  renal  toxicity,  several  studies  were  un-
dertaken  in  order  to  evaluate  the  utility  of  other  putative 
renal  toxicity  biomarkers. 
    To  circumvent  inconsistency  caused  by  confounding 
factors  in in vivo  studies,  we  set  an in vitro  study  model 
for  nephrotoxicity  by  using  a  rat  kidney  epithelium  origi-
nated  cell  line,  NRK-52.  To  address  biological  effect  of 
mercuric  chloride  on  the  cell  line,  Rat  Genome  Survey 

Arrays  array  was  used  to  determine  gene  expression 
pattern  elicited  by  mercuric  chloride  in  NRK-52E  kidney 
cell  lines. 

Methods

Chemicals

Mercuric  chloride  was  purchased  Sigma  (St.  Louis,  MO, 
USA).  DMEM,  Fetal  bovine  serum  (FBS),  penicillin/strep-
tomycin,  TRIzol  and  DEPC-treated  water  were  obtained 
from  Invitrogen  (Carlsbad,  CA,  USA).

Cell  culture 

NRK-52E  cell  line,  a  rat  renal  proximal  tubular  cell,  were 
cultured  in  DMEM/F-12  (50/50)  medium  supplemented 
with  10%  heat-inactivated  FBS,  0.02M  NaHCO3,  100 
U/ml  penicillin  and  100  mg/ml  streptomycin  and  main-
tained  in  monolayer  culture  at  37oC  in  an  incubator  of 
humidified  air  with  5%  CO2.  Subconfluent  cells  (80%) 
were  passaged  with  a  solution  containing  0.05%  trypsin 
and  0.02%  EDTA.

Cell  viability  assay

NRK-52E  cells  were  treated  with  test  substances  dis-
solved  in  PBS  for  12  h.  After  the  treatment,  cell  viability 
was  assessed  using  MTT  assay  kit  (Sigma,  St.  Louis, 
MO,  USA).  The  cell  culture  medium  was  withdrawn  by 
remaining  100μl/well  at  the  end  of  exposure  time.  An 
addition  of  10μl/well  MTT  stock  solution  (5  mg/ml)  is 
followed  by  an  incubation  period  of  4h  (37oC,  5%  CO2). 
Afterwards  100μl/well  solubilization  solution  was  added, 
followed  by  a  mixing.  A  kinetic  assay  was  performed  by 
measuring  its  absorbance  (570  nm)  in  a  SpectraMax  mi-
croplate  reader  (Molecular  Devices,  Sunnyvale,  CA,  USA). 
Absorbance  values  were  obtained  from  more  than  three 
independent  experiments.

Chemical  treatment  and  RNA  extraction

Mercuric  chloride  was  treated  with  1/25  of  IC20  (1.6μM, 
low),  1/5  of  IC20  (8μM,  mid)  or  IC20  (40μM,  high),  and 
total  RNA  were  obtained  at  2,  6  or  12  h  after  initial 
treatment.
    Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  each  time  and  dose 
point  using  Trizol  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s 
procedures.  The  quality  of  the  total  RNA  was  assessed 
using  an  Agilent  2100  Bioanalyzer.  RNA  quantification 
and  purity  (260/280  ratio)  were  determined  with  a  UV/VIS 
spectrophotometer  (ND-1000,  NanoDrop  Technologies, 
Wilmington,  DE,  USA).

The  Applied  Biosystems  Rat  Genome  Survey  Arrays 
(Applied  Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA),  which  con-
tain  60-mer  oligonucleotide  probes  representing  a  set  of 
32,878  individual  mouse  genes  and  more  than  250  con-
trol  probes,  were  used  for  differential  gene  expression 
profiles.  Microarray  experiments  were  performed  accord-
ing 
instructions.  Digoxigenin 
(DIG)-UTP-labeled  cRNA  was  generated  from  5μg  of 
total  RNA  and  amplified  using  a  chemiluminescent  re-
verse  transcription  (RT)  in vitro  transcription  labeling  kit 
(Applied  Biosystems).  Briefly,  each  microarray  was  pre-
hybridized  in  hybridization  buffer  with  blocking  reagent 
at  55oC  for  1  h.  DIG-labeled  cRNA  targets  (10μg)  were 
fragmented  to  100∼400  bp  and  hybridized  with  each 
prehybridized  microarray  at  55oC  for  16  h.  The  arrays 
were  washed  with  hybridization  wash  buffer  and  then 
with  chemiluminescence  rinse  buffer.  Chemiluminescent 
signals  were  generated  by  incubating  the  arrays  with 
anti-DIG-alkaline  phosphatase  and  chemiluminescence 
substrate.  Images  were  collected  for  each  microarray 
using  the  1700  Chemiluminescent  Microarray  Analyzer 
(Applied  Biosystems).  Microarray  images  were  auto-
gridded,  and  the  chemiluminescent  signals  were  quanti-
fied,  corrected  for  background,  spatially  normalized,  and 
exported  for  a  quality  report.  Microarray  data  with  qual-
ity  reports  above  the  manufacturer's  threshold  were 
used  for  further  analysis.

Analysis  of  microarray  expression  data

Signal  intensities  were  imported  into  GenPlex  software 
(Istech,  Korea),  where  inter-array  quantile  normalization 
was  performed  to  minimize  the  effect  of  external  varia-
bles  that  might  be  introduced  into  the  data.  Quality  fil-
tering  of  unreliable  spots  (flag  value＜100  and  S/N＜2) 
was  performed  before  normalization.  Then,  the  ex-
pression  intensities  were  log2  transformed.  We  took  the 
average  value  from  the  gene  expression  ratio  obtained 
in  three  biological  replicates.  DEGs  were  selected  on 
the  basis  of  ratios  (fold  change＞2)  and  Welch’s  t-test 
(p＜0.05).  Additionally,  DEGs  were  categorized  accord-
ing  to  their  biological  processes  using  the  PANTHER 
(Protein  ANalysis  THrough  Evolutionary  Relationships) 
protein  classification  system  (www.pantherdb.org,  Mi  et 
al.,  2005).  The  PANTHER  system  provides  probability  of 
each  biological  process  by  comparing  the  DEG  list  to 
the  reference  list  containing  all  the  probes  present  on 
the  array.  The  over-/down-representation  of  each  bio-
logical  process  is  determined  by  Fisher’s  exact  test  in 
combination  with  Bonferroni  correction 
for  multiple 
testing.

Results 

Cell  viability  following  treatment  with  mercuric  chloride
The  effect  of  mercuric  chloride  on  NRK-52E  cells  was 
monitored  by  MTT  assay.  Based  on  the  results  of  MTT 
assay,  the  20%  cell  viability  inhibition  concentration 
(IC20)  of  mercuric  chloride  was  calculated  from  non-lin-
ear  regression  analysis.  As  a  result,  the  IC20  value  of 
mercuric  chloride  in  NRK-52E  cells  was  found  to  be  40 
μM  (Fig.  1). 

Identification  of  differentially  expressed  genes

Mercuric  chloride  was  treated  to  NRK-52E  cells  at  a 
concentration  of  1/25  of  IC20  (1.6μM,  low),  1/5  of  IC20 
(8μM,  mid)  or  IC20  (40μM,  high)  for  2,  6,  12  h  and  0h 
(the  control).  Total  RNA  isolated  from  NRK-52E  cells 
were  subjected  to  each  microarray  experiment.  For  each 
dose  treatment  (low,  mid  and  high),  genes  with  statisti-
cally  significant  expression  changes  were  identified  us-
ing  fold  change  (fold＞2)  and  Welch’s  t-test  (p＜0.05). 
    For  low-concentration  mercuric  chloride  treatment 
group,  738  genes  were  significantly  expressed  ＞2-fold 
with  p＜0.05  at  least  at  one  time  point  during  the 
experiment.  In  detail,  we  found  229  up-regulated  genes 
and  72  down-regulated  genes  on  2  h,  137  up-regulated 
genes  and  129  genes  were  down-regulated  on  6h  and 
175  up-regulated  genes  and  242  down-regulated  genes 

on  12h  respectively.  738  differentially  expressed  genes 
in  low  treatment  group  were  individually  annotated,  and 
the  predominant  biological  processes  represented  by 
these  genes  were  identified  using  PANTHER  approach. 
As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  most  significantly  over-repre-
sented  biological  processes  were  “protein  metabolism 
and  modification”,  “nucleic  acid  metabolism”,  “intracel-
lular  protein  traffic”,  “cell  cycle”  and  “cell  structure  and

motility”.  Among  them,  many  “intracellular  protein  traf-
fic”-related  genes  showed  expression  pattern  of  con-
sistent  up-regulation  (Table  1).
    For  mid-concentration  mercuric  chloride  treatment 
group,  317  genes  were  significantly  expressed  ＞2-fold 
with  p＜0.05  at  least  at  one  time  point  during  the 
experiment.  In  detail,  we  found  121  up-regulated  genes 
and  69  down-regulated  genes  on  2  h,  107  up-regulated 
genes  and  28  down-regulated  genes  on  6h  and  38 
up-regulated  genes  and  25  down-regulated  genes  on  12 
h  respectively.  Changes  in  the  expression  of  genes  re-

lated  to  “detoxification”  were  significantly  over-repre-
sented  in  the  317  differentially  expressed  genes  of  mid 
treatment  group  (Fig.  3).  Interestingly,  genes  related  to 
“detoxification”  were  shown  more  than  2  fold  ex-
pression  changes  in  the  6h  time  point  mainly  (Table  2). 
It  was  found  that  most  genes  in  this  category  were  glu-
tathione-S-transferases. 
    For  high-concentration  mercuric  chloride  treatment 
group,  2,499  genes  were  significantly  expressed  ＞2- 
fold  with  p＜0.05  at  least  at  one  time  point  during  the 
experiment.  In  detail,  we  found  141  up-regulated  genes

respectively.  The  number  of  common  genes  in  all  3

Discussion

It  has  been  demonstrated  that  heavy  metals  share  com-
mon  primary  mechanisms  of  toxicity,  including  oxidative 

stress,  reaction  with  intracellular  thiols  and  interference 
with  essential  metals  (Stacchiotti  et al.,  2009).  Renal 
toxicity  commonly  occurs  after  administration  of  xeno-
biotics,  including  heavy  metals.  The  process  is  typically 
started  by  a  toxic  injury  to  tubular  epithelial  cells  in  vari-
ous  nephron  segments  or  by  injury  to  specific  cell  types 
in  the  glomerulus  (Amin et al.,  2004).  Mercuric  chloride 
produces  toxic  effects  on  the  third  segment  (S3)  of  the 
proximal  tubule  of  kidney  (Carranza-Rosales  et  al.,

2005).  Changes  in  the  expression  of  mRNA  expressed  in 
the  injured  kidney  cells  are  some  of  the  earliest  events 
that  accompany  renal  injury.
    In  this  study,  we  used  microarrays  to  examine 
changes  in  gene  expression  patterns  in  rat  tubular  epi-
thelial  renal  cells  (NRK-52E)  after  treatment  of  mercuric 
chloride.  First,  we  analyzed  temporal  expression  pattern 
and  examined  over-represented  biological  processes  for 
each  dose  treatment  (low,  mid  and  high  concentration). 
For  low-concentration  treatment  group,  it  is  noticed  that 
many  genes  were  differentially  expressed  and  their  re-
lated  biological  processes  (5  categories)  were  highly 
over-represented  according  to  PANTHER  analysis.  In 
particular,  “intracellular  protein  traffic”-related  genes 
were  highly  enriched  in  this  group  and  genes  belonged 
to  this  biological  process  showed  consistent  up-regu-
lation  at  all  time  points  of  low-concentration  treatment. 
A  common  intracellular  effect  of  toxic  metals  is  the  im-
paired  endocytosis  and  intracellular  vesicle  recycling. 
Mercury  is  described  to  be  internalized  by  proximal  tu-
bule  cells  through  endocytosis  of  mercury-protein  com-

It  seems  that  the  expression  of  “intracellular  protein  traf-

mercury.  One  highly  up-regulated  gene  in  this  group 
was  caveolin  2  (＞8-fold  change),  which  plays  a  key 
role  in  transcytosis  of  specific  membrane  proteins  and 
ligands  in  endothelial  cells  (Hansen  and  Nichols,  2009). 
Additionally,  our  results  were  consistent  with  a  previous 
report  where  described  the  modulation  in  genes  related 
to  “intracellular  vesicle  movement”  after  gentamycin-in-
duced  renal  injury  (Ozaki  et al.,  2009). 
    For  mid-concentration  treatment  group,  we  detected 
an  over-representation  of  genes  related  to  “detoxifica-
tion”.  Most  genes  in  this  category  were  glutathione- 
S-transferases  (GSTs).  GSTs  are  three  enzyme  families 
with  different  subcellular  locations  that  detoxify  noxious 
xenobiotics  and  protect  against  reactive  compounds 
produced  during  oxidative  stress  (Stacchiotti  et  al., 
2009).  During  GST-mediated 
reactions,  glutathione 
(GSH)  is  conjugated  with  various  electrophiles  or  oxida-
tion  end  product  and  the  GSH  adducts  are  actively  se-
creted  by  the  cell.  This  GSH-conjugated  efflux  can  re-
sult  in  the  depletion  of  cellular  thiol.  It  is  probable  that 
expression  of  most  GSTs  mRNA  in  this  study  increased 
on  6  h  and  decreased  on  12  h  due  to  depletion  of  thiol 
in  the  cells.  Glutathione  S-transferage  M1  (GSTM1) 
mRNA  level  was  up-regulated  after  mercuric  chloride 
treatment  (6  h  and  12  h)  in  this  study.  GSTM1  gene 
encodes  GST  Yb1  protein  which  described  as  urinary 
leakage  biomarker  for  distal  tubule  damage  (Kilty et al., 
2007).  Additionally,  GSTA3  mRNA 
level  was  also 
up-regulated  at  all  time  points.  α-GST  is  a  cytosolic 
enzyme  expressed  in  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  proximal 
tubule  (Sundberg  et al.,  1994).  The  appearance  of  α- 
GST  in  urine  is  thought  to  result  from  the  leakage  of  cy-
tosolic  contents  when  proximal  tubule  epithelial  cells  die 
(Ferguson  et al.,  2008;  Vaidya  et al.,  2008).  Up-regu-
lation  of  GSTs  mRNA  in  our  study  was  concomitant  with 
a  previous  study  which  demonstrated  activation  of  this 
enzyme  after  mercury  and  lead  treatment  (Stacchiotti et 
al.,  2009). 
    Many  Genes  (2,499  genes)  that  were  significantly 
regulated  by  high-concentration  mercuric  chloride  treat-
ment  grouped  into  7  major  functional  categories  (Fig.  4). 
These  genes  were  shown  to  be  associated  with  the 
apoptotic  and/or  necrotic  effect  of  mercuric  chloride.  Of 
these  genes,  heme  oxygenase  1  (HMOX1)  and  activating 
transcription  factor  3  (ATF3)  showed  remarkable  over- 
expression  (more  than  8-fold)  by  high-concentration 
treatment  at  all  3  time  points.  HMOX1  was  previously 
reported  to  be  induced  in  kidney  following  toxic  and  is-
chemic  insults  (Nath,  2006,  Takahashi  et al.,  2004). 
Up-regulation  of  ATF3  mRNA  was  also  reported  pre-
viously  to  be  induced  by  gentamycin  treatment  and  after 
ischemic  and  nephrotoxic  acute  renal  failure  (Ozaki  et 
al.,  2009,  Yuen  et al.,  2006).

    We  detected  21  known  genes  common  in  all  3  con-
centration  treatment  group.  Most  of  them  were  classified 
into  “detoxification”/“immunity  and  defense”  category 
(Table  3).  Early  growth  response  1  (EGR1),  one  of  the 
common  genes  was  reported  in  previous  study  that  ex-
pression  of  EGR1,  a  zinc-finger  transcription  factor,  in-
creased  by  oxalate  treatment  on  the  porcine  renal  epi-
(Jonassen  et  al.,  1999). 
thelial  LLC-PK1  cell 
NAD(P)H  dehydrogenase,  quinone  1  (NQO1),  another 
gene  in  common  group,  has  been  reported  to  show  in-
creased  protein  expression  and  activity  after  treatment 
of  iron  nitrilotriacetate  (FeNTA).  This  induces  acute  prox-
imal  tubular  necrosis  as  a  consequence  of  lipid  perox-
idation  and  oxidative  tissue  damage  (Tanaka  et al., 
2008).
    In  our  study,  we  did  not  identify  deregulation  of  KIM1, 
which  is  reported  as  a  sensitive  maker  of  renal  injury  in-
duced  by  a  variety  of  agent  including  cisplatin,  S-(1,  1, 
2,  2-tetrafluorethyl)-L-cysteine,  folic  acid  (Ichimura et al., 
2004,  Vaidya et al.,  2006),  Hg  (Zhou et al.,  2008),  chro-
mium  (Zhou  et al.,  2008),  cadimium  (Prozialeck  et al., 
2009)  and  cyclosporine  (P?rez-Rojas et al.,  2007).  Since 
the  alteration  of  KIM1  in  these  studies  was  depicted  by 
using  in vivo  model  not  in vitro  model,  it  seems  that 
missing  of  KIM1  modulation  in  current  study  resulted 
from  the  difference  between  model  systems. 
    In  summary,  we  were  able  to  identify  a  number  of 
genes  which  showed  significant  changes  at  mRNA  level 
in  response  to  mercuric  chloride,  a  model  nephroto-
xicant.  Most  interestingly,  some  of  the  genes  (e.g. 
GSTM1,  HMOX1,  ATF3  and  EGR1)  were  previously  re-
ported  to  be  induced  in  proximal  tubule  cells  after 
chemical  insults  on  kidney.  Our  study  provided  support-
ing  evidences  at  molecular  level  for  these  previously  re-
ported  putative  nephrotoxicity  biomarker.  However  it  will 
be  needed  additional  studies  on  reversibility,  specificity 
and  sensitivity  of  the  putative  biomarkers  to  be  vali-
dated.
