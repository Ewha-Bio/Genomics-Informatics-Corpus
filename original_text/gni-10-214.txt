The recent advent of next-generation sequencing technologies has dramatically changed the nature of biomedical research. 

Human genetics is no exception－it has never been easier to interrogate human patient genomes at the nucleotide level to 

identify disease-associated variants. To further facilitate the efficiency of this approach, whole exome sequencing (WES) was 
first developed in 2009. Over the past three years, multiple groups have demonstrated the power of WES through robust 
disease-associated variant discoveries across a diverse spectrum of human diseases. Here, we review the application of WES 
to different types of inherited human diseases and discuss analytical challenges and possible solutions, with the aim of 
providing a practical guide for the effective use of this technology.

Introduction

Whole  exome  sequencing  (WES)  is  a  technique  to 
selectively capture and sequence the coding regions of all 
annotated protein-coding genes. Coupled with next-gene-
ration sequencing (NGS) platforms, it enables the analysis of 
functional  regions  of  the  human  genome  with  unpre-
cedented efficiency. Since its first reported application [1, 2], 
WES  has  emerged  as  a  powerful  and  popular  tool  for 
researchers elucidating genetic variants underlying human 
diseases (Fig. 1) despite certain limitations (see below).

Overview of WES Pipeline

WES pipelines generally follow a similar process, regard-
less  of  the  capture  method  and  NGS  platform  used,  as 
summarized  in  Fig.  2.  The  experimental  pipeline  can  be 
divided into two parts: 1) preparing genomic DNA libraries 
and hybridizing them to capture arrays and 2) NGS of the 
eluted target fragments. There are a number of commercially 
available capture arrays, and their strengths and weaknesses 
have  been  well  described  elsewhere  [3].  Once  short  se-
quencing reads have been generated, they are mapped to the 
reference human genome, and variant calling is carried out. 

Subsequent  annotation  of  these  variants  is  necessary  to 
further  evaluate  their  potential  biological  effect;  publicly 
available  software  and  databases  can  be  used  for  this 
purpose.

Strengths and Weaknesses of WES

WES is a robust technology that is extremely practical for 
investigating  coding  variation  at  the  genome-wide  level. 
Despite the plummeting cost of sequencing in the past few 
years, WES at mean coverage depth of 100× still costs five 
times less than whole genome sequencing (WGS) at mean 
coverage depth 30×. In addition, the size of WES data per 
patient is approximately a sixth of WGS data, resulting in 
reduced processing time and imposing less of a burden in 
terms of data storage.

However, it is important to understand the limitations of 
WES technology. Certain protein-coding regions might not 
be  covered  due  to  incomplete  annotation  of  the  human 
genome. Further, WES does not cover potentially functional 
non-coding  elements,  including  untranslated  regions,  en-
hancers, and long-noncoding RNAs, although these are, in 
themselves, not clearly defined. Another drawback to WES is 
the limited ability to detect structural variations, such as

In spite of these limitations, WES is still the tool of choice 
for many researchers－its practical advantages allow large 
numbers of patients to be screened in a robust fashion, a 
crucial  aspect  of  mutation  discovery  in  human  genetics 
research.

Application of WES to Various Human Dise-
ase Types

WES has been used in identifying genetic variants asso-
ciated with a variety of diseases. Here, we discuss different 
categories of inherited human disease and the methodology 
employed to examine each case.

Mendelian Diseases, Recessive

Diseases inherited in a recessive pattern have traditionally 
been highly amenable to genetic analysis, due to the fact that 
homozygous variants are easily detectable. Previously, if a 
large family with many affected members was available for 
pedigree  analysis,  one  would  perform  linkage  analysis  by 
genotyping family members in order to identify relatively 
short  genomic  intervals  that  presumably  contained  the 
disease-associated  variant.  Direct  interrogation  of  entire 
genomes for homozygous variants is now possible with NGS 
technologies,  and  public  datasets  can  be  used  to  exclude 
common  variants  that  are  less  probable  to  be  disease- 
causing. Identifying recessive variants is especially straight-
forward  if  the  proband  is  a  product  of  a  consanguineous

marriage－sequencing the entire exome of the patient would 
likely  yield  a  manageable  number  of  rare  homozygous 
variants, and further studies could be performed to inve-
stigate the functional relevance of these variants. 

In one of the earliest reports of the application of WES 
technology, Bilgüvar et al. [4] identified recessive mutations 
in WDR62 in multiple Turkish consanguineous patients with 
severe developmental brain defects. Very little was known 
about  WDR62  at  that  time,  but  subsequent  genetic  and 
functional studies have since validated the  importance of 
this gene in proper brain development. More recently, a large 
cohort  of  patients  of  similar  genetic  status  and  clinical 
manifestation were analyzed using homozygosity mapping 
from WES data [5]. The authors uncovered 22 genes not 
previously  identified  as  disease-causing,  further  demon-
strating the power of WES as an ideal tool for gene discovery.

Mendelian Diseases, Dominant

Mendelian diseases with dominant modes of inheritance 
pose greater technical challenges for genetic analysis. Hete-
rozygous variants are generally more difficult to detect and 
analyze, not only due to their sheer number as compared to 
homozygous variants but also because they are subjected to 
higher false positive and false negative errors. Nevertheless, 
one could still design one of the following experiments to 
elucidate the genetic architecture underlying these diseases, 
depending on the availability of patient cohorts and the effect 
of the disease on reproductive fitness.

Familial cohort

If large families with the disease of interest are available, 
WES should be performed on at least two affected family 
members. In analyzing the results, any shared variants could 
potentially be disease-causing; using linkage data to focus on 
the variants located in linked intervals would greatly reduce 
the number of variants to be considered. A recent example of 
such an approach is a WES study on familial amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (FALS) [6]. The authors recruited two large 
families with FALS and selected two affected members with 
the  greatest  genetic  distance  from  each  family  for  WES. 
Among the rare functional variants that were identified, they 
tested the shared variants for Mendelian segregation among 
affected family members, eventually narrowing their search 
down to a single common gene, PFN1.

Non-familial cohort

When large families with the disease are not readily avai-
lable, one could  perform WES  on  a number  of  unrelated 
patients with similar clinical manifestations and select genes 
that are commonly mutated in the patient cohort. In carrying 

out  such  an  experiment,  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
background mutation burden of the entire human gene set; 
it is possible that the longest genes might contain the highest 
number of rare functional variants and therefore appear to be 
the most interesting. To circumvent such errors in analysis, 
the variant burden of each gene should be normalized using 
data from a control population. In a WES study of pseu-
dohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), the variant burden of 
every gene from 11 unrelated patients was compared against 
that of 699 controls [7]. A single gene that was specifically 
enriched  for  mutations  in  the  patient  set,  KLHL3,  was 
identified (5 variants from 11 patients compared to 2 from 
699 controls, with p-value of 1.1 × 10-8).

Non-inheritable diseases

If  the  disease  phenotype  is  severe  enough  such  that  it 
affects reproductive fitness, one could hypothesize that de 
novo variants－variants that emerged during meiosis of the 
germ  cells  that  are  unique  to  the  offspring－are  directly 
associated  with  the  disease.  These  can  be  detected  by 
performing trio-based WES on the unaffected parents and 
the proband, and variants that are present in the offspring 
only and not in the parents will be called de novo variants. The 
rate of de novo mutations has been shown to be relatively 
stable and affected primarily by paternal age [8]. WES of 
family quartets can also be carried out, where unaffected 
siblings  are  recruited  simultaneously  and  their  de  novo 
mutations  are  compared  against  those  of  the  proband.  A 
series of studies involving autism trios and quartets recently 
demonstrated that rare de novo mutations were associated 
with  the  risk  of  autism  and  identified  multiple  de  novo 
mutations  in  SCN2A,  KATNAL2,  and  CHD8,  implicating 
these genes in the genetic etiology underlying autism [9-11]. 

Common Complex Diseases

The majority of the disease burden that modern societies 
endure  can  be  attributed  to  common  complex  diseases. 
These  diseases  typically  have  both  genetic  and  environ-
mental  causes,  and  they  also  possess  significant  genetic 
heterogeneity, making the identification of disease-causing 
genes  very  challenging.  Traditionally,  the  use  of  linkage 
analysis of families with extreme disease phenotypes  has 
been  somewhat  successful  in  mutation  discovery  [12]. 
However,  these  mutations  are  particular  to  patients  with 
extreme phenotypes and do not explain the pathophysiology 
of  disease  for  patients  in  the  general  population.  Large 
genome-wide association studies of common variants have 
also  been employed  with  limited success;  the  findings  in 
many studies are not robust and only explain a small fraction 
of the disease risk [13]. As a result, greater attention has 

216

been drawn to profiling rare variants with allele frequencies 
of less than 1% in complex diseases.

Taking advantage of WES technology, several large-scale 
projects have been launched. One such example is a project 
led by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to 
discover novel genes underlying cardiovascular disorders. As 
a result of sequencing the exomes of 2,440 individuals, the 
study  reported  an  excess  of  rare  functional  variants  and 
concluded that large numbers of subjects will be required to 
attain  sufficient  power  to  discover  variants  that  are 
significantly associated with the disease traits [14].

Challenges in Analysis 

WES yields extensive lists of genomic variation, and there 
are many important caveats to bear in mind when carrying 
out analysis of such data. In this section, we address the 
potential challenges that the investigators need to consider 
when designing or performing the experiments. 

False Positive and False Negative Calls

Recent  improvements  of  the  WES  technique  in  both 
experimental and bioinformatics pipelines have reduced the 
occurrence of false positive (false variant that is called true) 
and false negative (true variant that is failed to be called) 
variant calls substantially. Currently, we can achieve ~98% 
sensitivity  and  99.8%  specificity  from  exome  sequencing 
data, minimizing the chance of missing any true variants as 
compared to the analysis of SNP array data (data not shown). 
However,  as  mentioned  previously,  it  is  technically  chal-
lenging to detect and evaluate rare heterozygous variants 
because heterozygous variant calling is more susceptible to 
the  technical  errors  and  require  higher  read  depth.  For 
example, at a coverage depth of 4× (i.e., if a base is covered 
by 4 independent reads) and assuming a 1% per-base error 
rate, a homozygous variant will be called if 0 and 4 reads are 
observed  for  the  reference  and  nonreference  alleles  res-
pectively, with a false positive rate of 2 × 10-4. However, if 
both reference and nonreference alleles have 2× coverage, a 
heterozygous variant will be called with a false positive rate 
of 0.34. This presents a particular problem when one con-
siders  the  uneven  coverage  in  WES  resulting  from  dif-
ferential capture efficiencies across the exome. To achieve 
reliable  heterozygous  calling,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to 
achieve sufficient coverage depth across the entire exome so 
as to minimize the number of bases with low coverage. 

Another challenge to analysis is read misalignments; the 
typical length of NGS reads is near or less than 100 bp, and 
even paired reads are subject to being improperly aligned, 
because there are large portions of the human genome where 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  10,  No.  4,  2012

the DNA sequence is highly repetitive and duplicated. In 
fact,  segmental  duplicated  regions,  defined  as  intervals 
larger than 1 kb having a homology >90% with other parts of 
the genome, encompass about 5% of the human genome 
[15].  Hence,  imposing  more  rigorous  filtering  criteria  to 
remove  such  reads,  including  Phred  score  and  mapping 
quality score cutoffs, is essential. 

Population Stratification

The recent, dramatic acceleration in human population 
growth  over  the  last  several  millennia  has  resulted  in  an 
excess  of  rare  variants  in  the  human  genome,  and  these 
variants have not had enough time to be subjected to natural 
selection [14]. Since the identification of disease-associated 
variants consists largely of assessing rare variants, one must 
bear in mind the possibility that a variant of interest could be 
population-specific  and  not  necessarily  disease-causing. 
This is especially problematic if the patient cohort is not of 
European or, more specifically, northwestern European des-
cent. Recent public sequencing projects, such as the 1000 
Genomes Project and NHLBI Go Exome Sequencing Project, 
have  covered  a  greater  variety  of  non-European  ethnic 
groups than before, and they report that these groups harbor 
a greater burden of rare variants as compared to Europeans 
[14, 16]. For example, indigenous African individuals may 
carry  2-3  times  more  rare  variants,  and  East  Asian  indi-
viduals may carry 1.5 times more variants when compared to 
individuals of European descent. Rare variants specific to the 
population  of  study  might  be  easily  mistaken  as  patient-

‘detected’ if the p-value exceeded the genome-wide significance.

enriched  variants;  it  is  thus  necessary  to  screen  the  pre-
sumed variant with carefully matched healthy individuals.

Locus Heterogeneity 

Locus heterogeneity describes the phenomenon where a 
single disease can be caused by multiple different loci across 
different patients. Over the last few decades, studies per-
forming linkage analysis followed by positional cloning have 
identified  many  genes  as  being  responsible  for  various 
inherited diseases; the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
(OMIM) database currently records 3,000 genes as being 
disease-causing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim). 
This also suggests that the majority of the remaining dise-
ases without known associations with genes have not been 
amenable  to  classical  approaches  and  will  likely  display 
extensive genetic heterogeneity. Increasing the size of the 
patient cohort will increase the power to discover variants, as 
shown in Fig. 3. Pathway or gene ontology analyses can also 
be  performed  to  link  the  mutated  genes  into  certain 
functional  categories－there  are  several  publicly  available 
tools for this purpose. A good example of this method is the 
aforementioned  study  on  PHAII－the  authors  initially 
identified KLHL3 from WES of 11 patients and subsequently 
considered KLHL3’s presumed functional partner, CUL3, as a 
potential  gene  candidate.  Extending  the  screening  to  52 
patients,  KLHL3  was  found  to  be  mutated  in  24  patients 
(46.2%) and CUL3 in another 17 patients (32.7%), explai-
ning  a  total  of  78.8%  of  the  entire  patient  set.  Another 
possible approach is to re-evaluate the clinical diagnosis of 
patients in the cohort by correlating subtle differences of 
clinical measurements and genetic variants in order to focus 
the analysis on a more clinically homogeneous set of patients 
as a separate cohort.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that NGS has provided researchers with 
unprecedented  power  to  resolve  the  genetic  etiology  of 
various human diseases. When WES was first introduced, its 
utility was highly debated due to its apparent limitations, 
such as incomplete coverage of functional elements and low 
sensitivity  for  structural  variant  detection.  However,  the 
practical advantages of the technology have made it a favored 
tool  for  researchers,  and  WES  will  likely  continue  to  be 
widely  used  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Furthermore,  as 
library capture methods and data analysis pipelines improve, 
increasing  amounts  of  genomic  information,  aside  from 
single-nucleotide changes and short indels, can be extracted. 
Examples of this include homozygosity interval mapping, 
common SNP genotyping information for various popula-

tion-level analyses, and detection of structural variants [17, 
18]. Finally, the strengths of WES－short turnaround times, 
low cost, and relatively easy data interpretation－make it an 
optimal tool for clinical diagnosis. The increased use of WES 
in the clinic will surely spur the development of personalized 
medicine and reinvent treatment practices in the near future 
[1, 19].
