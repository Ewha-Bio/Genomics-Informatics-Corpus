Abstract
BOD is an FTP service management tool on the Internet. 
It was developed for biological researchers in South Korea. 
It  enables  easier  and  faster  access  of  bioinformation 
without  having  to  go  through  foreign  FTP  sites.  BOD 
includes an automatic downloader with a management 
and email alert service from which the user can easily 
select and schedule any biological database. Once listed 
in BOD, the user can check and modify the download status 
and data from an additional email alert service.

Introduction
Since the completion of the Human Genome Project, the 
amount  and  complexity  of  biological  data  have  been 
increasing  at  exponential  rates  (Dennis  et  al.,  2004, 
Andreas, 2003). Nowadays, the term "biological data," in 
fact, means complex information. It often implies a network 
of databases that need to be downloaded and managed 
constantly due to rapid update rates. In genomics, data 
formats often reflect genome sequences derived from 
automatic experiments and biological chip data such as 
cDNA microarrays and SNP arrays. In the proteomics field, 
data are derived from measures applied to a more complex 
condition:  2D-PAGEs,  mass  spectrometers,  and  3D 
protein structures. Also, data describing such as processes 
as promoter and protein-protein interactions are produced 
by computational predictions. These data collectively form

omics  resources  and  are  deposited  in  various  public 
databases for sharing with other researchers.

However,  there  are  too  many  omics  and  ome 
databases to download, and it is impractical for biologists 
to manage them. Currently, there are several programs for 
downloading  and  managing  biological  data,  such  as 
BioMirror (Gilbert et al., 2004), which is a public service for 
high-speed  access  to  up-to-date  DNA  and  protein 
sequence databanks. However, the user cannot directly 
update  the  download  lists  in  this  service.  In  addition, 
BioDownloader (Shapovalov et al., 2007) is a program for 
easy download and update of files from FTP and http 
servers.  BioDownloader  can  be  installed  on  a  local 
computer  using  either  the  Microsoft  Windows  or  Mac 
operating system.

Since 2003, we have developed a web service tool, the 
Biological Object Downloader (BOD), which easily downloads 
and updates large amounts data from the various FTP 
servers for Korean bioinformatists, biologists, and medical 
scientists. BOD can be used for accessing the newest 
biological data abroad without installing any databases at 
the local computer. BOD was initially designed for local 
database administrators, but it also can be a useful data 
warehouse for end users. BOD mainly aims to automate 
downloads and management of various biological databases. 
BOD not only enables any user to automatically download 
databases,  but  also  notifies  the  user  about  the  latest 
updates of these databases via email. BOD is part of an 
effort to share bioinformation openly and freely. It is a 
daughter  project  of  BioFTP  (http://bioftp.org),  wherein 
global biological information resources can be updated 
and downloaded with maximum convenience. BOD will 
serve as a file download and management branch of the 
biological community cluster (BioCC, Gong et al., 2006).

Results
BOD  is  a  useful  biological  database  download  and 
management system that can be accessed through the 
web. BOD uses the Apache web server with the MySQL 
database. Its main role is to act as a hub of biological 
database downloads for biologists. It is automated and 
effective  for  large-scale  database  handling.  It  serves 
genomic (NCBI, Pruitt et al., 2001; PrimateDB, Woo et al., 
2005),  transcriptomic  (dbEST,  Boguski  et  al.,  1993; 
GAzer, Kim et al., 2007), proteomic (SCOP, Murzin et al.,

2005), interactomic (InterAct, Hermjakob et al., 2004), 
variomic (dbSNP, Sherry et al., 2001; SNP@Ethnos, Park 
et al., 2007; SNP2NMD, Han et al., 2007; D2GSNP, Kang 
et al., 2006; SNP@Domain, Han et al., 2006), and textomic 
(EntrezLink, Maglott et al., 2007) bioinformation. BOD’s 
unique characteristics are the following: 1) it is easily 
accessible through the web, and 2) it notifies new updates 
to users through email. Although it is mainly for local users 
who want to download large databases frequently, BOD 
will be developed as a general omics database management 
system in the future.

General usage and webpage interface
Fig. 1A shows the main page of BOD, found at http://ftp.kobic.kr. 
The red box shows a list of databases that will be updated 

 

when the user accesses the webpage. The blue box shows 
a list of databases updated in the most recent 3 days. When 
the user clicks the data list (e.g., Interpro, NCBI_GENE, 
DBEST) in the blue box, the KOBIC FTP site will be linked. 
“Lastest” is connected to the current directory of the FTP 
site with the latest data. “Detail” shows a specific list of the 
newest data, and each “Detail” is linked to the file via FTP. 
When the user clicks “Download List” on the top left of Fig. 
1A, as in Fig. 1B, all the data lists registered in BOD can 
be seen. Lists with complete downloads and the newest 
data are highlighted in blue and are linked to the FTP 
service.  Lists  that  are  downloading  show  when  the 
download will be completed. The user can click “Daily 
Update Log” from the navigation panel in the side menu 
located on the left to view only the lists with completed 
downloads.

The blue box shows the list of recent updates. (B) Download list shows a list of all the data registered in BOD. The 
data registered on the list but not completely downloaded are shown in black. The lists with the newest data are
shown in blue and are linked to the FTP sites. The list also shows the date of the latest update and the expected 
update  date.  (C)  Email  Registration.  When  the  user  checks  a  database  and  inputs  an  email  address  and 
password, the BOD system notifies the user whenever the checked lists are updated. (D) Download Manager. 
The user can register new target databases for downloading and can modify an existing list.

service for national bioinformation dissemination within 
South Korea. It provides omics bioinformation of such 
entities as the genome, transcriptome, proteome, interactome, 
variome (such as SNP data), and textome (literature). For 
better service, BOD focuses on the synergistic effects in 
operation, by sharing and dividing tasks among biological 
researchers.  BOD’s  unique  characteristics  are  the 
following: 1) it is easily accessible through the web, and 
2) it notifies users of new updates through email. Although 
it is mainly for local users who want to download large 
databases frequently, BOD will be developed as a general 
biological database management system in the future.

information
BOD provides the update status of the data lists for which 
the user has registered through email. To use this service, 
the user should click “Email Registration,” on the upper left 
side of Fig. 1B. New users should register their emails, and 
current users can log in via registered emails and modify 
their lists of database of interests or stop receiving emails. 
To modify lists, the user can log in via email and modify 
the checkboxes of the lists and press the “Alert me by email” 
button, as shown in Fig. 1C. To stop receiving email, 
uncheck any boxes, then BOD will assume the user has 
stopped using its service.

Download Manager
This function targets a public biological database to be 
listed  on  the  KOBIC  FTP  server  through  FTP  or  http 
protocol.  Currently, new lists can  be listed  by  KOBIC 
researchers only. When a user clicks the “LogIn” button 
on the upper right side of the webpage and inputs a user 
name and password, the Download Manager menu of 
BOD is created on the navigation panel on the left side of 
the webpage. When the user clicks on that menu, the 
interface of the Download Manager can be seen. In Fig. 
1D, a registered user is eligible to modify specific details 
of input information. BOD not only classifies a redundant 
database  by  DB  Name,  but  also  checks  whether  the 
database has the Target Path with the same site.

Conclusion
BOD  is  a  web-based,  automatic  biodata  download 
management system. It is automated and effective for 
large-scale database handling. BOD at present is a web
