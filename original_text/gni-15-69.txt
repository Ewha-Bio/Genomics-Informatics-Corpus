In this study, cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) producer isolates genome were compared with genome of pathogenic and 
commensal Escherichia coli strains. Conserved genomic signatures among different types of CDT producer E. coli strains were 
assessed. It was shown that they could be used as biomarkers for research purposes and clinical diagnosis by polymerase 
chain reaction, or in vaccine development. cdt genes and several other genetic biomarkers were identified as signature 
sequences in CDT producer strains. The identified signatures include several individual phage proteins (holins, nucleases, and 
terminases, and transferases) and multiple members of different protein families (the lambda family, phage-integrase family, 
phage-tail tape protein family, putative membrane proteins, regulatory proteins, restriction-modification system proteins, 
tail fiber-assembly proteins, base plate-assembly proteins, and other prophage tail-related proteins). In this study, a sporadic 
phylogenic pattern was demonstrated in the CDT-producing strains. In conclusion, conserved signature proteins in a wide 
range of pathogenic bacterial strains can potentially be used in modern vaccine-design strategies.

Introduction

The co-evolution of pathogenic bacteria and their hosts 
leads to the generation of functional pathogen-host inter-
faces.  Well-adapted  pathogens  have  evolved  a  variety  of 
strategies for manipulating host cell functions to guarantee 
their successive colonization and survival. For instance, a 
group  of  gram-negative  bacterial  pathogens  produces  a 
toxin,  known  as  cytolethal  distending  toxin  (CDT)  [1]. 
Among the vast majority of CDT producers are Escherichia 
coli, which is commonly found in the intestines of humans 
and  other  mammals.  Most  E.  coli  strains  are  harmless 
commensals;  however,  some  isolates  can  cause  severe 
diseases and are designated as pathogenic E. coli. Among the 
various  pathogenic  E.  coli  strains,  some  have  acquired 
virulence determinants through the horizontal transfer of 
genes, such as the cdt genes encoding CDTs. CDTs were the 
first bacterial toxins identified that block the eukaryotic cell 
cycle and suppress cell proliferation, eventually resulting in 
cell death. The active subunits of CDT toxins exhibit features 
of type I deoxyribonuclease-like activity [2, 3]. 

In this study, comparative genome analysis of CDT-pro-
ducer E. coli isolates with other pathogenic and commensal 
strains  was  performed.  Alignments  between  multiple 
genomes  led  to  the  identification  of  a  set  of  distinct 
(“signature”) sequence motifs. These signature sequences 
could  be  used  to  delineate  single  genomes  or  a  specified 
group of associated genomes within a desired group, such as 
the CDT-producing E. coli (the target group in this study). 
While  genomic  signatures  were  conserved  in  the  target 
group, which they  were not  conserved  or  were absent in 
other  related  or  unrelated  genomes  (i.e.,  the  background 
group). From a clinical point of view, conserved signature 
sequences could offer advantages in predicting and further 
designing novel CDT inhibitors to vaccine candidates [4].

On the other hand, phylogenic trees can be constructed 
based on multiple sequence alignments. It is important that 
phylogeny  based  on  an  immense  number  of  genes  and 
whole-genome sequences are more reliable than those based 
on a single gene or a few selected loci [5]. Phylogenic analysis 
can  provide  an  overall  classification  of  the  target  group 
among the background group. Alignment of whole-genome 
sequences yields detailed information on specific differences

between genomes and, consequently, has shed new insights 
into phylogenetic relationships in recent years [6-9].

In this study, phylogenic relationships of CDT＋ strains 
with other pathogenic and commensal E. coli strains were 
assessed, and conserved signature genomic regions in the 
target group (CDT-producers) were annotated. This infor-
mation could be used for developing molecular diagnostics 
assays, polymerase chain reaction primer and probe design 
in modern vaccines.

CDT

 strains

Several databases were used to identify bacterial strains 
harboring cdt genes. Data was extracted from the following 
resources: NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Infor-
mation  GenBank;  EMBL,  European  Molecular  Biology 
Laboratory; DDBJ, DNA Data Bank of Japan; PDB, Protein 
Data Bank; RefSeq, NCBI Reference Sequence Database; and 
UniProtKB, Swiss-Prot Database.

Whole-genome sequences

All genomes analyzed in this study were downloaded from 
the  NCBI  file  transfer  protocol  (FTP)  site  at:  ftp://ftp. 
ncbi.nih.gov/genomes.

created using a fragment size of 200 nucleotides, a step size 
of 100 parameters, and BLASTN, which was optimized for 
highly similar sequences. 

Phylogenic tree construction

A  phylogram  was  produced  in  SplitsTree  4,  using  the 
neighbor-joining method and a distance matrix Nexus file 
exported from Gegenees software [13]. E. albertii TW07627 
and  E.  fergusonii  ATCC  35469  strains  were  set  as  the 
out-groups. 

Identifying conserved signatures 

CDT-producing isolates were set as the target group, and 
all other strains were used as the background group by using 
the in-group setting tab in Gegenees software. Because of the 
genomic diversity in CDT-producer E. coli, we repeated this 
procedure with five different strains, including E. coli 53638, 
E. coli IHE3034, E. coli RN587/1, E. coli STEC B2F1, and E. 
coli  STEC  C165-02,  which  were  defined  as  separate  re-
ference strains.

The biomarker score (max/average) setting was also used. 
Biomarker scores were drawn graphically and loaded into the 
tabular view for further data analysis. In the tabular view, a 
score of 1.0 is the maximum biomarker score and is con-
sidered as a signature.

Reordering of draft genomes

Assembling signature fragments

Ordering  and  orienting  contigs  in  draft  genomes  faci-
litates comparative genome analysis. Contig ordering can be 
predicted  by  comparison  of  a  reference  genome  that  is 
expected  to  have  a  conserved  genome  organization  [10]. 
ProgressiveMauve  (version  2.3.1)  was  used  for  ordering 
contigs in draft genomes. Mauve contig mover (MCM) offers 
advantages over methods that rely on matches in limited 
regions near the ends of contigs [11, 12]. The E. coli K-12 
MG1655 strain (accession No. NC_000913.3) was used as a 
reference genome. 

The MCM optional parameters were used in this study 
including  default  seed  weight,  use  seed  families:  15 
determine  Locally  Collinear  Blocks  (LCBs);  LCBs,  full 
alignment, iterative refinement, sum-of-pairs LCB scoring, 
and min LCB weight: 200. 

Multiple genome alignments

In this study, Gegenees software (version 2.2.1) was used 
for multiple-genome alignments. The software is written in 
JAVA,  and  making  it  compatible  with  several  platforms. 
Limitations  were  not  observed  in  the  speed  calculation, 
number and memory of the genomes that could be aligned. 
Gegenees software is also capable of performing fragmented 
alignments [4]. Multiple alignments of E. coli genomes were 

Several overlapping fragments were obtained, based on 
the  sequences  of  each  reference  strain.  To  facilitate  sub-
sequent  analysis  steps,  the  overlapping  fragments  were 
assembled  using  DNA  Dragon  software,  version  1.6.0 
(http://www.dna-dragon.com/).

The settings were designed with minimum overlaps (100 
bases) along the diagonal length, a minimum %-identity of 
complete  overlapping  fragments,  and  100%  full-search 
parameters.

BLAST 

BLAST  was  done  with  sequences  for  each  of  the  five 
reference  strains  by  using  NCBI  BLASTX  (http://blast. 
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) to identify the putative protein 
domains.  Furthermore,  putative  conserved  domains  were 
also detected. The results were confirmed using the Uni-
ProtKB  Bank  BLASTX  program  (http://www.uniprot. 
org/blast/).

the number of encoded proteins, encoded genes, genome 
type, pathotype, serotype, other characteristics, and acce-
ssion  numbers  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Most  data 
presented were extracted from NCBI GenBank and UniProt 
Bank  and  some  information  was  extracted  from  original 
articles [14, 15]. The genomes of 24 strains were drafted, 
and  a  reordering  process  of  the  draft  genomes  was 
performed. Twenty-five CDT＋ E. coli strains were analyzed, 
including E. albertii TW07627.

Phylogenic analysis 

A  heat-plot  based  on  a  200/100  BLASTN  fragmented 
alignment drawn with Gegenees software is shown in Fig 1. 
A phylogenic overview is also shown in the heat-plot. A more 
detailed  phylogram  was  constructed  with  SplitsTree  4 
software, as shown in Fig. 2. 

CDT-producer E. coli strains were displayed a sporadic, 
phylogenomic  pattern  in  the  heat-plot,  with  a  lack  of  a 
consensus  pattern.  Six  distinct  genomic  groups  of  CDT＋ 
strains (T1 to T6 in Fig. 2) were shown in the phylogram, all 
of which  were  sporadic among  the  strains in Fig  1.  As a 
sporadic pattern of CDT-producing strains was observed in 
the bacterial population in the phylogram for specific clades, 
these strains were related and some degrees of similarity 
were also found.

Signature sequences in the target group 

In total, 1,527 fragments representing 3.0% of the E. coli 
53638-strain  genome  were  identified  as  signature  sequ-
ences. Biomarkers were restricted to 21 highly significant 
regions, designated A to U. When E. coli IHE3034 was set as 
the reference strain, 220 signature sequences (0.4%) were 
detected. Biomarkers were identified in six regions, desig-
nated A to F. However, 1,512 (2.9%) signature fragments 
were obtained, which were restricted to 18 regions (A to R) 
in the genome of E. coli RN587/1 when it was regarded as the 
reference strain. Moreover, 620 biomarker fragments (1.2%) 
were detected in the genome of E. coli STEC B2F1 when it 
was set as the reference strain, 16 biomarker regions (A to P) 
were recognized. In addition, when E. coli STEC C165-02 was 
used as the reference strain, 593 signature fragments (1.1%) 
were identified, which were restricted to eight regions (A to 
H). The signature regions for all reference strains are shown 
in Fig. 3, separately. In addition, the biomarker designation, 
domain description, BLASTX  results  and  related putative 
conserved domains for each reference strain are provided in 
Supplementary Tables 1–6.

fragments  (Table  2).  The  signature  proteins  identified 
included:  CDT,  holin,  lambda-family  proteins,  nuclease, 
phage  integrase  family  proteins,  phage  tail  tape  measure 
family  proteins,  putative  membrane  proteins,  regulatory 
proteins, restriction-modification system proteins, tail fiber 
assembly  proteins,  baseplate  assembly  proteins,  tail  fiber 
protein and other prophage tail related proteins, terminuses 
and transferases. The nucleotide sequences of some proteins 
including anti-termination proteins, prophage DNA packa-
ging  and  binding  proteins,  transposase  and  DNA  tran-
sposition proteins, scaffold proteins, recombination-related 
domains,  putative  phage-replication  proteins,  hemolysin, 
helicase,  glycol  transferase,  and  glycohydrolase  superfa-
milies,  were  detected  as  biomarkers  in  the  target  group, 
although  these  BLASTX  results  were  not  observed  in  all 
reference strains. Presumably, CDT-producer E. coli strains 
possess several hypothetical proteins whose functions are 
not  yet  defined  and  might  be  conserved  proteins.  The 
existence of these DNA biomarker sequences in reference 
strains is clear; however, the related proteins in some strains 
have not been determined.

Significant putative conserved domains and 
superfamilies

In the era of modern vaccines, finding conserved domains 
or epitopes has a great therapeutic value. Putative conserved 
domains were described as non-specific hits (NH), specific 
hits (SH), and multi-domains (MD), and it was shown in 
Supplementary Tables 1–6.

Discussion

The  synchronic  evolution  of  bacterial  pathogens  and 
virulence-associated determinants encoded by horizontally 
transferred genetic elements has been observed in several 

species. However, E. coli is a normal member of the intestinal 
microflora  of  humans  and  animals.  E.  coli  strains  have 
acquired virulence factors by the attainment of particular 
genetic loci through horizontal gene transfer, transposons, 
or  phages.  These  elements  frequently  encode  multiple 
factors that enable bacteria to colonize the host and initiate 
disease development [16]. CDTs belong to one such class of 
virulence-associated factors. CDT was first identified in E. 
coli by Johnson and Lior in 1988 [17]; since then several 
studies have been reported that CDTs can be produced by 
intestinal and extra-intestinal pathogenic bacteria [18]. 

In this study, the genomes of 25 CDT+ E. coli strains were 
acquired  from  several  gene  banks.  Multiple  genome 
–
comparisons with 49 CDT
 E. coli strains, including EPEC 
(enteropathogenic E. coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli), 
STEC  (Shiga  toxin-producing  E.  coli),  EAEC  (enteroagg-

78

regative  E.  coli),  EIEC  (enteroinvasive  E.  coli),  AIEC 
(adherent  invasive  E.  coli),  UPEC  (uropathogenic  E.  coli), 
ExPEC (extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli), EHEC (entero-
hemorrhagic E. coli), environmental strains and commensal 
strains were performed. 

In  fact,  phylogenic  analysis  based  on  whole-genome 
information is more accurate than those based on one gene 
or  a  set  of  limited  genes.  In  this  study,  CDT-producing 
strains  were  not  shown  a  phylogenomic  relationship  or 
pattern. Indeed, while they might carry the same or similar 
virulence gene sets, they also possess their own divergent 
genomic  structures.  This  is  probably  because  of  their 
complex and distinct evolutionary pathways, indicating an 
independent acquisition of mobile genetic elements during 
their evolution. 

The sporadic  pattern  in  the  phylogenomic  dendrogram 
confirmed  previous  findings  that  CDT＋  strains  are  hete-
rogeneous.  The  heterogeneous  nature  of  CDT-producing 
strains might arise from horizontal gene transfer through 
mobile genetic elements. These genetic exchanges that occur 
in bacteria provide genetic diversity and versatility [19].

A significant  challenge  in  comparative  genomics is  the 
utilization  of  large  datasets  to  identify  specific  sequence 
signatures that are biologically important or are useful in 
diagnosis [4, 20]. In this study, we define CDT-producing E. 
coli  as  the  target  group  and  found  regions  that  were 
conserved that could serve as genomic signatures for the 
target group. Because of the heterogeneous genomic nature 
of CDT＋ E. coli, five reference strains were selected instead of 
one, including EIEC, ExPEC, EPEC, STEC B2F1, and STEC 
C165-02.  Moreover,  in  the  phylogenomic  overview,  these 
five reference strains were selected from different clades of 
the phylogenic tree, representing the T1–T6 groups.
The findings was presented in this study indicate that the 
major conserved biomarkers beyond CDT were exonuclease, 
phage integrase, putative membrane, and tail-fiber proteins. 
Furthermore, with signature proteins of a targeted group, it 
was shown that phage-related proteins and virulence-asso-
ciated  factors  could  be  commonly  transferred  by  phages. 
Moreover, in the putative conserved domains of biomarker 
proteins,  phage-related  superfamilies  were  frequently 
observed. As a result, cdt genes were used as a signature 
sequences in CDT-producing E. coli strains, and it was shown 
that they can be used as a powerful biomarker.

In this study, the most significant signature proteins in the 
five E. coli strains were identified using in-silico whole-ge-
nome  sequences.  It  was  demonstrated  that  conserved 
signature  proteins  were  expressed  in  a  wide  range  of 
pathogenic bacterial strains, which could be used in future 
studies  in  a  broad  range  of  research  applications  and  in 
modern vaccine-design strategies.
