Early detection and proper management of kidney rejection are crucial for the long-term health of a transplant recipient. 
Recipients are normally monitored by serum creatinine measurement and sometimes with graft biopsies. Donor-derived 
cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) in the recipient’s plasma and/or urine may be a better indicator of acute rejection. We 
evaluated digital PCR (dPCR) as a system for monitoring graft status using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)–based 
detection of donor DNA in plasma or urine. We compared the detection abilities of the QX200, RainDrop, and QuantStudio 
3D dPCR systems. The QX200 was the most accurate and sensitive. Plasma and/or urine samples were isolated from 34 kidney 
recipients at multiple time points after transplantation, and analyzed by dPCR using the QX200. We found that donor DNA 
was almost undetectable in plasma DNA samples, whereas a high percentage of donor DNA was measured in urine DNA 
samples, indicating that urine is a good source of cfDNA for patient monitoring. We found that at least 24% of the highly 
polymorphic SNPs used to identify individuals could also identify donor cfDNA in transplant patient samples. Our results 
further showed that autosomal, sex-specific, and mitochondrial SNPs were suitable markers for identifying donor cfDNA. 
Finally, we found that donor-derived cfDNA measurement by dPCR was not sufficient to predict a patient’s clinical condition. 
Our results indicate that donor-derived cfDNA is not an accurate predictor of kidney status in kidney transplant patients.

Introduction

Kidney  transplantation  is  a  necessity  for  patients  who 
have non-recovery of kidney function. Transplant patients 
usually  have  a  high  risk  of  complications  in  the  early 
post-operative period (3–6 months) [1]. Diagnoses of kidney 
dysfunction include acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, 
glomerulonephritis,  calcineurin  inhibitor  toxicity,  and 
non-specific injury. Early diagnosis and treatment are very 
important  for  a  patient’s  long-term  health.  Biopsy  and 
measurement  of  creatinine  levels  are  standard  ways  to 
monitor patients [2]. The disadvantage of using biopsies is 
that they cause injury to the kidney, and can cause secondary 
complications.  The  disadvantage  of  measuring  creatinine 

levels is that this is a low specificity assay. For these reasons, 
noninvasive diagnostic tools that can outperform the current 
standard transplantation monitoring system are needed. It 
has been reported that total cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid 
(cfDNA) or donor-derived cfDNA in plasma or urine can be 
used  as  a  potential  biomarker  for  the  early  detection  of 
kidney dysfunction after transplantation [3-7]. Several di-
fferent cfDNA quantification techniques have been inves-
tigated for use in examining cfDNA as biomarker of acute 
rejection. These techniques include quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) using Y-chromosome genes [1], digital 
PCR (dPCR) using Y-chromosome genes [8, 9] or single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [10], and massive parallel 
shotgun  sequencing  using  SNPs  [8,  11].  Several  studies 
reported that dPCR was especially cost-effective, rapid, and

sensitive for quantifying circulating donor DNA in plasma or 
urine samples from transplant patients [9, 10, 12]. However, 
it is still not clear whether dPCR can be used in a clinic to 
accurately monitor the conditions of transplanted organs. In 
this study, we evaluated dPCR-based kidney transplant re-
cipient  monitoring  by  measuring  the  levels  of  circulating 
donor-derived cfDNA in patient plasma and/or urine.  

Methods
Patients

As a pilot test, genomic DNA and cfDNA were isolated 
from three different pairs of donor and recipient samples 
(blood, plasma, and urine) collected at Asan Medical Center. 
For clinical sample screening using SNP-based dPCR, the 
blood (n = 72), plasma (n = 72), and urine (n = 69) samples 
were collected from a total of 34 kidney transplant recipients 
with different clinical conditions at Kyung Hee University 
Hospital at Gangdong. Patient were stable, or experiencing 
acute rejection, acute tubular necrosis, glomerulonephritis, 
calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity, or suffering from non-specific 
injury.  The  study  protocols  were  approved  by  the  Insti-
tutional Review Board of the Asan Medical Center and Kyung 
Hee  University  Hospital  at  Gangdong.  Written  informed 
consent was obtained from all patients. 

Preparation of genomic DNA and cfDNA for dPCR

Blood  was  centrifuged  at  1,800  ×g  for  10  minutes  to 
separate the buffy coat from the plasma. The buffy coat was 
used to isolate genomic DNA using a Qiagen DNA blood 
mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). According to standard 
protocols, genomic DNA was eluted using 200 μL of elution 
buffer. Plasma (1 mL) and urine (3 mL) were centrifuged at 
11,000 ×g for 3 min, and 1,800 ×g for 10 min, respectively, 
to remove cells. cfDNA was isolated from plasma and urine 
using a Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid kit and eluted using 
50 μL of elution buffer. DNA was stored at –20°C. 
Selection of donor-specific SNP markers

In order to differentiate donor DNA from recipient DNA, 
SNP markers were selected from a panel of SNPs used for sex 
determination or identification of individuals [13]. A total of 
seven  highly  polymorphic  mitochondrial  DNA  (mtDNA) 
SNPs  were  also  selected  from  mtDB  (http://www.mtdb. 
igp.uu.se/) and in-house Korean mtDNA variant data, and 
were  used  to  detect  donor-specific  mtDNA  in  patient 
samples. We designed several TaqMan probe sets to detect 
each of two alleles in our dPCR screen using the fluorescent 
dyes FAM and VIC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA).

dPCR experiments

Initially, three different dPCR systems (QX200, Bio-Rad, 
Hercules,  CA,  USA;  RainDrop,  RainDance  Technologies, 
Billrica,  MA,  USA;  QuantStudio  3D,  Life  Technologies, 
Carlsbad, CA, USA) were tested to compare their sensitivity 
and  accuracy  using  SNP  rs543840  (A/G)  with  10  ng  of 
control genomic DNA having one of three known genotypes 
(AA,  AG,  or  GG).  For  the  quantification  of  cfDNA  in 
transplant  patient  plasma  and  urine,  the  Bio-Rad  QX200 
dPCR  system  was  used  with  3.5  μL  of  isolated  sample 
cfDNA.  All  reactions  were  prepared  using  the  manufac-
turer’s standard protocol (Bio-Rad). Each reaction contained 
10 μL of 2× ddPCR Supermix for Probes (Bio-Rad), 1 μL of 
40× TaqMan Probe (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 3.5 or 5 μL 
of  cfDNA  (1:20  diluted  cfDNA  in  the  case  of  mtDNA 
detection) as template, and the distilled water necessary to 
reach a total reaction volume of 20 μL. Droplets were gene-
rated using the QX200 droplet generator (Bio-Rad) accor-
ding  to  the  manufacturer’s  protocols.  The  PCR  cycling 
conditions were 95oC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 
94oC for 30 s and 60oC for 60 s, with a final 10-min incu-
bation at 98oC. Droplets were read in the QX200 droplet 
reader, and analyzed using the QuantaSoft software, version 
1.6.6 (Bio-Rad). We measured the positive counts of each 
allele directly, or the calculated counts of each allele based on 
a  Poisson  distribution.  These  values  were  then  used  to 
express the minor allele (donor DNA) counts as a percentage 
of the total DNA counts. In case of homozygous donors (two 
A alleles) and recipients (two B alleles), the donor DNA 
counts and percentages were easy to calculate because the 
donor DNA counts were simply the positive counts of the A 
allele. However, in case of heterozygous donors (A and B 
alleles)  and  homozygous  recipients  (two  B  alleles),  the 
corrected donor DNA counts were calculated by doubling 
the total positive counts of the A allele, whereas the corrected 
recipient  DNA  counts  were  calculated  by  subtracting  the 
total positive counts of the A allele from the total positive 
counts of the B allele. Finally, the donor DNA percentage was 
calculated as the corrected donor DNA counts divided by the 
total positive DNA counts, multiplied by 100. 

Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 18 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The level of statistical signi-
ficance (p) was calculated with a student’s t test or ANOVA 
test to compare clinical subgroups of transplant patients, 
such  as  stable  and  acute  rejection.  Pearson’s  correlation 
coefficients (r) were also calculated to compare SNP marker 
types to detect donor cfDNA. Linkage between highly poly-
morphic mitochondrial SNP markers were examined with

Results
Evaluation of SNP detection in genomic DNA by 
three dPCR instruments

Prior to using dPCR to detect donor DNA in transplant 
patient cfDNA samples, we tested the performance of three 
different  dPCR  instruments  (Bio-Rad  QX200,  RainDance 
RainDrop,  and  Life  Technologies  QuantStudio  3D)  using 
control genomic DNA samples with three different geno-
types of a SNP (rs543840) (sample 1, AA; sample 2, AG; 
sample 3, GG) (Fig. 1). The Bio-Rad QX200 system had the 
highest counts and best genotype clustering in all samples. 
The RainDrop system had a high false-positive rate in the 
homozygous samples (sample 1, 1.19%; sample 3, 17.75%), 
and an unequal allelic ratio (A:G = 1:3) in the heterozygous 
sample (sample 2). The QuantStudio 3D system gave clear 
clustering in the heterozygous sample (sample 2) but gave 
weak clustering (sample 1) and high false positive counts 
(sample 3) in the homozygous samples. Therefore, among 
the three dPCR systems tested in this study, the Bio-Rad 
QX200 system had the best performance in detecting SNPs 
in  control  genomic  DNA  samples.  The  Bio-Rad  QX200 
dPCR system was thus chosen for dPCR screening of trans-
plant patient cfDNA samples. 

Selection of highly polymorphic autosomal and 
mitochondrial SNPs as donor-specific DNA markers

Several studies have used genetic signature detection of 
transplanted organs based on SNPs [8, 10, 15, 16]. However, 
it is still not clear how many SNPs should be genotyped for 
accurate  detection  of  donor-specific  DNA  in  transplant 
patients.  In  this  study,  we  tested  the  ability  of  27  highly 
polymorphic  SNPs  used  for  human  identification  to  dis-
tinguish donor-specific DNA from paired transplant patient 
DNA.  To  determine  the  appropriate  number  of  SNPs  for 
donor-specific DNA detection, we screened the genotypes of 
the 27 SNPs, and the genotypes of two additional sex-spe-
cific SNPs used for sex determination (AMEL-1 & ZF-1). 
The genomic DNA of three kidney donor and recipient pairs 
was analyzed by capillary sequencing (Table 1). In the case of 
a transplant between unrelated individuals (patient 1, wife 
to  husband),  among  27  markers,  11  donor-specific  SNPs 
(five homozygous and six heterozygous alleles; 40.7%) were 
identified. However, in case of transplants between related 
individuals (patient 2 and patient 3, both cases are trans-
plants from mother to daughter), seven and six heterozygous 
SNPs (25.9% and 22.2% of alleles tested) were detected as 
donor-specific markers, respectively (Table 1). These data 
indicate that using approximately 24% of the highly poly-
morphic  SNPs  used  to  identify  individuals  would  be 
sufficient to detect donor-specific DNA in transplant moni-
toring, even in transplants between related individuals.

The detection of nuclear DNA is not easy due to limited 
amounts of donor DNA in plasma or urine cfDNA samples.

However, high copy numbers of the mitochondrial genome 
are usually present in cfDNA samples. In order to identify 
candidate mtDNA variants as donor-specific DNA markers, 
we selected 19 highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs with 
high minor allele frequency (MAF ＞ 0.20) at mtDB (http:// 
www.mtdb.igp.uu.se/)  and  one  in-house  mtDNA  variant 
data with MAF ＞ 0.30 (n = 24 Korean DNA samples). For 
the  detection  of  donor-specific  DNA  in  plasma  or  urine 
cfDNA samples after transplantation, a total of seven highly 
polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs were finally selected based 
on having high MAFs (＞ 0.2) in additional Korean DNA 
samples (n = 38), and following exclusion of three tightly 

linked variants (linkage with r2 = 1) (Table 2).

kidney transplant recipient with acute tubular necrosis at 
day 18 after transplantation. Using any of the three SNPs, we 
were able to detect circulating donor DNA in urine cfDNA 
samples,  but  not  in  plasma  cfDNA  samples  (Fig.  2).  As 
shown in Fig. 2, limited amounts of donor-specific DNA 
(0%–0.25% of total DNA) were detected in plasma cfDNA 
samples,  whereas  high  amounts  of  donor-specific  DNA 
(56%–74%  of  total  DNA)  were  detected  in  urine  cfDNA 
samples  using  all  three  SNP  markers.  Thus,  our  results 
indicate that plasma cfDNA is not appropriate for kidney 
transplant monitoring, but urine is a very good source of 
cfDNA for monitoring kidney transplant patients. Further-
more,  using  the  sex-specific  and  autosomal  SNPs  led  to 
identification of a very similar percentage of donor-specific 
DNA (57% vs. 56%). On the other hand, a higher percentage 
of  donor-specific  DNA  (74%)  was  detected  using  the 
mtDNA SNP as a marker (Fig. 2). We also observed a strong 

correlation  between  the  mtDNA  and  nuclear  DNA  SNPs 
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.57–0.83) as well as 
between sex-specific and autosomal SNPs (r = 0.90, p = 
0.0007) in a comparison of multiple sample tests (Fig. 3). 
These results indicate that dPCR can be useful for SNP-based 
detection of donor DNA in the urine of kidney recipients 
following transplantation. 

Evaluation of dPCR screening of clinical samples from 
kidney transplant recipients

To  investigate  the  clinical  validity  of  dPCR  for  kidney 
transplantation monitoring, we screened a total of 34 kidney 
transplant patients’ urine cfDNA samples collected at multiple 
time points after transplantation. Among the 34 patients, we 
selected  11  patients  based  on  TaqMan  probe  (Applied 
Biosystems,  Foster  City,  CA,  USA)  availability  to  detect

counts, and the percentage of the total positive DNA counts 
that were from donor DNA (Fig. 4). In a pilot test, limited 
amounts  of  donor-specific  DNA  were  detected  in  plasma 
cfDNA samples (mean, 1%; range, 0% to 10%). Conversely, 
in  urine  cfDNA  samples,  a  large  percentage  of  the  total 
positive DNA counts were from donor DNA (mean, 55%; 
range, 6% to 100%). However, the differences in both total 
positive DNA counts, and donor DNA percentages, were not 
significant between clinical groups (Fig. 4). We next tested 
whether circulating mtDNA could be used to monitor graft 
status in transplant patients. We measured the circulating 
mtDNA  levels  in  plasma  and  urine  cfDNA  samples  from 
kidney transplant patients, using the mitochondrial variant 
marker  mtDNA_12705.  We  found  that  the  circulating 

mtDNA levels of transplant patients likewise could not be 
used to distinguish the clinical conditions of the patients 
(data  not  shown).  The  donor-specific  cfDNA  in  urine 
samples was not consistent with the graft pathology, or the 
results  of  serum  creatinine  analysis  (Fig.  5).  Plasma 
donor-specific  DNA  was  not  detected  in  most  cases,  but 
when detected it was also inconsistent with graft function 
and patient status. These results indicate that SNP-based 
dPCR detection of donor DNA is not a useful diagnostic for

function, and patient survival, following kidney transplan-
tation  [17].  Therefore,  monitoring  for  kidney  rejection  is 
very important. The standard for monitoring kidney trans-
plant patients is to regularly check serum creatinine levels 
[2]. Assessment of graft function can be supplemented with 
a  surveillance  graft  biopsy,  but  the  role  of  this  invasive 
procedure  in  monitoring  stable,  un-sensitized  patients  is 
debatable.  These  methods  have  drawbacks  including  low 
specificity and injury, respectively. Many researchers have 
tried to develop alternative or supplementary methods for 
monitoring  transplant  recipients.  One  of  the  promising 
methods of monitoring for graft rejection is dPCR [9, 10, 
12]. However, it is still not clear whether dPCR is accurate 
enough to use for the monitoring of the clinical conditions of 
transplant patients. Thus, in this study, we evaluated noni-
nvasive dPCR based measurement of donor DNA levels in 
patient plasma and urine as a technique for determining the 

clinical conditions of kidney transplant patients. 

dPCR is a sensitive and cost-effective method to quantify 
circulating nucleic acids in samples with a high background 
of homologous sequences [18]. We initially compared three 
dPCR  instruments  (QX200,  RainDrop,  and  QuantStudio 
3D) using control genomic DNA samples with known geno-
types.  The  Bio-Rad  QX200  dPCR  system  had  the  best 
performance  coupled  with  accurate  DNA  quantification 
(Fig.  1).  The  Bio-Rad  QX200  droplet  digital  PCR  uses 
emulsion chemistry to partition 20 μL nucleic acid samples 
into  approximately  20,000  oil-encapsulated  nanodroplets 
to  produce  data  with  high  sensitivity  [19].  On  the  other 
hand, the RainDrop and QuantStudio 3D dPCR systems had 
high false positive rates and inaccurate genotype clustering 
(Fig. 1). The QX200 dPCR system robustly detected high 
copy numbers of donor-specific cfDNA within kidney trans-
plant patient urine cfDNA samples, but not plasma cfDNA

samples. These results indicate that urine is a reliable source 
of cfDNA that can be analyzed by dPCR to determine the 
levels of donor-specific cfDNA following kidney transplan-
tation.  The  weak  detection  of  donor-derived  cfDNA  in 
plasma samples was likely due to the high background of 
recipient DNA from hematopoietic cells [16, 20]. Next-ge-
neration sequencing methods can be used with plasma DNA 
samples for transplant monitoring with good performance 
[8] because next-generation sequencing has better detection 
power than dPCR [21]. However, next-generation sequen-
cing is difficult and expensive to use in a clinical setting. 
Preamplification  of  cfDNA  by  PCR  is  another  option  to 
enrich  the  cfDNA  isolated  from  plasma  prior  to  dPCR 
screening, and this approach has been used in a previous 
study [10]. 

Highly  polymorphic  SNPs  can  be  used  to  detect  do-
nor-specific DNA in transplant recipients. Some researchers 
have used Y-chromosome markers to identify and measure 
donor DNA in gender-mismatched transplantations [9, 21, 
22]. Also, many studies have used SNPs to determine the 
percentage  of  donor-derived  cfDNA  with  dPCR  [10]  or 
next-generation  sequencing  [8].  In  this  study,  we  used 
highly  polymorphic  nuclear  SNPs  that  had  been  used  for 
identifying  individuals  [13]  to  detect  and  measure  donor 
DNA.  We  evaluated  multiple  SNPs,  including  autosomal, 
sex-specific, and mitochondrial SNPs. Highly polymorphic 
autosomal SNPs were excellent for identifying donor-spe-
cific DNA variants. As shown in Table 1, as few as 24% of the 
autosomal SNPs used for human identification are needed 
for donor DNA identification, even in transplants between 
related individuals. In addition, we confirmed that mtDNA 
markers  are  ideal  for  donor-specific  DNA  detection  in 
circulating  cfDNA,  although  they  cannot  be  used  when 
transplants  occur  between  family  members  of  the  same 
mitochondrial lineage. Another issue when using mtDNA 
SNPs as markers in transplantation monitoring is the limited 
availability of highly polymorphic mitochondrial SNPs, and 
the  high  linkage  between  these  SNPs  (Table  2).  Further-
more, as shown in Fig. 2, the percentage of mtDNA that was 
donor-derived  in  urine  did  not  match  the  percentage  of 
nuclear DNA that was donor-derived. It has been reported 
that  mtDNA  concentration  is  highly  affected  by  the 
blood-processing protocol [23], and no correlation was also 
observed  between  the  levels  of  circulating  mtDNA  and 
genomic DNA in previous studies [24, 25]. Therefore, mtDNA 
markers may not be better than autosomal SNPs for trans-
plantation monitoring because the donor-derived mtDNA 
levels  in  plasma  and  urine  may  vary  widely  between 
transplant patients, depending on the cell types involved in 
different  pathological  conditions.  We  also  found  that 
sex-specific  SNPs  were  as  useful  as  autosomal  SNPs  to

monitor transplanted organ status in cases of gender-mi-
smatched transplantation, particularly when the donors are 
male (Fig. 2). 

In kidney transplantation patients, very limited numbers 
of donor DNA were detected in plasma, whereas sufficient 
numbers  of  donor  DNA  were  detected  in  urine  samples. 
Therefore,  for  the  detection  of  donor  DNA  in  kidney 
transplantation, we think that minimum number of DNA 
copies  is  10  copies  and  100  copies  for  plasma  and  urine 
samples, respectively. In this study, we found that urine was 
a  much  better  source  of  cfDNA  than  plasma,  because  it 
contained higher copy numbers of DNA. This observation is 
consistent with previously published findings [9, 22, 26]. 
Plasma donor-derived cfDNA levels might also be correlated 
with  the  size  of  grafted  organ.  Even  when  stable,  liver 
transplant patients showed higher levels of donor-derived 
cfDNA than kidney or heart transplantation patients [10]. 
Because of the limited amount of donor-specific cfDNA in 
blood, a plasma sample might not be suitable for detecting 
subtle  injuries  to  the  grafted  kidney.  In  contrast,  urine 
contains sufficient amounts of donor-specific cfDNA, even 
in patients with no abnormal pathology. Perhaps not sur-
prisingly, given the massive tubular network, 2,000–7,000 
cells are detached from this system daily and can be collected 
in urine [27]. Degradation of detached tubular cells could be 
a source of urinary cfDNA. Our results show that the mean 
percentage  of  cfDNA  that  was  donor-specific  cfDNA  was 
53.3%  (range,  21%  to 92%)  in patients  with  stable  graft 
function and no pathological abnormalities. We can assume 
that half of the urinary cfDNA originated from the kidney, 
whereas the other half might be derived from the urinary 
tract. Our hypothesis was that a damaged or rejected graft 
would  have  shown  increased  excretion  of  donor-specific 
cfDNA, and this would be detected in the urine. However, in 
clinical sample screening, although dPCR accurately detec-
ted donor-specific DNA in urine cfDNA samples, we could 
not  find  any  statistically  significant  difference  between 
patients with different clinical conditions. The amount of 
urinary cfDNA was highly variable, even in stable patients, 
and was not correlated with graft pathology or function. We 
think that multiple factors, such as patient age, body weight, 
time after operation, clinical complications, and variability in 
sample preparation could contribute to the high inter-pa-
tient differences in cfDNA levels. Consistent with our re-
sults, high inter-patient variation in cfDNA has been also 
demonstrated in a previous kidney transplantation study [9].
In  conclusion,  noninvasive  monitoring  of  the  levels  of 
donor-specific  cfDNA  is  possible,  and  is  a  promising  ap-
proach  to  tracking  graft  status  and  detecting  clinical 
conditions such as acute rejection. However, due  to  high 
inter-patient variation, and the complexity of patient cfDNA

samples, accurate prediction of a patient’s clinical condition 
is currently not possible. Therefore, further optimization of 
donor-derived cfDNA measurement by dPCR is necessary 
before  this  technique  can  be  implemented  clinically  for 
noninvasive monitoring of kidney transplant recipients.
