Editor’s Introduction to This Issue

This is a special issue featuring several review articles in 
the area of metagenomics. The advancement of next-gene-
ration  sequencing  technology  expedites  metagenomics, 
which profiles the population of species in an environment. 
Prof. Jihyun Kim at Yonsei Univerisity invited three reno-
wned metagenomics researchers to write review articles. In 
the  first  one,  a  group  headed  by  Prof.  Hana  Yi  at  Korea 
University  College  of  Medicine,  Seoul,  Korea  surveys 
databases and analysis tools in metagenomics. The second 
review article by Prof. Seon-Woo Lee’s team at Dong-A Uni-
versity, Busan, Korea focuses on soil-borne microorganisms 
with  particular  emphasis  on  their  potential  as  sources  of 
novel biological activities. The last review by Prof. Jin-Woo 
Bae and colleagues at Kyung Hee University, Seoul, Korea 
discusses viral metagenomes in a variety of environmental 

samples. In addition, we feature four more articles that were 
winners of outstanding prizes for this year’s KOGO Young 
Researchers  Best  Paper  Award.  Three  of  them  deal  with 
genome-wide association studies using Korea Association 
Resource (KARE) data. For example, Dr. Kyung-Won Hong 
at Korea National Institute of Health, Cheongwon, Korea 
reports risk variants associated with orthostatic hypotension 
and their functional implications. The last awardee is Ms. 
Yun-Jeong  Kwon  from  Prof.  Heui-Soo  Kim’  lab  at  Pusan 
National University, Busan, Korea. She reports the SINE- 
VNTR- Alu elements, a retrotransposon, in relation to asso-
ciated functional genes. 

We hope you enjoy this issue and appreciate your con-

tinued support.
