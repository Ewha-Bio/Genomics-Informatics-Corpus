The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) gene may determine individual susceptibility to adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) in the central nervous system (CNS) by limiting brain access of antiepileptic drugs, especially valproic acid (VPA). Our 
objective was to investigate the effect of ABCC2 polymorphisms on ADRs caused by VPA in Korean epileptic patients. We 
examined the association of ABCC2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms  and haplotype frequencies with VPA related to adverse 
reactions. In addition, the association of the polymorphisms with the risk of VPA related to adverse reactions was estimated 
by logistic regression analysis. A total of 41 (24.4%) patients had shown VPA-related adverse reactions in CNS, and the most 
frequent symptom was tremor (78.0%). The patients with CNS ADRs were more likely to have the G allele (79.3% vs. 62.7%, 
p = 0.0057) and the GG genotype (61.0% vs. 39.7%, p = 0.019) at the g.‒1774delG locus. The frequency of the haplotype 
containing g.‒1774Gdel was significantly lower in the patients with CNS ADRs than without CNS ADRs (15.8% vs. 32.3%, p 
= 0.0039). Lastly, in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the presence of the GG genotype at the g.‒1774delG locus 
was identified as a stronger risk factor for VPA related to ADRs (odds ratio, 8.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 70.17). We 
demonstrated that ABCC2 polymorphisms may influence VPA-related ADRs. The results above suggest the possible use-
fulness of ABCC2 gene polymorphisms as a marker for predicting response to VPA-related ADRs.

Introduction

Various forms of epilepsy are among the most common 
serious  brain  disorders  and  present  through  convulsion, 
autonomic movement, impaired consciousness, and more 
[1].  These  neurological  disorders  affect  an  estimated  42 
million people of all ages worldwide [2]. The blood-brain 
barrier (BBB) has challenged the treatment of epilepsy, since 
many  antiepileptic  drugs  (AEDs)  are  not  effectively  dis-
tributed to the vascular endothelium or, accordingly, to their 
targets in brain [3, 4]. The BBB, thought to be the first-line 
barrier to the disposition of drug from the blood to the brain 
[5], consists of the interplay of three major microvascular 
components. Tight junctions between the endothelial cells 
constitute  the  major  permeability  barrier.  The  overall 
biology of the barrier is shaped by the interactions between 

the endothelium and the pericytes/smooth muscle cells and 
the astrocyte foot processes that cover most of the abluminal 
surface of the microvasculature [6]. 

Drug pharmacokinetics is controlled by drug transporters, 
which regulate drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. 
Drug transporters are considered a second-line barrier for 
limiting drug disposition from the blood to the brain [7]. In 
brain  capillary  endothelial  cells,  multidrug  resistance 
protein 1 (MDR1); multidrug resistance-associated protein 
1  (MRP1),  MRP2,  MRP4,  and  MRP5;  and  breast  cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP) are among the many drug trans-
porters that might be expressed at the luminal side of the 
membrane [5, 8, 9]. MRP2, in particular, is over-expressed 
(about  225%  greater)  in  drug-refractory  temporal  lobe 
epileptic  patients  with  hippocampal  sclerosis  (HS)  [5, 
10-12]. Drug reactions can be different between individuals

between the two groups.

Demographic characteristics of the epileptic patients are 
presented in Table 1. DNA from control subjects (n = 110) 
was  randomly  selected  from  the  DNA  bank  of  the  Korea 
Pharmacogenomics  Research  Network  at  Seoul  National 
University. Blood samples were collected from each subject, 
and DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit 
(Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany).

Genetic analysis

Polymorphisms of the MDR1, MRP, and BCRP genes in the 
Korean population were discovered by denaturing gradient 
gel  electrophoresis,  two-dimensional  gene  scanning,  and 
direct PCR using methods similar to those described in a 
previous paper [24]. Genotype screening of each locus in 
control  and  epileptic  patients  was  performed  by  the

with the same AED blood concentrations and therapeutic 
levels, because drug distribution is influenced by variable 
levels of drug transporters. MRP2 is thought to play a more 
important  role  in  the  distribution  of  AEDs  than  other 
transporters  in  the  epileptic  brain  [13].  MRP2  has  been 
demonstrated to transport many AEDs, including valproate 
(VPA), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PHT), and more 
[9, 14-17]. Valproic acid has become established as one of 
the  most  widely  used  AEDs  in  the  treatment  of  both 
generalized and partial seizures in adults and children and is 
considered to be a substrate of MRP2 [9, 14-17]. Probenecid, 
an  inhibitor  of  MRPs,  has  been  shown  to  increase  the 
concentration of valproic acid in the brain [18]. In animal 
‒
models,  TR
  rats  (MRP2  knockout)  have  lower  VPA  and 
VPA-glucuronide  in  their  bile  than  control  Wistar  rats 
(which intrinsically express MRP2) [19].

Functional  polymorphisms  in  genes  encoding  drug 
transporters can alter AED uptake, cerebral distribution, and 
efflux, resulting in individual differences in AED concen-
tration and effectiveness and/or the occurrence of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs). Many functional single-nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported. For example, 
mRNA  expression  of  the  c.1446CG  MRP2  genotype  was 
recently revealed to be higher than the c.1446CC genotype in 
the  liver  [20].  In  addition,  the  c.2302C  ＞ T  (exon  18, 
Arg768Trp)  mutation  is  responsible  for  Dubin-Johnson 
syndrome  [21, 22]. The c.2302C  ＞ T and c.4348G  ＞ A 
genotypes correlate with significantly lower MRP2 protein 
expression levels compared to wild-type and V417I [21]. The 
c.1249G ＞ A mutation significantly reduces the amount of 
MRP2  mRNA  in  human  preterm  placentas  [23].  The  g.‒
1774delG  polymorphism  has  been  linked  with  toxic 
hepatitis  by  our  group  [24].  In  the  present  study,  we 
investigated the association between the g.‒1774delG MRP2 
genotype and ADRs of the central nervous system (CNS) in 
VPA treatment groups.

Methods
Subjects

This  retrospective  study  included  168  epileptic  Korean 
patients who received VPA at Sinchon and Gangnam Seve-
rance  Hospitals.  Forty-one  patients  demonstrated  VPA 
dose-related ADRs in the central nervous system (dizziness, 
headache,  somnolence,  diplopia,  dysarthria,  tremor,  etc.), 
while the remainder (n = 127) did not. Patients who were 
diagnosed  with  chronic  active  epilepsy,  West  syndrome, 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, progressive myoclonic epilepsy, 
tuberous sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, hamartoma, or 
brain tumors were excluded. There were no statistical dif-
ferences in age, sex, response/non-response, and sclerosis

Statistical analysis

Haploview  software  (version  3.2)  was  used  to  design 
MRP2  haplotype  constructs  and  analyze  major  or  minor 
haplotypes based on a standard expectation-maximization 
algorithm. Allele and genotype frequencies of transporter 
polymorphisms were assessed using chi-square tests (ver-
sion 11.5 for Windows; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). 

Logistic regression
The strength of the association between dose-related CNS 
ADR patients and the presence of the G allele at the g.‒1774 
region was evaluated as the odds ratio (OR) obtained with 
logistic regression analysis (SPSS version 11.5). ORs were 
adjusted for gender, age, HS, use of AEDs (larmotrigene, 
CBZ, PHT, and topiramate), and the presence of the G allele 
at the g.‒1774 promoter region. 
Cell culture

SH-SY5Y (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), a human brain 
neuronal cell line originated from a neuroblastoma, was a 
gift  from  Dr.  In  Suk  Kim,  Yonsei  University  College  of 
Medicine,  Seoul,  Korea.  SH-SY5Y  cells  were  maintained 
with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 
1% PS (100 units penicillin, 100 μg streptomycin, Gibco, 
Grand  Island,  NY,  YSA)  and  were  cultured  under  pre-
confluent monolayer conditions in 100-mm-diameter poly- 
d-lysine-coated culture dishes at 37oC with 5% humidified 
CO2.

Plasmid preparation of MRP2 promoter
A pGL3 basic vector containing the human MRP2 pro-
moter region (about 2.3 kb, ‒2314 to +348 relative to the 
translation initiation site) was constructed by our group in a 
previous  study  from  homozygotic  persons  with  MRP2 
haplotypes 1, 2, and 3 [24]. The g.‒1774delG polymorphism 
is located in haplotype 1, and the g.‒24C ＞ T polymorphism 
is located in haplotype 3. The reporter vector of a minor 
haplotype variant containing only the g.‒1549G ＞ A varia-
tion was constructed using mutagenic primers, introducing 
a ‒24 T → C change to the plasmid of haplotype 3 containing 
both g.‒1549G ＞ A and g.‒24C ＞ T variations. Haplotype 2 
includes no polymorphism (wild-type). In short, a total of 
five clones were prepared: pGL3 basic; haplotypes 1, 2, and 3; 
and g.‒1549A alone.

Dual luciferase assay

The pGL3 basic vector containing WT MRP2 promoter 
variants was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells to measure the 
activity  of  the  MRP2  promoter  with  and  without  VPA 
(P4543; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The day before 
transfection,  0.2  ×  106  SH-SY5Y  cells  were  seeded  in  a 
12-well plate in order to reach 90‒95% confluence at the time 
of transfection; 1.6 μg of pGL3-MRP2, including the variants 
and  mock,  was  added  to  wells  with  Lipofectamine  2000 
(Invitrogen).  Vector-containing  Renilla  luciferase  was  co- 
transfected in order to confirm the transfection efficiency of 
the pGL3-MRP2 vector. After a 3- to 5-h incubation, cells 
were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Invitro-
gen) and incubated at 37oC with 5% humidified CO2 for 24 
h. Reporter activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase 
Reporter  Assay  system  (Promega  Corporation,  Madison, 
WI, USA). After removing the growth medium, cells were 
washed with PBS, and the plates were placed on a rocking 
platform shaker with 250 μL of 1 × passive lysis buffer per 
well for 15 min. Lysates were transferred to an e-tube, and 
luciferase binding was performed with 50 μL LARII and 10‒
50 μL cell lysate in a 96-well assay plate (Costar; Corning 
Incorp., Corning, NY, USA). After 10 s, light emission was 
measured  using  a  luminometer  (Berthold  Technologies, 
Wildbad, Germany), and Stop & Glo was added to each well 
to stop firefly luciferase activity and evoke Renilla luciferase 
activity.

Results
SNP association with drug response or resistance

Drug resistance was defined as the occurrence of at least 
four seizures over the year before recruitment, with trials of 
more  than  three  appropriate  AED,  at  maximal  tolerated 
doses,  based  on  the  occurrence  of  clinical  side  effects  at 
supra-maximal doses [25]. The patients were classified as 
either responsive or resistant to drug therapy. We did not 
find any significant associations between the selected drug 
transporter SNPs and either group.

Clinical characteristics of epilepsy patients

A total of 41 (24%) epileptic patients had ADRs of the 
CNS, and 127 (76%) epileptic patients did not (non-ADR). 
The demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1. The 
gender frequency, drug response, and the average age of drug 
use  between  the  two  groups  were  similar.  (p  ＞ 0.05) 
Subjects without ADRs used fewer drugs than those with 
ADRs (p = 0.039). The most frequent symptom out of 14 
types of ADRs to VPA use was tremors (78.0%). Based on 
logistic  regression,  ADRs  were  more  likely  to  occur  in

patients with g.‒1774delG (presence of G allele), which had 
the highest OR (9.10) among the considered factors (p ＜ 
0.05).

Genetic polymorphisms of MRP2 in the Korean 
population
MRP  polymorphisms  covering  all  MRP2  exons,  exon- 
intron junctions, and the promoter region up to ‒2.3 Kb from 
the  translation  initiation  site  have  been  described  in  the 
Korean  population  [24].  We  investigated  11  of  the  poly-
morphisms  from  previous  studies  in  110  healthy  control 
people and 168 epileptic patients. We found four promoter, 
four exonic, and three intronic polymorphisms among them.

Relationship between genotypes of MRP2 and CNS 
ADRs to VPA

Allele frequencies of the MRP2 polymorphisms are shown 
in Table 2. Non-ADR patients were more likely to have the 
deletion  allele  instead  of  the  G  allele  at  g.‒1774  when 
compared with patients with CNS ADRs (p = 0.0057; ADR, 
20.7%; non-ADR, 37.3%). The frequency of the T allele at 

Table  2.  Allele  frequencies  of  the  MRP2  polymorphisms

g.‒24 was higher in patients with CNS ADRs than those 
without (p = 0.0274; ADR, 34.1%; non-ADR, 22.0%). The 
difference between the groups based on g.‒24C ＞ T frequen-
cies was not significant after Bonferroni’s correction, while 
the difference based on g.‒1774delG frequencies remained 
significant.

The  genotype  frequencies  of  each  polymorphism  are 
shown in Table 3. Genotype frequency distributions were 
consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (each p ＞ 0.5). 
The  ADR  group  patients  were  more  likely  to  have  a  GG 
genotype than a deldel genotype at g.‒1774delG compared to 
the non-ADR group (p = 0.023, homo GG and deldel p = 
0.0146). The TT and CT genotype frequencies at g.‒24C ＞ T 
were  higher  in  patients  with  CNS  ADRs  than  non-ADR 
patients (p = 0.035, hetero CT → TT p = 0.019). 

The frequencies of haplotypes present in at least 10% of 
the population are presented in Table 4. Haplotype fre-
quencies of the MRP2 polymorphisms at all site. The fre-
quency of haplotype 1 was significantly higher in patients 
without CNS ADRs (32.3%) than those with ADRs (15.8%) 
(p = 0.0039). The frequency of haplotype 3 was higher in

patients with CNS ADRs than those without (p = 0.0139), 
but this difference was no longer significant after Bonfer-
roni’s correction was applied. 

Measurement of MRP2 promoter activity

VPA stimulated MRP2 promoter activity about 10-fold. 
The  epileptic  patients  with  ADRs  of  the  CNS  had  less 
haplotype  1  (containing  g.‒1774del)  than  the  epileptic 
patients with no ADRs. By inference, the g.‒1774G allele, a 
major allele of the MRP2 promoter sequence, was associated 
with  ADRs  of  the  CNS  in  patients  treated  with  VPA. 
Epileptic patients with g.‒1774del instead of g.‒1774G were 
more likely to be resistant to VPA-related ADRs, probably 
because  the  g.‒1774del  allele  produced  higher  MRP2 
promoter  activity  than  g.‒1774G,  leading  to  more  MRP2 
proteins  in  the  brain  tissue  after  VPA  treatment.  The 
presence of more MRP2 affected the distribution of AEDs 
(especially VPA) from the blood to the brain, resulting in the 
appearance of VPA-related ADRs in patients with g.‒1774G 
rather than g.‒1774del. Our luciferase assay data supported 
this hypothesis. There was no difference in luciferase activity 
between g.‒1774del and the others (g.‒1774G, g.‒24C＞T, g.
‒1549G ＞ A) with non-VPA treatment. Luciferase activity 
was different, however, following 3 mM VPA treatment; g.‒
1774del promoter (haplotype 1) activity was 134% higher 
than g.‒1774G promoter (haplotype 2) activity (n = 5; p ＜ 
0.05  by  t-test).  Further,  the  g.‒1774del  MRP2  promoter 
increased 1,014% with 3 mM VPA treatment compared to 
non-VPA treatment. However, the g.‒1774G MRP2 promoter 
also increased 816% with 3 mM VPA treatment compared to 
non-VPA  treatment.  The  change  of  g.‒1774G  → del  in-
creased the expression of MRP2 in neuronal SH-SY5Y cells 
treated with 3 mM VPA (Fig. 1). 

Factors influencing ADRs to VPA

Many factors, including gender; age; treatment with CBZ, 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

lamotrigine, PHT, or topiramate; and HS, did not influence 
ADRs. The presence of the genotype G/G at the g.‒1774 
region of the MRP2 promoter influenced ADRs to VPA in 
epileptic patients. Logistic regression showed that the G/G 
correlated independently with ADRs to VPA (p ＜ 0.05; OR, 
9.102;  95%  confidence  interval,  1.111  to  73.378).  The 
del/del allele was the reference category (Table 5). The G/G 
genotype  at  g.‒1774  might  influence  lower  expression  of 
MRP2 than del/del in the brain, leading to ADRs. 

Discussion

The selective cellular barrier controlling drug delivery into 
the brain has been identified by the over-expression of MRP2 
in  capillary  endothelia,  astrocytes,  and  neuronal  cells  in 
previous studies [5, 26, 27]. In this study, we found that the 
g.‒1774del genotype in the promoter region up-regulated 
the expression of MRP2. Patients with g.‒1774del showed 
resistance to ADRs by increasing the expression of MRP2, 
followed by a decrease of drug concentration in the brain. 
Our  data  supported  this  hypothesis  and  verified  an 
association between g.‒1774delG and ADR.
The difference of luciferase activity between g.‒1774G and 
g.‒1774del  in  neuronal  SH-SY5Y  cells  was  not  large. 
However, they showed extensive differences by statistical 
analysis (p ＜ 0.05 by t-test). Because the expression level of 
MRP2  is  lower  in  brain  neuronal  tissue  than  in  hepatic 
tissue, even a little change is thought to be important. The 
luciferase  assay  of  MRP2  promoter  activity  has  not  been 
conducted in brain capillary endothelial cells yet. In this cell 
line,  SNP  function  is  thought  to  be  more  effective,  since 
MRP2 is more highly expressed in endothelial cells than in 
neuronal cells [28].

In  reality,  if  MRP2  and  other  transporters  are  over- 
expressed in the brain, most patients should be not only 
non-ADR but also resistant to drug therapy. However, allele 
and genotype frequencies of g.‒1774delG were not different 
between drug-resistant and drug-responsive patients (p ＞ 
0.05). The absence of a strict definition of drug-resistant 
epilepsy  may  have  weakened  the  statistical  analysis.  The 
selected grouping was only a foundation for retrospective 
chart review. If the definition was stricter－for example, at 
least one seizure per year or non-seizure over the year－the 
different  frequencies  of  g.‒1774delG  within  each  group 
would have been more significant. An accurate study design 
and definitions are a key part of effective pharmacogenomic 
studies  [2].  Standards  for  association  studies  in  pharma-
cogenomics have been presented in previous studies [2].
In spite of the retrospective study design, an association 
with g.‒1774delG was noticeably significant. This SNP was 
reported previously in our group in relation to toxic hepatitis 
[24]. In that study, the g.‒1774del genotype caused lower 
expression of MRP2 than g.‒1774G in a human hepatocyte- 
originated cell line (HepG2). This finding is contrary to the 
results  of  the  present  study.  There  are  different  known 
transcription  factors  in  hepatocytes  and  neuronal  and 
endothelial cells. The promoter activity in the cells trans-
fected with a g.‒1774G (haplotype 2) clone was about 100 
times stronger than those transfected with the control vector 
in hepatic cells. A strong transcriptional activator is present 
in hepatocytes. However, the difference in promoter activity 
between g.‒1774G and mock control was lower in neuronal 
SH-SY5Y  cell  lines.  Neuronal  transcription  factors  are 
expected to be weaker than those in hepatocytes. The bind-
ing sequence is “AAAAACAACAAGATAA” (the underlined 
C  is  the  anti-sense  sequence  at  g.‒1774G).  Transcription 
factors that are known to bind this sequence are GATA-1, 
Evi-1, FOXO, HNF3, and more (Genomatix software GmbH). 
Each tissue-specific transcription factor binds this sequence 
and  induces  different  levels  of  MRP2  expression.  For 
example, HNF3, a common activator in hepatocytes, was 
thought to activate MRP2 expression through binding with 
g.‒1774G  rather  than  g.‒1774del.  Consequently,  the  ex-
pression of MRP2 of g.‒1774del would be lower than g.‒
1774G. In contrast, if neuronal cell transcriptional activators 
were more likely to bind g.‒1774del over g.‒1774G, neuronal 
expression of MRP2 of g.‒1774del would be higher than g.‒
1774G. The factors that bind to this region have yet to be 
determined. Previous studies have referred to the different 
binding  factors  of  this  region  in  human  coronary  artery 
smooth muscle cells without specific identification.

In the present study, a luciferase assay demonstrated that 
VPA  stimulated  the  activity  of  the  MRP2  promoter  in 
SH-SY5Y  cells.  VPA  is  a  well-known  histone  deacetylase 

(HDAC) inhibitor that induces apoptosis in cancer cells [29, 
30]. In normal cells, however, VPA activates chromosomal 
transcriptional ability by inhibiting HDAC. Chromosomal 
DNA forms a compact nucleosome with histone proteins 
and needs to be unpacked in order to start transcription. 
HDAC removes the acetyl group in acetyl-lysine residues 
and biologically inhibits the activity of transcription [31]. In 
neuronal  SH-SY5Y  cells,  VPA  could  activate  the  MRP2 
promoter  by  inhibiting  HDAC.  MRP2  has  farnesoid  X 
receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), and peroxisome pro-
liferator-activated receptor/RXR binding regions. VPA inte-
racts with these proteins and regulates the expression level 
of MRP2 protein [32, 33].

P-gp  polymorphisms  have  repeatedly  been  associated 
with  drug  response  in  epilepsy  [25,  34-37].  Up  to  now, 
however,  the  only  functional  studies  of  MRP2  have  been 
conducted in a knockout animal model [38]. This report is 
the first investigation to show an association between MRP2 
polymorphisms and ADRs in epilepsy. These results may be 
useful in tailoring AED medication. The G allele of the MRP2 
promoter  was  associated  with  ADRs  to  VPA  in  Korean 
epileptic patients. The del allele of MRP2 protected the brain 
against adverse effects of VPA by over-expressing MRP2 in 
brain neuronal cells. These data will help design therapy to 
minimize ADRs in epileptic patients and aid in the develop-
ment  of  new  AEDs.  However,  further  independent  repli-
cation  studies  are  needed  to  unequivocally  confirm  the 
association.
