Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito borne pathogen, belongs to Flaviviridae family having a positive-sense single-stranded RNA 
genome, currently known for causing large epidemics in Brazil. Its infection can cause microcephaly, a serious birth defect 
during pregnancy. The recent outbreak of ZIKV in February 2016 in Brazil realized it as a major health risk, demands an 
enhanced surveillance and a need to develop novel drugs against ZIKV. Amodiaquine, prochlorperazine, quinacrine, and 
berberine are few promising drugs approved by Food and Drug Administration against dengue virus which also belong to 
Flaviviridae family. In this study, we performed molecular docking analysis of these drugs against nonstructural 3 (NS3) 
protein of ZIKV. The protease activity of NS3 is necessary for viral replication and its prohibition could be considered as a 
strategy for treatment of ZIKV infection. Amongst these four drugs, berberine has shown highest binding affinity of –5.8 
kcal/mol and it is binding around the active site region of the receptor. Based on the properties of berberine, more similar 
compounds were retrieved from ZINC database and a structure-based virtual screening was carried out by AutoDock Vina in 
PyRx 0.8. Best 10 novel drug-like compounds were identified and amongst them ZINC53047591 (2-(benzylsulfanyl)-3-cy-
clohexyl-3H-spiro[benzo[h]quinazoline-5,1'-cyclopentan]-4(6H)-one) was found to interact with NS3 protein with binding 
energy of –7.1 kcal/mol and formed H-bonds with Ser135 and Asn152 amino acid residues. Observations made in this study 
may extend an assuring platform for developing anti-viral competitive inhibitors against ZIKV infection.

Introduction

Zika virus (ZIKV), belongs to family “Flaviviradae” having 
genus  “Flavivirus”  [1],  is  a  mosquito-borne  flavivirus.  It 
transmits mainly through vectors from the Aedes genus and 
monkeys  [2].  Humans  get  infected  by  infected  mosquito 
bites or by direct contact probably during sexual intercourse 
[3]. Symptoms associated with the viral infection are fever, 
mild  headache,  malaise,  conjunctivitis,  rashes,  and 
arthralgia. The illness by ZIKV is usually not much severe 
and there is a long-term symptoms for more than a few days 
to a week after infected by mosquito. As the mortality rate of 
ZIKV infection is very rare with less severe sickness, many 
people might not realize they have been infected. There is an 
augmented  risk  of  microcephaly  development  along  with 
severe fetal brain defects in the fetus of pregnant women 

when she infected with ZIKV [4]. In 1947, the ZIKV was first 
isolated from the blood of a sentinel rhesus monkey number 
766  living  in  Zika  forest  at  Uganda  [2].  In  2007,  ZIKV 
spreads from Africa and Asia to cause the largest outbreak in 
humans on Pacific island of Yap [5]. There are around 73% of 
yep residents over the age of 3 years were infected with ZIKV 
whereas no deaths were subjected [5, 6].

The  viral  illness  become  apparent  disease  due  to  the 
increasing  distribution  area  of  ZIKV,  confirming  by  the 
recent  epidemic  French  Polynesia,  new  Caledonian  since 
October 2013 [7] and crook island in March 2014. In May 
2015,  the  Pan  American  Health  Organization  and  World 
Health Organization (WHO) issued an epidemiological alert 
to ZIKV infection [8]. Brazilian health officials confirm a 
case of ZIKV infection transmitted by transfused blood from 
an infected donor in February 2016. There are two types of 
diagnosis for ZIKV are available, one is the detection of the

virus  and  viral  components  through  reverse  transcription 
polymerase chain reaction, immunoassay and virus isolation 
and  the  other  one  is  based  on  the  antibody  detection 
extracted by ZIKV infection [6]. A preliminary diagnosis is 
also carried out based on patients clinical features, place and 
date of travel and activities. Laboratory diagnosis is generally 
able by testing serum or plasma to detect virus.

ZIKV  consist  of  a  single  stranded,  positive  sense, 
5'-capped RNA with genome size of around 11 kb which 
immediately released into the cytoplasm following by cell 
entry [9]. There are 59 and 39 un-translated regions along 
with only one open reading frame which codes a polyprotein 
that further cleaved into three structural proteins i.e., the 
capsid (c), envelope (E) and premembrane/membrane (prM); 
and  seven  nonstructural  (NS)  proteins  i.e.,  NS1,  NS2A, 
NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 [10]. Among them the 
NS3  and  NS5  proteins  play  a  central  role,  together  they 
harbor most of the catalytic activities needed for capping and 
replication  [9].  The  NS5  consist  of  an  N-terminal  me-
thyl-transferase  (NS5  MTase)  domain,  c-terminal  RNA 
dependent, RNA polymerase (NS5 RdRp). Whereas NS3 is 
a  multi-domain  protein  with  an  N-terminal  NS3pro  and 
c-terminal fraction containing the RNA triphosphatase (NS3 
RTpase) and RNA helicase (NS3 hel) activities involves in 
viral  RNA  synthesis  [11-13].  The  375  kDa  flaviviral 
polyprotein precursor is processed by host proteases and a 
virus encoded protease activity localized at the N-terminal 
domain of NS3. Whereas at the junctions prM-E, C-prM, 
NS4A-NS4B,  E-NS1  [14,  15],  and  likely  also  NS1-NS2A 
[16],  is  carried  out  by  the  host  signal  peptidase  located 
within the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, the left over 
peptide bonds between NS2B-NS3, NS2A-NS2B, NS3-NS4A, 
and  NS4B-NS5  are  cleaved  by  NS3Pro.  Cleavage  at  the 
NS2B/NS3 site is carried out in cis but is not essential for 
protease activity [17, 18]. Thus, the protease activity of NS3 
protein is very essential for viral replication and its inhibition 
has to be  evaluated as a  valuable approach  for  treatment 
against flaviviral infections [9]. Thus, the NS3 protein may 
be considered as important drug target. Currently, there is 
no  medicines  and  vaccines  developed  against  ZIKV  or 
specific  antiviral  treatment  for  clinical  ZIKV  infection. 
Treatment  is  normally  supportive  and  can  include  rest, 
intake of fluids, and use of antipyretics and analgesics [19].
There  are  some  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA) 
approved drugs such as: amodiaquine [20], prochlorperazine 
[21], quinacrine, and berberine [22], were reported to be 
effective (in vitro or in vivo) against dengue virus (DENV) 
which is also a Flavivirus. There are many things that dengue 
and Zika have in common like they both are mosquito borne 
viruses spread especially by the Aedes mosquito. Both have 
similar symptoms. The difference is that ZIKV symptoms 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  14,  No.  3,  2016

last for few days or weeks and then they subside but for 
dengue the fever last for weeks and that can further lead to 
bruising  and  bleeding.  Both  dengue  and  Zika  have  three 
structural proteins and seven nonstructural. Quinacrine is 
also active against Ebola virus [23]. As ZIKV also belong to 
the  Flaviviradae  family,  these  drugs  may  have  some 
therapeutic effect against ZIKV. Thus in this study, we have 
taken  these  four  FDA  approved  drugs  against  DENV  as 
ligands and performed molecular docking analysis against 
NS3 protein of ZIKV in order to observe the binding affinity 
of these drugs. Among these four drugs, the drug showing 
minimum binding energy has been considered as the lead 
drug for further analysis. Further, drug like compounds with 
similar physiochemical properties of the lead drug, have been 
retrieved from ZINC database for virtual screening against 
NS3 protein, in order to identify novel drugs for ZIKV. 

Methods
Hardware and software

The study was carried out on Dell Workstation with 2.26 
GHz processor, 6 GB RAM and 500 GB hard drive running in 
Windows operating system. Bioinformatics software, such 
as  PyRx  0.8  [24],  Phyre2  [25],  AutoDock  Vina  [26]  and 
online  resources  like  NCBI  [27],  ProCheck  at  RCSB 
validation  server  [28],  ProSA-web  [29],  ZINC  database 
(https://zinc.docking.org), ProQ [30], ERRAT server [31], 
etc. were used in this study.

Protein structure prediction and validation of drug 
target

The sequence of NS3 protein (accession No. YP_009227202) 
of  ZIKV  was  retrieved  from  NCBI  database  [27].  Phyre2 
servers predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a 
protein  sequence  using  the  principles  and  techniques  of 
homology modeling. Because the structure of a protein is 
more conserved in evolution than its amino acid sequence, a 
protein sequence of interest (the target) can be modeled with 
reasonable accuracy on a very distantly related sequence of 
known  structure  (the  template),  provided  that  the 
relationship between target and template can be discerned 
through sequence alignment. Phyre2 was used for modelling 
the 3D structure of NS3 protein, it is a suite of tools available 
on the web to predict and analyze protein structure, function 
and mutations. The focus of Phyre2 is to provide biologists 
with  a  simple  and  intuitive  interface  to  state-of-the-art 
protein  bioinformatics  tools  [29].  The  refined  model 
reliability  was  assessed  through,  ProSA-web,  the  ProSA 
program (Protein Structure Analysis) is an established tool 
which has a large user base and is frequently employed in the 
refinement and validation of experimental protein structures

[29], and ProQ is a neural network based predictor that based 
on a number of structural features predicts the quality of a 
protein model [30]. Further the refined model was verified 
by ERRAT server, ERRAT is a program for verifying protein 
structures determined by crystallography. Error values are 
plotted as a function of the position of a sliding 9-residue 
window.  The  error  function  is  based  on  the  statistics  of 
non-bonded  atom-atom 
in  the  reported 
structure [31].

Ligand preparation and molecular docking

Chemical structures of ligands (amodiaquine, prochlor-
perazine, quinacrine, and berberine) used in this study were 
retrieved from the PubChem database [32]. PDBQT files of 
ligands and receptor molecules (NS3) was prepared. Then 
the protein-ligand docking studies were performed using the 
AutoDock Vina program [26]. It is one of the widely use 
method 
for  protein-ligand  docking.  AutoDock  Vina 
significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding 
mode predictions. For the input and output, Vina uses the 
PDBQT molecular structure file format. Here PDBQT file of 
four drugs were taken as ligand and PDBQT file of NS3 was 
taken as protein. These drug compounds were docked with 
NS3 protein of ZIKV and NS3 protein of DENV around its 
important binding site residues such as His51, Asp75, and 
Ser135.

Virtual screening

Virtual  screening  is  now  well-known  as  an  efficient 
prototype for filtering compounds for drug discovery. It was 
carried out using PyRx 0.8 (Virtual Screening Tools). All the 
drug-like compounds retrieved from ZINC database in SDF 
format in a single file. The SDF file was imported in open 
babel of PyRx and further energy minimization of all the 
ligands were performed followed by conversion of all the 
ligands  into  AutoDock  PDBQT  format.  Further,  these 
ligands were subjected to docking against NS3 protein of 
ZIKV using AutoDock Vina in PyRx 0.8 [26]. 

Results and Discussion

The NS3 protein (accession No. YP_009227202) of ZIKV 
has 617 amino acids  residues and  NS3 protein  of  DENV 
(accession No. NP_740321.1) has 618 amino acid residues 
in its protein sequence. The NS3 protein of both ZIKV and 
DENV have structurally similar with three conserve domain, 
i.e.,  FLAVIVIRUS_NS3PRO,  Flavivirus  NS3  protease 
(NS3pro) domain; HELICASE_ATP_BIND_1, superfamilies 
1  and  2  helicase  ATP-binding  type-1  domain;  and 
HELICASE_CTER, superfamilies 1 and 2 helicase C-terminal 
domain (predicted from ScanProsite tool of ExPASy) [33]; 

however, there are 67% identities and 100% similarities in 
their amino acid sequences obtained from BLASTP result 
[34].

Protein structure modeling and validation

Three-dimensional structure of both NS3 proteins (Fig. 
1A)  were  modeled  using  Phyre2  server  which  has  taken 
chain  A  of  2VBC  (crystal  structure  of  the  NS3  protease- 
helicase from DENV) as template for modeling having 100% 
confidence and 67% identity. From the ProCheck analysis 
obtained from Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1B), it was observed 
that 88.8% residues were located in most favorable region, 
9.8% were in additional allowed region, 0.4% residues in 
generously allowed regions whereas 0.9% of the residues 
located in disallowed region. The compatible Z score value of 
–10.71  (Fig.  1C)  obtained  from  ProSA-web  evaluation 
revealed that the modelled structure is fit within the range of 
native conformation of crystal structures [29]. Further, the 
overall residue energies of NS3 was largely negative (Fig. 
1D).  The  modelled  NS3  protein  of  ZIKV  showed 
Levitt-Gerstein  (LG)  score  of  5.060  by  Protein  Quality 
Predictor (ProQ) tool, it implies the high accuracy level of 
the predicted structure and taken to account as extremely 
good model. The ProQ LG score of more than 2.5 is needed 
to proposing a predicted structure is of very good quality 
[30].  By  using  ERRAT  plot  same  assumptions  were 
achieved, where the overall quality factor is 67.002%. All of 
the  above  out  comes  recommended  the  reliability  of  the 
proposed model.

Protein-ligand docking

Different  studies  have  already  reported  that  the 
nonstructural  NS3  protein  is  very  essential  for  the 
development of the viral polyprotein and is a suitable target 
for designing antiviral inhibitors [32]. Analysis of the amino 
acid  sequence  of  the  NS3  protein  of  hepatitis  C  virus 
suggested  that  this  viral  protein  contains  a  trypsin-like 
serine protease domain that functions in the processing of 
the  viral  polyprotein  [35].  NS3 protein of  ZIKV  contains 
catalytic triad of His51, Asp75, and Ser135 [9]. The active 
site of serine proteases in variably contains three residues, 
histidine,  aspartate,  and  serine  that  maintain  the  same 
relative spatial position in all the known structures of these 
enzymes.  Thus,  we  performed  molecular  docking  of  four 
FDA approved drugs using AutoDock Vina [26] around the 
active site residues of NS3 protein of both ZIKV and DENV. 
From the docking analysis, it was observed that among all 
the drugs berberine showed the lowest binding energy in 
both ZIKV and DENV of –5.8 kcal/mol and –6.6 kcal/mol 
respectively. In ZIKV, berberine has formed hydrogen bond 
with  Ser135  (Fig.  2).  Likewise  other  three  drugs,  i.e.,

amodiaquine, prochlorperazine, and Quinacrine also docked 
with NS3 protein of both ZIKV and DENV with considerable 
binding energy (Table 1). From ZIKV protein-ligand docking 
we  select  the  ligand  having  lowest  binding  energy  then 
proceed for screening to get more similar drug like com-
pounds.

Virtual screening and validation of docking results

The virtual screening technique is an economical, reliable 
and  time  saving  method  for  screening  large  set  of  lead 
molecules. In our study, we have used PyRx 0.8 [24] for 
screening lead molecules against NS3 protein was used to 
solve the purpose. The NS3 protein of ZIKV was used as 
receptor  to  screen  4,121  drug-like  compounds  (small 
molecules)  based  on  properties  of  berberine  such  as 
molecular weight of 336.367 g/mol, Xlog p-value of 0.20, net 
charge  of  1,  rotatable  bonds  2,  polar  surface  area  41Å2, 
hydrogen donor 0, hydrogen acceptor 5, apolar desolvation 
8.91  kcal/mol,  and  polar  desolvation  of  8.91  kcal/mol. 
Further, an approximate range molecular weight ranges from

NS3, the docking pose for each ligand was selected.

Top ten drug like compounds (Table 2) obtained by virtual 
screening bound to catalytic site of NS3 protein with lowest 
binding  energy  were  taken  as  promising  candidates  for 
further analysis. All the ligand molecules observed to follow 
the Lipinski’s rule of five (molecular weight not more than 
500 Da; hydrogen bond donor not more than 5; hydrogen 
bond acceptors not more than 10; log p-value not greater 
than  5).  The  chemical  structure  of  these  ten  compounds 
along with known inhibitor berberine are given in Fig. 3.

All  the  proposed  lead  molecules  were  observed  to  form 
hydrogen bonds with active site residues of NS3 protein (Fig. 
4). The Lead 1 molecule is ZINC53047591(2(benzylsulfanyl)- 
3-cyclohexyl-3H-spiro[benzo[h]quinazoline-5,1'-cyclopent
an]-4(6H)-one); having molecular weight 456.64218 (g/mol) 
showed the lowest binding of –7.1 kcal/mol and observed to 
interact with active site residues of NS3 by forming hydrogen 
bonds  with  SER135  and  ASN152.  The  other  nine  lead 
molecules  are  also  observed  to  inhibit  NS3  protein  with 
significant lower binding energy as compared to berberine. 
Thus, the higher binding affinity of selected lead molecules 
compared  to  berberine  in  respective  docking  complexes 
proposed  that  the  selected  ligands  would  probably  bind 
more competitively in the active site of NS3 protein (Table 2).
The  participation  of  selected  lead  molecules  have  very 
important role to inhibit the NS3 protein through hydrogen 
bonding  interaction  with  its  active  site  residues  justified 
them as possible inhibitors against the important enzyme of 
ZIKV. Therefore, the given inhibitors may be demonstrated 
through biochemical assays.

In conclusion, the ZIKV belongs to Flaviviridae family, 
which is similar to DENV, West Nile virus and yellow fever 
virus. Currently, there are no specific drugs for prevention 
and treatment of ZIKV. As, the NS3 protein of this virus 
perform a central part in the viral life cycle, it is of appreciable 
interest in designing new potential drug candidate to deal 
with  conquer  the  challenges  of  ZIKV  infection.  A  high 
quality  3D  structure  of  NS3  protein  was  predicted  and 
validated  through  computational  approach  and  molecular 
docking technique was employed to observe the interaction 
of the existing drugs used against other flavivirus, against 
ZIKV NS3 protein. Further, for identifying novel inhibitors, 

high-throughput virtual screening approach was employed 
in this study, would be of significant in designing new drugs 
for ZIKV infection.
