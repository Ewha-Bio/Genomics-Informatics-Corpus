Studying biological networks, such as protein-protein interactions, is key to understanding complex biological activities. 
Various  types  of  large-scale  biological  datasets  have  been  collected  and  analyzed  with  high-throughput  technologies, 
including DNA microarray, next-generation sequencing, and the two-hybrid screening system, for this purpose. In this review, 
we focus on network-based approaches that help in understanding biological systems and identifying biological functions. 
Accordingly,  this  paper  covers  two  major  topics  in  network  biology:  reconstruction  of  gene  regulatory  networks  and 
network-based applications, including protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and network-based genome- 
wide association study.

Introduction

Network  representations  have  been  used  to  describe 
interactions between entities of interest in various areas. In 
particular, network representations are useful to analyze and 
visualize complex biological activities. Global patterns in a 
large-scale complex system can be shown by representing 
the  entities  and  their  interactions  with  nodes  and  edges, 
respectively.  For  instance,  Schwikowski  et  al.  [1]  created 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to predict novel 
protein functions in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using 
the network representations, it was found that 2,358 among 
2,709  total  interactions  compose  a  single  large  network. 
Also,  biological  pathway  databases,  such  as  Kyoto 
Encyclopedia  of  Genes  and  Genomes  (KEGG)  [2]  and 
Reactome [3], provide numerous pathways that are repre-
sented by networks with nodes of molecules and directed 
edges  of  their  actions.  In  addition,  various  mathematical 
properties and models of a network have been developed in 
graph  theory.  Several  reviews  [4-6]  have  illustrated  the 
mathematical properties and topological characteristics of a 
network with biological systems.

The advance of high-throughput technologies, including 

DNA microarray [7], next-generation sequencing [8], and 
the two-hybrid screening system [9], has led to the large- 
scale  datasets  in  genomics  and  proteomics,  which  are 
referred  to  as  ‘omics’  data.  These  omics  data  have  been 
collected and organized to identify biological functions. This 
paper focuses on biological network analysis related to omics 
data, such as gene expression levels and PPIs. We first report 
several major public interaction databases for the omics data 
and then introduce two major topics in  network biology: 
reconstruction  of  gene  regulatory  networks  (GRNs)  and 
network-based applications, including protein function pre-
diction,  disease  gene  prioritization,  and  network-based 
genome-wide association study.

Network Resources

 Experimental  results  from  high-throughput  technolo-
gies, such as the two-hybrid screening system for detecting 
interactions  between  biological  molecules,  have  formed 
various  types  of  network  datasets  that  are  released  and 
updated in public databases on the web. These databases 
commonly  enable  web-based  searches  and  provide  raw 
datasets of pairs of molecules. In this review, we report 11

useful public databases for PPIs and transcriptional regu-
latory  interactions  (Table  1)  [10-20].  For  PPIs,  BioGRID 
[13], MIPS [11], and STRING [16] are the most frequently 
used to predict protein functions for PPIs. BioGRID provides 
496,761  non-redundant  PPIs  for  various  species,  ranging 
from yeast S. cerevisiae to human. On the other hand, MIPS 
not  only  provides  mammalian  PPIs  but  also  offers  the 
functional  catalogs  that  contain  descriptions  of  protein 
functions.  Unlike  BioGRID  and  MIPS,  STRING  contains 
identified and predicted functional interactions of proteins 
with  functional  similarity  scores  (i.e.,  STRING  offers 
weighted networks). For transcriptional regulatory interac-
tions, transcriptional regulatory element database (TRED) 
[19]  offers  GRNs  and  transcriptional  factors  for  three 
species;  human,  mouse,  and  rat.  On  the  other  hand, 
RegulonDB [20] contains both experimental datasets and 
computational prediction results of transcriptional regula-
tory interactions for the Escherichia coli K-12 organism.

Statistical  Reconstruction  of  the  Gene  Re-
gulatory  Network  from  Gene  Expression 
Data

Biological  networks  are  generally  constructed  using 
known interactions identified from previous experiments. 
To  integrate  these  separate  pieces  of  information  in  the 
literature, text mining methods [21-24] have been proposed 
and used in the majority of public databases explained in the 
previous  section.  Although  most  biological  networks  are 
based on identified interactions under many different condi-
tions and properties, GRNs can be constructed from gene 
expression datasets from a user’s experimental datasets that 
implicitly  contain  gene  regulation  information  in  specific 
conditions  (e.g.,  disease-specific,  tissue-specific,  or  drug- 
specific  GRNs).  Most  recently,  the  Encyclopedia  of  DNA 
Elements  (ENCODE)  project  [25]  produced  numerous 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets that can provide gene

expression  levels  and  chromatin  immunoprecipitation-se-
quencing  (ChIP-seq)  datasets  that  directly  contain  infor-
mation  about  transcription  factors  (TFs).  Integrative  me-
thods  for  reconstructing  GRNs  [26,  27]  have  been  deve-
loped  with  the  ENCODE  [25]  and  modENCODE  [28] 
project datasets. But, we focus on statistical approaches to 
reconstruct GRNs with gene expression datasets. Readers 
can refer to [26, 27] to read the details of reconstructing 
GRNs with ENCODE project datasets.

Many statistical approaches that infer networks from gene 
expression datasets have been developed. In this section, we 
briefly  introduce  four  approaches  to  reconstruct  GRNs: 
Gaussian  graphical  model,  Bayesian  network,  correlation 
network, and information theory. Table 2 summarizes the 
methods  described  in  this  section  with  implementation 
languages and available URLs. A comparison study of several 
methods in these approaches has been published [29]. We 
remark  that  this  review  covers  recent  methods  of  the 
Gaussian  graphical  model  and  information  theory  appro-
aches.

Gaussian graphical model

To cover the basic principle behind the Gaussian graphic 
model, let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph with a set V of 
nodes and a set E of edges and X = (X1, X2, … , Xp ) = (X1, X2, 
…, Xn)T be an n × p dimensional design matrix, where Xj 
denotes a j-th variable and Xi denotes an i-th sample. In the 
Gaussian graphical model, it is assumed that an observation 
is  from  a  p-dimensional  multivariate  normal  distribution 
with mean zero and covariance matrix ∑ (i.e., Xi∼N(0, ∑) 
for i=1, 2,…, n). From this normality assumption, Xi and Xj 
are conditionally independent if (∑-1)ij = 0 [30]. With this 
property, the Gaussian graphical model represents a con-
ditional dependency between two variables into an edge (i.e., 
(i, j)  ∈ E if (∑-1)ij  ≠ 0). Thus, we can obtain a network 
structure by estimating the inverse of covariance matrix (∑-1), 
which  is  called  a  precision  matrix.  It  is  known  that  the 
maximum  likelihood  estimator  (MLE)  of  the  precision 
matrix is an inverse matrix of the sample covariance matrix. 
However, for high-dimensional data (p ＞ n), the MLE of the 
precision  matrix  can  not  be  obtained  from  the  sample 
covariance  matrix,  since  the  sample  covariance  matrix  is 
singular.

To resolve this problem and obtain the sparse solution, 
l1-regularized methods have been developed. These methods 
can be categorized into four types: regression-based [31, 32], 
penalized  likelihood  [33-38],  empirical  Bayes  [39],  and 
constrained  l1  minimization  [40].  We  briefly  introduce  a 
recently developed example for each type of method. First, 
the sparse partial correlation estimation (SPACE) method 
[32]  jointly  solves  p  regression  problems  with  l1  norm 

penalty on partial correlations. SPACE performs well in the 
detection of hub nodes that have many connections with 
other nodes. Unlike regression based-methods, the penali-
zed likelihood-based methods directly maximize a likelihood 
function  with  positive  definite  constraints  and  l1  norm 
penalty on elements of the precision matrix. This maximi-
zation problem, proposed by [33], is more difficult to solve 
than  the  regression  problem.  To  efficiently  solve  this 
problem, Friedman et al. [38] developed the graphical lasso 
algorithm that is motivated from [34, 35] and faster than 
other existing methods. In the empirical Bayes-based me-
thods, Schafer and Strimmer [39] proposed the GeneNet 
method, based on multiple testing procedure on the partial 
correlations estimated by the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse 
and the bootstrap method. Finally, Cai et al. [40] recently 
proposed  constrained  l1-minimization  for  inverse  matrix 
estimation (CLIME), which directly minimizes the l1-norm 
of the precision matrix with a constraint for relaxation of the 
precision matrix condition.

Bayesian network

A Bayesian network is a probabilistic framework for repre-
senting  a  directed  acyclic  graph  (DAG)  structure,  while 
Gaussian graphical models consider undirected graph struc-
tures. With the structure of DAG, the joint probabilities can 
be explicitly calculated from a simple conditional distribu-
tion.  To  obtain  the  network  structure,  Bayesian  network 
methods generally select the graph structure by following 
three steps. Step 1－a candidate DAG structure is chosen 
among all possible DAG structures. Step 2－the posterior 
probability of the candidate DAG structure, given the gene 
expression data, is calculated. Step 3－repeat steps 1 and 2 
until  the  highest  posterior  probability  is  obtained.  Thus, 
searching candidate DAG structures becomes a critical part 
of the Bayesian network methods when the number of nodes 
increases. To avoid this problem, many heuristics are applied 
to improve efficiency [41-43]. For instance, B-Course [41], 
which  is  a  web-based  application,  uses  a  combination  of 
stochastic and greedy search, and BNT [42] and Werhli’s 
Bayesian network [43] adopt Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) methods to find the best network structure for 
given gene expression data. 

Correlation network

Correlation  networks  represent  pairwise  correlations 
between two nodes into edges. Although the construction of 
correlation networks can be straightforward to obtain from 
Pearson’s correlations, it leads to a problem－that all the 
edges in the network are connected, since these correlations 
are generally non-zero. Thus, it is required that meaningless 
relationships in the correlation network be removed to focus 

202

www.genominfo.org

on important edges that highly correlate nodes. To remedy 
this problem, hard thresholds [44] or soft thresholds [45] 
are  applied  to  Pearson’s  correlations.  By  using  threshold 
cutoffs,  correlation  network  methods  can  capture  biolo-
gically meaningful relationships. Moreover, this represen-
tation, based on correlations, is useful not only to identify 
modules of genes but also to interpret regulation interac-
tions.  “WGCNA”  [46],  an  R  implemented  package,  is  an 
example that makes use of correlation networks. WGCNA 
provides  the  construction  of  unweighted  (or  weighted) 
networks with hard and soft threshold schemes [44, 45]. In 
addition, WGCNA offers various functions to analyze the 
network, including module detection, calculation of topo-
logical properties, and visualization. 

Information theory

Information theory-based methods construct the GRN, 
based on information theoretic scores, such as the mutual 
information (MI), to measure dependencies between varia-
bles [47-50]. Unlike correlations, the MI does not assume 
the  linearity  and  the  continuity  of  variables.  Thus,  infor-
mation theory-based methods generally outperform other 
methods that are based on correlation coefficients when the 
true network structure contains non-linearity dependencies. 
We first review two popular methods that reconstruct GRNs 
based on MI values and then introduce recently developed 
methods.

The relevance network method [47] uses the MI values to 
determine the edges in the GRN. To select significant edges, 
the relevance network proposes a threshold rule based on 
the distribution of the permuted MI values. The maximum 
value of the average of the permuted MI values is considered 
the threshold value. On the other hand, ARACNE [48, 49] 
additionally takes into account data processing inequality 
(DPI), in which the MI value of an indirect interaction is less 
than or equal to each MI value of the direct interactions for 
all triplets of nodes that only have two direct interactions. 
This DPI enforces that ARACNE [48, 49] discards indirect 
interactions  and  some  direct  interactions  with  small  MI 
values.

To improve the accuracy of the information theory-based 
methods,  the  context  likelihood  of  relatedness  (CLR) 
algorithm [50] and the gene expression and transcription 
factor  activity-based  relevance  network  (GTRNetwork) 
algorithm [51] have been developed. These methods focus 
on  the  transcriptional  regulatory  interactions  between 
known TFs and their target genes. Instead of using the MI 
values  directly,  the  CLR  algorithm  proposes  a  likelihood 
value based on z-scores derived from the empirical distri-
bution of the MI values in order to adjust random noises in 
the  MI  values.  In  addition  to  the  CLR  algorithm,  the 

Genomics  &  Informatics  Vol.  11,  No.  4,  2013

GTRNetwork algorithm additionally considers transcription 
factor activities (TFAs) between TFs and target genes as a 
hidden  layer.  The  GTRNetwork  algorithm  first  estimates 
changes of TFAs with known TF-gene networks and then 
identifies  transcriptional  regulatory  interactions  between 
the estimated TFAs and genes with the CLR algorithm. More 
recently,  Zhang  et  al.  [52]  described  the  transcription 
procedure  with  TFAs  by  using  the  ordinary  differential 
equation.  Unlike  the  GTRNetwork  algorithm,  the  NAR-
ROMI  algorithm  considers  the  gene  expression  data  for 
candidate TFs as the TFAs and solves the minimization of 
the absolute errors between inferred and observed expres-
sions  with  l1-norm  penalty  on  the  strength  coefficients, 
which is referred to as recursive optimization in [52]. The 
NARROMI algorithm proposes  the linear combination of 
the MI values and the absolute values of estimated strength 
coefficients as the final scores to construct the GRN.

Network-Based Applications

From  the  advances  of  high-throughput  technologies, 
large-scale networks have been identified and are available 
from various public databases, as summarized in Table 1. In 
this section, we focus on network-based applications, es-
pecially how to use previously identified network resources 
in order to obtain meaningful biological interpretations. We 
first introduce three basic concepts in graph theory [53] to 
give an overview of the basic concepts of the network-based 
methods. First, a neighborhood of a node is a set of nodes 
connected  to  the  node.  Second,  the  distance  between  two 
nodes is defined as a length of the shortest path between 
them if the path exists; otherwise, it is set to infinity. Finally, 
an adjacency matrix is a binary and symmetric matrix such that 
its ij-th element is equal to 1 if there is an edge from a node 
i to a node j; otherwise, it is 0. In some cases, a weighted 
adjacency matrix can be used to represent the strengths of 
edges that usually fall between 0 and 1. With these basic 
concepts, we introduce three network-based applications: 
protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and 
genome-wide association study.

Protein function prediction

With the results of sequencing genomes, the efforts to 
predict protein functions have been focused on the functio-
nalities  of  genomic  annotations.  In  the  initial  stage,  the 
prediction  of  protein  function  begins  with  the  sequence 
homologies to annotated proteins [54-57]. These methods 
have  been  successful,  but  70%  of  proteins  still  remain 
unannotated  [58].  Accordingly,  various  types  of  methods 
have been developed to characterize unannotated proteins. 
In  this  review,  we  introduce  four  approaches  in  protein

function  prediction,  based  on  direct  interactions  in  the 
network: neighborhood-based, graph-based, Bayesian, and 
Kernel-based approaches. The methods are summarized in 
Table 3 [10, 11, 13-16, 59-83].

In neighborhood-based approach, the proposed methods 
[1, 62, 63, 65] commonly consider the number of edges con-
nected to annotated proteins in a neighborhood. The neigh-
borhood counting method [1] only takes into account the 
frequencies of annotated proteins in the neighborhood and 
chooses the top three functions, with the calculated frequen-
cies  ranked  in  descending  order  for  each  protein.  Other 
methods  also  have  derived  their  own  scores,  such  as  χ2 
statistics [62] and functional similarities [63, 65], based on 
the  annotated  protein  information  in  the  neighborhood. 
These methods choose a function with the highest score as a 
predicted function for each protein.

The graph-based approach is similar to the neighborhood- 
based approach, but the graph-based approach focuses more 
on  how  to  label  the  unannotated  proteins  with  graph 
theoretical properties, such as the distance and the adjacency 
matrix. The label assignment models have been proposed 
with the adjacency matrix [66] and the weighted adjacency 
matrix [67], respectively. Since these assignment problems 
are computationally intractable, the heuristic methods, such 
as the simple threshold rule or simulated annealing [84], 
have been applied. To avoid these computational problems, 
several propagation-flavored methods have been developed. 
First,  the  label  propagation  methods  [69,  70]  obtain  the 
optimal  assignments and  the optimal combination  of  the 

Table  3.  Network-based  protein  function  prediction  methods

weight  matrices  that  reflects  different  types  of  networks. 
Second, the functional flow method [68] iteratively spreads 
the  flow  from  the  annotated  protein  to  the  unannotated 
proteins  by  connected  edges.  The  functional  flow  score, 
defined  as  an  amount  of  the  flow,  is  the  criterion  of  the 
prediction. Third, the sequential linear neighborhood pro-
pagation  method  [71]  sequentially  updates  unlabeled 
proteins according to their shortest path distance to the set 
of labeled proteins. Finally, the neighbor relativity coefficient 
(NRC) method [72] derives the NRC score by integrating 
various graph topological properties, such as the shortest 
path distance, path connectivity, and common neighbors. 

The Bayesian approach takes into account the posterior 
probabilities of binary label random variables to obtain the 
prediction from the observed network and annotated pro-
teins. Markov random field (MRF)-based [85] methods [74, 
75] have been proposed and modified to Bayesian MRF [77] 
recently. To predict protein functions, these methods com-
monly derive the marginal posterior probability of the binary 
label variable given other variables and then estimate the 
posterior probability by Gibbs sampling. In addition to MRF- 
based models, other probabilistic models [78-80] have been 
developed under hierarchical structures from gene ontology 
[64]－which provides gene product annotation data that are 
characterized  into  three  categories:  biological  processes, 
cellular components, and molecular functions－with some 
models,  such  as  the  hierarchical  binomial  neighborhood 
model [79]. In particular, Jiang et al. [80] considered the 
auto-probit  model  with  a  weighted  network  information

from STRING [16], and their auto-probit model also reflects 
the uncertainty of the annotation [64].

The Kernel-based approach considers the protein function 
prediction  problem  as  a  classification  problem.  To  reflect 
network  information  into  the  classification  state,  the 
network  information  is  converted  into  a  kernel  matrix. 
Lanckriet  et  al.  [81]  proposed  the  kernel-based  support 
vector machine (SVM) method, which incorporates hetero-
geneous types of data, such as amino acid sequence, gene 
expression data, and PPI network data, by converting these 
data into kernel matrices. The SVM method can be refor-
mulated  as  semi-definite  programming  (SDP)  [86]  with 
kernels.  Although  the  SVM  method  performs  well,  this 
method  becomes  slow  when  the  dimension  increases, 
caused  by  the  computational  complexity  of  the  SDP.  To 
remedy this problem, Lee et al. [82] proposed the kernel- 
based logistic regression (KLR) method by combing MRF- 
based methods [74, 75] with the diffusion kernel [87]. The 
KLR  can  contain  multiple  functions  and  various  types  of 
datasets at once. It has been shown that the KLR method is 
faster  than  the  SVM  and  is  comparable  to  the  SVM  in 
prediction accuracy [82]. Recently, Wang et al. [83] proposed 
the function-function correlated multi-label method, which 
treats all function categories in the prediction at once, while 
other methods only consider one function at a time, except 
for KLR.

Disease gene prioritization

  Disease-gene  association  studies  have  focused  on 
identifying relationships between disease phenotypes and 
genes to reveal and understand human disease mechanisms. 
Although traditional approaches, including linkage analysis 
and association studies, have been successful, the specified 
genomic intervals often contain tens or even hundreds of 
genes. It may not be possible by experiments to identify the 
correct  causative  genes  of  all  the  genes  that  lie  on  the 
specified intervals. To reduce experimental costs and efforts, 
the  prioritization  of  candidate  genes  becomes  one  of  the 
major tasks in disease-gene association studies.

Taking  into  consideration  that  genes  corresponding  to 
similar disease phenotypes tend to be neighbors in either a 
PPI network [88, 89] or a pathway [90], several network- 
based disease gene prioritization methods have been pro-

posed  recently.  The  network-based  disease  gene  prioriti-
zation  methods  [91-94]  define  different  similarity  scores 
between the disease and genes, based on either functional 
annotations or PPI networks, to rank candidate genes. The 
random walk method [91] considers the random walk on 
graphs and uses a diffusion kernel matrix [87] derived from 
a  PPI  network  as  the  steady-state  transition  probability 
matrix. The random walk method then defines the similarity 
score as the sum of elements of the diffusion kernel corre-
sponding to known disease genes for each candidate gene. 
CIPHER  [92]  adopts  a  regression  model  for  similarities 
between phenotypes and considers the Gaussian kernel for 
closeness  between  genes.  The  Pearson  correlation  coeffi-
cient between the similarity of phenotypes and the closeness 
between genes is used as a similarity score. On the other 
hand,  PRINCE  [93]  and  MINProp  [94]  are  based  on  the 
iterative label propagation algorithm [95]. PRINCE defines 
the  prioritization  function,  which  combines  functional 
similarities from the network information with prior infor-
mation for disease phenotypes as the similarity score. The 
prioritization function is obtained by iteratively applying a 
label  propagation  algorithm.  MINProp  first  defines  two 
heterogeneous  networks,  such  as  a  gene  network  and  a 
disease  network,  and  then  additionally  defines  bipartite 
networks between two heterogeneous networks from known 
disease-gene associations. After initializing the labels of the 
disease genes, MINProp iteratively propagates label infor-
mation through three networks until convergence occurs. 
Finally, the converged label scores are used as the similarity 
scores. From the comparison study in [93, 94], PRINCE and 
MINProp outperform the random walk and CIPHER me-
thods, respectively. There is no comparison study between 
PRINCE and MINProp, but MINProp is more general than 
PRINCE, since MINProp can be applied to three or more 
heterogeneous  networks.  We  report  these  disease  gene 
prioritization methods with their data resources in Table 4 
[12, 13, 15-18, 91-94, 96-99].

Genome-wide association study (GWAS)

The  GWAS  measures  DNA  sequence  variations  in  the 
human  genome  to  identify  associations  between  genetic 
variants and diseases (or phenotypes). To measure genetic 
variations,  the  single-  nucleotide  polymorphism  (SNP),

which  represents  a  single  base-pair  change  in  the  DNA 
sequence, is generally used as a marker of a genomic region 
in the GWAS. Generally, the GWAS conducts a comparison 
of the SNPs between case and control groups (i.e., disease 
and  non-disease  groups)  by  statistical  methods,  such  as 
ANOVA and logistic regression, to identify significant SNPs 
related  to  the  disease.  Genetic  risk  factors  revealed  by  a 
GWAS can be used as preventive markers or for therapeutic 
targets in curing the disease. There have been more than 
11,000  SNPs  discovered  as  candidate  bio-markers  in 
common diseases [100]. The large number of SNPs detec-
table in the human genome can, however, lead to multiple 
testing problems. To control the false positive errors (i.e., 
type I errors in the context of statistical testing procedures), 
the  Bonferroni  correction  and  false  discovery  rate  [101] 
methods are commonly adopted. Although these multiple 
testing rules have been successful in the identification of 
significant single SNPs, these test procedures often fail to 
detect genomic regions that are weakly associated with the 
disease and still ignore the combined effects caused by the 
interactions between genes. 

The network-based GWAS methods [102-104], summa-
rized in Table 5 [12, 13, 17, 102-114], take into account both 
interactions  between  genes  or  proteins  with  association 
information available from a GWAS. The HumanNet method 
[115]  combines  functional  gene  networks  derived  from 
multiple  network  sources,  such  as  the  PPI  network,  and 
mRNA co-expression with the log odds ratio from GWAS 
data  to  prioritize  disease  genes.  By  combining  functional 
gene  networks  and  the  information  from  GWAS  data, 
HumanNet  has  higher  power  to  detect  disease-related 
genes.  Unlike  HumanNet,  NIMMI  [116]  and  dmGWAS 
[117] focus on identifying groups of genes associated with 
diseases, based on GWAS data and PPI network data. NIMMI 
constructs a PPI network with weights of genes by using a 
modified Google PageRank algorithm [118]. The weights of 
genes are then combined with the gene-based association 
p-values calculated from GWAS data. The subnetworks of 
genes are identified by the DAVID method [119, 120] with 
the network structure and weights of genes. On the other 
hand,  dmGWAS  only  considers  gene-based  association 
p-values as the node weights and proposes a modified ver-

sion of the dense module searching method [121] to prio-
ritize candidate groups of genes.

Discussion

We have reviewed a number of methods related to two 
topics in network data analysis: network reconstruction and 
network-based application. Network reconstruction can be 
thought of as a reverse-engineering problem whose goal is to 
rebuild true structures or relationships from observations. 
In particular, we focused on statistical methods for building 
GRNs, including the Gaussian graphical model, correlation 
network, Bayesian network, and information theory-based 
methods. Most methods that we have reviewed consider the 
sparsity on the graph structure to select a small number of 
significant dependencies between nodes. This sparsity con-
dition  is  adequate  for  the  network  in  biological  systems, 
since it reflects a scale-free feature, where several nodes have 
many edges but the majority of nodes only has three or four 
edges [5]. Although most methods in Gaussian graphical 
models are well studied in their theoretical properties, these 
methods have limitations when applied to biological data. 
Since these methods basically assume a Gaussian distribu-
tion, they are only applicable for continuous-type datasets, 
such as gene expression levels. To construct networks from 
other types of data, such as binary or counts, the Bayesian 
network and information theory-based methods are more 
attractive than correlation-based methods.

Second, we introduced various methods in three network- 
based applications. Most methods consider similarity mea-
sures between nodes and then use these measures to predict 
biological functions or prioritize candidate genes associated 
with diseases. As technologies in the experiments progress, 
the  network-based  methods  can  be  improved  and  widely 
extended.  For  instance,  even  though  the  neighborhood 
counting  method  [1]  in  protein  function  prediction  only 
considers  the  count  of  annotated  functions  in  the  neigh-
borhood  from  a  PPI  network,  the  recently  developed 
methods [72, 83] can contain not only neighborhood infor-
mation  but  also  functional  similarities  from  multiple 
networks. In addition, module-assisted methods that focus 
on  identifying  a  functional  group  of  proteins  are  also

network-based tumor stratification (NBS) method has been 
developed  recently  [123].  This  NBS  method  combines 
mutation profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
projects [116, 117, 124, 125] and network information to 
obtain  informative  strata  (e.g.,  subtypes  of  cancer). 
Although  these  network-based  methods  have  been  im-
proved,  these  methods  still  lack  accuracy  compared  with 
other methods [115]. Since the high-throughput data may 
contain  many  false  positives  [126],  the  network-based 
methods  are  affected  in  their  accuracy.  Although  their 
performance depends on the quality of data, their effects are 
expected to decrease in the future as improvements are made 
in measurement accuracy.
