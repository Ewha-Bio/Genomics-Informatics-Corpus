Platelets  are  derived  from  the  fragments  that  are  formed  from  the  cytoplasm  of  bone  marrow  megakaryocytes−small 

irregularly shaped anuclear cells. Platelets respond to vascular damage, contracts blood vessels, and attaches to the damaged 
region, thereby stopping bleeding, together with the action of blood coagulation factors. Platelet activation is known to 
affect  genes  associated  with  vascular  risk  factors,  as  well  as  with  arteriosclerosis  and  myocardial  infarction.  Here,  we 
performed a genome-wide association study with 352,228 single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in 8,842 subjects of the 
Korea Association Resource (KARE) project and replicated the results in 7,861 subjects from an independent population. We 
identified genetic associations between platelet count and common variants nearby chromosome 4p16.1 (p = 1.46 × 10–10, 
in the KIAA0232 gene), 6p21 (p = 1.36 × 10–7, in the BAK1 gene), and 12q24.12 (p = 1.11 × 10–15, in the SH2B3 gene). Our 
results illustrate the value of large-scale discovery and a focus for several novel research avenues.

Introduction

Blood circulates through the body, affecting the tissues by 
delivering  oxygen  and  nutrients  responsible  for  tissue 
viability. The size, number, and concentration of a cell in the 
blood vary among populations, and these have been regarded 
as  factors  influencing  various  disorders,  such  as  erythro-
cytosis, anemia, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. 
During the last 2 decades, genetic studies have revealed that 
there exists a genetic effect on several hematologic variables. 
Moreover,  previous  studies  reported  that  genetic  factors 
strongly influence the variation in the counts and size of 
blood cells [1, 2]. Although a few genes are known to affect 
hematologic traits, the physiological mechanisms underly-
ing the traits are largely unrevealed. 

Platelets are anuclear cytoplasmic fragments that play a 
key role in maintaining primary adhesion, aggregation, and 
secretion  and  providing  procoagulant  surface  and  clot 
retraction. The primary functions of a platelet count are to 
assist in the diagnosis of bleeding disorders and to monitor 
patients who are being treated for any disease involving bone 

marrow failure. Low platelet counts or abnormally shaped 
platelets  are  associated  with  bleeding  disorders,  whereas 
high  platelet  counts  sometimes  indicate  disorders  of  the 
bone marrow. Platelet activation is known to affect genes 
associated  with  vascular  risk  factors,  as  well  as  with 
arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Platelet count is a 
readily available laboratory test and has been associated with 
different clinical and epidemiologic factors and are tightly 
regulated and inversely correlated in the healthy population 
[3].  Furthermore,  because  platelet  count  differs  between 
inter-ethnic  groups,  gender  and  ethnicity  should  be  im-
portant considerations for a platelet count study [4].

Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for 
hematological traits have been reported [5-7]. Particularly, 
68 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with 
platelet  count  were  identified  by  a  GWAS  [8].  However, 
although the heritability of variation in platelet count ranged 
from 54% to more than 80% [9-11], the genetic variants 
reported  to  date  explain  only  a  small  fraction  of  the 
heritability in platelet count [12]. Therefore, new studies 
have opportunities to unveil additional genetic variants for 
explaining missing heritability [12].

JH  Oh,  et  al.  Platelet  Count  in  Koreans

In this study, we conducted a GWAS to find a contribution 
of the genetic basis on hematologic variables, such as platelet 
count, in Koreans.

Methods
Subjects 

We conducted a GWAS using individuals sampled from a 
part of the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES). 
The study subjects were  recruited from  population-based 
cohorts  in  the  regions  of  Anseong  and  Ansan.  The 
standardized examinations applied in this survey included 
10,038 participants aged  40  to 69  years.  Subjects  for the 
replication study were recruited from the Health2 cohorts, 
another  population-based  cohort  comprising  the  Wonju, 
Pyeongchang, Gangneung, Geumsan, and Naju regions in 
Korea.  Among  a  total  of  8,500  participants  within  the 
Health2  cohort,  7,861  subjects  were  selected  for  the 
replication analysis based on their age and information about 
concomitant disease and medication [13].

Platelet counts and genotyping

Peripheral blood was isolated by using the G-DEX TM Ⅱb 
DNA  Extraction  Kit  (iNtRON  Biotechnology,  Seongnam, 
Korea). Platelet count was measured using an ADVIA 120 
(Bayer, Tarrytown, NY, USA). Genomic DNA, genotyped on 
the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  Human  SNP  array  5.0 
(Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), was isolated from 
peripheral  blood  drawn  from  Anseong  and  Ansan  cohort 
participants.  Of  9,603  genotyped  samples,  we  excluded 
samples  with  high  heterozygosity  (＞30%,  n  =  11)  and 
gender inconsistencies (n = 41). Also, individuals who had 
developed any kind of cancer (n = 101) were excluded from 
subsequent analyses. To examine population stratification 
overall, related or identical individuals with higher values 
than first-degree relatives of Korean sib-pair samples were 
also  excluded  according  to  average  pair-wise  identity-by- 
state  (IBS)  values  (＞0.80,  n  =  608).  The  methods  to 
estimate  heterozygosity  and  IBS  have  been  described 
elsewhere [13]. SNP markers with a high missing genotype 
rate (＞5%), low minor allele frequency (MAF, ＜0.01), and 
significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p 
–6) were excluded. Consequently, a total of 352,228 
＜ 1 × 10
markers  were  used  for  the  GWAS.  For  the  replication 
analysis,  19  SNPs  of  the  Health2  population,  comprising 
7,861  participants,  were  genotyped  by  GoldenGate  assay 
(Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Imputation

html) [14, 15]. On the basis of NCBI, build 36 and dbSNP, 
build 126, we initially used 90 individuals from Japanese in 
Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) 
founders in HapMap as a reference panel, comprising 3.99 
million  SNPs  (release  22).  After  removing  SNPs  with  an 
MAF ＜ 0.01 and an SNP missing rate ＞ 0.05, we combined 
the remaining 1.8 million imputed SNPs with the directly 
typed  Korea  Association  Resource  (KARE)  SNPs  for  the 
association analyses. Association analyses for imputed SNPs 
were  carried  out by  the  SNPTEST program  (http://www. 
stats.ox.ac.uk/~marchini/software/gwas/snptest.html).

Statistical analysis

Association analysis of platelet trait with genotypes was 
performed using a linear regression model, adjusting for age, 
sex, and recruitment area. Analyses were performed with the 
software  PLINK  (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/ 
plink), SAS version 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA), and R 
statistics  package  version  2.7.1.  The  KARE  GWAS  and 
replication  study  were  combined  by  an  inverse-variance 
meta-analysis  method,  assuming  fixed  effects,  with  Co-
chran’s Q test to assess between-study heterogeneity [16]. 
Regional plots were generated using LocusZoom [17].

Results

Characteristics of the study participants, including age, 
sex, and trait summaries, are presented in Table 1. Quantile- 
quantile analysis of 2-d.f. logistic regression statistics for the 
comparison  of  genotype  frequencies  in  the  cohorts  con-
firmed the genetic homogeneity of these two components of 
the KARE study population (Fig. 1). We observed significant 
SNPs by  applying  a  Bonferroni  adjustment  cut-off  with a 
–7.  The  GWAS  identified 
combined  p-value  ＜ 1.0  ×  10
several  genomic  locations  as  potentially  associated  with 
platelet count (Fig. 2). In a follow-up examination of the 
Health2  cohort,  we  examined  7,861  selected  from  8,500 
participants  (aged,  40  to  69  years).  We  confirmed  3

evidence for association was at 12q24 (rs739496, MAF = 
–15) (Table 2, Fig. 3B). The 
0.11, combined p = 1.15 × 10
associated signal is concordant with a previously published 
result in the Japanese population [6]. This SNP is located in 
the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SH2B adaptor protein 3 
(also known as LNK). SH2B3 is a member of the APS family 
of  adaptor  proteins,  which  play  a  pivotal  role  as  broad 
inhibitors  of  growth  factors  and  cytokine  signaling  path-
ways. The second SNP, rs3733606 (MAF = 0.50, combined p 
–10) (Table 2, Fig. 3A) in 4p16, is in the 3' UTR of

the  KIAA0232  gene,  which  translates  the  functionally 
unknown  hypothetical  protein  LOC9778.  The  third  locus 
associated with platelet is at 6p21 (rs9296095, MAF = 0.23, 
combined p = 1.67 × 10

Discussion

We performed a GWAS of platelet count using 352,225 
SNPs  profiled  with  the  Affymetrix  Genome-Wide  human 
SNP array 5.0 in 8,842 individuals from the Anseong and 
Ansan cohorts as described previously [13]. In a two-stage 
design (8,842 discovery and 7,861 replication samples), we 
confirmed  three  loci  associated  with  platelet  count  at  a 
–7). Besides an 
genomewide significance level (＜ 1.0 × 10
unknown functional gene, we found two candidate genes, 
SH2B3 and BAK1, responsible for the variation in platelet 
counts. These genes are potential candidates for affecting 
platelet count.

is expressed in hematopoietic precursor cells and in endo-
thelial cells and is known to be involved in inflammation 
[18].  LNK-deficient  mice  show  a  marked  difference  of 
hematopoiesis, accompanying increased numbers of various 
types of cells, such as megakaryocytes, B lymphoid, eryth-
roid progenitor, and hematopoietic stem cells [19]. Several 
SNPs within the SH2B3 region are well known as variants 
associated with blood pressure, myocardial infarction, type 1 
diabetes, and celiac disease [20].

BAK1, a multidomain pro-apoptotic family member, has 
shown to be involved in apoptotic cell death, playing a role as 
an essential mediator [21-24]. Kamatani et al. [6] reported 
that BAK1 is a putative strong candidate gene accounting for 
numbers of platelets. This SNP is located in the 4th intron in 
BAK1  (Bcl2-antagonist/killer1),  which  encodes  a  protein 

acting  as  a  strong  proapoptotic  effector  that  is  known  to 
control platelet lifespan [25]. The intrinsic machinery for 
apoptosis regulates the life span of anucleate platelets [25]. 
KIAA0232 has no known biological function and no clue 
for  a  related  biological  pathway.  Given  the  weak  linkage 
disequilibrium  block  around  KIAA0232,  further  investi-
gation is required for the biological function.

Some studies have discovered genetic factors associated 
with platelet count through genome-wide associated studies 
across diverse ethnic groups [12, 26]. Qayyum et al. [12] 
reported  that  a  candidate  gene,  BAK1,  was  significant  in 
African-Americans. Also, Shameer et al. [26] reported that 
SH2B3  and  KIAA0232  in  European  ancestry  were  also 
significant  in  platelet  count  and  mean  platelet  volume, 
respectively.

Numerous  previous  studies  have  demonstrated  the 
association between platelet counts and various phenotypes 
in  human  and  mice  [27].  The  Atherosclerosis  Risk  in 
Community (ARIC) study has shown that platelet counts 
are positively correlated with leukocytes [28]. Turakhia et al. 
[29] also reported the association between higher platelet 
counts  and  residual  thrombus  after  fibrinolytic  therapy, 
which is in agreement with the ARIC study. The evidence of 
a relationship between platelet count and insulin resistance 
in non-obese type 2 diabetic patients was reported from a 
study on Japanese [30]. The number of platelets is also a 
possible predictor of the risk of death and cardiovascular 
disease [31]. 

In  conclusion,  we  identified  and  validated  common 
variants at 1 novel locus, BAK1, and 2 known variants, SH2B 
and  KIAA0232,  responsible  for  the  variation  of  platelet 
counts in population-based cohorts. Our research demon-
strates  the  results  from  a  meta-analysis  and  follow-up 
genotyping to retrieve positive evidence for the association 
of 3 loci with platelet counts. In addition, fine mapping and 
functional  studies  on  the  discovered  loci  will  help  us 
understand the hidden physiological mechanisms underly-
ing platelet count.
