Association of the Human IL-28RAGene Polymorphisms in a Korean Population with Asthma IL-28RA is one of the important candidate genes for complex trait of genetic diseases, but there are only a few published results for this gene. 

Previously, we identified eighteen SNPs and two variation sites in the entire coding regions of IL-28RA including promoter regions, and suggested that the g.32349G>A polymorphism of IL-28RA might be associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis. 

In this study, we chose seven SNPs (g.-1193A>C, g.-30OT, g.17654OT, g.27798A>G, g.31265OT, g.31911OT and g.32349G>A) of IL-28RA, and attempted to find out whether these polymorphisms were furtherassodated with genetic predisposition of asthma. 

We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-28RA polymorphisms between the asthma patients and healthy controls. 

We also investigated the frequencies of haplotype constructed by these SNPs between asthma patients and controls. 

Our results suggest that the polymorphisms of IL-28RA gene were not associated with susceptibility to asthma, and not with IgE production and eosinophil recruitment. 

The haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also not significantly associated between the healthy controls and asthma patients. 

This result indicates that the IL-28RA polymorphisms might be not associated withasthma susceptibility.

Asthma is one of the most common multi-complex disorders that triggered by genetic predisposition and environmental factors (Cookson, 2002). 

Unlike other inflammatory diseases, v the asthmatic inflammatory process is characterized by the predominant secretion of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 by T-helper lymphocyte type 2 (Th2) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) synthesis.IgE mediates early and late asthmatic responses in an induction of lung eosinophil infiltration and Th2 cell cytokine production (Coyle et al., 1996). 

Mast cells are IgE-dependently activated, while eosinophils and basophils are recruited into the site of allergic reaction (Daser et al., 1995; O’Garra, 1998). 

The accumulation of eosinophils is an important characteristicfeature in the pathogenesis of asthma, because it accompanied by inflammation within the bronchial wall (Humbles et al., 1997).

Cytokines are multifunctional proteins that mediate many of responses of innate and adaptive immunities. 

They are produced in response to microbes, antigens, and other cytokines and stimulatediverse responses of cells involved in immunity and inflammation. 

They act on target cells by binding to specific cytokine receptor, initiating signal transduction and second signal pathways within the target cell (Hibi and Hirano, 1998; Onishi et al., 1998; O’Shea et al., 2002). 

The SNPs of many cytokines and their receptor genes, such as IL-10, IL-12, IFNy, RANTES, CCR2 and CCR5, are identified (Gibson eta!., 2001; Hall et al., 2000; Iwasaki et al., 2001) and indicate that the polymorphisms are associated with immune disorders (Fryer et al., 2000; Nakao et al., 2001). 

We previously reported that the polymorphisms of eotaxin gene family (eotaxin, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3) and the exon 4 variation of Tim-1 are associated with asthma in Korean population (Chae et al., 2003; Chae etal., 2004).

The new cytokine family consisting of interleukin 28A (IL-28A; also designated as IFN-y2), IL-28B (IFN-y3) and IL-29 (lFN-y1) and a component of their receptors, 1L-28RA (IFN-yR1), are identified from the human genomic sequence (Dumoutier et al., 2003; Kotenko et al., 2003; Sheppard et al., 2003). 

They are distantly related to type I interferons (IFNs) and the IL-10 family, and induced by viral infection and show antiviral activity (Sheppard etal., 2003; Kotenko et al., 2003). However, IL-28 and IL-29 interact with a heterodimeric class II cytokine receptor that consist of IL-10 receptor p (IL-1OR0) and an orphan class II receptor chain, designated IL-28RA. 

Recently, Dumoutier and co-workers suggested that IL-29 induced STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation is mediated through tyrosines 343 and 517 of the IL-28RAand these two tyrosines are also responsible for antiviral and anti- proliferative activities of IL-29. 

In contrast, STAT4 phosphorylation is independent from IL-28RA tyrosine residues (Dumoutier et al., 2004). IL-28RAgenes are located on the chromosomal region 1 p36.11 and have seven exons.

More recently, we identified eighteen SNPs and two variation sites in human IL-28RA gene and reported that the g.32349G>A polymorphism of IL-28RA might be associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis (Chae et a/., 2006). 

In an attempt to better understand the genetic influences of IL-28RA on allergic disease such as asthma, we analyzed the genotype frequencies of the SNPs in IL-28RA in the genomic DNAs isolated from asthma patients and healthy controls to determine whether these IL-28RA SNPs are associated with asthma susceptibility. 

We further investigated the relationships among these polymorphisms to IgE levels and peripheral blood eosinophil counts in asthma patients.

On the basis of approval and informed consent from the review board of School of Medicine, Wonkwang University, blood samples were obtained from 280 asthma patients (146 males and 134 females) and 559 healthy non-asthma controls (346 males and 213 females). 

The mean ages of asthma patients and healthy controls were about 50.5 and 40.8 years respectively. 

Genomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of peripheral blood by a standard phenol- chloroform method or by Genomic DNA Extraction kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Korea) according to manufacturer’s directions. 

The asthma (atopic and non-atopic) patients were recruited from our outpatient clinic at Chonbuk National University Hospital. 

Asthma was diagnosed in reference to the criteria of the American Thoracic Society (American Thoracic Society, 1987). 

The healthy controls were recruited from the general population and had undergone a comprehensive medical screening at the Wonkwang University Hospital. 

All subjects employed in this study were Korean who is living in the same area. 

Blood eosinophil counts and total serum IgE levels in asthma patients were measured, at the Department of Hematology of Chonbuk National University Hospital, using a Coulter GenSTM Hematology Analyzer (Florida, USA) and Roche COBAS-COREII (Roche Diagnostics, Basal, Switzerland), respectively.

The entire coding regions of IL-28RA including -2.0 kb promoter regions were partially amplified by PCR using the six primer pairs, and PCR reactions were prepared by previously described condition (Chae et al., 2006). 

Amplification was carried out in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermocycler (PE Applied Biosystem, USA) at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 10 cycles at 94°C for 10 seconds, 68°C or 45 seconds (2 minutes for promoter and exon 1 region, and 4 minutes for exon 7 and 3’ UTR region), and 68°C for 10 minutes. 

Then 20 cycles at 94°C for 10 seconds, 68°C for 45 seconds and 68°C or 10 minutes (with 10 seconds incremental increases per cycle) were followed by a final extension at 68°C for 7 minutes.

Genotyping for g.-1193A>C, g.-30C>T, g.17654C>T, g.27798A>G, g.31265C>T, g.31911C>Tar}d g.32349G>A in the IL-28RA gene was performed by single-base extension (SBE) method (Chae et al., 2006) using the ABI Prism® SNaPshot™ Multiplex kit (Applied Biosystems). 

The PCR products purified by PCR purification kit (Millipore, USA) were used as the template DNA for genotyping. 

The SBE reaction mix was prepared according to previously described method (Chae et al., 2005). 

The primer extension reaction was performed at 96°C for 1 minute, followed by 25 cycles at 96°C for 10 seconds, 55°C for 40 seconds, and 60°C for 30 seconds. 

To clean up the primer extension reaction, 1.5 unit of CIP (Promega) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 90 minutes, followed by 15 minutes at 72°C for purposes of enzyme inactivation. 

The purified extension products were added to Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. 

The mixture was incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 5 minutes on ice, and then electrophoresis was performed, using the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. 

The results were analyzed using the ABI Prism GeneScan and Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems).

The allergic rhinitis patients and non-allergic rhinitis controls were compared using case-control association analyses. 

The x 2 tests were used to estimate the Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for SNP sites. 

Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) analyses by pair-wise comparison of biallelic loci and the haplotype frequencies of IL-28RA for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with SNPAlyze software (DYNACOM, Japan). 

The haplotype analyses of IL-28RA SNPs between asthma patients and control were performed by Permutation test. 

A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

In response to different cytokine profiles, T helper cells are classified into Th1 and Th2 subsets. 

Th1 cells secrete cytokines (including IFN-y, IL-2 and TNF-p) and they join in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. 

On the other hand, Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. Eventually, they promote antibody production and control extracellular pathogens (Ho and Glimcher, 2002). 

Th1/Th2 balance is very important in maintaining the healthy state of body. 

When the balance is altered, some disorders (such as asthma and RA) would occur. 

Th1 and Th2 cells can mutually antagonize the differentiation of the counterpart subset (Lafaille etal., 1997). 

IL-28RA is recently identified from the human genomic sequence as a component of their receptors for the new cytokine consisting of IL-28A, IL-28B and IL-29 (Sheppard et al., 2003; Kotenko et al., 2003). 

Although IL-28RA is one of the important candidate genes for complex trait of genetic diseases, there are only a few published results for this gene. 

Previously, we identified eighteen SNPs and two variation sites in the entire coding regions of IL-28RA including promoter regions, and suggested that the g.32349G>A polymorphism of IL-28RA might be associated with susceptibility to allergic rhinitis, but seems to have no relationship with serum total IgE levels. 

The haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also show significant association between controls and allergic rhinitis patients.

In our present study, we attempted to find out whether these polymorphisms of IL-28RA were further associated with genetic predisposition of another allergic disease such as asthma. 

We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-28RA polymorphisms between the asthma patients and healthy controls. 

The genotype frequencies of all loci were in HWE (P>0.05, data not shown). 

The genotype and allele frequencies of polymorphisms in asthma patients were not significantly different from those in the controls group (Table 1). 

This result suggests the polymorphisms of IL-28RA are not associated with susceptibility to asthma. 

We further analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of atopic asthma, non-atopic asthma patients and healthy controls. 

In both atopic and non-atopic asthma patients, the genotype and allele frequencies of IL-28RA polymorphism, were not significantly different from the frequencies of healthy control group (Table 2). 

This result indicates that the polymorphism of IL-28RA might be not associated with susceptibility of atopic disease. 

Eosinophil is accumulated in high numbers in the lungs of asthmatic patients and is believed to be essential in phagocytosis as well as in allergic and inflammatory reactions of asthma. 

Therefore, the number of accumulated eosinophils within the bronchial wall is a characteristic feature of asthma (Humbles etal., 1997). 

At least, a dozen of polymorphic genes have been estimated that regulate asthma by controlling the inflammatory response, total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), cytokines and chemokines (Cookson, 1999). 

However, our results reveal the polymor phisms of IL-28RA gene in asthma patients are not closely associated with the level of total serum IgE, the peripheral blood eosinophil count, FVC and FEVi (Table 3). 

We also calculated the haplotype fre­ quencies among g.-30C>T, g.17654C>T, g.27798A>G and g.32349G>A in both healthy controls and asthma patients. 

While the most major haplotype (20.3% of distributions) in healthy control was TCGG, the most major haplotype (22.5% of distributions) was TCAG in asthma patients (Table 4). 

The distribution of haplotype TCAG and TTAG were significantly different between the controls and asthma patients (P=0.039 and P = 0.023, respectively). 

But the frequency of haplotype TTAG was low in both group, and the haplotype TCAG corrected by bonferroni correction also not significantly associated. 

These results suggest that the haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also not significantly associated between the healthy controls and asthma patients.

In this study, our results suggest that the polymorphisms of IL-28RA gene were not associated with susceptibility to asthma, and not with IgE production and eosinophil recruitment. 

The haplotype frequencies by these SNPs also not significantly associated between controls and asthmapatients. 

Our study is the first analysis about IL-28RA SNPs in asthma, and may contribute to the future study on the IL-28RA functions and association studies with other allergic, atopic or infectious disease.
