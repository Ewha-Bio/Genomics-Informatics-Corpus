How Many SNPs Should Be Used for the Human Phylogeny of Highly Related Ethnicities? A Case of Pan Asian 63 Ethnicities.

 In planning a model-based phylogenic study for highly related ethnic data, the SNP marker number is an important factor to determine for relationship inferences.

Genotype frequency data, utilizing a sub sampling method, from 63 Pan Asian ethnic groups was used for determining the minimum SNP number required to establish such relationships.

Bootstrap random subsamplings were done from 5.6K PASNPi SNP data.

DA distance was calculated and neighbour-joining trees were drawn with every re-sampling data set.

Consensus trees were made with the same 100 sub-samples and bootstrap proportions were calculated.

The tree consistency to the one obtained from the whole marker set, improved with increasing marker numbers.

The bootstrap proportions became reliable when more than 7,000 SNPs were used at a time.

Within highly related ethnic groups, the minimum SNPs number for a robust neighborjoining tree inference was about 7,000 for a 95% bootstrap support.

Autosomal Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are now widely used for human linkage analyses and demographic history inferences (Abdulla et al., 2009; Cavalli Sforza and Feldman, 2003; Collins et al., 1997; Li et al., 2008; Wang et al., 1998).

Other markers such as Short Tandem Repeat (STR), Y chromosomal variation, and mitochondrial variations have been used for the same purpose widely (Agrawal and Khan, 2005; Karafet et al., 2008; Mountain and CavalliSforza, 1997; Torroni et al., 2006).

SNPs have some advantages as (a) they are highly abundant in whole human genome compared to STR, (b) they can be detected with high efficiency by genotyping, and (c) they are preserved over generations compared to the Y chromosome and the mitochondrial genome.

In phylogeny, the search for a minimum marker number has a long history (Felsenstein, 1988; Lecointre et al., 1994; Liu and Muse, 2005; Zharkikh and Li, 1992a; Zharkikh and Li, 1992b).

Earlier studies have mainly used sequence itself over species.

When phylogeny was used as a tool in human evolution and relationship study between ethnicities, so many issues surfaced: genetic distance calculation method, tree drawing method, and marker type disputes (Glover et al., 2010; Lin and Nei, 1991; Nei, 1978a; Nei, 1978b; Nei and Roychoudhury, 1974; Tateno et al., 1994).

The cause of these arguments were mainly that human phylogeny is a study of microevolution.

Nowadays, SNPs are being utilized for relationship inferences (Hinch et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010; Travis, 2009).

However, the elementary question, regarding the minimum marker number one can use to establish phylogenyrelated ethnicity in humans remains unsolved.

In the phylogenic analysis, more SNPs give more information contents, and, hence, a more accurate phylogenic tree.

However, when subsets of SNPs should be tested for a simulation or a hypothesis, there should be a criteria for a minimum number of markers.

Furthermore, for cases using highly related sample groups (ethnicities) or numerous sample groups at a time, the need for the minimum marker number becomes larger.

Here, we report the minimum number of SNP that can be used for a robust phylogenic analysis with a highly related 63 Pan Asian ethnic groups.

The 63 ethnic group samples were selected from PASNPi genotyping data (Table 1).

PASNPi data were obtained from 72 PASNP ethnic and four HapMap groups.

Samples that represent 72 ethnic groups in Pan Asia were obtained from ten Asian countries and Affymetrix data from USA.

1,833 distinct non-duplicated individuals were genotyped with the Affymetrix 50K Xba chip probing 58,960 SNPs.

The data included HapMap data, which consists of 209 individuals representing four populations (http://www. hapmap. org/).

Common markers between PASNPi and HapMap data were 56,025.

To use the 56,025 common marker based NJ tree as a comparison reference tree in the simulation, the tree robustness was tested 1,000 times with 72 ethnic groups.

During the test, the bootstrap proportions (BPs) of 13 ethnic groups were not robust (lowest BP of the excluded groups was 44).

Because those 13 groups can adversely influence the simulation, they were filtered out to get more accurate result.

Removed ethnicities were IDKR, IDTB, MYMN, SGML, MYKN, IDTR, MYJH, MYTM, MYKS, IDSU, IDJA, IDJV, and MYBD.

Submarker sets were created from 1,000 to 30,000 SNP markers increasing 500 markers at each time.

Each sub-marker set was sampled 100 times randomly from whole 56,025 SNPs and was bootstrapped 100 times.

Bootstrapping was restricted 100 times because of the computational load.

Phylogenic trees were drawn with a neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) and a consensus tree method, Consense, in the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein, 1989).

Genetic distance based on allele frequencies of SNPs was measured with Nei’s DA distance (Nei et al., 1983).

Takezaki and Nei showed that Nei’s DA and Cavallisforza and Edwards’s chord distance were more appropriate to get a good quality of tree topologies (Takezaki and Nei, 1996).

We used the DA distance in the phylogenic analysis.

Nei’s DA distance between population X and population Y was de  BS=Mean BP of test trees of each sub sample set×100Mean BP of the reference treefined by where xij and yij are the frequencies of the i-th allele at the j-th locus in populations X and Y, respectively, mj is the number of alleles at the j-th locus, and r is the number of loci examined.

In the simulation test for the minimum SNP number required for a robust tree, jackknife and bootstrap resampling methods were executed alternatively (Lecointre et al., 1994).

As a similarity measure of tree robustness, bootstrap support (BS) was defined byBecause of a hard computing task for subsampling and bootstrapping, the simulation was performed on a Workflow-based Genomic Cyber Computing (GCC) system that is the main computing platform controlled by computationally intensive workflows in the high performance computing environment (Youn et al., 2011).

Five representative bootstrap trees from each 100 sub-sample set and the one of whole 56,025 SNPs were expressed in Fig.  1.

The whole SNP basedphylogenic tree of 63 Pan Asian ethnic groups had a stable topology when it was bootstrapped 100 times.

The lowest BP was 63 in the group of three Thailand ethnic groups (THTK, THTY, and THTL) and most of the nodes had 100% BPs.

Compared to the one of whole SNPs, tree topologies from 1,000 SNPs to 3,000 SNPs were not consistent within the 100 subsets of each random picking number.

Furthermore, the BPs were low (the lowest one was 18% in Fig.  1B, a tree of 1,000 SNPs) and, therefore, the robustness of each tree was not supported.

When 4,000 SNPs were used in the analysis (Fig.  1C), the BPs were more stable than earlier ones (the lowest one was 27% in the joint node of North East Asians).

However, they were not comparable with the one using whole SNP.

Additionally, some missgroupings were observed at the same time (IDDY and IDML, PIUI and PIUN, INSP and INEL, and etc).

In the 7,000 SNP based tree, the topology difference to the whole SNP based tree was very low, and just a few end node joint problems were observed (three Japanese ethnic groups (JP), the location of PIIR and CNWA).

BPs were high and the tree robustness was acceptable.

The lowest BP was 52% in the joint node of Indian ethnicities (INs) and that location had the same problem in the whole SNP based tree (BP was 69%).

Within the 100 random picking subsamples of the same SNP number, there was some difference in values.

Especially, the small number of SNPs (＜3,000 SNPs) resulted in higher variability of BPs, and hence, low robustness.

With the increase of an analysed SNP number, the tree robustness was improved (Fig.  2).

The mean of BP within 100 subsample sets were charted in  the Fig.  2.

The BPs with more than 7,000 SNPs were similar to the ones of whole SNP based tree (BS was more than 95%).

If SNPs in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) bin or a same haplotype block are used in a phylogenic analysis, the genetic distance and the resulting tree can be biased to the related SNPs.

Thus, the tree could be representing some partial markers that do not reflect the genome wide relationship pattern.

In a 2002 study of Gabriel and his colleagues, it was known that about 90% of LD bins span within 100kb in Asian human genome (Gabriel et al., 2002).

About 50,000 SNPs in the Affymetrix 50K chip had the proximity problem (Fig.  3).

However, since the strategy of Affymetrix marker selection reflects tag SNPs, most of the genotyped markers were not in one bin or block (Matsuzaki et al., 2004; Nicolae et al., 2006).

Furthermore, there were 63 ethnic groups involved in the analysis and they had somewhat different genomic structures within them that are not known yet.

Thus, concrete bins or blocks common within 63 ethnicities were not identifiable.

Most of the current human relationship studies use a genome-wide SNP chips (Hinch et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010; Travis, 2009).

The small number of markers has worked well within highly different ethnic groups (Agrawal and Khan, 2005; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 2003; Mountain and Cavalli-Sforza, 1997).

When highly related ethnicities or a number of ethnicities are considered in a study, a larger marker numbers will be a good strategy.

However, when a bulk of markers was used, there would be an inevitable problem of proximity between markers, which can cause a bias to some specific haplotype blocks or LD bins.

As an alternative method, based on informative marker sets were studied (Jung et al., 2010; Liu and Muse, 2005).

However, those informative marker sets could be less useful when they are used with another third ethnic group, which was not considered during the marker design itself.

Thus, random marker could be more informative within numerous ethnicities. The authors would like to thank all colleagues who contributed this study.
