Association Analysis of SERPINB5 Polymorphisms with HBV Clearance and HCC Occurrence in a Korean Population.

Serpin peptidase inhibitor, Clade B (ovalbumin), Member 5 (SERPINB5), also known as maspin, is a potent tumor suppressor gene.

It has correlations with many tumor cells, from pancreas cancer to breast cancer, so it is possible that it may also affect liver cancer.

There has also been a report that SERPINB12, a gene placed right next to SERPINB5, is expressed in liver.

For this study, 32 polymorphisms were identified in SERPINB5 by direct DNA sequencing, and 11 of them were selected to be tested with a larger scale subjects.

The association of the 11 SERPINB5 polymorphisms with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) clearance, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence and the onset age of HCC were analyzed.

There were no significant associations found between 11 SERPINB5 polymorphisms and HBV clearance.

In the case of HCC occurrence, one of the haplotypes (ht) showed association with HCC occurrence (OR=2.26, p=0.005, PCor=0.05), albeit with a low statistical power (40.8%) and haplotype frequency (0.052).

Further study with a bigger sample size will be needed to clearly verify the association between ht5 and HCC occurrence.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the more common diseases worldwide, with more than 360 million chronic carriers (Kane, 1998).

It particularly affects Asia, Africa, Southern Europe and South America (Lin & Kao, 2008), and South Korea is no exception to the virus, as it is an endemic area of the Hepatitis B virus.

There are several directions for clinical course of HBV infection, from spontaneous recovery to chronic infection, which may further develop to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Age at infection is a crucial factor on clinical outcome.

Most HBV infection occurs at birth or within 5 years after the birth, and they also become chronic carriers.

HBV causes not only Hepatitis B; chronic infection of the virus could also lead to liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

It has been noted that HBV carriers have as much as 100 times the risk of developing HCC than noncarriers (Koshy, 1998).

Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary cancer type of liver.

HCC usually develops after HBV infection or development of LC and is one of the most common types of tumors worldwide.

It generally affects men more than women, and the age of onset is usually between 30s to 50s (Kumar V, 2003).

Pathogenesis of HCC is similar to other types of cancers in that HCC develops when a mutation occurs at cellular machinery which results in faster replication of the cell and/or nullification of apoptosis.

Chronic infection of Hepatitis B or C virus aids the development of HCC because the viruses cause the immune system to attack the body’s own liver cell.

This cycle of constant damaging and repair can lead to mistakes which may then result in carcinogenesis.

Recently, it has been suggested that genetic polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of HCC (Chun et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2006; Oh et al., 2008; Park et al., 2006; Park et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2003; Shin et al., 2007).

SERPINB5 is one of serpins and a tumor suppressor gene (Sager et al., 1997), also commonly known as maspin.

Serpins are sets of proteins that are able to inhibit proteases and affect proteolytic cascades.

However, SERPINB5 is a special case, which acts as a tumor suppressor gene instead of affecting protein pathways.

SERPINB5 has previously shown the ability to suppress tumor cells in places such as bones, pancreas, and esophagus (Cai et al., 2009; Hall et al., 2008; Hong et al., 2009).

From these findings, it can be inferred that SERPINB5 has a potent ability to suppress tumor cells.

It has also been reported that SERPINB12, a member of SERPIN family and a gene that is resided right next to SERPINB5, is expressed in liver (Askew et al., 2001).

SEPRINB12 also affects many tissues of body, including pancreas and bone marrows, which are same parts that are affected by SERPINB5.

Therefore, we can also infer that SERPINB5 may affect liver as well.

As mentioned above, genetic change may be a factor of HCC carcinogenesis, so we hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms of SERPINB5 could influence HBV clearance or HCC development of HBV infected patients.

A total of 1,074 Korean subjects having either present or past evidence of HBV infection were prospectively enrolled from the outpatient clinic of the liver unit or from the Center for Health Promotion of Seoul National University Hospital between January 2001 and August 2003.

Subjects were placed in two different groups according to serologic markers: the chronic carrier (CC) group, or the spontaneous recovery (SR) group.

The CC and SR cohorts consisted of 639 and 435 subjects, respectively (Table 1).

The diagnoses of the CC and SR subjects were established by repeated seropositivity for the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (EnzygnostⓇ HBsAg 5.0; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) over a 6-month period, and for both anti-HBs (EnzygnostⓇ Anti-HBs II; Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) and anti-HBc (AB-Corek; DiaSorin s. r. l., Saluggia, Italy) of the IgG type without HBsAg, respectively.

Asymptomatic HBV carriers were also included in CC group.

These patients usually have inactive liver disease on liver biopsy.

However, it has been known that in these patients, HBV continues to replicate, albeit very low levels, some patients have residual liver disease, and HCC develop frequently.

We excluded subjects who were positive for anti-HBs but not for anti-HBc, and those positive for antiHCV or antiHIV (GENEDIAⓇ; Greencross Life Science Corp., Yonginshi, Korea, HCVⓇ3.2; DongA Pharmaceutical Co., Seoul, Korea).

The patients who had any other types of liver disease such as autoimmune hepatitis, toxic hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or Budd Chiari syndrome were also excluded.

No patients had a previous history of immunosuppression or antiviral treatment.

Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and the Institutional Review Board of Human Research at Seoul National University Hospital approved the study protocol.

The clinical parameters are summarized in Table 1.

In order to discover genetic variants, we have sequenced exons and their flanking regions, including the promoter region (1.4 kb) in 24 Korean unrelated individual DNA samples using the ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Primer sets for the amplification and sequencing analysis of SERPINB5 were designed based on GenBank sequences (Ref. Genome seq. ; NC_000018.9).

Sequence analysis was carried out using SeqManⓇ software.

For genotyping of eleven polymorphic sites, amplifying primers and probes were designed for TaqManⓇ (An et al., 2002).

Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) was used to design both the PCR primers and the MGB TaqMan probes.

One allelic probe was labeled with the FAM dye and the other with the fluorescent VIC dye.

These probes are listed in Supplement Table 1.

Typically, PCR was run in the TaqMan Universal Master mix without UNG (Applied Biosystems) at primer concentration of 900 nM and TaqMan MGBprobe concentration of 200 nM.

The reaction was performed in a 384-well format in a total reaction volume of 5 ul using 20 ng of genomic DNA.

The plate was then placed in a thermal cycler (PE 9700, Applied Biosystems) and heated for 2 min at 50oC and for 10 min at 95oC, followed by 40 cycles of 95oC for 15 s and 60oC for 1 min.

The TaqMan assay plate was then transferred to a Prism 7900HT instrument (Applied Biosystems) where the fluorescence intensity of each well was read.

Fluorescence data files from each plate were analyzed by automated software (SDS 2.1).

Primer sequences are listed in Supplement Table 2.

We examined Lewontin’s D’ (|D’|) and LD coefficient r2 between all pairs of biallelic loci (Hedrick, 1987).

Haplotypes of each individual were inferred using the algorithm (PHASE) developed by Stephens et al.(Stephens et al., 2001), which uses a Bayesian approach incorporating a priori expectations of haplotypic structure from population genetic and coalescent theory.

Genetic effects of inferred haplotypes were analyzed in the same way as SNPs.

Logistic regression models were used for calculating odds ratios (95% confidential interval) and corresponding p-values controlling for age (continuous value) and sex (male=0, female=1) as covariates.

In our analysis of HCC occurrence, LC (LC=1, no LC=0) and HBeAg (negative=0, blank=1, positive=2) were also used as covariates.

Cox models were used for calculating relative hazards and Pvalues controlling for sex, adjusted age (0, ＜40; 1, 40∼60; and 2, ＞60; classification factor), LC (Liver Cirrhosis) (LC=0, no LC=1; classification factor) and HBeAg (negative=0, positive=1; classification factor).

In order to achieve the optimal correction for multiple testing of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with each other, the effective number of independent marker loci (9.997) in SERPINB5 was calculated using the software, on the basis of the spectral decomposition (SpD) of matrices of pair-wise LD between SNPs (http://genepi. qimr. edu. au/ general/daleN/SNPSpD/).

Statistical power is calculated with PGA matlab application (Menashe et al., 2008).

PGA is an application specifically designed to calculate statistical power and other values of casecontrol genetic association studies.

For the present study, a codominant (1df) model with relative risk 1.3, disease prevalence value 7.1% (Lee et al., 1998; Vildozola Gonzales & Salinas, 2009), EDF (Effective Degree of Freedom) 2, and alpha error level 5% were used to calculate the statistical power.

There were 32 observed polymorphisms in SERPINB5, and 11 of them were selected to be genotyped in a larger samples (n=1,074) based on their minor allele frequencies (MAF), linkage disequilibriums (LD), and locations.

The SNPs selected are rs62099999, rs55958273, rs17071138, rs57171297, rs3744940 in promoter region, rs2292294 in Exon 3, rs12454742 in Exon 5, rs2289520 in Exon 6, and rs1455556, rs1455555, rs11542560 in Exon 8 (Fig. 1A and Table 2).

Some of the polymorphisms located in exon induced amino acid change, and they were rs2292294 (alanine at 12 to alanine), rs12454742 (proline at 111 into proline), rs2289520 (valine at 187 into leucine), rs1455556 (serine at 298 into serine), and rs1455555 (valine at 319 into isoleucine) (Table 2).

MAFs of each polymorphism are also shown on Fig. 1A and Table 2, and the statistical powers for each polymorphism are shown in Table 3.

The frequencies of haplotypes are listed in Fig. 1B, and haplotype p-values and association analyses of HBV clearance and HCC occurrence are listed in Table 3.

There were six major haplotypes with MAF bigger than 0.05, which accounted for 74.6% of total distribution.

LDs among the polymorphisms of SERPINB5 are listed in Fig. 1C.

Association analyses results of SERPINB5 for HBV clearance are shown in Table 3.

There was no significant association found with SNPs and haplotypes in the case of HBV clearance (p＞0.05).

The results for HCC occurrence initially had two associations found, with the rs17071138 (p=0.05, OR=0.58, 95% CI (0.34∼0.99)) and one of the haplotypes, SEPIRNB5 ht5 ([A-T-T-G-C-T-C-C-C-T-A-T]) (p=0.005, OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.28∼3.99)).

The initial association disappeared for rs17071138 when the p-value was adjusted for the multiple testing (correction value=9.997), but ht5 retained the association ever after the correction (PCor=0.05).

However, the statistical power and MAF of ht5 was low for the data to be completely trustworthy (statistical power=40.8%, MAF=0.052).

To analyze the role of SERPINB5 polymorphisms in the onset age of HCC, Cox relative hazards analysis for age of HCC occurrence was run for CC groups.

There were no significant associations observed after correction for the multiple testing (Table 3).

SERPINB5 has been associated with prostate cancer, breast cancer (Shao et al., 2008), pancreas cancer (Kashima et al., 2008; Maass et al., 2001) and various types of carcinomas (Bal et al., 2008; Blandamura et al., 2006; Cai et al., 2009).

Also, SERPINB12, a member of SERPIN family and a gene placed next to SERPINB5, is expressed in liver, among various parts of body (Askew et al., 2001).

The gene has been discovered in relatively recent time (Khalkhali-Ellis, 2006), so there are still unknown facts about SERPINB5, which implies that SERPINB5 may have unidentified function and effects helpful for human population.

From this reasoning, the gene was selected to examine whether it has relations with HBV and HCC.

Polymorphisms of SERPINB5 were screened and 11 variants were selected to test their relations with HBV clearance and HCC occurrence.

There were no significant associations found between HBV clearance and the genetic polymorphisms.

SERPINB5 is primarily known as a tumor suppressor gene, so the result is reasonable in that HBV infection is just a precursor of HCC.

In the case of HCC occurrence analysis, ht5 showed some relations in co-dominant model (p=0.005, PCor=0.05, OR=2.26, 95% CI (1.28∼3.99)).

By looking at this result only, it would mean that ht5 has association with HCC occurrence.

However, although ht5 showed association with HCC occurrence, it had a low statistical power (40.8%) and haplotype frequency (0.052), meaning the susceptible population was of a small size and unreliable.

Therefore, it is still unsure whether ht5 really had an association with HCC occurrence or was just a false positive association, thus the association may need to be studied again in the future with bigger sample number, preferably with a higher number of subjects that exhibit ht5 haplotypes.

Although SEPRINB5 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in other parts of body as mentioned above, association analyses show that it does not play a significant role in the case of HBV clearance or HCC occurrence overall, at least in the genetic polymorphisms we studied.

In summary, 11 SNPs of SEPRINB5 that were tested did not have any significant relations with HBV clearance.

In the case of HCC occurrence, one of the haplotypes, ht5 showed a minor association with HCC occurrence, but there is a possibility that it might have shown the association due to the small sample size and low frequency value.

Therefore, this may need to be further studied in the future with a bigger number of subjects.

SERPINB5 still has potential to be a tumor suppressor gene for other parts of the body, so future research may focus on relations between SERPINB5 and other types of cancers.

However, it seems that SERPINB5 does not influence development of HCC or have association with HBV clearance, at least in the studied genetic polymorphisms, although this does not rule out SERPINB5 from the candidate genes of HBV clearance or HCC occurrence altogether, because there are still many unknown aspects of genes, and many current researches are focusing on those aspects, such as copy number variations and methylations of DNA.

Therefore, it is premature to say that SERPINB5 does not influence HBV clearance or HCC occurrence on any level.
