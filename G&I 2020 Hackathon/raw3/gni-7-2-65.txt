Identification of 1,531 cSNPs from Full-length Enriched cDNA Libraries of the Korean Native Pig Using in Silico Analysis.

 Sequences from the clones of full-length enriched cDNA libraries serve as valuable resources for functional genomics related studies, genome annotation and SNP discovery. We analyzed 7,392 high-quality chromatograms (Phred value ≥30) obtained from sequencing the 5' ends of clones derived from full-length enriched cDNA libraries of Korean native pigs including brainstem, liver, cerebellum, neocortex and spleen libraries. In addition, 50,000 EST sequence trace files obtained from GenBank were combined with our sequences to identify cSNPs in silico. The process generated 11,324 contigs, of which 2,895 contigs contained at least one SNP and among them 610 contigs had a minimum of one sequence from Korean native pigs. Of 610 contigs, we randomly selected 262 contigs and performed in silico analysis for the identification of cSNPs. From the results, we identified 1,531 putative coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) and the SNP detection frequency was one SNP per 465 bp. A largescale sequencing result of clones from full-length enriched cDNA libraries and identified cSNPs will serve as a useful resource to functional genomics related projects such as a pig HapMap project in the near future. The pig, one of the fist animals domesticated over 7000 years ago, is the major meat supply resource consumed worldwise (Rothschild, 2003). Further more, the porcine has served as sensitive and comprehensive tools to address biomedical, agricultural and fundamental biological questions (Tuggle et al., 2007). To better comprehend the physiological complexity of the pig genome, a funtional gene analysis needs to be accomplished. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent form of DNA variations in the genome of organisms and useful for association studies, gene mapping and phylogenetic studies (Brookes, 1999; Dimmic et al., 2005; Kim, et al., 2007; Kim, et al., 2008; Komar, 2007). They provide genomic landmarks of past events shaping individuals, breeds and species (Lee et al. 2006a). Owing to high abundance and stability of SNPs in the genome, thousands of potentially informative SNP markers can be discovered and used to develop highdensity SNP maps (Panitz et al., 2007; Zimdahl et al., 2004). These maps are an essential resource for the identification of genes that are responsible for variations in complex traits or quantitative trait loci (QTL; Glazier et al., 2002; Rothschild et al., 2007). SNPs are classically identified by direct sequencing of amplicons of candidate genes from a set of individuals that represent the diversity in the interested populations. The draw backs of this approach are laborious and expensive (Useche et al. 2001). A fast and costefficient approach to identify a multitude of novel SNPs involving in mining sequence data from public repositories needed to be developed. The improvement of sequence trace data in public repositories at the DNA chromatogram level was required (Panitz et al., 2007). An alternative and cheaper method of SNP identification exploits the redundancy of gene sequences generated by expressed sequence tags (ESTs; Gu et al., 1998). In this scenario, each SNP would also be associated with an expressed gene. EST information has been used for the detection of SNPs in mammalian genomes by many groups (Buetow et al., 1999; Fitzsimmons et al., 2004; Garg et al., 1999; Guryev et al., 2004; Hawken et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2006a; Lee et al., 2006b; PicoultNewberg, et al., 1999). Many conventional cDNA libraries have been constructed with porcine material. As of May 2009, 1,532,429 ESTs were available in the GenBank porcine EST database and 167,740 SNPs were achievable in the GenBank pig SNP database (Table 1). Several researchers have reported mining cSNPs from porcine EST sequences (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007; Fahrenkrug et al., 2002; Grapes et al., 2006; Kollers et al., 2005; Panitz et al., 2007; Park et al., 2009; Uenishi et al., 2004). Recently, full-length enriched cDNA libraries have also been constructed (Chen et al., 2006; Dirisala et al., 2005; Fujisaki et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Uenishi et al. 2007; Uenishi et al., 2004). Although the number of ESTs has increased significantly, less progress has been made in analyzing this large volume of emerging data, and a multitude of markers is necessary for the identification of economically important traits in pigs (Kollers et al., 2005). A large-scale cSNP mining from EST sequences has been reported by the Sino-Danish pig genome sequencing initiative (Panitz et al., 2007), these cSNPs were analyzed using cDNA sequences constructed by conventional methods. However, sequences from fulllength enriched cDNA libraries serve as more valuable resources for functional genomics studies than sequences from conventional cDNA libraries as they extend further towards the 5' end and represent a critical tool for improving the quality of many genomic annotation parameters (Das et al., 2001; Haas et al., 2002). In spite of that, data from the analysis of full-length enriched cDNA libraries constructed using pig tissues and cells are still limited (Chen et al., 2006; Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007; Fujisaki et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006; Uenishi et al., 2004, 2007). In this report, we have evaluated the process of cSNP discovery using the five full-length enriched cDNA libraries of Korean native pigs from cerebellum, liver, brainstem, neocortex and spleen libraries as a diverse genetic resource. In the result, 1,531 new cSNPs from 262 contigs were identified from the in silico analysis of the sequences from these libraries and the trace data files from the public database. The Korean native pig is a mediumsize pig with black coat color originating in the Korean peninsula (Kim et al., 2005). Neocortex, brainstem, liver, cerebellum, and spleen tissues were dissected from Korean native pigs that were maintained at the Jeju livestock experiment station in Jeju, Korea. The tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80oC until use. The neocortex, cerebellum and spleen libraries were constructed using a SMART kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA). The brainstem and liver library were constructed by the modified oligocapping and modified vectorcapping method (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007), respectively. Plasmid DNA was prepared in the 96well plate format using multiwell filter plates (Pall Corporation, Greenvale, NY, USA). Sequencing of cloned cDNA inserts was performed using an ABI PRISM Bigdye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and resultant sequences were analyzed on ABI 3700 automated sequencers. The 7,392 EST sequences with highquality chromatograms were transferred into the Linux workstation. The method for bioinformatic analysis of fulllength cDNA clones were performed as previously described (Park et al., 2009). Briefly, EST sequence trace files were base called using Phred (Ewing & Green, 1998a; Ewing et al., 1998b) with the options trim_alt and trim_phd. Sequences assessed for having a Phred quality score higher than 30 in 20 bp windows were subjected to Cross_match (P. Green, Unpublished) for vector trimming. RepeatMasker was used for removing repeat sequences (http://repeatmasker. genome. washington. edu/; A. F. A. Smit and P. Green, Unpublished). The processed sequences were assembled into contigs by Phrap (http://bozeman. mbt. washington. edu/phrap. docs/ phrap. html), integrated with Polyphred (http://droog. mbt. washington. edu/PolyPred. html) for finding SNP candi date sites and viewed with the Consed program (http://bozeman. mbt. washington. edu/cosed/Consed. html) using the polymorphism option (Gordon et al., 1998). The polymorphic sites were identified, and the results were confirmed in individual chromatograms. The new cSNPs were determined by comparing our data with NCBI BLAST (http://www.ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/BLAST/) and the previously published paper (Park et al., 2009). Library titers for the cerebellum and liver libraries were 5.0×105 pfu and 6.5×104 cfu, respectively. The average cDNA insert size estimated by restriction analysis of 20 clones picked up randomly from each library was 1.7 kb and 1.1 kb for the cerebellum and liver libraries, respectively. The analysis of other characteristics of libraries was performed as previously described (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007). A total of the 7,392 clones from five fulllength enriched libraries (4,416 from cerebellum, 288 from liver, 1,056 from brainstem, 672 from spleen, 960 from neocortex) randomly picked into 96 well plates was sequenced from the only 5' end direction. Although it is debatable to set the criteria for full-length clones, we used the presence of translation initiation codon ‘ATG’ in the cDNA sequences as the definition. According to our definition, the percentage of full-length clones was estimated to be 50% and 75% for the cerebellum and the liver libraries, respectively (data not shown). The percentage of full length clones for neocortex, brain stem and spleen was 40%, 80% and 60%, respectively (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007). Since these libraries were specifically constructed for generating full-length clones, 65% of clones had longer 5' end sequences than currently available EST sequences in the GenBank EST database. To further evaluate the characteristics of five libraries, 610 contigs containing at least one sequence of the Korean native pig was selected and analyzed (Table 2). The result showed that 98% of sequences were matched with sequences of either pigs or other species with an E value ＜10−100. We analyzed cDNA clones from five libraries where the cerebellar and liver libraries were constructed in this study and the neocotex, spleen and brainstem libraries were from our previous study (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007) by 5' end sequencing, and a total of 7,392 highquality chromatograms (Phred value ≥30) were obtained from sequencing the 5' ends of clones. Furthermore, 50,000 chromatograms of porcine EST sequences were retrieved from the GenBank trace file archive, combined with the sequencing results from the cDNA libraries and analyzed for the presence of cSNPs. The process yielded a total of 11,324 contigs, and 2,895 out of 11,324 contigs had cSNPs (data not shown). As we were interested in identifying cSNPs using Korean native pig sequences, only 610 contigs which had overlapping regions contributed by at least one sequence each from GenBank and Korean native pig were chosen for further analysis. The remaining contigs assembled only with Genbank sequences were excluded from our analysis. Of 610 contigs, only a part of contigs (262) were randomly selected for the discovery of cSNPs in this study due to the limitation from the manual confirmation of generated data through bioinformatic analysis. The analysis yielded the discovery of 1,533 cSNPs including 2 previously reported among the contigs containing Korean native pig sequences. We analyzed the contribution in number of cDNA sequences for each contig used in cSNP discovery (Table 3). A total of 59 contigs were consisted of both one Korean native pig and one GenBank sequences which is the most abundant type. Out of 610 contigs, 182 were from the group with one Korean native pig sequence and at least one GenBank sequence. One hundred three contigs contained two Korean native pig sequences and at least one public EST sequence. Our primary goal for this study was to discover new cSNPs for pigs and to test the efficiency of cSNP identification by mixing cDNA sequences of fulllength enriched cDNA libraries constructed from Korean native pigs and GenBank sequences. The application of our study using the cDNA sequences of Korean native pigs as a source of genetic diversity in the porcine genome can provide additional resources for the identification of cSNPs. The genetic relationship between Korean native pigs and other pig breeds was expected to be rather distant (Porter, 1993). Thus, we predicted that there would be a higher possibility of identifying genetic differences between Korean native pigs and other breeds than between the commonly used breeds alone. The use of full-length enriched cDNA libraries also allowed to detect SNPs in the promoter regions of genes (Dirisala et al., 2005, 2007; Park et al., 2009) The observed differences in SNP detection frequency arising from these reports might reflect genetic diversity within species and/or differences in application methods. In humans, the SNP detection frequency is reported to be about 1 SNP per 700 bp across the whole genome (The International SNP Map Working Group, 2001), and in some regions it is as high as 1 SNP per 300 bp (Wang et al., 1998). In chickens, the frequency of putative SNPs was variously reported to be 1 SNP per 2,119 bp (Kim et al., 2003) to 1 SNP per 1,900 bp (Fitzsimmons et al., 2004). In Korean native cattle, the SNP detection frequency of 1 SNP per 787 bp has been reported (Lee et al., 2006b). In our previous study, in which a small number of Korean native pig sequences and a relatively high stringency were used in selecting the candidate sequences, an in silico method yielded 1 SNP per 614 bp (Park et al., 2009). The results are very similar to our results in this study. The removal of false SNPs from a large cSNP dataset generated from a large scale cDNA sequencing project is a difficult process since the most reliable method for the evaluation of SNPs is experimental confirmation based on animals genotyping against genetically diverse populations. One possible idea to solve this problem is to exploit the redundancy of cSNPs with existing EST sequences. If we can develop an algorithm to select the SNPs from polymorphisms existing in multiple times in the public database and evaluate some statistical values for the probability, it will greatly help to utilize this type of in silico approach for SNP discovery.
