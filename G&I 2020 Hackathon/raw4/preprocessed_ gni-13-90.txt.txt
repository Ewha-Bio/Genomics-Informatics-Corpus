The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) defines biodiversity as “the variety of life on Earth and the natural patterns” [1, 2].   CBD has underlined the importance of abundant biodiversity in the sustainable use of natural resources [3].   Moreover, maintaining biological coexistence for all organisms on earth, including animals, plants, and microbes, is imperative for human welfare and quality of life [4].   Thus, many researchers use quantitative measures of biodiversity in an attempt to sustain and restore ecosystems [5].  Biodiversity is generally measured by statistical indices based on the emergence and/or existence of various organisms such as plants, animals, and microbes; these indices can provide quantitative criteria with increased confidence for biodiversity [6, 7].   Of the statistical indices, Shannon-Wiener index [8], species richness, and evenness [9] have been widely used as the gold standards, in spite of traditional methods.   The Shannon-Wiener index is based on information theory and is measured using the concept of entropy, and it is applied to estimate the degree of species diversity in a region [10].   Species richness and evenness measure the number of different species per sample and the relative abundance of the different species, respectively [11].  For measuring biodiversity, there are a few non-commercial tools, such as the Vegan package in R [12], EstimateS [13], and the web-based Shannon Entropy Calculator (http:// www.  changbioscience.  com/genetics/shannon.  html).   Although they are highly useful, some of them are difficult and complicated for biologists to use, especially some programs involving R package.   While the web-based tools are easy to use, they are not suitable for personal and/or big data sets.   Furthermore, some programs do not serve any function for long-term investigations of data sets using time-series analyses for biodiversity.  We developed the VBioindex tool to aid scientists in evaluating the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and evenness.   Additionally, this program depicts relative dominance for each species.   As VBioindex supports biodiversity analyses for a given period (e.  g., for a month, quarter, or year), users can easily analyze a variety of biodiversity data while applying a time-series analysis.VBioindex

VBioindex supports four statistical indicesthe Shannon- Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and the relative dominance of speciesthat are widely used as important criteria to evaluate ecosystems.  The Shannon-Wiener index (H´) was designed to predict the next letter of communication in a random set of data and to quantify entropy in terms of uncertainty or information content [10].   It has been widely applied in a variety of fields, such as biology and ecology.   H´ is measured using entropy with the proportion of individuals (n) for total emerged species (s) [10].   Species richness (D), known as Margalef’s richness index, is a measure of the variety of species in a given area or sample [10], which is calculated based on emerged species (s), and the individuals (n) of total emerged species [14].  Species evenness (E) is the degree of the distribution of individual organisms among species [15], which is measured using H´ and the log of emerged species (s) [16].  Relative dominance (RD) is the frequency of individuals of a species, which generally presents the degree of dominance for a species as a percentage [17].  ×100VBioindex is implemented by clicking a few buttons, such as Open, Save, and some selectable radio buttons (Fig.   1A).   An input data file is accepted as a tab-delimited file, labeled with the date, species name, and number of individuals (Fig.   1B).   The results of the four methods are graphically represented charts with a tab-delimited text output file (Fig.   1C).   Along with presenting these biodiversity indices, VBioindex allows time-series analyses at a monthly, quarterly, and yearly basis for all statistical methods, the functions of which are useful in analyzing long-term species diversity.   VBioindex is programmed in Java language (higher than version 1.7), and it can be used in all operating systems in which a Java Virtual Machine has been installed.  Conclusion

Statistical indices evaluating ecology, such as the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance, are considered important criteria to sustain and restore ecosystems.   Although there are a few programs for these indices, some programs are inconvenient to use and do not support various indices.   We developed VBioindex, a user-friendly program that is capable of measuring the Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, evenness, and relative dominance.   In addition, VBioindex offers options with which a user can analyze a variety of biodiversity data while applying a time-series analysis.   VBioindex outputs a tab-delimited text file with visual charts and users can use the output text file with links to other statistical programs for a variety of ecological studies such as comparative analyses between many datasets.   VBioindex is publically accessible at http://sourceforge.  net/projects/ vbioindex/.  Acknowledgments
